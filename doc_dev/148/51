<HEAD>Maryland Voters Won't Get Abortion Law; Guam Measure Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   A complicated legislative compromise to put abortion before
Maryland voters apparently has been derailed, and a federal judge
on Guam temporarily blocked the U.S. island territory's new
abortion law, the nation's strictest.
   Either the Guam law or a less stringent measure awaiting the
governor's signature in Idaho could be the vehicle to challenge the
U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized abortion.
   The Maryland measure, which emerged from the state Senate after
an eight-day filibuster by anti-abortion forces, was rejected
Friday by a House of Delegates committee.
   The unusual arrangement would have required the legislature to
pass two measures: one permitting unrestricted access to abortions
during the early stages of pregnancy, the other restricting
abortion to cases of rape, incest or dire threat to the mother. In
essence, the voters, through referendum, would have decided between
the two measures.
   Legislators who advocate abortion rights generally opposed the
compromise, while anti-abortion lawmakers favored putting the issue
before the electorate.
   ``We think the process would be far too confusing for voters,''
said Delegate Patricia R. Sher, a Democrat who supports a woman's
right to choose abortion. Abortion-rights forces, she added, feared
the amount ``of money that the churches would bring in here would
be awesome.''
   Democratic Sen. Francis X. Kelly, a leading abortion foe and one
of 16 senators who mounted the filibuster, noted that the group's
original goal _ to block the abortion-rights bill _ was met.
   ``I can't say I'm unhappy,'' Kelly said, ``But from the
experience, I believe the voters should decide. It's a shame the
voters won't be able to.''
   The House Environmental Matters Committee voted 13-12 against
the package Friday night.
   The measure could be revived on the House floor, but that was
considered unlikely because of House Democratic leadership
opposition.
   In Agana, Guam, U.S. District Judge Alex Munson issued a
temporary restraining order Friday blocking enforcement of the
territory's new law, a few hours after residents and medical groups
filed a class-action lawsuit. He scheduled a hearing for Monday on
whether to extend his order.
   Guam's law, which Gov. Joseph Ada signed this week, prohibits
abortions except when a pregnancy endangers the life of the mother.
It makes it a felony to perform abortion or aid in the procedure,
and a misdemeanor for a woman to solicit or have an abortion, or
for a person to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   It provides for a referendum Nov. 6 for voters to decide whether
to retain the law.
   The lawsuit alleges the measure violates constitutional
guarantees of privacy, due process, free speech, equal protection
and religious freedom.
   Also Friday, Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus was the target of a brief
sit-in by high-school students demanding he veto an abortion bill
approved by the legislature Thursday.
   The measure, the strictest yet approved by a state legislature,
would ban abortion except in cases of non-statutory rape reported
within seven days, incest if the victim is younger than 18, severe
fetal deformity or threat to the mother's life or health.
   Andrus, an opponent of abortion, hasn't said if he intends to
sign the bill.
   Abortion-rights groups in California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Rhode
Island and North Carolina have threatened to boycott Idaho potatoes
if Andrus fails to veto the bill.
