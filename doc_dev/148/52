   A pop-up scarecrow and a snowplow-proof
mailbox were just some of the gizmos displayed at the second-annual
North Dakota Inventors Congress.
   Peter Konzak of Devils Lake rummaged through the clutter of his
briefcase and found a letter to prove his scarecrow has already
earned him some attention.
   ``I am still invited to the Johnny Carson show. It is a standing
invitation,'' the 66-year-old retired farmer said.
   Forty inventors and manufacturers, most of them from North
Dakota, showed off their gadgets and thingamajigs at the show,
which ended Tuesday.
   The hinged mailbox was devised by a Minot man after a neighbor
complained about his mailbox getting knocked down by snowplows each
winter.
   Konzak's pride and joy stood at one side of his booth on the
floor of the Jamestown Civic Center. It's a steel contraption
wearing fluorescent work gloves that sports a dummy's head adorned
with a cowboy hat. A battery and propane tank give it life.
   In a sunflower field, the clumsy-looking ``pest-scaring device''
jumps up, twirls and whistles to keep blackbirds from feasting on
the seeds, Konzak said Monday.
   ``All you need is one on 40 acres,'' he said. ``With the buzzer
in here and all the stuff, it can pay for itself in one year.''
   Since receiving a patent for his mechanical scarecrow in April
1986, Konzak has made about 30 of them and sold them all at about
$500 apiece, he said.
   But he said he hasn't made any money yet. ``I've just made my
expenses. I put $20,000 into patenting this thing.''

   When Guam Gov. Joseph F. Ada checked out of a
Washington hotel earlier this week, the hotel declined to take a
Guam government check for payment of room charges.
   ``The hotel management said it couldn't accept the check because
Guam is a foreign country,'' Ada said Tuesday during a stop in
Honolulu on the way home.
   ``We told them that Guam is a U.S. territory where America's day
begins.''
   Guam long has been an unincorporated U.S. territory in the
western Pacific, about 3,800 miles west of Hawaii.
   ``They said they would give me credit because I was attending
the National Governors Association meeting,'' he said. ``What the
hotel didn't realize is that they will receive the same government
check for payment.''

   The president of Connecticut's
third-largest bank is trading his pin stripes for dancing tights to
help promote corporate support of the arts.
   David Carson, 53, president and chief executive officer of
People's Bank in Bridgeport, will play the role of the Duke of
Courland in the ballet ``Giselle,'' to be performed March 11-12 by
the Connecticut Ballet Theater in Stamford.
   The production also will feature Stephanie Saland, principal
dancer with the New York City Ballet.
   ``The bank has supported the theater, but I think you can
support the arts with not just money, but with your presence,
too,'' said Carson.
   The ballet was looking for ``a very regal type of person,'' and
it decided to approach Carson, said Brett Raphael, the company's
artistic director.
   ``It occurred to me that this was natural casting if possible,
however far-fetched,'' Raphael said. ``It's not every day a
corporate personality takes time out of his schedule to dabble in a
very different art form.''
   Said Carson, ``It appealed to my sense of humor, and if it helps
give the ballet some recognition, that's great.''
   Carson will do some mime and walk to music, rather than dance.
But, he asked, ``When does walking in time become dancing?''
