   Two independent polls released
Sunday showed former Sen. Lawton Chiles with a comfortable lead
over ex-congressman Bill Nelson going into Tuesday's Democratic
primary for governor of Florida.
   Both polls had Chiles virtually even in polls with Republican
Gov. Bob Martinez.
   The Florida Opinion Poll, published by The New York Times
Florida newspapers, showed Chiles with 44 percent of the Democratic
voters to 32 percent for Nelson, a six-term congressman.
Twenty-four percent were undecided.
   The poll was conducted through random telephone interviews of
842 registered voters Aug. 25-29. Its margin of error was 4 percent.
   The Florida Newspaper Poll published Sunday gave Chiles a 55-30
margin over Nelson, with only 15 percent undecided.
   That poll, for the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, The Orlando
Sentinel and The Florida Times-Union, interviewed 750 registered
voters Aug. 25-27, and had a margin of error of 4 points.
   Sunday's polls gave Martinez landslide margins over his nearest
GOP competitor, state Sen. Marlene Woodson Howard, and also put him
nearly even in a match-up with Chiles.
   The Florida Newspaper Poll gave Chiles a 45-40 lead over
Martinez. The New York Times Newspapers poll indicated Chiles had a
45-41 lead.

   Territorial Sen. Madeleine Z. Bordallo won
the Democratic nomination for governor and will face Gov. Joseph
Ada as she seeks to reoccupy the office her late husband lost to
Ada in 1986.
   Mrs. Bordallo garnered 11,240 votes in Saturday's vote to defeat
Lt. Gov. Rudolph G. Sablan, who had 7,511 votes.
   Ada, a Republican, ran unopposed and received 7,986 votes.
   Mrs. Bordallo, a 57-year-old Minnesota native, would become
Guam's first woman governor and the first who is not a native
Guamanian.
   She came to Guam in 1948 when her father accepted a position as
a high school principal. Her husband, the late Gov. Ricardo
Bordallo, was defeated by Ada in 1986 after Bordallo was indicted
for witness tampering and obstruction.
   Last Jan. 31, Bordallo chained himself to a statue, wrapped
himself in Guam's flag and fatally shot himself in the head hours
before he was to fly to Los Angeles to begin serving a four-year
prison term.
