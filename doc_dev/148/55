mph, veered north slightly as it continued to move west across the Philippine
Sea today, U.S. military forecasters said.;   The center had received no
damage or evacuation reports related to the typhoon, which continued to move
over largely vacant waters, said U.S. Navy Lt. Thomas Cecere of the Joint

<TEXT>     Early today, the typhoon was 660 miles east of Luzon Island, where the
Philippine capital of Manila is located. The storm was expected to be 175
miles northeast of Luzon by Monday, Cecere said.;   "It will still be bigger
than a normal typhoon, but it won't be a super-typhoon" by the time it nears
Luzon, he said.;   Today the super-typhoon had sustained winds of 160 mph and
gusts up to 195 mph as it moved west-northwest at 12 mph, Cecere said. Its
peak sustained intensity was expected to reach 165 mph today. That is more
than twice the minimum wind speed for a typhoon -- 74 mph.  </TEXT>
