   Prosecutors today dropped charges against an
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer accused of violating the
nation's most restrictive abortion law by encouraging others to
seek abortions.
   The charges against Janet Benshoof were dropped by territorial
Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson. She said she acted in
part because of a lawsuit that she considers bigger test of the new
abortion law than Benshoof's case.
   Benshoof, director of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project,
was arrested March 21, two days after the law was signed, on
charges of solicitation to commit abortion.
   Benshoof, who came here from New York in hopes of persuading
Gov. Joseph Ada to veto the measure, had publicly encouraged women
seeking abortions to have them performed in Hawaii.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother.
   The law has not been enforced since a restraining order was
issued March 23. The order is to remain in place until a lawsuit
challenging the law is heard in federal court May 8.
   The lawsuit was filed by ``Marie Doe,'' a pregnant woman who
wanted an abortion, the Guam Society of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, the Guam Nurses Association, an Episcopal priest and
three doctors.
