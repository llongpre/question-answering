   A former governor of Guam facing the start of
a four-year prison term shot himself to death today while draped
Guam's national flag and chained to a statue in a busy intersection.
   Ricardo ``Ricky'' Bordallo, 63, shot himself in the head. In
addition to being wrapped in the flag, he had set up four placards,
one of which said: ``I regret that I only have one life to give to
my island,'' according to police and witnesses.
   Bordallo shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol after chaining
himself to a statue of Chief Quipuha, who was the first chief in
Guam to adopt Christianity. He died of massive brain damage at 4:28
p.m., said a spokesman at Naval Hospital.
   Bordallo had been scheduled to fly tonight to Los Angeles, where
he was to visit with his daughter. On Friday, he was due at the
federal correctional facility in Boron, Calif., to begin a
four-year prison term on witness tampering and obstruction charges.
   Bordallo was convicted in February 1987 of getting engineer
Johnny Carpio to lie to federal officials about a $60,000 political
contribution from a group of Japanese businessmen.
   According to trial testimony, Bordallo, a Democrat, admitted
accepting the money from the businessmen, but said the money was a
campaign contribution.
   Carpio was convicted in 1987 of extortion and bribery and placed
on five years' probation.
   Bordallo had served as governor of the U.S. territory from
1976-80, and was re-elected in 1984. He lost a re-election bid in
1988 to Republican Joseph Ada.
   ``My own instincts make me believe that I will not be coming
back from Boron alive,'' Bordallo said Friday in an interview with
the Pacific Daily News. ``I'm not dwelling on how it will happen. I
will be in the hands of people who are masters of intrigue.''
   Reporters who attended a farewell party for Bordallo earlier in
the day said he appeared to be in good spirits.
   The party was in the office of his wife, territorial Sen.
Madeleine Bordallo, who is considering a run for governor this year.
   ``It's a very sad day for me personally ... he was a close
personal friend during the early part of our lives,'' Guam's
congressional delegate, Ben Blaz, said from Washington, D.C.
   ``I didn't think this would happen. Ricky Bordallo always seemed
to bounce back from his many adversities.''
