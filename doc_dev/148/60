   U.S. government officials will meet with island
representatives this week to begin mapping a foreign and domestic
policy for America's far-flung possessions in the Pacific and
Caribbean.
   ``The federal government has often failed to consider the
implications,'' effects and potential of the noncontiguous Pacific
areas, Congress said in 1986 when it passed legislation ordering a
policy to be formulated.
   ``Too often the federal government fails to take into account the
effects of its foreign and domestic policies on the unique
circumstances and character of the Pacific basin,'' said Guam
Congressional Delegate Ben Blaz, a Republican.
   Not since the Carter administration in 1980 has any U.S.
administration clearly defined a policy for federal agencies to deal
with the territories.
   A two-day conference, starting Tuesday, ``will be an excellent
opportunity for island leaders to lay their concerns on the table,
but more importantly, to work with federal officials to find
solutions,'' said Stella G. Guerra, who has been assistant interior
secretary for territorial and international affairs for two months.
   Federal agency representatives, headed by Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan, will confer with officials from Hawaii, Guam, the
Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the Marshall Islands, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and the Virgin Islands.
   Guerra said discussions will target issues such as economic
development, the applicability of federal laws, social development,
U.S. foreign policy for the region and federal executive
organization.
   Of concern to Hawaii, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands are
the potential social, economic and political impact of migration of
people from the Marshalls, Federated States and Palau to urban
centers.
   The Virgin Islands were included because, although they are in
the Caribbean, they have problems in common with the Pacific
possessions, said Guerra.
   Excluding Hawaii, an estimated 350,000 people live on islands and
atolls in the almost empty expanse of the Pacific south of Japan,
east of the Philippines and north of Australia.
   What Guerra calls ``the American political family'' has been
changing, especially as the western Pacific islands move toward
their own political identities.
   In late 1986, the Reagan administration began dismantling the
U.N.-established Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
   The Northern Mariana Islands became a U.S. commonwealth.
   The Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia
became self-governing and semi-autonomous under Compacts of Free
Association. The compacts will provide the two island states a
combined $2.5 billion through the year 2001. The United States
retains responsibility for their defense and mutual security.
   Palau, the fourth Trust Territory entity, still is a trusteeship
with the Interior Department administering its affairs.
   Guam, an unincorporated U.S. territory since 1950, is seeking
commonwealth status. Legislation is pending in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
   American Samoa is in its 89th year as a U.S. territory with no
serious indication of a change in its status.
   The Virgin Islands is discussing a new political arrangement.
   The Pacific possessions have been of military importance to the
United States' defense since all but American Samoa were captured
from Japanese occupation forces in bitter fighting 45 years ago.
