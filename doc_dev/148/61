   A strong earthquake, the second in less than 24
hours, struck northeast of Guam early Saturday, according to the
Hong Kong Observatory and U.S. Geological Survey. There were no
reports of injury or damage.
   An Observatory statement said the quake registered 5.8 on the
Richter scale and was centered off the east coast of the Marianas
Islands 434 miles northeast of Guam.
   The observatory gave no further details of the quake, which
occurred at 1:04 a.m. (11:04 a.m. EDT Friday).
   Dan Finley of the U.S. Geological Service in Reston, Va.,
confirmed the quake.
   ``They did have an aftershock of 5.8 in the same location,'' he
said. ``This is normal after a big earthquake like this to have
aftershocks.''
   Earlier Friday, a quake registering 7.4 shook a section of the
Marianas Islands at 7:15 a.m. (5:15 p.m. EDT Thursday). There also
were no reports of injury or damage.
   The epicenter was 138 miles northeast of Saipan near the island
of Anatahan in the western Pacific.
   On Tuesday, all 21 residents of Anatahan, closest to the
epicenter, abandoned the island after a volcano there showed signs
of erupting.
   A Navy crew from Guam was checking the volcano Friday, but
geologists said the earlier quake and volcanic activity apparently
were unrelated.
   Anatahan and Saipan are part of the Northern Marianas chain just
north of Guam, about 1,500 miles east of the Philippines.
   An earthquake of 6 on the Richter scale can cause severe damage
in the local area. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable
of widespread heavy damage.
