   Democrats in this U.S. territory decided
Sunday to send an uncommitted delegation to the national convention
in an attempt to have more political clout when the party selects
its presidential nominee.
   ``The idea behind our uncommitted stance was to allow the Guam
delegation to discuss Guam issues so more people could become aware
of what we want,'' Daryl Taggerty, vice chairman of the party's
delegate selection committee, said Sunday following the party's
caucuses.
   Topping the list of concerns in the territory's effort to become
a commonwealth of the United States.
   Party members selected six delegates, each of whom will cast {
vote for a total of three votes.
   One member of the delegation is former territorial Gov. Ricardo
J. Bordallo, who was unseated in 1986 after he was indicted for
accepting bribes in exchange for government contracts. He was later
convicted, but remains free pending appeal in federal courts.
   Bordallo's wife, territorial Sen. Madeleine Bordallo, also was
selected as a delegate. Most of the other delegates are former
members of Bordallo's cabinet.
