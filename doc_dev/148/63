   Bond dealer Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. has
agreed to settle civil fraud charges in connection with its
underwriting of more than $1 billion in municipal bonds and the
sale of 1.5 million shares of its own stock, the government said.
   Thursday's settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission capped the first phase of an intense federal
investigation into Matthews &amp; Wright's practices in selling
municipal issues.
   SEC officials said the ``investigation of related municipal
securities matters is continuing.''
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Matthews &amp; Wright, its
president and chairman, George W. Benoit, and Roger J. Burns, its
chief financial officer, agreed to settle civil charges brought by
the SEC that they violated anti-fraud and false-reporting
provisions of federal securities laws.
   Under the settlement, Manhattan-based Matthews &amp; Wright will
give up its broker-dealer license and agree to avoid future
securities violations.
   Benoit, 52, of Pearl River, will be barred from the securities
business for at least four years and Burns, 51, of Staten Island,
will be barred for at least two years.
   The settlement, which remains subject to approval by a federal
judge, was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   Two other men, Matthews &amp; Wright executive vice president Arthur
Abba Goldberg, 48, of Jersey City, N.J., and outside counsel
Bernard M. Altoff, 58, of Rye, were not parties to the settlement,
and civil charges were filed against them, the SEC said.
   The SEC complaint charged that the four individuals and Matthews
&amp; Wright carried out a fraud scheme to underwrite tax-exempt
municipal securities ``through a series of sham closings'' to
retain favorable tax treatment.
   The complaint also charged that Matthews &amp; Wright made false and
misleading statements about the sham transactions to the SEC and to
the investing public when the firm sold 1.5 million shares of its
common stock in August 1986.
   The charges in the government's case stem from 26 municipal bond
deals in 1985 and 1986. The firm has been out of the bond
underwriting business for more than two years since its legal
troubles began.
   According to the SEC's complaint, Matthews &amp; Wright, used
worthless checks to ``buy'' 26 municipal bond issues totaling $1.32
billion in December 1985 and August 1986 before a federal tax
loophole was closed, making the bonds less attractive to investors.
   ``No real purchase occurred and they missed the tax deadline,''
explained David W. Parsons, senior counsel for the SEC in
Washington. According to the complaint, he added, investors were
not getting the tax-exempt municipal securities they thought they
were buying.
   Gary Sundick, the SEC's assistant director of enforcement,
noted, however, ``the commission is not making a determination as
to taxability of interest on the bonds.'' That was up to the
Internal Revenue Service, he said, adding that the circumstances of
the bond sales ``created increased risks concerning taxation which
should have been disclosed'' to investors.
   The complaint charged that the worthless checks were kept out of
normal banking channels and the bonds were warehoused through a
banking concern on the Pacific island of Saipan until Matthews &amp;
Wright sold them to the public.
   Last year a federal grand jury in Guam charged Goldberg with
fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. The case has since been
transferred to California.
   The SEC case does not involve the firm's best-known deals, $380
million in issues underwritten for Guam and the Northern Marianas
in 1984 and 1985, officials said.
   In addition, the SEC complaint charged that proceeds from 17 of
the 26 bond issues were used to buy guaranteed investment contracts
to ensure repayment of interest on the bonds, rather than for their
stated purpose: to finance construction projects _ including
low-income housing.
   SEC officials would not comment on whether the projects were
bogus from the start.
