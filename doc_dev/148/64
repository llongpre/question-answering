   A ship foundering in high seas with a crew of
17 headed for shelter under its own power today in the Western
Pacific after a Coast Guard plane dropped replacements for its
faulty bilge pumps.
   The 146-foot Royal Taipan had been reported in danger of sinking
after it began taking on water in 25-foot seas churned by 45 mph
tropical storm winds.
   An air-and-sea search was slowed by poor radio communication and
an inaccurate position reported by the former Navy minesweeper,
which was caught by the storm as it cruised to a shipyard for
renovations, the Coast Gurad.
   The Royal Taipan, whose owners intend to refurbish as a cruise
ship, was expected to reach Ulithi Atoll in the Federated States of
Micronesia today, Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Kent Youel said.
   The ship radioed for help Saturday night when it ran into the
fringes of Tropical Storm Abe, officials said. Someone on board
gave the ship's position as 225 miles south-southwest of Guam, the
Coast Guard said.
   It was located today by a search plane based in Hawaii that
homed in on an electronic emergency beacon about 500 miles
southwest of Guam.
   The ship was in 10- to 15-foot seas and 40 mph winds when the
pumps were dropped to the crew to replace the vessel's three failed
pumps, Youel said.
   At the atoll, the ship will be met by a patrol boat based nearby
so officers can inspect the vessel and determine its seaworthiness,
Youel said.
   The Royal Taipan, owned by Windjammer Cruises of Honolulu, had
left the Philippines for Saipan, in the Northern Mariana Islands,
said the Coast Guard. The crew reportedly was made up of Filipinos
and Americans.
