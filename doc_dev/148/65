A bill creating the nation's most restrictive abortion statute was signed 
Monday by the territorial governor. The new law was hailed by anti-abortion 
forces, but civil libertarians promised to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart, I believe that a fetus is a human being," Republican Gov. Joseph 
Ada said in signing the bill, which prohibits abortion except when the mother's 
health or life is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which was passed despite a ruling by Guam's attorney general that it 
is unconstitutional, makes it a third-degree felony for a person to perform or 
help in an abortion. Seeking or having an abortion or soliciting someone to 
have an abortion is a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
The law provides that the Nov. 6 general election ballot include a referendum 
in which residents of this Pacific Ocean island about 1,500 miles east of the 
Philippines will decide whether to retain the statute. 
</P>
<P>
Guam's 21-member unicameral Legislature unanimously approved the bill on March 
8 after Archbishop Anthony Apuron threatened in an interview with a television 
reporter to excommunicate any Roman Catholic senator who voted against it. All 
but one of the senators are Catholic, as is Ada. However, most of the senators 
said that they had been unaware of the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Territorial Atty. Gen. Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson issued an opinion on Feb. 26 
holding that the bill is unconstitutional because it violates a woman's 
constitutional right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the abortion debate agree that the new law could provide a direct 
challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 landmark Roe vs. Wade decision 
legalizing abortion on privacy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The new statute cannot coexist with Roe vs. Wade, said Janet Benshoff, director 
of the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Rivera, vice president of the anti-abortion Guamanians United for Life, 
said the law "is the ice pick that's going to chip away at the big block of 
ice" that is Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the Reproductive Freedom Project, said she 
expected immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be either a lawsuit or a negotiated agreement to suspend enforcement 
pending outcome of a lawsuit," Pine said in a telephone interview from her New 
York office. 
</P>
<P>
Among those hailing the new law was the National Right to Life Committee.
