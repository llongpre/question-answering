   A decision to change attorneys by Arthur Abba Goldberg, an executive vice president at bond house Matthews &amp; Wright Inc., has sparked a tussle between two noted criminal defense lawyers. 

   Stanley Arkin of New York and Howard Weitzman of Los Angeles are both known for their famous clientele. 
Mr. Arkin represents many well-known Wall Street names, including arbitrager Salim Lewis; Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. executive Richard Wigton; and Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. Mr. Weitzman leans toward celebrities, such as auto maker John De Lorean, and is handling the divorce of boxer Mike Tyson. 

   Mr. Weitzman, who now represents Mr. Goldberg, has accused Mr. Arkin of professional "negligence." 
Mr. Arkin -- who represented the defendant after his indictment in December 1987 -- called Mr. Weitzman's tactics "irresponsible." 
Until the dispute over the Goldberg's case, the two lawyers were friends, according to Mr. Arkin. 

   The New York bond house executive was indicted on 52 counts of bribery, conspiracy and fraud. 
He is accused of orchestrating a bogus, $300 million bond issue on Guam, one of 20 Matthews &amp; Wright underwritings under investigation in several federal jurisdictions. 
No charges have been filed against the once-bustling bond company, which now has only nine employees, according to Mr. Goldberg. 

   Mr. Goldberg's trial is scheduled for next March in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
It has been delayed because of Mr. Goldberg's efforts to substitute Mr. Weitzman as his defense counsel. 

   Mr. Goldberg said he asked Mr. Weitzman to take over his defense after a Sept. 8 meeting in Mr. Arkin's office where, according to Mr. Goldberg, Mr. Arkin displayed "a lack of knowledge" about the case, talked mostly about his $500,000 in fees, "yelled at me and was verbally abusive," and left to tape a television interview. 

   Mr. Arkin denied the charges and said a fee dispute caused the rupture between him and his client. 
His work on the case has been substantial, including several trips to Guam to interview potential witnesses and winning a change of venue from Guam to California, Mr. Arkin said. 
In court papers, Mr. Arkin said Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Weitzman have falsely "savaged" him in a ruthless tactical move to delay Mr. Goldberg's trial. 

   U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Curtis seemed to agree with Mr. Arkin, calling Mr. Goldberg's request to substitute Mr. Weitzman "clearly a delaying tactic" to push back an earlier trial date set for January. 
Even after Mr. Arkin himself requested to step down from the case because of "irreconcilable differences" with Mr. Goldberg, the judge refused to let Mr. Goldberg switch lawyers. 
But last Wednesday, the judge relented and said Mr. Weitzman could represent Mr. Goldberg as long as they could be ready for trial in March. 

   Late last week, Mr. Weitzman said he expected to handle the case. 
Mr. Arkin said he wishes Mr. Weitzman and his former client well, even though Mr. Goldberg still owes him $242,000.
