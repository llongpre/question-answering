   Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells resigned as auditor for Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc., a securities firm that is under investigation for underwriting allegedly fraudulent municipal bond issues. 

   Deloitte cited a guilty plea earlier this month in U.S. federal court in Guam by Edward K. Strauss, a Pittsburgh attorney who provided tax opinions on many bond issues underwritten by the securities firm. 
Those issues included $300 million of housing bonds issued by Guam. 

   Mr. Strauss, an attorney with the Pittsburgh law firm of Berkman Ruslander Pohl Lieber &amp; Engel, pleaded guilty to concealing knowledge of felonies committed by a former executive vice president of Matthews &amp; Wright and a former consultant to the company, and is serving as a witness for the prosecution. 

   Matthews &amp; Wright said Mr. Strauss's assertions "are completely untrue and without merit." 
It added, "We have no reason to believe that Deloitte intends to withdraw any" of its previously issued "clean opinions on the financial statements of Matthews &amp; Wright." 

   Roughly 20 municipal bond issues underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright are under investigation by federal agencies. 
At issue is whether the bonds were sold primarily for profit and without a "reasonable expectation" that the proceeds raised would be used for the stated purpose. 

   Deloitte declined to elaborate on whether the investigations into Matthews &amp; Wright transactions cast doubt upon the auditors' opinions Deloitte provided for the firm. 
Last year the law firm of Buchanan Ingersoll withdrew an opinion backing the tax-exempt status of $200 million of municipals underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright.
