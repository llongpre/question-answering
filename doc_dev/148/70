<HEAD>Court Rules Guam May Not Be Sued Over Civil Rights Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. territory of Guam and its officials
may not be sued for allegedly violating a much-used federal civil
rights law, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The justices, by a 6-2 vote, threw out part of a lawsuit filed
by six Guam residents who said police punched, kicked and
threatened them to get them to confess to drug-related crimes.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said
Congress was most concerned about the Ku Klux Klan's influence and
race relations in Southern states when it passed the 1871 law.
   The law allows those who prove government actions or policies
violated their constitutional rights to collect monetary damages.
   ``Our review of (the law's) history uncovers no sign that
Congress was thinking of the territories when it enacted the
statute,'' Blackmun said.
   The six residents who sued Guam and various officials are
Palauan, natives of the island of Palau. They have their own
culture, language and physical characteristics.
   Their lawsuit alleged that racial bias sparked police brutality.
   A federal appeals court dismissed the residents' claims against
the Guam government, the Guam Police Department and the individual
defendants in their official capacities.
   Today's decision upheld the appeals court ruling, and
effectively reduces the amount of money the Palauans may recover if
they eventually win their lawsuit.
   The Palauans had sought $100 million in damages.
   The case is Ngiraingas vs. Sanchez, 88-1281.
