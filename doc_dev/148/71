   A strong earthquake
shook a section of the Marianas Islands on Friday and rattled
windows 200 miles away, authorities said. There were no reports of
injury or serious damage.
   The quake occurred at 7:15 a.m. (5:15 p.m. Thursday EDT) and
registered 7.4 on the Richter scale, according to Bruce Presgrave,
a spokesman for the National Earthquake Information Service in
Golden, Colo.
   The epicenter was 138 miles northeast of Saipan near the island
of Anatahan in the western Pacific.
   ``A reading of 7.4 would make it a major earthquake, but the
only information we have is that it was felt on Guam,'' Presgrave
said. ``We've had no reports of damage at all.''
   ``We felt it for about 10 seconds; everything shook,'' said
Andrew Mazella, program director at radio station KSAI in Saipan.
The quake rattled windows and dishes in Guam, 220 miles southwest
of the epicenter.
   The quake slammed a 15-foot wave into Tinian, a tiny island
south of Saipan and pushed 5 feet of water into houses on Tanapag,
a village on Saipan island, said Felix Sasamoto, civil defense
coordinator for the islands.
   Some moorings broke loose in Tinian but no other damage was
reported, Sasamoto said.
   On Tuesday, all 21 residents of Anatahan, closest to the
epicenter, abandoned the island after a volcano there showed signs
of erupting.
   A Navy crew from Guam was checking the volcano Friday, but
geologists said the quake and volcanic activity apparently were
unrelated.
   ``This is different from the volcanic activity that has been
occurring in the islands,'' said Presgrave.
   Anatahan and Saipan are part of the Northern Marianas chain just
north of Guam, about 1,500 miles east of the Philippines.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 6 on the Richter scale can cause severe damage
in the local area. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable
of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.
