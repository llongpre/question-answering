   U.S.-controlled Pacific islands are convenient
gateways to the United States for heroin and other drugs from Asia
and the southwest Pacific, and the mail often is the last link in
the smuggling chain, a government document says.
   Federal drug interdiction on the islands is virtually
non-existent because of manpower shortages and cuts in anti-drug
aid to the local governments, according to an internal Interior
Department report and interviews with government officials.
   ``Access to the U.S. postal and transportation system often
contribute to making these U.S. islands transshipment points for
illegal drugs,'' said the Interior document, calling the islands
``major concerns with regard to drug trafficking.''
   In American Samoa, for example, commercial fishing boats bring
in marijuana and heroin from Australia and other Pacific nations
for mailing to U.S. residents, said the report, obtained this week
through the Freedom of Information Act.
   A local official said the island's greatest drug problem was
with marijuana, and although use of the port for heroin smuggling
has long been suspected, there has never been a heroin seizure.
   ``We hear about (heroin) from intelligence sources, but we have
nothing concrete,'' said Michael Sala, deputy public safety
commissioner in American Samoa and executive director of a regional
law enforcement organization.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration has just one agent
responsible for the four Pacific jurisdictions _ American Samoa,
the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau and Guam. The agent is based in
Guam.
   ``There is a need for additional agents,'' the report said.
   American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands, a Caribbean
territory also cited in the report, are U.S. territories; the
Northern Marianas and Palau have compacts of free association with
the United States that include Interior Department assistance.
   ``Nobody knows how much'' drugs are smuggled through the
islands, said Larry L. Morgan, director of legislative and public
affairs for Interior's territorial and international affairs
branch. ``But from our perspective it's a serious problem.''
   DEA officials concurred the area was ripe for smuggling,
although one said he believed a significant dent was made late last
year in heroin traffic through Palau and Guam.
   A DEA spokesman, Ralph Lochridge, said the area was unlikely to
get additional DEA personnel soon because other areas, particularly
South America and Mexico, have been deemed higher priorities for
interdiction efforts.
   ``If you only have so many bodies, it's a matter of priorities _
you've got to get the most bang for your buck,'' said Lochridge,
who is based in Los Angeles, the office that supervises Guam.
``Obviously if we had more agents we'd increase our staffing
everywhere.''
   Aid for local drug enforcement in the four Pacific jurisdictions
was cut by nearly $1 million in the drug law passed by Congress in
1988.
   Sala, in a telephone interview, said the cutbacks forced island
governments to scale back their plans. ``When all of a sudden
things are cut you cannot expect miracles,'' he said.
   President Bush included the Interior Department's request to
restore the $1 million in his proposed fiscal 1991 budget.
   The report praised local governments for developing anti-drug
plans but said those efforts have been hurt by shortages in money,
equipment and people.
   Enforcement in the Virgin Islands is not as big a problem
because of DEA help from Puerto Rico and Miami, according to law
enforcement officials.
   The Bush administration's revised drug war strategy, issued last
month, made no direct reference to the use of the four island
nations for smuggling. But it said more broadly that the Pacific
Ocean ``is virtually unrestricted for maritime smuggling, and
relying on random patrols in such a vast body of water is
inefficient and ineffective.''
   Because of that, the report said, interdiction depends heavily
on intelligence and inspections of ships when they reach U.S. ports.
   The source of the U.S.-bound drugs entering Guam usually is
Asia, with Palau often serving as a stop before Guam, the report
said.
   ``This heroin has been found in some cases to be 60 percent
pure,'' it said.
   The report also said drug use is increasingly blamed for local
problems, particularly in the Virgin Islands.
   In those islands, identified as a transshipment point for South
American cocaine bound for the United States and elsewhere,
``widespread addiction to crack in numerous housing projects exists
and has led to increasing violence and crime. ... (The) number of
murders, many directly involving the sale and use of narcotics,
tripled last year.''
