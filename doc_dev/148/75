   Voters decide Tuesday whether to elect this
U.S. territory's first woman governor or re-elect a governor for
the first time ever.
   Republican Gov. Joseph Ada is running for re-election against
Democratic territorial Sen. Madeline Bordallo, widow of former Gov.
Ricardo J. Bordallo, who chained himself to a statue in a busy
Agana intersection and shot himself to death Jan. 30.
   Ricardo Bordallo was convicted of federal extortion charges and
was to have begun serving an 18-month prison sentence Jan. 31.
   Ada, 46, who defeated Ricardo Bordallo in 1986, held a 2-to-1
edge over Madeline Bordallo, according to a poll by the Pacific
Daily News.
   If he wins, Ada would be the western Pacific island's first
governor to be re-elected. Bordallo, 57, would be the territory's
first woman governor, and the first who is not a native Guamanian.
She is originally from Minnesota.
   Ada and Bordallo differ on few issues. Both advocate controlled
development, and back an appeal of the territory's restrictive
abortion law.
   Pro-choice advocates were urging voters to boycott the
gubernatorial election to protest the candidates' abortion stand.
