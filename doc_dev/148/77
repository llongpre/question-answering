   A Continental Airlines DC-10 made an
emergency landing after one of its engines caught fire, a passenger
said. There were no injuries.
   Flight 969, carrying 155 passengers on a flight from Guam to
Australia, returned to Guam about 20 minutes after its 5:25 a.m.
takeoff Tuesday, said Guy Schroeder, regional director for
Continental.
   Bernie Klupfel, a passenger aboard the plane, said he noticed a
fire in one of the plane's engines.
   Passengers aboard the flight were put up in hotels on Guam and
Saipan, the capital of the Northern Marianas Islands, said
Schroeder.
