   Former Gov. Richardo Bordallo was resentenced
Tuesday to four years in federal prison and fined $10,000 for
witness tampering and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
   Bordallo, who served as governor of this U.S. territory in the
Western Pacific from 1982 to 1986, was convicted in 1987 of 10
counts and sentenced to nine years in prison for allegedly
exchanging political favors for payoffs, but a federal appeals
court last year reversed eight of those counts and set aside the
sentence.
   Bordallo, who turned 62 on Monday, will pay his own way to the
U.S. mainland and report to the federal prison, once the Bureau of
Prisons has made an assignment, said Bordallo's attorney Howard
Trapp.
   Mike Cruz, of the federal probation office here, said
notification of where Bordallo is to report could come in as little
as two weeks.
   Bordallo, who met briefly with supporters outside the courtroom
but declined to talk to reporters, remains free on his own
recognizance.
   During his trial, federal proseuctors said Bordallo approved
government contracts and permits for various firms in exchange for
payments, mostly delivered to him in unmarked envelopes.
   The money was described by the donors as campaign contributions
or gifts, but never was reported by Bordallo in his campaign
statements, authorities said.
   He also was accused of approving a $103,000 government contract
for a company that agreed to hire his campaign manager.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said four bribery-realted
convictions were reversed because the federal crime of bribery
applies only to state officials and Guam is a territory.
   It said four extortion-related convictions were reversed because
the jury was not told it must find Bordallo demanded or otherwise
inducted the payoffs, totaling $79,600 in cash.
   The appeals court upheld the convictions of witness tampering
and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
   U.S. District Judge Cristobal Duenas resentenced Bordallo to
four years and fined him $5,000 on the witness tampering charge and
gave him a three-year suspended sentence on the conspiracy charge
and fined him $5,000.
   Bordallo, a Democrat elected in 1982, was indicted a few days
before the 1986 Democratic primary. He won the primary, but was
defeated in November 1986 by Republican Joseph Ada.
