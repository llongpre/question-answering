   Typhoon Andy, packing winds reaching 185 mph,
sent 1,100 people fleeing to shelters and forced the military to
ferry 17 airplanes to Hawaii as a precautionary measure,
authorities said.
   There were no reports of major structural damage or injuries
associated with the storm, according to police officer John
Thornton.
   As of this afternoon, the center of the typhoon with sustained
winds of 155 mph was located 113 miles east-southeast of Guam,
moving to the northeast at 10 mph, the Joint Typhoon Weather Center
said.
   The typhoon was expected to head into the Northern Mariana
Islands, bypassing Rota by 115 miles, before missing Tinian and the
capital city of Saipan by 155 miles, the center said.
   Guam, a U.S. territory with a population of 105,000, is the
largest of the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific.
   Earlier today, Guam was hit with 50 mph winds and gusts to 65
mph that knocked out 15 percent of the island's electric power for
a few hours.
   Thornton described the weather as ``not too bad.'' He said,
``You feel it in small cars when you're driving.''
   However, the island's banana and mango crops were hard hit, Guam
Cablevision reported.
   About half of the U.S. territory's schools were being used as
shelters, Thornton said.
