   Ricardo ``Ricky'' Bordallo, former governor
of Guam, died Wednesday of self-inflicted gunshot wounds while
draped in a Guam national flag and chained to a statue in a busy
intersection.
   Bordallo, pronounced dead at Naval Hospital 4:28 p.m., was to
have boarded a plane Wednesday night for Los Angeles. He was to
report to the federal correctional facility in Boron, Calif., on
Friday, where he was to begin serving a four-year prison term on
witness tampering and obstruction charges.
   Bordallo died of massive brain damage, said a hospital spokesman.
   Doctors had worked furiously to save his life, but emergency
surgery failed.
   Bordallo, 63, shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol after
chaining himself to a statue of Chief Quipuha at one of the capital
city's busiest intersections, said police Lt. Phil Dennis.
   He had unveiled four placards, one of which said, ``I regret
that I have only one life to give to my island,'' said Dennis. Also
recovered at the scene were a blood-stained flag and a padlock and
chain.
   Bordallo had served a governor of the U.S. territory from
1976-80, and was re-elected again in 1984.
   ``It's a very sad day for me personally ... he was a close
personal friend during the early part of our lives,'' said Ben
Blaz, Guam Republican congressional delegate, reached at his
Washington, D.C., office. ``I didn't think this would happen. Ricky
Bordallo always seemed to bounce back from his many adversities.''
   His wife, territorial senator Madeleine Bordallo, was said to
have been with her husband when he took his life.
