   Three fisherman were hungry, tired and
sunburned _ but otherwise no worse for wear _ when they were rescued
after drifting on the Pacific Ocean for six days, the Coast Guard
said.
   The Coast Guard cutter Cape George rescued the men, who are from
Agat, late Monday, about 100 miles west of Guam after spotting a
light blinking from their 16-foot aluminum boat, said cutter skipper
Lt. j.g. Daniel Christovich.
   One of the men, 36-year-old James Hubbard, said he and friends Ed
Alianza and Antonio Alforque, both 32, were anchored off Guam's
Facpi Point and planned to troll for a few hours on Nov. 16 when a
heavy rain and strong wind blew them out to sea. Facpi Point is on
Guam's southwest coast just south of Agat.
   ``The wind was taking us to the Philippines, there's no two ways
about it,'' he said.
   The trio waited until the rain subsided to try to get back to
shore, but by then they were two miles away and short on fuel, he
said. They tried to row, but a strong westward wind slowed them down.
   The men survived without water for three days and dumped most of
their fish overboard because they could not eat it without water to
wash it down, Hubbard said. On the fourth day, it rained and the men
rigged a water catchment, Hubbard said.
   ``We drank that stuff down like it was gold,'' he said.
