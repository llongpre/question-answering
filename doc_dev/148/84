   Tropical storm Ofelia intensified
into a typhoon today as it roared off toward Taiwan after pounding
the northern Philippines with wind and rain. At least 11 people
were killed, officials said.
   The Manila weather bureau announced this evening that Ofelia had
developed typhoon status, churning up winds of 75 mph.
   Ofelia had been expected to cross the northern tip of Luzon, the
main Philippine island. But officials said the storm veered
northward, skimming the east coast of Luzon's Cagayan province
before heading toward Batanes, the northernmost Philippine
province, about 400 miles north of Manila.
   It was the second big storm to strike the country this eyear.
   Storm warnings were raised over 13 Luzon provinces, and small
craft were warned to remain in port. Residents of the affected
provinces were warned to be alert for landslides and flooding.
   In Manila, heavy rains drenched the city throughout the night
and waves crashed over the seawall along Manila Bay. Schools were
closed today, and widespread areas of the city were without
electricity.
   In Guam, about 1,500 miles east of the Philippines, the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center reported that another tropical storm had
developed and was heading west-southwest in the general direction
of the Philippine island of Mindanao.
