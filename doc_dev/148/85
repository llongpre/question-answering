   Typhoon Ofelia battered China's eastern coast,
killing 10 people, capsizing more than 1,600 boats and destroying
thousands of homes, the official Xinhua News Agency said today.
   At least 47 people were killed when the typhoon earlier ripped
through the Philippines and Taiwan. Ofelia was the worst storm to
hit eastern Taiwan in 30 years.
   Another storm, Typhoon Percy, gained strength today as it headed
toward the Philippines.
   Typhoon Ofelia battered eight cities in China's Zhejiang
province on Sunday, killing 10 people and destroying 3,700 homes,
Xinhua said. The report said 1,696 boats were capsized and 50 miles
of levees were breached in the storm.
   Ofelia first struck the eastern coast of Luzon, the main
Philippine island, on Friday. Philippine officials said at least 30
residents were killed, and more than 84,000 were forced to flee
their homes because of flooding and landslides.
   The typhoon hit Taiwan later Friday, triggering mudslides and
leveling 200 homes in the eastern Taiwan province of Hualien.
Police said the death toll rose to 17 today, and 23 people were
reported missing.
   In Manila, forecasters said Typhoon Percy, packing 115 mph
winds, was centered 335 miles east of the Philippine island of
Catanduanes.
   Percy was moving west-northwest at about 14 mph toward
Catanduanes and southeastern Luzon island, which were expected to
feel the effects of the storm late today, the weather bureau said.
   One child was killed when Percy swept by the Pacific island
cluster of Palau on Sunday, the Pacific Daily News of Guam reported.
   Earlier Sunday, the typhoon's winds battered Yap Island in the
neighboring Federated States of Micronesia, knocking down about 30
houses and damaging banana and coconut plantations, police said.
There were no reports of injuries on Yap.
