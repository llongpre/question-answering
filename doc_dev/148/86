   The USS White Plains is an aging but essential
support ship that serves as a floating grocery store for vessels
assigned to the Navy's 7th Fleet.
   The 581-foot food stores ship has been based at the Pacific
island of Guam since 1984 and was returning there Tuesday after a
deployment to the northern Arabian Sea in support of Persian Gulf
operations. It was attached to the aircraft carrier Constellation
and its battle group during the deployment.
   According to Navy records, the White Plains is more than 20
years old but there is no history of any past serious problems
aboard the vessel involving accidents or its machinery.
   The vessel, the fourth in the so-called Mars class of food
supply ships, carries the Navy designation AFS-4 and was
constructed by the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. of San Diego,
Calif. The ship's keel was laid down on Oct. 2, 1965; it was
launched on July 26, 1966, and then commissioned into active
service on Nov. 23, 1968.
   It has since undergone several major overhauls.
   The ship has spent its entire life plying the waters of the
Pacific and Indian Oceans, at various points calling San Francisco
and the Japanese ports of Sasebo and Yokosuka home in addition to
Guam.
   The White Plains joined the fleet in time for numerous and
lengthy deployments during the Vietnam War and earned seven battle
stars for its performance. Even after American troops were
withdrawn from Vietnam, the White Plains drew additional duty in
the South China Sea supporting warships that had been ordered to
retrieve underwater mines sown in North Vietnamese waters.
   The ship has participated in training exercises with a number of
foreign navies, includes those of South Korea and Australia, and
also served as a ``mercy ship'' following natural catastrophes.
   For example, it carried relief supplies to Guam and other
islands in the Mariana chain in 1976 after Typhoon Pamela. Later
that same year the ship drew another special mission, ordered
without notice to the Indian Ocean to support a carrier task force
monitoring a flare-up in hostilities between Kenya and Uganda.
