<LEADPARA>  Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will
investigate allegations by members of a Harlem National Guard unit that they
were placed into a combat situation in the Persian Gulf without proper
training and not treated with respect by regular army forces, Rep. Charles B.
Rangel says.;    "When you're fat and 40 and they throw you into combat, it
isn't fair," said Rangel, whose New York district includes the headquarters of
the National Guard's 369th Transport Battalion, also known as the Harlem Hell
Fighters.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "These guys are as old as I am -- well, stretching it some," said Rangel,
59, a Korean War veteran with a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.;    The
average age of Guard unit members is 43, and half of them are Vietnam
veterans. They complained shortly before the gulf ground war began that their
unit had been broken up, stripped of equipment and moved to the front without
proper training.;    "We have three strikes against us," said Spec. Ruben O.
McCann, a Bronx postal worker who is a unit member and a Vietnam veteran. "We
are the Guard, we are from New York and we are black.";  A NEWBORN KUWAITI
GETs; U.S. NEWSMAN'S NAMe; KUWAIT CITY -- As residents celebrated the end of
Iraqi occupation, Nura Dhubia, a new mother, raced through the crowds
Wednesday looking for the first American she could find.;    When she found
one, a correspondent for The New York Times, she asked his name. She listened
to the reply and then asked again.;    She repeated the name as best she could
and then said she had promised God that she would name her newborn son after
the first American she met during the liberation of her country.;    "My boy
will be named Chris Hedges Dhubia," she said.;  $10,000 BOUNTY OFFERED; FOR
SADDAM HUSSEIN'S EAR; AGANA, Guam -- A former Guam senator is offering $10,000
for the right ear of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.;    "This is for all the
grief he has caused the people of the world," Ben Ada said.;    The one who
delivers the ear will also get a week's stay at the hotel of his choice on
Guam.;    Ada, a funeral home owner, says he has asked the territorial medical
examiner to help him establish the authenticity of the ear.;    The offer is
open to anyone, including Iraqis, Ada said. "Hopefully, it will be one of our
boys who brings it home.";     IRAN, IRAQ ANNOUNCE PLAN; FOR PRISONER
EXCHANGE; NICOSIA, Cyprus -- While the number of Iraqi soldiers captured by
allied forces continues to climb, Baghdad will be sending home 76 Iranians
captured in its 1980-'88 war with Iran, Tehran said Wednesday.;    Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the Iranian
POWs would go home within 48 hours.;    Mohammad Ali Nazaran, an Iranian
official in charge of POW affairs, said that, in exchange, Iran will
repatriate 76 Iraqis captured in the war.;    Tehran says thousands of Iranian
prisoners are still held in Iraq. The International Committee of the Red Cross
has upheld Iran's claim but added that it had no figures on how many Iranians
are still imprisoned in Iraq.  </TEXT>
