   Willie Star, the roving ambassador from Nauru,
was found Tuesday on the U.S. territory of Guam and seemed puzzled
by the recent hullabaloo in the State Department over his supposed
disappearance.
   T.W. Star, known to his friends as Willie, is officially listed
as ambassador to the United States from Nauru, a tiny island
republic in the western Pacific, but hasn't been seen in Washington
since he presented his diplomatic credentials to President Carter
nine years ago.
   The State Department had been sending letters and diplomatic
cables for several weeks in an unsuccessful attempt to find Star _
rumored to be living in Australia or the Philippines _ to determine
whether he's interested in becoming dean of the diplomatic corps, a
ceremonial post traditionally held by the senior resident ambassador
in Washington.
   Finally, on Tuesday, an Associated Press reporter in Honolulu
located Star by telephone at the Pacific Star Hotel on Guam in the
western Pacific, where he said he has served as Nauru's consul
general for the past year.
   He sounded puzzled over the State Department's search for him.
   Asked if he is still the U.S. ambassador from Nauru, Star
replied: ``I don't think so. I don't know. I'll have to talk to my
government.'' Then he hung up.
   Larry Dunham of the State Department's diplomatic and consular
section laughed when informed of Star's whereabouts. As small
nations sometimes do, he said, Nauru had failed to follow the
customary practice of informing the State Department of a consular
appointment.
   ``This is unusual, but everything about this case has been
unusual,'' Dunham said.
   Ordinarily, he said, foreign governments inform the State
Department of consular appointments through their embassy in
Washington, but Nauru does not maintain an embassy here. Star's
wife, reached by telephone Tuesday in Guam, said her husband had
never lived in Washington.
   Star's presence on Guam apparently also went unnoticed because
the territory's affairs are administered by the Interior Department.
The State Department has no representative on Guam.
   Mrs. Star, speaking to a reporter in her husband's absence
Tuesday, said Star previously had served as Nauru's consul general
in Melbourne, Australia, and the Philippines capital of Manila
before he was moved to Guam about a year ago.
   The State Department's manhunt for Star began shortly after the
retirement last month of Sweden's popular ambassador, Wilhelm
Wachtmeister, who had been dean of the diplomatic corps for three
years.
   Under protocol rules, the honorary post goes to the foreign
ambassador with the most seniority in Washington, based on the date
the envoy's credentials were presented to the U.S. president.
   The dean, who receives no extra pay, represents other ambassadors
at ceremonial functions and in dealings with the host government
over diplomatic immunity, parking privileges and other collective
concerns.
   After Wachtmeister retired, the deanship passed to the next
eligible ambassador, Andrew Jacovides of Cyprus, who was promptly
summoned home for a foreign ministry job. Next in line was Turkey's
Sukru Elekdag, but he is retiring. Then the State Department turned
to Star, the ambassador from Nauru who had been doubling as consul
general in Melbourne.
   A letter was dispatched to Star via the U.S. Embassy in Canberra,
Australia, informing him of his opportunity to become dean of the
diplomatic corps provided he takes up residence in Washington.
   Star never responded. The embassy had no luck finding him.
   Stan Ifshin, a State Department desk officer for Pacific island
affairs, said that the department will await clarification from
Nauru about whether Star is still U.S. ambassador. ``I don't believe
he is,'' Ifshin said.
   If Star doesn't take the deanship, it probably will go to the
ambassador from Cape Verde, an island republic in the Atlantic off
the West African coast.
