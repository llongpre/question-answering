   The U.S. government changed course today and
said it would back Pacific islanders' call for a ban on driftnet
fishing in their waters and on the high seas.
   ``There is a signal change in U.S. policy,'' Thomas A. Reese III
told delegates to the South Pacific Conference in this U.S.
territory.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. delegation, headed by Reese, held off
endorsing a resolution to ban what one delegate called ``this
barbarous form of fishing which should be banned everywhere.''
   Reese, a deputy assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, said he needed to consult with the State
Department in Washington for what direction to take on the
resolution.
   South Pacific nations, the American West Coast and U.S.
territories in the Pacific, including Guam and American Samoa, have
opposed driftnet fishing by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
   Driftnetting has been called the ``wall of death'' because nylon
nets up to 30 miles long and 49 feet deep are used to catch tuna.
The nets trap everything, including seals, whales, sharks,
dolphins, turtles and birds.
   On Tuesday, the Japanese consul general to Guam, Masao Wada,
told the delegates that the driftnet issue should be addressed in a
scientific, practical and friendly manner and not through a
unilateral ban. He said Japan plans to reduce its number of fishing
vessels and also will send an enforcement vessel to the region.
   The South Pacific Conference is the governing body of the South
Pacific Commission, which provides socioeconomic programs to
underdeveloped, isolated Pacific island countries and territories.
   The United States, Australia, France, New Zealand and Great
Britain contribute financially to the commission and take part on
an equal basis with the smaller countries and territories at the
conference.
   In making its policy shift, the United States wanted the
resolution applied to only the smaller Pacific islands and to the
American West Coast states. Hawaii was not mentioned.
   But the delegates agreed to include Australia and New Zealand in
the area covered by the resolution at the request of those two
nations.
   Philippe Baude, permanent secretary to the South Pacific and
France's delegate, questioned whether the resolution might violate
international law. He said the commission has no legal jurisdiction
over the waters in the South Pacific.
   Pacific islands affected by the resolution include French
Polynesia, Guam, American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Federated States
of Micronesia, Fiji, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, the Northern
Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands,
Tonga, Pitcairn Islands and Vanuatu.
