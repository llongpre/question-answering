   Typhoon Russ damaged or destroyed more than
2,000 homes and injured 88 people in this U.S. territory in the
Western Pacific, but no one was killed, officials said.
   The storm, packing wind that gusted up to 150 mph, swept over
the island of 145,000 residents on Friday.
   Gov. Joseph Ada on Saturday sent a letter to President Bush,
requesting a disaster declaration to release federal funds to help
in the recovery.
   A disaster declaration from Bush is unlikely for several days,
said Bart Stinson, a Civil Defense spokesman. There was no
immediate estimate of total damage, he said.
   Electricity and water service had been restored to about 20
percent of Guam by Sunday morning, Stinson said. Telephone service,
however, remained intact because most of the cables are buried, he
said.
   Stinson said damage to Guam Community College, which is adjacent
to Guam University, was extensive.
   ``It looks more like a tornado hit it than a typhoon,'' he said.
   The wooden buildings were splintered and desks strewn around the
campus, where trees were twisted and not just blown down, he said.
   Ada said a preliminary survey by Federal Emergency Management
Agency teams found 341 homes destroyed, 460 with major damage and
1,210 with minor damage to the point they were uninhabitable.
   Hospitals reported treating 88 people, mostly for punctures,
cuts and scratches from wind-blown debris.
   The FEMA teams were already on Guam when Typhoon Russ hit. They
had come to coordinate recovery operations on islands in the
Federated States of Micronesia that were hit by Typhoon Owen three
weeks ago.
