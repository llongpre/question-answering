   An opponent of the most restrictive U.S.
abortion statute was arraigned in the law's first court test as
Gov. Joseph F. Ada today stood behind his signing of the
legislation.
   ``I still believe that a fetus is a human being. And, therefore,
as human beings, they have rights _ civil rights,'' Ada said.
   Ada signed the measure into law Monday. It was unanimously
passed March 8 by the U.S. territory's Legislature.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Less than 48 hours after Ada signed the bill, attorney Janet
Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project in New York, was arraigned in Superior
Court on a misdemeanor charge of solicitation to commit abortion.
   She pleaded innocent before Judge Peter C. Siguenza, who
released Benshoof on her own recognizance and said a trial date
would be scheduled April 2.
   She said she will continue to organize opponents of the law in
hopes of persuading voters to overturn the measure in a November
referendum.
   Benshoof, who traveled here in an unsuccessful attempt to talk
Ada out of signing the measure, called the law ``a sick statute''
and ``an invasion of the bedroom.''
   ``I can understand and appreciate that,'' Ada said of her
comments. ``People have opinions to make and I respect their
opinions. It's a democratic country we're in.''
   Before the Legislature approved the measure, Attorney General
Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson called it unconstitutional.
   Asked why he signed the legislation over such an objection, Ada
said: ``I have to make that decision myself ... And the only body
that actually resolves that issue is the court.''
   Barrett-Anderson said today law enforcement officials would not
enforce the section of the statute forbidding abortions until a
court ruling on its constitutionalilty.
   However, she said that if an abortion is performed and Guam's
law is upheld in court, the individuals involved will face criminal
charges if the statue of limitations of three years has yet to run
out.
   Barrett-Anderson said authorities would continue to enforce the
law's restriction on soliciting a woman to have an abortion.
   The law sets a referendum during the Nov. 6 general election for
residents of this Pacific Ocean island about 1,500 miles east of
the Philippines to decide whether to keep the law.
