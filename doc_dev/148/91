   Typhoon Ofelia slammed into eastern Taiwan
today with 86 mph winds and heavy rain, killing at least five
people after claiming 30 lives in the Philippines and forcing tens
of thousands to flee their homes.
   The storm cut a swath of destruction through the Philippines'
central Luzon island, then gained strength as it crossed the Luzon
Strait and struck Taiwan's eastern province of Hualien.
   Police in Hualien, 200 miles southeast of Taipei, said five
people were killed when they were swept away by floods in a
village. They said four people were reported missing in nearby
villages.
   Officials said the Panamanian-registered freighter Juliana broke
its mooring in the port of Hualien and ran aground. All 28 sailors
aboard were rescued but three of them sustained minor injuries,
they said.
   Forecasters said the typhoon was moving northward in Taiwan at
14 mph and was about 70 miles south of Taipei, the capital, at 7
p.m. today.
   All domestic flights were canceled in Taiwan as a precaution.
   In the Philippines, the Red Cross and other relief agencies said
at least 30 people died and at least 84,600 fled their homes as the
storm cut through Luzon island.
   The hardest hit province was La Union, about 150 miles northwest
of Manila, where at least 22 people drowned or were killed in
landslides.
   Forecaster Alan Mescallado said another tropical storm was
spotted about 430 miles south-southwest of Guam. It was heading
west-southwest in the general direction of the Philippine island of
Mindanao.
   But Mescallado said even if the second storm stays on track, it
would be at least another 24 hours before it reached the
Philippines.
