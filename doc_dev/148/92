   Populations of the Pacific islands under U.S.
jurisdiction are skyrocketing, but departures are holding down
growth in Puerto Rico, the Census Bureau reported Sunday.
   Leading in growth was the island of Guam, where net immigration
helped boost population sharply.
   Both military personnel and civilian workers from the
Philippines helped increase Guam's population, the report said.
   Between 1980 and 1987 the population of Guam jumped by 24,400,
or 23.1 percent, to 130,400, the Bureau said. Of the increase,
5,200 were immigrants.
   The Northern Mariana Islands were second in growth, increasing
21.1 percent to a total of 20,300 people last year. This increase
was largely from births, however.
   And American Samoa added 19 percent to its population to climb
to 38,400, also due to an increase in births.
   On the other side of the nation, the U.S. Virgin Islands had
population growth of 9.8 percent to a 1987 total of 106,100 people.
Natural increase overcame the departure of 4,400 people to keep
growth ahead of the U.S. national average of 7.4 percent.
   That was not the case, however, with Puerto Rico, where the
departure of 227,000 residents between 1980 and 1987 held the
islands's overall growth to just 3.0 percent during the period.
   Puerto Rico's total population was 3,292,000 last year, up
95,000 from the 1980 census.
