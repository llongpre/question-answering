   The nation's toughest state abortion law
will be tested in federal court this week in what could be the
first step on the road to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Only Guam's abortion law is more restrictive than
Pennsylvania's, which was scheduled to go before Senior U.S.
District Judge Daniel H. Huyett III today. One of the two laws is
expected to give the nation's highest court an opportunity to
reconsider the decision that legalized abortion, Roe vs. Wade.
   ``The significance of it is the race to the Supreme Court,''
said Kathryn Kolbert of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project. ``Whichever one gets there first
raises the question for the court to re-evaluate Roe.''
   In a hearing expected to last most of the week, Huyett will hear
arguments on whether legislation passed in 1988 and 1989 illegally
restricts the rights of pregnant women and their doctors to obtain
or to perform abortions.
   Contested provisions include those that require married women to
inform their husbands before they can obtain abortions and that
generally ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy.
   Other sections are similar to some the U.S. Supreme Court
declared unconstitutional in a 1986 Pennsylvania case. Those
provisions:
   _Obligate doctors to provide pregnant women with information
regarding fetal development and their rights to obtain child
support.
   _Require a 24-hour waiting period between a woman's visit to a
doctor and the performance of the abortion.
   _Make information available to the public from reports required
from places that perform abortions.
   Kolbert and other opponents say the law interferes with the
ability of doctors to follow accepted treatment and counseling
standards, invites uneven law enforcement and the harassment of
abortion clinics and staffers, forces families to make decisions
contrary to their moral judgments and imposes reproductive choices
on women but not on men.
   But Robert R. Gentzel, a spokesman for the state attorney
general's office, said the commonwealth believes that ``there are
indeed appropriate public policy reasons for all of the
provisions.''
   He also maintained that the restrictions are permissible under
existing Supreme Court rulings.
   The Pennsylvania law has been temporarily blocked by federal
court order, as has the law in Guam, a U.S. territory in the
Pacific.
   In the spring, the Guam Legislature banned all abortions except
when a woman's life is endangered and outlawed all abortion
referrals.
   The U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade outlawed
state regulation of abortions unless the regulations were clearly
to safeguard the woman's health.
   The Pennsylvania law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pennsylvania, Women's Suburban Clinic, Women's
Health Services Inc., Reproductive Health and Counseling Center,
Allentown Women's Center and Dr. Thomas Allen of Allentown on
behalf of all Pennsylvania physicians who perform or make referrals
for abortions.
   Defendants in the suit are Gov. Robert P. Casey, state Secretary
of Health N. Mark Richards and state Attorney General Ernie Preate.
   Since 1980, when 65,777 abortions were performed in the state,
the number has declined every year, according to court documents.
   In 1988, 50,786 abortions were performed.
