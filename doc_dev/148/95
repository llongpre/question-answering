   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DEATH APPEAL
   
   The court, ruling in the case of an Arkansas mass murderer,
allowed states to execute convicted murderers even if no appeals
court reviews the validity of their convictions or death sentences.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices threw out an appeal filed for _ but
not by _ R. Gene Simmons, sentenced to death for killing 16
relatives and acquaintances in 1987.
   The court said such an appeal cannot be filed by a fellow death
row inmate.
   The case is Whitmore vs. Arkansas, 88-7146.
   
   REAR WINDOW
   
   The court said, in a ruling that could affect millions of
dollars in movie industry profits, that distributors of the Alfred
Hitchcock thriller ``Rear Window'' must share with a literary agent
earnings from the film's re-release.
   The 6-3 ruling was a defeat for actor Jimmy Stewart and
Hitchcock's heirs. Some film producers claimed it could limit
availability of movie classics.
   The case is Stewart vs. Abend, 88-2102.
   
   GUAM
   
   The court ruled that the U.S. territory of Guam and its
officials may not be sued for allegedly violating a much-used
federal civil rights law.
   The justices, by a 6-2 vote, threw out part of a lawsuit filed
by six Guam residents who said police punched, kicked and
threatened them to get them to confess to drug-related crime.
   The law allows those who prove government actions or policies
violated their constitutional rights to collect monetary damages.
   The case is Ngiraingas vs. Sanchez, 88-1281.
