   Wives of crew members of the USS White Plains
gathered at a naval station chapel Tuesday night to await word of
their husbands.
   Six men were killed and five injured when fire broke out aboard
the Navy supply ship in the South China Sea. The 581-foot vessel,
with a crew of 403 enlisted men and 25 officers, has been based on
this Pacific island since 1984.
   Some of the wives were inside the chapel, quietly making
telephone calls. Some sat in the ``crying rooms,'' where babies can
be taken during church services. Others waited outside in their
cars.
   The ship's ombudsman, the liaison between the ship and the wives
on shore, was inside the chapel office, meeting with wives and the
chapel staff.
   Those approaching the chapel who were not wives of White Plains
crewmen were turned away.
   A few of the wives arrived at Guam International Airport after a
weekend visit with their husbands in Hong Kong, where the ship had
made a port call. They did not know about the incident when their
plane landed.
   The White Plains was due to return to Guam this month from a
cruise that began Dec. 27 and also took it to Singapore and
Australia. The White Plains is one of four ships based on Guam.
   Eighty of the White Plains crewmen are married with families
living on Guam, Lt. Robert Crossan, the ship's chaplain, said in
December.
   Tuesday's fire comes three weeks after an explosion in a gun
turret on the battleship USS Iowa killed 47 sailors during an
exercise near Puerto Rico.
