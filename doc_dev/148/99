   Vandals painted pro-choice graffiti on a
Roman Catholic church, a state agency building and the Capitol,
where legislators approved what could become the nation's toughest
state anti-abortion law.
   ``Louisiana Legislature Hates Women,'' ``Women Fight Back'' and
``Women Will Decide Their Fate'' were among the slogans marring the
walls of the art deco-style Capitol, the nearby offices of the
Department of Transportation offices and St. Joseph's Cathedral.
   Shocked tour guides and visitors early Saturday discovered the
vandalism, which was carried out overnight. Police said they had no
suspects.
   ``I nearly cried,'' one guide said after seeing the Capitol.
``I'm very attached to this building.''
   Church workers painted over the grafitti at St. Joseph's, the
seat of Baton Rouge's Catholic diocese. Officials said workers
would begin scrubbing the paint off the state buildings Sunday.
   The damage was the latest protest in Louisiana's abortion
battle, which has drawn thousands of people on both sides of the
issue to the Capitol for demonstrations.
   The measure approved July 8 by the Legislature would prohibit
abortion except for pregnancies caused by rape or incest or to save
the life of the mother. Abortionists would face fines of up to
$100,000 and 10 years at hard labor.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer has said he has problems with some of the
bill's provisions and will not sign it. If he does not veto it,
however, it would become law Sept. 7.
   Days before that bill was approved, state lawmakers had sent
Roemer even tougher legislation without exceptions for pregnancies
caused by rape or incest. The governor, who had demanded those
exceptions, vetoed that measure.
   The current bill was rushed through both houses of the
Legislature the day before the session ended after anti-abortion
lawmakers failed to override the veto.
   Abortion opponents want to use the law to challenge the 1973 Roe
vs. Wade ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court defining a woman's right
to abortion.
   Only the U.S. territory of Guam would have a stronger
anti-abortion measure. The Guam law, which was passed in March,
only allows abortion to save the life of the woman and would
penalize both the woman and the abortionist.
