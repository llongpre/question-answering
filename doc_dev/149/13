<LEADPARA>  For most people, nightmares end with the dawn. For Bill Gates, the
hard-driving chairman of Microsoft Corp., who is known to keep pictures of his
opponents in his office, they linger during the day as well.;    In a "state
of the company" memo written for his top staff, Gates said some of his worst
fears for his billion-dollar software company -- normally seen as being on top
of the world -- are coming true.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Our nightmare -- IBM 'attacking' us in system software, Novell 'defeating'
us in networking and more agile, customer-oriented applications competitors
getting their Windows act together -- is a reality," Gates wrote.;    But
plucky in the face of those threats, Gates said Microsoft has a simple
response to its competition -- the Windows software control program that has
been a runaway success since its introduction last year.;    "Just as DEC's
strategy for the '80s was VAX, our strategy for the '90s is Windows -- one
evolving architecture, a couple of implementations. Everything we do should
focus on making Windows more successful," he wrote.;    The memo, issued last
month and obtained by the Mercury News, shows Gates not as the arrogant
multibillionaire of legend but instead as a CEO whose mind never strays far
from threats to the Redmond, Wash., company he co-founded.;    His attention
runs to questions of long-term importance, such as the need to work with
Japanese companies on software for digital consumer electronics. But he's also
well-versed in industry minutiae, such as passing along rumors that Scotts
Valley-based Borland International Inc. will include a word-processing program
in the upcoming Windows version of its Quattro Pro spreadsheet.;    At the top
of Gates' list of problems are two legal disputes the company is involved in
-- a copyright suit brought by Apple Computer Inc., which has so far gone well
for Microsoft, and a Federal Trade Commission antitrust inquiry.;    "If the
judge (in the Apple case) rules against us without making it clear what we
have to change or asks us to eliminate something fundamental to all windowing
systems (like overlapping windows), it would be disastrous," he wrote.;    He
also wrote, "Certainly I take the FTC inquiry seriously, and I am sure it will
use up even more executive staff time than the Apple lawsuit has. However, I
know we don't get unfair advantages. I hope we can quickly educate the FTC on
our business.";    There was some blunt language reserved for International
Business Machines Corp., with whom Microsoft has had a well-publicized dispute
about future computer operating systems.;    While working with IBM has forced
Microsoft to accept "poor code, poor design and other overhead," Gates wrote
that Microsoft "will not attack IBM as a company, and even our public
'attacks' on (IBM's) OS/2 will be very professional.;    "Eventually we need
to have at least a neutral relationship with IBM. For the next 24 months, it
may be fairly cold. We can emerge as a better and stronger company where
people won't just say we are the standard because IBM chose us.";    But he
admitted that Microsoft's greatest risk will be if IBM uses its connections at
Fortune 500 companies to freeze it out.;    Gates also conceded that Microsoft
has had a difficult time in making good on its promise of catching up to
Novell Inc., the industry's leading networking software company.;    "We knew
it wasn't going to be easy, but it has been even harder than we expected to
build a position in networking. You will see us backing off on some of our
spending level, but don't doubt that we are totally committed to the
business.";    In other portions of the memo, Gates admitted Microsoft's
customer support record was bad. "The number of customers who get a bad
impression because of this must be in the millions worldwide.";   
Microsoft-watchers who were shown the memo said it again revealed him to be on
top of all aspects of his business.;    "A lot of CEOs at successful companies
have a sense of complacency," said Dataquest's Marshall Mosely. "But Gates has
a healthy respect for that which can harm him. I think that's commendable."  </TEXT>
