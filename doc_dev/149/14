<LEADPARA>  Microsoft Corp. has rented a yacht and hired the Dave Brubeck quartet to
announce a new version of the world's most widely used computer software.;   
Microsoft says the rollout Tuesday will be the biggest launch of a new
software product in computer industry history.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MICROSOFT PLANS SPLASHY LAUNCH FOR DOS 5.0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The new product is an update of MS-DOS, the base layer of software used on
an estimated 60 million IBM-type personal computers worldwide. It provides
enhanced features compared with older versions of DOS, including more
available memory and a new "help" feature.;    The new DOS also moves the
software closer in appearance and features to Windows, a Microsoft product
that makes IBM-type computers easier to use. Windows has been a runaway
success since Microsoft introduced an improved version a year ago.;    DOS is
a type of software called an operating system, which controls a computer's
internal functions. On top of it, a computer user runs application programs
such as spreadsheets and word-processing programs.;    To emphasize the
importance Microsoft places on the new product, called DOS 5.0, Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates has rented the dinner-cruise yacht New Yorker for a news
conference in the Hudson River. Dining and dancing to the music of Dave
Brubeck is included.;    An extensive advertising and marketing campaign will
follow.;    Microsoft, the largest software maker, hopes its splashy launch of
DOS 5.0 will help it overcome the disappointing sales of the last major DOS
update. DOS 4.0, announced three years ago, failed to take off -- partly
because it was riddled with bugs -- and most owners of IBM-type computers
continue to use earlier DOS versions.;    To avoid similar quality problems
with DOS 5.0, Microsoft conducted what it called the most extensive testing
program in personal computer software history. About 7,000 users were given
advance copies to find bugs and make suggestions.;    "We learned from our
mistakes," said Brad Chase, the DOS 5.0 product manager.;    Another problem
with DOS 4.0 was that it actually took up more computer memory space than
previous versions. DOS 5.0 gives computer users more memory than all earlier
DOS versions so programs run better.;    Microsoft says it will make DOS 5.0
available to personal computer makers and, for the first time in a DOS
upgrade, directly to existing personal computer owners. Previous DOS upgrades
were available to personal computer owners only through the computer makers
themselves.;    Microsoft says it will sell a $99.95 kit to upgrade earlier
versions of DOS to DOS 5.0 through about 7,000 computer stores. In addition,
130 personal computer makers worldwide have licensed DOS 5.0 for use in new
computers.;    Industry analyst Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. said
she believes DOS 5.0 will be a hit.;    "I think it's an important upgrade.
Microsoft is going to market it aggressively," she said. "The feedback (from
testers) has been very strong.";    She said Microsoft could sell about 8
million upgrade kits for DOS 5.0. She estimated Microsoft would make about $30
profit on each, or a total of $240 million.;    Microsoft, based in Redmond,
Wash., earned $279.2 million on revenue of $1.18 billion in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1990.;    In addition to providing more memory and "help" text
that pops up in boxes on the computer screen, DOS 5.0 reconfigures the way the
screen looks to make it more user-friendly.;    DOS 5.0 borrows some of its
screen appearance from Windows, a program that is layered on top of DOS,
replacing DOS' arcane typed commands with graphical symbols (icons) and a
hand-held control device (a mouse) like those of Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintosh line of personal computers.;    But despite DOS 5.0's ease-of-use
features, Chase said Microsoft doesn't believe it will compete with Windows.; 
  Chase said he believes corporations will install DOS 5.0 on older personal
computers that cannot use Windows to prepare employees for the conversion to
Windows-equipped personal computers.  </TEXT>
