   William Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., became the personal computer industry's first billion-dollar man yesterday. 

   The 31-year-old Harvard University dropout holds 11,018,955 shares, or about a 42% stake in Microsoft, which supplies, among other things, the internal program that controls the basic functions of International Business Machines Inc.'s PC line of personal computers and compatible machines. 

   The magic number for the billion-dollar mark for Mr. Gates's stake was a share price of $90.75, and the stock rose above and dipped below that level during the day. 
Microsoft finally closed at $91.25, up $1.75, in national over-the-counter trading, which brought the value of his stake to $1,005,479,643.75. 

   Mr. Gates, who was traveling in South America, wasn't available for comment on his new distinction. 
In recent months, colleagues and competitors had begun to jokingly refer to Mr. Gates as "Billion Dollar Bill" as the paper value of his fortune swelled. 

   Mr. Gates is the biggest beneficiary of an astonishing run-up in the price of Microsoft shares. 
The shares, which first were offered to the public a little more than a year ago for $21 each, have been outpacing the booming stock markets in recent months, and have nearly doubled in value since the end of the year. 

   "Is there a premium in the stock price because of Bill Gates?" asked Richard Sherlund, an analyst who follows the company for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 
"I'd have to say yes, because he is considered one of the brightest people in the industry." 
Mr. Sherlund also said Microsoft's role "at the focal point of the personal computer industry" -- supplying operating system software to both IBM and other manufacturers -- has driven market enthusiasm for the stock. 

   Not even the founders of Apple Computer Inc., Steven P. Jobs and Steve Wozniak, came close to building billion-dollar fortunes in personal computers, even though they practically fathered that industry. 

   In high-technology businesses, only H. Ross Perot, who founded Electronic Data Systems Corp., now the data-processing services division of General Motors Corp., and David Packard and William Hewlett, founders of computer and scientific instrument maker Hewlett-Packard Co., have the distinction of building personal fortunes estimated to exceed $1 billion.
