<DESCRIPT>  JUDGE; ELECTRONICS; COMPUTER; ABUSE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  A Seattle judge has agreed that billionaire Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has
been the victim of harassment. Gates has been bothered via the tool that made
him famous: the computer. In what may be one of the first cases of high-tech
harassment, a former Microsoft saleswoman Monday was ordered to stay away from
Microsoft -- and Gates -- both physically and electronically. Microsoft said
Joan Brewer had been sending Gates a steady stream of unwelcome messages over
an electronic mail system. Brewer earlier had claimed that she -- not Gates --
was the victim of harassment, though the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission dismissed her complaint. Now, King County District Judge William
Roarty has told Brewer any contact she makes with Microsoft must be through
the company's legal department.  </LEADPARA>
