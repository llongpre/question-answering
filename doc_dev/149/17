   More than 5,000 hunters met Friday's
deadline to apply for just 235 licenses in Florida's first
alligator hunt in 25 years. The lucky winners won't be allowed to
use guns.
   Once an endangered species, the American alligator now numbers
about 1 million in Florida and is increasingly encountering humans
as the state's people population also grows.
   A 4-year-old girl was killed by an alligator in May near her
family's lakeside home in Englewood, in southwest Florida, but
planning for the hunt had been under way long before that.
   The Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission gave final approval
Friday, during a meeting in Ocala, for the trapping and killing of
up to 3,425 alligators in 20 wildlife management areas during the
30-day hunt this fall. That quote assumes that not every hunter
will get his full 15-animal limit.
   Commission spokesman Scott Ball said 15,000 applications were
printed and he was surprised that only 5,000 people applied.
   ``A lot of people have been calling up in the last few days that
have been procrastinating and kicking themselves for waiting until
the last minute,'' said Ball. ``They are asking about next year.''
   The sanctioned hunts will occur only at night and trappers will
have to use snares, harpoons, spears or similar weapons to get a
gator close enough to kill. The only firearm allowed will be a
``bangstick,'' a pole with a shotgun shell on the end that is used
to kill a gator once it is snared and brought up to a boat, said
Ball.
   Part of the motivation for hunting gators may be economic. Gator
meat sells for about $5 a pound; hide sells for about $40 a foot.
   Florida residents selected by lottery for the hunt will have to
pay a $250 license fee, plus a $30 tag fee for each gator they
catch up. Out-of-state hunters will have to pay $1,000 for the
licenses.
   In addition to the license fees and tag fees, those awarded
licenses will have to go through a six-hour training course in
early August, said Ball.
   The targeted reptiles will have to be at least 4 feet long.
   The tag fee is to pay for inspection and verification that hides
being prepared for market are legal.
   ``It's tightly regulated so that only legal hides will be
brought to marketplace,'' said Ball. ``There are only a few
processors of hides. We keep an eye on them.''
   Since the mid-1960s, alligator hunting virtually has been banned
except for isolated experimental hunts since 1982 and the removal
of nuisance alligators in populated areas.
