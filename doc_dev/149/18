<LEADPARA>  Candor has its price, and for Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates, it's
apparently $320 million.;    That was the amount that Gates' "paper fortune"
shrank Wednesday as the result of a 7 percent decline in Microsoft's stock
blamed on Wall Street reaction to Gates' memo on the numerous challenges
facing his company.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PAPER LOSSES: GATES' MEMO COST HIM MILLIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Gates' six-page lament, originally intended for the Redmond, Wash.,
software supplier's senior staff but later leaked, told how Microsoft has
cultivated an opponent rather than an ally in IBM; how Microsoft has made no
inroads in the fast-growing networking marketplace; and how it stands to lose
sales to leaner competitors, such as Borland International Inc. of Scotts
Valley.;    Gates, who has a reputation as a competitor-obsessed worrier, ends
the memo on an upbeat note by trumpeting his strategy to make the Windows
control program an even bigger success. But Microsoft shares nonetheless fell
$8.13 to close at $103.38 in trading that was more than double normal levels.
At midday today, Microsoft was down to $100.;    Gates owns about a third of
the 115 million outstanding shares of Microsoft stock.;    Previously trading
at about 30 times earnings, Microsoft has long been one of Wall Street's
pricier stocks. Analysts said that by concentrating in a single document so
much bad news about Microsoft, the memo brought to the surface a lingering
investor concern that Microsoft might be overvalued.;    "The market is
pricing a new risk into the Microsoft story," said David Readerman, analyst at
Shearson Lehman in San Francisco.;    Despite the dramatic drop in the stock
price, Gates -- who was traveling in Europe on Wednesday -- should not
despair, as there is life after a self-critical memo.;    Ask Autodesk Inc.,
the Sausalito design software company whose stock is close to its 52-week high
despite a blistering 44-page memo by founder John Walker released 2 1/2 months
ago -- a document Gates cited as inspiration for his own.;    Walker called
his memo "The Final Days" and compared Autodesk to NASA before the explosion
of the space shuttle.;    "I am deeply concerned about the future of the
company," Walker wrote. "Autodesk possesses all the prerequisites to lead the
next generation of the PC industry, yet it seems to have become stuck in the
past, mired in bureaucracy, paralyzed by unwarranted caution and to have lost
the edge of rapid and responsive product development and aggressive marketing
and promotion on which the success of Autocad (its key product) was founded.";
   Walker, who retired from formal management tasks at the firm three years
ago but who still owns 4 percent of its stock, went on to make a number of
specific recommendations for the company, some of which have been implemented.
Others will be enacted in a reorganization planned for July 1, a spokesman
said.;    Walker's memo is in a long tradition of public self-criticism at
Autodesk; it was given out freely to the firm's 1,100 employees, and a dozen
previous efforts have been published in a book.;    Discussing the chance of a
memo being given to a competitor or reporter, the memo called such risks
"unavoidable consequences of placing the issues on Autodesk's agenda."  </TEXT>
