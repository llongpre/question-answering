mixed signals about its future prospects

For Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, these are trying times. His company is
under scrutiny for alleged anti-trust violations; Wall Street has soured on
the stock; and after 18 years of spectacular growth Microsoft is planning
for a 'bumpy' year ahead. Could Microsoft have lost the golden touch that
has enabled it to become the largest software company in the world, made
Gates, 37, the richest man in the US and created hundreds of millionaires
among its employees?
This is the sort of question that irritates Gates. From his perspective,
Microsoft's achievements to date have nothing to do with a Midas charm,
rather they reflect hard work and perseverance, long-term vision and
commitment.
He has no patience with 'simplistic analysis' that assumes Microsoft will
inevitably be successful in anything the company turns its hand to. Or, as
is now the case, that short-term expectations for slower growth may signal
that Microsoft's glory days are coming to a close.
Indeed, predicting the outlook for Microsoft is complicated by numerous
issues. Not the least of these is whether Microsoft will face an anti-trust
suit. The US Justice Department is currently reviewing documents from a
three-and-a-half year investigation conducted by the US Federal Trade
Commission.
Other problems for Microsoft include a downward trend in software prices and
a weak market environment in Europe, one of its largest markets. With no big
operating system software product introductions planned for the next 12
months, Microsoft also faces an unusual dry spell. Revenues from the
company's core business - software for office PCs - may grow less rapidly
than in the past.
Yet the company is driving ahead with ambitious plans to enter new markets
such as programs for hand-held 'personal digital assistants,' software for
children, multimedia products and software for the 'digital highways' of the
future.
Microsoft is also developing two new generations of personal computer
operating systems; one for desktop PCs, codenamed Chicago, and a second,
called Cairo, for computer networks (see below).
But torn between blowing Microsoft's trumpet, to impress customers and
investors, or highlighting its vulnerabilities, to appease Washington
regulators, Gates and other Microsoft executives are delivering a mixed
message about the company's future prospects.
'In looking at this industry and Microsoft's role in it, I am very
optimistic,' Gates says. 'We are investing in a very optimistic way.'
In the next breath, however, he is urging caution. 'A number of these
investments may take a long time to pay off,' he says. 'If these new things
kick in, then we will go back to higher growth. If we're wrong, then we
won't ever advance beyond the level we are at today.'
Microsoft's propensity to point out the risks associated with entering new
markets, and that even its new PC software products could 'bomb', has
contributed to Wall Street's uncertainties.
'That tone of conservatism is part of our culture. We expect good results,
but prefer them to come as surprises,' Gates says. Yet veteran Microsoft
watchers believe that the company's recent emphasis on potential problems is
at least in part aimed at the ears of anti-trust regulators in Washington
DC.
For example, Microsoft is at pains to point out that it does have
competitors. Executives even highlighted rival products in a presentation to
financial analysts less than two weeks ago. And in an attempt to win
political support, Gates reels off the benefits which the PC industry has
provided to the US economy, such as growth in exports and the creation of
jobs.
'Today's software business is thriving, and it is not just Microsoft,' says
Gates. 'There are 750 software companies in the state of Washington alone
and the majority of them write software (applications programs) for
Microsoft Windows. Net employment went up by more than the size of Microsoft
just in the last year. . .the incredible thing is how well the US has done
in this business.' The Clinton administration would be foolish to do
anything that threatened the future of Microsoft, Gates seems to be
implying.
Politics aside, the greatest challenges facing Microsoft lie in the
development of a series of ground-breaking technologies. Gates is placing a
big bet on software for 'digital highways' - which could deliver multimedia
information services to millions of businesses and homes.
His goal is to establish a software standard for the way people use
information services, whether they be entertainment services on interactive
television, public information services at a kiosk in a shopping centre or
business information services in the office.
Partnerships - with cable television companies, telephone companies and
companies in the entertainment field - will be an important aspect of
Microsoft's involvement in digital highways. While denying reports that
Microsoft has already struck a deal, Gates acknowledges that Microsoft is
talking to US West as well as other US telephone companies, and TCI and Time
Warner, the two largest US cable television companies. The gold rush
surrounding 'digital convergence' also has movie moguls, newspaper
companies, AT&amp;T and IBM knocking on his door, Gates says.
'You will see us enter into all sorts of partnerships.' Some will merely be
agreements to collaborate in trials of interactive television service.
Others may be 'hard-core joint ventures'. Microsoft also plans to make
minority equity investments in companies involved in digital highways.
'I am not aware of any other company that is making the kind of bet that we
are on digital information highways,' Gates says. The company will spend
'many tens of millions of dollars' developing the technology, and 'won't get
any revenue for at least three years. And it could all be wasted, but that
is the name of the game'.
The 'game' of spotting new technology directions and turning them into
business opportunities is one at which Gates is a master and with Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in cash resources, Microsoft can even afford to lose a
few rounds.
