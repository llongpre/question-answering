   John Sculley and Bill Gates, putting
aside for the moment the legal battle between Apple Computer Inc.
and Microsoft Corp., dined peacefully together this week and
announced an ``office on a disc'' for the Apple Macintosh.
   Gates, chairman of Microsoft, quipped that ``the legal
departments aren't friends.'' But he noted that the two companies
remain steadfast allies and share the same vision of the future of
computing.
   Sculley, Apple's chairman, said his appearance at the Microsoft
presentation on Tuesday ``shows that we want to be partners
together in innovation'' despite Apple's ongoing copyright suit
against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Apple and Microsoft are working together ``more now than at any
time in the past,'' Gates said. ``We have decided not to let (the
lawsuit) affect the other things we're doing and let it run its own
course.''
   Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., recently won a round in the
courtroom fight when a federal judge issued a tentative ruling that
would substantially narrow Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple's suit
accusing Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard of stealing the ``look and
feel'' of the Macintosh system.
   ``Microsoft has always been very clear that we don't understand
why Apple brought the lawsuit, and that we expect to win the
lawsuit,'' Gates said. ``I think the recent developments are
consistent with (our) predictions. The case is not over but it was
a very positive milestone.''
   The ``office on a disc'' for the Apple Macintosh consists of a
compact disc containing four of Microsoft's most popular business
programs for the Macintosh _ Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and
Mail _ plus documentation for each, a thesaurus and other items.
   Both companies hope the product will help spur the evolution
from floppy diskettes to compact disks for computers.
   The Microsoft Office collection on disk will be priced at $949
and is expected to be available by the end of September. That is a
one-third discount from what the programs would cost if bought
separately on floppy diskettes.
   Sales of Apple's compact disc drive, which retails for about
$1,200, have been slow so far as businesses await more software for
it.
   ``This is just an introductory technology. I don't expect it to
have a major financial impact,'' said analyst David Bayer of
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ``It's more a demonstration
of capabilities, laying the groundwork for future uses.''
