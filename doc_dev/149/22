<LEADPARA>  1975: A small New Mexico company offers a $400 kit, the Altair 8800, giving
birth to the personal computer business. The Altair is programmed by switches
and lights on its front panel. Consultant Gary Kildall can't sell Intel on the
idea so he starts Digital Research Inc. to sell the first successful
microcomputer operating system program, called CP/M. Bill Gates and partner
Paul Allen launch Microsoft Corp. by selling a version of the BASIC language
for the Altair.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  ...; 1977: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sell the first Apple II, kicking off
the personal computer age. In the same year, Commodore and Tandy introduce
their first personal computers.; ...; 1979: Two seminal software packages
appear. MicroPro's WordStar turns nearly every CP/M machine into a word
processor. More important is the release of VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet.
For the first time, business buyers see personal computers as something other
than toys.; ...; 1980: The Apple III is introduced and bombs. But dBASE II is
launched and stays the industry leader for the next 11 years.; ...; 1981:
Industry pundits fawn over the Osborne I, the first "portable" computer -- yet
the company folds in two years. The same pundits dismiss the IBM PC when it is
introduced Aug. 12, chuckling that a big mainframe company couldn't possibly
understand how to make a personal computer. Only Microsoft seems to
understand, scrambling to give IBM an operating system -- MS-DOS -- after a
Digital Research-IBM deal goes awry.; ...; 1982: People begin to realize what
IBM has done. Lotus introduces 1-2-3, a spreadsheet program that becomes an
overnight smash hit. One month later, Compaq unleashes the first IBM PC clone,
and the market explodes.; ...; 1983: Two of the industry's biggest disasters
occur. With incredible fanfare, Apple launches the Lisa in January, with a
radical user interface -- and at $10,000 a price to match. In November, after
months of speculation and leaks, IBM takes a stab at the home market with the
PCjr, with a keyboard whose keys look and feel like Chiclets gum.; ...; 1984:
Apple takes another crack at the user interface, introducing the Macintosh to
a cheering crowd -- mainly employees -- on Jan. 24. In August, IBM introduces
the PC AT, its first success since the original PC.; ...; 1985: Apple and IBM
admit their mistakes: The Lisa and the PCjr are killed in the same month.
Commodore, meanwhile, jumps back in the fray with the Amiga, which despite
good reviews never catches on with the public.; ...; 1986: Compaq introduces
the Deskpro 386, the first machine to use the now-standard Intel 80386
processor. Microsoft goes public, and Bill Gates' decision to back IBM pays
off when he soon becomes the industry's first billionaire.; ...; 1987: With
older technology playing out, Apple and IBM try something new. The Macintosh
II now has what the Apple II had for years: a color screen and expansion
slots. IBM, desperate to ward off the clones it made possible, introduces the
PS/2 with a new -- and proprietary -- kind of expansion slot and a promised
new operating system, OS/2.; ...; 1988: Apple sues Microsoft and
Hewlett-Packard for copyright infringement, ushering in the era of
look-and-feel litigation. Meanwhile, ex-Apple chief Steve Jobs finally shows
what's Next: a black cube that captures the media's attention and not much
else.; ...; 1989: The year of the portable sees the introduction of, among
other things, the first pen computer (the GridPad), and two computers that fit
into (large) pockets (the Poqet and Atari Portfolio).; ...; 1990: Seven years
after the first version is announced, Microsoft Windows finally is embraced by
buyers. Within a year, Windows 3.0 will sell more than 3 million copies. Seven
years after the PCjr disaster, IBM introduces the PS/1, hoping to reignite the
home computer market. Other entrants: Tandy and Apple, which introduces the
first Macintosh for less than $1,000.; ...; 1991: Everything you know is
wrong. IBM's romance with Microsoft sours, and a most unlikely new one
blossoms in a joint venture with archrival Apple. Industry consolidation
begins in earnest, with Borland buying dBASE creator Ashton-Tate and network
king Novell swallowing up Digital Research.  </TEXT>
