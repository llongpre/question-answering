<LEADPARA>  What began as a small federal inquiry into a single deal by Microsoft Corp.
has mushroomed into a full-scale investigation of virtually all the business
practices of the Redmond, Wash., firm, the software industry's most powerful
company.;    The vastly expanded Federal Trade Commission probe of Microsoft
-- which the company acknowledged Friday in a news release -- could have
profound effects throughout the computer industry.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Microsoft last month announced it was the subject of a narrow FTC
investigation. It said then that the commission was examining a 1989 news
release it issued jointly with International Business Machines Corp.
describing plans for future versions of a computer operating system.;    On
Friday, though, Microsoft said it had been formally notified by the FTC that
the commission is tackling a much larger question: allegations by other
software companies that it "has monopolized or has attempted to monopolize the
market for operating systems, operating environments, computer software and
computer peripherals" -- in other words, its entire product line.;    IBM is
not believed to be a subject of the investigation.;    Microsoft maintains it
has done nothing wrong and said the personal computer industry teems with
competition.;    "Microsoft is surprised and disappointed that the inquiry has
been broadened," said William H. Neukom, vice president of law and corporate
affairs. "We will continue to cooperate with this investigation. We believe
that Microsoft has acted in a legal and ethical manner.";    The news of the
expansion of the FTC probe did only minimal harm to Microsoft's soaring stock,
which has made Chairman Bill Gates a multibillionaire and one of the nation's
wealthiest men. The stock fell $3.75 a share to $107.25 in Over-the-Counter
trading.;    Microsoft has a near-monopoly on operating systems for IBM
personal computers, is a leading supplier of software for the Apple Macintosh,
and is moving aggressively in computing areas expected to boom in the next 10
years, such as powerful desk-top "work stations" and new computers that use
pens instead of keyboards.;    The FTC probe could lead to a change in
Microsoft's business practices. But it's also of grave concern to other
companies, because firms throughout the personal computer industry must build
some guess about Microsoft's actions into their own business plans.;    And
the mere existence of an expanded inquiry might have a chilling effect on
Microsoft, making it more timid and its rivals more bold.;    In recent years,
industry executives have complained with increasing anger -- though usually
only in private -- that Microsoft goes beyond being a heads-up competitor and
instead uses its dominant market position in a manner that is at least unfair
and possibly illegal.;    One industry executive questioned by the FTC, who
spoke on the condition that neither he nor his company be identified, said the
FTC began its probe last fall with a limited set of questions but greatly
expanded the investigation's scope after hearing one industry executive after
another bitterly complain about Microsoft's practices.;    About 15 software
companies are believed to have been questioned, and the executive said the
commission has a much longer list it now wants to pursue in this new stage of
its inquiries.;    "The FTC is surprisingly knowledgeable," he said. "They are
interested in the full context of Microsoft's impact on the industry.";    The
executive said that Wordperfect Corp., the Utah word-processing software
company, took a lead role in lodging complaints against Microsoft.;   
Microsoft sells Word, a word-processing program that competes against
Wordperfect's product. The executive said Microsoft uses its profits from its
operating system division to undercut companies like Wordperfect on the
applications side.;    Others have also complained about Microsoft's pricing
policies or about it once persuading software companies to spend tens of
millions of dollars developing products for one operating system, only to
switch to another at the last minute.;    Many companies are rankled by what
they see as Microsoft's arrogance.;    "Microsoft is like a 6-(foot)-4
17-year-old boy. It lacks the inhibitions of a mature adult," said Bob
Metcalfe, who founded 3Com Corp. and who later had a well-publicized
falling-out with Microsoft. "It's a billion-dollar company that has not
developed the inhibitions befitting a company of its size. It needs to be
taught a lesson, like IBM was taught in the '50s and '60s, that when you have
a huge monopoly, you have to behave differently.";    Any FTC action against
Microsoft might be years away; its probes are notoriously lengthy affairs. The
FTC will not discuss the investigation and certainly not what action, if any,
it may take.;    Federal antitrust laws are exceedingly complex but generally
bar companies from engaging in practices that lessen competition or harm
consumers.;    The FTC has only civil powers and can go to court to force a
company to change objectionable practices. Only the Justice Department, with
which the FTC works closely, can bring criminal charges.  </TEXT>
