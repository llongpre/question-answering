ACCIDENTAL EMPIRES by Robert X CringelyViking Pounds 16.99, 324 pages
ROBERT CRINGELY has heroes, villains and sweeping conclusions, appropriately
enough for the gossip columnist of a US trade magazine. Accidental Empires,
his idiosyncratic history of the US personal computer business, includes a
good measure of all three: it is subtitled How the boys of Silicon Valley
make their millions, battle foreign competition and still can't get a date.
His heroes are too honest for their own good. Mitchell Kapor, for example,
is founder of Lotus Development Corporation, and designer of 1-2-3, the
world's best-selling spreadsheet. A former disc jockey and transcendental
meditation teacher, the success of 1-2-3 left him fabulously wealthy and,
Cringely says, needlessly guilt-ridden: 'I think Mitch Kapor isn't happy
because he feels like an imposter . . . Imposters are people who feel they
haven't earned their success, haven't paid their dues - that it was all too
easy'.
Kapor spotted and exploited a unique opportunity. In the early 1980s he
believed that there would be a ready market for a good spreadsheet program
suitable for the newly launched IBM PC, and planned on selling Dollars 4m
worth of 1-2-3 in the first year. Sales in fact topped Dollars 53m (Pounds
30.9m) and Lotus grew to be one of the world's largest software houses.
Kapor found running a business less fun than starting one and left in 1986.
Cringely's villains start black and he paints them blacker. Bill Gates,
founder and chief executive of the US software company Microsoft, is his
principal target. Credited with a personal fortune of more than Dollars 7bn,
Gates is one of the richest people in the US but, most would agree, hard to
like. He is arrogant, charmless and possessed of an outsize business
aggression which has driven Microsoft to annual sales of more than Dollars
2.5bn but won him few friends on the way.
But this is merely the point at which Cringely begins to turn the knife. We
learn of Gates' scruffy personal habits, his meanness, his infantile
behaviour and so on and so forth. What did Gates ever do to Cringeley to
merit such treatment?
Here is his analysis of the origin of the personal computer business: 'The
game was started to satisfy the needs of disenfranchised nerds like Bill
Gates who didn't meet the macho standards of American maleness and so looked
for a way to create their own adolescent alternative to the adult world and,
through that creation, gain the admiration of their peers'.
Heroes and villains apart, Cringely's major conclusion is that US
manufacturers should forget the personal computer hardware business. Profit
margins are narrowing, other nations are catching up in the technology
stakes and the entrepreneurs and technical wizards who made the whole thing
happen are tiring of the struggle:
'Today, everyone who wants to be in the pc business is already in it . . .
The business is slowing down and this loss of energy is the greatest threat
to our computing future as a nation. Forget about the Japanese; their threat
is nothing compared to this loss of intellectual vigour,' Cringeley argues.
He believes the US should concentrate on the two remaining growth areas  -
microprocessors and software - where he thinks America still has a
technological lead. But his case is spoilt by the fact that much of this
book is filled with anecdotal evidence of amateurishness, greed and lack of
attention to quality which, he implies, permeates the US personal computer
industry.
The Japanese are already making startling progress in software. On this
evidence they will win hands-down on quality.
