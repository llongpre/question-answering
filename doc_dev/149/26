Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, is set to unveil
plans for the next generation of its hugely popular Windows personal
computer software in Atlanta, Georgia, next week.
Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, plans to demonstrate Windows 4.0 -
codenamed Chicago - to the public for the first time and detail plans for
its release.
Chicago is a big advance on the best-selling computer operating system
combination ever - Microsoft's MS-Dos and Windows software. Gates predicts
huge sales for Chicago next year. He hopes a 'significant proportion' of the
60m users of Windows will upgrade to the new software. In addition, most PC
manufacturers are expected to install the new version of Windows on PCs
shipped after the official launch. The date for that is yet to be fixed. But
the company expects the product to be available this year.
'Chicago will be the most popular systems (software) update we have ever put
out,' says Gates, who comments that he will be disappointed if Chicago does
not generate at least Dollars 500m in sales during its first year on the
market.
The Chicago upgrade package for existing Windows users is expected to sell
for between Dollars 50 and Dollars 100.
Microsoft suggests several reasons for PC users to buy the upgrade:
With the introduction of Chicago, Microsoft will merge its two top selling
products, MS-Dos and Windows, into a single PC operating system, providing a
better way to harness the power of the latest, high-speed PC
microprocessors.
Chicago, it claims, will also make PCs much easier to use than either Apple
Computer's Macintosh or PCs running existing versions of Windows.
The new program will make it easier to hook PCs up to a network.
Extensive testing of Chicago indicated to Microsoft that Windows users were
often befuddled by crowded, confusing screens and inconsistent commands. So
Chicago will look quite different from the existing Windows product. For
example, Microsoft found that the Windows Program Manager, File Manager,
Windows Setup and Control Panel systems were often confusing to users who
did not know where to start when they needed to make changes to the system,
by adding hardware or software. These elements have been made simpler and
more consistent in Chicago, so that adding a new printer or changing the
resolution on screen is much easier.
Microsoft has also made major improvements to the basic applications
incorporated in Windows, including word-processing, communications and
personal information management programs.
Yet despite these new elements, Microsoft faces some significant challenges
if Chicago is to live up to expectations. To start with, the new look means
many users may need retraining to take full advantage of its capabilities.
Some PCs used by companies or individuals do not have enough memory or
processing power to run Chicago. So corporate PC buyers face the choice of
upgrading all their PCs or supporting two generations of PC operating
systems.
Yet for new PC users and users of recently purchased PCs, Chicago represents
a breakthrough in performance and ease of use. With this new version of
Windows, Microsoft appears set to maintain its tight grip on the market.
