FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: Microsoft polishes its 'Windows'

A number of enhancements to 'Windows', Microsoft's best-selling PC operating
environment, are on the horizon.
The next technology will be Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Version 2 -
which will be shipped in the coming months as part of products such as
Microsoft Publisher.
The idea behind OLE is that all types of information can be treated as
'objects' that can be copied, moved or manipulated within any Windows
application program. Object types include text, graphics, animation
sequences, short film clips, voice messages and spreadsheet models.
OLE will provide flexibility to PC users who are familiar with the options
on all of the applications programs at their disposal. Yet it threatens to
plunge less-experienced users into unfamiliar territory without obvious
means of escape, creating potential support problems.
Merging MS-Dos and Windows as a single PC operating system will result in a
program called Chicago. It will feature 'pre-emptive multitasking' meaning
that several functions can be carried out simultaneously.
Microsoft is pinning a great deal of hope on Chicago, which is scheduled for
introduction in about 12 months. 'Chicago will be the most popular systems
update we have ever put out,' Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, said.
By the time Chicago is shipped, Microsoft expects that there will be 50m
copies of Windows sold - and Gates says that if Chicago does not generate at
least Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) in sales during its first year he will be
disappointed.
Due in about 18 months, Cairo is the ultimate version of Windows. It will
'learn' how each user works, enabling them to customise the way they
organise and find information on their computer.
