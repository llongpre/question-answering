So Bill Gates, Wunderkind entrepreneur, co-founder of Microsoft and the
richest man in the US, is not invincible after all. His well-flagged book on
the future of the information highway, titled The Road Ahead, has taken a
wrong turn on the way to publication.
Viking, which is thought to have paid an advance of more than Dollars 2.5m
for the rights to publish Gates's musings, now says that the book's release
has been postponed - from November to next March.
Also delayed - again - is the launch of Microsoft's next version of Windows
PC software, which was originally scheduled for release in 1993 and is not
now expected until May or June 1995. Could the latter have proved something
of a distraction for the first-time author?
