   Call it toothy gold, a get-rich quick plan for
an area devastated by the crash of the oil market.
   Across Louisiana's marshes, once flush with profits from black
gold, small patches of land increasingly are being turned into
alligator farms, with investors hoping to quintuple their
investments in short order.
   ``Year before last, there were just under 9,000 farm-raised
gators sold'' by 37 farms, said Dave Taylor, alligator research
coordinator for Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
``That number is going to reach 60,000 quickly and could be up to
100,000, certainly, within five years.''
   That's in addition to the 24,000 wild alligators trapped each
fall in carefully supervised hunts.
   Spurred by prices of $37 a linear foot for hides, 21 new farms
have opened in the past two years, and ``We expect them to produce
18,000 gators,'' Taylor said. The waiting list for permits for new
farms is about 100.
   Jerry Jones Jr., 28, went into business two years ago near
Sweetlake and expects to put 12,000 hides a year on the market. His
farm is state-of-the-art: automated cleaning, water-source heat
pumps, carefully supervised diets.
   The result is quicker growth at less cost. ``We have some are 5-6
feet long in a year and six months. We have 8-month-old gators that
are 26-30 inches.''
   Skins of wild alligators average seven feet in length, and are
used for luggage. Farm-raised gators are skinned at two years old
and about four feet long. Their hides are used for shoes, purses,
belts and other smaller high-fashion accoutrements requiring smaller
patterns on the hides.
   For about $30,000 a potential farmer can put up a couple
windowless cinder-block buildings on concrete slabs and be ready to
raise 1,000 gators a year. It would take another $25,000 to $30,000
to operate until the gators grew enough to sell. At current prices,
1,000 four-foot hides would bring $148,000.
   ``The minimum requirements are 1 square foot per alligator up to
two feet in length and 2 square feet up to four feet in length,''
Taylor said. Buildings must be able to hold a few inches of water
and be kept about 89 degrees.
   The first thing is to gather alligator eggs from wild nests,
paying landowners for the eggs and committing 17 percent of the
hatch for return to the wild at 4 feet long. That's a carefully
researched percentage designed for zero growth in the population of
1.5 million wild alligators _ reached after the alligator was taken
off the endangered species list in the mid-1970s.
   The wild nests aren't easy to find, and female alligators guard
their eggs _ about the only time in their lives they show maternal
instincts.
   No task for the timid, Taylor agreed. ``But everybody's got to
learn some time or another, if they want to get into farming.
   ``Obviously, what would be best, for a guy's first involvement,
would be to hire someone with a little experience in locating nests
from the air. That's the only way to go: rent a helicopter and go
find them and pick them up.''
   The success of farming ventures will almost certainly drive
prices down, and there are risks any time a market depends on
fashion or something volatile, he said. ``I don't think the bottom
will fall out of the price. I don't think they'll go to $2 a foot.
But it certainly could go to half of what it is now.''
   Jones, a former trapper, commercial diver and underwater welder
who now devotes full time to his farm, agrees with Taylor's
analysis. ``A lot of these farms, you'll see what happens. Prices
are good right now, but with all these hides coming on the market,
it's going to have to go down.''
   But Jones believes he will survive when others fail because his
expenses are low. ``Look at it this way, you've got an electricity
bill of $500 a month to raise 1,000 alligators, and my bill is $150
a month to raise 12,000.''
   His major problem is finding enough nutria _ small water rodents
_ to feed the gators. Nutria often are dyed like beaver, and Jones
said, ``The price of skins is so low, right now, that you can't get
all you want. Last year I got 40,000 pounds, and I could have used
140,000.''
   He had to supplement with fish and horse, and young alligators
don't grow as quickly on that diet. In addition, too much fish gives
alligators gout.
