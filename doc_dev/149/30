<LEADPARA>  Candor has its price, and for Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates, it's
apparently $320 million.;    That was the amount that Gates' "paper fortune"
shrank Wednesday as the result of a 7 percent decline in Microsoft's stock
blamed on Wall Street reaction to Gates' memo on the numerous challenges
facing his company.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CANDID MEMO COSTS MICROSOFT'S GATES A FORTUNE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Gates' six-page lament, originally intended for the Redmond, Wash.,
software supplier's senior staff but later leaked, told how Microsoft has
cultivated an opponent rather than an ally in IBM; how Microsoft has made no
inroads in the fast-growing networking marketplace; and how it stands to lose
sales to leaner competitors, such as Borland International Inc. of Scotts
Valley.;    Gates has a reputation as a competitor-obsessed worrier to begin
with -- and the memo ends on an upbeat note, with Gates trumpeting his
strategy to make the Windows control program an even bigger success. But
Microsoft shares nonetheless fell $8.13 to close at $103.38 in trading that
was more than double normal levels. Gates owns about a third of the 115
million outstanding shares of Microsoft stock.;    Previously trading at about
30 times earnings, Microsoft has long been one of Wall Street's pricier
stocks. Analysts said that by concentrating in a single document so much bad
news about Microsoft, the memo brought to the surface a lingering investor
concern that Microsoft might be overvalued.;    "The market is pricing a new
risk into the Microsoft story," said David Readerman, analyst at Shearson
Lehman in San Francisco.;    Despite the dramatic drop in the stock price,
Gates -- who was traveling in Europe on Wednesday -- should not despair, as
there is life after a self-critical memo.;    Ask Autodesk Inc., the Sausalito
design software company whose stock is close to its 52-week high despite a
blistering 44-page memo by founder John Walker released 2 1/2 months ago -- a
document Gates cited as inspiration for his own.;    Walker called his memo
"The Final Days" and compared Autodesk to NASA before the explosion of the
space shuttle.;    "I am deeply concerned about the future of the company,"
Walker wrote. "Autodesk possesses all the prerequisites to lead the next
generation of the PC industry, yet it seems to have become stuck in the past,
mired in bureaucracy, paralyzed by unwarranted caution and to have lost the
edge of rapid and responsive product development and aggressive marketing and
promotion on which the success of Autocad (its key product) was founded.";   
Walker, who retired from all formal management tasks at the firm three years
ago but who still owns 4 percent of its stock, went on to make a number of
specific recommendations for the company, some of which have been implemented.
Others will be enacted in a reorganization planned for July 1, a spokesman
said.;    This spate of high-level soul-searching by leading industry
executives has led some Silicon Valley managers to wonder if they weren't
missing some important rite of corporate passage by not setting pen to paper
about their own internal problems.;    "I started thinking, 'Gee, I better
write a memo about our company,' " cracked Brad Bishop, chairman of Avcom, a
Palo Alto firm that sells work stations.;    Walker's memo is in a long
tradition of public self-criticism at Autodesk; it was given out freely to the
firm's 1,100 employees, and a dozen previous efforts have been published in a
book.;    Discussing the chance of a memo being given to a competitor or
reporter, the memo called such risks "unavoidable consequences of placing the
issues on Autodesk's agenda," especially since management had previously not
heeded private warnings. "If Autodesk doesn't remedy these shortcomings, they
will soon be sufficiently obvious that competitors won't need me to point them
out."  </TEXT>
