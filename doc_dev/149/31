<LEADPARA>  Microsoft stock has soared past $100, raising Chairman Bill Gates' net worth
to more than $4 billion and making him possibly the second-richest person in
America.;    On a strong thumbs-up recommendation from a leading New York
investment firm, Microsoft stock climbed more than $5 a share Wednesday,
passing its 52-week high of $102. Shares fell $2.75 on Thursday to close at
$103, but some analysts were recommending the stock to investors as a buy as
high as $130 a share.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GATES' NET WORTH SOARS INTO BOLIVIA'S NEIGHBORHOOD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     At most recent count, Gates owned more than 40 million shares of Microsoft.
Based on figures in the Oct. 22 issue of Forbes magazine's "400 Richest" list,
Gates would trail only Metromedia magnate John Werner Kluge, whose estimated
worth was $5.6 billion.;    Put in other terms, Gates' fortune rivals the
gross national products of Bolivia and Afghanistan. An average American wage
earner would have to work 100,000 to 150,000 years to equal the amount. Gates
was traveling out of the country and not available for comment, but Microsoft
insiders say he downplays discussions of wealth and does not follow the stock
price. Ironically, he is not Microsoft's highest-paid employee, earning
$261,000 a year compared with President Michael Hallman's $1.7 million
salary.;    The buying frenzy took hold after Goldman Sachs investment analyst
Rick Sherlund said he believed Microsoft will announce next week it is
entering a new market -- the development of software for computers based on a
chip from Mips Computer Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale. The chips (known as RISC,
or reduced instruction-set computing) are used in powerful corporate,
scientific and engineering computers and networks.  </TEXT>
