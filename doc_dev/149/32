Microsoft chairman and co-founder Bill Gates is careful to whom he gives his
home telephone number, but John Seabrook, interviewing Gates in the latest
Esquire magazine, tells us the nerdish-looking multi-billionaire is more
than happy to communicate via e-mail.
Seabrook struck up a matey electronic relationship with 'Billg', quickly
learning to copy the maestro by dispensing with formalities such as Dear and
Yours.
Gates apparently spends two hours a day reading and writing e-mail. While
Gates gives little away - 'having lots of money is a corrupting thing' gives
a flavour - former girl friends recall his apparent indifference to personal
hygiene and his spectacles being so grimy as to be ineffective. Gates says
he invariably runs a comb through his hair before dispatching e-mail -
'hoping to appear attractive'. Most odd.
