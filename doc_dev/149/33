   Walter ``Skeet'' Rogers put on metal
gloves, grabbed a 3-foot-long alligator and slung it into a cotton
wagon, moving it to high ground before flood waters got it.
   ``The last time we got to fooling with them, one man got 47
stitches,'' Rogers said, explaining the gloves.
   Rogers' 4,000 alligators were hatched from eggs gathered from
wild nests and raised in double-decked ponds in four
climate-controlled cinder-block buildings. Two more buildings are
under construction at his Bayou Pierre Gator Farm, located on low
land near the bayou for which it is named.
   About 200 square miles of Louisiana is flooded by water from the
Red River and backwaters such as Bayou Pierre. Most of the land in
a sparsely settled section of the state is for farming cotton,
wheat, soybeans.
   Rogers' crop is different, though no less threatened.
   ``It's awful. The water keeps coming up,'' said Alice Hart,
Rogers' mother. ``I've been right here for 12 years, and nothing
like this has ever happened before.
   ``They'll drown. Skeet sold off some of the big ones, but the
rest will just drown, if it keeps coming up.''
   With hides bringing $35 a linear foot and demand for alligator
meat high, alligator farming is a burgeoning industry in an
economically depressed state. Louisiana has 92 licensed gator
farms. Two-dozen license applications are pending. Three years ago,
there were 13 alligator farms in Louisiana.
   Buddy Goatcher, an alligator biologist with the state Department
of Wildlife and Fisheries, said it is possible gators could be
drowned if trapped in deep water for a long time with no firm
resting place.
   ``The farmer can't predict how long the waters will be up,''
Goatcher said. ``And you can't predict the force of the water. It
could knock down the building and send gators spewing all over the
place.''
   ``The threat is not so much to the well-being of the gators.
They'd love it,'' he said. ``The threat is losing the farm.''
   Along with the buildings and the concrete ponds, special heaters
are necessary to keep it warm enough for a good hatching rate and
optimum growth.
   ``He doesn't want a lot of cold water coming in,'' Goatcher said.
   Rogers and two helpers, Roy Cheatwood and his son, Roy Jr.,
piled homemade sandbags around pumps, heaters and other immovable
equipment, trying to protect them from the flood.
   The alligators were packed into four cotton wagons parked on a
nearby mound.
   Each gator had to be moved by hand.
   ``We can't get behind them with horses and drive them to high
ground,'' Rogers said.
