   Alligator hunters are poised to fan out
over lakes and canals for the start of the state's second gator
season in a quarter-century, and hide and meat processors won't be
far behind.
   Under new rules, the 221 licensed hunters must kill alligators
immediately by harpoon or bang-stick, a hand-held device that shoots
a .22-caliber cartridge on impact.
   Last year, most of the 2,979 gators bagged were captured and
brought to processors alive. Several airboats were capsized but no
serious injuries were reported in the hunt, the state's first in 26
years.
   Dead gators must be skinned within four hours to keep the meat
from spoiling, so hide and meat processors have made arrangements to
get the fresh meat in cold storage quickly.
   ``The industry has addressed the needs and is taking whatever
actions are necessary to ensure that the quality of the meat is
preserved,'' said Dennis David, coordinator of state alligator
programs. ``Many of them were making arrangements to have ice trucks
and refrigerated trucks and large coolers to purchase carcasses at
the lake shore.''
   Wildlife officials say the state's population of about 1 million
alligators won't be hurt by the monthlong hunt, beginning a
half-hour before sunset today.
   A study of Lake Okeechobee gators indicates the hunt actually may
improve the health of the general population by reducing the number
of reptiles competing for survival, David said.
   The state revived the hunt last year to help trim the gator
population, which has doubled since stringent anti-poaching measures
were adopted in 1970.
   Okeechobee, one of 32 bodies of water open to the hunters, is
drawing particular attention following reported sightings of an
18-foot alligator east of Clewiston on the lake's southwest shore.
   Yet, some feel it's mostly a tall tale.
   ``It's probably 90 percents rumor,'' said Charles Lawhon of Moore
Haven. ``If it's there, it's a well-smart alligator and it keeps
well hidden.''
   Hunters can earn about $500 for the skin and meat of a 4-foot
gator, and prices for large bulls can reach $1,000. The biggest
gator bagged last year stretched 13 feet, 4 inches.
   Parts of the Everglades in western Dade and Broward counties will
be off-limits, despite above-average alligator populations, because
of excessive mercury levels.
   The state selected 229 names at random from among 20,163
applicants for hunting licenses. All but eight attended a six-hour
training session and paid a $250 fee for the right to kill 15 gators
each, David said.
   David expects this year's catch to be about 2,900 again.
