Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has appointed Mr
Robert Herbold, a former Procter &amp; Gamble executive, as executive
vice-president and chief operating officer, writes Louise Kehoe in San
Francisco.
Mr Herbold will report directly to Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and
chief executive, as a member of Microsoft's 'office of the president',
succeeding the late Mr Frank Gaudette, who died in April.
He joins Mr Steve Ballmer, executive vice-president of sales and support,
and Mr Mike Maples, executive vice-president of products, as a member of the
office. This group shares responsibility with Mr Gates for broad strategic
and business planning for the entire company.
Mr Herbold worked for P&amp;G for 26 years, most recently as senior
vice-president for information services and advertising.
The appointment by Microsoft of an outsider to such a senior position is
surprising. In the past Mr Gates has expressed scepticism about the choice
of executives from other industries such as Mr Lou Gerstner of IBM to head
computer companies.
Yesterday, however, Mr Gates said that Mr Herbold's business experience and
management skills 'will prove invaluable in taking Microsoft forward as we
face new business challenges'.
Mr Herbold will be responsible for worldwide operations at Microsoft,
including finance, manufacturing, distribution, logistics, information
technology, human resources, corporate services, real estate and development
and Microsoft Press.
