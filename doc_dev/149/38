   Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates unveiled
his grand vision of the future of personal computing Monday, an era
in which desktop and handheld machines will provide a window to
vast amounts of information.
   In the keynote address at the giant Comdex computer show, Gates
described a future in which computers are much more useful and
easier to use.
   Gates, whose company developed the most widely used operating
system for personal computers, outlined new technologies that will
bring video, voice and handwriting recognition capabilities to
personal computers.
   ``This is a formidable challenge. No single company is going to
be able to do this,'' he said.
   Gates called for cooperation among computer hardware and
software companies to bring about his vision, which he calls
``information at your fingertips.''
   In an amusing series of videos on a giant screen, Gates depicted
how computers containing these new technologies would be used in
the mythical town of Twin Points, a spoof of the TV series ``Twin
Peaks.''
   In one example, he showed how a deliveryman for Twin Points
Bakery would use a book-sized handheld computer that recognized
handwriting to enter orders at a grocery store.
   Using a special pen, or stylus, the deliveryman wrote in the
orders for various items on the computer screen. The computer
verified the order by printing the quantity.
   When the grocer balked at ordering a certain amount of one item,
the deliveryman used the screen to display a bar chart showing how
much of that item sold at the store in a certain period.
   When the grocer also ordered a new display rack, the computer
flashed a warning that he was over his credit limit with the
bakery.
   But through a cellular phone device inside the machine, the
computer contacted a central computer at the bakery, which then
authorized the display rack but required the grocer to ``sign'' for
it on the handheld computer screen, using the stylus.
   In another video, Gates showed how a student using a
computerized encyclopedia could do a report on the state of
Washington, where Microsoft is based.
   A ``page'' of the encyclopedia depicting facts about Washington
showed a picture of the state bird. Beside the bird was a small
picture, called an icon, of several musical notes. When the student
moved an on-screen arrow to the icon, and then pushed a button on a
device called a mouse, the computer played a short audio passage of
the bird's song stored in its memory.
   The encyclopedia also gave a chart of the state's leading
industries, software among them. When the arrow was placed on
``Microsoft,'' a small picture of the company's offices came on the
screen. When the arrow was moved to the picture and the mouse
button pushed, the computer played a video of several of the
company's employees.
   Gates also showed a video of a couple designing a house. When
they wanted to visualize various layouts, their architect allowed
them to ``walk through'' a three-dimensional model of their
proposed home on a computer screen. The couple also could see on
the screen how various color schemes would look, and when they
wanted to look at appliances, the architect called up a video
advertisement from an oven manufacturer.
   Gates, 35, said these new technologies are not some science
fiction dream, but are under development or already in use. In
fact, such combinations of text, graphics, sound and videos -
called multimedia computing - are among the hot topics at this
year's Comdex.
   One of the keys to Gates' vision is tying together the
technologies of handwriting recognition, computerized video, fax,
cellular phones, computing networks and vast data bases in one
seamless hardware and software package.
   But, he said, several obstacles need to be removed before his
scheme becomes reality.
   One is that personal computers are too hard to use. Another, he
said, is that ``people have a very narrow view of how the PC should
be used.''
   Gates' speech kicked off a weeklong Comdex show that promoters
say has attracted about 120,000 computer retailers, distributors
and others in the industry.
