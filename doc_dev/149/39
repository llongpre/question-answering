WHO needs technology 'vision'? Certainly not International Business
Machines, according to Lou Gerstner, the computer giant's tough new chairman
and chief executive.
'The last thing IBM needs is vision,' he declared last month, in a statement
that is stirring widespread debate throughout the computer industry.
The 'vision thing' is a hot topic among those who like to wax lyrical about
their views on the path that technology developments will take in coming
years; 'information highways' and 'industry convergence' are their favourite
topics. All seem to see their companies playing a critical role as these
visions unfold.
Yet apart from drumming up enthusiasm for technology in general, is there
any value to this star gazing?
Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, founded his company on a 'vision' of how
microprocessor chips would put 'a personal computer on every desk and in
every home,' and the opportunities that this would create for selling
software programs.
'Paul Allen (Microsoft co-founder) and I wrote that down on day one,' Gates
recalls. Eighteen years, and several billions of revenue dollars, later
Gates still sets aside a few 'think weeks' each year to 'figure out trends
that are going to affect us and what we ought to be doing about them. It is
something you have to give a lot of thought to.'
What does Gates make of Gerstner's apparent disdain for vision? 'It depends
what you mean by vision,' he responds. 'In the broad sense, it is not
sufficient or necessary. But having a technology strategy, figuring out the
industry direction, the factors that are influencing the business and the
synergies between them is very important.'
According to Mike Maples, Microsoft executive vice-president: 'Vision is
knowing where to go'. Picking the technologies that are going to be
important and then being willing to invest in them is a key ingredient of
industry leadership, he maintains.
Vision can, however, be blinding. In the past, IBM was prone to seeing the
information industry through Big Blue-tinted glasses. Hence, the company
mapped out a grand strategy called SAA that pulled all the disparate pieces
of its technology together, but failed to recognise that the market was
taking a different path defined by industry standards.
Lew Platt, Hewlett-Packard chief executive, takes a more pragmatic approach
to 'vision'. 'While we're excited about our vision of the future and how HP
can participate in its creation, we don't intend to get blinded by 'the
vision thing',' he recently told customers. 'Computer makers must keep sight
of a 'basic truth'. We build things customers want. They are the architects
of our vision.'
However, customers with a vested interest in today's technology are not
always the best seers. Users of H-P computers no doubt foresee a great
future for Unix, but it is a fair bet that buyers of Microsoft's programs
look forward to new versions of Windows. Similarly, users of IBM mainframes
are unlikely to tell the company to get out of that business.
Too much vision can also be a dangerous thing, as Apple Computer has
discovered. While putting its energies into long-term innovative projects,
such as Newton, Apple has failed to maintain the momentum of its core
Macintosh personal computer business. Computer companies cannot afford to
become so excited about the future that they lose focus on near-term issues
and priorities.
Many high-technology visions also turn out to be pipe dreams. Steve Jobs's
Next Computer, which he had hoped to build into a computer company repeating
his success at Apple, is one of the most celebrated examples.
Indeed, there are many reasons to avoid technology vision. It can be
blinding, expensive, misleading and fleeting. Yet companies without it must
inevitably rely upon the foresight of others, becoming technology followers
rather than leaders.
