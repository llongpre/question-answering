   A change of corporate culture is in store for
Michael Hallman, who is trading the presidency of Boeing Computer
Services for the same job at Microsoft Corp.
   Boeing is nearing its 75th anniversary; Microsoft was founded in
the mid-1970s. Boeing deals with everything from fax machines to
fluid dynamics models; Microsoft focuses on computer software.
   Boeing has airplane models expected to be in development or use
for 50 to 70 years; the software industry has to react to sudden
market changes.
   ``It's going to be a fun place to work,'' Hallman said in an
interview Tuesday. ``It's a place where you can work hard, be
successful and have fun doing it.''
   Hallman, 44, was named earlier this week by Bill Gates,
Microsoft's 34-year-old billionaire chairman and chief executive,
to succeed Jon A. Shirley, who retires June 30. Hallman will join
Microsoft April 2.
   Hallman, who also will be chief operating officer, described his
new job as overseeing day-to-day operations while company founder
Gates provides overall product and development direction.
   The key, he said, will be to help Microsoft cope with ``the
realities that rapid growth and large size create, but at the same
time ensure there's the entrepreneurial spirit and environment that
has kept the creativity flowing there.''
   Microsoft has about 5,000 employees and is expected to hit $1
billion in sales in 1990. Its operating system software for IBM
personal computers and compatibles is the industry standard.
Microsoft also leads in applications software such as word
processing programs and programming languages.
   At Boeing Computer Services, Hallman directed about 13,000
employees and a Boeing Co. division that does more than $1 billion
in business a year.
   About two-thirds of the division's work is for Boeing, but
selling computer time and its expertise in data management and
telecommunications brought about $360 million in sales last year.
   BCS handles information management for all Boeing divisions,
writes software and develops technologies such as artificial
intelligence and computer-aided design and manufacturing.
   It operates about $1.3 billion worth of computer gear, including
a state-of-the-art Cray supercomputer. It also has one of the
world's largest private telecommunications networks, linking six
major data centers nationwide.
   And its customers include large corporations and the federal
government _ the sort Microsoft also would like.
   ``I think that's an area where my background would lend itself
well,'' Hallman said.
   Besides selling to such customers, Hallman also brings the
perspective of an individual computer operator _ he has three in
his home _ and a large, corporate computer user. Boeing Computer
was in charge of acquiring the company's 43,000 personal computers
and the software for them.
   Hallman does not foresee Microsoft switching its emphasis on
desktop computers used by individuals and small businesses, but he
said the 1990s will see more personal computers linked in networks
and with large mainframes. Microsoft's products will need to
reflect that, he said.
   Hallman joined Boeing three years ago after spending 20 years at
International Business Machines Corp., much of that in sales and
marketing. He ran Boeing Computer's outside sales until he was
named president in November 1987.
   Microsoft spokesman Marty Taucher said Hallman's compensation
would be comparable to that of Shirley, who made $315,000 a year,
according to Microsoft's 1989 proxy statement.
   Hallman said he was approached by Microsoft about the
president's job last fall, with contact accelerating after Shirley
formally announced his retirement earlier this year.
   In recent weeks, Hallman said he spent a lot of time with Gates
and other Microsoft senior executives, discussing the job and
``making sure the chemistry was right.''
   ``Bill and I get along great,'' Hallman said. ``I think the
facts are we share the same enthusiasm and passion and vision for
where this technology is going to go.''
   Hallman added that the change in corporate history and style
from Boeing to Microsoft would be an advantage. ``It would be a
mistake to bring someone in who had exactly the same view because
no value would be added there,'' he said.
