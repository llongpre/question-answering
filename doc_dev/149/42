   Most alligator hunters were disappointed
after the first day of Florida's month-long gator season, but by
Friday morning some lucky ones bagged animals as long as nine feet.
   Thursday at sunset marked the beginning of the first legal
alligator hunt in 26 years for the lucky _ or not-so-lucky _ 230
people granted permits to catch the reptiles with harpoons, nooses,
crossbows and almost anything but a gun.
   The first night of the 30-day hunt netted about 130 alligators
in 28 designated hunting areas across the state, according to the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. Thirty-eight were
bagged in the Everglades, while 36 were taken in the Lake
Okeechobee area, a spokesman said.
   Two novice hunters, David and Jerry Navin, snaked through a Dade
County canal in the darkness looking for the red-reflecting eyes
that give away the swimming reptiles, but the gators refused to
cooperate.
   ``There's a few here, but they're not really doing what they're
supposed to,'' chuckled David Navin. ``They're a little tougher
than we thought.''
   His brother Jerry called their experience ``on-the-job
training.''
   To the north on Lake Okeechobee, one of the designated hunting
areas, some gator pursuers reported better luck.
   Thomas Alpern, 25, of Brooklyn, N.Y., the only northerner
receiving a permit, bagged a nine-footer despite worrying
beforehand that he might be unable to kill the animal even when he
captured it.
   With gator hides selling for $42 a foot and meat running up to
$6 a pound, Alpern and others persevered, though few expected to
bag their 15-gator limit the first night.
   Hide and meat sales from a single alligator can total $300 to
$500.
   ``We're having fun,'' said Bud Wolfe, an alligator hunter from
Oakland Park. ``Where else but in Africa can you go after a
500-pound animal that can kill you?''
   Early success came to Carlos Donate of Miami and his guide, Jay
Medore of Clewiston. They snagged a 8-foot-3-inch animal only 80
minutes after they started hunting on Lake Okeechobee.
   Once they got the gator reeled up to the side of the boat, they
shot it with a ``bang stick,'' a firearm-like gadget that is
allowed under the game commission rules.
   ``We blew one hell of a hole in his head,'' Donate said. ``It
was exciting.''
   He then taped the gator's mouth shut.
   ``It's scary putting that tape on his mouth, even with a hole in
his head,'' he said.
   Doug Mackie and Steve Prater, who work for the city of Pembroke
Pines' utilities department, bagged a 6-foot alligator and another
that was 8 feet or longer.
   Prater showed how he hooked one just beside the alligator's left
rear leg with a large hook on a heavy-duty saltwater fishing rod.
He said fighting the gator when it was hooked was very difficult,
and he snapped the heavy fiberglass rod.
   ``It was a deep-sea rod and it just plain snapped in two,'' he
marveled.
   Alligator hunting was outlawed in Florida in 1962 because
wildlife biologists feared overhunting of the ancient reptiles
might threaten the survival of the alligator.
   A small alligator industry has built up in recent years because
alligators have increasingly become problems by turning up in urban
areas and pestering and occasionally killing humans or their pets.
   Estimates place the current number of alligators living in
Florida at 1 million, and game commission officials said they are
now far from an ``endangered'' species.
