   Plans to install floating toilets for the
convenience of boaters on reservoirs east and west of here aren't
exactly getting flushed down the tubes by concerned officials.
   ``It may seem that this is something kind of frivolous, but when
you think about it, when you gotta go, you gotta go,'' Maricopa
County parks Director Bill Richwine said Thursday.
   For a boater on the northeast corner of Lake Pleasant, ``your
only alternative is to go ashore and get behind a cactus or go over
into the water and do it,'' Richwine said.
   Richwine envisions two floating toilets anchored in the upper,
more remote regions of the lake about 25 miles northwest of Phoenix.
   Each would be a one-holer restroom floating on pontoons. They
would have holding tanks similar to those in the portable toilets
used at construction sites, golf tourneys and concerts.
   Richwine said he would make the county Board of Supervisors
privy to his plans in two weeks in order to apply for a $90,000
State Lake Improvement Fund grant to pay for the restrooms and a
trailer to haul them.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service is considering putting six
floating potties on Roosevelt Lake about 60 miles northeast of
Phoenix, said David Killebrew of Tonto National Forest.
   The toilets are part of an $18 million improvement plan for the
popular water-sports site, Killebrew said. Construction is to begin
in 1990.

   A small alligator found snoozing in a
Memphis vegetable garden is just a run-of-the-mill reptile and not
a missing sex-changed gator stolen from Memphis State University, a
biologist says.
   The researcher who changed the missing alligator's sex examined
the garden gator and pronounced it a different, ordinary reptile,
Memphis State biology department Chairman Jim Payne said recently.
   The missing alligator was stolen last November from a biology
laboratory at Memphis State.
   The 2-foot-long gator was one of a dozen or so used to study the
effects of hormones and environment on reptile sex determination.
While still in the egg, it was changed from a boy to a girl.
   An alligator fitting the missing animal's description turned up
in a garden June 14, but the only person who could confirm the
reptile's identity, biologist William Gutzke, was in the Galapagos
Islands inspecting the sex organs of turtles.
   Gutzke passed through town a few days ago, examined the
alligator and decided it was not his, Payne said.
   A Memphis resident says the garden gator might be Allie, a
missing pet he brought back from Louisiana for his
