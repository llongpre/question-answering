   With smoke, loud music and MTV-style videos,
Microsoft Corp. Tuesday formally introduced its new version of
Windows, a software product designed to make IBM personal computers
and their clones as easy to use as Macintosh computers.
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's 34-year-old chairman, told hundreds of
financial analysts, journalists and others at a New York theater
that Windows is ``a major milestone in the history of the PC
industry.''
   Many analysts agree. They say Windows could provide the
strongest challenge yet to Apple Computer Inc.'s popular Macintosh
by grafting its user-friendly operations onto International
Business Machines Corp. personal computers and compatible models _
machines that are notorious for their arcane commands.
   Gates told the standing-room-only crowd _ and, by satellite
hookup, audiences in six other cities nationwide _ that his
Redmond, Wash.-based software company will spend $10 million
promoting Windows over the next six months. He called that a record
for the software industry.
   Microsoft plans to mail 400,000 demonstration copies of the $149
software to personal computer users, Gates told the audience after
a sound-and-light show that mixed hype, humor and product
demonstrations.
   More than 30 personal computer companies have said they will
include Windows with their machines, and dozens of software
companies are making applications programs compatible with the new
version of Windows.
   Windows could provide a major boost to Microsoft, which already
dominates the personal computer software industry. Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. projects Windows and related products will reap nearly
$500 million in revenues for Microsoft in the fiscal year that
starts July 1.
   ``I think it's the most significant announcement since the
introduction of DOS,'' said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., referring to the operating system for IBM personal
computers developed by Microsoft.
   ``This delivers a lot of the capabilities that normally have
been associated with the Mac to the PC,'' he said, referring to IBM
machines and their knockoffs.
   The loser, of course, could be Apple. A Windows-equipped IBM
clone could sell for as little as half the price of a Macintosh.
   Apple's stock dropped a total of $2 a share Friday and Monday,
after adjusting for a dividend, but rose $1.87{ a share Tuesday to
close at $41.37{ in national over-the-counter trading.
   Microsoft shares jumped $1.25 Tuesday to close at $71.50 in
over-the-counter trading, after rising a total of $5.50 Friday and
Monday in anticipation of the announcement.
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to announce a
lower-priced Macintosh later this year and is working on a more
powerful version of its operating system.
   Most computer experts also say the Macintosh retains some
advantages over a Windows-equipped IBM machine, expecially for
intensive graphics-based uses.
   Microsoft, for its part, says it will not target Macintosh users
or potential users, instead pitching Windows to users of IBM
machines and compatible models.
   That strategy is due in part to the fact that 85 percent of the
computer market is composed of IBM machines or clones, compared
with the Macintosh's 7 percent share.
   Windows works on computers using Intel Corp.'s 80286, 80386 or
80486 microprocessors. That encompasses about 20 million computers
in use, out of about 50 million that use the DOS operating system,
Microsoft says.
   This is Microsoft's third version of Windows. The first version,
introduced in 1985, and a later enhancement both failed to impress
computer experts.
   Windows is product known as a graphical user interface. It
shields computer users from complex, typed commands by replacing
them with on-screen pictures called icons and a hand-held control
device called a mouse.
   Windows also expands a computer's useable memory capacity and
allows users to keep several applications programs active at once
by running them in sections of the screen called windows.
