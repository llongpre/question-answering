   An 8-foot alligator is a full day's work,
Dale Dunaway reckons.
   First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thick
hide at the tip of its tail. Then it's a slow and difficult cut to
the snout.
   ``You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin and
gut a gator,'' Dunaway, who operates one of Florida's few alligator
processing facilities, said Tuesday. ``There's no way around it.
It's hard work, you bet.''
   At the Gator House in the remote southwest Florida grasslands,
Dunaway and his relatives have sharpened their knives and readied
the pots in anticipation of the first statewide gator hunt since
the 37-year-old Dunaway was a boy spearing alligators at nearby
Lake Trafford.
   For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, 238 license holders
will be stalking areas of the state where the gator population is
extraordinarly high. The hunt, the first since 1962, is needed to
trim the numbers of the once-threatened alligator, which has
rebounded strongly since strict anti-poaching measures were
instituted in the early 1970s.
   The estimated 1 million alligators in Florida is nearly double
the 1975 population, said Allan Woodward, head of the alligator
research unit for the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   With each permit holder allowed up to 15 gators, Dunaway is
prepared to easily exceed the 130 gators skinned at the plant since
it opened in 1986.
   ``We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday,
either skinning or hunting,'' he said. ``We're gonna be looking at
a lot of dead gators.''
   Some of the veteran hunters will be permitted to use the
equipment at the gator house, a cement frame enclosed by screen
wire and decorated by a few deer antlers and empty beer cans. A few
junk cars rest nearby while the cicadas scream incessantly.
   But the novice trappers, randomly selected from 5,000
applications, will watch their catch be pried apart.
   Alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hide
covering the belly and underarms, said Dunaway. The hide, which
sells for about $42 a foot to foreign manufacturers, is submerged
in a brine solution for about a week.
   The excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried.
   ``And we bury the innards as far away as possible,'' said
Dunaway. ``They got a powerful smell, and if you ever cut open the
stomach you better start running.''
   The meat _ which Dunaway says makes a nice addition to spaghetti
sauce _ must be frozen within several hours after the alligator is
killed. One 12-foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230
pounds of meat.
   ``You're fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch like
that,'' said Dunaway's brother, Grant, 34.
   Yet the gator business is just a hobby for the Dunaways and
uncle William Busby, 36. All will take vacation time from their
jobs to process the gators.
   They say the best they can do charging a $30 fee and $2 a pound
is break even.
   ``We just like it out here with the gators,'' said Grant.
   With state officials publicizing that a 10-foot gator could net
$1,000 in meat and skin, Dale Dunaway wonders if greed rather than
adventure is motivating the new hunters.
   ``You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going
to make money off this hunt,'' he said. ``They don't figure in the
time, expenses _ and don't forget the danger. I'd like to see some
people's faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat.
   ``But if they want to catch 'em, then we'll skin 'em. We'll just
say, `Stack 'em up.'''
   He folded his knife in a triumphant clap.
