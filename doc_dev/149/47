<LEADPARA>  GOT A SPOUSE at Stewart Alsop's computer industry conference in Southern
California this week? When your other half returns, be sure to ask about that
doll Alsop had waiting in their hotel room.;   If they respond with a blush or
a gasp, you've got a problem. Otherwise, you've got something new for your
curio shelf. (Whew!)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Alsop's little bonus was reserved for the 30 or so executives who have
attended all five of his conferences. Returning to their rooms Sunday night,
they found a set of four nesting dolls on their pillows, each a caricature of
an industry leader.;   The largest was Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates,
who was painted holding a keyboard under one arm and a BASIC programming book
under the other. Inside Gates was Apple Computer chief John Sculley, holding a
can of Pepsi, its logo in Russian. Next was Sun Microsystem's head Scott
McNealy holding an anarchist's bomb and a scimitar. Last, and least, was a
tiny Steve Jobs doll.;   "I've paid Stewart $10,000," quipped venture
capitalist Nat Goldhaber, one of the lucky winners, "and this year I got to
sleep with Bill Gates."; (hbox);   BIG MIKE SPEAKS: What do $60 billion
companies and $6 billion companies have in common? According to Michael
Spindler, president of the $6 billion Apple Computer, the answer is "white
knuckles." That was one of the punch lines of an innovate-or-die speech
Spindler gave before a group of venture capitalists Tuesday, the highlights of
which were passed along by a heads-up attendee.;   Spindler's "In" list
includes pen-based computers, the concept of "computing" being replaced by
"remote access to data," software, and 100 MIPS desk top machines costing less
than $2,000. What's out? Well, Japanese computer companies, which are due for
a big shock because of their dependence on analog technology; UNIX, which
forgot the user, and DOS, which forgot the hardware; and Compaq Computer,
which is in the "bankruptcy zone" between innovators like Apple and Next and
low-cost producers like Dell.; (hbox);   PLAIN BROWN WRAPPER: Today's computer
users get most of their software either through retail stores or by mail
order. But the rapid development of optical CD-ROM disks may eventually make
that obsolete.;   A number of computer industry executives at the Agenda
conference said they wanted to be able to include their programs, along with
those of other publishers, on a CD-ROM disk that would be shipped with new
computers. The software would be "locked" until the user called an 800 number
that would appear during a demo of the software that would also be on the
disk. In exchange for a credit card number, the publisher would supply a
password that would unlock the software -- and permit access to the manuals,
which could also be stored on the disk.;   Publishers say the approach would
have many advantages over selling through stores, including reducing prices by
eliminating the margins that are now paid to distributors. It would also
permit users to enjoy comfortable demos of software in their own office at
their own pace, without the sales pressure.;   The only drawback now is that
too few computers are shipped with the optical disk drives. But the advent of
multimedia computers, which will rely on CD-ROMs for their dazzling graphics
and sound, may help accelerate CD-ROM software distribution.  </TEXT>
