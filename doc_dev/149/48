   Drawn by adventure and hopes of big
profits, Florida's 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are getting
ready to begin the state's first legal gator hunt in 26 years.
   More than 5,000 novice and skilled hunters alike scrambled to
apply for the permits after game officials announced the hunt,
designed to trim an alligator population that was once threatened
by poachers but is now an estimated at 1 million.
   Wide-eyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps, lakes and
streams with hopes of cashing in on their catch, which can bring as
much as $1,000 for a 10-foot gator's skin and meat.
   But some experts are wondering if the permit holders really know
what they're in for.
   ``You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going
to make money off this hunt,'' said 37-year-old Dale Dunaway, who
operates one of Florida's few alligator processing plants.
   ``They don't figure in the time, expenses _ and don't forget the
danger,'' Dunaway said Tuesday. ``I'd like to see some people's
faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat.
   For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, the randomly selected
permit holders will be allowed to hunt in designated areas where
the gator population is extraordinarily high.
   Waterfront residents all over Florida called for a hunt against
the carnivorous reptiles after a 10{-foot bull gator killed
4-year-old Erin Glover in the Gulf Coast community of Englewood in
June.
   But game officials have placed tight restrictions on the hunt.
Permit holders will be working at night, when flashlights make the
reptiles' eyes glow eerily red. And they are not allowed to use
guns, relying on clubs, traps and hooks attached to poles.
   The harvest is limited to up to 3,435 gators, with each hunter
limited to 15 gators each.
   ``We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday,
either skinning or hunting,'' Dunaway said at his 2-year-old
processing operation in this remote southwest Florida town. ``We're
gonna be looking at a lot of dead gators.''
   Skinning an average alligator is a full day's work, Dunaway
reckons.
   First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thick
hide at the tip of its tail. Then, it's a slow and difficult cut to
the snout.
   ``You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin and
gut a gator,'' said Dunaway. ``There's no way around it. It's hard
work, you bet.''
   Some of the experienced hunters will be permitted to use the
equipment at the gator house, a cement frame enclosed by screen
wire and decorated by deer antlers.
   But the novice trappers will have to sit and watch their catch
be pried apart.
   Alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hide
covering the belly and underarms, said Dunaway. The hide, which
sells for about $42 a foot to foreign manufacturers, is submerged
in a brine solution for about a week.
   The excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried.
   ``And we bury the innards as far away as possible,'' said
Dunaway. ``They got a powerful smell and if you ever cut open the
stomach you better start running.''
   The meat, which Dunaway says makes a nice addition to spaghetti
sauce, must be frozen within hours after the alligator is killed.
One 12-foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230 pounds of
meat.
   ``You're fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch like
that,'' said Dunaway's 24-year-old brother, Grant.
   Yet the gator business is just a hobby for the Dunaways and
their uncle William Busby, 36. All will take vacation time from
their jobs to process the gators.
   They say the best they can do charging a $30 fee and $2 a pound
is break even.
   ``We just like it out here with the gators,'' said Grant.
