<TEXT>
For years Bill Gates' competitors have dreamt of the day he would wed. They
hoped that marriage would distract the chairman of Microsoft, and the
richest bachelor in the US, from his single-minded dedication to building
the world's dominant computer software company.
Hence the stock market's reaction to the news that 37-year-old Gates is to
marry one of his managers, Melinda French, 28, is puzzling, to say the
least. Microsoft's shares might have been expected to fall sharply, while
rival stocks outperformed. But Microsoft's shares have continued to climb
since the announcement.
The only possible explanation is that the market fears that the merger will
lead to the production of several Gates Juniors and that this will create
even more problems for the industry.
