FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (14): Signposts on
the digital highway - Geoffrey Wheelwright on the shake-up in North America

The North American telecoms industry is in the grip of an acquisitions and
reorganisational frenzy brought on by a desperate desire to remake itself in
advance of the arrival of the much-hyped 'digital highway' or 'information
superhighway'. Governments and cable television interests also want to get
their own way in deciding the path this 'highway' will take, so the rush has
been on to make deal after deal that will give telecommunications 'content'
to offer users of the highway and enough strategic partnerships to make sure
that their particular section of the highway is not a dead end.
The truth behind all this hype is that the future could see the creation of
two or more digital highways in the US. One is likely to be controlled by
cable and satellite TV operators and the other by regional phone companies.
Given the huge political and financial will required to make such a thing
happen, it is most likely to take place first in the US (with much of Canada
probably coming along for the ride) - and much later, if at all, in the UK
and Europe.
For the past few years, as groundwork for the digital highway has been laid,
companies in both sectors have been scrambling to build strategic alliances.
AT&amp;T and the regional Bell operating companies (known as RBOCs) have built
the largest number of alliances with technology companies - while cable
television firms are scrambling to catch up.
The strongest political supporter of the information highway concept is Mr
Al Gore, the US vice-president, who has vigorously championed its
development in US political circles and has repeatedly spoken of what he
thinks its impact will be. One of his biggest pitches to US taxpayers to
support the development of the information highway has been on the subject
of job creation.
'All . . . applications (for the information highway) enhance the quality of
life - because they do, they will spur economic growth. After all, even the
quickest glance at the telecoms sector of the economy shows what it means
for jobs,' he says. 'Over half of the US workforce is now in
information-based jobs. The telecoms and information sector of the US
economy accounts for more than 12 per cent of the GDP. And it's growing
faster than any other sector of our economy. Last year total sector revenues
exceeded Dollars 700bn. And we exported over Dollars 48bn of
telecommunications equipment alone.
When AT&amp;T sold the first cellular phone, they said there would be 900,000 of
them by the year 2000. We have 13m now. And it's still 1993. The predictions
for mobile telephone users for the year 2000 now total 60m. This kind of
growth will create thousands of jobs in the communications industry. But the
biggest impact may be in other industrial sectors where those technologies
will help American companies compete better and smarter in the global
economy. If we do not move decisively to ensure that America has the
information infrastructure we need, every business and consumer in America
will suffer.'
So the real question in many people's minds is who will control access to
the highway - as well as the stops of interest along the way. The telecoms
and entertainment businesses have made the most noise about how they think
they will control the way the information highway develops - but they
apparently have not reckoned with the determination of the personal computer
industry. In particular, they have not taken account of the enthusiasm of
America's second richest man - Mr Bill Gates, co-founder and chief executive
of Microsoft - for the development of this delivery system.
He believes that the PC industry will be a key player in the development of
a national and international information infrastructure - and already has
advanced plans for Microsoft's role in that infrastructure. Bill Gates see
the starting point as information services delivered to millions of
consumers through devices attached to 'interactive' television sets.
'There will be a new device in the home connected up to the so-called
information highway that will be a replacement for the video game or the TV
or the PC,' he says. 'You will be able to call up any movie or show that has
ever been made. You'll be able to call up advice on medical things or
shopping or travel. You'll be able to find people of common interests, to
video conference with people that you know.
'It will be quite a general purpose device. It will take a lot of businesses
and change them. It will require a lot of software to do that well. There
are many software companies, including Microsoft, that are starting to see
this opportunity. We've hired several hundred people to work on this even
though it won't come to realisation for over five years.'
Bill Gates says the company 'won't get any revenue for at least three years'
from this project and 'will spend many tens of millions on it in the
meantime.'
So what is it that has given Microsoft such huge volumes of patience? The
simple answer is the realistic chance to make every home in America spent
money on Microsoft software. The software would be contained within the
system that delivers the information to the TV set.
Microsoft recently gave a demonstration of how this service could augment
existing TV entertainment. People watching a live baseball game, for
example, could use a handheld controller (not unlike the kind provided for
use with video game systems) to choose from a series of on-screen pictures
(to the left-hand side of the main picture) to bring up on-screen statistics
on either of the teams, any of the players, up-to-date out of town scores,
current position of players on the field  - and even order tickets (using a
credit card) to the home team's next game.
By tuning to an all-music TV channel, meanwhile, people can augment their
viewing with information on the artists singing the song, details about the
album it came from, what other albums the artists had released and, of
course, the chance to order the album by credit card.
The ultimate mix of computer technology, consumerism and TV, however, would
come with use of the shopping channel - where consumers could design
'virtual shopping malls' in which they were the only customers. These would
work by having the consumer designate which shops they would like to
frequent (from either an on-screen or published catalogue) and the system
would then respond by displaying a videogame-style representation of a mall
with shop fronts.
Consumers can then use the handheld controller to 'walk through' their
custom-designed on-screen malls - stopping at the shops whose goods they
might be interested in buying. These would be represented by on-screen shop
fronts which, when entered, would be replaced with an on-screen catalogue of
the goods available in that shop.
Mr Gates says that many telecom companies are talking to him about this plan
 -including US West, TCI, Time/Warner and AT&amp;T - 'it's the feeding frenzy or
gold rush around digital convergence,' he says. 'There are many people who
are trying not to be left out of the activities.'
