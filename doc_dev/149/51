   TUCSON -- Reaching beyond the personal computer industry
he now dominates, Microsoft Corp. Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer William H. Gates embraced a powerful new
chip design by Digital Equipment Corp.
   Mr. Gates's endorsement is both a boost for Digital and a
bid by Microsoft to push its operating software into
workstations and the upper reaches of the computer market
where it has no presence today.

   The alliance with Digital "could change the equation in
the computer industry," Mr. Gates said in an interview.
   Mr. Gates said Microsoft will work with Digital to offer
Microsoft's next-generation operating system, Windows NT, on
Digital's Alpha chip design. Digital unveiled the chip
yesterday, saying it would power its computers into the next
century.
   The Digital-Microsoft alliance had been widely expected.
But Mr. Gates's comments were the first public confirmation
of what is apparently a widening collaboration. A spokesman
for Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., said the company is "in
serious negotiations" with Microsoft but wouldn't disclose
terms. "We aren't there yet," he said.
   Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., apparently hopes to
nurture development of a new industry standard in the
workstation market just as its DOS and Windows operating
software define the PC market. "If we can do that, we can
change the industry," Mr. Gates said. "Digital is a key
element in this."
   Digital said yesterday that its new chip will be more
powerful than the next-generation chips of Sun Microsystems
Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business Machines
Corp. The chip is based on reduced instruction-set computing,
or RISC, an advanced chip design.
   Digital also said it is in negotiations with other
computer makers to license the chip. Cray Research Inc. and
Japan's Kubota Ltd. have already announced that they will use
it in future products.
   Competitors have expressed skepticism about Digital's
claims for the performance of the new chip design. Bill Joy,
a senior Sun Microsystems engineer, said the effective power
of the chip will fall short of the peak speeds that Digital
has disclosed.
   Digital said the first version of the Alpha chip,
available in volume this summer, will deliver 150 Specmarks,
a common measure of computer power. Hewlett-Packard has said
it will deliver a 120 Specmark chip by the end of the year.
   In operating software, Microsoft is racing against an
advanced operating system for RISC chips under development by
IBM and Apple Computer Inc. under a joint venture called
Taligent. Microsoft is expected to deliver Windows NT by the
end of this year, at least a year ahead of the expected
Taligent offering. Microsoft is also trying to supplant Unix,
the industry standard operating software developed by
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. Unix dominates the
workstation market.
   Microsoft's first priority for Windows NT is the huge
market for PCs built around Intel Corp.'s microprocessors,
the highest-volume computer design. It has also said it will
make Windows NT available to a Digital-led consortium
centered on RISC chips designed by MIPS Computer Systems Inc.
   Digital said it will price the first of the new chips at
$1,559 for 1,000 or more. Bill Demmer, a Digital vice
president, said that a range of computers based on the chip
will be available by the end of this year. They will be aimed
first at power-hungry technical and scientific markets, with
commercial-class software and new models coming six months
later.
