   Hunters bagged 2,979 alligators and only reported
two minor injuries during Florida's first widespread gator hunt in
26 years.
   ``They did better than we thought, a fact probably attributed to
the number of experienced trappers who were enlisted to help,'' said
Mike Jennings, a wildlife biologist for the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission in Gainesville.
   Officials were pleased at the number of gators taken and the
safety record among the 230 hunters issued permits for the hunt,
which lasted throughout September.
   Only two minor injuries were reported. One man shot off his
finger with a ``bang stick'' on Lake George, and another was bitten
on the arm, according to a preliminary report on the hunt.
   Commission officials had predicted the hunters would kill 2,600
alligators, or about 75 percent of the 3,450 limit. The hunt was
called to promote interest in state wetlands and to trim the
alligator population, which has doubled since anti-poaching measures
were adopted in 1970.
   Jennings said regulations governing next year's hunt may be
altered following a study on the 28 areas in this year's harvest.
   The hunt will bring the total alligators killed this year to
about 8,000, said John White, a wildlife biologist with the
commission.
   Nuisance trappers, who kill alligators that threaten people,
destroy about 5,000 animals a year in Florida, where the animal's
population is estimated at 1 million.
   Louisiana has harvested more than 20,000 alligators every year
since 1971. In Texas, where hunts resumed in 1984, about 1,500
gators are taken annually.
   Despite the lure of profits for the gators, which can bring up to
$1,000 per foot in meat and hide, the riches came mostly in form of
memories.
   ``This was more for the experience than anything. It was a great
way to see the real Florida,'' said James Gelardi, whose 13-foot-4,
770-pound gator was the biggest caught during the hunt.
   ``I think the game commission did a great job,'' said Jimmy
Douglas, a Sumter County nuisance trapper who took his 15-gator
limit in 2{ nights.
   ``But this is the first year, when everybody was real cautious.
As time goes on people are going to get more careless,'' he said.
``I hear people saying already that getting a gator ain't nothing.
Well, I've seen a gator crush my fiberglass boat like it was paper.
All I can say is `Be careful.'''
