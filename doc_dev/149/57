<LEADPARA>  Microsoft Corp. on Monday unveiled three personal computer programs for people
who may be intimidated by high-powered spreadsheets, word processors and
desk-top publishing software.;   The world's largest maker of software for IBM
PCs and compatibles introduced Microsoft Publisher, Money and a new version of
Microsoft Works. All run under Microsoft's Windows operating system and are
aimed at small businesses and individuals who don't need -- or are frightened
by -- full-featured programs with four-pound instruction manuals.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said the products are part of his vision of
making computers accessible to nearly everyone.;   "This is what really drives
all of what we do," he said at a news conference in New York.;   Publisher is
a desk-top publishing program, Money handles personal finance, including
check-writing, and Works is all-in-one software that combines word processing,
spreadsheet, data-base, chart and drawing capabilities.;   The programs are
operated by a mouse, feature a lot of color and snazzy graphics, and have
extensive tutorials and other features to walk users through the hard parts.; 
 Among the innovations are "wizards," or design guides that automatically set
up common tasks such as a date book, basic spreadsheet, newsletter or business
form.;   In Publisher, there is even a feature that shows how to make paper
airplanes, which are printed out on paper complete with dotted lines
indicating fold marks.;   Microsoft has long offered full-featured software,
like its Excel spreadsheet and Word writing program, and brought out its first
version of Works in 1986. But this is its first major entry into the "low-end"
market.;   Gates said he believes the new software will be a hit as well.;  
"I think our timing is really excellent because now is the time when powerful,
low-cost computers are finding their way into mass distribution," he said. He
added that the software's release was timed to coincide with the Christmas
shopping season.;   Gates said he did not think the new software would
cannibalize sales of existing, more-powerful Microsoft products. "They are
really two different markets," he said.;   Robert Kleiber, an analyst with the
Minneapolis brokerage firm Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, agreed the new products
should do well.;   Works' list price is $199, Money's is $69.95, and
Publisher's is $199.  </TEXT>
