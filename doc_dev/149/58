   The computer industry will trot out new
products and crank up its promotion machine as the world's largest
annual computer show opens here Monday. But the hype may be
overshadowed by the looming recession.
   Computer sales have been slowing for several years. With the
economy as a whole entering a slump, the industry's outlook could
darken further.
   Domestic sales of personal computers fell about 25 percent in
September compared with the first eight months of the year,
according to Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   However, the economic downturn is not among the dozens of
industry and technical topics scheduled for panel discussions
during the show, called Comdex Fall. In typical trade-show fashion,
the official patter will be upbeat.
   Among issues that will be addressed by industry experts are
multimedia computing, or the use of video, photographs and
animation on computers; a related technology called image
processing; portable computers; and business opportunities in the
``new Europe.''
   The keynote speaker is Bill Gates, the young chairman of
software powerhouse Microsoft Corp. Gates is scheduled to talk
Monday about the evolution of personal computing and its future.
   Gates' company has been in the news this year for its software
that gives International Business Machines Corp. computers and
compatible models many of the ease-of-use features of Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh. Microsoft says it has sold more than 1
million copies of the Windows 3 software since its June
introduction.
   Also scheduled to speak is Gilbert Hyatt, an engineer who in
July was granted a patent for his work in developing the
microprocessor. The patent award called into question the computer
industry's official history, which says the computer-on-a-chip was
invented by several Intel Corp. scientists.
   One of the more important bits of news expected at Comdex won't
be announced at a flashy news conference. Instead, semiconductor
maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will give private demonstrations
of its new product, a clone of Intel's extremely popular 386
microprocessor.
   The 386 chip is the brains of an increasing number of IBM
personal computers and compatible models. AMD says its chip is even
better than the original.
   However, the company doesn't plan a full-scale announcment at
the show because it has not set the price or availability date for
the chip, said AMD spokesman David Frink.
   Apart from the panel discussions, one of the major attractions
of Comdex to those in the industry are the acres and acres of
computer products on display. Among the more intriguing devices
will be tiny personal computers called notepads and other portable
computers that recognize handwriting.
   Comdex is billed as the nation's largest annual trade show. It
virtually takes over Las Vegas this week, with 118,000
conventioneers overflowing hotel rooms and more than 1,800 product
exhibitors from 22 countries cramming onto display floors at the
Las Vegas Convention Center and five hotels.
   The 12-year-old gathering is a forum for major computer makers
to attract new distributors for their products. It also is used by
tiny startup companies to gain a foothold in the vast computer
market.
   Though the show is aimed primarily at computer sellers, it draws
computer experts and insiders of all sorts, from trade letter
editors to Wall Street analysts. About 1,800 members of the press
are expected, organizers say.
   However, Comdex appears to be losing some of its luster as a
place for computer companies to make major announcements, some
observers say.
   ``You get lost in the noise,'' said Esther Dyson, publisher of
the computer newsletter Release 1.0 and a Comdex veteran. Plus, she
added, with the growth of other computer industry gatherings,
``It's no longer THE big event of the year.
   ``The industry is getting less cohesive. There are so many
different parts and interest groups,'' she said.
