To comprehend the computer industry, it was once essential to understand
International Business Machines, hardware manufacturer par excellence and
industry leader for three decades.
Today, with IBM fighting red ink and loss of market share, the model is
Microsoft, the aggressive young pretender to IBM's crown. Creator of MS/Dos
and Windows, the operating systems which control more than 90 per cent of
the world's personal computers, the company has begun to influence others in
a way reminiscent of its older rival.
Microsoft, however, is living in a changed world and the management and
strategic challenges are correspondingly different. While IBM wanted total
control of its customer, Microsoft is increasingly focusing on what it
believes it does best, designing and producing quality software. As Steve
Ballmer, responsible for the company's sales and marketing activities,
points out: 'We cannot do everything. As a result, to reach large businesses
we will have to forge relationships with new business partners - not just
the distributors we have always dealt with, but companies developing
specific software solutions to their customers' problems.'
Microsoft's management philosophy, explains Ballmer, is 'ultimately
conservative'. Much of this is rooted in the personality of Bill Gates,
Microsoft's 38-year-old co-founder, chairman and chief executive, whose
parsimony and competitiveness are equally notorious. But Ballmer, a
37-year-old college friend of Gates and effectively Microsoft's joint number
two, is clearly a thoughtful and assertive influence.
'When I started (in 1980), Microsoft had 30 people. When I had been there
two months, I told Bill I thought we ought to hire 17 more people. He said:
'I think we are going to go bankrupt if I keep you here. I'm not sure this
is going to work out'.'
Ballmer stayed and Microsoft did not go bankrupt. The success of its
operating systems on IBM-style PCs, its computer languages and applications
programs turned it into the world's most successful packaged software
supplier. Last year it had sales of Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.6bn), up 36 per
cent on the year before and net income of Dollars 953m.
The changing marketplace will test both its adaptability and technical
expertise. Microsoft has proved itself the king of the electronic desktop,
providing operating systems, word processors and spreadsheets for people
using stand-alone personal computers. But as large companies seek to link
their computers together and establish enterprise-wide information networks,
how will the company react?
Windows NT, Microsoft's latest operating system, is the company's
technological answer, but Microsoft, as Ballmer readily agrees, has less
experience of corporate data processing than, for example, IBM or Unisys.
Ballmer says Microsoft has more experience than many people realise, but
adds: 'I am not convinced that IBM or Unisys - where one company supplied
hardware, software and services - is the model for the 1990s. In our model
we focus on what we do best, which is to build software products. Others
build hardware, deliver services and design custom developments.
'We have to mobilise an infrastructure around our products or people will
not design them into their systems. We have to explain that model to our
corporate customers. We are not going to be a cradle-to-grave supplier. If
people want a company to integrate their hardware or write a custom
application, that company is not going to be us.'
Can Microsoft, however, continue to dominate the software business and avoid
'doing an IBM'?
As Ballmer tells it - his style is engagingly direct, the decibel count
unusually high - the company can hardly be accused of complacency. He
describes a culture which reflects a nervous, almost paranoid concern with
staying ahead. 'We are certainly paranoid enough about the potential to fail
that we are looking very hard for the potholes in the road.'
Having Gates around evidently helps. 'Bill is good at saying: 'I don't care
how good things seem to most people. I see deep problems',' explains
Ballmer.
Conscious of the technological obsolescence pothole into which IBM stumbled,
Microsoft has one senior employee (Nathan Mirvald, vice-president of
advanced technology) constantly scanning the horizon for new business
threats.
Ballmer distinguishes three phases in the company's development. The first
was characterised by a focus on technology and on business ('before you hire
anyone or do anything, get a customer'), but there was little management
vision. 'Bill had all these envelopes with all the contracts written down
and everybody in the company and their salaries and he was doing these
calculations over and over to make sure there was enough of this to cover
that,' Ballmer recalls.
In the second phase, Jon Shirley of Tandy Corporation was hired to inject
some business sense into a technologically aggressive company which was
being strangled by tight purse strings. 'Jon helped us grow the management
structure that enabled us to do the investing that I wanted and that Paul
Allen, Microsoft's co-founder, wanted. It was what Bill wanted to do as well
but he did not have the confidence.'
Shirley has since retired, although he keeps in close contact with the
company. A replacement did not work out and the company established an
'office of the president' last year to support Gates. It comprised Ballmer
as head of sales, Mike Maples, head of the products group, and the late
Frank Gaudette, who had been chief financial officer.
The challenge now, Ballmer says, is how best to present a unified approach
to its customers, while allowing the separate divisions considerable
autonomy. 'We spend a lot of time pushing ourselves. How do we become a
global company? How do we measure the effectiveness of a sales operation
when we are working with partners? If there is a price war you don't want to
be the guy caught with higher overheads and processing costs than others
because you've been sloppy.'
Microsoft's success has made a lot of its employees potentially very rich
through share options and that has helped to maintain the youthful
aggression of the culture: 'Any senior executive at Microsoft can retire if
they want to. The nice thing about having people make money is that they
don't stick around unless they want to,' Ballmer says. 'They stick around
because they want to work hard and are excited about what we are doing. It
is a nice filtering process.'
He and Gates, he says, are good for at least another 10 years. 'We don't
work as hard as we used to, but we still work very hard and we love it.'
