   The killing of a 4-year-old girl by an alligator
triggered a rash of reports of the reptiles near homes in Florida,
and a wildlife officer said Monday he's now quicker to fulfill
requests to have the animals killed.
   Meanwhile, another wildlife official warned people not to take
vigilante action against the usually harmless animals after a report
that a woman living near the site where the girl was killed attacked
a small alligator.
   Lt. Dick Lawrence of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission said he's stopped trying to explain to people complaining
about alligators that attacks by the animals are extremely rare.
   ``Extremely rare doesn't mean a damn thing with what happened
this weekend,'' said Lawrence, alligator coordinator for the game
commission in a 10-county Everglades region.
   Lawrence, who issues permits to have state-designated trappers
kill troublesome alligators, said his office received 80 complaints
about alligators Monday, four or five times the normal number,
following the death Saturday of young Erin Glover in Englewood.
   The child was splashing through shallow water along the shore of
a lake near her home when a 10{-foot alligator grabbed her. Her
31-pound body was recovered more than five hours later after game
officers shot and killed the alligator.
   ``When people see an alligator, especially now, all they see is
the mouthful of teeth and ugliness,'' Lawrence said.
   ``I think there'll be more permits issued, but the kills may not
go up. The trapper may go out there in a day or two, and the gator's
not there.''
   Game officials received a report Monday that a woman living near
the site of the fatal attack ``bashed a 3-foot gator's head in,''
said game commission Lt. Jim Farrior. Officials could not confirm
the report.
   Farrior said alligators that small eat only minnows, frogs and
snakes, and he cautioned people against taking violent action
against gators.
   ``I think the vigilante response is not a good response. It's
ineffective,'' he said. ``You can't go out on a rampage and start
killing every gator out there.''
   Wildlife officials will not change their policy for handling
nuisance alligators, Farrior said. They will kill alligators more
than 4 feet long if they are aggressive toward people, pets or
livestock or show a lack of fear toward humans.
   Lawrence said people who live near ponds, canals and lakes need
not panic if they spot an alligator.
   Including Erin's death, alligators have killed six people and
engaged in 95 unprovoked attacks in Florida since 1948, according to
game commission statistics.
   ``Generally, if you leave alligators alone, they'll leave you
alone,'' he said.
   Franklin Percival, wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Gainesville, said people probably were
overreacting to Erin's death, but he added that it's important to
respect alligators.
   ``You're just really asking for it when you're dealing with a
wild animal at close range. You have to keep your distance,'' he
said.
   Alligators have been a protected species in Florida since the
mid-1960s, when their population dwindled after years of vigorous
hunting.
   But in recent years their population has rebounded dramatically,
with state wildlife experts estimating there are 1 million
alligators on 6.7 million acres. On Sept. 1, for the first time
since 1962, the state will hold a one-month gator hunt in which up
to 3,000 will be taken.
