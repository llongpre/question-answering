   Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates today
outlined his vision of the futuire of personal computers in which
the desktop machines will provide access to almost unlimited
information.
   In the keynote address at the giant Comdex computer show, Gates
described a future in which computers are vastly more useful and
easier to use.
   Gates, whose company developed the most widely used operating
system for personal computers, outlined new technology that will
bring video, voice and handwriting recognition capability to
personal computers.
   ``This is a formidable challenge. No single company is going to
be able to do this,'' he said.
   Gates called for cooperation among computer hardware and
software companies to bring about his vision which he calls
``information at your fingertips.''
   In an amusing series of videos on a giant screen, Gates depicted
how computers containing these new technologies would be used in a
mythical town of Twin Points, a spoof of the TV series ``Twin
Peaks.''
   He showed how a deliveryman used a handheld computer that
recognized handwriting to enter orders, how students at a school
could use a computer much like an encyclopedia today and how a
couple building a house could ``walk through'' their a
three-dimensional model of their proposed home on a computer
screen.
   Gates said these new technologies are not some science fiction
dream but are all under development or are already in use.
   Gates' speech kicked off a weeklong Comdex show that promoters
say attracted about 120,000 computer retailers, distributors and
other industry people.
