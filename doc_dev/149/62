FT  08 MAR 94 / Gates scorns most multimedia trials

Mr Bill Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's largest
personal computer software company, yesterday poured cold water on the value
of most of the 'multi-media' trials in the US and Europe.
Describing the current flush of interest in multimedia as a form of
collective mania, he predicted that trials based on home entertainment would
prove to be dead ends and would be counter-productive to the establishment
of a viable multimedia industry.
Multimedia and 'information superhighway' are descriptions of developments
expected to lead to the delivery of a range of interactive services and
information to the office and the home through a single channel - a
telephone line, for example.
Multimedia has generated considerable attention over the past six months as
companies in the entertainment, communications and computer sectors have
formed expensive alliances to exploit the possibilities.
Mr Gates, believed to be the richest man in the US and with a record as a
technology forecaster, said many of the companies experimenting with
multimedia were misguided in concentrating on single services, such as
'video-on-demand', rather than a broad range, and on the home rather than
business. 'Video-on-demand' implies that customers will be able to select
videos of their choice from an electronic library and have them delivered to
their television sets.
'The first place for widespread usage of this technology will be in
business. It will involve low-cost video conferencing, electronic mail and
group networking. Once business is using multimedia, then we can move to the
home environment.'
'He expected early pilots to be disappointing. 'The revenues generated and
the usage will not justify the huge infrastructure costs.'
Mr Gates, in the UK to talk to British Telecommunications among others about
multimedia collaboration, was speaking only a week after the start of
largest video-on-demand trial, organised by Time Warner, the US cable
television organisation, was postponed until the autumn.
Mr Gates' comments must be seen in the light of Microsoft's ambitions to set
the agenda in multimedia, in which it is investing some Dollars 100m a year.
It has announced that it will test its software in collaboration with
Tele-Communications, the largest US cable operator. Mr Gates said Microsoft
would begin testing home multimedia services in the US and Europe in 1995.
He did not expect substantial returns on the investment for five years.
