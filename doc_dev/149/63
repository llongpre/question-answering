   Airboats fanned out over Lake Okeechobee
for the first statewide alligator hunt in 26 years, a 30-day
reprieve aimed at thinning out the once endangered species whose
thick hides fetch $42 a foot.
   ``We could have filled our 15-gator limit tonight,'' Warren
Schafer boasted about four hours after the hunting season opened
Thursday night. He displayed his prey: three gators ranging from
seven to 10 feet long.
   ``It wasn't as hard as other animals I've hunted,'' said
Schafer, 45, of Miami, a veteran big-game hunter.
   Across Florida starting at sundown, more than 200 hunters
selected by the state began to search for their red-eyed prey with
flashlights and head lamps.
   Harpoons, snares and bows and arrows are about the only weapons
permitted. Most alligators are taken alive, their jaws secured with
duct tape, and are delivered to processing plants still kicking.
Some are killed with a ``bang-stick,'' a device that shoots a
cartridge on impact. Guns are prohibited because the gators often
sink after being shot.
   On Lake Okeechobee, hunters, reporters and a few sightseers
departed under the din of airboats and through a mist churned up by
their large propellers. Bugs fluttered about like snowflakes in the
hunters' lights.
   Thomas Alpern, 25, a free-lance writer from New York City, said
to be the only Northerner who received a permit, was still
searching for his first alligator at midnight with the aid of a
professional trapper.
   ``Who knows?'' he said. ``Maybe I won't even be able to kill it
once we find one.''
   But Alpern, like many hunters, couldn't ignore the profitable
side of the hunt. In addition to the lucrative hides, gator meat
sells for up to $6 a pound.
   ``The money is the big factor,'' said Rodney Crawford, a
19-year-old cook from Lake Worth, who will hunt on Lake George in
Florida.
   State game officers are closely monitoring the hunt for poachers
and permit-holders using illegal weapons or taking gators below the
4-foot minimum length.
   Since federal anti-poaching methods were adopted in 1970, the
alligator population in Florida has about doubled to an estimated 1
million. Nearly 1,000 gators have been captured in experimental
hunts since 1981, and the September season will be isolated to 28
districts where the alligator population is extraordinarily high.
   Tom Stice, a biologist with the state Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission, said a cross section of the public was sought for the
hunt to expand interest in alligators.
   The 238 hunters, selected from about 5,000 applications,
attended a six-hour, state-sponsored training session and signed
liability waivers.
   Stice estimated the hunters will capture 65 to 70 percent of the
possible maximum of 3,450.
   For state wildlife officials, the hunt follows a nearly 20-year
effort to preserve the Florida alligator, which averages about 10
feet in length.
   The last state-approved hunt for sport was in 1962, when the
American alligator was declared endangered and hunting alligators
in Florida was banned. As its numbers increased, however, officials
downgraded the alligator from endangered to threatened and the
state gradually relaxed hunting restrictions.
   ``People are getting gator phobia,'' said Lee Kramer of Delray
Beach, who captures nuisance alligators for the state. ``I got a
call the other day in Boca (Raton) and it turned out to be an
inflatable pool alligator that blew into a ditch.''
   Allan Woodward, head of alligator research for the game
commission, theorized that the alligator population was not as
decimated as previously thought during the height of poaching in
the 1960s.
   ``They've really surprised us,'' he said. ``They're a pretty
hardy animal.''
