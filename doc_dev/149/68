   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is still a billionaire, but for a while there yesterday he was reduced to mere multimillionaire status. 

   Shares of Microsoft came under heavy selling pressure Tuesday, falling 7 1/4 to 90 1/4 in a jittery market for technology stocks after analyst Brian Mutert of Robertson Colman cut his earnings estimates. 

   But other analysts rallied to defend the stock yesterday, bolstering the value of the 31-year-old Mr. Gates' 40% stake in the Redmond, Wash.-based software developer. 
After trading as low as 88 1/2, it rose 3 to finish at 93. 

   Ruthann Quindlen of Alex. 
Brown, one of two underwriters that took Microsoft public at $21 a share in March 1986, raised her estimates and reiterated her "very strong buy" recommendation. 

   Even Mr. Mutert took pains to note that his old estimates of $2.80 for fiscal 1987, which ended June 30, and $4.70 for fiscal 1988 were "pretty aggressive," and that his revised projections of $2.70 and $4.30 are "still above the rest of the Street." 

   Microsoft executives were less charitable. 
"He was in the ozone," said Frank Gaudette, Microsoft's chief financial officer. 
However, other company officials had indicated privately they considered the stock fully priced when it soared into the stratosphere in early May. 

   From a 52-week low of 26, Microsoft shares nearly quintupled to a peak closing price of 126 1/2 reached May 8, ranking the stock as one of the great stories of the current bull market. 

   Behind the move: strong sales of personal computer clones that also use the PC operating system Microsoft developed for International Business Machines, and IBM's decision to use Microsoft software in its new PC line. 

   However, technology stocks have taken a beating in the past month, and Microsoft's 26% pullback is typical. 
But it turns out that Mr. Gates is just as much a wizard at stock market timing as he is in software development. 
He started selling shares May 7, the day before the price peaked. 

   Mr. Gates became a billionaire in the middle of the stock's big move. 
On March 19, his then 42% stake of 11,018,955 shares crossed the magic number of $90.75. 
Between May 7 and May 20 he sold 520,000 shares at an average price of $111.25, or $57.9 million. 

   Assuming Mr. Gates hasn't frittered the money away and instead put it into assets that have held the same value -- an assumption that will get shakier with the passage of time -- his remaining 10,498,955 shares must be worth $942.1 million, or $89.70 a share, for him to remain a billionaire. 

   Mr. Mutert notes that investors have become accustomed to Microsoft "blowing out the numbers on the upside" or exceeding analysts' expectations in its quarterly earnings reports, and have been valuing the stock "based on a continuation of that trend." 
But now he believes the risk is on the downside. 

   With second-quarter PC software business down 5% to 10% from the March quarter and third-quarter prospects uncertain due to customer confusion about the new IBM line, the Roberston Colman analyst says, "there is going to be an unusual lack of visibility at a time when investors needed some comfort." 

   Ms. Quindlen of Alex. 
Brown believes Microsoft stock rose above 115 merely on the false hope there might be a stock split that would make the issue more accessible to retail investors. 

   Yesterday she raised her estimates for fiscal 1987 to $2.85 to $2.90 a share from her previous estimate of $2.80, and for fiscal 1988 to $3.80 to $4 from $3.60. 

   She says the universe of computer stocks she follows are, even after the recent pullback, still trading at a multiple of 21 times earnings expected in the next four quarters. 
Although Microsoft now trades at 24 times the midpoint of her current estimate, she believes it should trade at "at least 30 times," or $117. 
She calls Microsoft "a premium company in a near monopoly situation." 

   Those who have sold Microsoft in the recent past point to another lofty multiple of price to sales. 
John Wilke, a money manager at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis, says he makes it a rule to sell stocks selling at over four times sales. 
Microsoft is selling at about six times its current sales rate. 

   Elaine Goldberg, manager of the Fidelity software and services fund, says that Microsoft is more vulnerable to a change in market psychology than its main software competitors because Microsoft sells at a higher price-earnings multiple. 
"I don't think the story has changed since the beginning of the quarter in March. 
If you liked it then, you've got to like it here."
