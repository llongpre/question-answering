The days of the humble television set are numbered. Within a few years, it
will be supplanted in the home and office by the personal computer - albeit
in modified form - which is set to become the principal vehicle for the
multimedia revolution.
Who says so? Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, for one. He predicts that homes
will soon have at least two PCs capable of displaying multimedia programmes.
The first, shorn of its keyboard and boasting a large screen will live in
the lounge. It will combine still and moving images, sound, text and
graphics and the service will be interactive - video on demand or three
dimensional computer games are typical examples.
'Then there will be a device in your den for when you want to browse for
shopping or do your personal finances. You will sit less than a metre from
it and it will have a keyboard and a superior ability to display text,' he
says.
Gates' plan is that Windows, the operating software that has been a
principal key to Microsoft's position as software market leader, will
control both these PCs.
The drawback to date, however, has been that PCs, sharp though they are at
arithmetic, are pretty much dunces where it comes to displaying video
images. They are simply not designed to handle or store the sheer volume of
information contained in a moving picture. Thus, video sequences in
multimedia presentations are limited to a postage stamp sized area of the
screen. Any attempt to enlarge the image causes a sharp loss of quality and
fidelity.
Now, Videologic, of Kings Langley on the outskirts of London, claims to have
an answer to the problem. It has developed a set of silicon chips capable of
taking digitised video images and displaying them on a PC screen - full
size, offering cinema quality motion and fully compatible with Gates'
Windows. And the cost of the chips should be no more than Dollars 25 in
quantity - in other words, chips for a mass market.
The company's claim should be taken seriously for a number of reasons.
First, because it is already the world leader in an earlier form of PC
video. In 1988 it developed chips which overlaid video pictures on a PC
screen, by passing the central processor and memory. The new chips, however,
mix the digits representing video, text and graphics in the computer's
memory, something, Videologic says, no other company has yet accomplished.
It is a cheaper solution and it makes it possible for the computer to
manipulate any part or aspect of the video picture, something that was
impossible with the earlier technology.
Second, because it has some very powerful partners including International
Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, British
Telecom and Motorola, a leading US semiconductor manufacturer. Its agreement
with IBM covers the joint design, development and marketing of multimedia
products. Videologic has, however, retained its intellectual property
rights.
Third, because the company already has a raft of blue chip customers,
including Microsoft, the Bank of England, Deutsche Bank and the John Lewis
Partnership.
According to Derek Maclaren, chairman, the company has a six-month lead on
the competition protected by patents, knowledge and an adherence to industry
standards others have yet to emulate. The concepts are difficult to grasp,
especially for a consumer product. so Videologic is selling its flagship
product, '928Movie' as a way of speeding up Windows graphics with, it says,
'multimedia for free'.
