<LEADPARA>  VISIONARY is a word often applied to both Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates
and "Megatrends" author John Naisbitt, both of whom spoke at a multimedia
computing conference in San Jose Monday. But listening to the two made it
clear that the vision thing can get a bit cloudy.;    Naisbitt, who was to
talk about the role of optical storage in the Information Age, said the "big
story" of the 1990s would not be high tech, but rather a "renaissance in the
arts, literature and in spirituality." He said the arts had already replaced
sports as a dominant form of entertainment, claiming Americans spent $1
billion more on arts events last year than on sporting contests.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Gates, whose speech was about how multimedia computing would revolutionize
life in the 1990s, said afterward that he couldn't figure out how Naisbitt got
his numbers, unless he considered movies and video rentals to be part of "the
arts." He also disputed Naisbitt's claim that the bulk of U.S. exports came
from companies of fewer than 50 employees.;    But Gates himself set some in
the audience wondering about what kind of revolution he was talking about in
his address. When he demonstrated Microsoft's new electronic book of
quotations, Gates flipped through several until he settled one from a famous
revolutionary: Karl Marx.; (hbox);    CHIP'S APOLLO PROJECT: In an attempt to
find a "technology road map" for the future, the National Advisory Committee
on Semiconductors will host a meeting April 23-25 in Raleigh, N.C. The
industry's greatest minds will convene to decide what semiconductor technology
the United States should focus on in an effort to "leapfrog" Japanese
competitors by the end of the decade. After picking a target, the committee
then hopes to structure a national effort to achieve it, similar to the Apollo
space program in the late 1960s. According to sources, one technology under
discussion at the meeting will be a 1-gigabit static, random-access memory, or
SRAM, chip that would be 1,000 times more powerful than state-of-the-art chips
today.; (hbox);    BINARY AMBITION: Washington lobbyist Michael Maibach
apparently just can't get enough of politics. Maibach, who is director of
government affairs for Santa Clara chip maker Intel, is thinking of throwing
his hat into the ring for Congress. Maibach would like to run for seat Tom
Campbell, R-Sunnyvale, is vacating to run for the Senate. Maibach says he is
still trying to work out how to do his job for Intel, his lobbying for the
Semiconductor Industry Association and find the time to campaign. But insiders
say that may not be Maibach's biggest challenge. He is a well-known presence
on the Hill but spends only about one week a month in a Peninsula apartment,
so he is not well-known locally. On the other hand, with his knowledge of
high-technology issues, Maibach probably wouldn't have trouble raising money
in Silicon Valley.; (hbox);    BITING THE APPLE: Steve Jobs, former Silicon
Valley enfante terrible, has apparently decided to settle down. Monday, Jobs,
36, co-founder of Apple Computer and Next Inc., married Laurene Powell, 27, an
MBA student at Stanford University, at Yosemite National Park. Steve isn't the
only one with a high-powered resume. Powell studied at the Sorbonne, graduated
from the University of Pennsylvania and worked for Goldman, Sachs and Merrill
Lynch Asset Management. She also has the entrepreneurial spirit, founding a
company during her Penn years that sold care packages and birthday cakes to
parents and delivered them to students during finals.  </TEXT>
