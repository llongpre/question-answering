FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM and Microsoft settle PC
software dispute

IBM and Microsoft have reached an agreement on software licensing and patent
royalties that resolves a long-running dispute over personal computer
operating system software.
The agreement between IBM and Microsoft has been dubbed a 'divorce
settlement' because it ends almost two years of acrimony which began when
the companies chose different paths towards the development of a new
generation of PC software.
IBM and Microsoft had worked closely together since IBM chose Microsoft's
'DOS' program for its original PC 12 years ago. The companies went on to
collaborate in the development of a new operating system, called OS/2.
However, the first version was a flop and Microsoft chose to pursue
development of its own 'Windows' program while eventually dropping its
efforts to improve OS/2.
Windows has since become become a huge success, with sales of over 10m
copies. IBM, which continued work on OS/2 alone, recently launched a much
improved version of the operating system which, according to IBM, is selling
strongly although in smaller numbers.
Microsoft is expected to launch a new version of Windows, Windows Net
Technology, later this year, that will compete head-on with IBM's OS/2.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chief executive, has been scathing in his criticism
of IBM, while IBM executives, although more restrained, have been unable to
hide their annoyance over the embarrassing split.
The companies have now agreed to license each other to use IBM's OS/2 and
Microsoft's Windows programs until the end of 1993. The companies have also
entered into a long-term patent licensing agreement.
Other terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Microsoft is believed
to be paying IBM about Dollars 20m for rights to the computer giant's
extensive patent portfolio, which includes basic software technology.
Microsoft is the first large software company to reach a patent
cross-licence agreement with IBM, raising the prospect that IBM may seek
fees from other software publishers.
The battle between Microsoft and IBM has caused confusion among PC buyers
and throughout the PC software industry, so the resolution of the dispute
will benefit all, the companies claimed.
'With these agreements behind us, we will both be free to continue with our
individual business strategies to meet our customers' needs,' said Mr Lee
Reiswig Jr, the IBM executive in charge of personal computer software.
Mr Bernard Pache, the new chief executive of Groupe Bull, the loss-making
French computer manufacturer, yesterday confirmed the company's strategic
alliance with IBM. The US group is paying FFr540m (Dollars 7.51m), or FFr48
a share, for a 5.68 per cent stake in Bull.
