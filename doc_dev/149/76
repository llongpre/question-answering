Mr Bill Gates and Mr Craig McCaw, two of America's richest technology
entrepreneurs, set out yesterday on an ambitious space odyssey: the creation
of a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) global satellite communications system by the
year 2001. The two billionaires, each using 'a few million dollars' as seed
capital, aim to launch a fleet of 840 small satellites into orbit about 400
miles above the earth. The system would offer wireless data, video and voice
communications services worldwide.
The plan, however, faces technical and commercial doubts as well as daunting
financial and political hurdles.
Mr Gates, aged 38, is co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's
biggest software company. Mr McCaw, 44, built McCaw Cellular Communications
into the largest US cellular telephone company. It is now being sold to AT&amp;T
for Dollars 12.6bn.
Mr Gates, Mr McCaw and McCaw Cellular each will own 30 per cent of
Teledesic, the new venture. Mr McCaw is chairman, but Mr Gates does not hold
an executive position. Microsoft itself is not involved.
Teledesic revealed its plans yesterday by applying to the Federal
Communications Commission for permission to begin construction of the
satellite system.
Using very high frequency transmissions, the refrigerator-sized satellites
would send and receive digital signals from telephone directory-sized
receivers and small antennas installed in homes and businesses. Each
satellite would, in effect, be a telephone switching system.
The small satellites could be launched in clusters, reducing the cost.
However, low-orbit satellites tend to fall out of their orbits far quicker
than the 22,300-mile-high geostationary satellites now used for telephone
communications. They must therefore be replaced more frequently, adding to
the cost of maintaining the system.
Teledesic has yet to begin raising the Dollars 9bn needed to build the
satellite system. It aims to draw together a broad alliance of
manufacturers, telecommunications companies and governments to back the
massive effort.
Teledesic faces competition from less expensive satellite projects such as
Motorola's Iridium, which will provide mobile communications to car drivers.
