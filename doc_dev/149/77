   Microsoft Corp.'s Windows computer
software will be installed on as many as 40,000 personal computers
being purchased by the Federal Aviation Administration over the
next eight years, Microsoft said Thursday.
   Microsoft is a subcontractor to AT&amp;T in the contract with the
federal Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA. But
the Redmond-based company said its participation was crucial in
selection of the AT&amp;T bid for the air control agency's Office
Automation Technology Services contract.
   ``We believe the FAA made its selection based in large part on
the clear and demonstrable productivity increases that users
realize when working in the Windows environment,'' said Bill Gates,
chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft. ``This award
signals (the government's) recognition of Windows as a complete
solution for increased productivity.''
   The Transportation Department awarded the contract, potentially
worth $853 million, to AT&amp;T last month. The value of the
subcontract to Microsoft was not disclosed.
   Windows and two other Microsoft products, Excel for Windows and
Word for Windows, were included in the bids. Excel is a spreadsheet
program and Word is for word processing.
   Windows provides a graphical, or picture, display to manipulate
the software, rather than requiring users to type in characters to
operate the software.
   Seventy companies worked with AT&amp;T on the contract bid,
Microsoft said.
