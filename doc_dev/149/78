A RADICALLY different information technology industry will emerge over the
next few years through consolidation in the semi-conductor business and the
disintegration of the traditional computer industry.
This was the view of industry leaders speaking yesterday at a major industry
conference in Barcelona. The Etre conference brings together leading figures
from the industry each year for two days of discussions and presentations.
Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microfsoft, the world's largest personal computer
software company, said that within three years software houses would no
longer market complete applications programs as at present. Instead, they
would develop pieces of software which could be connected together into
complex systems.
He predicted that within a few years, 90 per cent of personal computers
would have Microsoft's best-selling Windows program built in. The latest
development in Microsoft's family of Windows operating systems, codenamed
Cairo, would emerge from the laboratory in 18 months, he said. The new
system would have advanced features such as voice and handwriting
recognition built in.
Mr Gates said that developments in the computer industry would lead to an
information-rich society in which individuals might have to take explicit
steps to avoid bombardment with data. He said aeroplanes, hotels and theme
parks were the obvious candidates for sites where people could be supplied
with virtually unlimited information.
Mr Jerry Sanders, chief executive of AMD, a US semi-conductor company,
warned there would be no place for small, independent semi-conductor
companies in the volume IT markets of the late-1990s. He said the costs of
research and development coupled with the expense of building plants capable
of manufacturing chips with features smaller than half a millionth of a
metre meant that only the largest companies like Intel and AMD would be left
to fight it out.
