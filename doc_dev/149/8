<LEADPARA>  Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates, the second-richest man in the United
States, shared some of his wealth today by donating $12 million to the
University of Washington.;   The gift will be used to create a department of
molecular biotechnology at the college's medical school and to hire noted
immunologist Leroy Hood of the California Institute of Technology as the
department's first chairman.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Gates' donation also will be used to set up an intellectual venture capital
fund that will provide seed money for university scientists in molecular
biotechnology research.;   Molecular biotechnology is the study of DNA and
other major building blocks of life. Scientists are researching ways to modify
these building blocks to identify and treat diseases and other medical
problems.;   Gates' donation is the largest ever to the university, eclipsing
the $11 million donated three years ago by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.;  
Gates told a news conference that biotechnology is one of his chief interests
in addition to computers. Gates has invested in a small biotech company, ICOS
Corp. of Seattle, but he said that company won't be directly involved with the
university.;   Gates, 35, did not attend the University of Washington, but his
mother, Mary Gates, is a regent of the university and a member of the board of
its medical center.;   The most recent issue of Forbes magazine lists Gates as
the second-richest man in America, with an estimated worth of $4.8 billion --
a fortune he made as Microsoft became the world's biggest maker of computer
software.  </TEXT>
