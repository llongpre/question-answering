for PCs in the house

Microsoft wants to get into your home. The world's largest personal computer
software company has announced an ambitious strategy to accelerate its
participation in the home computer market and to change the way computers
are used in the home.
The company has launched a new brand to handle this task - Microsoft Home -
and says that the home computer products to be sold under the brand already
contribute Dollars 200m (Pounds 134.2m) in annual revenues to Microsoft. The
company's chairman and co-founder Bill Gates predicts dramatic further
growth in this sector.
He cites a recent survey by the Connecticut-based Inteco Corporation - which
revealed that more than 27 per cent of US homes already have at least one
PC, and that 31 per cent plan to buy one. In homes where children are of
school age the percentage jumps to 62 per cent. These figures also show that
5.5m homes plan to buy a PC in the next year.
All this is fertile ground for Microsoft, which has until now only toyed
with the home market through a diverse range of products. The company
currently has some 35 software titles for home users, but plans to expand
that to more than 100 within the next year.
Microsoft has formed partnerships with banks, educational institutions and
even parent-teacher associations to develop and promote new applications for
home computers.
In the short term, the most important of these will be what Microsoft calls
'edutainment' packages - which teach children new skills, introduce them to
new ideas and help them to absorb information by playing games and creating
stories and pictures. Such software includes electronic encyclopaedias,
reference works about everything from dinosaurs to Beethoven, and children's
creativity applications.
A vital technological key to the success of these developments is Compact
Disc Read Only Memory (CD-Rom). This is a storage medium based on the same
compact disc technology as used in stereo equipment, but storing huge
amounts of computer data (up to 600Mb - or about 400 times the amount
available on the average computer floppy disc). It allows software producers
a low-cost way of offering 'multimedia' applications that can hold hundreds
of pictures, film clips, spoken words and music.
Gates estimates that within 18 months, all popular makes of computer will be
shipped with CD-Rom drives and sound capabilities and predicts that more
than one million similarly equipped PCs will have been sold by the end of
this year.
Gates predicts that home computers will be more than just study aids for
children and has negotiated agreements with several financial services
companies to offer home banking services. Users will gain access to the
services through the Microsoft Money financial management software package.
All these products and services, however, are a prelude to the realisation
of a much broader vision of home computing that Gates has often outlined.
Microsoft is a stong proponent of the development of interactive telvision
and the so-called 'digital highway' under discussion in the US. Gates
suggests that as more homes use computers, and hook up to digital
information links, it will be only a matter of time before the computer,
telephone, television and on-line information services converge into a
single system for handling all home entertainment, education, information
and communication needs.
Microsoft could, however, face an uphill battle. To start with none of its
ideas on home computing are particularly new.
Microsoft also faces competition. California-based Intuit, for example, has
also made an agreement with the many US banks that have links to Visa.
And telecommunications giant AT&amp;T has announced that it, too, is entering
the home software business with plans to license home shopping software.
