The world's computer industry, still reeling from three years of recession,
seems set to enter a new, dramatically different, phase. That at any rate
seems to be the conviction of Mr Bill Gates, the restless and relentlessly
ambitious chairman of Microsoft, the world's largest and best known software
house.
In the past few months he has struck a series of deals with cable companies,
telecommunications companies and satellite organisations, which suggest he
wants his software applied in areas far removed from the personal computer
operating systems for which it is best known.
He has also instituted a company-wide reorganisation of Microsoft's sales
and marketing methods. And in what seems a spectacularly speculative move,
he is putting his own money into a venture with Mr Craig McCaw, developer of
the US's largest cellular telephone company, aimed at creating a global
satellite system for data communication.
Meanwhile, Novell, a smaller, less charismatic software house, has this week
struck a number of deals intended to transform it from the industry's
leading network specialist to a broad-based software house.
Novell's moves are fuelling speculation that Microsoft faces its first
serious challenger in a decade. Another view, however, is that Novell has
made its move too late.
Novell paid Dollars 1.4bn of its own stock for WordPerfect, another
Utah-based company which was once market leader in word processing software.
It also paid Borland International, another large US software developer,
Dollars 145m for its 'Quatro Pro' word processing software and the rights to
sell to Borland's database programs. The acquisition of WordPerfect gives
Novell combined revenues of about Dollars 1.9bn compared with Microsoft's
Dollars 3.75bn.
Novell's moves appear, in turn, to have acted as a spur to Microsoft.
Apparently driven by fears that the company was falling behind Novell and
other competitors in the software industry, including Lotus Development
Corporation and Electronic Arts, in marketing, sales and support strategies,
Mr Gates demanded more aggression and competitiveness from his employees.
The company needed to take decisions and act on them faster, he wrote: 'It
is better to take action, make mistakes and be forgiven than to wait and ask
for permission'. (Microsoft's competitors may feel this is rich from a
company currently under investigation by the US Justice Department for
alleged anti-competitive practices.)
Within days of Mr Gates' comments, Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman of
International Business Machines, the world's largest computer maker, set out
IBM's plans to fight horrendous losses and re-establish a role. (see below).
The impression created is of computer industry giants jostling for postion
in an increasingly competitive business. The problem each faces is that it
is unclear what strategy will prove most effective in the face of three
broad trends.
First, industry leaders expect hardware and software manufacturing to be
concentrated increasingly in the hands of a few large players.
Mr Benjamin Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer, which makes personal
computers, sees conventional mainframes and minicomputers being replaced by
networks of personal computers and powerful network 'servers' based on
increasingly sophisticated PC technology. IBM, Apple and Compaq represent
today's premier division; others will be hard put to displace them.
In the software market, Novell has this week reinforced its position among a
handful of large companies - Microsoft, Computer Associates, Oracle and
Lotus Development Corporation - intent on carving up the cake between them.
At the same time, consolidation is creating specialist powerhouses; the
leaders in desktop publishing Aldus Corporation and Adobe Systems have
agreed to merge, as have Electronic Arts and Broderbund Software, experts in
educational software.
There will be room, however, for small software houses, because as Mr Rosen,
a founding director of Lotus, the developer of the best-selling spreadsheet
1-2-3, says: 'Talented software designers do not like working for big
companies.'
Second, the spread of common standards and sophisticated software has
allowed the development of programs which integrate with other
manufacturers' systems. Here Novell is in a strong position, dominating the
market in networking software. It also owns the rights to Unix, networking
software originally developed for minicomputers which many believe ideal for
today's more powerful PCs to run company-wide networks.
Microsoft has until recently had only a token presence in networking
software. A new operating system it has developed called Windows NT, may
redress the balance.
Third, and possibly the most significant development, has been the emergence
of small and medium-sized companies and individuals as prime consumers of
personal computers and their software.
For the past 40 years the computer industry has supplied the data processing
business - the administrative systems of big companies. Now as hardware and
software prices fall rapidly, individuals and small organisations are buying
personal computers faster than big businesses.
This provides a powerful logic to Microsoft's recent acquisitions and
alliances. It is developing multimedia products with Tele-Communications,
the US cable operator; it bought Soft Image, creators of computer generated
scenes in the film Jurassic Park; this week it invested Dollars 30m in an
advanced wireless data network being built by Mobile Telecommunications
Technologies.
These acquisitions signify a determined move to provide and control the
software that will manage informations flows - business data, education,
news and entertainment - into the home and office. Microsoft's software
would become ubiquitous: controlling radio communications, cable and
satellite links as well as telecommunications lines and compact disks.
Mr Gates says there is usually an eight-year gap between him spotting an
opportunity and the profits flowing: 'For some reason, I think this will
happen faster than that'.
Novell's strategy is different. It is taking Microsoft on in the traditional
business of data processing. The rewards seem likely to be reasonable but
the possibilities are limited. If Mr Gates is right about the future of the
industry, Novell will have invested in the wrong market.
