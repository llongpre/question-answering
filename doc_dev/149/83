<TEXT>     The 1,000 images will be displayed on huge television screens that will be
installed throughout Gates' new waterfront mansion east of Seattle. Gates also
is looking for possible commercial uses of the images.;    Just as newspaper
tycoon William Randolph Hearst scoured the globe in search of art for his
mansion at San Simeon, computer tycoon Gates has conducted a search for art in
an exotic new form -- captured on a computer disk. His goal for the $5 million
house was 10,000 images of well-known paintings and photographs.;    Gates
started a company called Interactive Home Systems that has been negotiating
with museums and individuals nationwide to buy electronic rights to artwork
and still images. Any artwork that can be photographed can be digitized by a
computer scanner.;    TV screens in the house will be hooked up to advanced
computers tapping into a huge database containing the images.  </TEXT>
