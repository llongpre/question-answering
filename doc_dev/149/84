   Florida's first widespread alligator hunting season
in 26 years ends at midnight tonight, the last chance this year for
hunters to snare a large bull gator that can bring more than $1,000
for its hide and meat.
   The end of the 30-day season will give some a rest from stalking
or skinning.
   ``We've been going pretty much straight out all month. Now we're
going to add everything up and see if it was worth it,'' said Grant
Dunaway, whose processing plant near Immokalee received about 180
alligators caught by some of the 238 hunters, mostly novices who
won their permits in a state lottery.
   Dennis David, head of alligator monitoring for the state Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission, said hide prices on the
international market have remained stable at $40 to $44 a foot, but
the hunt dropped local gator meat prices about 25 percent to $4 to
$5 a pound.
   Wildlife officials aren't expected to have a final count on the
hunt, in which each hunter had a limit of 15 gators, until later
this year, but the original projection was of about 75 percent of
the maximum 3,570 gators.
   ``From what we can see so far, that seems to be a pretty good
guess,'' Dennis said.
   The impact of the hunt on the state's estimated 1 million
alligators will be studied and new rules for next year's hunt could
be adopted in January, Dennis said.
   Some of the possible revisions could be selecting new sites for
the hunt and loosening regulations to allow people without permits
to transport gators to processing facilities, said Dennis.
   The state established the hunt in response to a proliferation of
the once-threatened species. State wildlife experts credit strong
anti-poaching laws adopted in 1970 as the principal reason for a
twofold population growth in the past 20 years.
   The alligator was removed from the federal endangered species
list in 1977, and since 1981 the state has conducted experimental
hunts in selected areas with heavy gator populations.
   Several poachers were caught during the hunt, but most
infractions by permit holders were minor, including hunting outside
designated boundaries and failing to properly tag their catch.
   ``But for the most part we're quite pleased with the way the
hunt was handled,'' said Dennis. ``We didn't have anyone bitten
like people feared.''
   Most novice hunters hired experienced guides and only one
hunt-related injury has been reported since the season opened Sept.
1.
   A hunter on Lake George in northeast Florida lost part of a
finger when he accidentally discharged a bang-stick, a device that
fires a bullet on impact. Several airboats capsized, but no other
injuries were reported, said commission spokesman John White.
   In Louisiana, which opened its 17th annual 30-day season Sept.
10, 23,800 gators were taken last year. Texas, which resumed
alligator hunts in 1984, issued permits for 1,500 gators for the
16-day season that ended Sept. 18.
