MICROSOFT, the world's largest provider of software for personal computers,
yesterday reported a 52 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits of
Dollars 210.1m, or 48 cents a share.
The final quarter took Microsoft's earnings for its fiscal year to Dollars
708m, or Dollars 2.41 a share, well up on the Dollars 463m earned in fiscal
1991.
The strong fourth quarter was attributable to heavy demand for new versions
of the company's Windows operating system, Microsoft Excel for Windows, and
other applications for the system. Sales of applications for Windows almost
doubled in the final quarter against a year ago.
Mr Frank Gaudette, Microsoft's executive vice-president and chief financial
officer, said investments the company had made over the years in graphical
applications of Windows were paying off, and noted that for the full year
net income was a record 25.7 per cent of revenues.
Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, said the company would continue to
invest not just in its existing successful products, 'but in object
technology, consumer systems and in database and work group technology as
well'.
In its latest fiscal year Microsoft invested Dollars 352.2m in research and
development, compared with Dollars 235.4m in the previous year. Total
operating expenses in the year just completed, including Dollars 854.5m on
sales and marketing, reached Dollars 1.29bn, up 56 per cent on the preceding
12-month period.
