<LEADPARA>  IT'S IRONIC in a way that a man who dropped out of Harvard University would,
16 years later, decide that he should spend millions to fund a research
laboratory that most universities could only hope to create.;   But Microsoft
founder Bill Gates has done just that, forming a software research facility
that the company hopes will eventually employ 50 or 60 top-flight computer
scientists.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Gates started right at the top, tapping as his director of research Rick
Rashid, 39, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University
regarded as one of the top software researchers in the country.;   Most big
software companies have some kind of "research" going on in the back room
somewhere, although for the most part it is really just the first stages of
developing the company's next commercial product. A few companies even have a
"skunk works" where sometimes quirky, often secret projects are funded with
the hope that they will lead to products in a couple of years.;   But
Microsoft appears to be investing in a third and far rarer sort of operation,
one dedicated to exploring fundamental issues in computer software without
management pressure to undertake projects with clear profit potential.;  
'WE'RE NOT doing products; this isn't a skunk works," insists Rashid. "We want
to do research in computer science that will lead to the development of new
technologies. I don't believe it's in anyone's interest that this be a
philanthropic venture, but we're not going to be producing the next version of
Windows.";   Indeed, while the fruits of Microsoft's research will be used
where possible for financial gain, Rashid says the lab will also publish its
findings in scientific journals, open to others in the research community.;  
Computer science is different from pure sciences like physics, where there is
a well-defined "holy grail" eagerly sought by researchers. There's no computer
science equivalent to the physicist's search for elusive subatomic particles
that will help define the fundamental rules of the universe. Computer
scientists are still fumbling around in an infant discipline, even compared to
the youthful field of quantum physics.;   "We're still in the alchemy stage,
sort of like physics in the 19th century," says Mark Weiser, director of the
computer science lab at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, which Rashid says
serves as one of his models for the Microsoft lab. "There's no unified field
theory of software.";   IN SOME ways, that's a benefit: Computer scientists
are free to roam in a thousand areas of inquiry, all the time able to keep
computer users in mind because there's no elusive theory to prove for its own
sake.;   "This is an opportunity to take a fresh look at what computing can be
like, how computers will be used in the next five to 10 years," Rashid says.; 
 One area of research will be "natural languages," giving humans the ability
to communicate with computers through regular language rather than very
precise commands. Microsoft hired some leading natural language researchers
even before Rashid -- somewhat reluctantly -- was lured away from Carnegie
Mellon and the Mach software project he led for many years. That research into
expanding the capabilities of the Unix operating system can be expected to
serve Rashid well at Microsoft.;   An effort like this is a refreshingly
positive sign in an industry that represents the future of American technology
yet is often a slave to the next release of some word-processing program.  </TEXT>
