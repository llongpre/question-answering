finance revolution - The acquisition of Quicken gives the PC industry leader
dominance in a key area

Microsoft's planned Dollars 1.5bn acquisition of Intuit, publisher of
Quicken, the leading personal finance program, reflects its determination to
dominate the emerging market for on-line electronic commerce.
'The opportunity is incredible,' said Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, who
has been pouring resources into the development of ways to profit from the
coming 'information superhighways'. He says personal electronic transactions
 -for example, paying bills and shopping from home - will continue to grow
with the proliferation of home computers. 'Managing finances is a
pre-eminent application that the electronic world will advance. Microsoft
wants to be there.'
Microsoft has agreed to exchange 1.336 shares of Microsoft stock for each
share of Intuit, with a provision that the ratio will be adjusted to
maintain a floor value of Dollars 71 a share should the value of Microsoft's
shares decline.
The deal - the largest acquisition in the history of the software industry -
also demonstrates the ability of Microsoft to bolster its market leadership
through acquisitions when its own products fail. 'This is a case of 'if you
can't beat 'em buy 'em',' said Mr David Coursey, publisher of PC Letter, a
computer industry newsletter.
With fiscal 1994 sales of Dollars 4.65bn and net income of Dollars 1.15bn,
Microsoft is by far the world's largest and most profitable software
company. Intuit reported sales of Dollars 223m for the fiscal year ending in
July, with net losses of Dollars 173.2m after merger-related charges.
Excluding charges, Intuit earned Dollars 25.4m. (The company changed its
fiscal year following the acquisition in December of ChipSoft, a publisher
of tax preparation software.)
Personal finance is one of the few segments of the PC software market that
Microsoft has failed to dominate. Intuit's Quicken is used by about 6m PC
owners, or 75 per cent of all 'active personal finance users', according to
an Intuit survey. Microsoft's competing 'Money' program has captured only a
tiny share of the market since its introduction two years ago.
'For nearly 10 years, Intuit has been the industry's shining example of how
a small, well-run company with great products could beat Microsoft at its
own game,' said Mr Coursey. The sale of Intuit 'is a good deal for its
shareholders, but a sad day for independent software companies', he says.
The acquisition will roughly double Microsoft's sales of software
specifically designed for home computer users. It also gives it an immediate
entry into the emerging market for home banking.
Through partnerships with Visa International and Checkfree, Intuit has
established direct on-line links with financial institutions and a system to
allow individuals to pay bills electronically.
In addition to its home-banking arrangements, Intuit offers on-line updates
of mutual funds' performance and other financial data to the users of its
software. Intuit also recently acquired the National Payment Clearing House,
an electronic bill-paying service, which had been processing payments for
users of Microsoft Money.
Microsoft had been planning similar ties with banks and financial
information sources in preparation for the launch of its own computer
on-line service, code-named Marvel, next year. Electronic banking is now
likely to become a key part of Marvel. The service has not been formally
announced by Microsoft, but is expected to be part of the company's 'Windows
95' operating system program, due out next year.
'Our mission has been to lead the digital revolution in the financial
services sector,' said Mr Scott Cook, Intuit's chairman and co-founder. The
decision to sell his company to Microsoft was a 'trade-off', he said,
'between being a big fish in your carp pond and independence versus the
opportunity to change the world in terms of the way people manage their
financial lives'. As an independent company, Intuit lacked the resources to
fully exploit opportunities to sell its products internationally and develop
new products, Mr Cook said. It also lacked the clout to negotiate deals with
large banks to expand its home banking services.
When the deal is consummated, Mr Cook will become an executive
vice-president of Microsoft, in charge of a new 'electronic commerce'
product division, based at Intuit's headquarters in Menlo Park, California.
The acquisition agreement has been approved by the directors of both
companies, but may be subject to regulatory review. This could be more than
a formality for Microsoft, which recently signed to an anti-trust consent
decree following a US Justice Department investigation. In a move to avoid
potential anti-trust problems, Microsoft said that it would sell its
personal finance management program to Novell.
Terms of the transaction with Novell were not revealed. Mr Gates said the
sale price 'will not be material'.
Yesterday, Intuit's shares soared on news of the acquisition plans, to close
at Dollars 67 3/8 after reaching Dollars 73 1/4. This is well up on
Wednesday's Dollars 50 1/4 when trading was suspended pending announcement
of the deal. Microsoft's share price was down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 55
15/16.
