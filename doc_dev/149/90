   Processors handling the alligators killed
in Florida's first gator season in two decades say they are working
overtime to keep up with successful hunters.
   ``We've been working until 2 or 3 in the morning every night,''
said Kenneth Geiger, who runs one of 29 facilities in Florida that
skin and butcher alligators. ``They're stacking up like cordwood.''
   Less than halfway through the monthlong hunt, which began Sept.
1 and was authorized because of the proliferation of the
alligators, several hunters are near the quota of 15 each. The hunt
is monitored by the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,
but the 238 licensed hunters are not required to file records until
two weeks after the hunt ends.
   ``We won't know anything about numbers until after the
harvest,'' said Scott Ball, public information specialist with the
commission. ``We kept a tally the first day, and we counted at
least 131 gators.''
   If each hunter bags the quota, 3,450 alligators will be killed.
The commission has estimated about 2,600 alligators would be killed.
   ``We've been going literally 24 hours a day,'' said G.O. Parrot,
a processor near Bushnell. ``We've probably done about 50 or 60
since the season started.''
   ``It takes us about an hour a foot and we've done 200 feet of
gator and boxed 750 pounds of meat,'' said Barry Holdridge, the
chief processor at Hooks Alligator Product in Davie. ``If every
hunter gets their quota, we will be up to our eyes in gator.''
   A licensed processor will sometimes buy the whole alligator for
$30 to $50 a foot. Other hunters pay a processing fee and get back
the meat and hide.
