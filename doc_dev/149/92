<LEADPARA>  The other runners chasing Dina Farage during the fall cross country season
must have felt like Wile E. Coyote trying to stick a fork in the Road Runner.;
   The 19-year-old West Valley College sophomore hit the ground running and
challenged everyone to catch her. Nobody did.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Farage won all 10 of her races in dominating fashion, becoming the only WVC
cross country runner, male or female, to go undefeated in a season in the 20
years since coach Bill Campbell began turning the college's program into one
of the most successful in the state.;    By winning the Golden Gate
Conference, Northern California and California state titles, Farage is the
undisputed queen of cross country in California community college athletics.; 
  "She has a competitive fire. She doesn't want to lose to anyone, and she
runs that way," Campbell said of his star runner. "The gun goes off and she's
just gone.";    Out in front all year;  Farage, at 5-feet-2 and 94 pounds, is
a lean, mean running machine. This past season, over distances of 2.95 to 3.1
miles, she literally never had to run beside anyone.;    "That's exactly how I
like to run; go out and take control of a race," Farage said. "I ran my own
race and didn't care who was behind me.";    She led West Valley women's cross
country team to the conference and Nor-Cal championships, and sixth place in
the state.;    At the Nor-Cal championships in Redding, Farage finished with a
time of 18 minutes and 11 seconds, smashing the old Nor-Cal record of 18:48.
She ran 1:09 faster than the second-place finisher, Rachel Austin of American
River College.;    Not bad for a runner who came out of Gunderson High School
of couple of years ago without a single college scholarship offer.;    Not
great in high school;  "I didn't have a great season my senior year in high
school," Farage said. "It got me down. I didn't think I'd improve and didn't
think I could make it on a running team in college.";    But, to the sorrow of
other runners, she decided to try.;    Using her recipe for success --
determination, hard work and self-confidence -- Farage started her college
career with an outstanding freshman year. She won the conference championship,
finished second in Northern California and ninth in the state.;    As good as
that was, it was just a preview.;    The 1990 cross country season started
last September with the Sierra Invitational. As she would do all season,
Farage immediately went to the lead and stayed there. She won the race by more
than a minute.;    At an invitational race in San Francisco's Golden Gate
Park, featuring community colleges from around the state and three runners who
had beaten her in the state finals the year before, Farage won handily.;   
Has had to overcome injuries;  In winning, Farage has had to overcome
injuries, including one that caused her to miss much of last spring's track
season. Part of her injury problems stemmed from her training regimen. She
trains the way she runs -- aggressively.;    Campbell has worked with Farage
is helping her become more patient in her training, and to pace herself.;   
Farage's success has only fueled her competitive fires.;    "I love running
even more. It feels good when you're going fast and setting a good pace," she
said. "There's satisfaction in knowing I've accomplished what I set out to
do.";    Now, more than a dozen four-year colleges and universities are
recruiting her. They include some of the top competitive cross country schools
in the nation, such as the University of Washington, University of Oregon, and
the University of California, Irvine.;    Campbell said Farage's career at
West Valley "shows what community college athletics is all about.";    A
community college program gives a high school athlete two more years of
competition. And that can provide the athlete who was a late bloomer or
injured in high school the opportunity to impress other colleges, he explained.  </TEXT>
