<LEADPARA>  An unusual coalition of 21 computer companies used the introduction of a new
computer standard Tuesday to challenge Intel Corp., saying in effect that the
giant Santa Clara chip company had to keep its microprocessors on technology's
cutting edge or lose the enormous market share it built up during the 1980s.; 
  That was perhaps the most surprising development Tuesday, as CEOs from many
of the companies announced in New York their long-anticipated -- and numbingly
confusing -- alliance to develop a new kind of work-station computer, one that
takes advantages of some of high technology's hottest design trends.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SETTING UP A CHALLENGE TO INTEL
21 FIRMS UNITE TO CREATE NEW COMPUTER STANDARD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Led by Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston and Microsoft Corp. of Redmond,
Wash., the Ace Computing Environment will feature a Unix operating system and
a lean, new style of microprocessor design known as RISC -- reduced
instruction-set computing -- that is manufactured by Mips Computer Systems of
San Jose. Supporters of those RISC chips say they are inherently cheaper and
more powerful than the microprocessors made by firms such as Intel.;   
However, the ACE companies said they also want to continue the Intel-based
computer lines they are selling today -- as long as Intel keeps its chips
competitive. Several executives said privately that the alliance was designed
to send that message to Intel.;    That emphasis, which emerged in interviews
with executives of participating firms, was unexpected, since the alliance
originally was seen as a way for Compaq and similar computer companies, which
built their businesses on Intel technologies, to use the Mips chip to develop
their current machines into the new, rapidly growing work-station market,
dominated by Sun Microsystems Inc. and other firms.;    Much of Tuesday's
emphasis, however, was on the role older technologies would play in new
development plans. In fact, Fred Cutler, Compaq's director of software
marketing, said in an interview that Intel could eliminate the need for a new
product line by making its microprocessors as speedy and inexpensive as others
on the market.;    Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said his software firm would
be writing a new operating system, called OS/2 3.0, that would run on machines
powered either by Intel or by Mips microprocessors. Since the new operating
system would be compatible with programs written for Microsoft's venerable DOS
operating system, it would expand the life of the DOS world, which encompasses
tens of millions of machines.;    Jim Clark, chairman of Silicon Graphics of
Mountain View, a key member of the alliance, said Tuesday's announcement
didn't quite reflect the ACE group's original intentions.;    "What we
envisioned at first was simply getting a group of people together to sign up
for the Mips architecture," Clark said. "To some degree the additional spin
came about as a result of Compaq and Microsoft wanting to maintain their
current machines. The alliance is a way for Compaq and Microsoft to endorse a
new platform without upsetting their current customer base. Intel is not being
abandoned. Companies are telling customers they can make a choice.";    While
such personal computer industry stalwarts as Compaq may be interested in
keeping safe their Intel lines of business, other firms clearly will be intent
on using ACE to design new kinds of computers.;    Other members of the
alliance include Digital Equipment Corp., NEC Corp., Pyramid Technology Corp.,
Tandem Computers Inc., the Santa Cruz Operation, as well as European and
Japanese firms. The group hopes its collective heft will be enough to convince
customers that the approach to computing should be considered, even though
products won't be ready for at least a year.;    There are some precedents for
ACE -- most notably the successful effort of Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and
others three years ago to establish the EISA interconnection system for
personal computers. But Tuesday's alliance involves a far more
all-encompassing and ambitious goal -- the creation of a hardware and software
system that can be used in everything from lap-tops to mainframes.;    The 21
firms have settled some of the basic questions about the system's design, but
many remain unresolved, and the group hasn't yet decided even how to govern
itself.;    And competitors quickly questioned whether the group could be
successful.;    "This is what the Germans would call 'Die Eier-legende
Wollmilchsau': an egg-laying woolly milk pig," said Franz Nawratil, a vice
president in H-P's computer systems division. "It's what happens when you try
to put together many different animals. You don't know what you'll end up
with.";    Nawratil said H-P, as a single company, has had trouble moving from
one computer system to another, and said he doubted how quickly such a large
group could maneuver.;    And representatives of other work-station companies
noted that Sun, H-P and IBM already have significant, perhaps unstoppable,
momentum.;    ACE insiders conceded the group faced a number of other
obstacles, including whether Microsoft can actually design the
high-performance successor to DOS that it is promising. Despite its dominance
of the personal computer marketplace, the firm is not well-regarded for its
technological prowess.;    Another question was whether the alliance would
resolve the Babel-like confusion of competing Unix versions now sold by
alliance members. The plan is for all of those systems to be replaced by one
sold by the Santa Cruz Operation, a task of considerable marketing and
technological complexity whose logistics have yet to be worked out.  </TEXT>
