   The first day of Florida's first legal
alligator hunt in 26 years netted about 130 gators across the
state, state game officials report.
   Thirty-eight of the huge reptiles were bagged in the Everglades
and 36 were taken near Lake Okeechobee, the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission, which is supervising the hunt, said Friday.
   While some lucky hunters bagged animals as long as 9 feet, most
of the 230 people granted hunting permits were disappointed after
the first day of the monthlong gator season.
   The hunters selected at random from among about 5,000 permit
applicants set out at sunset Thursday with harpoons, nooses,
crossbows _ almost anything but a gun, which was forbidden.
   David and Jerry Navin, two novice hunters, snaked through a Dade
County canal in the darkness looking for the red-reflecting eyes
that give the reptiles away at night. But the gators refused to
play along.
   ``There's a few here, but they're not really doing what they're
supposed to,'' chuckled David Navin. ``They're a little tougher
than we thought.''
   Farther north on Lake Okeechobee, another of the designated
hunting areas, some gator pursuers fared better.
   Thomas Alpern, 25, of New York City, the only northerner to get
a permit, bagged a nine-footer despite worries he might not manage
to kill the animal even if he captured it.
   The meat and hide of a single alligator can fetch $300 to $500.
   The alligator population in Florida has about doubled to an
estimated 1 million since federal anti-poaching methods were
adopted in 1970. Nearly 1,000 gators have been captured in
experimental hunts since 1981.
