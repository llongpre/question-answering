MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, yesterday
reported a 26 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net income, helped by its
Microsoft Windows operating system.
It reported net income of Dollars 265m, or 87 cents a share, compared to
Dollars 210m, or 71 cents, in the fourth quarter of last year.
Revenues totalled Dollars 1.04bn - its first billion dollar quarter -
compared to Dollars 815m a year ago.
The results were in line with market expectations but came after the close
of the Nasdaq market on which Microsoft is quoted.
For the full year, Microsoft made net income of Dollars 953m, up 35 per cent
from the Dollars 708m of 1992, while earnings per share totalled Dollars
3.15, against Dollars 2.41. Revenues totalled Dollars 3.75bn, up 36 per cent
from 1992's Dollars 2.76bn.
Mr Mike Brown, vice-president of finance, noted that net income equalled
25.4 per cent of revenues in fiscal 1993.
Mr Bill Gates, chairman, said: 'Throughout the year the adoption of the
Microsoft Windows operating system worldwide has been a major part of our
success. Microsoft has distributed more than 30m copies of Windows and
continues to distribute more than 1m copies a month.'
He said the company was making long-term investments in technologies
including software for office machines and personal home devices.
