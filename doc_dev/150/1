  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/4/1994 -- A government 
delegation from the Netherlands headed by Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers arrived in Bucharest on Tuesday, April 19, for a two-day 
official visit. The Dutch guests were greeted at the Otopeni 
Airport by Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu, Minister of State Dan Mircea Popescu, 
the Dutch ambassador in Bucharest, Monique Frank, and other 
officials. 
  Shortly after his arrival, Premier Ruud Lubbers said that 
his 
visit in Romania would further substantiate the cooperation 
between the two countries. The Netherlands is located on the 
other side of Europe and considers that transports and trade are 
especially important, said the Dutch prime minister and added 
that the Rhine- Main-Danube watercourse would ease the bilateral 
ties, as Romania is located on the other end of the road and 
therefore the bilateral cooperation was extremely necessary, not 
only in the economic field but also in the political one and 
perhaps also in tourism. The Dutch premier mentioned the 
Latin-rooted language spoken by Romanians as a very special 
trait of Romania in central Europe. 
  On Wednesday [20 April], Premier Ruud Lubbers is scheduled 
to 
meet Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman, Chamber of 
Deputies' Speaker Adrian Nastase, the presidential adviser Misu 
Negritoiu, and the governor of the National Bank of Romania, 
Mugur Isarescu. 
  Today Ruud Lubbers was received by Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu, at Cotroceni Palace. The Dutch guest was accompanied 
by Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Kooijmans. The visit of 
the high Dutch officials is the first of its kind since 
Romania's December 1989 revolution. 
  The interview was attended by Romanian Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Teodor Melescanu, Minister of State Dan Mircea Popescu, 
presidential advisers Misu Negritoiu and Traian Chebeleu, the 
Romanian ambassador to the Netherlands, Marin Buhoara. 
  After the official talks, the Romanian president gave his 
guests lunch.
