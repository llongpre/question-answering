  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu received at Cotroceni Palace on 31 May Miltiades 
Evert, president of the New Democracy Party of the Hellenic 
Republic, leader of the opposition in Greece. 
  After recalling the fine relations between Romania and 
Greece, even at the time when the two countries belonged to 
differing social systems, the Hellenic politician pleaded in a 
press statement for the necessity of establishing a climate of 
peace in the Balkans. "Romania, Bulgaria and Greece are spaces 
of stability and these countries have to take over the 
initiative of pacifying the Balkans," Miltiades Evert said. 
  He mentioned he proposed to the Romanian president "the 
signing of an agreement on existing frontiers intangibility" by 
the Balkan countries, as well as the passage to concrete 
measures for such a document to be signed the soonest. "The 
signing of such an agreement would be the first great step 
toward peace in the Balkans, that should be ensured first of all 
by the Balkan peoples," he added. 
  In the same context, Miltiades Evert said that the signing 
of 
the proposed agreement would be difficult at this moment for 
Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, countries that are at war now, but 
the other states in the zone, he said, were bound to do it 
"precisely in order to prevent the expansion of the conflict and 
to ensure welfare and economic development in the Balkans." 
  The conclusion of treaties to guarantee the current 
frontiers 
can be a first step toward securing peace in the Balkans, 
assessed Miltiadis Evert, president of the New Democracy Party 
of Greece, during an interview with Romanian Minister of Labour 
and Social Protection Dan Mircea Popescu, in Bucharest, on 31 
May. 
  The interview occasioned a survey of the stage of the 
bilateral relations which, they assessed, had to be increased 
and diversified, as well as the approach of stability and 
cooperation in the Balkans. 
  Minister Dan Mircea Popescu outlined to the guest the 
Romanian Government's current priorities, emphasizing among them 
the securing of an adequate social protection and an increasing 
living standard of the population. He considered the 
difficulties Romania was going through at this time could be 
eased only through good-quality work, an efficient management 
and steady international economic cooperation, which, between 
Romania and Greece, could be achieved on multiple planes.
