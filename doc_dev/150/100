  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 13/6/1994 -- The National 
Peasant Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] started to collect 
signatures necessary to trigger the procedure of suspension 
against Romanian President Ion Iliescu, said Chamber of Deputies 
member Razvan Dobrescu at a press conference on Monday, 13 June. 
  Reiterating the PNTCD's belief that President Iliescu has 
breached the "independence of the judges" through his statements 
made during a visit in Satu Mare, northern Romania, referring to 
the issue of the nationalized houses, the PNTCD deputy drew 
attention upon the serious consequences of any interference with 
judges' rulings. The PNTCD deputy emphasized the fact that his 
party considered as a "real danger" the maintaining in office of 
a president who "does not watch for the good functioning of the 
state authorities."
