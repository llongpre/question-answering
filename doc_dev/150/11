  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 17/1/1994 -- "It was an attempt 
against the constitutional democracy in Romania," said Romanian 
Constitutional Court Judge Antonie Iorgovan, cited by the daily 
ADEVARUL, referring to the news broadcasted by the National 
Television on Saturday, January 14, informing that the Hungarian 
Democratic Union of Romania [UDMR], the ethnic party of the 
Hungarian minority, had met with mayors of several localities to 
discuss the issue of "self-governing." 
  Judge Antonie Iorgovan, who is also professor of 
constitutional law of the Bucharest University, reminds that 
Romania's constitution does not provide such a concept because 
of the simple reason that there is only one government in a 
unitary state, politically responsible in front of the single 
parliament as the representative body of the Romanian nation." 
  Antonie Iorgovan reminded also that the "self-governing" 
wording was not stipulated by any unitary state's constitution 
in Western Europe as they consecrated a regional system of local 
administration and not a departmental system." Antonie Iorgovan 
draws attention also to the fact that even though only a 
departmental system of administrative-territorial organization 
in counties exists in Romania and not one recognizing regions, 
lands, provinces or communities, "there are political forces who 
employ such wording." Judge Iorgovan cites the Article 31, 
Paragraph 7, of the constitution as saying: "Any defamation of 
the country and the nation, instigation to a war of aggression, 
to national, racial, class or religious hatred, any incitement 
to discrimination, territorial separatism, public violence as 
well as an obscene conduct contrary to morality are prohibited 
by law." 
  The public opinion in Romania has repeatedly showed in the 
recent years, its concern with regard to the statements made by 
several UDMR leaders questioning directly or in a dissimulated 
way the issue of Transylvania, ancient Romanian territory, 
temporarily under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg 
empire, till 1918. 
  According to the January 1992 census, the population of the 
counties of the historic province of Transylvania is made up by 
Romanians with 72.3 percent.
