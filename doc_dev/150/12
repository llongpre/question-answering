  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- Romania's President 
Ion Iliescu presided on April 11 a meeting of the country's 
Supreme Defence Council. Two drafts were examined and initialed 
on the occasion, namely "The Integrated Outlook of Romanian 
National Security" and "Romania's Military Defence Doctrine." 
  The former includes the fundamental tenets, objectives and 
trends defining the general policy of security of Romania. The 
latter has been drafted with observance of the provisions of 
Romania's Constitution and laws, the basic principles, 
objectives and guiding lines of the security policy of the 
Romanian state, the current stage and the tendencies of the 
political-military affairs at a world, continental and regional 
scale, risks and threats that appear as likely against Romania's 
national interests, the short- and middle-term evolution of the 
country's military integration with the European and 
Euro-Atlantic security structures. 
  The country's Supreme Defense Council decided that the two 
documents be referred to parliament for endorsement. 
  The agenda included debates and approval of a draft 
"Presentation Document: Romania," written by the Romanian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Romania's Ministry of National 
Defence, in consequence of Romania's joining the "Partnership 
for Peace" plan. The document includes the measures proposed by 
Romania, necessary for fulfilment of the political objectives of 
the Partnership and the aspects of military character or of 
other type that Romania can made available for NATO, which is 
going to be forwarded the draft. 
  Romania reasserts in the document its determination to be 
faithful to all the principles and targets of the "Partnership 
for Peace" to the assertions in the "Declaration of the Heads of 
States and Governments Who Attended the Sitting of the 
North-Atlantic Council Held in Brussels on January 10-11, 1994." 
  Political and organisation measures have been enlisted in 
the 
document intended to secure a democratic control on the Army and 
facilitate transparency in planning national defence and 
drafting the budget, fields of cooperation, human and logistic 
resources that Romania can contribute to the Partnership for 
Peace plan.
