  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Mircea Geoana made a few points on news items in the 
Romanian media on the Romanian-Hungarian treaty, during a news 
conference he held in Bucharest on 20 April. The news items 
claimed that "sources at the Foreign Ministry and the presidency 
said that, pursuant to U.S. and NATO pressures, the basic 
Romanian-Hungarian political treaty will be signed by 1 July, 
1994." 
  Mircea Geoana denied the existence of such an understanding 
and said that as far as Romania was concerned, it was interested 
to conclude the political treaty with Hungary the soonest. 
"Even before the Paris conference or 26-27 May, when the 
`stability' pact initiated by Balladur is launched, we would 
like to do it," said Mircea Geoana. He added that Hungary has 
not stated its stand on the proposals advanced long ago by the 
Romanian Foreign Ministry regarding the outstanding issues. "If 
we got an answer and were able to agree on a new round of 
negotiations, this would be a positive element in the actuation 
of the Romanian-Hungarian political dialogue," he said. 
  Regarding the issue of lifting the embargo against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, "from what we know this is not 
envisaged for now" -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mircea Geoana 
said, referring to the "official launch" of the joint demarche 
of Greece, Bulgaria and Romania in this respect. The Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said such a demarche ought to be made at the 
right time, when the process of political negotiations reaches a 
congenial stage. "In keeping with the evolution of the 
negotiations between the Bosnian conflicting parties, a decision 
will be analyzed and made by all parties concerned", he said, 
adding that Hungary showed interest in the demarche, while 
Ukraine did not state its stand. 
  The idea of a joint demarche of Greece, Bulgaria and Romania 
for the lifting of the embargo on the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia was launched during the Bucharest visit by the Greek 
foreign minister a few weeks ago. The initiative pursues the 
easing of the negative effects emerged following the application 
of the UN sanctions by the countries neighbouring ex-Yugoslavia. 
  The prime minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Jacques 
Smiter, will make an official visit in Romania over April 24-26 
at the invitation of the Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu, the Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesman also said. 
  The agenda of the visit includes official talks with the 
Romanian premier, interviews with Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu, Senate President Oliviu Gherman, Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker Adrian Nastase. 
  On the occasion of the visit, an inter-governmental 
agreement 
of cooperation in the fields of culture, education, science and 
sport will be signed. 
  The postponement of the signing of the basic political 
treaty 
between Romania and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, first 
scheduled to take place while Yugoslav Federal President Zoran 
Lilic was in Romania for the Crans Montana Forum, stirred the 
interest of the journalists who attended the Foreign Ministry 
briefing on 20 April. Confirming President Lilic would not 
attend the Forum because of the tense situation in Bosnia, 
Mircea Geoana said the official document would be signed only 
after the two parties agreed on all issues. "It is an important 
political document with a neighbour state, that has to fall in 
line with the whole of the political treaties Romania is 
concluding with other states of the world," he added. "It is 
not to be achieved upon conjunctural bases, statuting instead 
the format of bilateral relations in all spheres." 
  Referring to the conflict in Gorazde, the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman reiterated Romania's constant stand relying 
upon the principle of using the whole range of 
political-diplomatic means to induce the conflicting parties to 
go on negotiating. "We follow with worry the events in Gorazde 
and see the high rate of contacts and statements by all parties 
concerned, which leaves room for optimism," Geoana said.
