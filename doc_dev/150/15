  [Excerpt] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/1/1994 -- The spokesman 
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania, Mircea Geoana, 
read to the press at the 19 January news briefing a statement by 
which the Romanian Foreign Ministry takes note with interest and 
satisfaction of the signing in Moscow by the presidents of the 
United States, the Russian Federation and the Ukraine of the 
documents by which the Ukraine renounces the nuclear strategic 
missiles deployed in its territory. 
  The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reasserts Romania's 
firm attachment to the aims and principles of non-proliferation 
of nuclear arms and welcomes this important decision made by the 
Ukraine, a decision apt to contribute to strengthening security, 
stability and confidence in our geographical zone, in Europe and 
the whole world. Romania, while duly appreciating the signing 
of the Moscow documents as an important example of nuclear 
disarmament, expresses its hope that other countries holding 
nuclear armament in their possession will take new steps towards 
liquidating their arsenals, the statement concludes. 
  Other subjects mentioned at the news briefing: Scheduled for 
27-28 January 1994 in Rabat, the proceedings of the eighth 
session of the Joint Romanian-Moroccan Intergovernmental 
Commitee for Economic and Technical Cooperation will be chaired 
by the two countries' foreign ministers. This will occasion 
Teodor Melescanu an official visit to Morocco at the invitation 
of state minister in charge with the external affairs and 
cooperation Abdellatif Filali. 
  The two sides will tackle and establish concrete measures 
and 
actions apt to lead to the relaunch of the bilateral political 
dialogue, to boost commercial relations and favour the 
furtherance of economic cooperation in fields of joint interest, 
such as port facilities, road building, drilling, technical 
assistance, professional training. The sides also propose to 
negotiate and sign an agreement to guarantee and promote 
investment, as well as a cooperation protocol between the two 
foreign ministries and the programme reflecting the 1994-1996 
cultural agreement. 
  Friday, 21 January, Foreign Minister Melescanu will have an 
interview with Joseph Kruzel, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of 
defence for European and NATO policies, who is heading the U.S. 
delegation to the meeting of the U.S.-Romania bilateral working 
group on matters regarding political-military cooperation 
relations. 
  Spokesman for the Foreign Ministry Mircea Geoana also told 
the 19 January briefing that the message of Mrs. Madeleine 
Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, special envoy 
of American President Bill Clinton, who paid a visit in Romania 
Saturday, January 15, was considered, alongside recent 
statements by President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, 
to substantially back Romania's efforts to reinforce its 
stability and security in a troubled regional framework and in a 
larger context, in order to consolidate the Romanian democratic 
society. [passage omitted]
