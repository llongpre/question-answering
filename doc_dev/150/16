  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/4/1994 -- Geza Entz, member of 
the Hungarian Government, paid his Romanian visit in spite of 
the fact that the Romanian Foreign Ministry was emphatic about 
abstaining from this until Romanian authorities agreed. "It is 
regrettable that the Hungarian dignitary chose to ignore the 
Romanian authorities", said Ambassador Traian Chebeleu during a 
news conference on 8 April, in answering a ROMPRES question. 
  Referring to the same aspect, the presidential spokesman 
showed that the Romanian authorities were worried by that 
gesture "that accounts for a very serious brake in the efforts 
to normalize the Romanian-Hungarian relations and conclude the 
basic treaty between the two countries," as the Budapest 
official's behaviour defied the principles of inter-state 
relations. 
  Referring to the pardoning of the ethnic Hungarians involved 
in the crimes at Zetea and Dealu, Harghita County, presidential 
spokesman Traian Chebeleu said it was not complete. It was made 
in such a way as to have the convicts eligible for parole while 
the final decision would be made in keeping with the existing 
procedures by the local court. 
  As regarded the treaty envisaged to be concluded with the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Ambassador Chebeleu said it was 
part of Romania's policy of equal treatment of all states in the 
territory of former Yugoslavia. 
  The statement of Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, 
who 
did not name Romania among the countries that gave the Republic 
of Moldova support, accusing it instead of failure to fulfil its 
obligations, was termed as "ununderstandable" by Traian Chebeleu 
who said the Romanian authorities waited for "the necessary 
explanation" that would be requested through the Romanian 
Embassy in Chisinau. 
  The spokesman also said President Ion Iliescu was 
represented 
at the funeral of playwright Eugen Ionesco by Romania's 
Ambassador in Paris, Anton Vatasescu. 
  Requested to deny or confirm an alleged meeting between 
President Slobodan Milosevic and American General George Joulwan 
during the Serb head of state's stay in Bucharest, Ambassador 
Traian Chebeleu definitely denied it: "The meeting did not and 
could not occur because of President Milosevic's very busy 
schedule, he said. [no closing quotation mark as received] 
  Romanian President Ion Iliescu will pay a state visit to 
France over 14-11 April, 1994, presidential spokesman Traian 
Chebeleu also announced in his news conference. 
  The schedule of the visit includes, apart from talks with 
President Mitterrand, an interview with Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, meetings with Senate President Rene Monory and 
President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin, with other 
politicians. 
  He is also expected to meet at the National Council of the 
French Employers with representatives of business circles and to 
visit the GEC-Alsthom works. 
  The presidential spokesman assessed the visit was "a natural 
moment in the evolution of the Romanian-French relations after 
the revolution and at the same time it is meant to boost them." 
Stressing that in the four years after the revolution France has 
given Romania decisive support in its efforts for rapprochement 
and integration in the bodies of the European democratic states, 
Ambassador Traian Chebeleu highlighted that Romania's president 
attached great importance to the forthcoming political 
consultations with France, that would cover a wide area of 
issues, from ways to further develop the bilateral relations and 
the speeding up of Romania's integration in the European 
institutions to the current questions of security in our zone 
and in Europe generally. 
  The visit will have also an important economic dimension, 
the 
result of which we hope to be an ever more significant presence 
of the French companies in the Romanian economy, the 
presidential spokesman said.
