  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/2/1994 -- Dumitru Paslaru, 
spokesman of the ruling party of Social Democracy of Romania 
(PDSR), said developments in the Republic of Moldova, the 
reconsideration of the stands of important political 
personalities there and their statements rendered delicate the 
continuation of the political relations and the rapprochement 
between Romania and that state. In an interview with ROMPRES, 
Paslaru added that the PDSR considered the statements made by 
Snegur [president of the Republic of Moldova] and Motpan 
[president of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova] to be 
inciting, offending the Romanians everywhere, an attempt at the 
country's national integrity, an obvious disconsideration of 
public opinion of the Romanian majority in the present Republic 
of Moldova. "We however hope these statements are just a 
temporary element in the political climate of the Republic of 
Moldova. These statements should better not turn into ruling 
theses and the optimistic tone of our relations of so far should 
be resumed," the PDSR spokesman also said. 
  The Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] Vice-President 
Cornel Brahas assesses as a mistake the fact that the Romanian 
authorities recognized officially "this shadow state in 
Romania's historical territory. It is an open attempt at our 
integrity and a tragical betrayal of the Romanian nation. No 
matter what eastern or western chancellories encouraged Snegur 
to assume this terrible burden, we must not give in to 
defeatism," Cornel Brahas said. 
  "I have not been taken by surprise by this statement made by 
Mr. Mircea Snegur, a good Romanian speaker but not an equally 
good Romanian. It was prepared by other political actions which 
we ignored when we did not encourage," said Professor Ion Coja, 
an outstanding member of the Agrarian Democratic Party of 
Romania (PDAR). "What's even worse is that, in a concerted 
manner, some sort of declaration of annexation of Romania's 
territory to the former USSR is also launched. It is high time 
that the president of Romania, the parliament and government 
took at long last a stand that should not be criticized by the 
future generations of Romanians on either bank of the Prut," 
Professor Ion Coja said. 
  "The National Council of Reintegration and the National 
Party 
of Reintegration have decided to `back' Mircea Snegur, 
organizing the participation in the referendum of the more than 
one million refugees or their descendants, either Romanians, 
Jews, Germans, Poles," said Mircea Druc, former prime minister 
of the Republic of Moldova, now president of the National Party 
of Reintegration. "A referendum of all those who were forced to 
leave their native land following the Soviet invasion. In a 
near future, we will convene also a world congress of all 
refugees because we too, want to be a part of `Snegur's people' 
summoned to the referendum," Mircea Druc said. 
  "Mircea Snegur has proved he has remained a cent [as 
received] percent communist and no longer thinks, even for a 
moment, that he is Romanian," said Ion Diaconescu, 
vice-president of the Christian Democratic National Peasant 
Party. 
  "For him, the notion of Romanian is completely subordinated 
to the political creed for which he has campaigned for a 
lifetime. His theses are communist, they were Stalin's as well 
and he keeps them because he grew up with them. 
  "Nobody imposes Romania's union with Bessarabia by force, 
but 
to go as far as declaring that Romanians and Moldovans are 
different peoples is a nonsense launched by communists which 
Mircea Snegur, as a truthful disciple, has adopted."
