  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- "UDMR [Democratic 
Union of Hungarians in Romania] sees itself compelled to 
reassess the role and aim of its representation to parliament, 
because UDMR does not accept to act just as a stand-in in the 
country's legislative body," runs a statement made by this 
party's parliamentary group leader Gyula Vida at the end of the 
debates on the education act. 
  In the group's opinion, the "education act in its present 
form is absolutely unacceptable for the Hungarian community. It 
(the law) enacts an obvious and unspeakable discrimination 
against the ethnic minorities in Romania, and at the same time, 
a flagrant violation of the constitution." 
  The main objections UDMR has against the draft law is the 
restriction of the constitutional right to learn in the native 
tongue in all the objects of study, the abolition of the 
existing structures of specialized education in minority 
languages, the interdiction to train in higher education 
institutions specialists in social and economic sciences, the 
inacceptance to have the confessional schools reorganized and 
re-established. 
  "The ruling (Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR) is 
visibly the prisoner of extremist political forces. The 
government's lack of political will to solve these problems 
hampers the building of a climate of social peace, destabilizing 
the Romanian society," says the UDMR lower house group statement.
