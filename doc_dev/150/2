  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 6/5/1994 -- Carl-Dieter Spranger, 
German minister of economic cooperation, who has been in Romania 
for a few days now and had multiple contacts, was received by 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu on 6 May evening. 
  At the close of the interview President Iliescu termed the 
Romanian-German relations as increasingly good, saying Germany 
was the country that understood the best Romania's difficulties 
caused by the processes of transformation that resembled those 
of the former GDR. "We have found with Germany a more exact 
perception of our problems in the process of transition," the 
Romanian head of state said. 
  As far as the economic relations between the two countries 
were concerned, the president pointed to the existence of mutual 
interests, explaining that both Romania and Germany were located 
"on the Rhine-Main-Danube trans-European axis, with two 
terminals, Rotterdam and Constanta, and with the German economy 
at the center, which will be the engine of the general process 
of the European integration." 
  The German guest noted the good level of the bilateral 
relations. "I believe the reforms these last few years in 
Romania, and especially the situation after 1993 can stir the 
interest of foreign investors," he said. 
  The German minister of economic cooperation, Carl-Dieter 
Spranger met on Friday, 6 May, in Bucharest with the Romanian 
minister of state, head of the Council for Economic 
Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, Mircea Cosea. 
  Within his presentation of the Romanian economy, Mircea 
Cosea 
said that Romania was giving a very special attention to its 
relations with Germany, because there existed a tradition of 
German industry presence in Romania in the sectors of railroads, 
iron and steel industry, and telecommunications. The Romanian 
minister expressed hope that Romania would benefit from German 
aid of capital and technology in the process of reform. Cosea 
said that the German business mentality could be a very 
important factor in the process of reform. 
  The German minister Carl-Dieter Spranger said his visit was 
a 
signal for the extending of the relations with Romania. The 
signing of the agreement on the non-reimbursable economic 
assistance granted to Romania is a relevant sign, said the 
German minister. 
  Minister Spranger said that Germany would send in Romania 
experts in privatization, banking system updating, stock 
exchanges, industrial restructuring, and social protection. 
  Romania is interested in developing a proper collaboration 
framework with Germany, that should allow for the presence of 
German businessmen here, the setting up of joint ventures, as 
well as the intensification of the actions of cooperation and 
commercial exchanges, said Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu on 6 May, during his interview with Carl-Dieter 
Spranger, federal minister of economic cooperation of Germany. 
The Romanian premier assessed that the signing of the technical 
assistance agreement between the two countries was part of the 
preoccupations to improve the management of the commercial 
companies and update and retool the industrial units, especially 
those built with German technology. 
  Minister Spranger said Germany would further back Romania's 
efforts in the European Union, the OECD [Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development], and the World Bank. 
Referring to the German minority in Romania, Spranger said the 
Romanian state's policy with respect to that community was 
favorably regarded in his country.
