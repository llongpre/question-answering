  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 22/3/1994 -- The Senate resumed 
Tuesday, March 22, the debates of the bill on war veterans and 
widows. The parliamentary group of the Hungarian Democratic 
Union of Romania, UDMR, asked for permission to make a political 
declaration on part of the articles of the said bill. Submitted 
to vote, the request was rejected. Consequently the members of 
the UDMR parliamentary group walked out of the Senate Hall. 
  The Senate passed in its Monday, March 21 sitting an 
amendment to an article of the bill on war veterans and widows 
saying that the residents of Romanian territories occupied over 
1940-1945, that were called to arms fight in the Armies of other 
states are considered to be war veterans only "if they did not 
fight against the Romanian Army." The members of the UDMR group 
opposed the amendment.
