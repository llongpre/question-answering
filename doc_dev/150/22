  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/1/1994 -- At the press 
conference of 7 January given by Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, 
spokesman for the Presidency of Romania, the following points 
were made about the steps taken by the head of the Romanian 
state for Romania's adherence to NATO: 
  "It is not incidental that the president [Ion Iliescu] paid 
an official visit to NATO in February 1993. Availing himself of 
this opportunity, President Ion Iliescu said before the NATO 
Council: `As a true partner, Romania wishes to work ever closer 
with NATO and to strengthen its ties with the structures of the 
alliance, to draw closer to them, by taking part in any form of 
cooperation open to the Central European countries. Besides the 
immediate positive effects, all this would be of a nature to 
contribute to creating the prerequisites for reaching the 
strategic aim which is Romania's joining the North Atlantic 
Alliance. This would offer the necessary guarantees for a 
normal evolution of the irreversible process of Romania's 
democratization.' 
  "Subsequent to these official efforts made by the president, 
which were among the first statements of this kind on the topic 
of permitting the countries in this part of Europe access to 
NATO, messages were addressed on two different occasions -- in 
September and December 1993 -- to NATO heads of state and NATO 
Secretary General Woerner, including President Iliescu's 
considerations on the role of NATO in maintaining security in 
Central and East Europe, and the official position relative to 
the inclusion in the alliance of the countries in this part of 
Europe. 
  "Those messages were well received by the member states of 
the alliance and found by the greatest part of their 
representatives as most welcome, straightforward, and clearly 
worded," the presidential spokesman said. 
  On receiving the letter from the president of Romania, the 
representatives of several (NATO) states made a point of showing 
that they would support Romania in its strive for integration in 
NATO and other Euro-Atlantic structures, knowing that Romania 
was resolutely committed to the course of democratization and 
the rule of law, and therefore it should stay in the family of 
the democratic European states. 
  It was also shown that Romania's security interests would be 
considered, as well as its readiness to assume responsibilities 
in ensuring security in Europe. 
  A positive assessment was made of the way Romania responded 
to the initiative of Partnership for Peace, which several member 
countries see as a transitional stage in the gradual extension 
process of the alliance. 
  The message of the Romanian president was unanimously 
appreciated as a significant signal for the priority Romania 
gives to enlarging its political, economic, and security 
relations with the Western countries, the spokesman for the 
presidency said.
