  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 12/01/1994 -- Romania's 
President Ion Iliescu received a letter of reply from Turkey's 
President Suleyman Demirel saying that Turkey favours Romania's 
application to joint NATO and will back the alliance's decisions 
meeting these aspirations. 
  The letter stresses Turkey's admiration of the progress 
marked by Romania since 1990 and the satisfaction at the fine 
and close collaboration within the North-Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, as well as the interest confirmed by Romania in the 
collaboration with that forum that has brought NATO and Romania 
closer. 
  "We see the Partnership for Peace initiative as an 
operational formula in this period of transition and believe it 
will help enhancing the security, stability and fertile 
cooperation in Europe and around it," the January 5, 1994 letter 
by Turkey's president reads.
