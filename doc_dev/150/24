  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 7/3/1994 -- The president of 
the Romanian Senate, Oliviu Gherman, received Monday, 7 March, a 
delegation of the Alliance of the Free Democrats of Hungary 
[SZDSZ], led by Gabor Kuncze, leader of a parliamentary faction 
and its candidate for premiership. 
  The sides talked about the necessity to strengthen the 
bilateral parliamentary ties as a basic element for the 
improvement of the Romanian-Hungarian relations. 
  Oliviu Gherman termed the inexistence of interparliamentary 
relations of the ruling party and the opposition forces in 
Romania with their counterparts in Hungary as "illogical and 
contrary to bilateral interests" and said that as long as UDMR 
(Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania -- an ethnic party 
with representation to Romania's Parliament -- e.n.) is the sole 
parliamentary representative of Romania to the Hungarian 
Parliament, the progress in the bilateral parliamentary 
relations will be "insignificant". Gabor Kuncze remarked that, 
given the short time lying before the present Hungarian 
legislative, the bilateral parliamentary relations between the 
two countries could be intensified after the new legislative 
assumes duties. 
  Both sides agreed that all possibilities should be used to 
improve Romanian-Hungarian relations, and that keeping up false 
tensions is to the interest of neither party. The president of 
the Romanian Senate gave assurances to the Hungarian guests 
that, before its term is over, the Romanian legislative body 
will ratify the Romanian-Hungarian agreement for the mutual 
protection of investments.
