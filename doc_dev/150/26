  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/5/1994 -- The parliamentary 
secretary of state of the German Ministry of the Interior, Horst 
Waffenschmidt, in charge with the affairs of the Germans abroad, 
started on Wednesday a three-day visit in Romania accompanied by 
a delegation comprising deputies in the Bundestag, the 
presidents of the associations of the Swabians and the Saxons of 
Germany, representatives of charity institutions, government 
dignitaries, said Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Simona 
Miculescu at a press conference on Wednesday. The visit is

German nationals of Romania in order to decide over new measures 
of aid in the economic, cultural, social and education fields. 
The German delegation will be received by Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu and will have talks with members of the Romanian 
Government. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesperson said also that the German 
minister for economic cooperation Carl-Dieter Spranger would 
visit Romania on May 6-7 at the invitation of the Romanian 
Government in order work out new actions of German support to 
the economic restructuring process in Romania especially in the 
industrial sector. On that occasion, a governmental 
frame-agreement will be signed concerning the technological 
cooperation between Romania and Germany.
