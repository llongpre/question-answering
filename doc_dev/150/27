  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/4/1994 -- The main danger 
threatening Romania is not coming from outside, but rather from 
inside, subversion being one of its forms, Ion Mircea Pascu, 
secretary of state in charge of defense and international 
relations of the Romanian Ministry of Defense, told a news 
conference Friday, 15 April. Subversive acts can be 'canvassed' 
in many ways, he said, by those who pursue such aims. Romania 
does not exclude extraneous danger, although this is less 
poignant at the moment. He said Romania's option is for 
integration in the European structures, and that the Partnership 
for Peace is one step towards that goal. Romania's ultimate 
target in its strive for integration is the forging of a 
European security system comprising all the actors on the 
European political stage, the Russian Federation, the Ukraine, 
the United States, and Canada, inclusively. 
  Related to the problems the Romanian Army is confronted 
with, 
the secretary of state said its endowment and equipment shall be 
done as the budget allocation permits. Although modest, this 
provides for certain growths which will enable the army to 
upgrade medical assistance and housing conditions for the 
military.
