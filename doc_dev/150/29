  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/2/1994 -- "An Arbitrary 
Differentiation That Defies Historical Truth" is the title under 
which the editorial of the daily newspaper DIMINEATA comments 
the recent statements made by the president of the Republic of 
Moldova, Mircea Snegur, relative to the existence of a "Moldovan 
people," allegedly different from the Romanian people. 
  As is known, the Republic of Moldova is inhabited by 64 
percent ethnic Romanians, speakers of a genuine albeit slightly 
archaic Romanian, and live on more than three quarters of what 
used to be the historical Romanian province of Bessarabia, 
annexed in 1940 by the former Soviet Union on the strength of 
the Soviet-German pact signed by the then foreign ministers 
Molotov and Ribbentrop. After the fall at the end of the ninth 
decade of the totalitarian regimes in the East of Europe, more 
and more voices in the Republic of Moldova proclaimed the return 
of this Romanian territory to its mother land Romania. 
  The editorial quoted above cautions that the reoccurrence in 
Snegur's declaration of older theses of the Soviet ideology 
periodically aired, first in the twenties and thirties, then in 
the forties and fifties and in the Brezhnev epoch, which 
advocate a clear distinction between the Romanian people and 
culture and the "Moldovan people and culture." 
  TINERETUL LIBER finds Snegur's attitude as a strategic 
response to Moscow's offensive attempts to regain its commanding 
role over its former republics, but finds no excuse for his 
impudence of "denying his own roots, and doing this on behalf of 
those he is representing." The newspaper terms Bucharest's 
reaction as "still pale" and warns that Romanian should not 
neglect the national interest and overlook the political 
significance and the emotional impact Snegur's statement carries. 
  Under the heading "Romanian Political Circles Vehemently 
Condemn Mircea Snegur's Switch" CURIERUL NATIONAL groups 
opinions by Romanian political forces on Mircea Snegur's 
statements. "Preposterous" is the label applied to them by 
Peasant Party [PNTCD] Vice President Ioan Diaconescu. The 
ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR) finds them 
"inciting and offending," and Romanian National Unity Party 
(PUNR) Vice President Cornel Brahas qualifies them as "an overt 
attempt at our integrity, a tragical treason of the Romanian 
kin." 
  COTIDIANUL defines the lines of action against such 
aberrations in the following terms: "The awareness of the 
physical, spiritual and moral geography, the unharnessing of the 
Romanians' power to create, to give vigour and substance to the 
national idea through the opening toward the European spirit 
have become the commandments of our ties against the dangers 
springing from the rebirth of the Zhirinovskiy-type [Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
imperial nationalism and expansionism."
