  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 28/6/1994 -- For a week the 
city of Cluj-Napoca (North-West of Romania, inhabited by a large 
Hungarian minority) has been living in a state of tension 
created by the conflict between the public authorities and the 
local branch of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania 
(UDMR). 
  The conflict, which is not something new, because such 
situations arose several times in the capital of the historical 
Romanian province of Transylvania, was sparkled by the intention 
of the local authorities to authorize, at the request of the 
Transylvanian History Museum, archaeological diggings in the 
central square of the city where the monument to Hungarian King 
of Romanian descent Matthias Corvinus is located. The local 
branch of UDMR is accusing the City Council, and Mayor Gheorghe 
Funar in the first place, of using the digs as a pretext to move 
Corvinus's statue to another location. 
  "The archaeological diggings planned to start in the Union 
Square of Cluj-Napoca are about 100 meters away from the statue 
of King Matthias Corvinus," the city mayor Gheorghe Funar told 
CRONICA ROMANA. 
  "The UDMR misleads its members, supporters, and the whole 
world, pretending that the unearthings pursue to create a state 
of conflict in the town," Gheorghe Funar also says. His opinion 
is that the tension aroused in the past few days is 
"artificially created, has a political connotation and was 
generated by the UDMR's actions intended to prevent the 
archaeological investigations in the Union Square." He specified 
that the initiative comes from the History Museum of 
Transylvania of Cluj Napoca, which has obtained the approval of 
all the competent fora, and has allotted 10 million lei to the 
project. The mayor himself suggested the local council to 
approve another 30 million lei to sustain the project. 
  Despite assurances from local authorities that Matthias 
Corvinus's statue will have nothing to suffer, "the UDMR 
representatives said they would stage demonstrations and urge to 
civic disobedience, and termed the matter a political issue," 
Gheorghe Funar said. Should any acts of civic disorder appear 
in the town, Gheorghe Funar said he would be the advocate of 
"firm enforcement of the law." 
  The daily ORA carries a commentary in its yesterday's issue 
qualifying the case as part of "the Hungarian concerted strategy 
aimed at having the Trianon Treaty canceled or revised." The 
Treaty of Trianon permitted Transylvania to reunite with the 
mother country after Habsburg and Hungarian occupation was 
abolished. The article in question remarked that "the plan is 
absolutely the same for all the countries having a Hungarian 
minority," and that "from this point of view, UDMR is one of the 
spearheads of this intelligent plan, obstinately followed by 
Budapest." 
  The archaeological investigations due to start next week in 
Cluj-Napoca intend to bring to light the forum of the ancient 
city of Napoca, a Roman colony on the territory of ancient 
Dacia, the cradle of the Romanian people and language. The city 
of Napoca used to be the capital of the Roman Province of Dacia 
Porolisensis, and Cluj-Napoca is celebrating this year 1870 
years from its first documentary attestation.
