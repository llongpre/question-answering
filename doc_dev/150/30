  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/5/1994 -- "The Partnership for 
Peace has a special significance for Romania," Gheorghe Tinca, 
Romanian minister of defense states in an interview with the 
periodical PARLAMENTUL. 
  "We were the first to sign the document-framework," he 
recalls, adding that "Romania's adherence to that programme is 
not only a major step, a stage towards the proper guaranteeing 
of national security, but it comes to answer also our 
determination to fully integrate within European and 
Euro-Atlantic structures, an objective fully embraced by all 
political parties represented in Romania's Parliament. The 
adherence to the Partnership for Peace programme of all 
Romania's neighboring states and their commitment to observe the 
principles of that programme would be able to provide certain 
indirect guarantees for the consolidation of our national 
security. That is why we have insisted on the fact that the 
Partnership for Peace should be open to all states, for we want 
them to take active part in the process initiated by NATO," the 
Romanian minister added. 
  Mentioning that "Romania had already set its aims in the 
process of army restructuring, before the initiation of the 
Partnership for Peace programme, whose aims are similar to the 
programme's objectives," Gheorghe Tinca went on to say that "the 
Romanian military doctrine is traditionally a defensive one, 
which matches the partnership's norms, while as regards the 
army's restructuring, training and techniques, all these are to 
face a process of modernization". 
  "We would say that Romania is viewing the peace partnership 
as an instrument to encourage investments, business, and 
economic development. In fact it is not by mere coincidence 
that simultaneously with the Partnership for Peace much talk is 
done about a Partnership for Prosperity. From the very first 
statements regarding the Partnership for Peace, Romania's 
President Ion Iliescu referred to the need for an economic 
partnership, a concept that should be extended not only to the 
European continent but to the entire world," the Romanian 
minister of defense concluded.
