<F P=106> [From the 15 June Romanian press review] </F>
  [Excerpts] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- The need for a 
balance in the Romanian society, marked these days by extensive 
union protests and the celebration of four years since the 
miners' descent to Bucharest on 14 June are the major themes 
covered by the leading press put out on Wednesday, 15 June. 
  The protest launched at the beginning of this week in 
Bucharest by three major trade union blocs, even if ruled by a 
mostly trade-unionist and commemorative character, have turned 
into a protest against the current leadership. 
  Amid street protests, the unilateral initiative of the 
opposition National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] 
to launch procedures to suspend Romania's President Ion Iliescu 
from his office is one more element to fuel tension in the 
political life, according to the press put out today. 
  Daily CURIERUL NATIONAL considers that the PNTCD's 
initiative 
is not only "a political lesson," but also and especially "a 
lesson of inflexibility and radicalism." The daily remarks that 
the history of the past four years shows, among other things, 
that radicalism and inflexibility "have had no political impact 
on the electorate, but rather on the contrary." Examining the 
potential consequences of the PNTCD's initiative, the cited 
daily estimates that by this "a definite end was put to the 
opposition--leadership dialogue," as it "encouraged the 
conservatory group within the ruling party of Social Democracy 
Party of Romania [PDSR] to assert that the opposition is an 
enemy to fight with" and opened prospects for the ruling party 
to consolidate ties with its current allies. Moreover, the 
daily considers that all these would have as potential 
consequence a speedy access of the National Romanian Unity Party 
[PUNR] to ruling, for under the newly created circumstances, 
this party "seems an ideal partner in governing." 
  Daily DIMINEATA writes that "the initiative launched by 
PNTCD 
leader Corneliu Coposu is in fact his own epitaph." The daily 
notes that it is not a serious fact that the PNTCD leader 
imagined that he could find two thirds of the parliamentarians 
"to embrace his aberration," and that "by this he sets himself 
in the service of our country's enemies, who are now seeing 
themselves with their lands and enterprises returned as their 
property rights." 
  Several dailies publish and comment on the communique issued 
by Romania's presidency in which the accusations brought to 
Romania's number one [President Ion Iliescu] are viewed as 
"ungrounded." [passage omitted] 
  Government daily VOCEA ROMANIEI publishes views of several 
parliamentarians on the initiative launched by the PNTCD leader, 
which they view as "a hit below the belt on democracy," an "at 
least hazardous action," or "a bluff." 
  The dailies also inform that at yesterday's meeting of the 
opposition Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] leaders and 
leaders of the Democratic Party [PD] a conclusion was reached to 
stop the procedure for President Iliescu's suspension from 
office and to invite the president to face Parliament and 
clarify the disputed aspects. This step is viewed by the 
editorialist of daily CRONICA ROMANA as "wise" or as "the most 
logical and democratic alternative under the given 
circumstances." On the other hand, the opposition is furthering 
its radical efforts on the much disputed issue of the draft bill 
on nationalized houses, daily ADEVARUL informing its readers 
that it is possible for the opposition to totally withdraw from 
Parliament, according to an announcement made yesterday by 
Gyorgy Frunda, senator of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania [UDMR]. 
  Under the headline "Union Protests at European Standards," 
government's daily VOCEA ROMANIEI extensively comments on the 
protests launched yesterday in Bucharest. The daily remarks the 
observance of public order, the civilized articulation of the 
various claims, mostly economic ones, and the openness for 
dialogue. Daily CRONICA ROMANA welcomes the fact that no 
violence was used by demonstrators yesterday. [passage omitted]
