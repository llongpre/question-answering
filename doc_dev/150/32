  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 18/4/1994 -- "The talks between 
the foreign ministers of Romania and Armenia pointed to the 
necessity of concluding the soonest a basic political treaty 
between the two countries," said Romanian Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Mircea Geoana at the close of the first round of talks 
between Teodor Melescanu and Vahan Papazyan. It is hoped that 
in a near future that important document will be signed during a 
meeting of the two countries' presidents. 
  The parties informed each other on the situation in Trans- 
Caucasian and the conflict in former Yugoslavia. Papazyan 
referred to the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh and outlined the 
latest developments and initiatives for its settlement. Teodor 
Melescanu outlined Romania's main foreign policy options. He 
presented the stage of Romania's relations with the NATO, the 
European Union, and the neighboring states. 
  During the talks the parties agreed to expand the relations 
of cooperation in the international bodies, especially the CSCE 
and the UN, and at a subregional level, with reference to the 
Black Sea area.
