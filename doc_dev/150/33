  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 23/6/1994 -- The Romanian press 
of the past days comments on the results of an opinion poll 
ordered by the government conducted by the Romanian Institute of 
Public Opinion Polling (IRSOP) in April 1994, and the results of 
which, however, being unfavorable for the government, are being 
kept strictly confidential. 
  According to the poll -- which carries the title National 
Study Regarding Public Perception of Current Social Issues, the 
Government's Eligibility for the People's Favors, and the 
Popularity of Parties and Their Top Politicians -- two thirds of 
the Romanians are not satisfied with President Ion Iliescu's 
performance and view him as not eligible for another mandate in 
office. More than 27 percent are stating in favor of Ion 
Iliescu, considering him still eligible for the presidential 
office. 
  Eight out of ten Romanians are reproaching the president 
with 
not doing anything or doing too little to eliminate corruption 
(83 percent) and for agriculture (81 percent.) Two thirds are 
of the opinion that he does not encourage enough the market 
economy (67 percent) and is bringing a far too tiny contribution 
to the speeding up of privatization. Such opinions are, 
however, revealing that one part of the population has a wrong 
perception regarding the responsibilities of the presidential 
office. 
  Eight out of ten Romanians have a negative view on the 
government (79 percent). The negative views seem to be grounded 
more on the given impression of the government's lack of 
interest for the population, than on the lack of abilities in 
the performance of the executive. Only one out of four 
Romanians (23 percent) is accusing the government of lack of 
competence. With a smaller percentage, namely two out of ten 
Romanians (21 percent) are ready to praise the government and to 
find excuses for its failures, invoking an intervention by 
several forces sabotaging their good intentions. 
  The population's confidence in the political parties is 
pictured as follows: The ruling Social Democracy Party of 
Romania [PDSR] -- 21 percent; the National Peasant 
Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] (opposition) -- 17 percent; 
the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR] (backer of the 
government until recently) -- 8 percent; the Civic Alliance 
Party [PAC] (opposition) - 8 percent; the Democratic Party [PD] 
(opposition) -- 6 percent; the National Romanian Unity Party 
[PUNR] (government backer) -- 6 percent; the Romanian Ecologist 
Party [PER] -- 6 percent; the Liberal Party '93 [PL-93] -- 5 
percent; the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] -- 
5 percent (all opposition forces); the Socialist Party of Labor 
[PSM] -- 4 percent; the Greater Romania Party [PRM] -- 4 percent 
(both government backers); and the Romanian Social-Democratic 
Party [PSDR] -- 1 percent (opposition.) 
  The circumstances under which the poll was leaked to the 
press are still unknown, because its orderer, the Government's 
General Secretariat, did not make an official release of the 
document, while the executive has neither denied nor confirmed 
speculations of the press.
