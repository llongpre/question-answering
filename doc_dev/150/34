  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu received Thursday, 9 June, the Chinese minister of 
the machine-building industry He Guangyuan, head of his 
country's delegation to the 12th session of the Romanian-Chinese 
Joint Governmental Committee on Economic and Technical 
Cooperation, held these days in Bucharest. 
  At the close of the interview, the guest was appreciative of 
the progress made by the Romanian-Chinese relations, and quoted 
President Iliescu as saying that the Romanian side hoped the 
economic cooperation with China would open better trade 
opportunities to Romanian and Chinese firms. Minister Guangyuan 
anticipated that the visit of Premier Li Peng next month to 
Romania will give a greater impetus to the relations between the 
two countries.
