  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 10/5/1994 -- Romanian Minister 
of State Mircea Cosea appreciated as a success the stabilization 
of the leu exchange rate reached in April as much valuable as it 
had been achieved without "traumas or big commotions." In an 
interview with the Romania Radio, Vacaroiu cabinet's reform 
minister Mircea Cosea said the stabilization process would 
continue till June, the current year, when the inter-bank market 
is scheduled to be established. Cosea opined the success 
belonged to a fruitful cooperation between Government and the 
National Bank of Romania "extremely well valued abroad" and the 
"final" condition on the IMF stand-by loan. 
  Referring to the stage of privatization, Cosea said the 
so-called "30 percent" action would be finalized within the 
current month. The action will consist in the population's 
exchanging their property certificates -- previously granted to 
the population -- for shares in the commercial state companies 
amounting up to a total value of 30 percent of the commercial 
companies' aggregate capital. The Governmental Council of 
Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform -- headed by Cosea 
-- together with the National Privatization Agency, State 
Property Fund, and the (five) Private Property Funds are drawing 
up the details of the stock public offering. 
  Mircea Cosea gave as a proof of the increasing international 
recognition of the economic reform in Romania the invitation he 
had received in order to open and lead a conference organized by 
the specialized commission of the European Union for issues 
concerning the small and middle-sized enterprises.
