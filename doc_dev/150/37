  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/04/1994 -- "Romania has the 
capacity to employ its own potential," said Romanian minister of 
state, head of the Council of Economic Coordination, Strategy 
and Reform, in an interview granted to the governmental daily 
VOCEA ROMANIEI. 
  "The market economy is not a goal, an objective," says 
Cosea, 
but it must be considered as "a way to organize production and 
consumption based on relations of equivalent exchanges." 
Minister Cosea opined that Romania should consider the projects 
for the future according to the objectives it wish to reach. 
The development, as a goal, "depends on a country's capacity of 
employing the potential it has and, in this respect, few 
countries have this capacity that Romania has." 
  Minister Cosea said also that the reform in Romania was "an 
action of updating and civilizing which entails time and 
efforts. Still, the reform must be, in the end, visible and 
perceptible at the level of the individual" and not reduced to 
some statistical figures with regard to the pace of the 
privatization. "If it does not bring a change in the life of the 
individual, in his life in the society, the reform has no 
motivation." Reviewing the past four years of reform, Mircea 
Cosea concluded that the single change in the life of the 
individual was only a "permanent stress caused by the vanishing 
of the old values." 
  The reform, Cosea opined, should lead to the healing of the 
Romanian individual from two maladies he suffered from very much 
in the communist regime, namely, "the apathy, lack of 
determination," and "a certain underestimation of the country 
and of the people he belongs to in favor of foreign values, 
usually Western ones." Mircea Cosea said that at the time being 
Romania needed "a well structured system of values" and "a 
revigoration of the real, genuine patriotism which means one's 
faith that he belong to a valuable and strong nation." These can 
be achieved, Cosea considers, through the economic factor. When 
the Romanians would be able to live a better life, they will 
abandon the tendency of over-estimating the values of other 
peoples only because of their higher living standard, believes 
Cosea. 
  Referring to the privatization issues of primary concern in 
1994, Mircea Cosea warned that "privatization is not a reform 
element in itself but a single step which must be taken in the 
economic and social field." Minister Cosea said also that 
because of the way privatization has been made from 1990 till 
now, it is no longer perceived by the public as a reform element 
but as "a collective trauma." In this respect, Cosea mentioned 
certain abuses, elements of corruption, in the first years of 
the privatization process.
