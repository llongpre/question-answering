  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 29/3/1994 -- We had talks on 
resuming and enlarging Romanian-Russian ties in all fields, 
which meets the interests of both parties, said Premier Nicolae 
Vacaroiu after his Tuesday, March 29, interview with the Russian 
minister of defence Pavel Grachev. Vacaroiu showed satisfaction 
at the signing of the military cooperation agreement between 
Romania and Russia. 
  The Russian guest revealed, for his part, the importance of 
the process of rebuilding a basis of cooperation between the two 
countries and mentioned that the agreement signed on the 
occasion of his visit provided a basis for cooperation in the 
defence industry, the training of Romanian officers in Russia, 
military drilling carried out jointly by the two countries, 
swaps of experts. 
  Opinions were also exchanged on the current economic and 
social situation of the two countries. Similarities were 
identified in most aspects reviewed, which made the two parties 
deem that efficient partnership in all the fields of interest 
for the two sides could be beneficial for both Romania and 
Russia. 
  Premier Vacaroiu was hopeful that the visit of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to Romania, likely to take place this 
year, could mark a step further in strengthening 
Romanian-Russian links. 
  Attending were Romanian Minister of Defence Gheorghe Tinca 
and Secretary of State Ioan Mircea Pascu.
