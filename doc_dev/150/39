  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 10/5/1994 -- In the evening of 
10 May President Ion Iliescu of Romania offered an official 
dinner in honor of Albanian President Sali Berisha and of the 
delegation that accompanied him on his visit to Bucharest. On 
this occasion Presidents Ion Iliescu and Sali Berisha held 
toasts. 
  In his toast, the head of the Romanian state said that 
"after 
the instatement of democratic regimes in our countries, 
favorable conditions were put in place for the Romanian-Albanian 
relations." In his opinion, the political treaty and the other 
cooperation documents to be signed during the Albanian 
president's visit express the political will of the sides for a 
fruitful long-term cooperation. 
  Mentioning Romania and Albania's concern about the conflict 
tearing apart the former Yugoslav space, the head of the 
Romanian state said: "It is sad that momentary circumstances, 
generated by the dismemberment of former Yugoslavia, that 
certain resentments, some of them probably motivated, should lie 
at the root of a tragedy and be now the greatest hurdle in the 
way of a political settlement in the area." The Romanian 
president underlined that Romania pronounces for a rational and 
responsible attitude on the part of all the leading factors in 
the area so that confrontation is renounced. President Iliescu 
pleaded for further support to the efforts of the international 
community in achieving peace. "The alternative to peace, to 
dialogue is cannot be but the extension of the conflict with 
enormous suffering for the peoples of former Yugoslavia and the 
risk of involving other states," the president of Romania said, 
who also reiterated Romania's "firm support for the actions 
directed towards finding a political solution, for the 
reinstatement of trust and understanding." "We wish to give the 
Romanian-Albanian relations a new impetus, to act in such a way 
as to forge exemplary economic, political, cultural, and 
spiritual ties between our peoples," the president of Romania 
also said.
