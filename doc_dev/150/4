  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 13/6/1994 -- The transition 
process has inevitably diminished Romania's capacity to ensure 
its own security. Romania does not have, as at now, allies and 
firm security guarantees. The main danger lies in having its 
own domestic weaknesses exploited. There is a direct 
relationship between the reform and the national security. 
These are some of the main ideas Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary 
of state in the Romanian Ministry of National Defense, 
elaborated on in the comprehensive interview for the CURIERUL 
NATIONAL of 13 June. 
  Speaking of the integrated concept of Romania's national 
security, a recently issued document, Pascu says the study ends 
with the basic conclusion that for now and for a while to come, 
"Romania cannot rely on allies and firm security guarantees." 
Besides, the transition from one type of society to another has 
diminished its capacity to ensure security by its own means, 
"particularly as we are located in an area characterized by a 
high degree of conflict potential." 
  In Mr. Pascu's opinion, the most important sign of Romania's 
insecurity since December 1989 is the very fact that threats are 
no longer mostly external, and that "the main danger is posed by 
the possibility of having its domestic weaknesses exploited." 
And among the main internal risk factors he listed the economic 
situation, the social costs required by the changes brought 
about by the transition period, a diminished social cohesion etc. 
  To face the domestic risk factors this country needs to 
ensure the continuity of the reform process: "the success of the 
reform, however cannot be obtained in the absence of security, 
and to have security, we need to take the reform to the end 
successfully." 
  The defense official also mentioned some of the external 
risk 
factors for Romania's security, such as the appearance and 
worsening of certain conflicts, the existence of zones with a 
high potential of political and military instability close to 
Romania. 
  As directly concerning Romania's security, Secretary of 
State 
Mircea Pascu names international developments like the recent 
stability plan adopted in Paris, the agreement for the reduction 
of the conventional armaments and troops in Europe, the 
Partnership for Peace plan, Romania's geopolitical position, the 
relations with Russia. 
  Concluding, the dignitary predicted about the future of 
Romania's security in the following terms: "If we ignore the 
unpredictable, which, unfortunately, will continue to be there 
both in the near and medium future, I think we can be optimistic 
about Romania's long- term chances of integration in the 
European and Euro-Atlantic security systems."
