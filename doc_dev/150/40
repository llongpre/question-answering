  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 25/2/1994 -- "Any government in 
Romania must be a government for reform, and this necessarily 
implies a wide political and social support," President Ion 
Iliescu of Romania told the daily newspaper ADEVARUL. Asked 
whether he had any preferences for the government to be 
appointed after 1 March, the president of Romania said that he, 
personally, had no preference, and that he would like "a 
government enjoying some stability and enough parliamentary 
support." He underlined the distinction that should be made 
between "a political agreement between the political parties 
forming the parliament" and the "possible structure of a 
government." In this latter case a government, the president 
opined, "could be formed solely of technocrats or of 
representatives of a single political party, but only based on a 
political formula of a wider parliamentary support." 
  About the much vented version of holding early elections, 
Romania's number one said that such an alternative would not be 
the best for Romania, because an election campaign at the moment 
would only "disturb public life." However, theoretically 
speaking, early elections "could be a solution unless others are 
found." President Iliescu's opinion is that in 1994 the 
Romanian society should concentrate its efforts on surmounting 
the crisis and on economic reconstruction. "No matter what 
governments will succeed one another, Romania's problems will be 
the same," the president of Romania said. 
  As already widely reflected by the press, President Ion 
Iliescu had consultations with all the parliamentary parties 
with the aim of reaching a political pact aimed at reinstating a 
climate for dialogue between the political forces and at 
building a minimal common platform for taking the economic 
reform further. The first round of consultations ended in 
mid-January. Their resumption depends on the joint agreement of 
all parties involved.
