  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 26/1/1994 -- Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu signed on Wednesday afternoon [26 
January] the framework document concerning Romania's 
participation in the Partnership for Peace, an initiative 
launched at the NATO summit on January 10-11. The signing 
ceremony which took place in the NATO Council room was attended 
by NATO Assistant Secretary General Amedeo de Franchis and by 
the permanent representatives to the North Atlantic Council of 
the 16 member countries. 
  Due to this political act, which succeeds the acceptance of 
the invitation to the Partnership for Peace expressed by 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu in a statement on January 11, 
Romania has become officially the first country to be engaged in 
the new cooperation pattern with the NATO. 
  At the signing ceremony, Amedeo de Franchis and Teodor 
Melescanu read out brief speeches stressing the political 
significance of the moment and expressing hope that the 
Partnership for Peace would contribute to the consolidation of 
the security and stability in whole Europe. Romanian Foreign 
Minister Melescanu underlined that Romania committed itself with 
all faith and responsibility to the new relation with NATO and 
with the NATO member countries, a relation considered by Romania 
as a preliminary and preparatory stage to Romania's future 
membership to NATO's political and military structures. 
  Previous to the signing ceremony, the Romanian minister of 
foreign affairs had an interview with Amedeo de Franchis and met 
also with the permanent representatives to the North Atlantic 
Council of the 16 NATO member countries. 
  The NATO Assistant Secretary General Amedeo de Franchis 
saluted the "historic moment" when Romania became the first 
"cooperation partner" of the alliance, through the signing the 
framework document of the Partnership for Peace. 
  In a speech on Wednesday in Brussels, in the presence of 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, the NATO assistant 
secretary general praised the courage and decision proven by the 
Romanian people in his fight for liberty. Today, Romania 
experiences a difficult process of political and economic reform 
in the interior but, at the same time, it works for the creation 
of new security relations in the exterior, said Amedeo de 
Franchis.
