  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 12/1/1994 -- Referring to the 
steps taken by the county council chairmen of Satu Mare and 
Maramures Counties for adhesion to the Euro-Carpathian Region 
and to Ukraine's initiative to include the Romanian counties of 
Botosani and Suceava in the same organization, Romanian Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Mircea Geoana emphasized the following things 
at the news briefing of January 12: 
  "In the first case, the issue has two aspects: A legal and a 
political one. As concerns the legal aspect, the things are 
clear: The two chairmen of county councils were not empowered to 
sign a possible adhesion. As for the political aspect 
concerning the future of Europe, the enhancement of integration 
and stability on the continent and in our region, this kind of 
cooperation at the level of localities or territorial 
administrative units is a viable formula. The problem consists 
only of the manner of delimitation of the area in which this 
organization is functioning. We want to be sure that such steps 
do not conceal also things contrary to the European 
organizations' generous and noble purpose of securing the 
states' cooperation and prosperity. Ukraine's efforts to 
include in the Euro-Carpathian Region two counties of Romania -- 
Botosani and Suceava --, where the numbers of the Ukrainian 
minority are rather inconsequential, means a stand taken by the 
Ukrainian Government precisely on this preoccupation of ours. 
The possibility of Romania's participation in the 
Euro-Carpathian Region or in other forms of similar cooperation 
has been under the foreign ministry's consideration," spokesman 
Mircea Geoana said.
