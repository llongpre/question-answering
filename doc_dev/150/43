  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 19/1/1994 -- "The problem of 
Romanians in other countries, including the Romanians living in 
Ukraine and Hungary, is of concern to the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry and it can be settled only in the natural framework of 
human rights, starting from the generally acknowledged measures 
elaborated within the United Nations, CSCE and the Council of 
Europe", said Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu in an 
interview with daily JURNAL NATIONAL. "The Romanian state 
campaigns for the strict observance of the norms of 
international law and of the international standards regarding 
the minorities and makes every effort to secure the rights of 
national minorities in Romania." Teodor Melescanu mentioned 
that "as seen by the Romanian Foreign Ministry, the principle of 
truthfulness and respect of the Romanians living abroad to the 
states whose citizens they are make the keystone of our policy 
with the communities of Romanians everywhere and the way to 
follow in order to avoid any tension and disagreement in 
bilateral relations with other countries". 
  As regards Ukraine, the Romanian chief diplomat opined that 
"the emotional side and the sensitiveness of the situation of 
the Romanian population in that neighbor country consequent to 
the tragic events generated by the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact 
(1939), necessarily require the further taking of steps apt to 
secure conditions for the preservation, expression and 
development of national, linguistic, cultural and religious 
identity of the Romanians". In this respect, Melescanu 
stressed: "We assess as necessary the improvement and 
development of the tuition in Romanian existing in that country, 
the provision of facilities for the training in Romania of 
teaching staff and experts from among Romanian ethnics, the 
granting of assistance in setting up libraries, clubs, 
publishing houses, printing houses for Romanian- language 
publications, the redemption of buildings that belonged to 
Romanian spirituality, the securing of free flow of persons, 
especially for the youth who want to learn in Romania. I cannot 
watch indifferently the degradation or destruction of Romanian 
vestiges and historical monuments in Ukraine's territory and the 
measures that prevent the free expression of the Romanians' 
opinions, as is the case of the PLAI ROMANESC [ROMANIAN LAND] 
newspaper", said Teodor Melescanu. He stressed that "the 
problems of the situation of Romanians in Ukraine and of 
Ukrainians in Romania are a matter of official talks at the 
level of the two Foreign Ministries pursuing the signing of 
official documents". 
  The territories in today's Ukraine inhabited by Romanians 
are 
parts of Bessarabia and Bucovina -- ancient Romanian territories 
-- annexed by the former USSR in 1940 pursuant to the 
Ribbentrop- Molotov pact which has been disavowed these last few 
years.
