  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/5/1994 -- Radu Campeanu has 
been acknowledged as legitimate president of the National 
Liberal Party (PNL) by virtue of a court sentence passed 
yesterday, 3 May, by the Bucharest Municipal Court, which ruled 
against a similar claim by the group led by Mircea 
Ionescu-Quintus. 
  The conflict between the two factions of the PNL, generated 
by the wish to reign supreme in the liberal movement, opposes 
Radu Campeanu, liberal member in the 1940's, repatriated in 1990 
after years of residence in France, who held the PNL 
chairmanship over 1990-1993, and ran for the presidency of 
Romania in 1990, to Mircea Ionescu-Quintus, lawyer and writer, 
liberal minister of justice in Mr. Theodor Stolojan's cabinet, 
1991-1992. 
  The conflict and tensions between these two factions and 
between them and other liberal splinter groups have inflicted, 
commentators observe, a negative image on Romania's main liberal 
party, which the 1990 elections had earned an important number 
of seats in the Parliament that functioned until the next 
elections of 1992 when it failed to gain the minimal share of 
votes for parliamentary representation. At that time, liberal 
leaders blamed the failure on Radu Campeanu's strong ego, who on 
the one hand decided to withdraw from the principal opposition 
bloc known as the Democratic Convention of Romania (CDR) and on 
the other blundered tragically proposing the former sovereign of 
Romania, Mihai I, who abdicated in 1947, as candidate for 
presidency, both moves meeting popular disagreement. 
  Starting from February 1994, PNL has had a bi-cephalous 
leadership, one being Mircea Ionescu-Quintus, elected PNL 
president in 1993, and the other Radu Campeanu, whom the 
"Campeanu" grouping designated as president of the National 
Liberal Party at an extraordinary congress. After this the 
story started of what the press called "the fight for the 
party's stamp" and the fight for the Bucharest central seat of 
the party, until the sides turned to the law for a verdict. 
  The resolution made yesterday by the Bucharest Municipal 
Court is practically the rejection of a contention lodged by the 
Quintus wing against a previous resolution. Mr. Quintus's group 
announced last evening that they would not abandon legal actions 
until the situation of the PNL was clarified and intimated that 
many PNL branches had extended them their support.
