  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- "Romania's 
integration in the European political, economic, and military 
structures is one of the main directions of the Romanian foreign 
policy. Its essence lies in a process of modernization devised 
to include the army too, so that this could become a modern 
army," National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca told a ROMPRES 
correspondent. This line of policy finds its reflection in the 
principles of military diplomacy, which mirror the efforts to 
develop bilateral relations with the armies of other states. 
Very soon, the Romanian minister said, he will be on a visit to 
Great Britain, and arrangements are being made for similar tours 
to the U.S.A., probably in July, and to Portugal. There are also 
invitations to Spain, Albania, Egypt, Qatar, and other 
countries. He mentioned also the neighboring countries with 
which "Romania has lately concluded a well defined chapter," the 
Romanian minister said. 
  Another dimension of the Romanian military diplomacy is the 
Partnership for Peace, meant to consolidate stability in our 
region, and wider yet, in the European region. 
  "Whenever we speak of integration, we must also specify what 
we want to integrate into, and that is in the partnership with 
NATO, an alliance which, after the cessation of the cold war, 
proved viable and apt to ensure a climate of security." 
  In the opinion of the Romanian defense minister, "the North- 
Atlantic alliance should undergo certain changes, now that the 
other pole of rivalry has ceased to exist, and find itself a new 
logic, the logic of collective gain. Confrontation will have to 
be replaced with something else, perhaps with cooperation." 
  While pleading for a partnership formula open to all states 
and stressing the idea of equal security for all European states 
and of sovereignty and independence of their decisions for all 
the countries included in the partnership program, the Romanian 
minister said that such a formula could contribute to defining a 
system of general security, which, based on what already forms 
the skeleton of NATO, could "form the necessary security 
umbrella apt to encourage a course to prosperity in this part of 
Europe, too," Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca said.
