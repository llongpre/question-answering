Unity Party [PUNR] and the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] 4 
percent each, the Democratic Party [PD] and the Greater Romania 
Party [PRM] 3 percent each, and the Democratic Agrarian Party of 
Romania [PDAR] 2 percent. 
  The majority of the population considers that the following 
things worsened: The living standard, the observance of public 
order and law, and the people's trust in the future.

Curbing inflation, creation of jobs, issuance and handing over
