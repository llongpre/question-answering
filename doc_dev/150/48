<F P=106> ["Romanian President's Letter to the Heads of State or </F>
Government of the NATO Member Countries and to the NATO General 
Secretariat" -- ROMPRES headline] 
  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/1/1994 -- "Before the high 
level meeting of the NATO countries scheduled for 10 January 
1994, I should like to reassert Romania's position on the 
alliance and reconfirm the constant interest of my country to 
become a full member of the organization. I have expressed this 
interest on various occasions, including in the letter I 
addressed on 18 September 1993 to the NATO General Secretariat, 
to Mr. Manfred Woerner. 
  "Romania considers the North Atlantic Alliance, that has 
proved its ability to adjust to the new realities emerged after 
the close of the Cold War, as being the only organization apt to 
ensure stability on the European continent and guarantee the 
values of democracy and the state of law. 
  "I have received with special interest the `Partnership for 
Peace' proposal, perceived in Romania as being an important 
preliminary stage in the process of the country's full 
integration into the NATO structures. My country has shown 
willing to participate in this new form of cooperation, with 
respect of the requirements imposed by the status of member of 
the alliance. 
  "I would like to use this occasion to reassert Romania's 
strong conviction that, as an European state, it has a rightful 
place into NATO. 
  "In analyzing our request, please take into account 
Romania's 
vital interests of security, that have been given new dimensions 
following the recent political developments in the areas in the 
proximity of my country. 
  "Moreover, Romania is resolute to get more actively involved 
in ensuring stability in the region and in Europe in general, it 
is willing to assume all responsibilities it would have as a 
member of the alliance. 
  "I am sure that Romania's integration into NATO would offer 
us security guarantees absolutely necessary to create conditions 
adequate for translation into practice the democratic 
transformations and the economic reform Romania has firmly 
committed to. 
  "In my outlook, to be a member of NATO is an essential 
constituent of the global process of integration of Romania in 
Euro-Atlantic structures (NATO, WEU [Western European Union], 
the European Union, and the Council of Europe), this is the 
essential objective of the Romanian foreign policy. 
  "I hope that during the debates to be held at the high level 
meeting in Brussels you will consider the position of my 
country, on which all political parties in Romania's Parliament, 
the whole Romanian people, have agreed."
