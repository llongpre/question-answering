  [Excerpts] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 2/3/1994 -- Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Mircea Geoana announced at the today's news 
conference President Ion Iliescu's unofficial visit to China on 
11-14 March this year at the invitation of the Chinese 
Government. The Romanian president will be shown the special 
economic zones in the South of China, Shen Zhen and Zhu Hai, the 
Quandong Canton Province where, the Romanian delegation will 
meet with the local administration. The president will be 
accompanied by a group of Romanian businessmen, executives of 
state and private companies, and will examine the prospects of 
cooperation between the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry read a communique at 
a 
Wednesday, March 2, press conference, saying that the Romanian 
Foreign Ministry has taken note with satisfaction of the 
agreement on the creation of a Croatian-Muslim Federation in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and of a confederation made up of the said 
federation and Croatia. The Romanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs considers that the putting in place of the provisions of 
this accord would represent an important step in finding a 
political solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 
parallel with solutions for the other problems under 
negotiation. The Foreign Ministry expresses hope that this 
favorable moment will be made good use of in the interest of all 
the parties, of stability and security in the region, reads the 
communique. 
  The relations between Romania and Moldova are not function 
of 
the electoral cycle, which was already proved when elections 
were held in Romania, said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mircea 
Geoana at his Wednesday, March 2, press conference, speaking 
about the elections held in the Republic of Moldova on February 
27. 
  The results of the polls reflect the state of mind of the 
population and they can be interpreted in terms of the economic 
and social difficulties confronting the Republic of Moldova, of 
the way in which the electorate took those aspects of the 
programmes of the parties running for seats in parliament that 
refer to the current situation of the country, mentioned the 
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. An evaluation of the 
results has to take into account the conditions specific to the 
Republic of Moldova, the tensions appeared in consequence of the 
situation in Dniester and the districts inhabited by Gagauz, the 
general evolutions in the former Soviet space. "That is how the 
option for the left can be explained, the relative high percent 
of vote got by the bloc formed of the Socialist Party (the 
former Communist Party) and the "unity" party. It is 
interesting to mention, nevertheless, that the Democratic 
Agrarian Party had the biggest number of seats in the previous 
parliament and it has preserved its position, added Geoana. 
  At the 2 March weekly news conference of the Romanian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Spokesman Mircea Geoana referred to 
the statement of 28 February of the Council of Representatives 
of the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania (UDMR), issued as a 
follow-up and in response to a letter sent to this body by 
Bishop Laszlo Tokes. The spokesman said that the letter 
confirms, once again, the extremist and anti-Romanian angle from 
which Pastor Tokes, encouraged by some UDMR leaders and 
political persons in Hungary, approaches his relations with the 
Romanian state and with UDMR itself. 
  "We express the hope that the UDMR leaders will distance 
themselves from the positions of the honorary president of their 
party, in whose view at present in Romania Ceausescu's policies 
on minorities are being continued. It is only to be regretted 
that the declaration issued by the UDMR's Council of 
Representatives practically reiterates all the accusations 
listed in the instruction-letter of Pastor Tokes. UDMR's 
declaration is accusing the Romanian authorities of lacking the 
political will to implement the amendments of the Council of 
Europe. We think it is high time UDMR understood that the 
addressee of these amendments is the Romanian society as a whole 
and that the observance of the commitments made before the 
Council on Romania's admission to it is a matter of national 
interest," the spokesman said. He also stressed that the 
withdrawal of UDMR from the Council for Ethnic Minorities -- the 
place where it would be but natural that such problems were 
debated -- reveals the lack of both real interest and pragmatism 
in solving them, and lack of consideration for the interests and 
role of the other ethnic minorities in Romania. 
  "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the confidence 
that, joining the competent institutions in the rapid 
finalization of this process, all the forces interested in 
proving the democratic propensity and realities of Romania will 
bring a constructive and sincere contribution," the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman concluded.
