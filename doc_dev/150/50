  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/4/1994 -- After significant 
contacts with Romanian officials and a concert at Radio Hall 
conducted by Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, the chief 
diplomat was received by Romanian president Ion Iliescu on 8 
April at the Cotroceni Palace. 
  Summing up his discussion with the Romanian head of state 
and 
other officials, Willy Claes said that the political statement 
he signed in Bucharest offered a framework "comprehensive 
enough" to allow for the development of relations, especially 
legal and economic. The Belgian foreign minister said that when 
there are sufficient guarantees of stability in Romania, Belgian 
investors would not hesitate to do business in Romania. 
  The same day, the Belgian foreign minister had an interview 
with Chamber of Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase, during which he 
said Western Europe did not intend to treat countries in Central 
and Eastern Europe differently than any others. 
  Minister Willy Claes had to cut his Romanian visit short 
because of recent events in Rwanda which cost the lives of 
several Belgian UN officers stationed in that country. He left 
Romania in the afternoon of April 8.
