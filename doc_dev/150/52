  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 5/1/1994 -- "The Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], that assumed the 
responsibility of ruling the country in these difficult moments 
of crisis, is keen on reaffirming on this occasion as well that 
Romania's integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures is a 
fundamental objective of our foreign policy," reads a communique 
released in Bucharest on 5 January. "From this position, PDSR 
fully backs the official efforts Romania is making to become a 
member of the North Atlantic Alliance. PDSR salutes the 
initiative of Romania's President Ion Iliescu to address on 24 
December a letter to the heads of states or governments of the 
NATO member states, before the upcoming meeting of the alliance, 
reconfirming Romania's constant interest to become a full member 
of the NATO structures. 
  PDSR took note with satisfaction of the recent declarations 
of high officials in the U.S. Administration, according to whom 
"the Partnership for Peace" is for the budding democracies in 
Europe, Romania included, a first step in the process of their 
integration in the NATO structures and a guarantee of security 
at the same time. We are sure that under the conditions of the 
political developments in our proximity, NATO will be in a 
position to offer security guarantees to Romania, necessary for 
preserving its national being and ensuring conditions for 
carrying the democratic transformations the Romanian people has 
committed to since the December 1989 revolution. 
  On the eve of the Brussels meeting of the NATO countries, 
PDSR expresses hope that Romania's security interests will 
resonate with the leaders of the NATO member states, that no 
discriminatory practices will be accepted concerning the 
countries interested to enter the Euro-Atlantic structures. At 
the same time, we understand the concerns repeatedly expressed 
by the U.S. Administration and other NATO member countries for 
not isolating Russia and for taking into account its security 
interests, without prejudicing in this way Romania's security 
interests."
