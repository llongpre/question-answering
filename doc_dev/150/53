  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/4/1994 -- "We have spent 48 
hours in Romania and we have noted that you have all the 
necessary elements for success. You have a big potential but a 
greater support is needed from the part of the Romanians living 
abroad, especially in the United States, said the minister of 
foreign affairs of El Salvador, Miguel Angel Salaverria, after a 
round of talks with the head of the Romanian diplomacy, Teodor 
Melescanu, on Monday, April 4. 
  One of the main theme approached during the talks referred 
to 
the concrete cooperation in the economic field between the two 
countries, said the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, Teodor 
Melescanu. 
  The Romanian party underscored its economic potential in 
several fields of interest for El Salvador, especially the 
textiles, electric energy, petro-chemistry, and expressed its 
readiness to participate, once the issue of the financial 
sources is solved, said Melescanu. 
  In the context, the two parties analysed the idea of opening 
a Romanian economic mission in El Salvador. 
  The two parties debated issues concerning the regional 
relations in Eastern Europe as well as in Central America. 
  A second round of talks between the two foreign ministers is 
scheduled for Monday afternoon when an accord is going to be 
signed thus canceling the requirement of visas on diplomatic and 
service passports. The two ministers will sign also a 
memorandum concerning a consultations mechanism to be 
established between the two foreign ministries. 
  The minister of foreign affairs of El Salvador, Miguel Angel 
Salaverria, was received on Monday by Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu. 
  The Salvadorean guest conveyed to the Romanian head of state 
"a warm message" from the part of Salvadorean President Alfredo 
Cristiani, expressing the desire for strengthened cooperation 
between El Salvador and Romania. 
  The Salvadorean dignitary, who is making a several days long 
private visit in Romania, was pleasantly impressed by the 
contacts he had had here. The democratic future of Romania is 
secure, said the Salvadorean minister. 
  The Salvadorean minister referred also to the future of the 
diplomatic relations between the two countries -- a Salvadorean 
ambassador for Romania is planned to be based in Rome -- as well 
as to the possibilities for joint actions in the economic field 
to which Romania could participate with technology while El 
Salvador with work force and capital.
