  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 30/3/1994 -- "We are going to 
visit a country that we have specially good relations with," 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu told the press at the Otopeni 
airport on his departure for a two-day visit to Greece. 
  Evoking the traditional relations between the two countries, 
President Ion Iliescu said that Romania and Greece were 
promoting the Balkan collaboration and understanding and 
reminded that the relations between the two countries had 
continuously developed since the December 1989 revolution in 
Romania, as Romania and Greece were tied not only through mutual 
interests in the zone. 
  The agenda of the visit includes talks with Greek President 
Konstandinos Karamanlis, with Premier Andreas Papandreou, with 
representatives of political parties in the Greek Parliament, 
the first European parliament to have ratified Romania's 
association to the European Union, as well as with Greek 
businessmen.
