  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 24/3/1994 -- The Romanian and 
Turkish foreign ministers, Teodor Melescanu and Hikmet Cetin had 
a round of talks in Bucharest, on 24 March. They focussed on 
international issues, Balkan ones in particular, with special 
stress on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said the Turkish 
guest at the close of the talks. The Turkish foreign minister 
enlarged on the appeal launched by President Suleyman Demirel 
today before Romania's Parliament, an appeal addressed to 
Bosnian Serbs to find a way to adhere to a confederation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Also, the stage of the relations between the two countries 
and their neighbours was surveyed, in Romania's case with 
Hungary and Ukraine, and in Turkey's case with Greece and the 
states in the Caucasian ex-Soviet region, as well as the two 
countries' relations with the European Union from the angle of 
the Union's extension with new members. 
  Turkey's unconditional support was reiterated to Romania in 
the process of integration in the NATO, the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana said at the end of the round of 
talks.
