  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/3/1994 -- With regard to the 
visit in Romania made by some Hungarian dignitaries, the speaker 
of the Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase told ROMPRES: 
  "The Hungarian dignitaries' visit in Romania has a certain 
degree of ambiguity which we have failed to remove yet. It is 
mainly the fault of the Romanian authorities who have not proven 
the firmness necessary in such occasions. If Mr. Geza Entz 
comes as a private person then he should eventually follow a 
tourism program but in no way should he get involved in public 
actions, attend political meetings, hand medals. Such kind of 
things can be made only in cooperation with the Romanian 
authorities, within an official visit. I believe that this time 
some measures must be taken. If the government fails to take 
these measures, then it exposes itself to some grounded 
criticism." 
  "An electoral campaign is taking place in Hungary for the 
elections of the following months but the campaign should not be 
extended in Romania and in no way should the Hungarian 
dignitaries, especially those from the office for the Hungarians 
abroad led by Geza Entz, carry out electoral campaign activities 
in the neighbouring countries." 
  "In my opinion, it is necessary that the Romanian Ministry 
of 
Foreign Affairs instate a requirement for visas on diplomatic 
passports belonging to Hungarian citizens, such that, when 
somebody comes to Romania under a diplomatic passport, he should 
not 'sneak into' a tourism visit sheltered by the diplomatic 
passport but actually carrying out official actions." 
  "It is therefore necessary that due visas be required in the 
relations with Hungarian officials such that to teach the ones 
who have not understood it very well yet what the Romanian 
state's sovereignty over its entire territory means," said the 
Chamber of Deputies' Speaker Adrian Nastase.
