  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu received Monday, April 11, Colombian Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin Posada. The stage of Romanian-Colombian 
ties was examined, the way in which projects were fulfilled 
agreed on in the summer of 1993, when Romania's president paid a 
visit to Colombia. 
  The interview occasioned talks on bilateral projects of 
interest and an exchange of opinions on the situation in 
Romania's area. Colombia is interested to enter the 
East-European economic market. President Ion Iliescu spoke to 
the Colombian guest about the economic prospects of his country 
for the period to come. 
  The agreements of scientific and cultural cooperation 
between 
Romania and Colombia are to be followed by commercial, 
interbanking and air transport accords, that are going to 
complete the legal framework necessary for the development of 
bilateral links, Romanian Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu and Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin Posada showed in their Monday, 
April 11 interview. 
  The prime minister proposed, in the presence of Romania's 
Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, that a Chamber of Commerce be 
set up in the month of May, when the Colombian minister of trade 
is scheduled to visit Bucharest, with a view to turn to good 
account projects that have already been sketched, such as the 
production in Romania of sugar and juices. 
  Mrs. Sanin specified that her people was viewing Romania as 
its closest friend in this geographic area. She opined that 
Romania could become one of the main distributors of Colombian 
products in Europe, that a swap of experience and cooperation 
between the two sides could be beneficial for both of them. 
  Premier Vacaroiu was pleased to accept the invitation to 
make 
a visit to Colombia, extended by Foreign Minister Sanin. 
  The minister of foreign relations of the Republic of 
Colombia, Noemi Sanin Posada ended Monday, 11 April, her 
official visit to Romania. On leaving, Mrs. Posada told the 
press that her visit had excellent results, and that her talks 
with the Romanian officials were extremely productive. 
  The Romanian-Colombian cooperation must be boosted mostly in 
what economic ties are concerned, the chief of the Colombian 
diplomacy said, and said her country's minister of foreign trade 
was to visit Romania soon. "We want to import from Romania as 
many cars and steel products as possible, and hope that 
companies in our countries go into closer relations," she said.
