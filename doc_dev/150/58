<F P=106> ["M.P."-signed report: "Name Sign Scandal in Transylvania, </F>
Too"] 
  [Text] On 21 June in Mures county, county police and road 
maintenance workers knocked down and smashed bilingual 
(Hungarian- Romanian) signs on the order of the prefect. Law 
enforcement units entered the private territories where the 
bilingual signs were located without the permission or agreement 
of the owners. 
  The police removed signs in more than 20 localities in Mures 
county. The statement of the county organization of the 
Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in 
Romanian] published on 22 June condemns the anti-Hungarian 
provocation in Mures county. The statement specially emphasizes 
the Council of Europe documents and recommendations the Romanian 
government undertook to observe and whose edicts are ignored by 
the county prefect, the police, and the employees of other state 
offices.
