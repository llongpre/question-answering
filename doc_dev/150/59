  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 28/1/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu remains open to the variants of forming the 
executive resulted from the dialogue among the political 
parties, said presidency spokesman Traian Chebeleu at a press 
conference on Friday [28 January]. It rests with the parties, 
the spokesman said, to carry out negotiations among themselves 
in order to find the best ways of forming a parliamentary 
majority or an eventual executive team. "If the outcome of the 
negotiations is a parliamentary coalition larger than the one 
supporting the current government, the president will salute 
that," said Chebeleu. 
  Government reshuffling is a prerogative of the prime 
minister 
and he may do it whenever he sees it as necessary, said the 
spokesman. 
  The next week visit to Bucharest by the two co-presidents of 
the peace conference on former Yugoslavia was appreciated by the 
presidency spokesman as the result of the interest constantly 
shown by Romania in supporting the settlement of the Yugoslav 
crisis. The role of the Geneva conference as well as of the 
neighbouring countries is to support the efforts made by the 
countries involved in the settling of the crisis as a viable 
solution can emerge only from within the former Yugoslavia, the 
spokesman said and further added: "We can only contribute to 
the creation of an external climate favourable to the dialogue." 
Romania, as a neighbour, is interested in the settlement of the 
problems in the zone as soon as possible, leaving out the use of 
force means. 
  The Partnership for Peace is, the spokesman said, an offer 
made by the NATO to the Eastern countries, an offer which we 
have saluted. Romania's linking to the Euro-Atlantic structures 
and the NATO is an important step toward a strengthened security 
for Romania. It is a success for the Romanian diplomacy as the 
Partnership for Peace matches our constant approaches with 
respect to the role of NATO in this part of Europe, namely, that 
of not making discriminations with regard to the security of the 
countries in the zone. This point of view has prevailed in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said the Romanian presidency 
spokesman. 
  Presidential spokesman, Ambassador Traian Chebeleu also 
referred his news conference on January 28 to President Ion 
Iliescu's visit in Timisoara and, before that, in Focsani, 
regarding a pointless protest by the county branch of the Alfa 
Trade Union Cartel, and, respectively, the president's contacts 
with private companies, as seen by an EXPRES MAGAZIN journalist. 
  The presidential spokesman recalled to the attending 
journalists the fact that "during almost all his visits in the 
country the president inquired about and visited private 
economic enterprises." Ambassador Chebeleu referred in that 
context to the Romanian head of state's meeting with Romanian 
businessmen on November 30, 1993, his attendance of the "1993 
Private Companies' Top" meeting, where he made an extensive 
address, as well as to the fact that on his trips abroad, when 
he was accompanied by businessmen, the Romanian president 
included every time also representatives of private Romanian 
firms.
