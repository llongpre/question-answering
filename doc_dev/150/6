<F P=106> [From the 16 March Romanian press review] </F>
  [Excerpt] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/3/1994 -- "Irredentist 
Fangs in Bucharest and in Transylvania" is the headline in daily 
ADEVARUL of the set of reports on the observance of the 
anniversary of the 1848 revolution by the ethnic Hungarian in 
Romania. The matter is covered by all newspapers that emphasize 
the attempt of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania 
[UDMR] Deputy Imre Borbely to make an address in Hungarian in 
Romania's Parliament. "To speak Hungarian before the Chamber of 
Deputies means an official offense to the country and to the 
fellow parliamentarians," writes daily CRONICA ROMANA, noting 
that "this characteristic rudeness of Mr. Borbely, a UDMR 
hardliner, (...) serves only those accused of nationalism (...) 
and we must admit that in such situations they are right, 
because one needs not be a nationalist to feel offended in one's 
own home, in one's own country, and in one's own parliament." 
  Daily ORA covers the visit paid to Transylvania by high 
state 
officials of Hungary in order to celebrate together with the 
Hungarian minority there the memory of the 1848 revolution. 
"The Hungarian Government's gesture to celebrate at high level 
the event that was a happy one for them and a tragical one for 
us, is impolite and this is an understatement (...). It is 
offending the Romanians' feelings" daily ORA writes. "The 
Hungarian revisionism is behaving as if the Hungarian empire 
existed, temporarily subjected to different, unjust laws, but 
still an empire, consequently the government has to participate 
in the festivities in its eternal provinces, irrespective of the 
present situation (...) The Hungarian revisionism tries in 
every possible way [to achieve] Romania's isolation from the 
community of European states. In an isolated Romania, subject 
to the quarantine of civilization, the difficult mission has 
been assumed by the UDMR. In Romania's Parliament there is a 
party hostile to Romania, that despises the Romanian nation."
