  [Text] Seoul, ROMPRES, 9/3/1994 -- Friendship and 
cooperation have been the traits of the bilateral relations 
between Romania and the Republic of Korea since the diplomatic 
relations were established, said Romanian President Ion Iliescu 
at his arrival on Wednesday, March 9, in Seoul where he started 
an official visit. 
  Romanian President Ion Iliescu reaffirmed Romania's decision 
to consolidate and deepen the cooperation relations with the 
Republic of Korea, underscoring the significance which he gave 
to the meeting with the Korean president, with other 
decision-makers of the Korean political and parliamentary life, 
stressing the interest in the dialogue with representatives of 
the Korean economic and business society. 
  The Romanian head of state expressed his confidence that the 
exchange of opinions with regard to the situation in the two 
countries as well as to the regional and international situation 
would be productive, leading to conclusions able to encourage a 
bilateral and multilateral cooperation as tight and profitable 
as possible. 
  The President of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-sam 
expressed 
his strong belief that the Romanian people would surpass all the 
difficulties, building the democracy and the market economy as 
grounds for the freedom and prosperity of the country. The 
Korean president noticed with satisfaction that the cooperation 
between the two countries had been developing, stressing that 
the presence in Seoul of the Romanian head of state would not 
only boost the friendship and collaboration relations but it 
would also have its merit in reducing the distance between the 
European East and the Asian Far-East.
