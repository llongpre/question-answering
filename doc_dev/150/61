  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 08, BNS -- The Lithuanian-Romanian 
political treaty indicates the significance of the first visit 
to Lithuania by a Romanian leader after the restoration of 
Lithuanian independence, Romanian President Ion Iliescu said at 
a press conference after the accord was signed in Vilnius 
Tuesday [8 March]. 
  The agreement on friendship and cooperation was signed by 
Iliescu and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
Agreements on investment protection and promotion, and 
commercial cooperation in 1994 were signed by Lithuanian 
Industry and Trade Minister Kazimieras Klimasauskas and Romanian 
Trade Minister Cristian Ionescu. 
  "The signing of the friendship and cooperation treaty with 
Romania expands Lithuania's relations with Black sea countries," 
the Lithuanian president said. 
  In his words, Lithuania uses every opportunity to improve 
its 
ties with both "next-door" and more distant neighbors. 
Lithuania and Romania should make use of their geographical 
location to strengthen economic and commercial relations, he 
said. 
  Iliescu said Romania welcomes every initiative that enhances 
security and stability. The Romanian leader said a positive 
thing is that security zones are created around both the Baltic 
and the Black sea, but it is "hard to speak" about a union of 
these zones. 
  Both presidents said their countries pay much attention to 
safeguarding security. Brazauskas pointed out that both 
countries signed up for NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
The Lithuanian president expressed hope that Russia will join 
the program in the near future. "The problem of creating blocs 
in Europe would then disappear," he said. 
  In Iliescu's words, Lithuania and Romania seek to join 
different European and international cooperation structures, and 
"this should not be hindered by any economic or political 
barriers." 
  Commenting on the commercial cooperation agreement, Minister 
Klimasauskas said it is very democratic, allowing to choose 
goods and to set prices without any restrictions. 
  The Romanian delegation completes its two-day visit to 
Lithuania Tuesday. Before departure, Iliescu will visit Vilnius 
University.
