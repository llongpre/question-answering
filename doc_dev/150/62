  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 25/1/1994 -- In an interview 
granted to the daily CRONICA ROMANA, President Ion Iliescu shows 
his opinions regarding the memorandum concluded between Romania 
and IMF and Romania's participation in the Partnership for Peace 
NATO programme. 
  "The memorandum is not a document imposed on the Romanian 
Government by the IMF. It reflects in fact the government's 
economic principles negotiated and approved by the IMF, for the 
principles in the memorandum are part of the Romanian 
Government's economic reform strategy. That is why I view as 
false the references regarding the fact that the IMF is 
dictating to us, that the memorandum could have had negative 
effects. In fact these are issues specific to the process of 
transition and economic reform in Romania, directly linked to 
the essence of the government's economic policy. The truth is 
that we are facing a difficult situation which implies also 
specific restrictive measures that we are to self-impose on us, 
precisely to relaunch and bring to normality the economic life 
in our country." 
  Related to Romania's participation in the NATO programme of 
Partnership for Peace, President Ion Iliescu stated the 
following: "the taken decision is a solution for which we have 
strived a lot. It was obvious that there were several efforts in 
the past years to impose a discriminatory treatment in the ties 
with the countries in this area... It seems to me that once with 
the American Administration's initiative that has carried into 
effect that partnership, the NATO leadership has answered 
Romania's fundamental concerns regarding non-discriminatory 
elements among the countries in this part of Europe. That is 
why the adopted solution seems to be the most correct one 
corresponding to the current period". 
  Ion Iliescu also showed criticism over certain positions 
expressed in Romania against the country's participation in the 
Partnership for Peace programme. "To follow this line would 
mean nothing else but to give satisfaction precisely to those 
who are seeking to isolate Romania and put our country at threat 
as regards its security and stability".
