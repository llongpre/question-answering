  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/3/1994 -- The Bucharest 
newspapers of 9 March comment on Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu's tour of countries in Europe and Asia. "The first stage 
of the new presidential tour" daily LIBERTATEA writes, "was 
Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, where, considering that Romania 
and Lithuania have had similar political evolution and 
principles, Presidents Ion Iliescu and Algirdas Brazauskas 
signed the first Treaty of Friendship and Collaboration between 
the two countries." The government daily VOCEA ROMANIEI 
emphasizes in a commentary entitled "The First Steps Toward 
Rewarding Cooperation" the Lithuanian head of state's assessment 
made during a dinner according to which "this visit has given 
new impetus to the Lithuanian-Romanian relations, materialized 
among other things in bilateral agreements, a political 
agreement included." Also, the Lithuanian head of state 
expressed the confidence that "it is about the first steps on 
the path of a cooperation rewarding for either party." In turn, 
President Iliescu noted that "the visit is a welcome opportunity 
to single out the traditions of the relations between our 
countries and peoples, the similarity of certain moments and 
stages in their remote history." 
  "What seems noteworthy to me," writes the CRONICA ROMANA 
special envoy, "is the moment at which Romania is signing the 
treaty with Lithuania, a country which has not regretted for a 
moment its disjoining from the CIS. The contacts between 
Romanian and Lithuanian businessmen proved promising for either 
party. A fine winter tale has been written in Vilnius, of two 
countries that are being united faster and more thoroughly than 
we could suspect, by their poverty and problems. And they, the 
Lithuanians, are close enough for the relations between the two 
countries to follow the growth confirmed through the treaty 
signed yesterday". 
  The DIMINEATA envoy in Vilnius opines in his dispatch that 
"the presence of Romania's president in the Lithuanian capital 
and especially the political Treaty of Friendship and 
Collaboration between the two states have meanings that cannot 
be missed by analysts. Above all, both states were among the 
first (Romania was the very first) to sign the Partnership for 
Peace with the NATO and that was not prompted by the wish to 
remake the 'sanitary belt' through which the west seemed to 
isolate the Soviet empire in the inter-bellum period, but in 
order to build a system of relations meant to secure their quiet 
which they need so much in order to build a market economy and a 
state of law, in the lastingness of which they are equally 
interested".
