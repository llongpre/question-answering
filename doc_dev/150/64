  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/3/1994 -- The visit of the 
Romanian premier, Nicolae Vacaroiu, in the counties of Mures, 
Harghita and Covasna is welcome, this being an opportunity for 
him to know first hand the problems of the inhabitants of these 
counties, Greater Romania Party's (PRM) leader Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor told the press at his weekly news conference. 
  Tudor said that in certain places in Transylvania leaflets 
printed in Hungary are reported to be circulating, threatening 
PRM leaders and the Hungarians who live in harmony with the 
Romanians. In his opinion, once the conflicts in former 
Yugoslavia are over, "international professionals" are trying to 
shift the testing arena to Romania. 
  PRM president voiced his satisfaction for the recent 
government reshuffle, which he termed as a response full of 
"responsibility" to the alarm signals given by his party. 
  Without assuming the "merit" for the replacement of the 
former Minister of Defence Nicolae Spiroiu, Tudor qualified his 
removal as "a consequence of his own mistakes," and the reaction 
of the "monarchist" opposition as a proof that Nicolae Spiroiu 
"was an important part in the political machinations" that wish 
the coming of former King Mihai the First to Romania.
