  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 12/5/1994 -- Starting today 
under the aegis of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe is the International Seminar on the Protection and 
Management of Fresh Water Sources in Eastern and Central Europe. 
  The opening session, presided by Francesco Parisi, chairman 
of the Committee for Environment, Regional Planning and Local 
Authorities of the Council of Europe, approached the general 
issues of the role the Danube basin can play in Europe, the 
global management of water in environmental policies. Held 
under the sign of European integration, the proceedings of the 
seminar, Mr. Parisi said, "are part of the building of a great 
edifice, because the nation we all belong to is the European 
nation." 
  In the address made on the occasion, Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu gave a brief description of Romania's experience in 
water management, of this country's water resources and its 
hydrographic map, of the need to use water economically, of the 
management and protection of water resources. 
  Adrian Nastase, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, welcomed 
the participants in the Bucharest seminar on behalf of the 
Romanian Parliament, reasserting Romania's wish to align to 
European standards as the major objective of the Romanian 
foreign policy. 
  The opening speeches were followed by debates on the first 
theme: the actions taken by the Council of Europe in the 
direction of fresh water resources management and protection, 
with a report by Victor Ruffy, vice-president of the Committee 
for Environment, Regional Planing and Local Authorities of the 
Council's Parliamentary Assembly.
