  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 10/6/1994 -- The weekly TINERAMA 
published in its Friday issue a facsimile of an engagement paper 
for cooperation with Securitate signed by Ladislau Tokes, better 
known by the public opinion under the name of Laszlo Tokes. 
  Bishop Tokes, who -- the weekly says -- had chosen by 
himself 
the cover name of Laszlo Kolozsvari, was committing himself: "To 
cooperate with the state security organs of the Interior 
Ministry in order to provide information concerning the 
concepts, behaviour and actions of the persons with whom I get 
in contact and which (information) have specific importance. At 
the same time, I will supply information regarding the behaviour 
and actions of other countries' citizens who are visiting the 
country and who, under that coverage, are operating activities 
hostile to our country." 
  TINERAMA journalist Ioan Itu who signs the article claims 
the 
document was made available to him a long time ago by a former 
securitate officer. The journalist motivates his silence until 
now: 
  "We kept discretion on this issue because of a very simple 
reason: We were aware of the existence of a receipt signed by 
Laszlo Tokes in October 1989 for the sum of 20,000 lei -- which 
he has never denied -- receipt given to an officer of the 
Hungarian Intelligence Service, so that, at least for us, it is 
not very clear the role he played then, nor the service whose 
orders he was following: the Romanian or the Hungarian."
