   Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci said she will stay
with friends in southern Florida and has no plans to work with her
Romanian coach or with the U.S. Gymnastics Federation.
   Officials of the federation had flown to New York in hopes of
contacting Comaneci and setting up a meeting between the former
Olympic champion and her former coach, Bela Karolyi, who defected
earlier and now lives in Houston.
   But Comaneci said Monday she would not be working with the
federation, adding forcefully, ``I have no business with my former
coach.''
   Comaneci, 28, left Romania a week ago, enduring a six-hour
nighttime trek over rough terrain to reach the Hungarian border.
She arrived in New York City on Friday and Monday flew to Miami.
   She left the plane on the arm of Constantin Panit, a fellow
Romanian exile who aided in her defection and lives with his wife,
Maria, in Hallandale.
   Panit said the two had been friends in Romania.
   Representatives from the State Department greeted the two at
Miami International Airport and quickly ushered them to a waiting
car.
   Some news reports had said Comaneci would go to Indianapolis,
where the federation is located, or Houston, where Karolyi lives.
But she said her immedate plans were to relax with Panit and his
family, who belong to a community of Romanian exiles in southern
Florida.
   ``I came here a few years ago and I liked it,'' Comaneci said.
   Comaneci arrived in New York City on Friday after fleeing
Romania through Hungary and Austria. She held a brief news
conference then, but since has stayed out of the public eye _
despite a brief shopping spree at Macy's, she said.
   Comaneci gained worldwide fame at age 14 when she became the
first gymnast ever to receive a perfect score of 10 in the
Olympics, an achievement she repeated seven times during the 1976
Games at Montreal.
