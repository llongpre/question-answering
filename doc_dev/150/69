  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- The 
Romanian-Israeli official talks on Thursday, April 21, between 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, consisted mainly of an analysis of the 
present bilateral relations. 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mircea Geoana 
said 
at the end of the talks that both parties had concentrated upon 
the economic issues and had analyzed some projects regarding the 
financing of some credit lines for industry and agriculture as 
well as the backing of the recently founded joint 
Romanian-Israeli Bank. The two parties agreed upon future 
negotiations of some credit lines at governmental level to be 
made available by Israel to Romania. In accordance with the 
governmental accord between the two countries, the two foreign 
ministers approached new possibilities of personnel training, 
including exchanges of journalists specialized in tourism issues. 
  The international life was another subject of the dialogue 
between the two foreign ministers. Romanian Foreign Minister 
Teodor Melescanu said that the Middle East was one of the "poles 
of interest" for Romania. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
informed that the chief of the Romanian diplomacy had asked 
support from Israel to Romania's seeking participation in the 
multilateral groups established in the peace process. In this 
respect, the Romanian party showed its interest in joining in 
the concrete projects in Gaza and Jericho. The two dignitaries 
approached also issues concerning the evolution of the conflict 
in Bosnia. 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said also that 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres had talked with his 
Romanian counterpart in an "amicable" manner about the occurance 
in Romania of "several isolated cases" of anti-Semitism. The 
Israeli chief-diplomat said that, in spite of the correct 
decisions and positions taken by the Romanian Government which 
had been well received in Israel, he had to ask, because of the 
sensible subject, the authorities in Bucharest to continue their 
actions in the same spirit. The Romanian chief diplomat said 
that such situations were "isolated" and explained that the 
phenomenon could be linked to the transition period as well as 
to the freedom of expression manifesting in Romania.
