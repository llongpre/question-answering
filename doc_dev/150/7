  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 29/1/1994 -- Teodor Melescanu, 
the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, was on an official 
visit to Morocco on 26-28 January in response to an invitation 
from his Moroccan counterpart. 
  Foreign Minister Melescanu had talks with A. Filali, 
minister 
of state and foreign minister of the Kingdom of Morocco about 
the present stage and the prospects of the Romanian-Moroccan 
relations, and about international and regional matters of joint 
interest. Minister Melescanu met with the president of Morocco's 
Chamber of Representatives, with the Moroccan ministers of 
mining and energy, public works, and cultural affairs. 
  The talks with the Moroccan personalities gave the two sides 
the opportunity to express their wish that partnership be the 
basic principle of the future development of their bilateral 
relations. To this effect the possibility was examined of taking 
actions apt to render the Romanian-Moroccan relations a 
privileged nature. 
  The exchange of opinions on international and regional 
issues 
revealed similitude or closeness in assessing the developments 
in the areas in which the two countries are located and on a 
wider international plane. 
  Concomitantly with the visit to Morocco of the Romanian 
minister of foreign affairs, the Romanian-Moroccan Joint 
Governmental Committee for Economic, Technical and Scientific 
Cooperation held its 8th session under the chairmanship of the 
two countries' foreign ministers. The committee agreed on 
cooperation projects in port facility development, drilling, 
energy, mining, agriculture, professional training. Both sides 
admitted that the trade exchanges had been below their economic 
potential and agreed to favor direct contacts between public and 
private businesses, between medium and small ventures. 
  At the end of the official visit to Morocco and of the 8th 
session of the joint committee, the Romanian and Moroccan 
foreign ministers signed several bilateral juridical documents: 
the convention for the mutual guaranteeing of investments, the 
statement on establishing regular consultations between the two 
foreign ministries, the programme of the cultural accord for the 
years 1994 and 1995.
