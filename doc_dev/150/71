  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 24/3/1994 -- Significant changes 
in the electorate's options are currently taking place in 
Romania, according to an opinion poll carried out by the 
Romanian Public Opinion Polling Institute [IRSOP], requested by 
the Romanian Foundation for Democracy, whose results are 
published exclusively by daily TINERETUL LIBER. 
  If presidential elections were to take place in Romania and 
the candidates to run for the presidency would be the same as in 
the 1992 election campaign, 37 percent would be likely to opt 
for Emil Constantinescu [1992 candidate of the opposition 
electoral alliance], 27 percent for [current Romanian President] 
Ion Iliescu, and 10 percent for Gheorghe Funar (National 
Romanian Unity Party -- PUNR.) Worth mentioning is that 20 
percent of those polled said that they would abstain from vote. 
  As for a potential call of parliamentary elections, 30 
percent of the electorate would favor the Democratic Convention 
of Romania (CDR -- opposition,) while 23 percent would vote for 
the ruling party, the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. 
  Some 35 percent of the polled people view that a government 
formed by the opposition would be much successful in getting the 
country out of the crisis, 31 percent consider that the crisis 
could be overcome by a coalition government formed by the 
current ruling party together with the CDR opposition group and 
the Democratic Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN], while 20 
percent are of the opinion that much suited would be a coalition 
government consisting of the PDSR with the PUNR, the Socialist 
Party of Labor [PSM], and the Greater Romania Party [PRM], which 
currently are the main government backers. Worth mentioning is 
that 14 percent of the polled people are of the opinion that a 
PDSR government would be most suited to get the country out of 
the crisis. 
  Among the politicians in the current parliamentary majority, 
in the event that Ion Iliescu would not run for the presidential 
elections, 39 percent of the electorate are likely to opt for 
Adrian Nastase, the current speaker of the Chamber of Deputies 
and executive chairman of the PDSR, 21 percent for Gheorghe 
Funar, current chairman of the PUNR, and 10 percent are favoring 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor, the current chairman of the PRM. 
  The poll was carried out over 1-7 March 1994 on 1,100 
individuals in 65 localities in the rural areas and in Romanian 
towns.
