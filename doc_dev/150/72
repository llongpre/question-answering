President Ion Iliescu received Wednesday, March 16, Ukraine's 
Minister Of Defense Vitaliy Radeskyy, currently in Romania at 
the invitation of his Romanian counterpart Gheorghe Tinca. The 
guest saluted the Romanian head of state on behalf of Ukraine's 
President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  The good relations between the Ministries of Defense of the 
two countries were pointed together with the wish of both 
Romania and Ukraine to further them. The parties referred to 
the agreement that was going to be signed on March 17 by the 
ministers of defense of the two countries. 
  An examination of the stage of the relations between Romania 
and Ukraine pointed to ways and the common wish to develop them 
further, to the interest of the two peoples. 
  Ukraine's Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radeskyy also had on 
Wednesday, 16 March, a meeting with the chief of the Romanian 
diplomacy, Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who seized the 
opportunity to stress the importance Romania attaches to its 
relations with the Ukraine. 
  The sides pointed out the contribution the two countries 
could bring to enhancing security and stability in this part of 
Europe, which is confronted with special historical issues and 
momentary hardships. The sides underlined that, besides the 
Euro-Atlantic integration as prime objective, the creation of a 
favorable regional climate was an important complementary factor 
in the process. 
  In a different line of ideas, aspects of the partnership for 
peace were discussed, as well as the Ukraine's participation in 
the peace-keeping forces deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
