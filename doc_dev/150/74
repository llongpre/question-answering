  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 28/2/1993 -- Malta's President 
Censu Tabone ended his visit in Romania on Monday [28 February] 
noon with an official ceremony to his departure. After a last 
round of talks, attended also by the members of the delegations, 
the two presidents made short statements to the press. 
  Romanian President Ion Iliescu underlined the political 
significance of the visit -- the first at that level since the 
December revolution in Romania and Mr. Censu Tabone's first 
visit in Romania -- and the favourable political climate of the 
relations between Romania and Malta. "President Censu Tabone's 
presence in Romania represents an expression of the political 
willingness to consolidate the bilateral relations and the 
collaboration within international bodies," said the Romanian 
head of state. Both parties have agreed to intensify the 
cooperation in the fields of shipment, telecommunications, 
services, tourism, science and culture. The Romanian Foreign 
Ministry will draw up a draft treaty of friendship between the 
two countries to be signed, if possible, within the current 
year, President Iliescu said. 
  In his turn, the Maltese head of state said that during the 
three days of his visit in Romania he learned of Romania as of a 
country experiencing a development process, a people who 
regained the democratic beliefs and who affirmed an European 
vocation, who is boldly integrating within the European 
structures. President Tabone expressed hope that the 
preparation of the friendship treaty would not last too long as 
its finalisation within the current year would enable President 
Iliescu to make a visit in the Republic of Malta. President 
Tabone said he would ask the Maltese Parliament and Government 
to invite the Romanian president for a visit in Malta. 
  The Maltese president's visit in Romania included interviews 
with the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase, and 
with the Senate's vice-president Ioan Doru Taracila (the Senate 
president was making a visit in Japan at the time). An 
invitation was made that a Romanian parliamentary delegation 
make a visit in the Republic of Malta. During his stay, 
President Tabone visited also Sinaia mountain resort and the 
Brasov County, central Romania.
