  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 28/3/1994 -- In an interview with 
a press correspondent of the Macedonian news agency of 
THESSALONIKI, President Ion Iliescu of Romania said his visit to 
Greece over 30-31 March "has a special political significance, 
both for the bilateral relations and for the general development 
in the Balkans." 
  "The Romanian-Greek relations, which I can term as 
excellent," the president of Romania said, "are based on long 
and solid traditions. Along history many have been the 
circumstances in which our countries helped each other in 
friendship and solidarity. Maybe the inter-war period was the 
most flourishing, when Romania and Greece were the promoters of 
development and cooperation in the Balkans. 
  "After the 1989 revolution in Romania, the relations between 
Romania and Greece have followed an ascending curve in all 
spheres, building an atmosphere of mutual confidence which we 
intend to capitalise during this visit. We shall avail 
ourselves of this opportunity not only to enhance the relations 
of friendship and cooperation between our countries, but also to 
find new practical ways of developing the political 
consultations, economic collaboration, cultural and human 
contacts between our peoples. We have always appreciated the 
assistance Greece has rendered to us, the attachment to our 
demarches for integration in the European Union and for gaining 
full membership to the Council of Europe. The Greek Parliament 
was the first to ratify the treaty for Romania's association 
with the European Union. It was also Greece that upheld the 
idea of non-differential treatment by NATO of the countries in 
the Centre and East of Europe and we believe that Greece can 
have a new and important contribution in all the phases of 
Romania's integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures. 
  "At the talks we are going to have in Athens we shall 
doubtlessly approach the aspects concerning the complex 
situation in our region. By dialogue and exchange of ideas we 
hope to bring our contribution to finding the best solutions apt 
to strengthen stability and peace in this part of Europe," 
President Ion Iliescu said.
