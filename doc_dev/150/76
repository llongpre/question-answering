  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/6/1994 -- The third plenary 
session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation Zone opened on Tuesday, 21 June, morning in 
Bucharest with a ceremony attended by Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu. 
  In his address President Iliescu said that just three years 
after launching, the Black Sea economic cooperation was on a 
developing way to become a genuine subregional organization. 
  "Promoting actively the principles of the Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] and of the United 
Nations Charter, it is contributing to the creation of new 
opportunities for integration in the Euro-Atlantic space. I 
hope that the meeting in Bucharest will represent an important 
step in finding and employing the community of interests favored 
by the vicinity of the Black Sea," said the Romanian president. 
  President Iliescu expressed his confidence that once the 
problems generated by the transition in the new states of the 
zone are surpassed, and the problems caused by the lack of 
infrastructure, institutions, and managers at micro-economic 
level are solved, then the economic cooperation of the Black Sea 
would manage to succeed in building a "unity in diversity" as a 
basis for future economic projects able to bring a contribution 
to the political and economic stability in the area, and to 
ensure a climate of peace and understanding. 
  "This is, ultimately, our common interest in whose 
realization we have not only the right, but also the duty to 
engage ourselves with all our forces, with all the intellectual 
ability of each of our countries," said President Iliescu. 
  The Romanian head of state said that in the achievement of 
this goal an important role is to be plaid by diplomacy, which 
gains multiple dimensions, including an important, necessary, 
and useful parliamentary component. 
  The fact that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation Zone has succeeded in such a short period 
of time in creating its own structures within the economic zone 
represents a contribution to the promotion of a climate of 
trust, favorable to cooperation, and to the stimulation of the 
governments in proving flexibility and realism, said the 
Romanian president. 
  "In spite of the cultural and economic diversity, which 
sometimes bars collaboration, the Black Sea states have solely 
the chance of cooperation, are destined, in a positive manner, 
of course, to develop tight cooperation. At the same time, 
Europe cannot be conceived without this area, the west European 
countries cannot ignore this region of big economic interest, 
which is representing at the same time a very important 
potential of collaboration in all fields and a bridge to other 
geographic zones of high interest," said President Ion Iliescu. 
  "Romania has supported from the very beginning and in the 
most active manner the cooperation idea between the countries 
situated on the shores of the Black Sea and continues to assign 
to it increased importance as a connecting factor in the 
promotion of the general European cooperation, in extending the 
North-South cooperation, the cooperation between the Western 
world and the Middle East and, last but not least, between 
Europe and Asia," said President Iliescu. 
  "I hope that the current meeting will represent, along with 
a 
valuable contribution to the consolidation of the parliamentary 
component of the economic cooperation of the Black Sea, also an 
important step in the promotion of a climate of understanding 
and tolerance, in the achievement of a strengthened regional 
stability, in preventing the conflict situations, for the 
development of the region, and, last but not least, for closer 
relations among our countries," said Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu.
