  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/1/1994 -- President Ion 
Iliescu stressed in an interview with the government daily VOCEA 
ROMANIEI the necessity of continuing the dialogue with the 
representatives of the political parties as well as of talks to 
be started among parties, between parties and trade unions, and 
between the government and the trade unions, so as to single out 
a platform of national interest, a program for Romania's 
development for the beginning of the 21st century. 
  The president termed his meetings with political leaders as 
"a first touch (...) that will have to be furthered. Likewise, 
the direct inter-party dialogue should continue. Which is what 
I have suggested. And so said also the representatives of the 
Democratic Convention of Romania" (the group of opposition 
parties.) 
  "To the extent to which a political pact or at least an 
understanding among parties will or will not come to the fore," 
President Iliescu went on, "it seems to me that the next step to 
be taken is to extend the dialogue at a parties--trade unions 
and government-trade unions level. I have been always ready for 
direct talks with the representatives of the big trade union 
federations, in order to secure a framework of partnership for 
the dialogue among these political forces, trade unions, 
government, administration, and employers." 
  Of the major targets of the envisaged wide-scale dialogue, 
Ion Iliescu mentioned the establishment of the contact points 
for the establishment of a platform of national interest and the 
sketching of a perspective program, of a social-economic 
development strategy for Romania with the beginning of the 21st 
century in sight. "We have to look ahead, so as to open the 
prospect for Romania's integration in the processes 
characteristic of the world economic development," President Ion 
Iliescu stressed. "Or, here, I think, all forces, political 
included, should be interested. And all our valuable people -- 
and we do have such people -- should be attracted to this work 
of national interest."
