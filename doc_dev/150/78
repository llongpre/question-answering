  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/4/1994 -- Romania's national 
defense doctrine and the training of the Romanian peace-keeping 
unit were among the issues approached at the Romanian Defense 
Ministry's first weekly press conference, on Friday [8 April] in 
Bucharest. 
  Romania's national defense doctrine is based on the 
principle 
of defense sufficiency during peace-time, said the defense 
ministry spokeswoman, Major Elena Olariu, who is the first woman 
to hold that office in the history of the Romanian Armed Forces. 
The doctrine provides that Romania will never attack another 
state. For the situations when Romania could be the target of 
an aggression, the doctrine provides for reactions based on the 
principle of omnidirectional defense. The defense doctrine is 
going to be discussed on Monday [11 April] by Romania's Supreme 
Defense Council, together with all the other documents 
concerning the whole concept of national security. 
  The Romanian peace-keeping unit, established on 15 July 
1993, 
is now in an advanced stage of preparations, a fact appreciated 
also by General George Joulwan, the supreme commander of the 
Allied Forces in Europe. The unit comprises one staff company, 
three infantry companies, one millimeters-caliber thrower 
battery, one anti-tank artillery battery, one mixed 
anti-aircraft artillery battery, and a logistics sub-unit. 
  Romania is currently contributing to the U.N. missions with 
the following military: Six watchers in Iraq-Kuwait, six 
watchers in Rwanda ("no bad news about them at the time being," 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu said on Friday after 
his meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes,) and 136 
people with the Romanian military hospital in Somalia (where the 
tide of patients is rising and stronger security measures have 
been taken after the departure of the U.S., German, and Italian 
troops.) 
  The defense ministry spokeswoman said also that the ministry 
had nine officers sent for studies in the U.S.A., six in the 
United Kingdom, six in France, and five in Germany.
