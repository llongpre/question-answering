  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Marian Munteanu, 
head of the Movement for Romania [MPR], presented to a news 
conference on 31 May a document, dated 20 December 1993, issued 
by the Association for the Redemption of the Rights and 
Properties of the Jews of Romanian Extraction. 
  According to Marian Munteanu, the document had been advanced 
to the government and Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu. He claimed that 
meetings had taken place on the issue of Holocaust in Romania. 
In the presented document, the Association demands from the 
Romanian state the restitution of the material assets possessed 
by the former Romanian citizens of Jewish origin and assumption 
by the Romanian state of responsibility for the killing of 
400,000 Jews during the Second World War, by the "Romanian 
fascist" regime. 
  Marian Munteanu thinks the claims are not justified, since 
"there was no fascist state and no Holocaust in Romania" and the 
figure of 400,000 is "a simple mistake caused by insufficient 
knowledge of historic reality." The Movement for Romania, a 
non-parliamentary party, considers that the victims of 
repression and violence in Romania were Romanians and by no 
means the national minorities. A commitment by the state's 
current rulers to what the Jewish organizations claim might lead 
to Romania's economic enslaving, forcing the Romanian people to 
pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and retrocession of 
real estate and enterprises, Marian Munteanu said. He hoped 
Romania's president would deny the claims of the Association for 
Redemption of the Rights and Properties of the Jews of Romanian 
Extraction.
