  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- A regional center 
for air traffic control was inaugurated in Arad, western 
Romania, as the first in a set of five such up-to-date centers 
designed to ensure coverage for the entire national territory. 
The inauguration ceremony was attended along with the Romanian 
authorities by representatives of the Eurocontrol, the body 
concerned in air traffic control in Europe which assisted 
Romania in building the center. 
  The Arad center equipment employs the latest technologies. 
The center is endowed with an over-fly radar and other 
automatic equipments enabling the pilot to locate any time the 
position of the center and to know the flight-angle of his 
plane. The center is furnished also with a computer system 
securing a swift information coordination. 
  Beside the Arad center, other four similar centers for air 
traffic control are being built in Bucharest, Cluj, Bacau and 
Constanta. The Arad center has been recently visited by a NATO 
delegation that showed interest in the cooperation relations 
between the civilian and the military flights monitoring. The 
NATO delegation said that the development and upgrading of the 
traffic control of the civilian and military flights would 
speed-up Romania's integration in the European and Euro-Atlantic 
structures.
