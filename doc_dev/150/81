  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- A Romanian-Armenian 
consular convention was signed on Wednesday, 20 April, in 
Bucharest by the two countries' foreign ministers, Teodor 
Melescanu and Vahan Papazyan. 
  The signing of the convention was, according to the two 
foreign ministers, "a step ahead" in a long process. "The visit 
paid by the Armenian foreign minister is a clear sign of the two 
governments' wish to expand closer ties," Teodor Melescanu said. 
  The formal talks between the two foreign ministers concluded 
on Wednesday, 20 April. According to the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry's spokesman Mircea Geoana, the Romanian and Armenian 
foreign ministers approached during their interview issues 
related to bilateral and economic ties. Also stressed was the 
decision to speed up the process of concluding a basic political 
treaty that would be signed by the presidents of the two states 
by next fall.
