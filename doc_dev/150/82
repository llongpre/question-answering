  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- "The policy of 
getting closer to NATO, Romania's adherence to the Partnership 
for Peace, to the Western European Union [WEU], the steps we are 
making towards full integration within Euro-Atlantic structures 
are all representing a political option of the Romanian state," 
Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca told the government's daily 
VOCEA ROMANIEI. 
  "Romania is taking part in several UN programs for 
international assistance in areas of conflict," the Romanian 
minister added, reminding that participation of the Romanian 
Army with a field hospital and a subunit to fight radioactive 
contamination during the Gulf war. 
  "Moreover, the Partnership for Peace implies a series of 
concrete offers from us in the field of infantry, artillery, 
navy, and education, that is, those facilities put at the 
disposal for joint action with other NATO partners. For 
Romania, to ensure its security in an unstable area means the 
possibility and compulsory condition to consolidate its market 
economy, to expand commercial exchanges and constructive 
diplomacy apt to ensure the Romanian people a European standard 
of living, without threats of war, without embargoes that are so 
damaging and enjoying full freedom of a democratic political 
life. Democracy must not be only conquered, but also defended," 
the defense minister said.
