  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 3/5/1994 -- "We believe that 
some positive results have been obtained and Romania's relation 
with Germany is on the right track," said Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker Adrian Nastase at a press conference on Tuesday, 3 May, 
while assessing the results of a five-day visit in Germany made 
by a Romanian parliamentary delegation. 
  The members of the Romanian delegation consider they 
delivered to the German party a clear message stressing the 
interests Germany could have in this zone. In reply, the German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his next visit abroad would 
be in Romania. According to the delegation members, the German 
minister said Germany did not make discriminations between 
Romanian and the member countries of the Visegrad Group. 
  The members of the Romanian parliamentary delegation opined 
that Romania's relations with Germany must develop not only at 
federal level but also at the level of the lander, especially 
the Eastern ones.
