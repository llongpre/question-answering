  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/01/1994 -- Petre Roman, the 
president of the Democratic Party (PD) and head of the 
Commission for Defense, Public Order and National Security of 
the Romanian Chamber of Deputies (lower house of the 
parliament), said on Tuesday [11 January] in a statement that 
the NATO summit in Brussels did not bring any surprise as the 
American proposal of Partnership for Peace was adopted. 
  This result can be considered as disappointing for all the 
former members of the Warsaw Treaty including Romania, said 
Petre Roman. In the present context of the European security, 
Romania considers itself entitled to a larger and more assuring 
status with regard to its national security. 
  Petre Roman said the Partnership for Peace represented a 
compromise between two recent tendencies in Europe: On one 
side, the direct and strong request for NATO membership by the 
former socialist countries as they do not feel safe because of 
the revival of imperialist tendencies in Russia where the 
democratic process is far from being a firmly established 
reality and, on the other side, the very insistent, even tough 
request of Russia that NATO extending should not take place. 
  In front of the revival of certain hegemonic tendencies, of 
certain strategies of spheres of influence, Romania cannot feel 
secure as long as it has not found its natural place in the 
Western world which means its NATO membership, PD leader Petre 
Roman said. 
  Petre Roman appreciated as very important the fact that the 
United States had warned that if militarist and expansionist 
tendencies continued in Russia, the NATO would proceed to its 
enlargement toward the countries in the Central and Eastern 
Europe, including Romania.
