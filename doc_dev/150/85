  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/4/1994 -- Several leaders of 
the opposition parties making up the Democratic Convention of 
Romania [CDR] expressed at a press conference on Saturday, 9 
April, their decision to use all possibilities offered by the 
present political situation in order to prevent early elections. 
  Ion Diaconescu (National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party 
-- PNTCD), Dinu Patriciu (Liberal Party '93 -- PL '93), Attila 
Verestoy (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania -- UDMR), 
and Nicolae Taran (Civic Alliance Party -- PAC) maintained that 
the time for theoretical discussions had passed and that 
concrete solutions were necessary. They claimed the opposition 
had these solutions to offer. 
  Dinu Patriciu said that the dialogue with the ruling party 
[Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR] could resume only if 
the Vacaroiu cabinet resigned. The representatives of the CDR 
member parties concluded that they could resume the dialogue 
with the ruling party if PDSR understood "it is not the 
country's master but its servant." 
  CDR leader Emil Constantinescu presented to the press 
conference a "Manifesto for Romania's Salvation," whereby the 
CDR suggests several measures termed as "simple and efficient," 
meant to boost Romania's recovery from the crisis caused by "a 
incompetent and corrupt" government. 
  Considering themselves rightful to fight by any legal and 
democratic means for the nation's rescue, the CDR member parties 
call for: A "tough and fair" justice able to stop corruption; 
the allotment to the local administration of at least 18 percent 
of the taxes paid by the population; the cancellation of the 
farm taxes and the finalization of the process of granting the 
property title deeds; jobs to be created through investments and 
privatization; social protection for the youth, unemployed, and 
underprivileged; increased budgetary funds allotted to 
education, health, and culture; the Armed Forces' endowment to 
strengthen the defense capacity; and integration within the 
Euro-Atlantic structures and a stop to the slide toward other 
spheres of influence.
