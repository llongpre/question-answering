  [Text] Seoul, ROMPRES, 9/3/1994 -- The first day of the 
state visit to Seoul of the head of the Romanian state was 
devoted mainly to the talks with the president of the host 
country Kim Yong-sam. This is the first political-diplomatic 
contact at the highest level after the establishment in March 
1990 of diplomatic relations, and it comes as a natural 
consequence of the positive course of the bilateral relations. 
  The Romanian authorities have defined the main purpose of 
the 
visit as being that of giving the political signal for the 
development of the bilateral relations on all planes, of giving 
green light to major initiatives in the economic and commercial 
spheres. Another aim is that of intensifying the dialogue 
between the government and parliamentarian factors, 
representatives of political parties, between cultural, 
technical, scientific fora, and ngo's. 
  Romania is interested in a closer cooperation with the 
Republic of Korea in a number of sectors like 
telecommunications, car manufacturing, shipbuilding, metallurgy, 
food industry. There are hopes for a growth of Korean capital 
investment in Romania through such important companies like 
Daewoo, Samsung, Gold Star, Hyundai. 
  Romania is interested to learn from the experience the 
Republic of Korea earned in its own process of economic reform. 
  During the talks, the two heads of state agreed to sign a 
joint declaration that sums up the key points of the 
political-diplomatic event marked by the state visit to Seoul of 
the president of Romania. The declaration shows that this 
summit meeting, held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere, 
enabled the two presidents to have a sincere and useful exchange 
of opinions about the international situation, including the 
situation in the north-east of Asia and the Korean peninsula, as 
well as that in the Balkans, and to examine the ways of 
extending the relations between the two countries. 
  While Presidents Ion Iliescu and Kim Yong-sam, accompanied 
by 
the members of their official delegations, proceeded to 
expressing their points of view on the relations between their 
countries and the present international evolutions, a number of 
parallel meetings between Romanian officials and their Korean 
counterparts were in progress. 
  This evening, an official dinner will be given at the 
presidential palace in honor of the president of Romania.
