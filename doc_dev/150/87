  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 14/1/1994 -- Referring to the 
news item released by AFP and published by Turkish dailies 
regarding a statement by Albert Chernyshev, Russian ambassador 
to Turkey, who accuses Romania of sucking in, without 
authorization, a part of the Russian natural gas meant for 
Turkey, the Romanian Ministry of Industries issued the following 
press release to the ROMPRES national agency: 
  "Romania's taking in a part of the Russian natural gas meant 
for Turkey is a technical impossibility. The natural gas supply 
from the Russian Federation to the Balkan countries, i.e. 
Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey runs through separate pipelines. 
The pipelines for Turkey and Bulgaria are connected to the 
pumping station at Orlovska, on Ukraine's territory. There is 
no outlet or other possibility to draw gas from these pipelines 
all along their length that traverses Romania. 
  "The pipeline that supplies Romania has the junction in 
Ukraine, upstream the Orlovska compressing station, i.e. on that 
station's intake. 
  "Besides, a representative of Gazprom -- the Russian natural 
gas exporter -- is permanently monitoring the gas amounts 
supplied to the three countries at the Isaccea station where the 
pipelines enter Romania's territory."
