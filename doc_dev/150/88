  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 16/2/1994 -- Franjo Tudjman, 
president of the Republic of Croatia, flew from Romania 
Wednesday, February 16, after a three-day official visit made at 
the invitation of Romanian President Ion Iliescu. The 
delegation Tudjman was head of was seen at the Otopeni Airport 
by a honor mission led by Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor 
Melescanu. 
  The head of the Romanian diplomacy said that "to his mind, 
the visit was an extremely important moment in the relations 
between the two countries, an opportunity to show Romania's 
preoccupation to transfer the good relations it had with former 
Yugoslavia to all the republics created following the breaking 
of Yugoslavia. We are very satisfied with the discussions 
conducted here, we signed the first treaty with a country from 
former Yugoslavia and the exchange of views we had on the 
prospects of finding a solution to the crisis in Yugoslavia has 
been very interesting for us. We are very satisfied and we hope 
that will be a moment marking a speeding up of our ties with 
Croatia and with all the republics of former Yugoslavia."
