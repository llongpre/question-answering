  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/2/1994 -- Mircea Ionescu 
Quintus, president of the National Liberal Party (PNL) announced 
a new round of negotiations for Thursday, 17 February, aiming at 
the unification of the liberal movement, an initiative involving 
the leadership of PNL, the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), and the 
fraction of the National Liberal Party that adhered to the 
Democratic Convention (PNL-CD.) The Liberal Party-93 (PL-93) is 
also to be represented at the talks by a group favorable to 
unification. 
  Asked to explain the situation created in PNL after the 
so-called "anti-ordinary" congress called by supporters of 
former PNL leader Radu Campeanu, both the present PNL President 
Ionescu-Quintus and PNL Vice President Viorel Catarama said the 
only chance for that grouping was to register as a new party, 
and said that Mr. Campeanu's supporters "brought grave prejudice 
to the liberal movement and to the opposition as a whole," and 
that the new leadership intended "no purge" in the party. 
  "The National Liberal Party, one of the main engineers of 
the 
great union of 1918, has taken note with disappointment and 
apprehension of the irresponsible and strongly anti-Romanian 
statements of President Mircea Snegur of Moldova," a PNL 
statement read by its president at the same news conference 
runs. "PNL hopes that the true Romanians in the Republic of 
Moldova will be able to defend their national being and 
independence from these new attempts of turning Bessarabia into 
a Russian colony," the statement winds up.
