  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 11/5/1994 -- Referring to the 
first round of the elections recently held in Hungary, the 
spokesman for the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mircea 
Geoana told a press conference on 11 May that "in order to have 
a complete and definitive picture of the Hungarian Parliament's 
composition, and, consequently, of the government to be 
appointed, we need to see the results of the second round. It 
is obvious however that the Socialist Party is heading for 
victory." 
  About the Romanian-Hungarian relations once socialists 
accede 
to power, the Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the 
socialists' statements in the pre-election period were already 
known. "They voiced a constructive approach the Socialist Party 
intended to have if, elections over, they gained access to the 
ruling structures," Mircea Geoana said. He also said that the 
Romanian side received such statements with interest and that 
"the Romanian authorities are waiting to see the outcome of the 
electoral process in Hungary, with a view to identifying, 
jointly with the new Hungarian Government, the concrete means to 
continue the negotiations on the framework political treaty, and 
on the bilateral relations as a whole." 
  According to information furnished by the spokesman for the 
Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mircea Geoana, the 
president of the European Parliament, Egon Klepsch is expected 
on an official visit to Romania on 16-17 May this year at the 
invitation of the Romanian Parliament. The head of the European 
Parliament will have meetings with the speakers of the two 
houses of the Romanian Parliament, with members of the Foreign 
Policy Committees, and with the Romanian parliamentary 
delegation to the European Parliament. He will also meet with 
leaders of the parliamentary groups, the chairman of the Council 
for Economic Coordination, Strategy and Reform, and the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs. Egon Klepsch will deliver a speech before a 
joint sitting of parliament, and will be received by the 
president of Romania. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman also informed the press that 
the president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, will 
be the guest of Romania on 2-4 June, at the invitation of Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  In the same line, the spokesman announced that the European 
Parliament approved in its plenary meeting the recommendation of 
the European Commission for a ECU 125,000,000 credit to Romania, 
representing the quota underwritten by the European Union from 
the $300,000,000 loan officially applied for by the Romanian 
Government to the G-24 with the purpose of compensating the 
balance of payments and financing the economic reform over 
1993-1994.
