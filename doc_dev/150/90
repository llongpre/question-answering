  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 29/4/1994 -- "Romania's 
security and defense in the context of its integration within 
European and Euro-Atlantic bodies with a tradition in the field 
of security" is the theme of a scientific seminar organized over 
27-29 April by the National Defense Collegium. 
  The seminar sets itself through the approached issues to 
debate Romania's position in Central and Eastern Europe within 
the framework of European security, the defense strategy in the 
context of Romania's European and Euro-Atlantic integration, 
potential implications due to the Russian Federation's adherence 
to the European security system. 
  The 29 April proceedings of the seminar will be attended by 
Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, by deputies and other
