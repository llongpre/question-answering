  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 24/4/1994 -- The works of the 
Crans Montana Forum conference with "The Emerging Markets" as 
the general theme ended on Sunday, April 24, at noon, in 
Bucharest at the Romanian Parliament Palace. 
  The closing session was attended and addressed by Romanian 
President Ion Iliescu, by the president of the Forum Foundation 
Jean Paul Carteron as well as by Bernard de Montferrand, special 
envoy of the French prime minister. 
  The four-day conference has gathered in plenary or topical 
sessions about 1,800 delegates from all over the world. It was 
an occasion for useful exchanges of opinions with regard to 
current political and economic issues as well as for many 
business contacts. 
  In his address, Crans Montana Forum President Jean Paul 
Carteron expressed his respect and admiration for the Romanian 
organisers of the conference and underscored the "resounding 
success" of the conference which, in his opinion, enabled the 
approaching of several stringent issues of the current economic 
and political international life. The Forum Foundation 
president added that the conference gave also the image of 
Romania as of a country with large possibilities and at the same 
time with a significant role in the international life. The 
hands shaking by 'Arafat, Peres and Iliescu represented 
Romania's come back on the world politics scene, said Carteron. 
If Romania needs the world, now it is clear that the world, 
too, needs Romania, said Jean Paul Carteron. 
  In his address, the envoy of the French prime minister 
Bernard de Montferrand conveyed a proposal by Premier Edouard 
Balladur calling for the achievement of a pact of stability in 
Europe expressing the European countries' willingness to observe 
and promote the values of civilization and the principles of 
freedom which were born on this continent. 
  In his turn, Romanian President Ion Iliescu said that the 
Forum meeting in Bucharest had been a genuine forum of ideas, 
debates, contacts among a large number of politicians and 
personalities of the economic life from all over the world. The 
meeting was a unique experience through the possibility created 
for a large number of political and economic decision-makers to 
have useful exchanges of ideas along the four days of the 
conference, to have contacts and to establish immediate or 
future actions aiming to solve several problems confronting the 
international community, to establish new advantageous 
collaborations, said President Ion Iliescu. Through this 
conference, Bucharest has joined in the system of organising 
international meetings and the decision of establishing here of 
an international conference center confirms this course, said 
President Iliescu.
