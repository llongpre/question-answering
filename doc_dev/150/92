  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu offered an official dinner on Monday, 30 May, 
evening in honor of Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, who 
is paying a state visit to Romania. 
  In his toast, the Romanian president said that the talks he 
had the pleasure to have with the Indian head of state had 
permitted an examination of the basic aspects of the bilateral 
relations and especially the recognition of the main directions 
and ways of developing and deepening the Romanian-Indian 
collaboration in all fields of mutual interest. 
  President Iliescu expressed his confidence that the 
concluded 
agreements, synthetically expressed by the Declaration on 
Principles and Directions of Cooperation and by other documents 
that were going to be signed, would open a new chapter of the 
bilateral relations. 
  The Romanian president said that Romania was attaching a 
particular importance to the achievement of substantial 
progresses in the field of the commercial exchanges and economic 
cooperation. 
  The Romanian Government expresses its readiness to establish 
the inter-governmental juridical frame able to encourage actions 
of mutual interest between Romanian and Indian companies, said 
President Iliescu. 
  The Romanian president expressed his hope that the meetings 
between the businessmen who were accompanying the Indian 
president and Romanian businessmen would lead to results 
encouraging for both parties. 
  The exchange of views which we had, said President Iliescu, 
evinced the common preoccupations of the governments of Romania 
and India to promote understanding, collaboration, and peace in 
the world, and the common attachment to the universal values of 
the democracy. 
  In the field of external relations, Romania is engaged in 
the 
process of integration within the economic, political, and 
strategic European structures, and it develops cooperation 
relations with the countries with democratic traditions and with 
all its neighbors, said President Iliescu. 
  At the same time, within the strategy of its foreign policy, 
Romania grants special importance to the development of the 
traditional relations with the countries in the Asian-Pacific 
zone, one of the regions with the highest economic growth and 
healthy prospects for continued development in the coming 
decades, India holding a front-line place in that respect, said 
President Iliescu. 
  In his toast, Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma said 
that 
in the latest years there have been active contacts at various 
levels between Romania and India. 
  While the mutual visits by parliamentary delegations 
revealed 
the mutually shared political beliefs, the agreements signed in 
the fields of trade, science, and technology are an expression 
of the common decision to substantiate the bilateral relations, 
said the Indian president. 
  The economic restructuring taking place in India and the 
reform program launched in Romania create considerable 
possibilities for cooperation to mutual benefit, said the Indian 
head of state. 
  The prominent businessmen -- members of the Indian 
delegation 
accompanying the Indian president -- are expressing India's 
decision to diversify, increase, and stimulate economic 
cooperation with Romania, said the Indian president. 
  President Shankar Dayal Sharma expressed confidence that 
Romanian-Indian relations would gain substance and diversify. 
The Indian Government wishes to cooperate with the Romanian 
Government in order to carry out some common objectives, said 
the president. 
  The last decade of the century is offering chances, but also 
responsibilities. The magnitude of the problems confronting 
mankind shows that there is no country that can afford to live 
in isolation. Peace and prosperity are really indivisible in 
this world, in which we all live. India, as well as Romania 
have committed themselves in promoting the cause of peace and in 
building a fair, safe, and prosperous international order. I am 
convinced that our concerted actions will bring a significant 
contribution to this cause, to the mutual benefit of our 
countries, to the benefit of the entire humanity, said the 
Indian president.
