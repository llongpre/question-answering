  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 22/4/1994 -- In the speech made 
after the Friday plenum session of the Crans Montana Forum, at 
the workshop devoted to Romania, its economic potential and 
development perspectives, Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu expressed his 
conviction that the Bucharest conference would contribute to 
understanding the evolutions, the options for the present and 
future, the efforts Romania is making in promoting the 
democratic principles on the one hand and in consolidating the 
market mechanisms on the other. 
  The Romanian prime minister expressed the view that in the 
political and economic context of a South-Eastern Europe in full 
integration in the European structures and opening to the 
world's economic circuits, Romania is holding the privileged 
place secured to it by its strategic position and its resources. 
Romania is offering foreign investors a domestic market in full 
development, a ready access to neighboring foreign markets, an 
incentive juridical background permanently improved, a labor 
force capable of complex workmanship. 
  The prime minister of Romania showed that with effect from 
November 1992, the Romanian Government practically made 
effective its ruling programme and the strategy for social and 
economic reform covering the time interval up to 1996, and that 
sectorial surveys plead for continuing the reform in close 
correlation with the real situation of the Romanian economy, and 
with the technological, material, financial, currency and social 
constraints. 
  Premier Vacaroiu stressed that, although carried under the 
impact of negative factors accumulated in the years previous to 
1989 and in extremely unfavorable international conditions, the 
reforms went on in several planes: the reform of prices, the 
introduction of the value-added tax, the enhancement of the 
financial autonomy at local administration level, the initiation 
of the restructuring process, the development of the small and 
medium business sector, the further liberalization of foreign 
trade, the making of the laws apt to support the reform. 
  "The official report of the United Nations Economic 
Commission assessed that, among all countries in transition, 
Romania is the surprise of the year 1993, because it managed 
economic growth (a positive 1 per cent on the gross domestic 
product, plus 1.3 per cent on industrial production, plus 12.4 
per cent on farm production), thus contradicting all Romanian 
and foreign prognoses estimating that economic decline was to go 
deeper by another 7-10 percentage points." 
  Concluding, the prime minister of Romania named among his 
government's actions for an ever greater opening of Romania in 
1994 to the world business spheres those regarding the alignment 
of export/import trade policies proper to market rules, 
attracting direct foreign capital investments by markedly 
liberal regulations and encouraging fiscal policies, improving 
leasing conditions and activating the free trade zones, 
intensifying the relations with the international bodies (IMF, 
EBRD, G-24), as well as actions directed at making progress 
towards Romania's association with the European Union.
