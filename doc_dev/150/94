  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 29/3/1994 -- "The visit paid by 
Minister Grachev is a first proof of a relaunch in the 
collaboration ties between Romania and the Russian Federation, 
holding a major contribution also on a political plane and not 
only on the military one," said the Romanian head of diplomacy 
Teodor Melescanu after the Monday [28 March] interview with 
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, currently 
on a visit to Romania at the invitation of his Romanian 
counterpart, Gheorghe Tinca. 
  The Romanian high official also said that during the talks 
stress was laid on the importance Romania was giving to the 
building of a security system at European level, which would 
ensure also Romania's security, which depends on other elements 
too such as the democratic process in Russia and the ties 
between the two countries. 
  In the context, both sides referred also to other security 
structures, pointing on the role held by the CSCE, the role of 
bilateral ties, as well as on the contribution of regional 
collaboration to bring stability in the area.
