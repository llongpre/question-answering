  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/3/1994 -- Romanian Premier 
Nicolae Vacaroiu received Thursday, March 31, Hans Blix, 
president of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
currently in Romania to make an inspection of the way in which 
works are being carried out at unit one of the atomic station of 
Cernavoda. 
  Hans Blix, voiced, on this occasion, the preoccupations of 
the world body he works with for permanent surveillance of the 
atomic stations in Eastern Europe, for support to be granted to 
them to improve their protection systems. The IAEA president 
showed interest in the creation in Romania of a unique authority 
for surveillance and control of nuclear activities, under the 
premier's direct subordination. 
  Premier Vacaroiu said that the government was interested 
that 
the Cernavoda atomic station start operation as soon as possible 
with respect of all international duties in the domain. 
  The director general of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency also met on Thursday with the Romanian Minister of the 
Industries, Dumitru Popescu. 
  Appreciating Mr. Hans Blix's visit in a very important 
moment 
when Romania prepares for the actuation of the first unit of the 
nuclear plant at Cernavoda, about 200 km east of Bucharest, the 
Romanian minister said after the meeting that the two parties 
agreed that the situation of the nuclear sector was vital for 
Romania's energy system as the conventional energy resources -- 
methane gas, oil -- were shrinking while the water power 
stations very expensive. 
  "Mr. Hans Blix's findings during the visit at the Cernavoda 
plant, the second in four years, concerning the security and 
quality standards of the works are encouraging us in speeding-up 
the finalisation of the works and in trying to find, together 
with the other cabinet members, the funds necessary for the 
completion and actuation of the unit one during the current 
year," said the Romanian minister. 
  The IAEA head and the Romanian minister approached also 
issues concerning the cooperation between the IAEA and the 
Romanian Ministry of Industries. The Vienna-based agency 
provides yearly the financial means for the training of about 
30-40 Romanian experts following specialization stages in 
various countries, said Minister Popescu. 
  Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, IAEA, was conferred, during a specific ceremony 
on March 31, the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of the Bucharest 
University. 
  During the laudatio, Professor Emil Constantinescu, 
chancellor of the Bucharest University, referred, alongside 
Blix's scientific merits, to his rich political and diplomatic 
activity, to the particular stress he lays on legal guarantees 
apt to prevent the use of atomic energy for purposes other than 
peaceful.
