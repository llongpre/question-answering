  [Excerpt] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 30/3/1994 -- [passage 
omitted] Romania's stance on the North Korean nuclear file was 
presented at today's news conference of the Romanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs by Simona Miculescu, deputy to the ministry's 
spokesman. 
  The statement shows that Romania's attitude to this issue 
derives from its position as party to the treaty of 
non-proliferation of nuclear arms, and that by joining this 
treaty the People's Democratic Republic of Korea voluntarily 
assumed to strictly, unconditionally abide by the international 
commitments to this end. 
  "We find it in the interest of security and peace in the 
Korean peninsula that the DPRK complies with the regulations of 
the guarantee agreement concluded with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], including inspections of the North-Korean 
nuclear plants. At the same time, it is obvious that to reach 
this target the direct negotiations between United States and 
the DPRK have to be resumed, as well as the dialogue between the 
North and South of Korea, a prime component of which should be 
the issue of denuclearising the Korean peninsula. 
  "The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pronounces for 
steps apt to favor such processes, which would contribute to 
defusing tension in the Korean peninsula, and for a negotiated 
settlement of the issues raised by the North Korean nuclear 
file," the Romanian Foreign Ministry's statement says.
