  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/2/1994 -- "The statements made 
by Mircea Snegur [president of the Republic of Moldova] and 
Dumitru Motpan [president of the Agrarian Democratic Party of 
Moldova] were to us extremely surprising, extremely grave," said 
Adrian Nastase, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania's 
Parliament. "They prove that a dangerous policy is currently 
conducted in the Republic of Moldova, either for political 
reasons or because of pressure from elsewhere. An anti-Romanian 
policy comes to the fore, which we have mentioned before. We 
were contradicted then, were told that the anti-Romanian policy 
was not a policy deliberately conducted in Chisinau. Now, we 
see that in fact these things were being secretly articulated in 
the basements of the policy of the Republic of Moldova. I 
believe our brothers across the Prut will know how to adequately 
react to these shifted stresses and even changed road in the 
policy promoted by the leadership in Chisinau. As for 
ourselves, we will have to draw the necessary conclusions for 
the future as concerns those with whom we can develop important, 
constructive and efficient political links in the period ahead," 
the Chamber of Deputies speaker said.
