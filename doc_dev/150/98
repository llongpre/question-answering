  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/5/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu sent a message to the leader of the African National 
Congress (ANC) whereby he appreciated the ANC success in the 
first all-race elections in South Africa as "a natural result of 
its (ANC) long-time and consistent efforts as well as to the 
sacrifices assumed by its leaders in order to achieve a 
South-African society beneficial to all its members, 
irrespective of race, religion or political option." 
  "At the same time, we appreciate the ANC victory," reads 
President Iliescu's message "as an expression of the confidence 
of a large share of the population in your political wisdom and 
in the ANC capacity of ensuring together with other political 
parties and forces a transition without violence, well-balanced, 
toward a society based on full equality of rights."
