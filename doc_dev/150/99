   Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, the darling of
the 1976 Olympics with her seven perfect 10s, landed flawlessly in
the United States Friday after her stunning defection three days
earlier.
   ``I wanted to have a free life,'' Comaneci, who was guaranteed
political asylum, said in halting English at a news conference at
John F. Kennedy International Airport.
   Asked how long she had thought about defecting, she replied, ``A
long time. I had it in my mind for a few years.''
   The 28-year-old Comaneci arrived on the Pan Am plane ``Liberty
Bell'' from Vienna just before 4:30 p.m., an airline spokesman said.
   Comaneci _ wearing a blue denim jacket, black shirt and jeans _
said she was not thinking about embarrassing her country's
government when she made her decision.
   ``It's not my business,'' she said. The Olympic gold medalist
also said she was looking forward to a change in lifestyle, ``I
know it will be different. I was nine times in the States, I know
the life here.''
   Comaneci was surrounded by Port Authority police as she walked
through the Pan Am terminal about 25 feet away from a horde of
reporters after her arrival. Clutching a bouquet of flowers,
Comaneci kept her head down as she entered a private Pan Am office
where she filled out forms.
   Comaneci appeared pale as she strode briskly through the
terminal, but the gymnast later smiled broadly as she walked toward
an airport lounge for a news conference.
   She was accompanied to her news conference by Konstantin Panit,
a Frenchman who said he was a friend of Comaneci.
   The gymnast was to spend the night in New York at an undisclosed
location, and two people familar with her plans who spoke only on
condition their names not be used said she intended to leave for
Miami on Saturday.
   Her former coach, Bela Karolyi, said earlier her final
destination was Indianapolis, headquarters of the U.S. Gymnastics
Federation. But Patti Auer, spokeswoman for the foundation, said
they had no word of Comaneci coming there.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel confirmed that
Comaneci, who fled her homeland for Hungary on Tuesday, had been
granted refugee status and was ``in the air on her way to this
country.''
   Comaneci contacted a U.S. Embassy in Europe on Friday morning
and was quickly granted that status, said State Department deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher, adding: ``We certainly welcome Ms.
Comaneci.''
   Refugee status means U.S. officials believe Comaneci has a
well-founded fear of persecution if she returns to Romania, where
the hard-line Marxist government has rejected the reformist tide
sweeping other East European countries.
   She would be eligible to apply for permanent resident status in
the U.S. in one year, U.S. officials who requested anonymity said.
   Comaneci has been in hiding since fleeing Romania. She
reportedly told a border guard she was leaving ``for the sake of
freedom.''
   Her whereabouts and plans were unknown until word of her
impending arrival in New York broke Friday. Karolyi had encouraged
Comaneci earlier this week to follow his example and come to the
United States.
   Karolyi defected from Romania in 1981. It was initially believed
Comaneci would return to the United States with Karolyi from
Stuttgart, West Germany.
   Karolyi, who coached the then 14-year-old Comaneci during her
perfect performances at the Montreal Olympics, told U.S. Gymnastics
Federation spokesperson Patti Auer ``it was a big relief'' to know
the gymnast was headed for the United States. Auer spoke Friday
with Karolyi from West Germany.
   ``I was concerned when I heard she left the Hungarian hotel in
an unmarked car, but I was confident that she knows the lesson _
that she needed to go to the American Embassy,'' she quoted Karolyi
as saying.
   Comaneci's defection was a blow to the hard-line government of
Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, who had named the 4-foot-11
gymnast a ``Hero of Socialist Labor'' for her accomplishments. She
was held up as a role model for Romanian youth.
   Comaneci won 21 gold medals in Olympic and other international
meets during her career, which won her a life of privilege in a
country that has endured chronic shortages of consumer goods for
most of this decade.
