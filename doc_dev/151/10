   JOHANNESBURG -- De Beers, the world's largest diamond
producer comprising Swiss-based De Beers Centenary AG and De
Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. of South Africa, reported a 16%
drop in net income for 1990.
   Combined net income of the two companies in 1990 fell to
US$950 million, or $2.50 a share, compared with $1.127
billion, or $2.96 a share, in 1989.

   Total dividend distribution amounted to $1.113, compared
with $1.102 the year before.
   Julian Ogilvie-Thompson, chairman of the De Beers diamond
group, said Tuesday he is optimistic that the world diamond
market will improve in 1991, after a "quiet year" in 1990. He
said a decline in profits had been expected, although the
Persian Gulf crisis aggravated the drop in retail sales.
   De Beers Centenary, which controls all group business
outside South Africa, including Botswana and Namibia, and
accounts for about 80% of total earnings, was established a
year ago to facilitate the group's access to international
markets. The South African business remains under the control
of De Beers Consolidated. The foreign and South African
securities trade as one unit.
