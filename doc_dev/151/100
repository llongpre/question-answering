The leading official in Russia's diamond industry said that his country's
present agreement with South African diamond group, De Beers, was 'far from
satisfactory' and would have to be radically changed.
But Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, chairman of the committee on precious metals and
stones, emphasised that Russia wanted to work with De Beers, dispelling
fears that the relationship between the group that controls more than 80 per
cent of world rough (uncut) diamond sales and one of the largest producers
was near to collapse.
Mr Bychkov wants the present agreement, which runs until the end of next
year, to be substantially modified, and wants to sign an agreement after
1995 'on a completely new basis'.
Earlier this month, De Beers seemed to believe that the relationship was in
danger and that the prospect of excluding Russia from the monopoly because
of allegedly unsanctioned sales of diamonds would have to be considered.
Mr Bychkov also resolutely denied the estimations, tabled by De Beers in
talks between the two sides this year, that 'leakages' of diamonds from
Russia outside of the agreement had totalled Dollars 500m (Pounds 316.4m)
this year. Mr Bychkov said that Russia had sold only Dollars 120m worth of
diamonds independently from De Beers - and that had been covered by
agreements with the company.
'Everything else sold is just small change. We know who is dealing illegally
in diamonds here and what they are selling is very little,' he said.
While Mr Bychkov would give few details of the negotiations between the two
partners, he indicated that he wanted Russia's quota within De Beers'
Central Selling Organisation (CSO) to be raised from its present 26 per cent
of total CSO sales because of growing production in Russia,
'We are producing more from Yakutia (the diamond producing region) than last
year and next year we expect to produce more than this. So we want our quota
to be raised,' Mr Bychkov said.
A rise in Russia's quota would mean a fall in that of the other member
countries - which include South Africa, Botswana and Australia.
Another area of negotiation and dispute between the two sides concerns the
joint ventures which Russia has formed with companies, especially from
Belgium and Israel, to send diamonds abroad for polishing. De Beers
considers that these consignments are exports - while Russia believes that,
since the diamonds remain the property of Russia and are returned to it,
they cannot be counted as exports.
The De Beers agreement allows Russia to sell freely only 5 per cent of the
diamonds it produces, while the remainder goes to the CSO. Mr Bychkov said
that 'the present agreement must be improved, and a future agreement made
mutually advantageous, which it is not at present'.
