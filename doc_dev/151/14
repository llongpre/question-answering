FT  15 AUG 92 / Man in the News: King of diamonds - Julian Ogilvie Thompson

Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, the South African company
that controls the world diamond market, spent yesterday in the Northern
Transvaal. It should have been a happy outing, attending the opening of De
Beers' new R1.1bn (Pounds 200m) Venetia mine, a project which should produce
5.9m carats of diamonds a year.
He could have been forgiven, however, if the prospect of more diamonds had
left him feeling slightly queasy. With unfortunate timing, the opening
coincided with what was probably the worst week for De Beers since the
collapse of the diamond market in 1981-82.
Tuesday's announcement from the board, meeting in Kimberley, that there
would probably be a 'substantial reduction' in the final dividend did not
only knock about 18 per cent off the share price but also precipitated a
heavy fall in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It led to accusations that De
Beers had misled the market, thus dealing a blow to the credibility of one
of South Africa's best-known companies.
The patrician, self-assured Ogilvie Thompson, also chairman of the Anglo
American mining house and its offshore associate Minorco, may be the world's
most powerful mining executive, but he will have been ill-prepared for the
assault unleashed on his judgment and that of De Beers. Both in
Johannesburg, and to a lesser extent offshore, there has been widespread
criticism of the handling of the dividend cut.
De Beers sought to defend itself with a statement on Thursday which starts:
'The allegations that De Beers has lost credibility are unfair and
ill-founded.' Later in the statement, Ogilvie Thompson adds: 'Our
credibility hinges on our being honest and I believe that is exactly what we
have been . . . it was precisely because we did not want to mislead the
market that we warned of a final dividend cut.'
There is little sympathy for this reasoning in Johannesburg. When things are
going well, people are prepared to tolerate the high-handed behaviour for
which De Beers and Anglo are noted. But when a bitter pill is to be
delivered, companies need better investor relations than those enjoyed by De
Beers and Ogilvie Thompson if a hostile reaction is to be avoided.
The nub of the problem is that until early July, Ogilvie Thompson continued
to predict higher rough diamond sales by the Central Selling Organisation
(CSO) - the De Beers organisation which markets about 80 per cent of the
world's rough diamonds - in the second half of 1992. Although these bullish
sentiments were at odds with market signals, most observers chose to allow
De Beers the benefit of the doubt, given the company's record of accurate
forecasting.
But Tuesday's announcement indicated that De Beers had got it wrong. The
dividend cut and the imposition of quotas, whereby the CSO buys 25 per cent
less than its contractual commitment from producers, reflect the extent of
the error. The board said two factors - which only became fully apparent in
mid-July - combined to stymie their earlier forecast: flat demand, when an
economic upturn was expected, accentuated by the 'precipitous plunge' in
Tokyo's Nikkei index; and the 'sudden and unprecedented explosion' in the
supply of illicit diamonds from Angola.
Some industry analysts do not believe the outlook for the market could have
changed as quickly as De Beers suggests. Of the two factors mentioned, there
is sympathy for the Angolan problem, but little for wrongly predicting an
economic upturn.
Critics suggest that De Beers should not have been so bullish. Part of the
reason why De Beers' announcement was greeted by such a furore this week is
that Anglo and De Beers are famous for their conservative financial
orientation. Ogilvie Thompson exemplifies this conservative culture. Son of
a former Chief Justice of South Africa, and a Rhodes scholar, he has grown
up in the image of the Oppenheimer family, following Harry Oppenheimer,
whose personal assistant he was for four years, to become chairman of the
two groups. Like his predecessor at De Beers, he has cultivated an
exquisitely polite, highly Anglicised manner - reflected in his preferences
for French wines, shooting and fishing.
His manner and tastes sit uneasily in the rough and tumble business world of
Johannesburg. Though his ability and voracious work appetite are
acknowledged, many in the South African investment community are riled by a
regal manner which is too obviously a 'cut above' for many people's taste.
He is regarded as the personification of Anglo's arrogance: 'that arrogance
that people come to Anglo, Anglo doesn't go the people,' in the words of one
observer.
There has been a simple reason for the stand-offishness - De Beers and Anglo
have been financially self-sufficient, neither having had a rights issue.
Neither has, therefore, needed the investment community, which they have
kept at arm's length. Complex interlocking shareholdings, pivotally
controlled by the Oppenheimer family, have also put the companies beyond the
reach of corporate raiders.
This week's controversy has again raised questions about the quality of
management at Anglo. The question is also being asked whether Ogilvie
Thompson isn't spreading himself too thinly by being chairman,
simultaneously, of three large companies.
Pressure is also mounting for improved disclosure from De Beers. Investors
are prepared to accept secrecy when De Beers gets things right, but not when
it gets things wrong.
At the Venetia opening yesterday, Harry Oppenheimer conceded that De Beers
was facing 'grave, immediate difficulties'. He went on, though, to say that
these are 'the sort that we understand and have faced successfully at many
times in the past'. Unfortunately, he was not talking about investor
relations. Ogilvie Thompson may find it harder to rebuild trust with
investors than to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium in the
diamond market - though achieving the latter would doubtless help the
former.
