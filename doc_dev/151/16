   JOHANNESBURG -- De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the
world's largest diamond producer, said it is holding diamonds
in London as collateral against a $1 billion loan to the
Soviet Union in light of the country's political upheaval.
   De Beers Centenery AG, the company's Swiss arm, lent the
money to the Soviet Union in July 1990 as part of a five-year
deal to sell a $5 billion rough-diamond stockpile for the
Soviets.

   In the deal, described at the time as the first of its
kind by a Western company, the loan was to be repaid over
five years beginning in November 1990 to help meet the Soviet
Union's import arrears.
   The Soviet Union reached the deal with De Beers because it
wanted to sell a huge stockpile of diamonds without
disrupting the stable diamond market, De Beers said.
   De Beers established De Beers Centenery in May 1990 to
head its non-South African business.
