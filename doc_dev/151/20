<F P=106> [Article by M. de V.: "De Beers, the Untouchable"] </F>
  [Text] Founded more than a century ago, this conglomerate 
with a world monopoly on the diamond trade remains faithful to 
itself: secretive, hegemonic, paternalistic, and sure of its 
future... 
  "I know from experience that the only possible way to 
safeguard the stability of the sector is by limiting the supply 
of diamonds and selling through a single distribution network," 
Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, president of de Beers at the turn of the 
century, used to say. Faithful to itself, and faithful to this 
principle, the conglomerate founded in 1888 by Cecil 
Rhodes--creator of Rhodesia, obsessed by Great Britain's 
expansion into Africa--owns half the world's production of uncut 
diamonds and markets 80 percent. 
  Since 1931, diamonds have escaped the almost constant 
erosion 
of prices of other raw materials. A miraculous survivor among 
luxury products, this "king of gems" and "teardrop of the gods" 
is still in insolently good health; and de Beers, a fairly 
accurate gauge of the industry's condition since it holds the 
monopoly on diamonds, is in equally excellent shape: The group's 
turnover for 1993 was $4.444 billion, compared to $3.640 the 
preceding year. In this recessionary period, it is probably the 
only one to have recorded "record sales," and it displays a 
serenity and faith in its own future that would be the envy of 
many other companies. 
  Its assurance is expressed in more than mere words: de Beers 
is making long-term investments, on several fronts, with 
astonishing audacity: in the conquest of new markets--its budget 
for this is almost unequalled anywhere--in consolidation--with 
all its uncertainties!--in agreements with producer countries, 
in exploring new deposits, and above all in constantly keeping 
supply in balance with demand--even when stocks are 
excessive...and cost is no object. 
  Zaire thinks it is independent enough to start selling 
stones 
directly to Israeli diamond cutters? Well, then, de Beers just 
signs an exclusive contract with Israel and buys them up itself. 
The guerrillas in Angola have decided to go into the diamond 
business? It spends $400 million to block the deal. Russia 
"forgets" the protocols it signed? It renegotiates, slowly but 
surely convincing the backsliders--by what means?--to get back 
in line, i.e., the de Beers line. In addition, it monitors and 
controls the distribution system with such arrogant precision 
that it sells to its clients "only as much as is likely to be 
sold." It prefers to hoard all the rest, to make sure the 
cutters do not warehouse too much merchandise. 
<H5>  Hegemony </H5>
  Does de Beers behave like a sovereign government? Is it 
authoritarian, even hegemonic, behind its velvet facade? 
Certainly. But one must admit it has succeeded where 
international agreements and producer cartels have failed. 
Secretive--it seems to keep key information under wraps as part 
of its power strategy--and paternalistic, it is reaping the 
fruits of its founders' vision. 
  What did Harry Oppenheimer, son of Ernest, say back in 1948? 
"All workers should participate in the success of their business 
and should benefit directly from its profits; apartheid, which 
amounts to disguised slavery in the mines, can lead only to 
impasse." And he supported the creation of miners' unions in the 
sector. Because stable labor relations, as he saw it, were key 
to steady production. 
  So de Beers today is cultivating "courteous" relations with 
Mandela's entourage. In that regard, it is significant that the 
former secretary general of the miners' union, Cyril Ramaphosa, 
number-two man in the ANC, is the announced successor to Mandela. 
  This attractive blend of fine-tuned philanthropy and 
judicious liberalism is characteristic of de Beers. Neither 
Cecil Rhodes nor the Oppenheimer dynasty would take offense at 
the charming words the company's current president has to say 
about Mandela. Because the company has already taken appropriate 
precautions to protect its wealth: In 1990, when the ANC 
revealed its intent to nationalize South African companies, de 
Beers immediately transferred its capital to Lucerne, 
Switzerland. 
  In South Africa itself, nothing remains but the extraction 
company (de Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd.). Whatever happens in 
South African politics, Julian Ogilvie Thompson can still sleep 
soundly on a pillow of diamonds.
