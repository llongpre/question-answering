   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said it is raising the average price of rough uncut diamonds 13.5% because the market is so buoyant. 

   Although dealers must wait for details when De Beers has a sale early next month, some said prices for quality diamonds valued at $4,000 or more could rise as much as 20%. 

   A spokesman for the South African concern, which controls 80% of the diamond market, said retail jewelers, manufacturers and dealers have shrugged off the stock market crash and have been vigorous buyers of large and small gems. 

   Dealers said the diamond market has been strong during the past year mainly because of growing retail jewelry demand, rather than investment-market demand. 
Total sales of diamond jewelry rose to 57.6 million pieces valued at $31 billion last year from 52.4 million valued at $27.6 billion in 1986, De Beers estimates. 

   In the months right after the stock market crash there was "hesitancy in the diamond markets," said De Beers's chairman, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, in the company's latest annual report. 
But De Beers "responded by severely reducing its sales" in November and December to steady the market, he said. 
The reduction in supplies and good Christmas sales restored confidence in recent months, the official said. 

   Some diamond analysts said dealers may find it difficult to absorb De Beers latest price increase, particularly since it followed a 10% rise in prices in early October. 
With the lastest increase, the company's average prices will have risen 52% since 1982, analysts said. 
The diamond market could also turn sour if stock markets begin to slide again, dealers said. 

   "The market is quiet at the moment; I don't believe that the timing is right," said Jo Flies, chief economist at the Antwerp Diamond High Council, a trade group in Belgium. 

   But Hong Kong jewelers at a large annual jewelry and watch fair this month in Basel, Switzerland, said diamond sales would remain strong in fast-growing Far Eastern economies. 

   Japan now accounts for 21% of world diamond jewelry sales, after the U.S., which has a 39% share, De Beers said. 
Taiwan has slashed import duties so already firm consumption could improve further, the company said. 

   The investment market for diamonds remains quiet, although quotes of the D-Flawless investment diamond have risen to around $17,000 a carat from $14,000 last fall. 
Those prices compare with levels around $55,000 in 1980, prior to the diamond recession of the early 1980s.
