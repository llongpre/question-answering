   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- The world's largest diamond
producer, the combined operations of Switzerland's De Beers
Centenary AG and South Africa's De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd., reported a larger-than-expected 20% drop in earnings
for 1991.
   Net income fell to $763 million from $950 million a year
earlier.

   Analysts, who had forecast a 12% decline in earnings, said
they knew diamond sales and interest earnings would be lower.
What they didn't expect was a higher effective tax rate.
   Although pretax profit was down 16% to $1.03 billion, the
tax paid in 1991 was unchanged at $254 million.
   De Beers Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson gave no
explanation for the identical tax charge.
   One analyst suggested De Beers might be expecting a poor
1992 performance and thus manipulated the 1991 numbers to
create a lower base for comparison.
   Analysts said the decline stemmed specifically from the 6%
decline in rough diamond sales for 1991, stagnant diamond
prices and increased costs. De Beers hasn't raised its prices
since March 1990.
