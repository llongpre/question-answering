   LONDON -- De Beers Centenary AG said it will open a
representative office in Moscow.
   "The office further cements the relationship between the
company and the Russian diamond industry," said Nicholas
Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers Centenary, the
Swiss-based, but South African-owned corporation that
controls around 80% of the world market in rough, uncut
diamonds.

   In July 1990, De Beers announced a $5 billion agreement to
sell Soviet diamonds during a five-year period. It also lent
the Soviet Union $1 billion against collateral of diamonds
held in London.
   Rossalmazzoloto, a former Soviet diamond industry
organization now under the authority of the Russian republic,
is honoring the sales contract, according to Gary Ralfe, the
De Beers director in charge of trade with the former Soviet
Union. Moreover, De Beers received repayments of $200
million, reducing its loan to $800 million, he said. The
repayments came from the sale of newly produced diamonds and
stocks held as collateral by De Beers, said Mr. Ralfe.
   Russia mines at least 15 million carats of diamonds a year
in Yakutia on the Kola peninsula. A carat equals 1/142 of an
ounce.
   A few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that
Russians and South Africans -- the two largest producers of
gold, platinum, diamonds, manganese and a variety of other
strategic minerals -- would be openly doing business.
