<HEAD>Angola Re-enters Diamond Cartel</HEAD>

   Angola, a major diamond producing nation, is
re-entering the De Beers diamond cartel after five years, De Beers
said Thursday.
   Endiama, the Angolan state diamond company, and De Beers
Centenary AG on Thursday signed an agreement re-establishing their
relationship, De Beers said.
   Under the agreement, De Beer's Central Selling Organization will
market Angola's diamonds from its Cuango region, or about
three-quarters of the country's annual production of one million
carats, said Roger van Eeghen, a De Beers spokesman.
   De Beers also will provide Endiama with a $50 million loan to
increase production in the Cuango area, and another $50 million
over the next five years to develop other diamond sources in
Angola.
   Angola had been marketing its diamonds independently since 1985
after civil war prompted De Beers to pull out, Van Eeghen said.
   About 80 percent of the world's annual diamond production is
sorted and sold by the London-based Central Selling Organization.
It had diamond sales of $4.1 billion in 1989.
