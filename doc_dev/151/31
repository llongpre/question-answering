   Minorco S.A. bid #2.05 billion (US$3.44 billion) for the 70.6% stake it doesn't already own of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, in a bold push for world expansion by South Africa's most powerful mining dynasty. 

   Minorco currently holds 29.4% of London-based Consolidated Gold, considered the largest gold-mining company outside South Africa and a major holder of other mineral interests in the U.S., Australia and the U.K. Minorco itself is 60.1%-owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold- and diamond-mining interests of South Africa's influential Oppenheimer family. 

   Consolidated, founded 101 years ago by empire builder Cecil Rhodes, rejected the bid as a "very damaging" act of "assetstripping." 
Whatever the financial merits, the bid could turn upside down the alliances that control the world's precious metals industry. 

   Moreover, it raises a number of political issues. 
It seems to be an attempt by Anglo American and De Beers to protect Minorco, a holding company they moved from Bermuda to the European Community state of Luxembourg last year, from the political implications of South Africa's apartheid policy. 
Besides immunizing Minorco from possible future sanctions against South Africa, it could protect the company against upheavals inside the country that someday might lead to nationalization of major companies. 

   Like most South African businesses, De Beers and Anglo American aren't discussing such possibilities. 
And whether their bid to establish Minorco as European will succeed remains to be seen. 
Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Minorco and De Beers's chairman, denied speculation that the group might shift De Beers' lucrative diamond-marketing operations into Minorco's hands. 

   In addition, the move could raise political concerns in Britain as well as the U.S., where Consolidated has expanding interests. 
Last year Consolidated raised its stake in New York-based Newmont Mining Corp. to 49.7%, helping to defend Newmont from a bid by an investor group led by Texas oil man, T. Boone Pickens Jr. 

   A British special interest group yesterday voiced its opposition to the takeover and called on Lord Young, trade and industry secretary, to use his powers to block the move. 
"If it succeeds then the tentacles of the apartheid economy will have reached even farther into Britain," said Mike Terry, executive secretary of the Anti-Apartheid Movement. 
"It would also be a major setback for the disinvestment campaign, as it has been widely predicted that Consolidated Gold Fields would pull out in the near future." 

   Minorco said it would offer #9.50 in cash plus new Minorco shares for each Consolidated share, valuing the offer at #13.06 ($21.90) a share. 
The offer values the entire company at about #2.9 billion ($4.86 billion), the largest bid here since Nestle S.A.'s #2.55 billion purchase of confectionery maker Rowntree PLC earlier this year. 

   Analysts predicted Minorco would have to spend more to prevail. 
Consolidated shares were quoted in late trading yesterday on London's Stock Exchange at #14, up #3.22. 
Minorco was quoted at $12.87, down seven cents. 

   Consolidated holds a crucial position in the intricate web of relationships among the world's mining powers. 
Cozy industry ties sometimes turn nasty. 
In Consolidated's centenary history, Paul Johnson wrote that the major players cooperate but are also "mutual predators, capable of engaging at short notice in atrocious acts of cannibalism." 
Minorco held its news conference yesterday at London's Butchers Hall. 

   Mr. Ogilvie Thompson outlined plans to make Consolidated-Minorco a "major world force in the natural resources field." 
Minorco yesterday named as deputy chairman and chief executive officer Sir Michael Edwardes, a South African-born executive known for his leadership of such British companies as Rover Group, the long-suffering auto maker recently acquired by British Aerospace PLC. 

   Minorco said the merged company would seek to reduce its passive investments, selling off the South African mining operations that still generate 15% of Consolidated's operating profit. 
Minorco last year sold some of its own passive holdings, including a stake in securities firm Salomon Bros. 
Inc., raising its cash holdings to $890 million. 
Minorco said the Newmont stake could be reduced as well, noting the agreement with Newmont constrains Consolidated "from exercising any reasonable degree of control over it for many years." 

   Shares issued under the bid would reduce De Beers and Anglo American's total holding in Minorco to about 40.9% from the 60.1% currently held. 
And De Beers and Anglo American yesterday said they believe that "in today's climate, Minorco can best grow and prosper as an international company if it is properly independent." 

   De Beers and Anglo American hold significant stakes in each other. 
The extent of the Oppenheimer family's interests aren't disclosed by the companies. 

   The two South African companies said they don't plan to play a "day-to-day" role in Minorco, although they would continue to be represented on the company's board and Mr. Ogilvie Thompson would remain chairman of both De Beers and Minorco. 

   Anthony Hichens, a managing director of Consolidated, warned of opposition from U.S. and U.K. governments, and Consolidated officials suggested the sale of South African interests and Newmont would be aimed at minimizing anti-apartheid opposition to Minorco. 
Still, local governments might refuse to buy road-building materials from the merged company, he said. 
"In the end there would be an uproar and our employees and shareholders would suffer," Mr. Hichens said. 

   De Beers and Anglo American acquired the initial stake in Consolidated in 1980, in a "dawn raid" maneuver that was reviewed by the government and led to a change in stock-exchange rules here. 
Consolidated since has made great effort to stress its distance from the Oppenheimers, although Mr. Ogilvie Thompson serves on its board. 

   In the fiscal year ended June 30, Consolidated said net income rose 29% to #214.8 million on a 13% gain in revenue to #1.23 billion. 
Pretax profit jumped 24% to #302.4 million. 
Debt increased from a year earlier, reflecting the investment in Newmont. 
Minorco in the year ended June 30 reported that income from operations rose 58% to $103.9 million, while net income jumped six-fold to $774.7 million because of the disposals.
