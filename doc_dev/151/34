<HEAD>De Beers To Raise Rough Gem Diamond Prices 5.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said Wednesday it
will raise the prices of rough gem diamonds sold through its
Central Selling Organization by an average 5.5 percent effective
Monday.
   Vigorous consumer demand and a need to keep prices in line with
global inflation prompted the rise, said De Beers spokesman Andrew
Lamont.
   De Beers pushed prices up 15.5 percent in its last increase in
March 1989.
   The organization's sales were down 2 percent at $4.09 billion
last year and are expected to be flat this year.
   Rough diamonds yielding polished diamonds of one carat and less
have been selling at a premium in the open diamond bourses not run
by the Central Selling Organization for the last several months,
reflecting the strong demand, De Beers said.
   Polished diamonds currently fetching between $400 and $3,500 a
carat, are experiencing particularly strong demand, and will bear
the brunt of the price increase, Lamont said.
   De Beers doesn't disclose its prices, which vary considerably.
The wholesale price of the highest grade one-carat gem is about
$16,000.
   The organization sorts and values about 80 percent of the
world's rough diamonds before selling them to wholesalers at
regular sales called ``sights.''
