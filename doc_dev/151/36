   LONDON -- The diamond market is beginning to bottom out,
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said.
   Rough, uncut diamond sales of $2.1 billion in the first
half were 23% higher than in the final six months of 1990,
the company said.

   But the market is still uncertain, a De Beers official
added. First half turnover was 16% lower than in the
year-earlier period, and sales tend to be higher in the
initial six months of each year, dealers said.
   Total turnover of De Beers, which controls 80% of the
rough, uncut diamond market, was $4.2 billion, last year,
against $4.1 billion in 1989.
   "It is too soon to say whether a recovery is under way," a
spokesman for De Beers said, adding: "A rebound in the U.S.
economy should help the diamond market in the second half."
   The diamond market was weak in the three quarters ended in
March, mainly because of the Gulf War and the downturn in
U.S. jewelry sales, diamond dealers said.
   But Israel, the second-largest diamond market in the
world, raised orders for diamonds as soon as the war ended,
the De Beers official said. Nevertheless, the market remains
muted, dealers said. U.S. retail diamond sales were down in
the first half, while orders in Japan and Germany were
"flat."
   The recovery of the dollar raised the price of diamonds in
local currencies, dealers said, and slowing business
conditions lowered the demand for luxury goods, they added.
   To help revive the market, the advertising and promotional
budget of De Beers and the diamond jewelry trade will be
about $180 million, the company said.
