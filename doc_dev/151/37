De Beers, the South African company which dominates the world diamond trade,
is lifting its total 1993 dollar dividend by 7 per cent. The lift confirms
the stout turnround in the diamond business from the difficult conditions in
1992.
The dividend is increased to 84.4 US cents a share from 79.1 cents in 1992.
Earnings rose 16 per cent to 230 cents from 199 cents a share.
The shares reacted strongly to the news, climbing to a new high of R116 on
the Johannesburg stock exchange, before retreating to R115 at the close. Mr
Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was 'pleased' with the results,
which were underpinned by the first increase in four years in global retail
diamond sales.
The group's Central Selling Organisation (CSO) sold a record Dollars 4.37bn
in rough diamonds in 1993, against Dollars 3.42bn the year before, led by
good demand in the US and east Asia. Mr Jeremy Pudney, CSO marketing
director, said Korea, Taiwan and Thailand had overtaken France and Germany
as the group's most important markets after the US, Japan and Italy.
However, demand in Japan and Italy remained weak.
Mr Gary Ralfe, a director, said the group's relationship with Russia
remained uneasy, although sales in December of uncut diamonds from the
country's Treasury stockpile - in breach of a marketing agreement between De
Beers and the government - had not been repeated so far this year.
Pre-tax income rose to Dollars 789m from Dollars 728m, reflecting the
overall improvement in the jewellery trade and an increased contribution
from South African operations, boosted by the build-up to full production at
its new Venetia mine.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson said results from Centenary, De Beers' Swiss-based arm,
were hit by retrenchment costs at Namibian mines and the Irish-based
industrial diamond division, plus its smaller share of total diamond sales
as Venetia's output increased.
