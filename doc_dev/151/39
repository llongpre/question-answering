FT  09 MAY 94 / African empire open to the world: Anglo American and De
Beers have much to celebrate

Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of Anglo American Corporation, the world's
largest natural resources group, had two reasons for celebration at the
weekend.
There was the successful outcome of the first all-race elections in South
Africa, where Anglo dominates the economy.
There was also a 60th anniversary party in London for the Central Selling
Organisation, the most successful cartel in history, accounting as it does
for 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds. The CSO belongs to
De Beers, another element in Mr Harry Oppenheimer's industrial empire and
another company which has Mr Ogilvie Thompson as chairman.
Anglo and De Beers are emerging from difficult years of apartheid, isolation
and frequent tension with their government. Mr Ogilvie Thompson has to
ensure that the empire continues to flourish as South Africa rejoins the
rest of the world, a South Africa that, he believes, has the capacity to
grow economically as fast as Brazil did in the late 1960s and 1970s.
Apartheid, he says, was economically disastrous for South Africa, in that it
'stopped the clock'. But the delay in bringing in electoral reform had one
big advantage: 'The system of socialism and central planning as practised in
Russia and eastern Europe has been shown not to work.'
Among other things, this means that Anglo is no longer such a natural target
for an ANC-controlled government either to break-up into its mining,
industrial and investment parts, or to nationalise. The ANC, he says, has
been 'on a great trek to economic sanity'.
He says the degree of Anglo's domination of the country's economy has been
exaggerated. However, by its own 1993 calculations, Anglo represents about
25 per cent of the Johannesburg stock exchange and 6 to 7 per cent of South
Africa's capital assets.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson insists that small countries such as South Africa cannot
afford US-style anti-trust legislation if they are to have companies that
can compete internationally. Sweden and the Netherlands show what can be
done. Anglo is urging the new government to have an independent inquiry into
competition policy. 'I can't believe that the country will be so silly as to
penalise success.'
And if Anglo were to be split up, the likely buyers would be existing
pension funds and other institutional investors. It would do little for
black empowerment, he says. Instead Anglo is promoting black ownership of
business, for example, by prompting the 'unbundling' of Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments (JCI), a mining and industrial concern in which
Anglo and De Beers hold nearly 50 per cent, in a way that should transfer
control of some assets to black investors. The Sowetan newspaper is also
being transferred to black ownership. And last year Anglo spent about R100m
(Pounds 13.7m) buying products and services from small mainly black-owned,
businesses that it had encouraged with training and, sometimes, financial
help. 'You need big businesses for exports but small businesses create most
of the jobs,' says Mr Ogilvie Thompson.
However, Anglo remains very much an anachronism when viewed by international
investors. It is a huge, centralised group with complex cross shareholdings
that, according to its critics, renders management unaccountable to
shareholders. The complicated control structure ensures that Anglo remains a
family business, even though Mr Harry Oppenheimer, 84-year-old son of the
founder, retired as chairman 12 years ago.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson admits: 'We have a major job to get our structure
understood. We must improve our presentation of ourselves.' But he insists
Anglo is not a conglomerate in the 1980s American style, it has not
developed by acquiring companies for shares but by starting most from
scratch and 'following our noses'. Its metallurgical skills lead it to set
up the Highveld steel company, for example. He recalls that the South
African mining industry developed the way it did because of shortages of
capital and skills. 'When you had a good metallurgist, you shared him among
several companies.'
Anglo has been 'tidying up' its structure to make it more logical. Most of
the industrial assets have been moved into Amic (Anglo American Industrial
Corporation). A reshuffle of assets between Anglo and Minorco, its
Luxembourg-registered offshore investment arm, has ensured there will be no
conflict of interest - Anglo searches for mineral opportunities in Africa,
Minorco gets the rest of the world.
There is still some tidying up to do and more non-core assets will be sold,
such as the Argus newspaper operations being acquired by Mr Tony O'Reilly's
Independent Newspaper group.
But 10 years from now, the Anglo-De Beers group will not look much
different, Mr Ogilvie Thompson says. The relationship between Anglo and De
Beers - cemented by substantial cross shareholdings - has worked well for
years and there is no reason to suppose it will not go on doing so. De Beers
concentrates on the diamond business. Anglo will continue to invest in
diamonds through De Beers and continue to provide De Beers' technical needs
 -'that way we can offer the people we hire much wider scope'.
De Beers needs a very strong balance sheet to be able to finance the troughs
in diamond demand or sudden increases in supply. So it will continue to
build up investment in 'a portfolio of companies competently run, because De
Beers' people need to put all their concentration on diamonds'.
Cashflows will be used for businesses the group knows well. Anglo's profile
might change slightly if South African exchange controls are removed and it
can invest abroad. But as Minorco is cash-rich and unhampered by the
restrictions, 'we are not champing at the bit for that to happen'.
He suggests South Africa should work towards the removal of exchange
controls but 'timing is everything. We cannot run the risk of capital being
withdrawn in a hurry.'
The staying power of the group is well illustrated by De Beers' Central
Selling Organisation which yesterday welcomed clients from all over the
world for a 60th anniversary party.
After last year's record performance - CSO sales reached Dollars 4.4bn
(Pounds 3bn), some 5 per cent ahead of the previous record in 1988 - the
diamond market 'opened firm' this year, says Mr Ogilvie Thompson.
Nevertheless, De Beers faces some substantial challenges.
It is still restricting the quantities of stones it takes from producers who
belong to the cartel - only 85 per cent of those contracted for. This is a
clear sign that supply continues to outpace demand. And stocks are already
high - De Beers' own have a book value of about Dollars 4bn and probably
have a much higher market value.
But the biggest threat to the cartel is Russia, which supplies about 25 per
cent of the world's gem diamonds by value, and whose contract with the CSO
runs out next year. Mr Ogilvie Thompson has already scolded the Russians for
selling diamonds from their stocks 'in contravention of our agreements'.
He says most of those officials in Russia who have been in the diamond
business for years want to stay with the CSO.
Others, such as Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Komdragmet, the Russian diamond
and precious stones committee, 'are not totally committed. We have 18 months
to convince them that it is in their best interests.'
