   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the huge South
African diamond mining concern, said today it would split itself in
two and base one of the newly formed companies in Switzerland.
   The move appeared to be an attempt by the company to minimize
its exposure to potential political turbulence in South Africa,
where a newly energized black majority has vowed to nationalize
major industries if it wins power from the white minority.
   But De Beers Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson denied that there
were political reasons for the company's split, saying it reflected
the international nature of De Beers and the diamond business and
that it was in the interests of shareholders and the industry. He
also said the company's earnings jumped 37 percent last year.
   Thompson made his comments at a Johannesburg news conference to
which London reporters were hooked up.
   De Beers' shares jumped 1.80 pounds, or $2.97, to 13.63 pounds,
or $22.49, on London's Stock Exchange today after Thompson spoke.
   The South African company will continue to be called De Beers
Consolidated Mines. De Beers' foreign businesses, which accounted
for 80 percent of De Beers' 1989 net profit, will be grouped under
a Swiss company to be called De Beers Centenary AG, it said.
   De Beers said it would split itself by giving existing
shareholders one share in the Centenary company for each De Beers
share they already own.
   Ogilvie Thompson also denied that the decision was linked to the
failure of Minorco SA's failed hostile takeover bid for the British
mining company Consolidated Gold Fields PLC last year. That bid by
Minorco, which is controlled by De Beers and the Anglo American
Corp., was seen as a move by the gold and diamond mining empire to
diversify away from South Africa.
   Ogilvie Thompson said the plan had been under active discussion
since last year.
   De Beers said its earnings for 1989 came to 2.87 billion rand,
about $1.1 billion at current exchange rates, vs. 2.09 billion rand
in 1988. Revenue rose 31 percent to 4.2 billion rand from 3.2
billion rand.
   The company didn't break out quarterly or six-month results.
