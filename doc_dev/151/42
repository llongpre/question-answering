DIAMOND SMUGGLING from Russia is adding to the turmoil in the market for the
precious stone, De Beers admitted yesterday, but the group, which controls
80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, said it had no clear
idea of the extent of the leakage.
Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers director responsible for liaison with the
Russians, said it was impossible to tell how many diamonds were being
smuggled from the former Soviet Union.
He believed the smuggling was taking place without the sanction of the
government authorities and that the Russian problem was nothing compared
with the illicit flood of diamonds out of Angola where an estimated Dollars
1m worth a day are being smuggled to Antwerp.
He said he understood some rough gems were being smuggled out by joint
ventures which only had the right to export polished stones. Mr Ralfe said
he could not disclose official figures for Russian diamond output but denied
one suggestion that production had fallen from 11m to 4m carats. 'We sell
well in excess of 4m carats a year.'
It also became clear yesterday De Beers faces competition from Japan in
Yakutia, where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes
to help set up a cutting centre.
In any case, the South African group is not confident of its grip on the
Russian diamonds business and therefore wants to reconfirm its existing
five-year contract which gives it a virtual monopoly of Russia's rough
diamond exports.
De Beers concluded an agreement in 1990 which gives its Central Selling
Organisation exclusive rights to sell Russian rough diamonds exports until
1995. It advanced a Dollars 1bn loan to the former Soviet Union against
stockpiled diamonds which were moved to London.
Though Russia has continued to abide by the terms of the deal the agreement
has often been called into question. Mr Nicky Oppenheimer, De Beers deputy
chairman, said: 'We hope that uncertainty in the diamond market will be
ended by a pronouncement of the diamond commission which should show that
CSO is Russia's best opportunity.'
