   The world's largest diamond producer De Beers, comprising
the Swiss-based international company De Beers Centenary AG
and South Africa's De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., said net
income fell 14% in the first half.
   Profit totaled $446 million, or $1.17 a share, down from
$517 million, or $1.36 a share, a year earlier.

   De Beers also said it would trim its dividend to 24.7
cents a share from 24.8 cents a share.
   De Beers blamed the Persian Gulf War for the downturn.
   "The disruption caused to the world economic conditions by
the Gulf War at the beginning of the year reflected adversely
on the world diamond market," the company said.
   The results were in line with analysts' expectations.
