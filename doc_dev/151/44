<F P=106> [Joint communique issued by the Russian Federation and De </F>
Beers Consolidate Mines issued on 18 May on the SAPA PR Wire 
Service] 
  [Text] On 17th May, 1994 discussions were held in Moscow 
between a Russian delegation headed by the acting minister of 
finance, Sergey Dubinin and a delegation from De Beers 
Centenary, headed by the chairman of the Central Selling 
Organisation, Nicky Oppenheimer. 
  The new series of official discussions, of which this was 
the 
first, is aimed at considering modifications to the existing 
marketing agreement between Russia and De Beers in response to 
the political and socio-economic changes that have taken place 
in Russia since it was signed. Further meetings on the subject 
will take place in the near future. The parties remain 
committed to the existing agreement, pending their agreeing on 
any modification. They are also committed to the stability of 
the international diamond market and to taking the necessary 
steps to curtail Russian rough gem diamonds reaching the market 
outside the current marketing arrangements. 
  During the discussions the parties re-iterated their joint 
responsibility, as the world's two largest gem diamond 
producers, to the international diamond market and to the 
well-being of the world diamond community. The parties hope 
that the new series of discussions will re-establish a solid 
base for on-going co-operation into the future and thereby 
ensure the further development of the international diamond 
business, to their mutual benefit and to the benefit of the 
entire diamond industry.
