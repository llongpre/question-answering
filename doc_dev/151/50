friend survives a crisis - Antwerp is still the diamond capital of Europe

When Pete Sampras swept to victory in the European Union tennis
championships in Antwerp this month, he picked up a rare first prize.
Instead of the standard cheque, Sampras, the world's number one tennis
player, won a diamond-encrusted racquet. It was a testimony to the
champion's heavyweight serve, but also to Antwerp's skill in promoting
itself as the diamond capital of Europe
After a sluggish 1992, Antwerp is bouncing back.
Revelling in its designated role this year as Europe's cultural capital, the
city has devised a succession of glittering events to showcase the diamond
trade, an industry whose roots in Flanders go back to the 17th century.
Perhaps the most eye-catching was the exhibition called 'From the Treasury'
which featured more than 10,000 carats of diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and
rubies. The jewels came from the Romanov family of Russia, Thurn and Taxis
of Germany, from the late Duchess of Windsor's collection and from other
distinguished families.
The three-week-long event attracted more than 175,000 visitors, a record for
Antwerp and a considerable boost to the local tourist industry. It took
place shortly after the 26th World Diamond Congress, whose principal message
was one of cautious optimism about the prospects for a revival for the
diamond trade in 1993/4.
In his keynote speech, Mr Julian Ogilvy-Thompson, chairman of De Beers
Centenary and De Beers Consolidated Mines, said that the diamond industry
had weathered a crisis which some outside commentators had predicted would
be terminal.
Prudent intervention by the Central Selling Organisation in London (CSO: the
body which regulates the distribution of rough diamonds) had helped to bring
supply and demand in the cutting centres more into balance. Confidence was
now returning to the trade, Mr Ogilvy-Thompson told delegates.
This view is reflected in the performance of the Belgian diamond market
which saw a strong expansion in the 1980s, followed by a period of
stabilisation between 1991-2. In the past six months, the market showed
signs of a revival.
The chief reasons for the improvement were a recovery in the US; a decline
in the supply of illegally mined diamonds from Angola (which continues to be
disrupted by the civil war); and preventive action by the CSO to deal with
dumping by Russian producers on key world markets.
The downside for the producers were tighter margins, cuts in production and
multiple lay-offs. In South Africa and Namibia, De Beers laid off 4000
people - about 25 per cent of its workforce.
The raw statistics tell a part of the story. Imports of diamonds rose from
65.6 per cent in weight to 87m carats. Measured by value, imports rose by 15
per cent to Dollars 4.4bn.
Exports showed the same degree of expansion, with volume increasing by 66
per cent to 66m carats. Exports by value rose by 14 per cent to Dollars
4.3bn, with an increase in polished diamond exports to the UK, Germany,
Italy, and France, despite the persistent weakness of the European economy.
As a result, the rise in turnover to 153.6m carats was markedly better than
the 92.6m achieved in the first of 1992; meanwhile, value increased
substantially from Dollars 7.6bn (1992) to Dollars 8.7bn. Of about 45m
carats of directly imported rough diamonds of gem quality, 25m - 56 per cent
 -come from the CSO in London.
Antwerp remains the world's most important distribution point for rough
diamonds, after the CSO.
It also boasts four of the world's 20 diamond bourses which together form
the Federation of Belgian Diamond Bourses: Diamantclub van Antwerpen (which
celebrated its centenary this year); Beurs voor Diamanathandel; Antwerpsche
Diamantkring; and the Vrije Diamanthandel.
Together, the total membership of the four bourses is nearly 6000, with more
than 1200 offices.
They have come a long way since the old polishing factories of the 1860s,
many of which were steam-driven. Today, electronic data processing has
transformed the operation of the diamond trade and industry, breaking down
distances and speeding up communications.
If there is a darker side to the new age, it is that Belgian's diamond
industry faces ever tougher competition, particularly from rival centres in
the Far East which can exploit lower wages and costs.
Smaller Belgian manufacturers are therefore pressing for regular supplies of
rough diamonds which are traded through Antwerp, while others are urging
younger members of the industry to come up with new technological
breakthroughs to improve competitiveness.
On the other hand, the Far East clearly offers enormous potential as a
consumer market, particularly in China.
Last February the Diamond High Council organised a visit to Asia which
included stops in the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong. Local traders in
Manila lobbied hard for deregulation of the industry in order to exploit its
potential as an important foreign exchange earner.
Mr Ogilvy-Thompson is cautiously optimistic about the future. But he warns:
'There will be no dramatic increase in business, until there is a resurgence
of world economic activity, and that, unfortunately, may still be up to a
year away.'
