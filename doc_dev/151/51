DE BEERS, the South African controlled diamond group, yesterday predicted a
'significant reduction' in the final dividend - only the second time in the
group's history that the dividend will have been cut.
De Beers also said it would take the very unusual step of introducing quotas
on diamond producers from September. The two moves together suggest that the
world diamond market is in a weaker state than many observers had believed.
The group's share price fell in Johannesburg yesterday, closing 6 per cent
lower at R68.50 (R73). The share has fallen 24 per cent in the last two
months.
Under the quotas, contractual obligations of the Central Selling
Organisation (CSO) - the De Beers organisation which markets about 80 per
cent of the world's rough diamond production - to take delivery of diamonds
will be cut by 25 per cent.
De Beers has followed a policy of not cutting its dividend, so predicting a
large reduction is a course it would rather have avoided.
De Beers said it had revised the diamond market's outlook because of lower
CSO sales. This partly resulted from weaker than expected economic
performances in its three main markets - the US, Japan and Europe - leading
to lower retail jewellery sales and lower rough diamond sales.
The market weakness was exacerbated by a 'dramatic increase' in the supply
of illicit diamonds from Angola, some of which were sold on to the market
outside of the CSO.
The group's interim figures for the six months to June were weak but in line
with market expectations. Combined attributable earnings of De Beers and
Centenary, its offshore arm, fell 26 per cent to Dollars 330m (Pounds 172m)
from Dollars 446m in 1991.
Although De Beers had predicted the second half would be better than in
1991, the board said yesterday that it might be worse. The group forecasts a
'greater percentage reduction' in the full year's profits than for the first
half.
Equity accounted earnings dropped to Dollars 460m from Dollars 586m in 1991.
The interim dividend remains at 25.1 US cents per linked De Beers/Centenary
unit.
