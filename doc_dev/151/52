FACED WITH a sharp fall in diamond sales, De Beers, the South African group
which controls more than 80 per cent of the rough (uncut) diamond market, is
lifting its promotional budget for the gems by 9 per cent this year to a
record Dollars 164m, the group's chairman, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson,
announced yesterday.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson also reported that De Beers' diamond sales were
improving, but he expected them to fall by 15 per cent in dollar terms
during the first half of 1992 compared with the same months last year.
This follows a 6 per cent fall last year, to Dollars 3.927bn.
Mr Jeremy Pudney, director of De Beers' Central Selling Organisation,
responsible for consumer promotion and advertising, said the increase in the
promotional budget - 5 per cent in real terms - would be aimed mainly at
Europe and south-east Asia.
The group will next month launch its biggest television advertising campaign
in Europe for diamonds. The number of people in Europe buying diamonds had
doubled in the past 10 years, but they were spending much less per head than
US buyers. 'We are trying to get a greater share of Europe's wealth,' Mr
Pudney said.
About Dollars 15m will be spent on the European television promotion, mainly
in the biggest markets: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.
A stroke of luck will enable the campaign to be launched in the UK on May 4
during a showing of the James Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever.
De Beers is also studying carefully the Chinese and Indian markets, where Mr
Pudney says there is a 'cultural affinity' for diamonds.
The group has been advertising in China for some years, and now believes
sales can be stimulated in the Guangdong region, close to Hong Kong.
One indication of the potential was that in the urban area, Guangzhon,
research showed that 98 per cent of households owned a television set.
At a briefing in London to coincide with the publication of De Beers' annual
report, Mr Ogilvie Thompson suggested that the diamond trade felt that the
present improvement in demand for polished stones would gather momentum.
'We expect sales for the second half of 1992 to be higher than the same
period last year. When the world economy resumes a reasonable rate of
growth, the diamond business can be confident of renewed prosperity,' Mr
Ogilvie Thompson said.
