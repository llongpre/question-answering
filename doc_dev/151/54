   LONDON -- Diamond sales by De Beers Centenary AG slid 6%
to $3.93 billion last year from $4.17 billion in 1990, mainly
because of the recession in the U.S. jewelry market, the
company said.
   The downturn accelerated in the fourth quarter, following
a muted revival earlier in the year, a De Beers official
said. As a result, second-half volume tumbled 11% to $1.84
million from $2.08 million in the first half, he said.

   Moreover, De Beers said, second-half sales were inflated
by $100 million because of delayed payments from Indian
dealers who had bought in the first half.
   In November, diamond buyers reported reduced orders of
gems from De Beers Centenary, a Swiss-based but South
African-owned corporation that controls 80% of the rough,
uncut diamond market.
   Diamond cutters and dealers were worried that U.S.
wholesalers and retailers, particularly Zale Corp., would buy
fewer diamonds. Zale, the largest retail jewelry chain in the
U.S., said last week that it was closing 400 stores and
halting payments to banks, bondholders and vendors.
   Early indications are that Christmas diamond jewelry
sales, which account for about 40% of annual purchases, were
down, the De Beers official said.
   Nevertheless, diamond stocks are low, the official said.
When the "consumer environment is in better shape," demand
for rough diamonds should increase, he added. Following a
sharp upturn in De Beers's diamond sales in the mid-1980s,
annual turnover has stagnated at around $4 billion for the
past four years.
