   Re Stansfield Turner's Oct. 18 editorial-page article "A Dangerous Concentration of Vital Minerals": He has been, as stated in the article, an adviser to Consolidated Gold Fields. 
An article published by him in the midst of a contested takeover supporting his erstwhile employer may be treated with the appropriate amount of caution. 
However, when an individual who also has occupied the position of director of the Central Intelligence Agency asserts that "during World War II the De Beers diamond-mining company that is part of the Oppenheimer empire refused to sell the U.S. a large quantity of industrial diamonds for war production," we feel that a response is called for. 

   Our records show that strenuous efforts were in fact made by De Beers to ensure the availability of war supplies. 
Notwithstanding the inevitable increase in demand, our prices were maintained at the levels that had applied during the pre-war period. 
Furthermore, sales of industrial diamonds during the war years were carried out through London under the supervision of the British government and it defies belief that the British government would have permitted a company under its jurisdiction to act in a manner that would have hampered war production in any way. 

   The insinuation by Mr. Turner that De Beers acted in such a way is not only totally unsubstantiated, but also deeply offensive to a family that was profoundly affected by the war. 
Barry Oppenheimer, who fought in North Africa with the South African Fourth Armoured Car Regiment, was one of a number of members of the family who saw active service on behalf of the Allies. 
The family also suffered the disappearance of relations who were living in Germany at the time. 

   As a former military officer, Adm. Turner should not seek advantage by impugning the wartime records of others. 
I wish to counterbalance the implication that people vitally involved in the defeat of Hitler would have taken commercial decisions that might have impeded this overriding objective.
