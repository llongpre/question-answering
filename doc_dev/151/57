De Beers, the South African group that controls more than 80 per cent of the
rough (uncut) diamond market, surprised analysts yesterday by reporting that
diamond sales this year by its London-based Central Selling Organisation
reached a record USDollars 4.366bn.
This was well ahead of most forecasts, 28 per cent up on last year's Dollars
3.417bn and 5 per cent above the previous record of Dollars 4.172bn in 1988.
De Beers warned, however, that there were some signs of over-supply in the
lower and cheaper quality range of rough diamonds following sales from
strategic stockpiles by the Russian and US governments.
There were also worrying sales of larger-sized, gem-quality diamonds from
Russia's treasury in the past two weeks which were in clear breach of the
republic's 1990 agreement with De Beers which gave the South African group
exclusive marketing rights to 95 per cent of Russia's rough diamond output.
Diamonds were set aside by the US and Russian strategic stockpiles for
industrial and technical use but the subsequent development of the Indian
industry, which can economically cut and polish very small stones, means
that today many of the stockpiled diamonds are cutable. For example, in two
tenders, the US stockpile not only sold 1.15m carats of industrial diamonds
for Dollars 6.5m but also 1.35m carats of small gem diamonds for Dollars
111.41m.
De Beers said retail diamond jewellery sales had held up well, given the
weakness of the global economy. If the Christmas selling season turned out
as expected, retail diamond jewellery sales this year would be marginally
higher than in 1992 when 55m pieces worth Dollars 41bn were sold.
There was strong retail sales growth this year in the US and east Asia (Hong
Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and China). Sales in Japan, which vies
with the US to be the biggest market, each accounting for about a third of
western world sales, were down in local currency terms but, because of the
yen's strength, up in dollars.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, part of the French
financial services group, said that even though diamond sales beat best
estimates it did not mean the market was particularly buoyant. De Beers had
been re-filling supply pipelines, he suggested, and consequently it would
have difficulty reaching Dollars 4bn of sales in 1994. Also De Beers'
attributable profit was unlikely to show as substantial an increase as its
diamond sales.
