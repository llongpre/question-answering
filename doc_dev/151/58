   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said its world-wide diamond sales surged 40% to $2.56 billion last year. 

   Sales soared because manufacturers, diamond dealers and retailers were replenishing stocks, said a spokesman for the Central Selling Organization, the South African company's marketing division here. 
The organization controls more than 80% of the world market for rough, unpolished diamonds. 

   Sales also were boosted by two price increases totaling an average of 14.5%, the spokesman said. 

   A sharp decline in the dollar and interest rates lowered the cost of diamonds in Japan and Europe. 
Japanese imports of polished diamonds jumped 59% in 1986, the spokesman said. 

   Sales improved in the past 18 months, dealers said, after being depressed for the first five years of the decade. 
The downturn was so severe that the Central Selling Organization supported the market by stockpiling gems, dealers said. 

   De Beers's sales rose to $1.34 billion in the 1986 second half from $1.21 billion a year earlier, and dealers expect sales to keep growing in 1987. 

   "The market was quiet in the past few weeks, but we expect another good year," said Jacques Zucker of Lacowsky-Zucker PvbA, diamond dealers in Antwerp, Belgium.
