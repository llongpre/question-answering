DE BEERS, the company that dominates diamond sales, yesterday gave a
cautiously upbeat view of the health of the industry, despite the weakness
of the world economy.
Speaking yesterday at the announcement of the company's annual results in
Johannesburg, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, the chairman, said: 'The Central
Selling Organisation (the De Beers controlled group that sells 80 per cent
of the world's rough diamonds) restricted its sales in the latter part of
1992 and the balance between rough supply and demand in the cutting centres
has been restored.'
Mr Ogilvie Thompson confirmed market talk that sales at the first two sights
 -the rough diamond auctions that take place ten times a year - had been
'very good', but put this down to exceptional factors - the scarcity of
diamonds from Angola, a hiatus in supply of Russian polished diamonds
following imposition of a 20 per cent export duty and high demand from
India.
Directors of De Beers also stressed yesterday that diamond jewellery sales
had held up very well in a recessionary climate. Mr Jeremy Pudney, a
director of the CSO, said the volume of jewellery pieces sold, and the
overall value of sales, had been very similar in 1992 to 1991. He said
sales, by value, had grown by about 4 per cent in the US, 9 per cent in
Germany and 6 per cent in France. Japanese sales fell by about 5 per cent in
dollar terms, with sales in Italy and the UK also slightly down.
Mr Gary Ralfe, a De Beers director, gave a positive account of relations
between De Beers and the Russian industry. He confirmed that Russia was
abiding by quota requirements, noting that its production had fallen by 25
per cent in 1992, with a further 15 per cent decline expected in 1993.
Mr Ralfe predicted a 'deluge' of Russian polished diamonds on to the market
if, as expected, the 20 per cent duty on diamond exports was lifted. He said
their stockpile was estimated at up to Dollars 1bn. He stressed, however,
that the Russians had not, in recent years, undermined prices in this market
as they had done with other commodities.
The sale of rough diamonds by Russia outside the CSO was a 'niggle' and not
something that could affect the general balance of the market.
