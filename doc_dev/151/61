diamond links

THE BELEAGUERED diamond market was cheered yesterday by news that De Beers,
the South African group that controls 80 per cent of world rough (uncut)
diamond trade, had signed an exclusive sales agreement with Yakutia, the
gold and diamond-rich area of eastern Siberia that is an autonomous republic
in the Russian Federation.
At the same time Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers director responsible for the
Russian business, revealed that, although output from the republic's
existing diamond mines seemed to be going smoothly, development of a huge
new mine in Yakutia, called Jubilee, was delayed by at least two years.
Shortages of construction materials such as steel and cement had caused the
set-back at Jubilee, which was originally scheduled to start up last autumn.
De Beers' Central Selling Organisation signed a Dollars 5bn, five-year sales
contract with the Soviet Union in 1990 and at the same time advanced a loan
of Dollars 1bn. Diamond stocks were moved from Moscow to London as
collateral.
Recently Russia took over the diamond deal but repayments had continued
without interruption, said Mr Ralfe. So far Dollars 250m had been repaid in
capital and interest via sales from the diamond stocks.
In December Yakutia, which produces nearly all of Russia's diamonds -
estimated by the Terraconsult consultancy organisation at 12m carats worth
Dollars 1.14bn in 1991 - secured the right from Russia to retain 10 per cent
of its output for independent sale.
De Beers has now won the right to sell this 10 per cent.
In Mr Ralfe's words: 'This is the same cat skinned in a different way. But
the diamond market will be reassured that we have established direct links
with Yakutia, one of the world's biggest diamond producers'.
