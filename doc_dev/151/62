   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's
largest diamond producer, said Tuesday its profits doubled last
year, but predicted a slowdown in world economic growth would cut
into 1989 sales.
   The year-end results showed that net attributable earnings
amounted to 2.090 billion rand, or $877 million, from 1.035 billion
rand a year earlier. De Beers chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson said
revenue rose strongly, helped by a 13.5 percent price increase in
May last year. He said there had been a slight slowdown in sales to
the Japanese market towards the end of the year, apparently due to
Emperor Hirohito's illness at the time.
   De Beers results follow the announcement earlier this year by the
group's marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, that sales
of rough gem and industrial diamonds by the organization totalled
$4.17 billion in 1988, up 35.7 percent from 1987's total of $3.08
billion.
