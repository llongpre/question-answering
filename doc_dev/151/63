   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said diamond sales for the first half of the year surged by 41% to $2.2 billion, the best ever for a six-month period. 

   The South African concern, controlling 80% of the diamond market, said diamond sales totaled $1.56 billion for the year-ago period. 
For all of 1987, diamond sales totaled $3.08 billion, the company said, up from $2.6 billion in 1986. 

   De Beers raised the price of rough uncut diamonds by 13.5% in early May. 
Prices for quality diamonds valued at $4,000 or more rose by as much as 20%, dealers said. 
The increases for smaller diamonds were also higher than the average. 

   Retail jewelers, manufacturers and dealers shrugged off the impact of last year's stock market crash and were enthusiastic buyers of large and small gems, said Andrew Lamont, a spokesman for the company. 

   But Mr. Lamont said that the market shouldn't become "euphoric." 
Diamond sales during the past few years have soared partly because of the weak dollar, Mr. Lamont said. 
Now that the dollar has appreciated, it is possible that growth in demand could slow, he said. 

   Last year, total sales of diamond jewelry rose to about 58 million pieces valued at $31 billion, up from about 52 million pieces valued at $28 billion in 1986, according to De Beers estimates.
