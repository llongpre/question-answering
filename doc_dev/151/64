De Beers of South Africa stepped back from a potentially serious conflict
yesterday by agreeing to consider changes to its Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn)
diamond marketing contract with Russia.
At the same time the Russian government representatives agreed 'to take
necessary steps' to stop rough (uncut) diamonds leaking from Russia through
unofficial channels to the west where they threatened to destabilise the
market.
Trade sources suggested that, after the Russians were publicly rebuked by De
Beers in December for breaking the contract, the flow of unofficial diamonds
eased but recently it had been increasing again.
There were sighs of relief in the diamond trade yesterday because Russia
supplies about 25 per cent of the diamonds De Beers sells through its
London-based Central Selling Organisation. The CSO controls more than 80 per
cent of the world's trade in rough diamonds.
In 1990 De Beers lent Russia Dollars 1bn, shipped some of the Russian
stockpile to London as collateral and signed the five-year marketing
agreement. This permits Russia to sell 5 per cent of its rough diamond
output directly to the west for 'market testing'.
While there are no indications that Russia wished to end the contract with
the world's most successful cartel, some officials have been pressing for
the federation to keep a bigger share. Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of
Komdragment, the Russian diamond and precious stones committee, who was in
the Russian negotiating team this week, is demanding that Russia be able to
keep 25 per cent of its rough diamond trade.
The De Beers team was headed by Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, its deputy chairman
and chairman of the CSO. According to diamond trade sources he stepped in at
the last moment because relationships had become strained.
Mr Gary Ralfe, who negotiated the Russian contract and publicly castigated
Russia for breaking it, was previously expected to head the De Beers team.
He was in Moscow with Mr Oppenheimer, however. Mr Richard Wake-Walker,
previously De Beers' representative in Moscow, quit the group recently after
being replaced by Mr Ray Clark. The Diamantaire trade newsletter suggested
Mr Wake-Walker 'advocated a flexible negotiating strategy with Russia while
Mr Ralfe and Mr Clark appear to be taking a tough, no-concessions approach'.
The large delegation with which Russia faced Mr Oppenheimer included
representatives from the Sakha diamond-producing region, as well as the
Russian diamond committee and the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Economic
Affairs - among whom the right approach is still being debated. Russia's
need for increased income from exports has been aggravated by the recent
fall in the oil price, its main export earner - and by the virtual
disappearance of its manufactured goods from the world market.
A joint communique yesterday said 'the parties remain committed to the
existing agreement, pending their agreeing on any modification. They are
also committed to the stability of the international diamond market and to
taking the necessary steps to curtail Russian rough gem diamonds reaching
the market outside the current marketing arrangements.'
