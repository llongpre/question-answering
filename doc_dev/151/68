    De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd., the world's largest diamond producer, reported net
income rose 38.6% in the first half of 1987 to 589 million
rand ($279.8 million) from 425 million rand a year earlier,
reflecting a 28.5% improvement in the group's world-wide
sales of diamonds.
   De Beers, which controls the supply and marketing of more than 80% of the world's diamonds through its London-based Central Selling Organization, said the organization's first-half sales totaled $1.56 billion, compared with $1.21 billion a year earlier. 
The company added "the indications are that sales will continue to be satisfactory in the second half of the year." 

   The company reported to shareholders that it bought one million shares, or 10%, of Anglo American Investment Trust Ltd., from Minerals &amp; Resources Corp. last month. 
Anglo American holds a 27.29% stake in De Beers, as well as interests in diamond trading companies.
