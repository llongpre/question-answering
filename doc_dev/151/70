DE BEERS, the South African-controlled company that dominates the world
diamond industry, is maintaining its dividend at 25.2 US cents a share
following improved earnings in the half-year to June.
Although the company continues to be very cautious about prospects for the
second half, the outlook is much better than a year ago when De Beers caused
a furore by announcing, unexpectedly, that a weak market would force a
substantial cut in the final dividend.
The balance sheet has also strengthened, showing an overall improvement of
Dollars 963m following a decline in borrowings and an improvement in net
current assets. The finances of De Beers were weakened in 1992 when it was
forced to spend large sums stabilising the open diamond market.
A year ago, at the time of the dividend warning, the company was suffering
from an unexpected economic weakening in leading markets and a glut of
illicit supply from Angola.
The diamond account was largely unchanged from the same period in 1992, with
income of Dollars 373m against Dollars 379m. An improvement in South African
operations, following increased production from the new Venetia mine and the
benefits of downsizing at the other mines, was offset by a weaker
performance from Centenary, which holds the non-South African assets -
mostly in Botswana and Namibia.
Weakness in the South African economy caused investment income from
interests outside the diamond industry to fall to Dollars 111m from Dollars
139m. Interest income also declined to Dollars 33m from Dollars 65m, leaving
pre-tax income 9 per cent lower at Dollars 444m against Dollars 473m.
A lower tax bill boosted attributable income which rose to Dollars 353m from
Dollars 325m in 1992. Earnings per share rose to 93 cents from 86 cents last
time.
Strong sales by the Central Selling Organisation, the marketing arm, of
Dollars 2.54bn in the first half of 1993, up from Dollars 1.79bn, helped
reduce diamond stocks by Dollars 527m to Dollars 3.24bn from Dollars 3.77bn
at the end of 1992. The balance sheet is thus likely to weaken again.
