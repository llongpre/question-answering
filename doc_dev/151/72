FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers prepares to boost
diamond supplies

DE BEERS, the South African group that controls about 80 per cent of the
world diamond market, yesterday responded to an improvement in the world
diamond market by increasing the amount it will buy from producers.
Last autumn the group, which organises the market through the London-based
Central Selling Organisation, told producers to cut agreed deliveries by 25
per cent as it struggled to bring supply and demand back into balance. Last
year its sales fell by 13 per cent from 1991 levels to Dollars 3.147bn - a
five-year low.
In February this year, however, De Beers was able to increase its prices by
an average of 1.5 per cent - the first rise for nearly three years.
Yesterday the group said that 'in line with the changing relationship
between anticipated CSO sales for 1993 and potential supply, the 75 per cent
quota entitlement will be increased to 80 per cent with effect from May 1'.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, the group's chairman, said that while the
increase was not large, it showed the market was better than when the quota
was imposed last August. He said the first three 'sights', as its sales are
known, were 'very good'. The next is due next week.
The improved market is put down to reduced smuggling from Angola because of
the rainy season and the resumption of the civil war; slow sales from
Russia, particularly before it lifted the 20 per cent export duty; and
buoyant demand from India, which had increased sales to the US. Retail
signals were mixed, said Mr Ogilvie Thompson, but it was encouraging that
diamond jewellery sales had held up despite the recession.
