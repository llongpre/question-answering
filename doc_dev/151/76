DIAMOND SALES by De Beers of South Africa, which controls 80 per cent of the
world's rough diamond trade, last year fell by 13 per cent to Dollars
3.417bn.
However, De Beers indicated yesterday that its grip on the market was as
tight as ever and that it had achieved its objective of balancing the supply
of rough, or uncut, diamonds with demand. It said rough diamond prices were
'firm', stocks at cutting centres were at 'reasonable levels', as were
traders' bank borrowings.
The diamond sales figures, announced by De Beers' London-based Central
Selling Organisation, were at the top end of analysts' expectations and
this, coupled with the group's estimate that world retail jewellery sales
last year would match the Dollars 39bn-Dollars 40bn in 1991, helped move the
share price up by Pounds  13/32 to Pounds 8 1/16 .
The CSO operates a buffer stock of rough diamonds to keep the market on an
even keel. It not only had to cope with recession in the US and Japan, but
also had to mop up an estimated Dollars 500m-worth of gemstones smuggled out
of Angola last year. This problem ended when the threat of civil war was
renewed in that country, the CSO reported.
De Beers passed on some of the financial pain to producers by cutting their
supply quotas by 25 per cent from September onwards. Nevertheless, analysts
suggested De Beers' finances took a hefty knock defending the diamond market
last year.
Mr Steve Oke, analyst at the Smith New Court financial services group, said
it was likely De Beers' earnings would fall by 30 per cent from the 1991
level and that the dividend would be cut by half.
