<P>
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's biggest diamond producer, 
announced today that it will raise prices for uncut stones by 5.5% next Monday 
to cash in on strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
The South African mining firm controls about 80% of world trade in rough, or 
uncut, diamonds through its London-based Central Selling Organization. 
</P>
<P>
It noted exports were running at record levels, particularly from manufacturing 
centers like Israel and India, for polished stones of up to 1 carat in weight. 
</P>
<P>
"The market shows strong, sustained and sustainable demand," a De Beers 
spokesman said. "It's not a flash in the pan." 
</P>
<P>
This had led to premiums being charged on stones of up to 1 carat sold in the 
open market outside CSO control, which influenced the organization's decision 
to raise its prices.
