   In another challenge to Minorco S.A.'s takeover bid, Consolidated Gold Fields PLC said it brought an antitrust suit last night in federal court in New York. 

   The lawsuit is the latest move in a campaign to fight the #2.05 billion ($3.52 billion) bid from Minorco, which has ties to a huge South African industrial empire. 
Minorco seeks the 70.6% of the British mining company it doesn't already own. 

   Consolidated has asked Britain, the U.S., South Africa and Australia to block the bid for anti-competitive or national-interest reasons; officials said it plans to file a formal complaint with the European Community Commission within days. 

   Yesterday, Consolidated Chairman Rudolph Agnew claimed the bid could have dire political consequences, suggesting the South African government might try to exploit what he called Minorco's domination over strategic minerals and metals. 
He also argued the bid may prompt Western governments to widen their sanctions against all South African-controlled companies because of that country's apartheid policies. 

   In a move that could mute some U.S. opposition, the gold giant said Monday that it would sell Consolidated's entire 49.7% stake in Newmont Mining Corp., if its bid succeeds. 
Minorco also has said the merged company would sell Consolidated's 38% stake in Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd., a mining company. 

   Analysts believe Minorco could mollify critics further by agreeing to sell Consolidated's 49% stake in Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd., an Australian mining company. 
Renison produces several strategic minerals, such as rutile and zircon, used in U.S. military aircraft and nuclear submarines. 
On Monday, Papua New Guinea said Renison would have to sell its gold holdings there if South African interests acquired Consolidated. 

   Minorco is a Luxembourg-based company. 
It is 60.1%-owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold-and diamond-mining interests controlled by South Africa's Oppenheimer family. 
Shares issued under the bid would reduce the total holding of De Beers and Anglo American in Minorco to about 40.9%. 

   Consolidated has claimed that if the bid succeeds, Oppenheimer-controlled companies would account for 32% of gold production in non-communist countries, up from 20% currently. 
Consolidated also has said that an Oppenheimer-controlled company currently accounts for more than half of Western platinum production. 

   Consolidated and Newmont Mining together filed the U.S. suit against Minorco, De Beers and Anglo American, accusing them of violating U.S. antitrust and securities laws. 
A Consolidated spokesman said the litigation alleges the bid threatens to create a monopoly in the gold market, as the defendants "have already achieved in the diamond market." 
The suit also charges that Minorco's bid was misleading by claiming Minorco would become "independent" as a result. 
A Minorco spokesman declined to comment on yesterday's developments.
