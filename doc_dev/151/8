<TEXT>     De Beers unveiled the heart-shaped jewel in London on Wednesday, with a lot
of security and a touch of drama.;    The room was darkened, then a curtain
opened. A spotlight lighted up an egg-sized diamond, sparkling on a rotating
stand and reflecting colored light around the room.;    "A truly rare and
unique diamond," said Nicky Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of his family's
diamond-mining empire, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.;    The gem is unique
and thus impossible to value, he said, though De Beers has insured it for at
least $100 million.;    There are only two larger diamonds in the world, and
Queen Elizabeth II owns them.;    The largest is the 530.2-carat Great Star of
Africa in the imperial scepter, and the 317.4-carat Lesser Star of Africa in
the imperial crown. They are kept in the Tower of London, and their value is
not known.;    Both were cut 86 years ago from one gem, the Cullinan diamond
that was 3,106 carat rough. Like the Centenary, it was found in De Beers'
Premier mine in South Africa.;    The Cullinan diamond was cut before the
"brilliant" cut was fully developed in the 1920s. This involves cutting facets
to reflect the most possible light.;    The Centenary was found in the
mid-1980s through the normal mechanized mining process in the mine,
Oppenheimer said.;    The rough Centenary diamond, which weighed 599 carats,
was unveiled at the company's centenary celebrations in South Africa in 1988.;
   It then took three years to prepare, cut and polish the jewel, Oppenheimer
said. The Centenary diamond is more than twice the size of the next largest
comparable stone, the company said.;    Gabi Tolkowsky, whose great-uncle
developed the modern cutting methods, cut the Centenary diamond in a cellar in
Johannesburg.;    The Centenary was a difficult stone to cut and polish
because its shape did not suggest an obvious approach for yielding the jewel
locked within, the company said. In its rough form, the diamond resembled an
irregular matchbox.;    "Every day I was looking at it, but at night, it was
looking at me," Tolkowsky joked.;    Finally, he said, it "talked to me and
said, 'This is the shape I want.' ";    De Beers intends to exhibit the
diamond around the world, Oppenheimer said.  </TEXT>
