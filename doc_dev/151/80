   DE BEERS CONSOLIDATED MINES LTD. of South Africa, the world's largest producer of diamonds, said net income rose 30% last year, to 1.50 billion rand ($701.1 million) from 1.15 billion rand in 1986. 

   Profit after tax but excluding De Beers's share of earnings from associate companies rose 36%, to 1.04 billion rand from 762 million rand. 

   The earnings report followed the announcement earlier this year by the Central Selling Organization, De Beers's marketing arm, that its sales of rough-gem and industrial diamonds rose 20% last year, to $3.08 billion from $2.56 billion.
