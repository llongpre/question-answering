FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers' diamond sales up by
42% in first half

DIAMOND SALES by De Beers, the South African group which dominates the
market, reached an unprecedented Dollars 2.543bn in the first half of this
year, 42 per cent above the depressed total for the first six months of
1992.
But the company cited several special factors which helped to boost sales
and were 'likely to prove transitory' and warned that 'it would be unwise to
look upon the increased level of sales for the first half as a reliable
guide to 1993 as a whole'.
Nevertheless, analysts suggested that even an average second-half
performance would send De Beers' rough (uncut) diamond sales above the
record Dollars 4.17bn seen in 1988 and 1990.
'De Beers' market share must be as close to 100 per cent as it is ever
likely to get,' said Mr Steve Oke, analyst at the Smith New Court financial
services group.
De Beers responded to the improvement by increasing its purchases from
producers who belong to the cartel organised by its London-based Central
Selling Organisation. In September the CSO told producers to cut deliveries
by 25 per cent as it struggled to bring rough diamond supply and demand back
into balance following a huge surge in unofficial exports from Angola.
These 'producer delivery entitlements' were raised to 80 per cent in May and
yesterday went to 85 per cent. In February the CSO made its first price
increase for three years, averaging a modest 1.5 per cent and concentrating
mainly on stones above three quarters of a carat in size. De Beers said the
transitory elements in its first-half figures included:
A relative lack of uncut stones from Angola and Zaire, both affected by
severe political disruption;
A shortage of Russian polished diamonds in the first quarter (which analysts
suggested was caused by bureaucratic bungling);
Buoyant demand from India caused both by various budgetary incentives -
including the increased convertibility of the Indian currency - and a rise
in exports to the US.
Restocking in the cutting centres and some consumer markets, particularly
the US, the most important market for gem diamonds, where Christmas sales
were up substantially both in volume and value terms.
De Beers said there had been some recent increase in diamonds from Angola,
Zaire and Russia. The US government had sold Dollars 77m worth of rough
stones from its strategic stockpile and planned more sales later this year.
The present market for polished diamonds was not as strong as that for rough
stones and no dramatic improvement in retail sales could be expected until
there was a resurgence of world economic activity, it added.
Mr Oke at Smith New Court suggested a great deal of De Beers' extra
first-half sales came from re-stocking rather than any substantial
improvement in retail diamond sales. 'The stones are in the pipeline. But if
there is no retail action to suck them through, wholesalers will sit tight
and buy no more. But even an average second-half sale of Dollars 1.7bn would
take 1993 sales to Dollars 4.2bn or Dollars 4.3bn - a significant
improvement on recent years.'
Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst at the SG Warburg financial services group, said
the figures pointed to a 'welcome reduction in De Beers' diamond stockpile'.
The group might be able to restore the recent dividend cut as well as soon
restore the offtake from producers' to 100 per cent, he added.
The figures were only slightly ahead of many analysts' expectations and De
Beers share price, which had risen by Dollars 1.50 this week in anticipation
of the announcement, was unchanged yesterday at Dollars 18.10.
