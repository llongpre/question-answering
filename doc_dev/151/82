minefield - Philip Gawith previews the South African diamond group's 1992
results out today

WHEN the board of De Beers, the South African group which dominates the
world diamond market, gathers in Kimberley today to consider the 1992
financial results and dividend, it will be the focus of unprecedented
attention.
A terse announcement seven months ago - 'The directors advise that the
current outlook indicates a significant reduction in the final dividends' -
sent the De Beers share price and Johannesburg Stock Exchange into a
tailspin. It also unleashed an avalanche of unfavourable publicity on the
company.
At the time, the air was thick with accusations that De Beers was either
misreading or misleading the market. Many analysts were left with egg on
their faces and investors with heavy losses.
Since then, sentiment towards the company has improved, but it remains very
skittish. De Beers' shares, for example, plunged nearly 7 per cent on
Wednesday last week to R62.75, before recovering slightly.
The key question today is by how much De Beers will cut the dividend -
something it has done only once before. Most analysts are forecasting a cut
of between 30 and 40 per cent, from 112 US cents a share in 1991. But some
forecasters estimate the cut could be as high as 50 per cent.
Apart from De Beers' August dividend announcement, which effectively compels
it to cut the dividend, a reduction is a financial necessity. Dividend cover
has fallen over the past four years to a level where there is very little
leeway to hold the dividend if earnings fall - as they are sure to do.
Investors and brokers will also anxiously scrutinise De Beers's balance
sheet to ascertain how much it has spent mopping up the excess diamond
supply that had bypassed the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), the De
Beers controlled company that sells 80 per cent of the world's rough
diamonds.
At the same time as the dividend announcement, De Beers imposed quotas which
reduced the amount of diamonds the CSO would buy from producers by 25 per
cent. This wrong-footed most brokers, and there is now considerable
nervousness about what De Beers will decide to do next.
This partly reflects the high risk of forecasting errors. The secrecy and
complexity of the industry mean analysts are dealing with imperfect
information. But it is also a function of confusing market signals.
Despite the US recovery, the weak state of other world economies, especially
Japan's, ought to be bad news for the sale of luxury items like diamonds.
News, however, from 1993's first two rough diamond auctions - known as
'sights' - tells a different tale. Trade estimates suggest the two sights
were worth a total of about Dollars 850m, nearly 50 per cent more than the
estimated Dollars 580m for the comparable auctions in 1992.
Analysts resolve this anomaly by arguing that the pick-up in sales is
artificial. De Beers, they say, last year limited supply so much that it
caused a shortage which led to a firming of prices and larger sights. Higher
sales, however, do not reflect the underlying reality that production far
outstrips demand.
One possibility is that the good sights, together with the CSO's recent 1.5
per cent rise in the prices it pays for rough diamonds, show that De Beers
is trying to soften the blow of lower earnings. Whatever the outlook for CSO
sales in 1993 - most analysts seem to think they will rise marginally to
Dollars 3.6bn from Dollars 3.4bn in 1992 - the improved state of rough
diamond sights will have no bearing on De Beers results to be announced
today.
These will certainly show a considerable fall in earnings, in large part due
to its decision, effective from September, to impose quotas on producers.
This obviously affects all De Beers's own mines - in South Africa, Namibia
and Botswana. Analysts are predicting that earnings per share, including
retained profits from associates, will fall by 20 to 30 per cent from 283 US
cents in 1991.
There is little prospect of the CSO quotas being scrapped, since the gap
between production contracted to the company, probably about Dollars 5bn,
and actual CSO sales, remains considerable.
There is broad agreement among analysts that by imposing quotas, by mopping
up rough stones outside the CSO and by keeping sights tight, De Beers has
done a good job in performing its traditional role of maintaining order in
the market.
Mr Kevin Kartun, analyst at stockbroker Frankel Pollak Vinderine, notes:
'Once more the De Beers/CSO arrangement has restored stability . . . I don't
think anyone else could have done it.'
Mr Des Kilalea, analyst at broker Martin &amp; Co, endorses this view. 'I think
they've done their job. The doomsday scenarios one was hearing about are a
lot more distant now.' He adds, however, that De Beers is not yet out of the
woods.
Two problems held back De Beers last year: weaker-than-anticipated demand,
as world economies failed to pick up; and increased supply as a flood of
diamonds emerged from Angola. On the first count, the pick-up in the US
economy is not sufficient to offset the anaemic performance of Europe and
the increasingly fragile Japanese economy.
And, while floods and renewed hostilities in Angola have dampened supplies
that from country, Mr Kilalea comments: 'It is not a problem that has been
cured. It is one that has been shelved.'
