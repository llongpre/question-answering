FT  19 AUG 93 / People: De Beers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is turning out to be a year to remember for Chips Keswick, chairman of
Hambros Bank. Knighted in the New Year, he then joined the illustrious group
who are directors of the Bank of England - and now has topped all that by
becoming a director of De Beers, the South African group which dominates the
world diamond business.
As a regular visitor to South Africa, Sir Chips is well-known to the
business community there and, more important, is well-known to Julian
Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of both De Beers and its sister organisation, the
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa. Rupert Hambro, a former chairman
of Hambros Bank, has been a non-executive director of Anglo for more than
ten years.
The connections between Hambros, De Beers and the diamond market go back
many more years. The UK merchant bank is reputed to have provided a vital
link between De Beers and the former Soviet Union in the days when
international politics decreed there should be no formal relationship
between them. According to trade sources, Hambros bought most of the Soviet
rough (uncut) diamonds and made sure that most ended up safely with De
Beers' cartel, which controls about 80 per cent of the market. After the
collapse of the Soviet Union, there was no longer any need for this ruse and
Russia quickly joined the cartel.
