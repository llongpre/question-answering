   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC asked the British government to review Minorco S.A.'s hostile takeover bid, citing potential problems stemming from Minorco's South African connections. 

   London-based Consolidated Gold warned the government Friday of "severe damage" to its operations if the #2.05 billion ($3.48 billion) bid from Minorco, which has ties to a huge South African industrial empire, succeeds. 
In a report to Britain's Office of Fair Trading, Consolidated Gold cited the "reluctance" of many customers and suppliers to deal "with South African-controlled companies," and cautioned against South African domination over strategic minerals and metals. 

   The admonitions widen Consolidated Gold's defense strategy against Minorco, which is bidding for the 70.6% of Consolidated Gold it doesn't already own. 
Consolidated Gold also claims that the offer sharply undervalues the company. 

   Minorco is a Luxembourg-based company, 60.1%-owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold- and diamond-mining interests of South Africa's influential Oppenheimer family. 
Shares issued under the bid would reduce the total holding of De Beers and Anglo American in Minorco to about 40.9%. 
Consolidated Gold has its own South African ties, with a 38% stake in Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd., a mining company. 

   Under British law, the government can block takeover bids if it decides they threaten competition or the national interest. 
But defining "national interest" has been an extremely sensitive issue this year, culminating in the Thatcher government's order last week for Kuwait to cut its stake in British Petroleum Co. by more than half, to 9.9%. 

   That decision was sharply criticized as a violation of Thatcherite commitments to the free market. 
It isn't clear whether the government would consider South African control of Consolidated Gold a threat to Britain's national interest. 

   Besides offering a second possible means of blocking Minorco's bid, appealing to the British government could help Consolidated Gold in another way. 
If the government eventually blocks Minorco's bid, Minorco might decide against holding on to its 29.4% stake. 
De Beers and Anglo American acquired the initial stake in Consolidated Gold in 1980, and since then the British company has made great efforts to stress its distance from the Oppenheimers. 

   Meanwhile, South Africa's Competition Board announced it would study whether Minorco's bid would give De Beers and Anglo American a controlling interest in Gold Fields of South Africa, the Consolidated Gold spokesman said. 
Minorco has said the merged company would sell the South African mining operations.
