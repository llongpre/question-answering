   LONDON -- Weakening economies, particularly in the U.S.,
sent diamond sales tumbling in the second half of 1990.
   Diamond sales of De Beers Centenary AG slowed to $1.69
billion in the second half of 1990 from $2.48 billion in the
first six months, the company said.

   Turnover declined mainly because of the weak U.S. diamond
jewelry market, which prompted price cutting, said De Beers,
a South African owned corporation which controls 80% of the
world market in rough, uncut diamonds.
   Total 1990 sales of $4.17 billion, however, were slightly
higher than 1989's $4.09 billion mainly because "strong"
demand in the first four months of the year and a 5.5% price
increase last March, De Beers said.
   Early indications of Christmas sales, which account for
about a third of annual diamond jewelry turnover, "were
mixed," said Michael Grantham, a director of the Central
Selling Organisation, the international marketing division of
De Beers.
   Christmas sales in Texas and Western U.S. states were
satisfactory, he said, but were down in New York, Detroit and
other Eastern and Midwestern states.
   It is too soon to assess the impact of the 10% U.S. luxury
sales tax on jewelry items of $10,000 or more, Mr. Grantham
said. But dealers said they think diamond jewelry sales could
dip in the first quarter because the tax takes effect during
a recession.
   The depressed dollar helped boost sales in Italy and
Germany, Mr. Grantham said. Diamond jewelry sales were higher
in Japan, the second largest market after the U.S., partly
because the surge in the yen lowered the cost of imports. But
Japanese trade also slowed toward the end of the year, Mr.
Grantham said.
   "We are cautious about the market's prospects in the
coming year, because of the Gulf crisis and slowdown in the
world economy," Mr. Grantham said. Yet De Beers is spending
$150 million on diamond promotion in 1991 and will partly
subsidize a $30 million industry advertising campaign, he
said.
   The sharp decline in second half sales wasn't unexpected,
dealers said.
   De Beers began allocating fewer diamonds to dealers last
September to support the weak market. As a result the
company's sales of diamonds to the dealers and manufacturers
were bound to decline, dealers said.
   Diamonds that were withheld from the market were mainly
the lower-priced assortments supplied to Bombay dealers, the
main suppliers of the cheap end of the U.S. diamond jewelry
market, Mr. Grantham said.
   The Bombay diamond industry underwent hard times in the
past 12 months following heady over-expansion during the
1980s, he said.
