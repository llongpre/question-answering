De Beers Raises Diamond Prices: The marketing arm of South Africa's De Beers 
Consolidated Mines, the Central Selling Organization, said it was raising its 
prices for rough gem diamonds by an average of 15.5%. The group, which sells 
the vast majority of the world's diamonds, said the increase reflects strong 
market conditions. The price increase, the fifth in three years, takes effect 
at the CSO's next sale, known as a "sight," on March 28. De Beers spokesman 
Andy Lamont said the market was helped by good demand from Japan, the 
second-largest retail diamond market after the United States.
