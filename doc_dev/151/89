   The stock market crash hasn't deterred the rich and famous from bidding for expensive diamonds and precious stones at auctions and shops. 

   But despite booming sales of these high-priced gems, wholesale dealers and other middlemen are decidedly cautious. 
They worry that last month's crash and subsequent concerns about the economy could curb purchases by the newly wealthy and other lesser mortals of medium to lower quality gems, which account for the bulk of diamond sales. 

   Dealer purchases have already slowed. 
Orders by leading dealers at a sale this month by De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. were below expectations, traders say. 
De Beers, a South African concern, controls about 80% of the uncut diamond market. 
"We are worried that retailers will buy fewer diamonds in the coming months," one dealer says. 

   Prices also are showing signs of weakening. 
"Prior to the stock market crash, the market was so buoyant that rough, uncut diamonds were trading at a premium of around 10% over De Beers quotes," says Jacques Zucker, a director of LachowskyZucker PVBA, a diamond dealer in Antwerp, Belgium. 
But since the crash, that premium has vanished. 

   Says Adrian Klein, a director of A. Freeman (Precious Stones) Ltd. in London: "Prices of rubies, emeralds and sapphires rose in a firm market this year, but in the past few weeks trade is quieter." 

   Retailers, particularly in New York, are eagerly waiting for Christmas, Mr. Klein says. 
"Around 40% of the world's diamond jewelry sales are in the U.S., and the bulk takes place ahead of Christmas," explains a De Beers spokesman. 

   Meanwhile, the market for top quality gems has remained relatively steady despite overall uncertainty, analysts say, partly because prices are still much lower than their peaks at the beginning of the decade, and partly because of a shortage of quality gems. 

   Prices of top quality diamonds, which slumped to a low of around $9,000 a carat in 1985 from average prices of $55,000 in 1980, are now trading around $14,500 a carat. 
A carat equals 1/142 of an ounce. 

   Jewelry auction sales are booming only weeks after the stock market crash, however. 
A 64.8 carat diamond sold for a record $6.4 million in New York Oct. 22, and an auction by Christies International Geneva S.A. earlier this month took in $22 million, compared with $14 million from an auction last spring. 
Three other auction houses, including Sotheby's, sold jewelry totaling $18 million in Geneva this month. 

   The latest sale was the best since 1980, Christies says. 
Several top quality diamond items sold at prices ranging from $700,000 to $2.2 million, while a 24-carat sapphire went for just under $1 million. 

   The demand for top-notch diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires partly reflects a flight to quality assets, says Hans Nadelhoffer, managing director of Christies in Geneva. 
There's "undoubtedly considerable interest in high quality investment gems," he says. 
But sales of medium to lower-priced goods didn't fare as well, he adds. 

   Some firms are even having difficulty keeping up with the demand. 
Mark Evans, a director of Bentley &amp; Co. jewelers in London, placed several advertisements saying that the firm was "keener than ever to purchase items of jewelry" because its "stock of old diamonds and precious gems is rapidly becoming depleted." 

   "We were amazed by the response," Mr. Evans says. 
"In the past few weeks purchases and sales have doubled." 

   Clients rarely disclose motives for their transactions, Mr. Evans says. 
Sellers more than likely need the cash, he says. 
Those buyers who aren't seeking investments could be simply consoling themselves after the crash, he adds. 

   Or they could be those who view stock-price fluctuations with merely a passing interest, since they don't affect their purchasing power. 
A spokesman for Garrard &amp; Co., whose customers include the British royal family, says sales maintained a steady pace -- before and after the market's crash.
