FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (17): Shaky, erratic recovery - The diamond
industry

THESE are critical and exciting times for Angola's diamond industry as it
rides a switchback which has seen production peak at 2.3m carats in 1974 and
slump to 714,000 in 1985.
A somewhat shaky and erratic recovery will be sustained, say officials from
Endiama, the state-owned company, and the government's department of geology
and mining. Mr Jose Dias, the department's secretary of state anticipates
that production will rise to nearly 1.4m carats next year.
The officials believe that foreign investors will respond to improved fiscal
terms and a new mining law, introduced earlier this year, which allows
private companies a greater role in the sector.
The sector's growth in the medium to long term lies in the development of
the country's rich kimberlite potential. Most of Angola's diamonds are
currently mined from alluvial operations in Lunda Norte, chiefly the Cuango
division.
At a development cost of some Dollars 1bn, several kimberlite pipes already
identified in Cuango might yield production of an estimated 3m-4m carats a
year.
The recovery from the mid-80s slump began in 1986 when the state operator,
Diamang - which had a monopoly on official production - was dissolved and
Endiama was established to reorganise the sector.
Endiama, still the sole concessionaire, sought to encourage foreign
investors back into the sector. Following the peace agreement last year, its
policy is beginning to bear fruit.
After a five-year break, Endiama early last year returned Angola's diamonds
to the international fold when it agreed with De Beers Centenary, the
Swiss-based mining and marketing organisation, to sell all its Cuango
production through the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), which purchases,
values and sells nearly 80 per cent of the world's rough diamond production.
The agreement with De Beers also included a Dollars 50m loan to further
develop the production from the Cuango region. The loan has now been fully
drawn down to finance a seven-year contract with Odebrecht, a Brazilian
company, to explore and mine diamond reserves in the Cuango.
The project, brainchild of Mr Noe Baltazer, Endiama's managing director, is
the most ambitious embarked on by the company. It includes the construction
of a high-tech, self-sufficient operational headquarters at the remote site
of Luzamba in the Cuango region.
'The Luzamba project is now the centre of gravity of our operation. Most
importantly, it involves setting up a huge exploration programme in this
area,' says Mr Baltazer.
RST International, a subsidiary of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines,
originally signed an agreement with Endiama to mine diamonds around Cafunfo
at the end of 1986 (a year which had seen organised operations almost grind
to a halt in the Lunda Norte) and remains in operation, its contract renewed
annually.
The alluvial operations in Lunda Norte remain particularly threatened by
illicit digging and selling. Industry officials estimate that illegal sales
of high quality gems could be costing the country as much as Dollars 5m a
week. Diamond exports earned Angola Dollars 190m last year, down from
Dollars 242m in 1990.
Angola, the seventh-largest diamond producer in the world in volume, is
capable of 'making it into the first league', according to an industry
official. However, according to western experts, the explosion in illegal
sales poses a threat to the industry and to Endiama. De Beers, for its part,
has had to buy stones on the open market at market rates in an attempt to
stabilise supply.
A rise in illegal mining, particularly in the Cuango region which produces
80 per cent of Angola's diamonds and some of its highest quality gems,
partly explains the rise in illicit sales. Cuango sites have been flooded by
thousands of diggers since the peace accord last May which allowed freedom
of movement for the first time in 16 years.
Illicit trading was further fuelled, western analysts believe, by a law
introduced at the end of last year, now under review, which gave individuals
the right to own and sell diamonds.
However, these factors do not fully explain the increase. 'We could be
looking at 13,000 carats a week. That would involve a lot of digging,' says
one industry official.
In the murky world of illicit diamond dealing, rumours abound while proof
remains elusive. Popular theories include Unita releasing its stockpiles
following the peace agreement, to Endiama complicity.
These problems will be resolved, officials believe, by a restructuring of
the industry. Legislation introduced at the beginning of this year paves the
way for an end to the state's monopoly of the mining sector. The law
envisages that both foreign and local private companies can invest in
prospecting and mining.
The law covers prospecting and research, exploration and exploitation, and
taxation. Mr Dias says private, mixed or state companies can work alongside
each other, with state enterprises no longer taking precedence.
'We arrived at the conclusion that state enterprises were fully concerned
with administration - and were bad administrators,' he said.
However, the reforms may fall short of investor expectations, for mining
rights have not been made transferable and saleable, and the government
still decides who is competent to operate.
Investor confidence has nevertheless been boosted by the news that De Beers
and Endiama, are due shortly to sign an agreement which both sides say will
set precedents for future deals in the mining sector.
The agreement involves De Beers investing Dollars 50m on evaluation of known
kimberlite deposits and prospecting for new primary deposits in Angola.
The flexible fiscal regime being negotiated as part of the deal is expected
to set precedents which will prove attractive to foreign companies, not just
mining houses.
