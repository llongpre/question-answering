FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price rise for rough diamonds

ROUGH DIAMOND prices are going up for the first time in nearly three years.
De Beers, the South African group that controls about 80 per cent of the
rough (uncut) diamond market, announced yesterday that it would be changing
its prices and assortments from next Monday to produce an overall increase
of 1.5 per cent.
Analysts suggest that this is another sign that De Beers has regained
control over the market after a year when its grip seemed threatened by deep
recession in many industrialised countries and an upsurge in smuggling out
of Angola.
Last autumn the group told producers to cut agreed deliveries by 25 per cent
as it struggled to bring supply and demand back into balance.
De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation said yesterday demand
for particular categories of rough stones had recently been strong. 'We
think this will be sustained and the market can absorb the price increase
relatively easily.'
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnaise Laing, suggested: 'The
crisis has passed for the diamond market for the moment. De Beers obviously
thinks the market has turned for the better'.
