on diamond sales

De Beers, the South African group whose London-based Central Selling
Organisation accounts for at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough
diamonds, gave a clear hint yesterday that it might have given the market
indigestion while chalking up record first-half sales of USDollars 2.58bn.
It described the performance - 1.5 per cent higher than in the same months
last year - as 'encouraging' but said it cut supplies to the market in the
second quarter because of 'a build-up of stocks in the (diamond) cutting
centres and continued concerns in respect of cutting-centre profitability'.
'There was good demand for some of the larger sizes but evidence of
over-production in certain categories of small stones. So sights (sales)
were reined in in the second quarter.'
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'There is no
question that demand for diamonds is recovering. But De Beers has been
pushing the market too hard. From all parts of the trade we hear complaints
about there being too many diamonds and too many diamonds of the wrong sort.
There are not enough stones from which the trade can make a profit.'
Like some other analysts, he suggested that De Beers would continue to
restrict supplies so that its second half sales would be well below those in
the first six months. The 1994 full-year total therefore would be not much
different from last year's Dollars 4.366bn. De Beers' profits from diamonds
would remain low, he added, and its total earnings would consequently 'not
be that buoyant'.
De Beers yesterday acknowledged that its big customers, who cut and polish
gem diamonds, were complaining that their profit margins had been squeezed
so hard during the past two years that they were now practically
non-existent. The CSO is to meet a delegation to discuss these problems.
A spokesman pointed out that the long recession had also been painful for De
Beers, which had cut production, made 25 per cent of employees at its
diamond mines redundant, cut the dividend to shareholders and was having to
finance stocks that had risen to Dollars 4bn. The international promotional
budget had also been lifted from Dollars 150m to more than Dollars 170m.
The group increased rough diamond prices by 1.5 per cent in February last
year, the first rise since 1990. Producers were also asked to cut deliveries
from previously-agreed levels and De Beers made it clear yesterday that
deliveries would remain unchanged at 85 per cent.
De Beers said that in the first half demand for retail diamond jewellery
remained stable in the US but was weak in Japan, which vies with the States
as the biggest diamond retail market. Demand in other east Asian markets was
high but it was weak in Europe. There were signs, however, that the
economies of both Japan and Europe had 'bottomed out'.
