diamond deal

RUSSIA will press for an improvement in the terms of a five-year deal giving
South Africa's De Beers a virtual monopoly on the country's sales of rough
diamonds, if an influential Russian parliamentarian gets his way.
Mr Leonid Gurevich, who co-chairs a state commission examining the Russian
diamond industry, has complained that the agreement signed in 1990 by Soviet
authorities is 'not a partnership'. He said that other diamond-producing
countries such as Australia had obtained much better terms from De Beers,
which controls 80 per cent of the rough (uncut) diamond market through its
London-based Central Selling Organisation.
Mr Gurevich also rejected what he called 'blackmail' by De Beers, which
suggested that Russian complaints would only damage Russian interests by
further weakening an already depressed diamond market.
He said that at a meeting requested by De Beers on Thursday evening he had
challenged Mr Gary Ralfe, the head of the CSO, who is also in charge of
relations with Russia, to prove that the relationship was fair.
'I said 'help me' (prove this). He answered with an attack. He said they are
thinking about whether to renew the present agreement. . . I told him he was
strongly exaggerating the losses we would face if the relationship broke
down. I explained to him that it would be a catastrophe for De Beers but not
for Russia.' Mr Gurevich also said he had received from Mr Ralfe media
reports on the Russian diamond business with a note from him claiming that
such articles were harming the market.
Welcoming the creation of a new Russian-Yakutian joint stock company as
ending internal divisions over control of Russian diamonds, Mr Ralfe said
before meeting Mr Gurevich that he did not expect Russia to renegotiate
their present agreement.
But Mr Gurevich told a different story. Despite Mr Ralfe's assertion that Mr
Gurevich was 'not running the diamond business', the parliamentarian said he
would press for changes before the present deal expires in 1995.
He complained that while Australia could sell 15 per cent of its diamond
exports independently of the CSO, Russia could sell only 5 per cent. Even
then, the independent Russian sales, intended to test the prices fetched by
the CSO, could only be conducted in Moscow.
Mr Gurevich said: 'Can we talk seriously about this if there is no diamond
market in Moscow? We want to sell these diamonds abroad on the free market.'
Almazyuvelirexport, the state organisation that handles diamond sales and
signed the agreement with De Beers for the now defunct Soviet Union, agreed
yesterday that there was room for improvement. But Mr Pavel Kovilin, the
deputy director of Almazyuvelirexport, said his organisation would press for
changes only after the agreement expired.
He also claimed that the Moscow sales. which were attended by buyers from
all continents, fetched prices representative of the world market.
Although he has no formal role in running the Russian diamond business, Mr
Gurevich is capable of mobilising opinion against the present arrangements
if informal pressure for a better deal from De Beers does not work.
