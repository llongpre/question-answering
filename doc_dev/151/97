   A hostile $5 billion offer for Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC by South African-controlled Minorco SA cleared a major
roadblock Thursday when the British government gave it a green light.
   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission decided the offer for the
London-based mining and minerals company _ which would be this
country's biggest takeover ever _ wouldn't be against the public
interest, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   However, the bid faces other legal or regulatory hurdles in
Britain as well as the United States, the European Economic
Community, and other countries.
   Minorco, which is based in Luxembourg and has ties with South
Africa's Oppenheimer family, already holds 29.6 percent of its
target's stock. It has 21 days now to renew the bid, which
automatically lapsed when it was referred to the commission.
   Minorco said it had not yet decided whether to renew its bid, but
Consolidated Gold Fields stock moved up quickly on expectations that
Minorco would sweeten its offer.
   On London's Stock Exchange, Consolidated Gold Fields' shares
jumped 1.17 pounds ($2.05) to 14.20 pounds ($24.80). Minorco's
shares rose 14 pence (25 cents) to 731 pence ($12.79).
   Minorco's September bid was valued at 13.03 pounds ($22.80) a
share in cash and Minorco stock.
   The Oppenheimer family's gold-mining giant Anglo American Corp.
and its sister diamond group De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. own 60
percent of Minorco's shares.
   Consolidated Gold Fields' defense has included statements that
those connections would harm its businesses, because anti-apartheid
supporters might refuse to do business with them. Under white-led
South Africa's system of apartheid, the country's black majority is
disenfranchised.
   The commission said it did not find any likely problem with
Minorco's South African associations.
   In addition, the Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was
investigating a complaint by Consolidated Gold Fields alleging
anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel
controlled by De Beers.
