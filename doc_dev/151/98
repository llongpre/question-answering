De Beers has accused Russia of 'leaking' up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 322.5m)
worth of uncut diamonds on to the world market, seriously violating the
agreement between the South African group's Central Selling Organisation and
the Russian producers.
The company believes the contract, vital to maintaining control of rough
diamond prices, may not be renewable after the end of next year, when it
expires.
Talks in Moscow this week between De Beers executives and the Russian
Committee on Precious Metals, together with Mr Anatoly Golovaty, the deputy
finance minister, on the huge level of unofficial sales brought the two
sides no closer together. The company's executives remain pessimistic about
future co-operation.
Russia is the second-largest diamond producer after De Beers' own production
in Botswana and South Africa. Its defection from the De Beers-controlled
cartel would be likely to set off a price war that could send prices
tumbling. The CSO sold a record Dollars 2.6bn of diamonds in the first half
of 1994.
De Beers has limited scope for reasserting order in the market, in spite of
its traditional domination of diamond sales. If it refuses to renew the
agreement, it will be faced with a large producer capable of launching a
sustained attack on its prices. If it renews the contract, it may have to
accept a level of indiscipline that might also threaten price levels. It
would also send the wrong message to other cartel members such as Zaire,
Australia, Namibia and Angola.
The belief in Russia that producers could achieve a higher return outside
the cartel has been strengthened by the retirement of a generation of
officials used to working with De Beers in the cartel system - and the rise
of nationalist politicians hostile to the agreement on political and
economic grounds.
Mr Leonid Gurevich, formerly head of a parliamentary committee on gold and
precious metals and now vice-president in charge of diamonds at the State
Precious Metals Committee, believes the agreement with De Beers is too
restrictive and should be renewed only if it allows much more scope for free
sales.
De Beers executives, who have held a series of talks with the Russians this
year, presented evidence that the unofficial sales had lowered prices
worldwide - or at best kept them at last year's levels when increased
consumer demand would normally have caused an increase.
According to De Beers, the Russian officials accepted that there was
substantial unofficial selling and that prices were depressed, adding that
these sales were causing concern to the Russian authorities, which were
investigating how to stop them.
