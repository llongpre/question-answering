   Today is Friday, June 24, the 176th day of 1988. There are 190
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   Forty years ago, on June 24, 1948, Communist forces cut off all

English in the Battle of Bannockburn.

   In 1947, Kenneth Arnold of Boise, Idaho, reported seeing flying

   In 1948, the Republican National Convention, meeting in

   In 1968, Resurrection City, a shantytown constructed as part of
the Poor People's March on Washington D.C., was closed down by

   In 1975, 113 people were killed when an Eastern Airlines Boeing

   In 1982, proponents of a proposed equal rights amendment to the

   Ten years ago: A group of about two dozen neo-Nazis who had won,
but declined, the legal right to march in predominantly Jewish

were drowned out by more than 2,000 counter-demonstrators.
   Five years ago: The space shuttle Challenger _ carrying

   Today's Birthdays: Actor Al Molinaro is 69. Comedian Jack Carter
is 65. Movie director Claude Chabrol is 58. Actress Michele Lee isre is
nothing else to live in. To live in the present is like proposing
to sit on a pin. It is too minute, it is too slight a support, it
is too uncomfortable a posture. ... To live in the future is a
contradiction in terms. The future is dead, in the perfectly
definite sense that it is not alive.'' _ G.K. Chesterton, English
poet, critic, essayist (1874-1936).
