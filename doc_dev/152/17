   Today is Tuesday, Oct. 24, the 297th day of 1989. There are 68
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Fifty years ago, on Oct. 24, 1939, nylon stockings went on sale
for the first time as several stores in Wilmington, Del., began
offering the much-awaited hosiery made with Du Pont's new synthetic
yarn. The day's shipment of 4,000 pairs of nylon stockings, ranging
in price from $1.15 to $1.35 a pair, sold out quickly.
   On this date:

VII, died 12 days after giving birth to Prince Edward, later King
Edward VI.

President Abraham Lincoln.
   In 1901, Anna Edson Taylor, a 43-year-old widow, became the

   Ten years ago: President Carter announced the United States was
prepared to furnish $70 million in emergency food aid to Cambodia.
   Five years ago: A visit to Britain by French President Francois
Mitterrand was marred by a diplomatic flap as Scotland Yard
announced that a French bodyguard had planted unarmed explosives on
the grounds of the French ambassador's residence to test British
security.
   One year ago: The crew of the U.S.S. Vincennes received an
emotional homecoming in San Diego, nearly four months after the
cruiser shot down an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf, killing
all 290 people aboard.
   Today's Birthdays: American League president Dr. Bobby Brown is
