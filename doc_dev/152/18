   Today is Wednesday, Oct. 24, the 297th day of 1990. There are 68
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Oct. 24, 1901, Anna Edson Taylor, a 43-year-old widow, became
the first person to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel and live to
tell about it. (Mrs. Taylor's dreams of fame and fortune failed to
materialize, however, and she died in poverty in 1921.)
   On this date:
   In 1537, Jane Seymour, the third wife of England's King Henry
VIII, died 12 days after giving birth to Prince Edward, later King
Edward VI.
   In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia ended the 30 Years War and
effectively destroyed the Holy Roman Empire.
   In 1861, the first transcontinental telegraph message was sent
as Justice Stephen J. Field of California transmitted a telegram to
President Abraham Lincoln.
   In 1931, the George Washington Bridge, connecting New York and
New Jersey, opened to traffic.
   In 1939, nylon stockings went on sale for the first time as
several stores in Wilmington, Del., began offering the much-awaited
hosiery made from Du Pont's new synthetic yarn.
   In 1939, Benny Goodman and his orchestra recorded their
signature theme, ``Let's Dance,'' for Columbia Records in New York.
   In 1940, 50 years ago, the 40-hour work week went into effect
under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
   In 1945, the United Nations officially came into existence as
its charter took effect.
   In 1952, in a speech in Detroit, Republican presidential
candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower declared, ``I shall go to Korea'' as
he promised to end the war.
   In 1962, the U.S. blockade of Cuba during the missile crisis
officially began under a proclamation signed by President Kennedy
the day before.
   In 1987, 30 years after it was expelled for refusing to answer
allegations of corruption, the Teamsters union was welcomed back
into the AFL-CIO.
   Ten years ago: The merchant freighter S.S. Poet departed
Philadelphia bound for Port Said, Egypt, with a crew of 34 and a
cargo of grain; it was never heard from again. (The Coast Guard
believes the Poet sank in the Atlantic too quickly for any distress
call to be sent.)
   Five years ago: President Ronald Reagan committed the United
States to a ``fresh start'' in U.S.-Soviet relations during a
speech to the U.N. General Assembly. Ines Guadalupe Duarte Duran,
the daughter of El Salvador's president, Jose Napoleon Duarte, was
released by leftist rebels as part of a prisoner exchange.
   One year ago: Former television evangelist Jim Bakker was
sentenced by a judge in Charlotte, N.C., to 45 years in prison for
fraud and conspiracy.
   Today's Birthdays: Football Hall-of-Famer Y.A. Tittle is 64.
Actor-producer David Nelson is 54. Actor Kevin Kline is 43.
   Thought for Today: ``History must always be taken with a grain
of salt. It is, after all, not a science but an art.'' - Phyllis
McGinley, American poet and author (1905-1978).
