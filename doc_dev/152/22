FT  08 OCT 93 / Arts: The Wilton Diptych remains enigmatic

In an age which has seen blockbuster exhibitions swell to ever more
monstrous proportions, the National Gallery in London has pioneered series
of modest shows which recognise how rewarding it can be to look hard and
think about a single work. For the first in a new series, Making and
Meaning, which again focuses on major works in its own collection, the
spotlight is directed towards the Wilton Diptych in the aftermath of its
recent cleaning and technical examination.
This small, portable altarpiece is one of the most refined and sumptuous
products of the late medieval world. It is also one of the most enigmatic.
Generations of scholars have debated who painted it, and why, and what it
meant to those who first saw it. The purpose of this exhibition, which is
supplemented by a small number of judicious loans of panels, manuscripts,
sculpture, metalwork and jewellery, is to offer visitors the possibility of
understanding a private and complex image. The temptation to tell them how
to interpret it is scrupulously resisted.
Although the Wilton Diptych has the inevitability of a dream, its two halves
make for a distinctly odd couple. On the barren earth of the left wing
kneels Richard II of England, identified as such by his personal emblems of
the white hart on his breast and the broomcods, or pods of the broom plant -
the planta genista from which the Plantagenets took their name - laced
around his neck. The three figures standing behind him - Edmund, king and
martyr, Edward the Confessor and John the Baptist - act as intercessors and
have been carefully chosen for their personal significance for the monarch.
The frieze of saints is remarkable for its evenly distributed verticality
while the profile portrait of the king has all the depth of a playing card.
The crowded panoply of the right wing could hardly be more different. Here
the Virgin stands cradling the Christ Child in a paradise garden, supported
by a company of angels who, wearing broomcods and white harts, seem to have
been liveried by the King of England rather than the Queen of Heaven. Arms
crossed, wings fluttering, seven of them form a backdrop to her, while four
more ring her round. This image is the epitome of a manner of painting that
was swept away by the Renaissance and the discovery of perspective, but here
too there is pictorial space.
The narrative link between the two is provided by the white banner
emblazoned by the red cross of Christ's Resurrection which is also the
banner of St George. Its pinnacle is a silvered orb and that too alludes to
England. Recent cleaning has revealed that it contains a minute
representation of a green island, a white tower with two turrets, and a boat
in full sail. It is hard not to read it as 'this sceptred isle . . . and
precious stone set in the silver sea' of John of Gaunt's speech in
Shakespeare's Richard II.
This is no standard image of a donor being presented to the Virgin by his
patrons. Rather, it appears a carefully orchestrated expression of Richard's
notion of the divine nature of his kingship and his hopes for salvation. As
such, the altarpiece is likely to have been made for the private devotions
of the king, a few years before his untimely death in 1399.
The Wilton Diptych is one of the high points of the so-called International
Style, that phase of late Gothic art when painters and sculptors all over
Europe seemed to be marching to the same drum. Such is the extent of
cross-fertilisation that no agreement has been reached about whether its
creator was English, French, Italian or Bohemian. The recent technical
examination has only confirmed that while the preparation of the ground of
the oak panels is typically Northern, the technique adopted for binding the
pigments and for the green undermodelling of the flesh tones is
characteristically Italian. The use of egg white allowed the painter to
exploit the full purity of the precious lapis lazuli which he ground to
produce the brilliant ultramarine.
Wherever he came from, the anonymous master of the Wilton Diptych was a
great painter. This is his (or her?) only surviving work. We have no idea
whether it belongs to his youth, maturity or old age. One thing is certain,
however: if it had not survived, no one would have felt the lack of it. The
picture stands as a poignant reminder of how much of our past has been lost.
That, and not just its quality, is part of its enchantment.
