   Today is Sunday, March 4, the 63rd day of 1990. There are 302
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On March 4, 1789, the Constitution of the United States went
into effect as the first Federal Congress met in New York. The
lawmakers then adjourned for the lack of a quorum.
   On this date:
   In 1681, England's King Charles II granted a charter to William
Penn for an area of land that later became Pennsylvania.
   In 1791, Vermont became the 14th state.
   In 1829, an unruly crowd mobbed the White House during the
inaugural reception for President Jackson.
   In 1837, the Illinois state legislature granted a city charter
to Chicago.
   In 1861, the Confederacy adopted the ``Stars and Bars'' flag
design.
   In 1902, the American Automobile Association was founded in
Chicago.
   In 1917, Republican Jeannette Rankin of Montana took her seat as
a member of Congress, the first woman to be elected to the House of
Representatives.
   In 1925, President Coolidge's inauguration was broadcast live on
21 radio stations coast-to-coast.
   In 1933, in his inaugural address, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt pledged effective leadership to pull the country out of
the Great Depression, saying, ``The only thing we have to fear is
fear itself.''
   In 1933, the start of the Roosevelt administration brought with
it the first woman to serve on a president's Cabinet: Labor
Secretary Frances Perkins.
   In 1952, actor Ronald Reagan and actress Nancy Davis were
married in San Fernando Valley, Calif.
   In 1971, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau married
Margaret Sinclair in North Vancouver, British Columbia. (They later
divorced.)
   In 1977, more than 1,500 people were killed when an earthquake
measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale and centered north of Bucharest,
Romania, shook southern and eastern Europe.
   In 1987, President Reagan addressed the nation on the
Iran-Contra affair, acknowledging that his once-secret overtures to
Iran had ``deteriorated'' into an arms-for-hostages deal.
   Ten years ago: Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts won his
state's Democratic presidential primary, defeating incumbent Jimmy
Carter by a better than two-to-one margin.
   Five years ago: President Reagan pressed Congress to move ahead
with the MX missile program, calling it vital to U.S. security.
   One year ago: Eastern Airlines machinists went on strike and
were joined by pilots and flight attendants, all but paralyzing the
carrier's operations.
   Also one year ago: Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
announced plans to merge, creating the world's largest media and
entertainment conglomerate.
   Today's birthdays: Actress Paula Prentiss is 51. Rock musician
Chris Squire is 42. Actress Kay Lenz is 37.
   Thought for today: ``Religion is excellent stuff for keeping
common people quiet.'' _ Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821).
