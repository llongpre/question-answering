   Today is Saturday, March 4, the 63rd day of 1989. There are 302
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Two hundred years ago, on March 4, 1789, the Constitution of the
United States went into effect as the first Federal Congress met in
New York. However, the lawmakers had to adjourn for the lack of a
quorum.
   On this date:
   In 1681, England's King Charles II granted a charter to William
Penn for an area of land that later became Pennsylvania.
   In 1791, Vermont became the 14th state.
   In 1829, an unruly crowd mobbed the White House during the
inaugural reception for President Andrew Jackson.
   In 1837, the Illinois state Legislature granted a city charter to
Chicago.
   In 1861, the Confederacy adopted the Stars and Bars flag design.
   In 1889, silent movie star Pearl White, who became famous for the
serial ``The Perils of Pauline,'' was born in Green Ridge, Mo.
   In 1902, the American Automobile Association was founded in
Chicago.
   In 1917, Republican Jeannette Rankin of Montana took her seat as
a member of Congress, the first woman to be elected to the House of
Representatives.
   In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge's inauguration was broadcast
live on 21 radio stations from coast to coast.
   In 1933, in his inaugural address, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt pledged effective leadership to pull the country out of
the Great Depression, saying, ``The only thing we have to fear is
fear itself.''
   In 1933, the start of the Roosevelt administration brought with
it the first woman to serve on a president's Cabinet: Labor
Secretary Frances Perkins.
   In 1952, actor Ronald Reagan and actress Nancy Davis were married
in San Fernando Valley, Calif.
   In 1971, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau married
Margaret Sinclair in North Vancouver, British Columbia. They later
divorced.
   In 1977, more than 1,500 people were killed when an earthquake
measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale and centered north of Bucharest,
Romania, shook southern and eastern Europe.
   In 1978, The Chicago Daily News, first begun in 1875, published
its last issue with the headline, ``So Long, Chicago.''
   In 1987, President Reagan addressed the nation on the Iran-Contra
affair, acknowledging that his once-secret overtures to Iran had
``deteriorated'' into an arms-for-hostages deal.
   Ten years ago:
   President Carter and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin met
for a third and final day to try to break a stalemate in the Middle
East peace process, and came away showing signs of a possible
breakthrough.
   Five years ago:
   Four days after winning the New Hampshire primary, Sen. Gary Hart
won the Maine Democratic caucuses, effectively shredding Walter
Mondale's claim as front-runner for the party's presidential
nomination.
   One year ago: The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the
nation's civilian unemployment rate had dropped to 5.7 percent in
February.
   Today's birthdays: Actress Paula Prentiss is 50. Rock musician
Chris Squire is 41. Actress Kay Lenz is 36.
   Thought for today: ``Loafing needs no explanation and is its own
excuse.'' _Christopher Morley, American author and journalist
(1890-1957).
