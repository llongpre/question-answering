   Today is Tuesday, Aug. 9, the 222nd day of 1988. There are 144
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Aug. 9, 1945, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb
on Japan, destroying part of the city of Nagasaki. An estimated
74,000 people died from the blast or its after-effects. (Nagasaki
was not the original target; heavy clouds prevented the bombing of
Kokura in northern Kyushu.)
   On this date:
   In 1842, a border dispute between the United States and Canada
was resolved with the signing of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty.
   In 1848, the Free-Soil Party nominated Martin Van Buren for
president at its convention in Buffalo, N.Y.
   In 1854, Henry David Thoreau published ``Walden,'' in which he
described his experiences while living in a small cabin near Walden
Pond in Massachusetts.
   In 1902, Edward VII was crowned King of England following the
death of his mother, Queen Victoria.
   In 1930, a forerunner of the cartoon character Betty Boop made
her debut in Max Fleischer's animated short ``Dizzy Dishes.''
   In 1936, Jesse Owens won his fourth gold medal at the Berlin
Olympics as the United States took first place in the 400-meter
relay.
   In 1942, Britain arrested Indian nationalist Mohandas K. Gandhi;
he would not be released until 1944.
   In 1969, actress Sharon Tate and four other people were found
murdered in a Bel Air, Calif., home. Four people, including Charles
Manson, were later convicted of the crime.
   In 1974, President Richard M. Nixon's resignation took effect.
Vice President Gerald R. Ford became the nation's 38th chief
executive.
   In 1982, a federal judge in Washington ordered John W. Hinckley
Jr., who was acquitted of shooting President Reagan and three
others by reason of insanity, committed to a mental hospital.
   Ten years ago: The body of Pope Paul VI, who had died Aug. 6 at
age 80, was carried from the papal residence at Castel Gandolfo to
Vatican City for burial rites.
   Five years ago: Guatemala's new military leader, Brig. Gen.
Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, lifted a 40-day-old state of alert
imposed by the president he ousted, Efrain Rios Montt.
   One year ago: Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, vowing to
investigate the Iran-Contra affair ``vigorously but fairly,'' told
a meeting of the American Bar Association in San Francisco that he
would not be deterred by the ``popularity of persons involved.''
   Today's birthdays: Former Georgia Sen. Herman Talmadge is 75.
Former baseball manager Ralph Houk is 69. Sen. J. James Exon,
D-Neb., is 67. Comedian-director David Steinberg is 46. Actor Sam
Elliott is 44. Boxer Ken Norton is 43. Actress Melanie Griffith is
31. Singer Whitney Houston is 25.
   Thought for today: ``A definite purpose, like blinders on a
horse, inevitably narrows its possessor's point of view.'' _ Robert
Frost, American poet (1874-1963).
