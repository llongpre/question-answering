   Today is Thursday, May 19, the 140th day of 1988. There are 226
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On May 19, 1536, Anne Boleyn, the second wife of England's King
Henry VIII, was beheaded after she was convicted of adultery.
During their marriage, Anne had given birth to a daughter, who
later became Queen Elizabeth I; however, Anne fell from Henry's
favor by failing to produce any male heirs.
   On this date:
   In 1780, a mysterious darkness enveloped much of New England and
part of Canada in the early afternoon. The cause has never been
determined.
   In 1906, the Federated Boys' Clubs, forerunner of the Boys'
Clubs of America, were organized.
   In 1921, Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act, which
established national quotas for immigrants entering the U.S.
   In 1926, inventor Thomas Edison was prevailed upon to speak on
radio during the dinner of the National Electric Light Association
in Atlantic City, N.J. (Confronted with the microphone, Edison
said: ``Why, I don't know what to say. This is the first time I
ever spoke into one of these things. Good night.'')
   In 1935, T.E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, died
following a motorcycle accident.
   In 1943, in an address to the U.S.Congress, British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill pledged his country's full support in
the war against Japan.
   In 1958, the United States and Canada formally established the
North American Air Defense Command.
   In 1964, the State Department disclosed that 40 hidden
microphones had been found in the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
   In 1967, the Soviet Union ratified a treaty with the United
States and Britain banning nuclear weapons from outer space.
   Ten years ago: French and Belgian paratroopers began entering
the mining town of Kolwezi in Zaire to rescue more than 2,500
Europeans caught in the fighting between Zarian government troops
and rebel forces.
   Five years ago: About 20,000 people marched in solemn silence to
a cemetery in Warsaw, Poland, to mourn Grzegorz Przemyk, a
teen-ager who died after being taken into police custody May 12,
three days before his 19th birthday.
   One year ago: Two days after 37 American sailors were killed
when an Iraqi warplane attacked the U.S. frigate Stark, President
Reagan defended the American presence in the Persian Gulf, and said
the tragedy of the Stark ``must never be repeated.''
   Today's Birthdays: PBS newscaster Jim Lehrer is 54. TV
