   Friends of former President Franklin D.
Roosevelt celebrated Sunday the 50th anniversary of King George VI's
visit to Hyde Park, believed to have strengthened U.S.-Anglo
relations on the eve of World War II.
   About 250 people turned out at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library
on the grounds of the Roosevelt home, said William Emerson, library
director.
   England's King George and Queen Elizabeth visited Roosevelt's
home June 11, 1939, during a tour of the United States.
   Sunday's celebration began the same way the king and queen's
visit did, with morning prayers at St. James Episcopal Church.
British Amabassador Antony Acland read an Episcopalian lesson
similar to the service attended by the Roosevelts and the king and
queen in 1939.
   Acland opened a special exhibit at the FDR Library that includes
the king's notes on conversations he had with Roosevelt about how
the United States might help Great Britain against Germany, Emerson
said.
   Acland also read a message from Queen Mother Elizabeth
reminiscing about her 1939 visit.
   Roosevelt invited the king and queen as part of his strategy to
shift American public opinion and policy away from isolationism,
Emerson said.
