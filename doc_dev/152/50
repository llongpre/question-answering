<LEADPARA>  In December 1940, with German bombs raining on his cities, Britain's Duke of
Windsor tried to enlist President Roosevelt to sell out his country to Hitler,
the custodian of 50-year-old interview notes said Thursday.;   The duke, who
four years earlier had abdicated as king of England to marry a divorced
American woman, is said to have made the overture to author Fulton Oursler,
who was interviewing him for Liberty magazine.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      Oursler's notes say the plan was for Roosevelt to offer to intervene for
peace between England and Germany. The duke, still enormously popular in his
beleaguered nation, would immediately support the idea in terms that would
touch off a revolution in Britain.;   During the interview with the former
Edward VIII, Oursler brought up speculation that Hitler might be overthrown by
Germans in the wake of Italian defeats in Greece.;   Oursler's notes say the
duke "said there was too much wishful thinking; that there would be no
revolution in Germany and it would be a tragic thing for the world if Hitler
were overthrown. Hitler, he said, was the right and logical leader of the
German people. . . . He regarded Hitler as a great man.";   When Oursler saw
Roosevelt later, the president already knew about the proposal, says Oursler's
son, Fulton Oursler Jr.;   Roosevelt then drafted an ambiguous reply, which
evidently put an end to the overture.  </TEXT>
