   Today is Tuesday, July 12, the 194th day of 1988. There are 172
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On July 12, 1984, Democratic presidential candidate Walter F.
Mondale announced he had chosen New York congresswoman Geraldine A.
Ferraro to be his running mate. Ferraro was the first woman to run
for the vice presidency of the United States on a major-party
ticket.
   On this date:
   In 100 B.C., the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar was born.
   In 1543, England's King Henry VIII married his sixth and last
wife, Catherine Parr, who would outlive him.
   In 1812, United States forces led by Gen. William Hull invaded
Canada during the War of 1812 against Britain.
   In 1817, naturalist-author Henry David Thoreau was born in
Concord, Mass.
   In 1854, George Eastman, inventor of the Kodak camera, was born
in Waterville, N.Y.
   In 1862, Congress authorized the Medal of Honor.
   In 1933, the U.S. government set the minimum wage at 40-cents an
hour.
   In 1974, John Ehrlichman, a former aide to President Richard M.
Nixon, and three others were convicted of conspiring to violate the
civil rights of Daniel Ellsberg's former psychiatrist.
   In 1977, President Jimmy Carter offended abortion-rights
advocates as he defended Supreme Court decisions limiting
government payments for poor women's abortions, saying, ``There are
many things in life that are not fair.''
   In 1985, doctors discovered a cancerous growth in President
Reagan's large intestine.
   Ten years ago: The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Andrew
Young, found himself in the middle of a political storm after he
was quoted in a French newspaper (Le Matin) as saying, ``There are
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of political prisoners in the United
States.''
   Five years ago: Robert K. Steinberg, an attorney who claimed to
have videotapes showing murdered model Vicki Morgan engaging in sex
acts with prominent government officials, reported the tapes had
been stolen. (Their existence has never been independently
confirmed.)
   One year ago: For the first time in 20 years, a delegation of
Soviet diplomats arrived in Israel without fanfare for what was
described as a ``technical mission'' to document Soviet citizens
and make an inventory of Soviet property.
   Today's Birthdays: Comedian Milton Berle is 80. Sen. Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore., is 66. Pianist Van Cliburn is 54. Comedian Bill
Cosby is 51.
   Thought for Today: ``The recipe for perpetual ignorance is: be
satisfied with your opinions and content with your knowledge.'' _
Elbert Hubbard, American author and publisher (1856-1915).
