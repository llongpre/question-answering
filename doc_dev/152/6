Simon Russell Beale
If you want to see a play wrecked by a wrong choice of costume, go to the
Royal Shakespeare Company's Edward II, which has arrived at The Pit from
Stratford. To be fair to the designers, there are a lot more faults in this
production than the wardrobe, but the clothes do set a tone. If you dress
the characters in black and white leather jackets, trousers to go with them,
and heaven knows what the Queen is wearing, you are at a disadvantage from
the start.
For a number of reasons, the production never quite recovers from this
self-inflicted wound. Simon Russell Beale is an actor of great versatility;
he is not, however, one of nature's Edward IIs. The point about the part is
that he has a strong homosexual attraction to his favourites. He is also the
King of England with wars to fight, civil and foreign. To carry this off, in
the court and on the stage, requires a certain style. Beale plays the role
as someone short, fat and stupid who hops about like a bloated frog.
The message may be that you do not have to be beautiful to have homosexual
passions. Yet it would help if there were a certain style. Beale is simply
gross. He never rises to the part. Moreover, he shouts - repeatedly and
unnecessarily. So do much of the rest of the cast. This is not a production
of light and shade.
Edward II, admittedly, is not Christopher Marlowe's best play: not a patch
on Tamburlaine the Great or Dr Faustus. But it does have its moments as well
as unmistakeable affinities with Shakespeare's Richard II. Its greatest
attraction is Piers Gaveston, the King's first favourite. The RSC's
Gaveston, played by Grant Thatcher, comes into his own only when he has been
beaten up and his mouth is covered in blood - like lipstick. By then, he has
little left to say. Before that, he is dressed in his ridiculous white
leather clothes with sequins. The only surprise is that he does not wear an
earring. That is left to the King's next favourite, Spencer, whom we first
see under a sheet with a curate.
The nobles and the clerics are wooden. This may be deliberate. For if the
King does not behave like a king, even a deviant king, the court can hardly
be expected to behave like a court. The general entourage is more like that
of a rotary club faced with unseemly goings on, which cannot have been what
Marlowe intended. There ought also to be room for some humour, since most of
the characters go through a remarkable number of changes of mind. That is
not there either.
The best performance is by Ciaran Hands as the young Mortimer. By the time
he has become an accomplice to murder, his black jacket is decked with
phosphorescent green. For the rest, it is a pretty grim evening. The
direction is by Gerard Murphy.
