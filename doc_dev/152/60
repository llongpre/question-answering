If the Governors of the big central banks can use their regular monthly
meetings at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle to get to know
each other socially, why can't the other ranks do the same?
It seems that some of them are planning to do just that, but in less formal
surroundings. Observer hears that the top economists of the Bank of England,
the Banque de France and the Bundesbank have decided to break with tradition
and inaugurate regular get-togethers. Mervyn King, Andre Icard and Otmar
Issing are kicking off with a cosy dinner in Paris tonight.
Of course, there is a fairly heavy menu. The trio will be debating the
outlook for German interest rates after last week's German public sector pay
deal. Additionally, they will be discussing prospects for harmonising the
central banks' monetary policy instruments ahead of moves towards monetary
union.
If they have any time over fruit and cheese, they might get around to
discussing the chimeric question of where the European central bank should
be sited. Naturally, the Bundesbank's Issing is keen on Frankfurt, while the
Bank of England's King has a sneaking suspicion that Bonn might be the
compromise candidate to back.
