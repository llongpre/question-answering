   Today is Tuesday, June 28, the 180th day of 1988. There are 186
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On June 28, 1914, Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his
wife, Sofia, were assassinated in present-day Sarajevo, Yugoslavia,
by a Serbian revolutionary _ the event that triggered World War I.
Exactly 5 years later, the Treaty of Versailles was signed in
France, officially ending the international conflict.
   On this date:
   In 1491, England's King Henry VIII was born in Greenwich.
   In 1778, Mary Ludwig Hays gained the name ``Molly Pitcher'' and
a place in U.S. history by aiding American forces at the Battle of
Monmouth in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War.
   In 1836, the fourth president of the United States, James
Madison, died in Montpelier, Va.
   In 1838, Britain's Queen Victoria was crowned in Westminster
Abbey.
   In 1894, Labor Day was established as a holiday for federal
employees on the first Monday of September.
   In 1919, Harry S. Truman married Elizabeth Virginia Wallace in
Independence, Mo.
   In 1928, New York Gov. Alfred E. Smith was nominated for
president at the Democratic National Convention in Houston.
   In 1939, Pan American Airways began regular trans-Atlantic air
service as the Dixie Clipper left Port Washington, N.Y., for
Portugal.
   In 1950, North Korean forces captured Seoul, South Korea.
   In 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a 1974 law giving the
government control over former President Richard M. Nixon's White
House papers and tape recordings.
   Ten years ago: The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the University of
California Medical College at Davis to admit Allan Bakke, a white
man who claimed he was a victim of reverse discrimination when the
school rejected his application. However, the high court also
upheld the constitutionality of certain affirmative action college
programs.
   Five years ago: A 100-foot section of bridge along Interstate 95
in Greenwich, Conn., collapsed, killing three people. Federal
investigators later blamed the collapse on the accumulation of rust
on the pin-and-hanger assembly that held the bridge sections
together.
   One year ago: Secretary of State George P. Shultz said on NBC's
``Meet the Press'' that he found some of the recent revelations
about the Iran-Contra affair ``sickening,'' but he defended the
Reagan administration's foreign policy.
   Today's birthdays: Comedian-movie director Mel Brooks is 62.
Comedian-actress Gilda Radner is 42. Actress Danielle Brisebois is
19.
   Thought for today: ``This only is charity, to do all, all that
we can.'' _ John Donne, English poet (1573-1631).
