   Today is Sunday, Jan. 15, the 15th day of 1989. There are 350
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:

   On this date:

Abbey.

   In 1987, entertainer Ray Bolger, perhaps best known for his role
as the Scarecrow in the 1939 MGM musical ``The Wizard of Oz,'' died
in Los Angeles at age 83.
   Ten years ago: On Capitol Hill, the 96th Congress convened amid
predictions the session would focus on budget-balancing and tax cuts.
   Five years ago: Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale found
himself the target of fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls during
a debate in Hanover, N.H., and denounced as ``baloney'' charges that
he was guilty of vague, costly promises.
   One year ago: In Jerusalem, riot police charged into the Al Aqsa
and Dome of the Rock mosques after worshipers beat a policeman and
stole his pistol during some of the worst clashes ever seen on the
revered Temple Mount.
   Today's birthdays: Actor Lloyd Bridges is 76. The archbishop of
New York, John J. O'Connor, is 69. Actress Margaret O'Brien is 52.
