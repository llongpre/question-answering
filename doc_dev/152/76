   Today's Highlight in History:

   In 1909, French aviator Louis Bleriot flew across the English
Channel in a monoplane, traveling from Calais to Dover in 37

pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident,
then went on television to address his constituents.
   In 1978, the first ``test tube baby'' was born in Oldham,
England. Louise Joy Brown had been conceived through the technique
of ``in-vitro fertilization'' pioneered by Patrick Steptoe and
Robert Edwards.
   In 1979, President Carter issued a letter absolving Dr. Samuel
Mudd, the physician who'd treated the broken leg of John Wilkes
Booth, of any role in the assassination of President Lincoln.
   In 1984, Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya became the first

experiments outside the orbiting space station ``Salyut Seven.''
   Ten years ago: Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti disclosed
   that he and President Carter had discussed Billy Carter's ties with
Libya the previous month, following earlier denials that any such
conversation had occurred.
   Five years ago: A spokeswoman for Rock Hudson confirmed that the
actor, hospitalized in Paris, was suffering from ``AIDS.'' (Hudson
died the following October.)
   One year ago: The pilot of the United DC-10 that crashed in
Sioux City, Iowa, July 19, Alfred C. Haynes, appeared at a news
conference in which he dismissed descriptions of himself as a hero,
even though he and his crew managed to save the lives of 184 of the
296 people on the crippled aircraft.
   Today's Birthdays: Actress Janet Margolin is 47. Singer Donna
   Theodore is 45. Test-tube baby Louise Joy Brown is 12.

   but refraining from hurting others, and comforting those that are
sad.'' -- Olive Schreiner, South African author and feminist
(1855-1920).
