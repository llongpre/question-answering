   Today is Monday, Oct. 24, the 298th day of 1988. There are 68
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   In 1945, the United Nations officially came into existence as
its charter took effect. The world body began with 51 members in
1945, a figure that has more than tripled since then.
   On this date:
   In 1537, Jane Seymour, the third wife of England's King Henry
VIII, died 12 days after giving birth to Prince Edward, later King
Edward VI.
   In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War and
effectively destroyed the Holy Roman Empire.
   In 1861, the first transcontinental telegraph message was sent
as Justice Stephen J. Field of California transmitted a telegram to
President Abraham Lincoln.
   In 1901, Anna Edson Taylor, a 43-year-old widow, became the
first person to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel and live to tell
about it. Mrs. Taylor's dreams of fame and fortune failed to
materialize, however, and she died in poverty in 1921.
   In 1931, the George Washington Bridge, connecting New York and
New Jersey, opened to traffic.
   In 1939, the first nylon stockings went on sale, in Wilmington,
Del.
   In 1940, the 40-hour work week went into effect under the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938.
   In 1952, in a speech in Detroit, Republican presidential
candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower declared, ``I shall go to Korea'' as
he promised to end the war.
   In 1962, the U.S. blockade of Cuba during the missile crisis
officially began under a proclamation signed by President John F.
Kennedy the day before.
   In 1976, 25 people were killed when a fire set by an arsonist
broke out at a social club in New York City's South Bronx section.
   Ten years ago: A jury in Hackensack, N.J., found Dr. Mario
Jascalevich innocent of charges he had murdered three hospital
patients with the muscle relaxant curare in the mid-1960s. The
judge also freed New York Times reporter Myron Farber, who was
jailed 40 days for his refusal to turn over notes on the case.
   Five years ago: President Reagan told a news conference he was
determined to keep U.S. Marines stationed in Lebanon, despite a
truck-bomb attack in Beirut the day before that claimed the lives
of 241 servicemen.
   One year ago: Thirty years after it was expelled for refusing to
answer allegations of corruption, the Teamsters union was welcomed
back into the AFL-CIO by a vote of the labor federation's executive
council in Miami Beach, Fla.
   Today's birthdays: American League President Bobby Brown is 63.
Football hall-of-famer Y.A. Tittle is 62. Actor-producer David
Nelson is 52. Rock musician Bill Wyman is 47. Actor Kevin Kline is
41.
   Thought for today: ``There has never been any 30-hour week for
men who had anything to do.'' _ Charles F. Kettering, American
inventor (1876-1958).
