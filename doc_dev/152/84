THE CITY centre of Caen in Normandy is hardly picture postcard country, but
there is one carte postale I found irresistible. It shows two views side by
side. One is of present-day Caen: an unremarkable skyline of rooftops and
church steeples. The other is of exactly the same scene in 1944, after
allied and German bombing had reduced 75 per cent of the city to rubble.
You can hardly see the joins in modern Caen, which in its pristine
restoration is a monument to its craftsmen. The French have lovingly
recreated the city centre in the famous local stone and made a tourist
industry out of other D-Day sights, from the Normandy landing points to the
Museum of Peace, on the edge of the city.
It is a shame, then, that while so brilliantly restoring their immediate
past, the local authorities in Normandy appear overwhelmed by the task of
maintaining their more distant heritage. Disintegrating chateaux, bulging
barn walls, peeling country houses and collapsed floors bear witness to the
pathetic decay of many rural buildings.
As is not the case in England, the immense burden of restoring the huge
number of historic sights in Normandy falls largely on private owners. In
many cases they are achieving wonders, but the battle against time and the
elements is visibly still not won.
Normandy's weather is wet, its fields fertile; its old castles still have a
fairy-tale air about them. Away from the thundering Caen-Paris autoroute,
the morning mist swirls over a countryside of one-storey timbered cottages
their rustic dereliction a reminder of rural life as it used to be in the
English home counties.
It is lovely to behold, but a closer look shows much of it decaying at a
fast rate as I began to realise when visiting the Eure, one of Normandy's
five departements. Outside one chateau I noticed that part of the medieval
wall around the grounds was collapsing and that its original wattle and daub
was bulging out for all to see. I thought this extraordinary, never having
seen such a sight in England without archaeologists' barriers keeping the
sticky-fingered public at bay. Here, I could have prodded and pulled to my
heart's content. There was not a soul around, let alone a barrier.
Inside, the chateau had its top rooms shut to the public because the roof
was disintegrating. On the way back to my rented gite I passed a classic
medieval timbered Normandy barn, its wall collapsing into the road. In its
death throes the barn showed us its innards - the wattle, daub and beams
used several centuries previously. It was a gem that in England would be
meticulously preserved; in Normandy it was falling to bits.
When I later visited the former abbey church in the market town of Bernay I
was first aghast and then annoyed to find it given over to a sale of antique
and expensively-priced wardrobes. A later trip to the 17th century chateau
of Beaumesnil near Evreux revealed upper floors closed to the public with
cracks in the ceiling and wall plaster. Ditto for the nearby chateau of
Harcourt, erected in the 12th century by a Crusades companion of England's
King Richard the Lionheart and later rebuilt in the 17th century.
Its current owner, an agricultural institute, has obviously done sterling
resurrection work to what 20 years ago was a ruin. But the decay on the
upper floors suggests the scale of the task still to be completed. Even the
home of Claude Monet in Giverny, now a must on most tourists' schedules (it
is only 90 minutes from Paris), has been restored largely with US money.
In Britain, numerous great houses have been handed to the National Trust to
maintain, but in Normandy the fact that so many mansions are privately owned
is both charming and worrying. It gives an individual character to many
properties but means that potential income which could be used on
maintenance is being lost through poor or non-existent marketing.
Part of the problem is the sheer number of historic sights in Normandy. The
excellent and locally-published guide, Chateaux and Gardens of Normandy, by
Philippe Seydoux lists 47 historic properties in east Normandy and 57 in
west Normandy open to the public - virtually all privately owned. Many have
been beautifully restored; at others, the efforts at maintenance are
excellent. But these are the ones whose owners have renovated them and are
prepared to take visitors. It excludes countless others that are abandoned
or simply closed to public view.
Even with those which are open, Seydoux advises visitors to check conditions
of entry first. This is wise since the listed sights are not, like most of
those in England, regularly open to the public. The owner of the fine 17th
century chateau of Boiset-les-Prevances, for example, near Evreux, will only
receive groups of visitors by advance appointment.
Normandy is a wonderful area for gentle touring. It would be a pity if much
more of it crumbled and fell.
