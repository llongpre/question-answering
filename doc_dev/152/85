   The archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual head of
the Anglican Church, will visit Pope John Paul II in Rome in the
autumn, primarily to discuss church unity, the archbishop's office
announced Sunday.
   The Most Rev. Robert Runcie, who also heads the 70
million-member Anglican Communion, will be in Rome from Sept. 29 to
Oct. 2, his spokeswoman Eve Keatley said.
   Runcie and the pope have met four times _ in 1980, in 1982 and
twice in 1986. It will be Runcie's first visit to Rome as
archbishop of Canterbury.
   ``The archbishop sees the visit as an opportunity to make a
strong affirmation of the commitment of Anglicans and Roman
Catholics to unity whatever obstacles there are to be overcome,''
Mrs. Keatley said.
   The Anglican Church was established during the Reformation of
the 16th century after England's King Henry VIII broke with the
Vatican when Pope Clement VII refused the king a divorce.
   The two largest Christian churches have made tentative efforts
toward unity, but many Anglicans do not accept the concept of papal
infallibility and the likely primacy of the pope in a unified
church.
   In the 700 million-member Roman Catholic Church, a major
stumbling block is the ordination of women, which some branches of
the Anglican Communion accept.
   Mrs. Keatley said the visit had been under consideration before
the consecration of the first woman bishop in the Anglican
Communion, the Rt. Rev. Barbara Harris of the Episcopal Church of
the United States.
   The two church leaders will review the work of the
Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission.
   John Paul, in an Easter letter to the archbishop, welcomed the
visit as ``an occasion for responding anew to the will of Christ
for the unity of his followers,'' Mrs. Keatley said.
   The previous two archbishops of Canterbury, Arthur Ramsey and
Frederick Coggan, both made official visits to Rome.
