   Today is Tuesday, July 25, the 206th day of 1989. There are 159
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 25, 1956, 51 lives were lost when the Italian liner
Andrea Doria sank after it collided with the Swedish ship Stockholm
south of Nantucket Island off the New England coast.
   On this date:
   In 1593, France's King Henry IV, a Protestant, converted to Roman
Catholicism.
   In 1866, Ulysses S. Grant was named General of the Army, the
first officer to hold the rank.
   In 1868, Congress passed an act creating the Wyoming Territory.
   In 1909, French aviator Louis Bleriot flew across the English
Channel in a monoplane, traveling from Calais to Dover in 37 minutes.
   In 1943, Benito Mussolini was dismissed as premier of Italy
during World War II.
   In 1952, Puerto Rico became a self-governing commonwealth of the
United States.
   In 1963, the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain
initialed a treaty in Moscow prohibiting the testing of nuclear
weapons in the atmosphere, in space or underwater.
   In 1978, the first test tube baby was born in Oldham, England.
Louise Joy Brown had been conceived through the technique of
in-vitro fertilization pioneered by Patrick Steptoe and Robert
Edwards.
   In 1985, a spokeswoman for Rock Hudson confirmed that the actor,
hospitalized in Paris, was suffering from AIDS. (Hudson died the
following October.)
   In 1986, movie director Vincente Minnelli, famous for directing
such film musicals as ``Gigi,'' ``An American in Paris'' and ``The
Band Wagon,'' died in Los Angeles at age 76.
   Ten years ago: President Jimmy Carter tapped Paul A. Volcker to
be chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Carter issued a letter
absolving Dr. Samuel Mudd, the physician who'd treated the broken
leg of John Wilkes Booth, of any role in the assassination of
President Abraham Lincoln.
   Five years ago: Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya became the
first woman to walk in space as she carried out more than three
hours of experiments outside the orbiting space station Salyut VII.
   One year ago: A judge in New York ordered the feuding San Diego
Yacht Club and a New Zealand challenger to settle the battle for the
America's Cup with a September race. (The Americans used a
two-hulled catamaran to easily defeat the New Zealanders' monohull,
but a judge last March ordered that the cup be awarded to the New
Zealand team.)
   Today's Birthdays: Actor Jack Gilford is 82. Actress Janet
Margolin is 46. Singer Donna Theodore is 44. Louise Joy Brown is 11.
   Thought for Today: ``I never liked the middle ground _ the most
boring place in the world.'' _ Louise Nevelson, Russian-American
