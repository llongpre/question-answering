<HEAD>Prince Charles Says He's Matured Into Future King</HEAD>

   Prince Charles, in his first television
interview in five years, says he has matured into his role as the
future king of England and finds that he is taken more seriously
than in the past.
   On the CBS News program ``West 57th,'' which was broadcast
Saturday night, the Prince of Wales said one area where he is taken
more seriously is his work in preserving the environment.
   He said people used to dismiss him ``as a crank'' because of his
outspokenness on environmental issues.
   Noting that ecology is now a prime worldwide concern, the prince
smiled and said, ``Now, I'm going to go on talking about it. ...
I'm not stopping just because it's become a political issue, I can
assure you. And I'm going to go on even more because now at last
there's an audience.''
   He told CBS News correspondent Selina Scott that he has
gradually gained more confidence in his personal judgment.
   ``I was never certain that the feelings I had were worth
expressing. But now, I feel much more determined about them, and I
think it's probably something that happens to you when you reach
40,'' he said.
   He said he has to maintain his sense of humor and is aware that
as many people come to gawk at him as to listen to his views when
he speaks.
   Asked by Scott if he laughed at himself, the prince replied, ``I
do try. God! Well, plenty of people laugh at me. That's why I often
try to, you know, to poke fun at myself because I actually think
... it's a way of helping people to realize that you're human.''
