mile during a track meet in Oxford, England, in 3:59:04 minutes.

USS Ethan Allen fired a Polaris missile armed with a nuclear
warhead that detonated above the Pacific Ocean.
   In 1978, ``Affirmed,'' ridden by Steve Cauthen, won the 104th
Kentucky Derby, the first leg of an eventual Triple Crown victory
the year after ``Seattle Slew'' also won the Triple Crown.
   In 1980, the bodies of eight Americans killed in the aborted
mission to rescue the hostages in Iran were flown to the United
States from Tehran by way of Switzerland.
   In 1983, West German government experts announced that tests had

   Five years ago: Voters in El Salvador went to the polls for the
second time in six weeks, this time to decide a presidential runoff
between Jose Napoleon Duarte and Roberto d'Aubuisson. Duarte would
emerge the winner.

Ronald Reagan said he didn't ``look kindly upon'' reports that a
memoir written by his former chief of staff, Donald Regan, painted
an unflattering portrait of first lady Nancy Reagan.
   Today's birthdays: Actor Stewart Granger is 76. Baseball great
