   A man who claims his family was given most
of the northern United States by the king of England during
colonial times has sued to get it back.
   Robert Brewster, of Longmont, Colo., said in his U.S. District
Court lawsuit, filed in Cheyenne, that he wants the land to set up
his own country for blue- and green-eyed people.
   Brewster claimed his family was given the land between the 40th
and 48th north latitudes from ocean to ocean. The 48th parallel is
approximately at the Canadian border and the 40th parallel
stretches approximately from Eureka, Calif., across the United
States to New York City.
   ``It is now necessary for the Brewsters to reclaim their land
before the federal government loses its ability to return the
land,'' the lawsuit said. ``The USA has lost its vision and is
collapsing every day with newspapers reporting each morning of
massive land purchases by Japan or OPEC.''
   The lawsuit filed Monday said Brewster is a descendant of
William Brewster, a founder of the Plymouth Colony in 1620 in what
is now Massachusetts.
   The lawsuit said William Brewster and his companions were given
the land by the King of England when they left that country to move
to the ``New World.''
   Brewster said he wants the land back so he can ``form an area
where only green-eyed and blue-eyed persons will be permitted.''
People with green and blue eyes are superior to those with brown
eyes, Brewster said, but will soon be extinct unless they are
protected.
   Brewster also asked the court for permission to establish a
standing army to protect the borders of his country.
   The United States, as represented by the U.S. Attorney's office
in Cheyenne, has 30 days to respond to Brewster's lawsuit,
according to a woman in the U.S. District Court clerk's office. She
said Wednesday that the case has been assigned to Judge Alan B.
Johnson, but no hearing date has been set.
