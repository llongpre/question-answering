Peter O'Toole joins previously-cast John Goodman in Universal's "King Ralph," 
scheduled to film in the U.K. in mid-April. The comedy's based on a novel, 
"Headlong," by the late Welsh actor-writer Emlyn Williams, which has the entire 
Royal Family wiped out in an electrical storm during the photographing of a 
family portrait. A trace of the royal bloodline leads to Goodman, a Las Vegas 
lounge pianist. O'Toole will play royal secretary to the new, improbable King 
of England. David S. Ward writes and directs. Then, in July, Goodman reunites 
with filmmakers Ethan and Joel Coen for "Barton Fink," a '40s murder mystery in 
which Goodman will play a Hollywood screenwriter from Kansas City. He last 
worked with the writing-producing-directing Coen brothers team on "Raising 
Arizona." . . .

Isabella Rossellini has landed the lead role in Imagine Entertainment's "Closet 
Land," written and to be directed by Radha Bharadwaj, a Temple University film 
school grad with TV credits in her native India. The script, originally 
developed at the Sundance Institute, is an intense drama that takes place in 
one room with a man interviewing a female prisoner. Because of its anti-torture 
theme, Amnesty International is reportedly supporting the script in Hollywood. 
The film, produced by Janet Meyers, will start production by or before May.

Goldhirsch, begins filming in May for Castle Rock/Nelson Entertainment. 
Columbia will release.

Exotic locations: Producer Jeffrey Sneller will soon find himself producing 
films virtually at opposite ends of the globe. First comes "The Ice Runner," 
rolling April 30 in Murmansk, U.S.S.R., near the Finnish border, under the 
direction of James Fargo. Timothy Bottoms stars as a CIA agent imprisoned in 
the Soviet gulag in 1986; Pat Morita plays a Mongolian trader. Negotiations are 
under way with Rod Steiger and Joanna Pacula for the other key roles. Four 
Seasons will handle U.S. distribution. . . . Then in June, Sneller and producer 
Raju Patel launch production in Africa on Sneller's own adaptation of Joseph 
Conrad's journey into colonialist depravity, "Heart of Darkness." Michael 
Wadleigh, best known for "Woodstock" and "Wolfen," will direct the Allied 
Entertainment production. Negotiations are under way with Liam Neeson to play 
the main protagonist, Marlow. Filming will take place in Kenya, Zaire, Uganda 
and Zimbabwe. . . .

Also filming in Africa -- in Burundi, a country which has never before 
witnessed Western film making -- is "Snake Eyes." Malcolm McDowell, Sydney 
Penny, Lois Chiles, French star Philippe Leotard and Jason Cairns star in this 
modern-day fable for Jaques SandozFilm Prods. At $5.5 million, the film is said 
to be the most expensive Swiss-backed film ever.

Moshe Mizrahicq, whose directing career in Israel and France has resulted in 
three Oscar nominations for best foreign film, including the Oscar-winning 
"Madame Rosa," has come to L.A. to prepare for his first American film. 
"Paradise Man," to shoot this fall mostly in New York (with some locations in 
France), is based on a detective novel by Jerome Charyn, an American writer 
more celebrated in France than here. Casting for Rosa/Guy Prods. will get under 
way in a few weeks. KIRK HONEYCUTT
