   Archaeologists have unearthed the 14th century
remains of King Edward II's palace where he relaxed with his
homosexual lover before being deposed by his wife and murdered, as
tradition has it, with a red hot poker.
   The archaeologists have also found on the same London site the
remains of a house owned by Sir John Fastolf, thought to have been
the model for William Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff.
   Falstaff, the hard-drinking, knight-turned-robber, is one of the
great comic creations of English literature.
   The London Museum hailed the find of enormous historical
importance but a member of its archaeological team, Michael
Hammerson, said that under terms of an agreement with a
construction company, the museum must halt its work sometime this
fall. After that, bulldozers will move in to clear the site.
   ``The most important thing now is to record the exact details
before the site is destroyed,'' he said.
   Hammerson said that the developers, St. Martin's Development
Corp., had sponsored the archaeological work.
   The remains of the palace and Fastolf's house were discovered on
a construction site at Hayes Wharf on the south bank of the River
Thames where St. Martin's wants to build offices and apartments.
   A large stone corner of the palace was unearthed last week but
the archaeologists tried to keep the find quiet for fear of
attracting treasure hunters, said the The Times of London which
reported the find Friday.
   The Times said St. Martin's is also wary of publicity because
its development plan is already the subject of an official public
inquiry to decide whether or not it should go ahead.
   The palace was a large moated building covering about 80 square
yards. Known to historians as the ``Rosary,'' it was a retreat on
the far side of the Thames where the king could escape the cares of
office.
   The paper quoted historian Dr. Colin Lucas of Oxford University
as saying this was where Edward enjoyed a reign of dissolution with
his male lover, Piers Gaveston, before being deposed and murdered
at Berkeley Castle in western England in 1327.
   Edward was born in 1284, the son of King Edward I by his Spanish
first wife, Eleanor of Castile. His father trained the prince in
warfare and statecraft but the son acquired habits of extravagance
and frivolity which he retained throughout his life.
   Edward I attributed his son's attitude to the influence of his
French friend Gaveston, a Gascogny knight, and drove the Frenchman
into exile. But when Edward I died in 1307, his son's first act on
becoming king was to bring back to England the man he called his
``brother Piers.''
   Gaveston acted as regent in control of the realm when Edward
went to France to marry Isabella, daughter of the French king
Philip IV, in 1308. She was to bear the king two sons and two
daughters.
   Edward's barons grew indignant over Gaveston's influence and
twice insisted on his banishment. But on each occasion, Edward soon
recalled his friend.
   The barons finally went to war against the king and Gaveston,
killing Gaveston and forcing Edward to stand aside while a baronial
committee took over the government.
   In 1327, Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer deposed Edward.
He was imprisoned and one of his sons was chosen as king.
   Tradition has it Edward was murdered with a red hot poker.
   The palace is mentioned in the 19th century antiquarian study,
``A History of the King's Works,'' and an illustration of the site
appears in a map by the 16th century cartographer Ralph Agas.
   Shakespeare is believed to have modeled Falstaff, a rambunctious
lover of life who appears in both the ``King Henry IV'' plays and
``The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' on Fastolf.
   But The Times said the discovery near the house of jetties and
inlets suggested Fastolf in fact was not much like the character
the Elizabethan playwright created.
   ``There are far more docking installations than we had
suspected. The evidence suggests that he was an important
merchant'' and therefore not a knight, Hammerson said.
   The Times said Fastolf built the house in 1446.
   It said the finds at the site of the house were known to include
large amounts of leatherwork, pewter ware and a tall felt hat.
