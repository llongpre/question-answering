   Today is Saturday, April 23, the 114th day of 1988. There are
252 days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   April 23, 1564 is the generally accepted birthdate of the
English poet and dramatist William Shakespeare. He died on the same
date 52 years later.
   On this date:
   In 1348, King Edward III of England established the Order of the
Garter.
   In 1789, President-elect George Washington and his wife moved
into the first executive mansion, the Franklin House, in New York.
   In 1791, the 15th U.S. President, James Buchanan, was born in
Franklin County, Pa.
   In 1896, the ``Vitascope'' system for projecting movies onto a
screen was demonstrated at a music hall in New York City.
   In 1940, about 200 people died in a dance hall fire in Natchez,
Miss.
   In 1954, Hank Aaron of the Milwaukee Braves hit the first of his
record 755 major-league home runs, in a game against the St. Louis
Cardinals. (The Braves won the game, 7-5.)
   In 1968, the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United
Brethren Church merged to form the United Methodist Church.
   In 1969, Sirhan Sirhan was sentenced to death for the
assassination of New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. (The sentence was
later reduced to life imprisonment.)
   In 1985, the Coca-Cola Co. announced it was changing the secret
flavor formula for Coke, the world's best-selling soft-drink.
(Adverse public reaction forced the company to resume selling the
original version.)
   Ten years ago: For the second time in two days, Pope Paul VI
publicly expressed hope that the kidnappers of former Italian Prime
Minister Aldo Moro would spare his life. (Moro, however, was found
murdered May 9.)
   Five years ago: President and Mrs. Reagan solemnly welcomed home
the bodies of 16 of the Americans killed in the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Beirut during ceremonies at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington.
   One year ago: Twenty-eight construction workers were killed when
an apartment complex being built in Bridgeport, Conn., suddenly
collapsed.
   Today's Birthdays: Actress Janet Blair is 67. Former actress and
U.S. ambassador Shirley Temple Black is 60. Fashion designer

Symms (R-Idaho) is 50. Actor David Birney is 49. Actor Lee Majors

Irish nationalist Bernadette Devlin McAliskey is 41. Actress Joyce

   Thought for Today: ``Time is like a fashionable host,
   That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
   And with his arms outstretched, as he would fly,
   Grasps in the corner: welcome ever smiles,
   And farewell goes out sighing.'' -- From Troilus and Cressida,
   Act Three, scene three, by William Shakespeare (1564-1616).
