<LEADPARA>  Norway's King Olav V, the world's oldest reigning monarch, died Thursday after
suffering a heart attack, according to a statement from the royal palace. He
was 87.;    The king, who suffered a stroke in June, was a British-born Dane
who became the second monarch of modern Norway. His ancestry was firmly rooted
among the blue bloods of Europe, but the Norwegians called him "Folkekongen"
-- the People's King.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NORWAY'S KING OLAV V DIES AT AGE 87
RULER WAS OLDEST REIGNING MONARCH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     An only child, groomed for the throne since the age of 2, he became a
rallying point for his adopted compatriots during World War II and, as king, a
beloved symbol of nationhood.;    The palace said he is to be succeeded by his
son, Crown Prince Harald V, who becomes the first Norwegian monarch born in
Norway since 1370.;    After his extraordinarily active life, Olav died as the
world's oldest reigning monarch, a status he gained after the death in January
1989 of Japan's Emperor Hirohito.;    From his youth as an Olympic yachtsman
and excellent ski jumper to his elder years as Norway's representative on
dozens of state visits, Olav maintained an unflagging pace.;    On May 28, the
day before he was hospitalized with a heart complaint, Olav visited Narvik in
northern Norway, joining in the 50th anniversary celebration of the first
Allied victory in World War II.;    "I have chosen a certain openness, and I
have the impression that people appreciate that," he once said.;    He was
born Prince Alexander Edward Christian Frederick on July 2, 1903, in Appleton
House on the British royal estate of Sandringham in Norfolk, England, of a
Danish prince and an English princess.;    Parliament chose his father, Prince
Carl, to stand for election in 1905 to the new throne when Norway's union with
Sweden was dissolved. When he won, Carl took the name Haakon VII and named his
son Olav. The names harked back to kings of Norway's rich Viking past.;   
Olav was a great-grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark, known as "the
father-in-law of Europe" because of his descendants' connections with most of
the royal houses of Europe. His mother was Queen Maud, youngest daughter of
King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of Great Britain.;    Olav married his
first cousin, Princess Martha of Sweden, March 21, 1929, but liked to joke
that he became so thoroughly Norwegian that his son and two daughters married
Norwegian commoners.;    A close adviser to his father, the crown prince gave
the king his full support when, from their hideaway in northern Norway near
the Swedish border during World War II, Haakon unequivocally rejected a demand
of occupying Nazi Germans for a government headed by Vidkun Quisling, whose
name became a synonym for traitor.;    After the underground Council of State
rejected Olav's request to stay behind to oversee the anti-Nazi resistance,
he, his father and the government went to England on June 7, 1940.;    On the
fifth anniversary of their departure, Haakon came back to free Norway.;   
Haakon died Sept. 21, 1957, and Olav became king.;    Princess Martha died in
1954 and Olav never remarried. They had three children: Princess Ragnhild
Alexandra, Princess Astrid Maud Ingeborg, and Harald.  </TEXT>
