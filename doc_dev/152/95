<HEAD>Bush to Use George Washington's Inaugural Bible</HEAD>

   The Bible used for George Washington's
swearing-in 200 years ago was put aboard a train Thursday for
Washington, where George Bush will use it for his oath of office.
   A four-member honor guard of Free and Accepted Masons carried the
King James Bible printed in 1767.
   The Masons of St. John's Lodge lent the Bible to Presidents
Warren G. Harding, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter for their
inaugurations, said Allan Boudreau, director of the lodge-sponsored
Livingston Library and Museum.
   New York City was the capital of the new nation when George
Washington, a member of a Masonic lodge in Virginia, was inaugurated
here April 30, 1789. His oath was administered by Robert R.
Livingston, chancellor of New York state and the Masonic grand
master.
   The Bible originally contained a portrait of England's King
George II. A picture of Washington was added in the mid-1800's, said
Boudreau.
   ``It's in pretty good shape. It's been restored and carefully
tended to over the years,'' he said.
   The Bible will be on exhibit in the White House until Jan. 20,
then escorted by Masonic honor guard to the inauguration ceremonies.
