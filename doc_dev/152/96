GREENE KING, the south of England's largest regional brewer, yesterday
launched a Pounds 101.3m hostile bid for Morland, its Oxfordshire-based
rival.
The offer, triggered by the Whitbread Investment Company's need to reduce
its holdings in regional brewers to comply with the government's beer
orders, was immediately rejected as inadequate by Morland.
WIC was Morland's biggest shareholder with a 43.4 per cent holding. It is
selling a 28.5 per cent stake to Greene King for Pounds 27.23m cash and has
agreed to accept the offer for its remaining 14.9 per cent if there is no
higher bidder.
Sir Humphrey Prideaux, Morland's chairman, warned shareholders that WIC was
'a forced seller . . . influenced by motives that are not relevant to other
shareholders'.
He added that WIC had to reduce its stake in Morland by November to ensure
that its associate brewer, Whitbread, did not have to free more of its pubs
from tied beer supplies.
Speculation now surrounds the future of two more brewers, Marston, in which
WIC has a 31.4 per cent stake and Brakspear, where Whitbread has a 27 per
cent holding.
Greene King, which had tried for nearly three months to agree merger terms
with Morland, is offering nine new convertible preference shares for every
two Morland shares, equivalent to about 477p a share. There is a cash
alternative of 450p.
The paper offer represents a 47 per cent premium on the Morland share price
in February when talks began and an exit multiple of 21 times Morland's 1991
earnings.
Morland's shares closed at 458p, down 27p while Greene King fell 7p to close
at 507p.
Mr Simon Redman, Greene King's chairman, said that a merger made commercial
and financial sense in the changing conditions of the beer market.
'Morland faces strategic difficulties as a small independent company, with
neither the strength of brands nor the critical mass to become an efficient
low cost producer,' he said. 'Greene King is the natural merger partner,
with an excellent fit between our trading areas and similar business
cultures.'
Mr Redman estimated that the acquisition would lead to cost savings and
improved margins which should benefit trading profits of the enlarged group
by an initial Pounds 2.5m a year.
The combined estate of more than 1,100 pubs would enable Greene King to
consolidate its position in southern England where its Abbot and IPA brands
already command a 20 per cent share of the market for cask conditioned ale.
Greene King would close Morland's Abingdon brewery, with a loss of about 100
jobs, early next year and convert the site to a distribution depot, Mr
Redman said. The future of Morland's beer brands, Old Speckled Hen and
Morland's Original, would be reviewed.
Greene King recorded a marginal decline in interim pre-tax profits to
November last year of Pounds 10.9m. Bad free trade debts and higher interest
charges depressed earnings.
Morland, which bought 100 pubs from Courage last year, increased interim
profits to March 31 of Pounds 3.06m a rise of 30 per cent.
