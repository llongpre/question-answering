   Actor Robert Duvall has prepared himself for
roles by hanging out with bums on the Bowery, riding horses with
the Texas Rangers and tramping through a Louisiana swamp with an
alligator hunter.
   He's not sure if it was all worth it.
   ``You could do all the research in the world _ sometimes it pays
off, sometimes it doesn't,'' Duvall says in the March issue of
Smart magazine. ``Sometimes you don't have time. You got to be a
human being up there. That's the most important thing.''
   Duvall, who won an Oscar for ``Tender Mercies'' and starred in
``The Godfather'' and ``The Great Santini,'' says he's a stickler
for detail in his characters and in films in general.
   ``When actors start acting bigger than life, bigger than the
people they play, then they're in trouble,'' Duvall said. ``For
example, I can't even talk about `Gone With the Wind.' You don't
see people in the South like that. It's a joke.''

   Two queens, Elizabeth II and Beatrix, are Europe's
wealthiest women, although the English monarch with an estimated
personal fortune of $8.9 billion far outranks her Dutch
counterpart, a magazine said Sunday.
   Britian's Queen Elizabeth is the fourth richest person and the
richest woman in the world, reported Harpers and Queen magazine.
She has a jewelery collection including 25 crowns and tiaras,
racing horses, a valuable art collection and thousands of acres of
land and mineral rights worldwide.
   Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands weighed in at an estimated $4.7
billion.
   Johanna Quandt, who owns 66 percent of the West German
automotive company BMW, is Europe's third richest woman, the
magazine said. It estimated Ms. Quandt's fortune at $3.5 billion.
   Another German, Grete Schickedanz, owner of Quelle, Europe's
largest mail order company, is Europe's fourth wealthiest woman at
$2 billion, the magazine said.
   Athina Roussel, the 5-year-old daughter of the late shipping
heiress Christina Onassis and French pharmaceutical heir Thierry
Roussel, is No. 7 on the list, although Harpers and Queen said she
will not take control of her $840 million fortune until her 18th
birthday, in 2003.
   Forbes' list of the world's richest people published in October
listed Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who made his money in land,
railroads and resorts, as the world's richest individual worth
about $15 billion.
   The Sultan of Brunei and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia have been
reported by Fortune magazine to have more money at their personal
disposal because of the oil riches of their countries. Estimates of
the sultan's wealth have ranged up to $30 billion and Fahd's is
said to be in the $18 billion range.

   Comedian Milton Berle is selling his
longtime home here because it contains too many memories of his
late wife.
   ``I didn't have to sell the house,'' Berle said. ``But there are
too many memories there, you know, after being married 36 years.''
   The 81-year-old comic is negotiating to lease a penthouse on
Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles for $12,000 a month. The house
sold for more than $3 million cash to the owners of a mortgage
company.
   The 60-year-old home went on the block in October following the
death of Berle's wife, Ruth, in April. They had lived in the house
for 19 years.
   Berle had asked $3.65 million, but apparently the property needs
work.
   ``It has a lot of character but needs updating, and that's what
the buyers plan to do,'' said Yaffa Lerner, who sold the house.

   Pulitzer Prize winning author James
Michener has bought a summer home in Brunswick, and plans to move
there late this spring, a real estate broker says.
   ``He wanted to have access to a college library for research and
where it would be cool in the summer,'' said Brunswick broker
Deborah Morton.
   Michener, who has written such books as ``Hawaii,'' ``Alaska,''
``Caribbean'' and ``Space,'' began house hunting last fall and
found a condominium unit, but the deal was not closed until
Thursday, Ms. Morton said. She would not disclose the price.
   The 82-year-old author is known for his historical novels, which
combine history, geography and cultures of different regions. While
researching his books, Michener often moves to the area he is
writing about.

   Journalist Tony Brown told a
predominantly black audience that American blacks are crippled by a
self-imposed ``psychological slavery'' that keeps them from
achieving success.
   Brown said blacks are held captive by a myth: ``If white America
doesn't provide an opportunity for them, they won't have one.''
   ``You are psychologically dependent on someone else,'' Brown
told about 500 people at the annual fund-raising dinner of the
state chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People on Saturday night.
   Brown, host of the black affairs television series ``Tony
Brown's Journal,'' said the civil rights movement has brought
changes in laws that were needed to give blacks an equal footing.
   But it takes more than legislation to reverse a 200-year-old
mind-set of inferiority that plagues many in the black community,
Brown said. He urged blacks to take pride in their African identity
and not wait for others to help them reach their economic and
social goals.
   ``If we want to be equal, let's be equal,'' he said. ``We don't
need anybody to give us freedom.''
   Brown also writes a column that appears in 150 black newspapers,
publishes a quarterly magazine, and produces documentary films.
