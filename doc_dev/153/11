   Queen Elizabeth II, believed to be the world's
richest woman, grumbles about the price she has to pay for her
clothes and is happier wearing a pair of comfortable old shoes,
according to her favorite couturier.
   Sir Hardy Amies says in the May 23 issue of the Woman's Own
weekly that the queen is not a ``clothes person.''
   The designer, who will be 81 in July, is Dressmaker by
Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen, a title granted by Buckingham
Palace.
   ``She grumbles about our prices, drops hints and things, but she
has been told ... that those are the prices,'' Amies said.
   He said the queen often ignores his advice.
   ``She doesn't care, basically. She listens to our advice, then
goes off and wears shabby shoes because they're comfortable.
   ``In my opinion that is perfectly all right. It's only the hoi
polloi who criticize,'' he said.
   Princess Anne, the queen's daughter, ``won't pay our prices and
she's happy with the way she dresses,'' said Amies.
