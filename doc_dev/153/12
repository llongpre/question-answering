<LEADPARA>  IT MIGHT interest Americans to recall that Queen Elizabeth, who will be
visiting the United States in May, is the richest woman in the world
(according to the new Charles Higham-Roy Moseley book "Elizabeth and
Philip").;    Will the queen visit her cotton plantation in Scott, Miss.? It
is known as the Delta and Pine Land Company, and consists of 38,000 acres of
rich soil, a factory and a mill. It was worth about $44 million back in 1968.
In Texas, will she visit the wealthy Standard-Oil-of-New-Jersey heir, William
S. Farish? She visited Farish and his wife soon after the Falklands War at
their beautiful farm and estate in Kentucky. (This Texas millionaire and the
queen have horse breeding in common.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>   BRIDAL SEARCH: Phoebe Cates (Mrs. Kevin Kline) was all set for the role of
the blushing, virginal, newlywed-to-be in the Charles Shyer-Nancy Myers remake
of the MGM classic, "Father of the Bride." (This team did "Baby Boom" and
"Private Benjamin.") Then Mother Nature stepped in. Cates became pregnant, but
her agents thought she could play the part before this became evident. The
producers didn't agree. So Cates is now out of the movie and her replacement
is still being sought.;    From what I hear, blushing, virginal young things
are hard to find in Hollywood. Reps for the film have even gone to England to
look, with no success. It seems most young actresses these days dress and look
so sophisticated, so polished, so "tough" if you will, that even the truly
virginal among them seem to have been "through the mill.";    According to
Sandollar producer Howard Rosenman, this remake will be a straight update of
the 1950 original. Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are to play the Spencer
Tracy-Joan Bennett roles. Martin Short will be the supercilious "wedding
coordinator." And whatever sweet young thing takes over from Cates will have
the burdensome knowledge that she is doing a role Elizabeth Taylor made
famous.;    Actually, in 1950, Taylor was a virginal young thing.  </TEXT>
