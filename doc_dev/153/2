<TEXT>     The oil-rich Sultan of Brunei remains the wealthiest man for the fifth
straight year with a $31 billion hoard, the magazine estimates. Britain's
Queen Elizabeth II is the richest woman with $10.7 billion.;   Still, the
slowing world economy had an impact on the Fortune ranking, which appears in
the business glossy's Sept. 9 editions, which go on sale Monday. Twenty-six
names on the list last year were gone, supplanted by a surge of new arrivals.;
  Newcomers to the list include GAF Corp. owner and former federal prosecutor
Samuel Heyman of New York, with $1.5 billion, and the Gap clothing chain
founders Donald and Doris Fisher of San Francisco with $1.9 billion.;   Two
other Bay Area residents made the list: San Franciscan Gordon Peter Getty, who
with his brother John Paul Getty ranked 30th with $3.8 billion, and David
Packard and family of Los Altos Hills, who ranked 90th with $1.9 billion.; THE
