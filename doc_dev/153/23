   A spokesman for Prince Turki bin Abdul
Aziz of Saudi Arabia would like you to know the prince is a fairly
regular guy.
   Even if he owns several homes and palaces, has a staff of 4,000
and belongs to the second-richest family in the world.
   With an entourage of nearly 100 people and a tractor-trailer
filled with luggage, that's a tough sell when you pull into a hotel
_ as the royal family did here four weeks ago _ at a cost of about
$10,000 a day.
   Fact and fantasy quickly become blurred.
   Take, for example, the story of a Cambridge police officer on
the special security detail who said that Turki ordered the air
conditioning turned off on the two floors he took over on arriving
at the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square.
   ``They like to keep it like it is in their country. All the cops
working up there are dying,'' said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``A kid told us they even had a space
heater up there.''
   For Mustapha Aziz, the prince's political adviser and spokesman,
the reaction is typical to princes from oil-rich nations such as
Saudi Arabia, under scrutiny since American and other troops were
sent there following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``No, the air-conditioning is not off,'' Aziz said. ``That kind
of stereotype is too much.
   ``Everyone thinks we are coming here with many wives, that kind
of thing. It does not apply to this family. ... He is out of that
picture of greedy princes.''
   Still, the 53-year-old prince's penchant for frequent travel and
long stays at expensive hotels is unusual.
   The youngest of King Fahd's six brothers, Turki has no business
dealings, lives off his inheritance and does largely philanthropic
work. He travels with a staff of 60 to 100, including seven cooks.
The costs of about 40 to 50 rooms at the Charles to house workers
and set up offices with facsimile machines, telephones and a
satellite dish may exceed $10,000.
   Aziz said that is not a big entourage for a member of the Fahd
family, which is worth $18 billion and is the second richest-family
in the world, according to Fortune magazine. ``We have three full
shifts,'' he said.
   Another police officer said the prince, who has his own security
detail, also hired two dozen Cambridge officers at $200 per day.
   ``That's for each man,'' said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``And he's got about eight Harvard cops and
some other guys.''
   The officer said when the prince's 11-year-old son wanted to
play video games one day, he was escorted to an arcade by four
police officers.
   ``The kid had $300 in quarters with him,'' he added.
   Aziz could not confirm or deny those reports. Nor could he hide
his irritation.
   ``The prince does not like to show off. He gives hundreds of
donations every month, but he refuses to be identified as the man
who gave it. His is not the Trump style,'' said Aziz.
   Aziz said that had the Iraqi invasion not occurred, few would
have known he was in town to discuss contributions to Harvard and
have his three children get medical checkups.
   At a recent news conference to discuss events in the Mideast,
the prince was affable but unassuming. But the breakfast he offered
for reporters was certainly one befitting a prince.
   There was cheese _ brie, camembert, saga blue and port salut; a
dozen fruits; six fruit juices; smoked salmon with caviar; petit
filet mignon; Belgium waffles; poached eggs on pumpernickel muffin
with basil hollandaise; two preparation stations for egg dishes,
and a full Mideast menu.
   Waiters presented a long-stemmed red rose to each woman in
attendance. And it was all set off by 750 orchids.
   Like her husband, Princess Hend wore Western clothes.
   She made headlines years ago when she got in a melee with police
checking out reports of mistreatment of workers at the prince's
home in Florida. That's the house where the family created a stir
with a lavish birthday party for his son that included a cake
topped off with live flamingos.
   At one point in the news conference, the princess, whose English
is good, interrupted to say the translator had mangled the exchange
between a reporter and the prince. He tried again.
   ``Her royal highness is the type who likes to speak her mind.
Everyone in the media try to harm this image,'' said Aziz. ``She is
the type of woman for our future.''
