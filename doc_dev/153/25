   The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations is in town for it 22nd meeting and the streets are
bedecked with bunting, so why do the decorations feature the number
43 instead of 22?
   Because the bunting isn't for the delegates; it's for the sultan,
who turns 43 on July 15.
   The sultan, who has 37 words in his name and title, is worth $30
billion and takes very good care of the 241,000 people over whom he
has absolute sway.
   He is Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan and Yang
Di-Pertuan Negeri Brunei Awang Muda Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'issaddin
Waddaulah Ibni Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan
Awang Muda Omar Ali Aifuddin Saifuddin Sa'adul Khairi Waddin.
   Most people just call him Sir Hassanal Bolkiah.
   His sultanate, 2,226 square miles on the north coast of Borneo,
sits on a huge pool of oil and natural gas.
   The Guinness Book of World Records says Sir Hassanal is the
world's richest individual becauwe oil income and foreign currency
reserves totaling almost $30 billion are ``effectively at his
disposal.''
   Fortune magazine confirmed his enormous wealth and said King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia was second with $18 billion.
   Secular, religious and military power rest with the sultan, a
hereditary ruler who is head of state, prime minister, defense
minister and commander of the armed forces.
   One of his brothers is in charge of foreign affairs and another
heads the Finance Ministry of this former British protectorate,
which became fully independent five years ago.
   As well as being the richest person in the world, Sir Hassanal
lives with his relatives in the world's biggest palace _ a complex
of buildings built with 38 types of marble on a 300-acre hill near
the Brunei River.
   In case friends decide to stay over, it has 1,778 rooms and 257
toilets. There are 564 chandeliers, 18 elevators, 44 staircases and
a banquet hall that seats 4,000.
   His majesty's polo ponies have air-conditioned quarters.
   More than 2,000 workers completed the Istana (palace) Nurul Imam
for independence in 1984 and the sultan never said how much it cost.
Guesses at the time started at $250 million, but suppliers who know
what went into it _ including 22-carat gold tiles on interior arches
_ say at least $600 million.
   The sultan has two wives. He was married first to Her Majesty the
Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha and then to Her Royal Highness
Pengiran Isteri Hajjah Mariam. He has three sons and six daughters.
Saleha, the sultan's first cousin, resides in the Nurul Imam.
   Mariam (born Mariam Bell) keeps house in a smaller and newer
palace, Nurulizza, 14 miles from the capital. Their marriage caused
a rift between the sultan and his father, Sir Omar, because she was
a commoner and part Japanese. Japan occupied Brunei during World War
II. The sultan met Mariam when she was a hostess on the Royal Brunei
Airlines.
   The royal family, in power for 29 generations, ensures continued
support for autocracy by providing subsidized food, fuel, housing
and free education and medical care. There is no personal income tax.
   Shortly after independence, Sir Hassanal was quoted as saying his
subjects enjoyed ``a good life. Why should they want more?''
   Bruneians seem content. The happiest probably are the civil
servants, who make up 46 percent of the work force of 85,000. Along
with standard benefits, they get free pensions and interest-free
loans to buy cars and houses.
   Traffic jams are common in Brunei, which has one car for every
2.3 people.
   Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, the foreign minister, told reporters
covering the conference: ``The people seem to be very happy with the
way we are running things. The people accept it.''
   They certainly are spared worries that trouble the foreigners
here assembled. There is no national debt, no trade deficit, no
balance of payments problem and the budget always shows a surplus.
Oil and natural gas account for 99 percent of exports.
   Sir Hassanal was attending Sandhurst Military College in Britain
when his father abdicated in 1967 and he was summoned home at age 21
to take the throne.
   Sultan Omar continued to run things from behind the scenes for
another 15 years, however, and the polo-playing young potentate took
the opportunity to build an international reputation as a playboy.
   Brunei's last flirtation with an elected parliament was in 1962,
when it was still a British protectorate.
   The Parti Rakyat Brunei, since outlawed, won all 16 seats on the
Legislative Council. Sultan Omar refused to convene the council and
an uprising ensued.
   Britain crushed the rebellion and a state of emergency declared
at the time remains in force.
