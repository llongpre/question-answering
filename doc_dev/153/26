   A hitherto unknown relative of Queen Elizabeth II
has placed one foot out of obscurity, claiming his father was the
product of an illicit love affair between a dashing aristocrat and
a lady-in-waiting, a blueblood chronicler says.
   The relative is a 49-year-old engineer whose first name is
Anthony. He lives with his wife and two teen-age children in a
modest three-bedroom house in a suburb of Manchester in northern
England. But that's all he wants the public to know.
   Anthony says he is the queen's second cousin, once removed, and
according to Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's
Peerage, ``he is her closest illegitimate documented relative.''
   Brooks-Baker said Anthony's grandfather was Charles Bowes-Lyon,
a first cousin of the queen's mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth.
   ``Anthony wants his family to be included in Burke's Peerage
along with his noble ancestors,'' Brooks-Baker said. ``He wants his
children to be received by the Bowes-Lyon family.''
   He stepped forward when Burke's Peerage, known as the blueblood
bible, announced a year ago that it intended to begin listing the
illegitimate offspring of nobility and royalty in future editions.
   Burke's Peerage authenticated Anthony's royal links through his
birth certificate, letters and photographs, but respected his wish
to remain anonymous.
   Anthony feared public recognition might destroy his family's
quiet lifestyle and has asked to be listed as ``The Unknown
Royal,'' Brooks-Baker said.
   Britain's tabloid newspapers have offered him up to $85,000 for
exclusive rights to his story, but Anthony has refused,
Brooks-Baker said.
   ``He has refused all monies,'' Brooks-Baker said. ``He is an
unbelievably shy man and is far from rich, but he has no problems
financially.''
   In 1908, Bowes-Lyon, a second lieutenant in the British army,
``fell passionately in love with this attractive woman who was a
sort of companion to his aunt'' at the family's stately home,
Ridley Hall, in northeast England, Brooks-Baker said.
   A year later, they had a child and asked permission to marry,
``but a marriage between somebody of that station and a
lady-in-waiting was really out of the question,'' he said.
   Bowes-Lyon was sent to Canada for three years ``to recover from
this great love,'' and the mother and child went to live at her
family's home in Cheshire in northwest England, he said.
   The child, Charles, was registered as a Lindsay, the
lieutenant's mother's maiden surname.
   Brooks-Baker said Bowes-Lyon's love for the woman never faded,
and that he possibly planned to marry her. But World War I
intervened, and he was killed in battle in France on Oct. 23, 1914.
   Illegitimate children ``cannot claim their full share of an
inheritance'' but the Bowes-Lyon family ``looked after the child,''
Brooks-Baker said.
   They paid for his schooling and, when he turned 18, sent his
mother 600 pounds (then about $2,700) in Canadian railway stocks to
help him set up in business.
   ``That is one of the best examples I know of the aristocratic
tradition of accepting illegitimacy in an understanding and
Christian way,'' Brooks-Baker said.
   Charles later married and had a son, Anthony. He ended up a
shopkeeper in the English Midlands, where he died in 1976.
   Brooks-Baker said the Bowes-Lyon family gathered Friday to
discuss Anthony's claim to his past and ``there's no question about
anyone denying it.''
