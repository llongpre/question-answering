   British actress Jane Seymour says she found
much to admire in Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee who became
the duchess of Windsor, the woman the English loved to hate.
   ``She was the woman who stole their king,'' says Seymour, who
portrays Simpson in the CBS movie, ``The Woman He Loved.''
   ``They hated her. She was a naive American who didn't understand
the monarchy or how it worked or what it stood for. She thought
David could make her his queen.''
   Instead, David, already King Edward VIII but not yet crowned,
was forced to abdicate in 1936 to marry Wallis. They became the
duke and duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in
exile.
   The two-hour movie, which CBS will televise on Sunday, also
stars Anthony Andrews as David, Olivia de Havilland as Wallis' Aunt
Bessie, Julie Harris as her mother, Lucy Gutteridge as another
woman who saw herself as David's queen, Robert Hardy as Winston
Churchill and Phyllis Calvert as Queen Mary.
   ``I've never heard anyone say a good word about her,'' Seymour
says. ``Other than that, she gave great dinner parties. But I liked
her. She had a sense of humor, a straightforwardness. She was
definitely attentive to her husband and, although she was no
beauty, she had style and elegance. I certainly wouldn't trust her
with my husband.
   ``It's boring to play a perfect person. But to play a woman who
was not liked and to find something about her that is likeable is
fascinating.''
   Seymour says she saw David as a weak man who never really wanted
to be king. Wallis Simpson fulfilled some of his needs.
   ``Rumor has it that Wallis learned to do sexual tricks when she
lived in China,'' she says. ``The king had a few problems in that
area and she fixed them.''
   When Wallis first met David, he was the prince of Wales and she
was married to American businessman Ernest Simpson. The flirtation
turned to romance, and Simpson's marriage to divorce. Her plan was
to marry David and become queen, but the British prime minister and
royal family forbade his marriage as king to a twice-divorced woman.
   ``The Woman He Loved'' takes a different and less political
approach than the British-made miniseries ``Edward and Mrs.
Simpson,'' which ran on PBS several years ago.
   English newspapers became heavily involved with the making of
``The Woman He Loved'' and Seymour says one paper seemed to give
royal status to her role-playing. The Times published Seymour's
picture as the duchess at David's funeral. It went on the Court
Circular Page, a serious chronicle of royal events.
   ``I tried to play her in various shades of gray,'' Seymour says.
``I play her the way I believe she was thinking at the time. She
was manipulating things. She had a great plan and it didn't work. I
purposely don't play her sympathetically.''
   Parts of the movie were filmed in western England, where Seymour
owns a 15th-century estate outside the old Roman spa city of Bath.
She stayed at her home, St. Catherine's Court, during that time.
   Seymour divides her time between England, where she is still a
citizen, and this country, where she has lived for the past 10
years. She and her husband, American businessman David Flynn, have
two children, Katie, 5, born here, and Sean, 2, born in England.
   She works mostly in American television and films, having shed
her English accent in order to play American roles.
   Seymour was on her way to Spain to play opera star Maria Callas
in the ABC miniseries ``Onassis: The Richest Man in the World.''
The four-hour miniseries, which tells of the romance between Callas
and Greek magnate Aristotle Onassis (Raul Julia), will be televised
in early May.
   She has already completed her role as Natalie Jastrow Henry in
``War and Remembrance,'' the 30-hour miniseries being readied for
ABC next season. So far she has starred in 10 American miniseries.
   ``This seems to be my `duchess and diva' period,'' she says with
a laugh. ``I seem to be getting some great roles now. It's very
exciting. I'm like a chameleon, changing the way I look, the way I
sound, the kind of roles I play.''
   She took over the role played by Ali MacGraw in ``The Winds of
War,'' the first of author Herman Wouk's two massive novels on
World War II.
   For her role as Maria Callas she had to learn to sing several
arias. She also worked with dialect coach Robert Easton for her
roles as Wallis Simpson and Maria Callas.
   Next, she goes to London for a role in the CBS miniseries ``Jack
the Ripper.'' She plays the romantic interest to Michael Caine, who
stars as Scotland Yard Inspector Frederick Abberline. Armand
Assante also stars as an American actor playing ``Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde'' on the London stage at the time of Jack the Ripper's
reign of terror.
