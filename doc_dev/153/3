<LEADPARA>  Queen Elizabeth II, one of the world's richest women, pays no income tax. A
large majority of Britons think that's wrong, by one poll, and legislator
Simon Hughes is trying to do something about it.;    Hughes planned to present
a bill in the House of Commons today proposing that the queen pay income taxes
levied on all of her considerable assets, the exact value of which are kept
secret.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Liberal Democrat's bill apparently stands no chance of becoming law
because both the Conservative government and the leadership of the opposition
Labor Party oppose it. They don't want to upset the monarchy or its
supporters.;    But the bill was expected to test parliamentary opinion on an
issue that has attracted much media attention.;    Conservative legislator
Anthony Beaumont-Dark, Labor legislator Brian Wilson and Hughes called in an
Independent Television program last week for the queen to pay taxes.;    The
rest of the royal family pays taxes.;    An opinion poll published by The
Independent on Sunday some weeks ago said 79 percent of 1,090 Britons
questioned in February thought the queen should be taxed. The newspaper gave
no margin of error.;    Hughes estimates the Treasury could raise $11.2
million a year if the queen's income were taxed. He told the British
Broadcasting Corp. in a radio program Tuesday: "It is completely unfair that
the richest woman in Britain should be exempt.";    Buckingham Palace
officials say the queen's fortune, which includes jewel and art collections,
race horses and real estate, is a private matter. Media estimates of its worth
vary widely.;    The British magazine Harpers and Queen in February named her
as the world's richest woman with assets of $10.5 billion. Fortune magazine
estimated the value of her investments alone at the end of the 1980s at $3.5
billion.;    But the Independent said today it was a myth that she has
billions invested. It said palace officials were content with estimates
valuing her investments at $192 million.;    A survey by the Independent today
said that elsewhere in Europe, the Spanish, Swedish, Belgian and Dutch royal
families all pay tax on their private fortunes. It said only the Norwegian and
Danish monarchies do not pay taxes, but they are among the royal families on
the continent with the fewest holdings.;    The queen's defenders say she
already contributes to the Exchequer through her Crown Estates, which include
farmland and London real estate, officially valued at nearly $3.8 billion last
year.  </TEXT>
