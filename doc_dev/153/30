   A man ranked the wealthiest
in the world runs this tiny oil-rich Moslem kingdom, and diplomats
report little dissent from people unencumbered by income taxes,
medical payments or tuition fees.
   King Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah rules the enclave on the
northeastern tip of Borneo from his 1,788-room palace. Earlier this
month, Fortune magazine called him the richest man in the world,
worth $25 billion.
   Citizens of this southeast Asian nation do not appear to object
to the king's rule because he spreads some of the money around.
   ``They (the people) are well looked after, with free education,
medical treatment, cheap housing, good pensions and any one doing
well in his studies can easily get a university education abroad at
the government's expense,'' said one diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He said there are no beggars, and about half the workforce is
employed by the government. The per capita income is estimated at
about $18,000, one of the highest in the world, according to
bankers and diplomats.
   All the money comes from oil and gas, which Brunei exports
mainly to Japan.
   A Brunei government official said recently that 1986 exports
amounted to $2.03 billion _ 99 percent of it oil and gas. Imports
for the same year totaled $785 million in cars, foodstuffs and
other goods.
   The nation, about the size of Delaware, covers just 2,226 square
miles, much of which is not suitable for cultivation, an
agricultural officer said.
   Without daily newspapers, the nation's 227,000 people get their
news mainly through state-run radio, Television Brunei and some
government publications.
   An official in the Planning Unit said Malays form the majority
of Brunei's population, but there are also about 60,000 Chinese and
other non-Malays.
   About 87,000 people are employed and of these 28,000 are foreign
workers, including foreign maids, doctors, lawyers, engineers,
accountants and others.
   Brunei has no elected Parliament and Sultan Bolkiah rules the
nation with the help of a Cabinet comprising two of his brothers
and about seven other people.
   The 41-year-old monarch, who studied in neighboring Malaysia
before a stint at the British Military Academy in Sandhurst,
England, in 1966, was crowned the 29th King of Brunei in 1967 by
his father Sir Omar Ali Saifuddin, who abdicated in favor of his
son.
   The king loves polo and has about 200 Argentine polo ponies,
some of which are kept in air-conditioned stables. He has two wives
and six children.
   In the 14th and 15th century, Brunei was a large empire
stretching from the northern Philippines to most parts of Borneo,
but when the colonialists came Brunei shrank. Brunei became a
British protectorate in 1906 and won its independence on Dec. 31,
1983.
   The country has no income tax, gasoline is cheap and there are
no major taxes on cars, which are imported from Japan and
elsewhere. Diplomats estimate foreign reserves at $20 billion.
   The King has powers to detain and hold without trial anyone
deemed to be a threat to the security of the nation. On July 14,
the government released 34 such detainees, leaving just six still
in custody.
   Diplomats say there appears to be no long-term threat to
Brunei's economy as the 120,000 barrels of oil being pumped daily
is expected to last ``well into the next century''.
   Brunei is officially known as Brunei Darusalam.
   Darusalam means abode of peace ``and there is indeed peace
here'' said a diplomat, who added ``they could have added
prosperity to it.''
