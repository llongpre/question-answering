   The Sultan of Brunei, one of the world's wealthiest men, has agreed to buy the legendary Beverly Hills Hotel from oil tycoon Marvin Davis for more than $200 million, hotel sources said. 

   Mr. Davis purchased the Beverly Hills Hotel, also known as the Pink Palace for its distinctive coloring and its star-studded clientele, from the family of Ivan F. Boesky and others for about $135 million last December. 
The sale followed Mr. Boesky's $100 million settlement of insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

   The hotel sources said Mr. Davis and the Sultan of Brunei have agreed on a price, and the transaction is expected to close sometime next week. 

   Mr. Davis couldn't be reached, and spokesmen for him declined to comment. 

   The purchase of the posh hotel was the jewel in Mr. Davis's growing block of Los Angeles real estate and restored some of the glamour the investor gave up by selling Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. to Rupert Murdoch. 
Mr. Davis also said, after he bought the hotel, that the purchase had personal meaning, because he spent his honeymoon in the hotel and once lived in one of its bungalows. 

   Since the purchase of the hotel, Mr. Davis has frequently presided over breakfasts in the hotel's Polo Lounge, a popular breakfast locale for the entertainment industry. 

   Hotel sources also said they understood the sultan was reportedly a losing bidder in the December sale of the hotel but persisted in trying to buy the hotel from Mr. Davis. 
"The guy finally came back with a price that was so far and away unbelievable that (Mr. Davis) just had to say OK," said one hotel source, adding, "Marvin has a deep personal attachment to the place." 

   Another factor in Mr. Davis's decision to sell the 75-year-old hotel was his discovery that renovation costs would be higher than originally estimated, according to the source. 
Michael Ullman, the hotel's general manager, has said the hotel was planning "substantial renovations" and even the addition of a nightclub. 
Many of the hotel's competitors, including the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, are being renovated. 

   A price-tag for the hotel of more than $200 million wouldn't make a very big dent in the net worth of the sultan. 
In its current issue, Fortune magazine pronounced him the world's richest man, estimating his personal net worth at $25 billion or more. 
The sultan, who rules Brunei, a tiny country on the oil-rich island of Borneo, lives in a 1,788-room palace and owns more than 200 polo ponies, according to the story. 

   The sultan couldn't be reached for comment. 

   The hotel wouldn't be the sultan's first. 
He snapped up London's elegant Dorchester Hotel 2 1/2 years ago for a price that wasn't disclosed from Regent International Hotels of Hong Kong. 
A hotel spokeswoman at the time said the price paid was "certainly in excess" of the $52 million that Regent had paid for the Hyde Park property less than a year earlier. 

   The sultan entered the national spotlight earlier this year when the congressional investigation into the Iran-Contra affair revealed that he had contributed $10 million to the Contra rebels at the request of the Reagan administration. 
That contribution was eventually returned to the Sultan after it was deposited in the wrong Swiss bank account.
