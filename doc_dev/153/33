   Sweden's biggest private fortune was
built on a better milk carton, according to a new survey of wealth
in a country that discourages high incomes.
   The survey, published Wednesday by Affarsvarlden (Business
World), showed the four wealthiest families have left Sweden and
relocated their companies abroad to avoid a tax system designed to
equalize personal income.
   However, the magazine said its list of multimillionaires has
grown from 26 to 163 since its first survey six years ago.
   Thirty-one families were listed as having assets worth more than
one billion kronor. Three families would qualify as billionaires in
dollars. A dollar is worth just under six krona.
   The wealthiest family is headed by Hans and Gad Rausing, the
sons of Ruben Rousing who began producing milk cartons in 1952, and
in 1963 gave the world a flat-topped carton that can be packed and
shipped like bricks.
   Tetra Pak, the company at the base of the family fortune, has
its head office in Switzerland. The Rousing brothers, said the
magazine, are worth up to 30 billion kronor, or $5 billion.
   Second on the list is the family of Ingvar Kamprad who founded
IKEA, a chain store selling cheap do-it-yourself furniture and
accessories.
   Peter Wallenberg, head of Sweden's best known industrial family,
ranked 64th on the list. One distant relative was Raoul Wallenberg,
the diplomat who saved 100.000 Hungarian Jews from Nazi
extermination camps during World War II. He was arrested by the
Soviet army during final days of the war and disappeared.
   King Carl XVI Gustaf just squeezed onto the list in 158th place
with estimated assets of about 100 million kronor, or $16.6 million.
   Sweden's newest billionaire is Per Arwidsson, 35, who took a
small loan from a bank eight years ago and parlayed it into a
fortune on the stock market, the magazine said. He was 31st on the
list.
   Senior Editor Bjorn Franzon said the list was difficult to
compile fairly. ``We tried to evaluate the market value of the
family holdings in listed companies,'' he told the Associated Press.
   ``The situation is a little tricky. We are talking about family
equity because we don't care if the owner has transferred some or
all of his shares to one son or five sons ... for tax purposes,''
said Franzon.
   Most Swedes pay about half their wages in taxes, and the
marginal tax rate on top income brackets goes up to 75 percent.
Inheritance tax can amount to 100 percent, and even more, of an
estate.
   Franzon said the magazine's first survey of the super-rich was
in 1982 when the Social Democrats, who ran Sweden for 50 years,
were returned to power after six years of non-socialist government.
   The quantum leap in the length of the list was only partly due
to the government's economic policy, he said.
   That policy encourages business profits while heavily taxing
private income. Employee benefits and tax-financed government
welfare programs give Swedish workers one of the world's highest
standards of living.
   The growing number of millionaires could be attributed to a real
estate and stock market boom, despite the crash last October, and
by inflation, which pushed up the nominal value of the companies,
Franzon said.
   He acknowledged his earlier list was not as accurate as it
should have been.
   ``I'm a little ashamed to say that our journalism also is
better. We have better resources ... and a better understanding of
the companies,'' he said.
   ``We have 40 or 50 people on the list this time who should have
been on before, but it wasn't possible to find them,'' the editor
added.
   Antonia Ax:son-Johnson, 45, is the only woman listed as head of
a wealthy family, with assets of up to 2.4 billion kronor, or $400
million. She spells her name in a disappearing form of Swedish
abreviation, but the company she inherited is known as
Axelson-Johnson AB, a trading and investment firm which last month
Sweden's largest department store chain to its holdings.
   Franzon said the list is still incomplete, and the magazine has
more to learn. ``My guess is that an accurate list should have many
more real estate people,'' he said.
   Affarsvarlden, a weekly first published in 1901, has a
circulation of 25,000.
