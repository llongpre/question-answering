   Queen Elizabeth II joined 400th anniversary
celebrations Tuesday of the first Welsh-language Bible, a
translation ordered by her namesake, Elizabeth I.
   The queen participated in a bilingual service at Westminster
Abbey in honor of the 1588 translation as well as an upcoming Bible
which has taken Welsh scholars 26 years to complete.
   She accepted a copy of the 1588 Bible and thanked God ``for the
blessing that his book has been for the Welsh people,'' as 1,500
Welsh and English dignitaries looked on.
   Welsh is still taught in schools in Wales but the number of
native speakers has declined to 64 percent in Welsh-speaking areas
this year from 71.3 percent in 1981, a recent survey has found.
   Wales was brought under English rule in 1282 by King Edward I and
united with England in 1536.

   Former star skier Erika Hess and her
husband are expecting a baby next month, a Swiss magazine reported
Tuesday.
   ``Maybe it will be a Christmas baby,'' Hess, 26, was quoted as
telling Schweizer Illustrierte magazine. The baby is expected Dec.
22 to Dec. 25, she said.
   The magazine featured pictures of Hess and her husband, Jacques
Reymond, outdoors near their home in the Jura Mountains and a photo
of the mother-to-be sitting on a rocking chair indoors, knitting a
sweater for the baby.
   Hess retired from skiing in 1987, after 10 years of competition
during which she won two overall World Cup championships. She
crowned her career with two gold medals in the 1987 Alpine World
Championship.
   Last May she married Reymond, 38, a former trainer for the Swiss
women's ski team.

   United Farm Workers President Cesar
Chavez was in the hospital Tuesday as a result of a weekend accident
in which he fell eight feet from a porch and fractured his right
wrist, a union spokesman said.
   Chavez was working at home Sunday at UFW headquarters in Keene
when the hand rail on his porch gave way, his son Paul Chavez said.
Besides the fractured wrist, the union leader also sustained bruises
to his head, chest and back, his son said.
   ``He's doing fine awaiting test results,'' said John Theilen, a
second UFW spokesman.
   Chavez, 62, has been recuperating from a 36-day-long water-only
fast he ended Aug. 21. Chavez fasted to protest pesticides used in
California agriculture and called for a boycott of table grapes.

   The teen-age brother of pop music star
Madonna has been charged with aggravated assault for allegedly
biting a youth's nose at a party.
   Mario Gerard Ciccone, 19, who has been charged with assault in
four separate incidents this year, pleaded innocent Monday.
   The charge stemmed from an Aug. 8 house party at which a
16-year-old boy said he was bitten after allegedly flirting with
Ciccone's girlfriend. The youth received treatment after the wound
became infected.
   Last month, Ciccone was cleared of assault for allegedly slamming
a door in the face of a police officer investigating a loud party.
He faces two other, unrelated assault charges.
