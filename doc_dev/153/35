WHEN THE richest man in the world issues a dinner invitation, it is best to
be punctual. The sultan of Brunei, estimated to be worth a cool Dollars 37bn
(Pounds 20.7bn) at the last count, was throwing a little anniversary bash
marking his 25 years on the throne.
Dinner was at 7.30. At 5.30, a few select members of the international media
arrived at the palace gates. The sultan is known to be a bit of a stickler
when it comes to dress. Slept-in suits were brushed down. Scuffed shoes were
given a quick wipe. Stained ties were adjusted. The man from Russian TV
looked in need of a snort of vodka.
It was going to be a cosy affair. Just us, the sultan, a sprinkling of Malay
royalty, a layer of heads of state, a few prime ministers added as garnish.
Plus a few thousand other dignitaries, even a few ordinary people. A mere
5,750 altogether, all seated in the same room.
You either hide your wealth or flaunt it. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, 29th
sultan and absolute ruler of Brunei, is not afraid of spending a bob or two.
His palace is described as the biggest in the world. There are nearly 2,000
rooms. There is a throne room that can seat 2,000. Marble covers more than
12 acres of wall. Carpets as lush as newly-fallen snow. Chandeliers that
weigh a ton apiece. Gold that hurts the eyes. Nearly 300 lavatories.
The meal was running late. No one can raise a fork until the sultan gives
the word. We waited. The dining room was a cross between Versailles and high
season at Butlins.
'G'day,' said an Australian waiter, one of more than 700 catering staff
flown in for the occasion. 'Not a bad little party, eh?'
In the kitchens, chefs sweltered and tempers frayed. Plates of prawns
collided with sides of mutton. The meat for the meal was flown in from
Australia where the sultan's ranch is twice the size of Brunei itself.
More waiting. A few of the down top table guests sloped in. Prince Edward -
representing his mother, Britain's Queen Elizabeth - sat in the corner by
the royal serving hatch. A Thai prince smiled serenely at the ceiling. A
Malay princess adjusted a troublesome tiara.
The sultan, still only in his mid-40s, has two wives and 10 children. And a
great deal else besides. Two palaces in Brunei plus a hotel in Singapore and
another which he bought, then sold, to the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), a
secretive organisation that handles an estimated Dollars 35bn of the
country's international investments.
The sultan has a mansion in Malaysia. He owns the Beverly Hills hotel in the
US, plus another couple of houses in Tinseltown.
His father was something of an anglophile who even had a special Winston
Churchill museum built in Brunei. That has been closed but the present
sultan - who spent time at Sandhurst, England's military college for
officers - still maintains strong British links.
He bought the Dorchester hotel in London but sold it recently to the BIA.
There are various flats and houses dotted round the British capital. The
sultan's main residence is a country house situated on the flight path to
Heathrow airport.
The sultan is partial to planes. He bought his own 747 recently and has a
couple of other jets in Brunei. Then there are the automobiles: estimates of
the number of his Rolls-Royces vary between 135 and 157. Plus a whole
starting grid of sports cars.
Dinner was getting very late. There were ugly mutterings from the
international press. No alcohol allowed in this increasingly Islamic state.
Diplomats, dressed in their full regalia, perspired quietly; their wives
glowed.
The sultan loves polo. He flies in whole teams to play special tournaments.
His horses are said to have air-conditioned stables.
Britain has a battalion of Gurkhas stationed in Brunei. The sultan has his
own Gurkha battalion, made up of retired soldiers who now form the palace
guard. Any mutinous sounds from the waiting diners and the kukris might be
out.
Army chaps were the only ones to maintain stiff upper lips throughout the
long wait. They would not even taste a tumbler of water until the sultan -
always referred-to among expatriates as 'HRH' - had first lifted a glass.
It was 9.45 pm when the sultan finally arrived. The whole family was in
attendance. The sultan doubles up as prime minister and minister of defence.
A brother is foreign minister, another is minister of finance.
Sultan, princes, princesses and prime ministers sat down, stock still. Not a
word was spoken. Just the sound of a thousand camera shutters clicking.
The press were ordered back to table. The sultan had given the word. Food
was fallen on. The Russian fantasised about the cold of a Moscow winter.
'And then you drink - like that,' he said, knocking back a pineapple juice.
We rose. 'Tut, tut,' said the army. Dammit all, everyone has to wait till
HRH has finished. We escaped through the kitchens.
'You people have no bloody decorum,' said the Australian waiter, smiling. We
agreed. Six hours of dinner was enough, even if it was with the richest man
in the world.
