   Warplanes rumble overhead. Bombs whistle down and
explode, shaking the floor. Thick smoke wafts over the wreckage and
a woman's screams mingle with the reassuring tones of a Cockney air
raid warden.
   It's ``The Blitz Experience,'' a vivid museum display that gives
post-World War II generations a taste of London under German
bombardment.
   As those who lived through the 1940-42 bombing of London can
attest, ``The Blitz Experience'' is unnerving. The smoke smells
real, the ground really does shake, and the sounds are authentic
wartime recordings.
   ``The Blitz Experience,'' the centerpiece of the Imperial War
Museum's $31 million redevelopment, begins in a brick shelter like
those in which thousands of Britons cowered during air raids.
   For seven minutes, mostly in chilly darkness when the single
storm lantern is blown out, visitors listen to a raid launched in
the fall of 1940.
   ``If you lived in our street you'd have been in here, 12 hours a
night, night after night,'' says the recorded voice of George
Barker, a Cockney grocer who doubled as an air raid warden,
patrolling the streets in a tin hat, and who lost his shop to a bomb.
   There are moments of humor, in tribute to the legendary spirit of
the Londoners under siege, such as Barker remarking that a shop
whose front was blown up ``put out this big sign. Know what it says?
`More open than usual.'''
   Those on the recording sing ``Roll out the Barrel,'' breaking off
as a woman screams when a bomb explodes close by.
   When the all-clear siren sounds, Barker ushers everyone out,
saying: ``Let's see what Jerry's (the Germans) left us.''
   A man named Albert, who disdains the shelter and ``always sleeps
behind the bar,'' groans in the wreckage of his pub but is pulled
out alive.
   The London skyline is red with fire, an unexploded bomb lies
nearby, the firefighters are running out of water.
   ``Our house _ it ain't there,'' a woman says.
   A little boy hunts for his toys. His mother is heard coaxing him
away from the wreckage, promising him new toys.
   ``It's our job to make the terror, the horror and the sacrifice
as real to people who, we hope, will never experience it as those
who did,'' said the museum's director, Alan Borg.
   The Blitz, he said, has been mythologized by nostalgia. ``It
wasn't fun, and one of the aims of our experience is to show that it
must have been a terrifying thing to live through,'' he said.
   ``It's no good being serious and boring about it and saying
`you've got to listen to me!' I've got to get people in and say,
`this is interesting, come and see!' And then hopefully they'll
think about it.''
   Queen Elizabeth II, who served in the wartime Auxiliary
Territorial Service and whose Buckingham Palace home was bombed in
1940, will visit ``The Blitz Experience'' Thursday when she
officially opens the redeveloped museum.
   The museum arose from a government decision in March 1917 to
collect and display material from World War I.
   It is housed _ appropriately, some say _ in the building that was
the 19th century mental hospital known as Bedlam.
   Its extraordinary relics include caltrops, a sabotage instrument
with four spikes used by the ancient Romans and resurrected in World
War I to damage the feet of men and horses.
   Besides little tins labeled ``Queen Mary's Comforts for the
Troops'' from World War I _ needles and cotton, cigarettes and candy
_ there are guns and gas masks, tanks and two-man submarines,
uniforms and medals, fighter planes suspended from the ceiling,
100,000 books and the world's best war art collection of 12,000
paintings and drawings.
   Next year, it plans to open ``The Trench Experience,'' which will
expose visitors to the mud and smells of a World War I fighting
front.
