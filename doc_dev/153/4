   The world has 32 new billionaires this year,
according to a list compiled by Fortune magazine, including indicted
junk-bond chieftan Michael R. Milken and a Taiwanese tycoon with
holdings in insurance, hotels and soy sauce companies.
   Meanwhile, the same five individuals or families who topped last
year's list also lead the 1989 ranking, the magazine reports in its
Sept. 11 edition, due on newsstands today.
   The list swelled to 157 members this year with the addition of 32
members, although five others fell off the ranking. The list
includes individuals and nuclear families with net worth Fortune
estimates at $1 billion or more.
   Taiwanese investor Tsai Wan-Lin, 64, joined the list at the No. 6
spot. The former poor farmer saw his 65 percent stake in Cathay Life
Insurance in Taipei skyrocket in value and his net worth increase to
$9 billion as the Taiwan stock market took off, Fortune said.
   Milken, 43, who faces trial on federal charges that he violated
securities laws, joined the list at No. 125, with an estimated
fortune of $1.2 billion.
   The Sultan of Brunei, who presides over the small oil-rich nation
near the South China Sea, is still the world's wealthiest man with
an estimated fortune of $25 billion, the magazine stated.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and his family are next with $18
billion, followed by Forrest E. Mars Sr. and the Mars candy-bar
clan, who are estimated to be worth $12.5 billion.
   Ranked fourth after the Mars family was the world's richest
woman, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, who is worth an estimated $10.9
billion compared with $8.7 billion last year, Fortune reported.
   Fifth on the list were New York-based publishing magnates Samuel
I. Newhouse Jr. and Donald E. Newhouse, worth an estimated $10
billion.
   Wal-Mart Stores mogul Sam Moore Walton, of Bentonville, Ark., was
seventh with $8.9 billion; the Reichmann brothers _ Albert, Paul and
Ralph _ whose Ontario-based Olympia &amp; York is the largest owner of
New York City commercial real estate, are eighth with $8.4 billion;
British real estate tycoon Gerald Grosvenor is ninth with $6.9
billion; and Kenneth Roy Thomson, who controls Canada's Thomson
Newspapers Ltd., was ranked No. 10 with estimated wealth of $6.9
billion.
   Among other newcomers are Carl C. Icahn, the takeover strategist
who also is chairman and chief stockholder of Trans World Airlines
Inc. and worth an estimated $1.2 billion; Turner Broadcasting System
Chairman Ted Turner, $1.3 billion; Kirk Kerkorian, helped by the
sale this year of MGM-UA Communications Co., $1.1 billion; and
Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon Inc., $3.2 billion.
   Of those on the list, there are 58 in the United States, 54 in
Europe, 23 in Asia, including 11 Japanese, and 22 others.
