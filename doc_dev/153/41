<HEAD>Poll Says 82 Percent Of Britons Support Monarchy</HEAD>

   Four out of five Britons remain firmly royalist but
nearly 60 percent think Queen Elizabeth II should step down to allow
her eldest son Prince Charles to become king, according to an
opinion poll published today.
   The Gallup poll, published in The Daily Telegraph newspaper,
reported 82 percent of those questioned said they were in favor of
the British monarchy, just 14 percent wanted it abolished and the
rest expressed no opinion.
   But 59 percent said they thought the 62-year-old queen should
``retire'' early, allowing 40-year-old Charles to become king.
   Because of the disgrace surrounding the abdication in 1936 of the
queen's uncle King Edward VIII, later the Duke of Windsor, in order
to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, the queen has said she
will never abdicate the throne.
   This could mean a long wait for Charles. His
great-great-grandfather, King Edward VII, had to wait until he was
59 years old before he succeeded to the thone in 1901 on the death
of his mother, Queen Victoria, at age 81.
   Charles, whose concern for the poor, homeless and what he regards
as the uglier aspects of modern architecture have won him widespread
public support, heads the list of most popular royals, according to
the poll. It said 21 percent of those questioned said Charles was
their favorite.
   A 75-minute television documentary made by the prince attacking
many modern buildings as ugly was screened by the British
Broadcasting Corp. on Oct. 28. A newspaper survey at the time said
75 percent of Britons agreed with him.
   In today's poll, 19 percent of respondents said Elizabeth the
Queen Mother, Charles' 88-year-old grandmother, was their favorite;
17 percent favored his 38-year-old sister Princess Anne; 12 percent
liked his 27-year-old wife Princess Diana best; and 11 percent liked
the queen most.
   Despite the overwhelming support for the monarchy, 40 percent of
presondents said they thought the $9.45 million in taxpayers' money
paid last year to support the royals was too much.
   The queen, one of the world's richest people, has a personal
fortune estimated earlier this year by the London business
publication Money Magazine at $6 billion. But she and some other
royals also receive an annual grant of taxpayers' money voted by
Parliament to help them with the cost of their official duties,
upkeep of palaces and other expenses.
   Asked whether they themselves would want to be members of the
royal family, 89 percent of those questioned in the poll said no.
   The poll was based on interviews with 918 people around Britain.
It stated no margin of error.
