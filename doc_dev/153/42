THE WEALTHY go shopping at Sainsbury, believe themselves to be excluded from
a London or university based upper-class establishment and claim that most
important decisions are taken by men in the family.
The results of a survey of 70 of Britain's richest families published
yesterday at the British Association annual meeting show that many rich
people perceive themselves to be just like everybody else.
Leicester University, which published the findings, interviewed with
Midlands families deriving fortunes from new and old money. The families,
from landed gentry to captains of industry and commerce, each had at least
Pounds 250,000 in liquid assets. Several were worth tens of millions of
pounds.
Professor John Scott, in charge of the project, said that most of those
interviewed believed themselves to be middle class whatever the size of
their fortune.
Many claimed their biggest extravagance was their weekly Sainsbury's
shopping bill or going out for a meal. This was in spite of the fact that
they might own a yacht, jet aircraft or private stables.
Many complained they were excluded from an upper class establishment 'either
because it was London based or because entry depended upon a university
education', said Prof Scott.
Women were less content than men. Only five of the 70 families had women
heading their business activities; in the others, almost all key decisions
were taken by men.
Yet many women had played an important role in founding family fortunes
either through their work or by providing the initial capital. One woman
told the study: 'It was his dream, my money.'
Businessmen, in spite of their natural desire to hand down their wealth,
displayed a surprising lack of concern about passing on their companies to
their children.
Many took the view that the next generation had the right to pursue its own
path and that their businesses might do better under the control of
non-family members, said Prof Scott.
As a result, many owners planned to sell their businesses when they retired
although landed families were determined to keep their estates intact.
