"I've always been a liar -- it runs in my family," begins Sarah Baylis' 
brilliant and biting novel, "Utrillo's Mother." Capturing our attention and 
imagination while failing speculation as to the veracity of her story, Baylis 
recounts in a series of flashbacks a fictionalized biography of 
Marie-Clementine (Suzanne) Valadon (1865/7-1938). 
</P>
<P>
The mother of Utrillo, she was a talented post-Impressionist artist in a period 
when the art world was experiencing tremendous growth and upheaval, though it 
remained almost exclusively a male domain. 
</P>
<P>
Baylis writes about art and politics, women and sex, oppression, freedom, 
self-expression and social stigma from an ardently feminist perspective. Her 
vision is frank and refreshing, sparing neither the sacred cows of 
Impressionism nor our preconceptions of their world as portrayed in their 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Baylis' protagonist is brash. She acts without regret or apology. She sells 
herself time and again, yet survives on her own terms. We may blush at her 
audacious conduct but admire her courage and conviction. Her desire to paint, 
to draw, to be an artist overwhelms all else. She sleeps with artists to learn 
their technique, models for others to steal tubes of paint or drawing pads. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is multidimensional. Political and social events helped to inspire 
the new art and bring on the rejection of the standards of the Academie des 
Beaux Arts. Turn-of-the-century artists were caught up in the spirit of 
revolution which led them to strike out in new directions and experiment with 
new ideas: Impressionism, Pointillism, Symbolism. Much of the descriptive 
narrative involves the events of the revolution of 1860, the Paris Commune, the 
Prussian War, the turn-of-the-century Parisian cafe society. Baylis gives us 
characters which bring to life the period: the beautiful baker's daughter who 
paints slogans, the lesbian waitress who introduces Valadon to the seedy 
underground. Baylis' descriptions are luscious and earthy, giving us not only 
sights and sounds but the odors and the emotional fervor of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
This historical context is equally important in establishing the role of women, 
and thus the basis for Valadon's outrage at the injustice she suffers. Baylis 
gives a brutal description of the lives of the working-class women of the time 
-- their backbreaking menial work, their constant fear of starvation and 
poverty, the very hopelessness of their plight. 
</P>
<P>
It is with this reference point that Baylis critiques so strongly Watteau, 
Fragonard, Renoir and other artists in their rose-tinted portrayals of 
shepherdesses and washerwomen: "Washerwomen were the rage. . . . Contemptible 
in real life, they were now almost respectable in fine art . . . but where 
slavery exists in a civilized society it must be quickly romanticized, or else 
there will be complaints, petitions, fuss and bother . . . and we'll all be 
waiting until domesday for our collars and cuffs. The same painted tradition 
that had transformed the shepherdess from a dung-smeared illiterate into a 
beribboned picnicker changed the lowly washerwoman from a tippler to a giggling 
cutie." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on another level, the novel is atemporal. Valadon's feelings are too real, 
too natural: We identify too easily with her fantasies and with her struggle. 
Questions of sexual politics, of woman's role in society -- these are questions 
that are valid today in our society. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins with Valadon as an old woman, looking back on her childhood on 
a farm where she lived with her mother, Madeleine. Her mother is called 
Madeleine throughout the book, possibly indicating the tense and angry nature 
of the mother/daughter relationship: "We were tied together by poverty and 
kinship, hating both and loathing each other, eaten up by love and guilt." 
</P>
<P>
The farm is described in detail, a dark and dirty place seen through the eyes 
of an unhappy child. In one episode, there is an encounter with a Gypsy, and we 
see immediately the scene through the eyes of the artist: "I wish I could have 
painted her like that -- I would have made her green brown, then outlined her 
hands with a strong black line and all the colours of her clothes would be rich 
and sombre against the turbulent grass." 
</P>
<P>
Having revolted against her insulting and obnoxious employer, Madeleine is 
forced to leave, and with child in tow, heads for the city, hoping to improve 
her lot. Their lot does not improve. Madeleine finds another menial job and 
sends Valadon off to a convent school: "The place reeked of suppressed sex and 
the girls were infected by it. We were the most obscene creatures; pornography 
was scrawled on the toilet walls and swear words, picked up from our brothers 
and fathers were the cornerstone of our language -- alongside that 
cannibalistic butcherspeak that religious people use." 
</P>
<P>
After the convent, Valadon holds a series of jobs -- in a hat factory, then in 
a restaurant where she becomes a waitress and a pickpocket: "I loved thieving, 
it was my chief satisfaction. They had so much it wouldn't be missed. They were 
rich old cows in fancy hats and fox furs, who despised me. They deserved to be 
inconvenienced." 
</P>
<P>
After the restaurant, a vegetable stand, then, taking a 50-year-old clown as 
her lover, a job with the circus. It is at the circus that she meets Theo, her 
first artist, and she becomes involved with him and his world, learning from 
his work and eventually becoming a model. She models for Renoir and Chavannes, 
all the while drawing and painting furiously on her own. The transition from 
model to artist of some renown is gradual. She meets Degas, whom she considers 
brilliant: "He was called a misogynist, too. If a painter portrays a woman as 
she is, that painter will be called a misogynist, a hater of women. 
</P>
<P>
For to portray women with truthfulness is to suggest that you accept them as 
they are, and that is the most dangerous thing you can do in the world. Just 
think of it! If women are ever accepted as they are -- exhausted, possessed, 
angry and bartered . . . then the world will have to change in every single 
particle." Valadon ignores the critics and continues her art but is finally 
betrayed by her femininity -- she gets pregnant and the son she bears marks 
forever her destiny: "Never encourage your son to pick up a brush and dabble 
with painting, within a few months they'll say he has outstripped you . . . 
they'll do anything to hold a woman back, even use her poor drunken son to 
betray her. . . . Christ, it's hurtful this endless punishment of being mother 
to a painter." There are more liaisons -- a banker, a painter, and eventually 
some fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Although today she is recognized as a gifted artist, a modern reference book 
refers to Valadon's work as "violent." If this be the case, certainly Baylis 
has created a biography that would explain the violent nature of her work. More 
important, Baylis' rich prose brings to life a vibrant and impassioned 
character -- a character whose ideas are as truthful and vital in 1989 as they 
were 100 years ago.
