   Capt. Rob Hertberg jinks his F-16D
tactical fighter into a series of wrenching turns, levels off and
streaks over his target at 525 m.p.h.
   ``Boom! We got it,'' Hertberg, 29, tells his backseat passenger,
seconds after snapping the 15-ton U.S. Air Force fighter into a
steep, banking climb away from the target.
   Hertberg, under agreement with the Air Force, took an Associated
Press reporter on board for a look at the type of low-level
training mission that has become extremely controversial in West
Germany.
   As the jet rolls out of a hard 90-degree turn, Hertberg quickly
brings it down low over the village-flecked plains and bogs of
northern West Germany.
   Back in formation, Hertberg and his wingman, Capt. Keith Sage,
skim over treetops at an altitude of 500 feet and at speeds
approaching 575 m.p.h. as they head back to the 496th Tactical
Fighter Squadron's base near Hahn in southwestern Germany's Eifel
mountains.
   The attack was a drill, the type that OTTEN TIMBERLAKE=

   ``I will use my name,'' His Grace
said. ``I will use it ruthlessly.''
   His name is Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the sixth Duke of
Westminster and reputedly Britain's richest man, and he said he'll
lend it to a good cause.
   The 37-year-old aristocrat was standing on what he considered to
be a good cause _ the site of an industrial estate. He's doing his
bit to help the local development corporation attract American
investors.
   ``If you are given a lot, I think you should give a lot back,''
said the duke, who spends about one-third of his time supporting
150 charities.
   He says it springs from a sense of duty: ``We still have a lot
to do with those who have been left behind in the march toward
prosperity.''
   It's also a sort of insurance against those British radicals who
would regard the duke as a child of archaic privilege. In these
egalitarian times, it's important for aristocrats, from royalty
downward, to be seen working for the common good.
   But he is no apologist for the aristocracy.
   ``There is a class system wherever you go in the world. We just
have handles on our names to identify our pecking order better.''
   In the pecking order he is also the Marquess of Westminster,
Earl Grosvenor, Viscount Belgrave, Baron Grosvenor and 15th Baronet
of Eaton.
   The boyish, energetic duke is tall, medium-built, and for his
outing to Warrington he wore a conservative suit and the British
aristocracy's obligatory gold pinky ring. His basset-hound eyes are
very blue. His eyebrows meet at the bridge of his nose.
   Laughing in frequent short bursts, he is casual and friendly,
obviously well-practiced at putting the overawed at ease with
one-liners.
   He speaks with an updated version of the upper-class British
accent, laced with occasional Americanisms, like ``you guys.''
   The Grosvenor family fortune is estimated by London's Sunday
Times to be worth $5 billion, surpassed only by Queen Elizabeth
II's $8.7 billion.
   It owns 300 acres of London's elegant Mayfair and Belgravia
districts, including the plot on which the U.S. Embassy stands.
   Back in 1677, it was all cabbage patch and swamp, the dowry of
Mary Davies, the 12-year-old bride of Sir Thomas Grosvenor.
   The estate also owns pieces of Scotland, Vancouver in British
Columbia and Hawaii, a sheep station near Wagga Wagga, Australia,
and extensive property outside Chester in northwest England, where
stands the family home, Eaton Hall.
   ``It's not something I wake up every morning with and say, `How
wonderful to have all this money,''' the duke said. ``I am not
sitting there on hard cash and it's not going into cars and boats
as I see fit.''
   Does he ever feel guilty about being born so rich?
   ``No, never have done and never will do,'' he said.
   ``I am a curator of what my family does now and of what my
family have done in the past and I am a planner of what my family
will do in the future.
   ``I use my wealth in order to create. My wealth is a business
and it is a very substantial employer of people.''
   A major drawback, he said, is having ``too little time to see
one's family. I clearly resent that.'' But he added, ``It comes
with the territory.''
   Born in 1951, he was the second of three children. The other two
were girls.
   He was reared in Northern Ireland, where his father was a member
of Parliament and ran a silversmith's business. He has described
his childhood as idyllic, isolated and free.
   A series of accidents of birth and death brought the title to
his father in 1967, and at 16, young Grosvenor was suddenly heir to
one of the world's biggest fortunes.
   At exclusive Harrow school he was an undistinguished student,
and instead of college he roughed it as a cowboy on a British
Columbia ranch, learned farm management in New Zealand, and worked
for a real estate agent and a nature conservancy agency in Britain.
   When he was 21, his father became ill and Grosvenor began to
learn the complexities of the family business.
   In 1978, he married 19-year-old Natalia Phillips, or ``Tally,''
whose great-grandfather was Grand Duke Michael of Russia.
Fittingly, they met at a ball.
   At 27, on his father's death, Grosvenor succeeded to the title.
He has two daughters and no son, so the heir to the estate is his
cousin, the Earl of Wilton.
   ``Clearly my regret is that my father went when I was very
young,'' he says. ``I had to cocoon myself at a very early age.''
   He had dreamed of an army career, and found it hard to adjust to
his responsibilities.
   He reached a compromise. During the week he is the businessman
commuting to London by helicopter. On weekends, he dons camouflage
and joins maneuvers as a major in Britain's territorial army, or
volunteer reserve force.
   The duke has tried to modernize, restructure and expand the
estate, which builds and manages shopping centers, industrial sites
and office buildings. It has extensive property interests in the
United States.
   ``My goodness, we weren't quite on the quill pens when I took
over but we weren't far from it,'' he said.
   The duke says he has another ambition: not to be the Grosvenor
who loses the family fortune. He says he's happy to pay income tax,
but his accountants spend a lot of time figuring out how to avoid
inheritance taxes.
   Some of his tenants complain that his rents are exorbitant, and
he has been tagged ``Lord Greedy Guts.'' He is unapologetic.
   ``I operate on the simple principle of supply and demand. I am
not running a charity ... for some of the richest people in the
world,'' he said. ``Someone can go and live somewhere else if they
want to. I have a waiting list from here to Washington.''
   The duke describes himself as a liberal Whig and his aides
advise the uninitiated to address him as ``Your Grace.''
   The first duke was Hugh Lupus, a Master of the Horse, who was
awarded the title in 1874 for philanthropic works. The first
recorded Hugh Lupus was William the Conqueror's huntsman whose
contribution at the Battle of Hastings won him Chester as a gift.
   The duke's treasure-filled family home is a 12-bedroom modern
glass and white tile structure his father built in 1973 to replace
a Victorian palace that was demolished.
   In his spare time, Grosvenor enjoys hunting deer and grouse. He
likes scuba diving, too: ``It's rather peaceful at the bottom of
the sea.''
   It's less peaceful on the Warrington site. News cameras click,
questions are asked. Then the duke shakes a few hands, hops behind
the wheel of his dark blue Jaguar, and sweeps off.
   With two honks and a wave.
