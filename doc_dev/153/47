<P>
Through the window of C. David Heymann's 14th-floor apartment on Central Park 
West, the tender green leaves of spring sag under the weight of a heavy rain. 
On the other side of the park's verdant expanse, on fashionable Fifth Avenue, 
lives a woman named Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis likes it or not, C. David Heymann is the man 
whose name is being linked these days with that of the Most Famous Woman in the 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Heymann is the author of one of the spring's hottest books, "A Woman Named 
Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, $21.95), a sizzling 631-page unauthorized biography of 
the former First Lady, who will turn 60 in July. 
</P>
<P>
Magazines, newspapers and television have been tripping over one another in a 
rush to get the book's most titillating tidbits into print. It has been a 
veritable Jackie bonanza, a tabloid-lover's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie and J.F.K. shot up with amphetamines by a "Dr. Feelgood." . . . A 
lovesick Marilyn phones Jackie at the White House. . . . Womanizing J.F.K. beds 
just about anything that moves. . . . Jackie's coldness makes Onassis want a 
divorce. . . . Jackie goes on shop-till-you-drop binges. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And true to her very private form, Jackie, through her spokeswoman Nancy 
Tuckerman, has had a discreet "no comment" on this latest tell-all tome. 
</P>
<P>
Why our endless fascination with a woman whom Heymann, after four years of 
research and interviews with 825 sources, still calls "a mystery, a 
hieroglyphic, a question mark"? 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie, probably because she's never spoken in her own behalf, has remained a 
subject of tremendous interest to Americans and to people all over the world," 
says Heymann, 44, who hit the best-seller lists a few years ago with "Poor 
Little Rich Girl," a biography of Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
If Jackie has maintained a regal silence, plenty of people -- from the late 
Christina Onassis to the public relations director of Maxim's -- talked to 
Heymann and his crew of researchers. And while Heymann refused to quote anyone 
anonymously, three of his main sources -- Christina Onassis, Peter Lawford and 
Truman Capote -- are dead. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the wonders of this century is that we have a tape recorder, and 
they're on tape," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Files Helped 
</P>
<P>
And thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, Heymann made extensive use of 
CIA, FBI, Secret Service and the White House social files. The Secret Service 
files chart President Kennedy's insatiable appetite for women, and Heymann's 
account of the White House years reads like "Fanny Hill." 
</P>
<P>
"I think John F. Kennedy, in retrospect, is a disgrace," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
If Kennedy and the image of Camelot emerge tattered and tarnished, Aristotle 
Onassis comes out smelling like a comparative rose. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he made some genuine efforts to have a fulfilling marriage. He grew 
close at least to John Jr.," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
Heymann claims to have only respect for the way Jackie Onassis has dealt with 
adversity and tragedy in her life and for her courage in returning to work late 
in life as a book editor. 
</P>
<P>
"She's regal; she's elegant as ever; she is an everlasting mystery," he says. 
"I think she's elevated the human spirit in this country. If there were more 
Jackie Kennedys around, this would be a better place in which to live. I find 
her to be a very noble person." 
</P>
<P>
Readers are likely to come away from "A Woman Named Jackie" with mixed emotions 
-- moved by her devastation at the loss of John F. Kennedy, put off by her 
apparent coldness and determination to live in the lap of luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"She's human. She does have frailties, and money is her Achilles' heel," 
Heymann says. "But compare her to the Duchess of Windsor, for example, who put 
herself before England. The poor guy (Edward VIII) had to step off the throne. 
Here's a woman who, despite her husband's carrying on, put the country before 
herself and supported John F. Kennedy, who lent herself to making the White 
House a splendid place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woman of Many Faces 
</P>
<P>
Although Heymann insists that his portrait of Jackie is positive, his book 
unflinchingly quotes those who see her variously as avaricious, as icy, as less 
intelligent than she has been purported to be. 
</P>
<P>
Readers learn that Christina Onassis loathed the glamorous woman who married 
her wealthy father. They read that Jackie glared icily at JFK when he and Angie 
Dickinson slipped away for an apparent tryst on Inauguration Night. They are 
told that Jackie was drinking heavily when she recounted the horrors of her 
husband's assassination to author William Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
Are there limits to what the public has a right -- or even a desire -- to know? 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are interested in people," Heymann says. "We're all animals on 
this Earth. We're all at the same watering hole and we look at each other. 
That's basically what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Heymann began his writing career as a poet and literary biographer. "Ezra 
Pound" and "American Aristocracy: The Lives and Times of James Russell, Amy and 
Robert Lowell" were nominated for Pulitzer Prizes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why the Tabloid Books? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I couldn't continue to write literary biography and support a 
family. I don't mean to suggest I write just for money, but a person does have 
to make a living," Heymann says in explaining why he has moved on to books like 
"A Woman Named Jackie" and "Poor Little Rich Girl." 
</P>
<P>
The Barbara Hutton biography, originally published by Random House in 1983, was 
recalled, according to Heymann, because of an error about the date of birth of 
a Hutton physician, which left open the possibility of a lawsuit. The physician 
was charged with overmedicating the heiress. Random House would not republish 
the book; Lyle Stuart then picked up the rights, and the book went on to become 
a best seller and a TV miniseries. Heymann says that the incident does not 
impugn his integrity or credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Heymann daunted by his own admission at the end of 631 pages that the 
real Jackie remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the book is about in a sense; it's a search for the real Jackie 
Kennedy. This is a woman who is simply unknowable, who probably doesn't even 
know herself," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
But with bookstore orders upping the in-print total of "A Woman Named Jackie" 
to 450,000 copies just a week after publication, it is clear that inquiring 
minds will take what they can get.
