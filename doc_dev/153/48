  [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held at 
the Grand People's Study House in Pyongyang on June 20 to 
introduce the book "Korea I Saw Again 40 Years After" written by 
Cuban woman lawyer Candelaria Rodriguez. 
  In his speech at the meeting, Kim Chin-pom, vice-chairman of 
the Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries, 
said that Cuban woman lawyer, the author of the book "Korea I 
saw Again 40 Years After", impressively wrote what she saw, 
heard and felt during her revisit to Korea 40 years after she 
visited Korea as a member of an international fact-finding team 
during the fatherland liberation war (June 1950- July 1953) and 
exposed to the world people the bestial atrocities committed by 
the U.S. imperialist aggressors against the Korean people. 
  He expressed the hope that this book would help the 
revolutionary people of the world to have a clearer 
understanding of the validity and invincible vitality of the 
socialist cause for its rich, truthful and revolutionary 
contents and for its diversified, concise and vivid method of 
expression. 
  Candelaria Rodriguez, the author of the book, spoke next. 
  Noting why she wrote the book, she said: 
  "I have come to write this book in order to inform the world 
people, even a little, of the true looks of Korea which rose 
like a phoenix from heaps of rubbles and has completely changed 
its appearance startling the world people under the wise 
guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  In his speech, Han Pong-chan, deputy director general of the 
Foreign Press Group, noted that the book in Spanish was 
translated and published in French, Chinese, English and Russian 
and disseminated among foreigners. This book, he added, will 
greatly encourage not only the Korean people in their tireless 
efforts to defend and further glorify the Korean-style socialism 
centred on the masses but also the revolutionary people of the 
world in their righteous struggle.
