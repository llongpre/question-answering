   When Donald Trump bought the Plaza Hotel for roughly $400 million this year, the judgment of many real estate observers was that he paid too much. 

   Industry sources, however, say Mr. Trump already has received -- and rejected -- an offer for the Plaza that would have net him a 50% profit. 

   The sultan of Brunei, reputedly the world's richest person, recently offered to buy it for a little more than $500 million. 
When Mr. Trump declined, the sultan upped his bid to roughly $600 million, the sources say. 
But Mr. Trump said no deal. 

   The sultan apparently didn't get wind that the Plaza had been on the market before Mr. Trump, who bought it from the Robert M. Bass Group, had more or less locked it up. 
"It was the one hotel he wanted to own more than any in the world," a source said of the sultan. 

   Mr. Trump declined to sell because he likes owning the famed, landmark hotel and wants to make good on his vow to make it the world's best, sources say. 
Mr. Trump declined to comment. 

   The ruler of Brunei, a tiny Asian nation on the oil-rich island of Borneo, has a fortune estimated at $25 billion, and lives in a 1,788-room palace. 

   Last year, the sultan bought the Beverly Hills Hotel from oil and entertainment tycoon Marvin Davis, reportedly for more than $200 million -- just months after Mr. Davis purchased it from one-time stock speculator Ivan Boesky for roughly $135 million.
