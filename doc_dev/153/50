A young woman threw a T-shirt at Queen Elizabeth II today and radicals 
campaigning for Maori rights heckled the British monarch during anniversary 
celebrations for the founding of modern New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The queen, who was accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, appeared shaken, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a member of New Zealand's Maori minority, threw a black T-shirt 
after the queen disembarked from the royal barge that carried her to Waitangi, 
a village in the country's far north. 
</P>
<P>
Angry spectators seized the woman, aged about 17, dragged her from the crowd 
and handed her over to police. 
</P>
<P>
As the queen gave a speech marking the 150th anniversary of the Treaty of 
Waitangi, a pact between Maoris and British colonial authorities, a small group 
of radicals shouted "You already have everything! What more do you want, 
Elizabeth?" and "150 years of oppression!"
