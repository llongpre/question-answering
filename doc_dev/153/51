Little of what Peter Zokosky paints is remarkable, and yet it is all 
remarkable. Familiarity breeds no contempt in his images of cows, plants, 
humans, clouds and sea creatures but instead evokes curiosity, wonder, respect. 
It's a matter of perception, the Long Beach painter suggests, a matter of 
looking at the surface of the world and beyond, and crediting both realities as 
equally true and accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Zokosky, whose work is on view at the Felicita Foundation Gallery (247 S. 
Kalmia, Escondido), states the case fairly plainly in his painting, "Seeing 
Cows." Five of the bovine beasts, serene and self-content, stand in profile on 
a gently rolling green pasture. One of the cows is painted in a traditional, 
naturalistic style, a faithful representation of the animal's size, shape and 
surface as seen by the naked eye. Another, however, is a mere skeleton, and 
another an anatomical cross-section of muscles and bones. Another view forgoes 
the pattern of pelt to map the cow's digestive tract. The last exists only in 
outline, as a crude, bullet-shaped mass with straight-as-stick legs like those 
drawn by a child. 
</P>
<P>
However different these views, they all represent cows. Each definition is as 
valid as the next and they coexist, comfortably. This, perhaps, is the 
"Legitimate Paradox" referred to in the show's title. What we see casually, 
with unquestioning eyes, is coupled in Zokosky's paintings with visions of 
submerged realities, hidden systems and latent mysteries. The natural world 
assumes a fascinating, fluid identity when these ordinarily concealed facets 
are brought to the surface to mingle with more familiar aspects of the same 
subjects. By paying as much attention to the unseen as to the seen, Zokosky 
sharpens our awareness of the layered quality of life, the multiple readings 
possible of any subject or situation. 
</P>
<P>
In "Gardening," the artist exposes the botanical and biological processes at 
work while a couple tends to their back yard, thereby transforming the mundane 
suburban scene into a narrative rich with sexual symbolism. In the pair's 
well-kept garden, manicured shrubs stand in a neat row before a masonry brick 
wall and a sapling stands on the lawn with the help of a supporting stake. The 
woman waters the grass with a hose and the man stands across from her, pausing 
from his work with a hoe. 
</P>
<P>
The predictability of the scene dissipates in the details. Zokosky shifts the 
perspective beneath the couple's feet and renders the earth below in 
cross-section, revealing the fine, shallow roots of the grass, the deeper, more 
complex root system of the young tree, the numerous rocks embedded in the dirt 
and the worm channels winding through it. The woman's short skirt bears a 
pattern that seems abstract, but actually diagrams her reproductive system. Her 
pairing with the sinuous lines and nourishing function of the hose confirms her 
sexual role, as does her mate's prop of a straight, solid hoe. 
</P>
<P>
Zokosky turns the familiar inside out again in "Skeleton and Goat" and in the 
diptych, "Hare and Hare After." Each work shows two views of its subject, one 
an accurate rendering of the animal's texture and mass, the other of its 
skeletal or muscular system. In "One, Two, Three," Zokosky shows what the 
unaided eye can see, but cannot seize -- the individual movements that merge to 
form continuous motion. Here, a single gray dog is seen simultaneously at three 
different stages of a backward flip. Like the pioneering, stop-action 
photographs of Eadweard Muybridge, Zokosky's painting fragments a single 
action, allowing slow scrutiny of a split-second sight. 
</P>
<P>
While many of Zokosky's works give access to the visually inaccessible, others 
elevate the known to the status of the revered through an elegant painting 
style of rich color and radiant light, as in "Serpent" and "Gibbons in the 
Trees." The artist's unpopulated landscapes are far less mesmerizing. They lack 
both the punning humor and the odd, revelatory character of the animal 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"Gentleman" is, perhaps, the oddest and most disturbing of all, for it 
introduces the notion that man is not only blind to much of the natural world, 
but also manipulative, patronizing and possessive of it. 
</P>
<P>
In this painting, a young woman sits at the base of a tree, as if engaged in a 
lesson with the gorilla seated opposite her on a small folding stool. She holds 
up a panel with a picture of a man; two other panels, depicting an antelope and 
an Oreo cookie, lay beside her on the jungle floor. 
</P>
<P>
This curious scene caricatures our insistence on relating to the non-human 
world in strictly human terms. The beauty and mystery so abundant in that 
world, and so well articulated in Zokosky's paintings, would seem to cast us 
better in the role of student than teacher.

The show continues through March 3.
