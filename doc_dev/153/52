   The legion of American billionaires has
broadened to include 51 people, despite the 1987 stock market crash
that realigned the fortunes of many of the nation's wealthiest.
   Forbes magazine says its annual survey shows the net worth of
the ultra-affluent totaled $84.8 billion _ nearly $5 billion more
than the combined wealth of last year's 49 billionaires.
   The other 349 people who constitute Forbes' list of the 400
richest Americans were worth about $135.2 billion.The average
fortune is $551 million, up $1 million from last year.
   Topping the list released Monday is 70-year-old Sam Walton, who
held the No. 1 spot for the fourth straight year even though his
net worth shrank by $2 billion following the crash.
   Walton, head of the Arkansas-based Wal-Mart discount store
empire, scoffs at his $6.7 billion fortune. He calls it ``just
paper _ all I own is a pickup truck and a little Wal-Mart stock.''
   Forbes said Walton is the world's fifth-richest person after
Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, worth $18.9 billion; Taikichiro Mori,
$18 billion; and Haruhiko Yoshimoto, $7.8 billion; and Canada's
Kenneth Cole Irving, $8 billion.
   But last year's Oct. 19 financial market crash slashed fortunes
and caused 22 former members to be dropped from the list because
their fortunes slipped below Forbes' $225 million cutoff.
   The list appears in the Oct. 24 edition of Forbes and is based
on holdings as of Aug. 30.
   Runner-up to Walton on the U.S. billionaire list is John Werner
Kluge, the German-born head of Metromedia Co., with a net worth of
$3.2 billion. Kluge was followed by H. Ross Perot, founder of
Electronic Data Systems, with $3 billion; publishers Samuel I.
Newhouse Jr. and Donald Newhouse, $2.6 billion each; and Pittsburgh
industrialist Henry Lea Hillman, $2.5 billion.
   Underscoring the adage that the more you have, the more you can
lose, billionaires were among those hit hard by the crash.Among the
big losers were David Packard, founder of Hewlett-Packard, media
magnate Keith Rupert Murdoch and retailer Leslie Wexner, each of
whom lost up to 50 percent of their fortunes.
   Among those new to the billionaire club are flamboyant New York
real estate developer Donald Trump, who claims a net worth of $3.47
billion, though Forbes' estimate is in the $1 billion range.
   Joining Trump as list rookies are: Sumner Murray Redstone, who
boosted his balance sheet with the takeover of Viacom, $1.4
billion; press-shy Charles Feeney, who runs Duty-Free Shoppers at
airports, $1.3 billion; Charles Sammons, head of the privately held
Sammons Enterprises, the nation's 15th largest cable TV operator,
$1.3 billion; Charles de Ganahl Koch and David Hamilton Koch,
brothers involved in oil services, $1.1 billion each, and Ronald O.
Perelman, takeover strategist and head of Revlon, $1 billion.
   Four businessmen returned to the ranks of multimillionaire when
their fortunes sank below $1 billion: Laurence and Robert Tisch of
Loews Corp., each estimated at $850 million; Milton Petrie, the
philanthropist and head of Petrie Stores, $750 million; and
financier Carl Lindner II, $950 million.
   William Henry Gates III, who dropped out of Harvard and founded
the Microsoft software company, remained the youngest self-made
billionaire at age 32. His net worth is estimated at $1.1 billion.
   The oldest person new to the list is Mansfield Freeman, who
holds a stake in American International Group. With a fortune of
$240 million, he made the list for the first time at age 93.
   Among the 52 who disappeared from the list, 22 vanished because
of Black Monday-associated losses, 26 were surpassed by greater
fortunes and four died. Other Forbes standbys include: real estate
tycoon Harry Helmsley, $1.7 billion; takeover strategist Carl
Icahn, $940 million; brewer August Busch Jr., $1.1 billion;
designer Ralph Lauren, $450 million; cosmetics queen Estee Lauder,
$450 million; and vintners Ernest and Julio Gallo, $350 million
each.
