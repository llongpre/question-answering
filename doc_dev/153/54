<P>
When she was a child, she liked to turn cartwheels and be called Sandra. Her 
ambition was to be a circus bareback rider. 
</P>
<P>
She did become an accomplished horsewoman, but these days, don't call her 
anything but "your royal highness." Because Alexandra Helen Olga Christabel, 
Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, Hon. Lady Ogilvy, GCVO, has a richer 
royal pedigree than the Queen of England. 
</P>
<P>
When Princess Alexandra arrives in Southern California this week to lend the 
British Royal Family's presence to the Festival of Britain in Orange County, 
residents will get a look at not only the queen's first -- and favorite -- 
first cousin, but a descendant of King George V, King Edward VII, Queen 
Victoria, King George I of Greece, King Christian IX of Denmark and the 
ill-fated Czar Alexander II of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is unknown to most Americans, in Britain, Alexandra is the most 
popular and accessible of the royals. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout her adult life she has taken on the role of what has come to be 
known as the "professional princess," representing Britain and the Royal Family 
at official engagements at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
She wears the royal mantle lightly, however. 
</P>
<P>
She is " . . . a woman of unstuffy charm and classic beauty, regal in presence 
but highly accessible," author Ralph G. Martin wrote in his book, "Charles and 
Diana." "When she was Diana's age, she was also known as a marvelous dancer, a 
gay conversationalist who loved to laugh, adored children, had a craving for 
sweets and was a ballet addict. Her favorite jazz piece was 'Ain't Misbehavin.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
But in her professional role, "she's got an enormous interest in whatever she's 
doing. That's the main thing that comes across," said Sir Eldon Griffiths, a 
member of Parliament who lives part time in Orange County, lectures at UCI and 
is the president of the county office of the World Affairs Council. "She does 
her homework and she's very well briefed. She, in fact, goes at it very hard." 
</P>
<P>
The princess visited Los Angeles in 1971, in connection with a promotion of 
British menswear. She will return briefly after her Orange County visit -- next 
Monday and Tuesday -- to, among other things, meet with Mayor Tom Bradley, 
visit Union Avenue Elementary School and observe a program for mothers of 
children born with a crack addiction at County Harbor/UCLA Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Mitchell, the princess' private secretary, said in a telephone interview 
from London that Alexandra was delighted by her last visit to Southern 
California and "thoroughly enjoys travel." 
</P>
<P>
That sort of schedule has become meat and potatoes for most members of the 
Royal Family, said John Houlton, a British vice consul based in Los Angeles. 
"They take their profession quite seriously," he said. "We think the princess 
in a sense serves in an ambassadorial role. She's a figurehead that people are 
interested in meeting." 
</P>
<P>
In a country of people whose ancestors absolutely hated King George III, modern 
British royals often are received with the sort of adulation usually reserved 
for rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
"In California," said Griffiths, "royalty is a rarity and its scarcity value 
gives it a much higher profile. There's a curiosity that is much more acute 
here than in Britain." 
</P>
<P>
Mere curiosity, however, does not fully explain the fawning looks that members 
of the British Royal Family see turned on them when they come here. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it intriguing, too. I have to say, that people in the U.S. -- and in 
France, too, which is also a republic -- are so intrigued," said Houlton. "I 
think that part of it is that the Royal Family are very much a national symbol 
of something that has endured for centuries. It has an air of majesty and 
romance to it. They're a symbol of permanence in a rather impermanent world 
these days." 
</P>
<P>
Princess Alexandra has felt the glare of celebrity almost all her life. 
</P>
<P>
Born on Christmas Day, 1936, (her fourth name commemorates her birthday), 
Alexandra is one of three children, and the only daughter, of Prince George and 
Princess Marina, Duke and Duchess of Kent. Her birth, said her grandmother, 
Queen Mary, was "the only nice thing to have happened this year" -- the year of 
the abdication of Edward VIII. 
</P>
<P>
She can trace her paternal lineage to Queen Victoria and, on her mother's side, 
to Czar Alexander II of Russia. (Queen Elizabeth is descended from royalty only 
on her father's side.) 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's father, the son of King George V and Queen Mary, died in 1942 in a 
plane crash on his way to tour RAF bases in Iceland. The princess was raised at 
Coppins, her family's country home in the Buckinghamshire village of Iver, by 
her mother, who was a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and his wife, the 
former Grand Duchess Helen of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Though Alexandra's mother was known as one of the most stylish and glamorous 
royals of her day, she enrolled her daughter as a student at Heathfield, an 
exclusive English girls' boarding school, making Alexandra the first British 
princess to attend a regular school. 
</P>
<P>
She continued her formal education in 1953-54 at a finishing school in Paris, 
staying with the family of the Count of Paris and studying French and music. 
When she returned to England, she took a nursing course at the Great Ormond 
Street Hospital for Sick Children in London, where she was known simply as 
Nurse Kent. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1950s, Alexandra had begun to take on more official royal duties, 
but she had also come to be known as the eligible young princess and began to 
be seen more in London social circles. 
</P>
<P>
Confrey Phillips, a English-born pianist who performs regularly at the Westin 
South Coast Plaza Hotel in Costa Mesa and once played in London hotels and 
nightclubs, remembered that during that time Alexandra was "a very likable 
lady. At that time she was first sort of stepping out. She liked to be with 
friends and have a nice social evening somewhere privately. When I had my 
nightclub in Mayfair (The Colony on Berkeley Square) she'd come along with her 
friends and a couple of times with her husband-to-be, although that hadn't been 
announced at the time. She liked dancing and loved music." 
</P>
<P>
She apparently loved Phillips' music, because Phillips said he and his trio 
were hired to play at Buckingham Palace for the princess' 21st birthday 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"There were about 200 people there," said Phillips, "and it was a great 
success, a great party. There was continuous dancing." 
</P>
<P>
The dancing kept up, said Phillips, even when his band took a break. A group of 
Princess Alexandra's friends who were amateur musicians acted as a relief band. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not at all aloof," said Phillips. "She's very relaxed and always has a 
lovely smile and a wonderful soft disposition about her. She's not wet and 
frumpish like some of these aristocrats can be. She's the least forbidding 
person you could meet." 
</P>
<P>
During the time she knew Phillips, Alexandra also became acquainted with a 
young commoner named Angus Ogilvy. Born in 1928, Ogilvy was the younger son of 
the Earl of Airlie and grandson of Mabell, Countess of Airlie, who was a close 
friend and lady-in-waiting to Alexandra's grandmother Queen Mary. After an 
eight-year friendship, the princess and Ogilvy were married in Westminster 
Abbey on April 24, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy, by his own choice, was not catapulted into the aristocratic 
stratosphere by his marriage to Alexandra. When the queen offered him an 
earldom (a common practice when a princess marries someone of lesser rank), 
Ogilvy refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why I should get a peerage just because I married a princess," he 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But the queen did confer a knighthood on Ogilvy in 1989, making him a Knight 
Commander in the Royal Victorian Order. A businessman who is on the boards of 
directors of several British companies, Ogilvy accompanies the princess on many 
of her trips abroad (he will come with her to Southern California) and is 
properly addressed as Sir Angus. 
</P>
<P>
The Ogilvys have two children, James Robert Bruce, born in 1964 and now married 
to Julia Rawlinson, and Marina Victoria Alexandra, born in 1966 and now married 
to Paul Mowatt. Neither are titled and are not considered to be royal. Ogilvy 
once underscored the somewhat hybrid nature of his immediate family by 
referring to its members as "mini-royals" -- on the fringe of the queen's 
immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's many tours, duties and appearances -- Houlton estimated that she 
has made 90 official foreign tours -- entitle her to receive money from the 
Civil List, which is an allowance given to members of the Royal Family by 
Parliament to help pay for staff and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the public wrongly assumes that all royals are rich," wrote Ralph 
Martin. "Princess Alexandra . . . had no money of her own. Neither did Angus 
Ogilvy, since his older brother inherited both the family title and the family 
fortune." 
</P>
<P>
Griffiths said he believes the princess was the first member of the Royal 
Family to routinely drive herself from place to place and ride on the London 
Underground, rather than be chauffeured. (In fact, in 1962, she crashed her 
Austin Mini into a truck on London's Kensington High Street. She later admitted 
she had been driving a bit too fast.) 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra does, however, have an extensive collection of jewels that have come 
to her through her royal relatives. 
</P>
<P>
But the woman wearing the gems, so firmly rooted in royal tradition, apparently 
has little use for any pretense that might be attached to them. In the midst of 
the sometimes stifling pomp associated with royal appearances, she has shown a 
sense of good-humored proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget," she said of the Royal Family in the 1960s, "that nowadays we 
have to compete with Elizabeth Taylor and the Beatles."
