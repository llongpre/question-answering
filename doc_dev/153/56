   Entertainer Ben Vereen was ordered Wednesday
to pay $7,500 to an aquaintance who claimed he broke into her home
and assaulted her. In exchange for the money, the woman agreed to
return Vereen's Les Brown recordings.
   Superior Court Judge Pro Tem Robert Zakon signed a three-page
handwritten agreement worked out by attorneys that also stipulates
Vereen and Christine Rich must stay at least 100 yards apart.
   In a complaint filed the day after the alleged March 1 attack,
Ms. Rich claimed Vereen kicked in her apartment door and assaulted
her. The actor ``grabbed my arm causing injuries, grabbed my neck,
clothing and threw me to the ground,'' she said.
   ``I was able to dial 911 and the police arrived and placed
defendant under arrest,'' she continued. ``I was placed in fear for
my life and suffered great emotional distress requiring immediate
therapy treatment.''
   Under terms of the agreement, Vereen will pay Ms. Rich $7,500
and she will return ``two Les Brown tapes, any and all answering
machine tapes and photographs of (Vereen) and letters from (Vereen)
in her possession at any time.''
   The agreement also prohibits Vereen and Ms. Rich from discussing
the case. The exact relationship between Vereen and Ms. Rich was
not known.
   Vereen, who appeared in the movie ``All That Jazz'' and such
television miniseries as ``Roots,'' and ``Ellis Island,'' didn't
attend the court proceeding.
