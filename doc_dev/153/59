<LEADPARA>  ALBERT Finney has snared the male lead in the Zanuck Company's "Rich in Love,"
which goes before the cameras in September in South Carolina.;    The British
actor will play an American Southerner going through a sudden divorce in the
feature based on the Josephine Humphreys novel. Yet to be cast are the wife,
the daughter -- through whose eyes the action is seen -- and the two young men
in the daughter's life.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Rich in Love," which reunites producers Dick and Lili Zanuck with their
"Driving Miss Daisy" director and screenwriter, Bruce Beresford and Alfred
Uhry, will be the Zanucks' second feature for MGM/Pathe. Lili completed
directorial stints on "Rush" in Houston in May and expects MGM/Pathe to unfurl
it in the fall.;    INDUSTRY EYE: Jeff Bridges heads to Seattle in August to
film "American Heart." He'll play an ex-convict who shares his apartment and
life with his troubled 14-year-old son in the film he'll co-produce.;    Teri
Garr will lead a contingent of comedians -- Madeline Kahn, Judy Tenuta, Carol
Leifer, Karen Haber and Rhonda Hansome -- in dissecting the battle of the
sexes for a Lifetime cable special titled "Lovelaughs." The soon-to-tape show
is slated to premiere Aug. 21.;    Daytime TV queen Susan Lucci takes another
turn at prime time with the shooting of ABC's "The Woman Who Sinned" TV movie
next month. Sounds like there'll be plenty of suds in the drama -- in which
the "All My Children" actress (who did a "Dallas" turn last year) plays a
woman forced to acknowledge her adultery to defend herself from a murder
charge.; From Liz Smith in New York;    RUMORS: We love 'em: The hot one
floating around the TV world all week is that in September 1992, months after
Johnny Carson has left the "Tonight" show, he might do a comedy special based
on his old "Who Do You Trust?" show. The contestants will be big, big name
stars. And who will be Carson's sidekick? Why, Ed McMahon, of course!;   
RUMORS II: That the ever-ratings-conscious TBS and CNN execs wanted to
televise the coming (or are they?) nuptials of big boss Ted Turner and his
love, the exercise queen and actress, Jane Fonda. Fonda reportedly looked
askance at such a suggestion, and Turner wasn't enthusiastic either.;     FILM
MAKER Amin Chaudri has finally closed the deal to make a major movie of
Rudyard Kipling's "Gunga Din." This will be a multimillion-dollar production
in collaboration with Russia's Leningrad Film Studios.;    Chaudri revealed,
at a celebratory gathering at New York City's River Cafe, that the movie was
supposed to have been filmed in the Kashmir region -- but now, because of all
the recent unrest, this "Gunga" will be shot in Central Asia's Kazakhstan
area. Chaudri is negotiating with Ben Kingsley to play the title role, and
he'd also like Charles Dance and Edward Fox to enact British officers. And if
Amin has his wish, Maurice Jarre will compose the score.;    The original, of
course, starred Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Victor McLaglen and, in the
title role, Sam Jaffe.  </TEXT>
