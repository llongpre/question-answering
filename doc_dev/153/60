<LEADPARA>  WANTED: Exceedingly wealthy spouse interested in matrimony, joint bank
accounts and spending large sums of money on a poor but loving mate.;    If
finding a husband or wife to fit this description is your ambition, a few tips
from Ginie Polo Sayles' "How to Marry the Rich" class could put you on the
road to a happy marriage -- happy financially, that is.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Fitting in with the rich;  Sayles, an author and lecturer, travels across
the country to share her views on how to find, fascinate and fit in with the
rich.;    "Sex, love and money are the dynamics of any relationship regardless
of income," Sayles says during a recent class in Chicago. "But with marriage
to the rich, you have a little more money to fight over.";    Sayles lectures
at self-improvement and adult education centers across the country. For an
average of $25, students get hints on dressing, table etiquette, conversation
and even sexual practices to impress the rich. Sayles also gives private
consultations to rich-mate hunters for $125.;    "This is real education for
what you want to know," Sayles says. "But you must remember that the value of
a human being, the worth of a human soul cannot be measured by money.";    The
right hangouts;  Sayles followed her own advice to attract her current
husband, a wealthy Texas businessman.;    The lecturer says about 30 percent
of her students are men.;    "What a wealthy woman really wants is someone to
spend time with her pursuing her interests," Sayles says.;    She recommends
visiting museums, antique stores and quality restaurants where the rich hang
out and poor marriage-seekers can go without spending a much money.;    Some
students already have a particular target in mind when they venture into the
class.;    "I hope to learn a few pointers on how to carry myself, how not to
feel inadequate and how to not look like I don't belong," says Beverly Davis,
who attended the Chicago class hoping to attract a wealthy man she already
knows.;    Other class members didn't take it so seriously.;    "I'm only here
because my friend bought us gift certificates for this class," says Yvonne, a
Chicagoan who declined to give her last name. "But I think you should be
honest about what you want. It's OK if the guy is rich and also has good
qualities.";    "I think this kind of thing is rather distasteful," says the
second gift-certificate recipient, Diane, who also wouldn't give her last
name.;    Sayles said she's not upset by dissenters who characterize such
spouse-hunting as mercenary.;    "You must remember that the rich themselves
are very mercenary," she says. "During my classes, one person may stand up and
be vehemently opposed to it. But I'll usually get letters later from people
who agree with me, but didn't dare speak up."  </TEXT>
