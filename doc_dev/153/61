   Oil man Marvin Davis said he sold the Beverly Hills Hotel to Sajahtera Inc. 
The price wasn't disclosed. 

   Spokesmen for Mr. Davis declined to provide any details about Sajahtera or to elaborate on a short press release. 
However, as previously reported, hotel sources have indicated the hotel was sold to the Sultan of Brunei for more than $200 million. 

   Mr. Davis purchased the hotel from the family of Ivan F. Boesky and others for about $135 million in December. 
The sale followed Mr. Boesky's $100 million settlement of insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

   In its current issue, Fortune magazine pronounced the sultan the world's richest man, estimating his net worth at $25 billion. 
The sultan, who rules Brunei, a tiny country on the oil-rich island of Borneo, lives in a 1,788-room palace and owns more than 200 polo ponies, according to the story. 

   The release said the new owners intend to pursue existing plans for "major improvements" to the posh pink hotel, which has 260 rooms and cottages.
