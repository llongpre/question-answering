THE WEALTHY believe themselves to be middle class and to be excluded from a
London or university-based upper-class establishment.
The results of a survey of 70 of Britain's richest families show that many
rich people perceive themselves to be just like everybody else.
Leicester University interviewed Midlands families deriving fortunes from
new and old money. The families, from landed gentry to captains of industry
and commerce, each had at least Pounds 250,000 in liquid assets.
Professor John Scott said many interviewees claimed their biggest
extravagance was their weekly Sainsbury's shopping bill or going out for a
meal - in spite owning a yacht, jet aircraft or private stables.
Women were less content than men. Only five of the 70 families had women
heading their business activities. In the others almost all key decisions
were taken by men.
Yet many women had played an important role in founding family fortunes
either through their work or by providing the initial capital. One woman
said: 'It was his dream, my money.'
In a surprising result business people displayed a lack of concern about
passing on their companies to their children.
