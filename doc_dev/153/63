   Being a woman has not made it difficult to govern
Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto says, but it may have caused
some difficulties for her political opponents and Moslem
fundamentalists.
   ``I don't often think of myself as a woman prime minister,'' Ms.
Bhutto said in a televised interview Sunday with David Frost.
   ``I just think of myself as someone who's leading the government,
who's got a job to do, not an easy one, and who would like to have
the prayers of well-wishers everywhere in completing the task in
strengthening the rule of law and improving the quality of life for
the people of Pakistan.''
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, is the first woman in modern times to lead a
Moslem country and is the world's youngest prime minister.
   ``I think it may be a little difficult for my opponents or the
fundamentalists to have a woman prime minister,'' she said.
   ``Of course, it's different being a woman. There's a greater
formality or distance which must be followed so I try to make the
best of it.''
   Ms. Bhutto won power in November in Pakistan's first free
elections in more than a decade. She arrived in Britain on Wednesday
for a week's visit.

   A car dealer plunked down $25,000
for rock star Tina Turner's Mercedes-Benz, but a 1957 Porsche owned
by the late Roy Orbison failed to find a buyer.
   Bidders at Sunday's 13th Annual Newport Beach Collector Car
Auction, one of the nation's largest car auctions, spent $4 million
on 400 cars, the most expensive being a 1965 Ford Shelby 350
prototype that sold for $100,000.
   Miss Turner's 1984 Mercedes-Benz 280 GE wagon, which resembles a
Jeep, was purchased by an import car dealer in Springfield, Ill.,
said auction spokeswoman Christine Main.
   Among the celebrity cars that didn't sell were rock 'n' roll
singer Orbison's Porsche and a vintage Corvette belonging to
``Dynasty'' television star John James.

   Household hints columnist Heloise keeps
her larder stocked and has a maid to help clean up, but she doesn't
recommend that guests try to eat off the kitchen floor.
   The 38-year-old Heloise, whose real name is Ponce Kiah Marchelle
Heloise Cruse Evans, said she considers herself a good housekeeper,
but not a great one.
   The Dallas Morning News interviewed Heloise for its Sunday
editions to see if she follows her own ``helpful hints'' to good
housekeeping.
   ``If by your definition of good housekeeper _ can you eat off the
kitchen floor and are the baseboards clean and are the windows
shiny? _ then I'm probably not,'' she said.
   But, she added, ``we never run out of toilet paper and paper
towels in this house. There's always enough canned goods in there,
and bread and milk and butter and some fruit, so that no one's going
to starve.''
   Heloise lives with her husband and 14-year-old stepson.
   The columnist works out of her San Antonio home, but travels so
much that she needs a maid twice weekly to help with chores.

   Six of the world's 10 richest people are
Japanese, but the United States still leads in the number of
billionaires, according to Forbes magazine.
   For the third straight year, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list
of private billionaires, although his wealth shrank during the last
year.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, had a personal net
worth of at least $15 billion, down from $18.9 billion last summer.
The fall was attributed mainly to the rise in the value of the
dollar against other major currencies.
   In its July 24 issue, Forbes said second-ranked Taikichiro Mori,
a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings in Tokyo,
had an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion.
   Next was Sam Moore Walton, founder of the third-largest retailer
in the United States, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Walton and his family are
worth an estimated $8.7 billion.
   Others in the top 10 were: the Reichmann brothers, Canada, real
estate, more than $8 billion; Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea, candy, real
estate, $8 billion; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan, publishing,
real estate, $7.8 billion; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real estate,
hotels, $7 billion-plus; Haruhiko Yoshimoto and family, Japan, real
estate, $7 billion; Hans and Gad Rausing, Sweden, liquids packaging,
$7 billion; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, land, $6.6 billion.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth more than $1 billion. They included
55 Americans, 41 Japanese and 20 from West Germany.

   Martina Navratilova lost and laughed.
Steffi Graf won and cried. And about the only thing Boris Becker
fumbled at Wimbledon was the winner's trophy.
   ``I wanted it so badly that I put a little more pressure on
myself than usual,'' the 20-year-old Graf of West Germany said after
overpowering Navratilova in the final set to win her second straight
women's championship 6-2, 6-7, 6-1. ``It's an overwhelming feeling.''
   Also Sunday, Becker blasted passing shots down both lines to
defeat defending champion Stefan Edberg in straight sets in a
rematch of the 1988 final, claiming his third Wimbledon title in
five years.
   The 21-year-old West German, who regained the title he won in
1985 and 1986, defeated Edberg 6-0, 7-6, 6-4 in the most one-sided
final since John McEnroe allowed Jimmy Connors only four games in
1984.
   The championship trophy was the about only thing he couldn't
handle. As he strolled around Centre Court showing off the cup, he
light-heartedly juggled the trophy and fumbled it _ allowing the top
to pop off and onto the grass court.
