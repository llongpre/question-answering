the list for four years.;    Sam Moore Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart Stores
discount chain, would be the world's richest individual, but he has split his
money among five family members. The Waltons' $18.5 billion is nearly $9
billion more than the next family fortune, the du Ponts', Forbes said.;   
John Werner Kluge, founder of Metromedia, an entertainment and communications
conglomerate, remained the richest American, the magazine said. He was
estimated to have a net worth of $5.6 billion.;    Despite Mori, the United
States led the list of billionaires, with 64 individuals and 32 families
estimated to have a net worth of more than $1 billion. Japan was second, with
41 billionaires; Germany was third with 40.;    The American billionaires are
worth a total of $207 billion, Forbes said, and the Japanese are worth more
than $126 billion.;    Two of the billionaire fortunes identified belong to
Colombian cocaine smugglers. Pablo Escobar Gaviria recently turned himself in
and the Ochoa brothers are already in prison. Both of their fortunes are
estimated to exceed $2.5 billion.;    The list appears in the magazine's July
22 issue.  </TEXT>
