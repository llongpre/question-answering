   Friday's mild updraft in the markets was little
relief to those nursing the wounds inflicted so far by the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2:
   _ Nearly half a trillion dollars has been stripped from the
value of U.S. stocks, roughly equaling the damage done on Black
Monday in 1987.
   _ Oil prices have leaped above $30 per barrel, pushing unleaded
gasoline prices up more than 15 cents per gallon at the pumps.
   _ Mortgage rates have moved back over 10 percent as yields on
Treasury securities have risen in the bond market.
   _ Gold has soared well above $400 per ounce.
   _ The dollar has tumbled against other major currencies in
foreign exchange, tarnishing its image as a safe haven in times of
world turmoil.
   The crisis has proved an unusually heavy burden for the markets
by striking at a time when recession worries already were eroding
confidence. The situation also recalled unhappy memories of the
sour investment climate that accompanied Mideast troubles in the
1970s.
   There was some good financial news on the military front,
however. A World War II-era statute makes reservists summoned to
active duty eligible for an interest-rate cut to 6 percent for a
wide range of debts incurred before being called up.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: The Bad News Keeps Coming</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The economic news from Washington continued to paint a bleak
picture. A report on the second-quarter gross national product
pegged growth at a paltry 1.2 percent. The report showed the
economy was weakening well before the Mideast crisis.
   The wealthiest fraction of America is still doing splendidly
well by the latest government measure. The Internal Revenue Service
said the richest 3.3 million people in the country held $4.3
trillion in 1986, exceeding the value of the GNP that year.
   An auto sales report from Detroit showed mid-August sales fell
4.7 percent. It was the first report since the Gulf erupted, but it
showed no rush yet to fuel-efficient cars.

<HEAD>COMPANIES: Lincoln, Layoffs, A New Turner Venture</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge upheld the government takeover of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association, saying the operation of the notorious
thrift by Charles H. Keating Jr. and his associates ``amounted to
looting.''
   National Semiconductor and Data General Corp. both announced big
layoffs, amounting to about 2,000 workers each, deepening cost cuts
in the technology sector.
   Elsewhere, USAir said it was issuing pink slips to 1,500
probationary employees and canceling a planned expansion. The move
was blamed on the sobering outlook for the economy.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it would drop a plan to market the popular
Maalox antacid and other Rhone-Poulenc Rorer products rather than
fight a federal antitrust suit.
   CBS turned over the presidency of its troubled news division
again, moving Eric Ober in and David Burke out.
   MCI Communications said it would take a writedown of at least
$500 million to cover the costs of speeding up its conversion from
analog to digital technology.
   Ted Turner, meanwhile, started a modest _ by his standards _ new
venture in book publishing tied to television programming. Set for
release on Valentine's Day is ``Kisses,'' a photo collection
including the steamy embrace of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in
``Gone With the Wind.''

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Trump Gets A Second Roll</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For Donald Trump, it was another humbling week. He found the
fate of his complex debt restructuring being decided by casino
regulators for the state of New Jersey, who put their stamp of
approval on a new loan from his banks.
   Trump himself was relegated to spectator status at several days'
worth of state hearings, where he was reduced to conducting
business by pay telephone during breaks in the proceedings.
   Adding insult to injury, Fortune magazine on Tuesday dumped the
ex-billionaire from its annual list of the world's richest people.
Trump, worth $1.7 billion by Fortune's estimates last year, now
could have a negative net worth according to the documents released
by New Jersey gambling regulators.
   Although mildly humiliating, the agreement reached with the
Casino Control Commission at least helped Trump avert disaster. The
bank deal gave him $65 million in new credit and put a moratorium
on some other pressing loan payments. Trump, in turn, promised to
make payments on bonds financing his casinos and live within a
strict budget. With fresh capital in hand, he took the Trump
Shuttle off the market for the time being.
   Also during the week, he peddled a new book, titled ``Surviving
at the Top.''

<HEAD>NEW PRODUCT OF THE WEEK: Roach Repellent</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``There's no silver bullet,'' lamented Richard Brenner, who has
spent the past six years trying to invent a more potent cockroach
repellent.
   But Brenner and Air Vent Inc. of Peoria Heights, Ill., may have
developed the next best thing.
   Air Vent said it envisions bringing a new repellent to market in
insulation and other construction materials within a year _ raising
hopes for enlarging the $1.5 billion business of controlling
roaches.

<HEAD>BIZSPEAK: Some New Cliches for Cocktails</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Lest you be caught cliche-less at the next board meeting or
cocktail hour, Working Woman magazine issued a dispatch on what's
new in the lingo of movers and shakers.
   Among the words and phrases being culled from cool-speak are
``fast-trackers,'' ``I hear you,'' and thankfully,
``user-friendly.''
   Additions for the '90s include ``lean and mean,''
``cross-training,'' ``right-sizing,'' and ``comfort level.''
