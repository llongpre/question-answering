   To review or not to review.
   The dilemma has spun a web of controversy and conflict around
``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' the first offering of an ambitious,
for-profit laboratory for new American musicals.
   A musical version of the film that won William Hurt an Oscar was
reviewed Friday in The New York Times by its chief theater critic,
Frank Rich, despite pleas by the organization presenting what it
calls a workshop production.
   The organization, New Musicals, says it had sought a no-review
policy from the media for its season of shows that began May 1 with
``Spider Woman.'' The musical is being performed through June 24 at
the State University of New York at Purchase, 25 miles north of New
York City.
   ``We tried to create an alternative method of development to
Broadway,'' Martin J. Bell, producing director of New Musicals, said
Thursday. ``If the Times policy stands, I would recommend to a
writer or a director that they do a show right on Broadway instead
of coming here. What they did was invade the work process here.''
   A review by Rich usually can make or break a show on Broadway.
New Musicals had hoped to keep The New York Times from reviewing the
show, which is undergoing changes and rewrites during its two-month
run in Purchase.
   A contingent from New Musicals, including Bell, met earlier in
May with Warren Hoge, assistant managing editor of the Times, and
with Marvin Siegel, its cultural editor, in an effort to persuade
the paper not to review ``Spider Woman.'' But they were not
successful.
   ``Reviewing the arts is one of the reader services provided by
The New York Times,'' said Hoge. ``This is a show involving some
very prominent and interesting people in the American musical
theater. It is presented to the public as a commercial enterprise,
charging a competitive price and it's playing in our town.
   ``We have covered the project (New Musicals) a number of times,
and we are covering the show. Any news organization is wary of
deliberately not covering something,'' Hoge added.
   Rich's review, largely negative, finds irony in what he describes
as the overly elaborate, Broadway-style staging.
   ``If anything, the tragedy of `Spider Woman' is that New
Musicals, which describes itself as a `new Broadway,' in its
promitional lterature, has not allowed the work to develop slowly in
a laboratory staging, as nonprofit, off-Broadway companies have
helped develop adventurous musicals like `A Chorus Line,' or `Sunday
in the Park With George,''' Rich wrote. ``Instead, `Spider Woman'
arrives already burdened with the full, and in this case crushing,
weight of Broadway extravagance.''
   Other New York critics were informed of the Times' decision to
review the show, and several decided to review the show before
Rich's notice came out.
   Clive Barnes, theater critic of the New York Post, said the
Times' review policy made it impossible for him to ignore the
musical. He panned the show in Thursday's newspaper, but was even
more scathing about the Times' policy for the show.
   ``A local occurrence has been transformed into a national
event,'' wrote Barnes, who used to be theater critic for the Times.
He said the Times' decision was ``inimical to the health of the
Broadway theater.''
   A Daily News critic will review the show Friday and other
critics, including those of Variety and The Associated Press, will
review it in the near future.
   Interest in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' has been high since the
project was announced in January. The musical involves some of
Broadway's biggest talents.
   The show is directed by Harold Prince, director of ``The Phantom
of the Opera,'' and has a book by playwright Terrence McNally. The
score was written by John Kander and Fred Ebb, the team behind
``Cabaret'' and ``Zorba.''
   Bell vowed that New Musicals, which has a first-year budget of
about $10 million, would continue its season of four shows. ``Spider
Woman''' will be followed by ``The Secret Garden,'' based on the
classic children's novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It runs Oct. 23
through Dec. 23.
   ``If I can't change the (Times) policy in the future, I have to
rethink the whole operation,'' Bell added. ``It makes us a very
different kind of place. I'm worried it will scare some important
artists away.''
