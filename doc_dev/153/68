   Daphne du Maurier, author of ``Rebecca,'' died
Wednesday at her home in Cornwall, the wildly beautiful English
province in which she set many of her celebrated novels of romance
and the supernatural. She was 81.
   Her novels like ``Rebecca,'' ``Frenchman's Creek,'' ``My Cousin
Rachel,'' and ``Jamaica Inn'' were household names in popular
fiction and became hit movies.
   The du Maurier style, vivid and gothic, made for spine-chilling
films like Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Birds,'' from her short story,
and Nicolas Roeg's ``Don't Look Now,'' from her novella.
   Dame Daphne, as she was known after being honored by Queen
Elizabeth II, died in her sleep, said her friend and legal
executor, Monty Baker-Munton.
   Until about two weeks ago, she had been fit enough for daily
walks with her dog around Par, the Cornish village where she had
lived in widowed seclusion for 20 years.
   Daphne du Maurier was born in London on May 13, 1907, one of
three daughters of the renowned actor Sir Gerald du Maurier.
   Educated by private tutors in Paris, she was 21 when she
published her first articles and short stories. Her first novel,
``The Loving Spirit,'' appeared in 1931.
   The novel captivated a young British army major and led to a
storybook courtship.
   The officer, Frederick A. M. ``Boy'' Browning, resolved to meet
the young woman and journeyed to Par to find her. They met in 1932
and married a few months later.
   ``It was rather woman's magazine-y,'' she remarked afterward.
   In the same year she published her second novel, ``I'll Never be
Young Again.'' ``Jamaica Inn,'' a big seller, followed in 1936, and
then came ``Rebecca.''
   ``Rebecca,'' about a young bride whose probing into the death of
her husband's previous wife leads her into a frightening
psychological labyrinth, was published in 1938 and sold 1 million
copies in hard cover alone. It was reprinted 39 times, launched
Laurence Olivier's movie career opposite Joan Fontaine, and was
translated worldwide.
   She became Lady Browning with the ennoblement of her husband,
who had been commander of British Airborne Forces in World War II
and then treasurer to Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II.
   In 1943, they rented Menabilly, the rambling, often fog-shrouded
Georgian manor which had inspired Manderley, the fire-doomed
mansion in ``Rebecca.''
   Oliver Cromwell's troops gutted the house during the English
Civil War, and legend had it that a cavalier was bricked up alive
in one of Menabilly's gray stone buttresses.
   The writer's hideaway was a gardener's hut, where, she said,
``I'd sit for hours on end, chain-smoking, chewing mints and
tapping away at my typewriter.''
   She would prowl the grounds of Menabilly or answer stacks of fan
mail when not at work on her writing.
   Her husband died in 1965. In 1969, Dame Daphne, as she had
become that year, moved from Menabilly to Par with her two
Yorkshire terriers and rented another mansion, Kilmarth. ``It is
rather like death to have to leave,'' she said. Despite her wealth,
she never owned a home.
   At Kilmarth she wrote ``The House on the Strand.'' Her last
novel was ``Rule Britannia,'' published in 1972. ``Growing Pains,''
a memoir of her early years, appeared in 1981, and her introduction
to a new book on Cornwall will appear in the fall.
   Although always cheerful and kind to friends, she preferred a
secluded life. ``I can't say I really like people,'' she once
remarked. ``Perhaps that's why I always preferred to create my own
instead of mixing with real ones.''
   She waited until age 64 before consenting to be interviewed on
TV.
   Baker-Munton said she would be cremated later this week at a
private ceremony with no flowers and only family friends, her son
and two daughters, in accordance with her wishes.
