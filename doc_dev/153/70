their money in the salerooms

IT IS a source of profound disappointment to antique dealers and auction
houses that the very rich rarely buy works of art. They prefer to squander
their time, and their wealth, on houses and horses, yachts and cars and
private jets rather than develop a connoisseur's eye.
Few of the British self-made millionaires of the 1980s became habitues of
Sotheby's and Christie's, or the Bond Street dealers, and if they did it was
generally to decorate their Mayfair apartments or Cotswold mansions with
comforting 18th-century furniture.
The flashiest buyers were the newly enriched foreigners who settled here.
Al-Tajir, from the Emirates, bought most of the ornate 18th- and
19th-century silver by de Lamerie and Storr to appear on the market in the
late 1980s, and in his desire to become an English gentleman Asil Nadir
spent lavishly on the contents of his London HQ. Guided by his interior
decorator he invested a reputed Pounds 7m through the leading London
furniture dealers, acquiring solid if unexciting antiques. He gave over the
odds for many items and when the liquidators cashed in the goods in 1991
they raised only Pounds 4.5m.
Most millionaires lack even Nadir's pretensions. Perhaps the saddest aspect
of the Maxwell debacle was the tasteless 'antiques' which filled his home
and office. There is talk of his children having good pictures but, judging
by the lacklustre auctions organised by his liquidators, art was not a
dealing area to catch the Big Man's interest.
Of course millionaires often employ a tame decorator to acquire the
trappings of wealth for their homes, but this is hardly collecting. Not
surprisingly, the most avid collectors among our local tycoons have been
individuals with ingrained artistic pretensions. Andrew Lloyd Webber is the
man that the dealers and auction houses are happiest to see. Buying now
through dealer David Mason, he has amassed the finest private collection of
Victorian art in the country, if not the world.
Recently his taste has broadened and in 1992 he paid the highest auction
price of the season when acquiring Canaletto's view of the Old Horse Guards
in Whitehall for Pounds 10.12m. He went on to buy the mad Richard Dadd's
great fairy picture, 'Contradiction', for Pounds 1.65m. Both are now on loan
to the Tate Gallery, which improves their public access - and their value.
Sir Andrew is obsessed with his boyhood passion for 19th-century art, in
particular the Pre-Raphaelites, and intends one day to open a private
museum.
This is the path followed already by the other great British collector of
the last two decades, advertising man Charles Saatchi. There has always been
some confusion as to how much of the vast collection of contemporary art
amassed by Saatchi was owned by him, and how much by the agency that he
built, fleetingly, into a world leader. There is certainly no doubting its
importance, and the occasional public shows in Saatchi's north London
private museum give access to a spread of contemporary art than no public
museum in the UK can emulate. If Saatchi likes an artist, he will buy up his
entire exhibition. In the main his investments have proved shrewd and his
art collection is now much more valuable than Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
In the last two years Saatchi has been off-loading some of his early loves,
works by Andre, Schnabel, Twombley and Lucian Freud, among others, to buy
the new Minimalist artists, plus the elderly RA Carel Weight and the young
aficionado of rotting whales, Damien Hurst. Saatchi has played the art
market better than any other collector. A Cy Twombley that he sold last year
for Dollars 1.65m cost him less than Dollars 100,000. He is the exception to
the rule that investing in art is a fool's paradise.
But both Saatchi and Sir Andrew had a feeling for art before they made their
money. It does seem that unless you have confidence in your own taste,
together with cultural leanings, you are left standing at the threshold.
Pop stars are rarely short of ego and like to think their music is art so
they were natural prey for the dealers. The death of Freddie Mercury was a
severe loss to the art market. He bought widely, from Japanese prints to
19th-century paintings, with a bizarre side interest in the lightly clad
females of Sir William Russell-Flint. Paul McCartney has spent millions on
art, including paintings by Magritte, de Kooning and Picasso: his special
passion is anything relating to Rupert Bear.
Also familiar faces in the auction rooms are Bob Geldoff, a knowledgeable
buyer of contemporary art, as is Peter Gabriel; Mick Jagger (whose interest
extends to the ultimate in connoisseurship, Old Master drawings); Elton John
(who sold his eclectic group of jewels, art deco, pop memorabilia, etc for
Pounds 4.8m at the peak of the art boom and subsequently invested in
contemporary Russian art); and Brian May of Queen (early photographs).
But the commitment of British show business to art is minor league stuff
compared with the collecting of the American entertainment industry. The
hills around Hollywood are the home of the new great collections. Madonna
has her personal curator who has bought the moderns - Picasso, Leger, the
Mexican Frida Kahlo and, recently, a 14th-century Old Master Madonna. Jack
Nicholson is a keen collector of modern art, including the work of Soutine;
Elizabeth Taylor buys jewels, naturally, but also Impressionists, and owns a
Van Gogh which she failed to sell at auction for Pounds 10m; and Dustin
Hoffman buys but Teddy Bears.
American millionaires are no more avid about art than their British
equivalents, but because there are so many more of them their impact is
greater. There is also much more of an art-as-investment ethos in the US.
When Alfred Taubman, the shopping mall tycoon, bought Sotheby's in 1983, he
began to drum up turnover by promoting art as a shrewd buy among his
super-rich acquaintances. With the help of loans and credit facilities the
great art boom of the late 1980s was fuelled, and prices of Impressionist
and Modern art in particular spiralled to dazzling heights.
For a time Picassos, Van Goghs and Renoirs were traded internationally like
equities. Suspect new millionaires, like Alan Bond, borrowed recklessly to
build up prestigious art collections which they hoped would add lustre to
their business empires. Bond never managed to pay back the Sotheby's loan to
acquire Van Gogh's 'Irises' for Dollars 53.9m, but fortunately the Getty
Museum stepped in and took the painting off his hands.
Sotheby's even managed to persuade the arriviste Japanese, always
susceptible to western fads, to buy up art by the plane load. This
unsustainable bubble reached its peak in May 1990 when a Japanese paper
manufacturer, Ryoei Saiti, paid Dollars 82.5m for a Van Gogh and Dollars
78.1m for a Renoir in the same week. These are the highest prices ever
achieved for works of art and it is unlikely that they will be matched for
many years.
The recession has left millionaires much poorer, and contemplating
over-priced works of art on their walls and in their bank vaults. Meanwhile,
the handful of serious billionaire connoisseur collectors sat on their hands
and waited for prices to return to rational levels. Perhaps they feel
normality has returned. One of the great collectors is Niarchos, the
shipping tycoon. He is believed to be the buyer of Cezanne's 'Still life
with apples' which sold for Dollars 28.6m in New York earlier this month,
making the auction houses smile for the first time in three years.
Other knowledgeable collectors are Baron Thyssen, who is also a director of
Sotheby's and who bought a Constable at auction there for Pounds 10m;
Barbara Johnson, the widow of the baby powder tycoon, who bought the
Badminton cabinet for Pounds 8.58m; Sol Steinberg, the publishing
billionaire and buyer of expensive Bacons; and Walter Annenberg, another
American publisher. When the price goes above Dollars 10m at a major
Impressionist sale they are likely to be among the half dozen likely bidders
 -unless Sotheby's and Christie's have managed to convert a new player to
the game.
As big collectors of British and European art, like Paul Mellon, stop adding
to their collections, or like Wendell Cherry and Malcolm Forbes, die, the
future for the collecting of traditional European artefacts dims.
Fortunately most of the great works are already in museums, and some
museums, like the Getty and the Kimbell at Fort Worth, are as well endowed
as any rich individuals, and can pick up masterpieces at auction.
The fact remains that whereas a century ago anyone who made a fortune was
likely to seek social acceptance by assembling an art collection, these days
the desire is absent. There will still be great collections assembled, but
in esoteric fields. The era of the great buyers of Old Masters,
Impressionists, furniture and silver, is past.
