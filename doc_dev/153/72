   Once she was a cigarette girl. Later, she became
a queen. Now, Leona Helmsley is a felon facing the prospect of
trading her ermine robes for prison stripes.
   Mrs. Helmsley won't immediately lose her freedom. She was
sentenced to four years in prison, but has appealed her conviction
for evading $1.2 million in taxes and remains free on bail.
   She has long since lost the royal aura projected in ads
featuring her and promoting her hotels, which described the
flagship Helmsley Palace as ``the only palace in the world where
the queen stands guard.''
   During her trial, Mrs. Helmsley was revealed as a woman who
charged underwear and other purchases to her business; who fiercely
and vituperatively berated employees, firing them on a whim; who
mocked the law.
   ``We don't pay taxes,'' a maid quoted Mrs. Helmsley as saying.
``Only the little people pay taxes.''
   The trial was open season on Leona. In opening arguments, her
own attorney labeled her ``a tough bitch.'' In closing, a
prosecutor attacked her ``selfishness, greed and sheer arrogance.''
   She was scorned almost universally. Mayor Edward I. Koch called
her ``the wicked witch.'' Donald Trump said she was ``a sick
woman.''
   Leona Mindy Rosenthal was born 69 years ago. Her father was a
Brooklyn hatmaker.
   She has had several careers; she was a showroom model and a
Chesterfield cigarette girl. Later, she became a successful real
estate broker.
   She met real estate titan Harry Helmsley in 1971. He hired her
as a $500,000-a-year senior vice president and married her a year
later, divorcing his wife of 33 years.
   Leona Helmsley had been married before, too. She divorced her
lawyer husband in 1959. She had a son by that marriage, Jay
Panzirer; she cried in court when his death in 1982 was mentioned,
though she had taken his widow to court to deny her money from her
son's estate.
   Mrs. Helmsley's devotion to her husband and his devotion to her
have never been questioned. She calls him ``gorgeous one ...
pussycat ... snooky, wooky, dooky.'' For her birthday, he lighted
the Empire State Building _ in which he holds a major stake _ red,
white and blue.
   The Helmsleys head a real estate empire valued at $5 billion,
and their personal wealth is estimated at $1 billion. They live
lavishly in Palm Beach, Fla.; at a duplex atop Manhattan's Park
Lane Hotel; and at their 28-room mansion, Dunnellen Hall, in
Greenwich, Conn.
   Dunnellen Hall was at the center of the allegations against the
Helmsleys. Helmsley, 80, originally was charged, but he was found
incompetent for trial because of diminished mental capacity.
   Mrs. Helmsley was convicted of charging to the business millions
of dollars spent to renovate the home.
   For the moment, she can still enjoy the marble dance floor on
the roof of a pool enclosure, the $130,000 indoor-outdoor sound
system, the jade art objects that cost $500,000.
   But the judge decided Tuesday that she would have to leave all
that behind. He ordered a four-year prison sentence. She would be
eligible for parole after 16 months.
