There was a time, not long ago, when it was still taboo to talk about money. 
The subject was right up there with race and class: pervasive, but unfit for 
polite dinner con versation. 
</P>
<P>
Then something happened. Things changed. And what I wanted to know was, when 
did it become OK to talk about money? Stranger still, how on earth did it come 
to seem mandatory? 
</P>
<P>
The answer turns out to have nettlesome implications. Like any right-minded 
moralist, I abhorred the Reagan-era obsession with precocious wealth and 
corporate success. BMWs give me emotional hives. Suspenders are the devil's 
plaything. All this talk of money makes me shudder. 
</P>
<P>
I still hate the acquisitive mentality. But I've come to believe that all the 
talk is something else again. I've come to believe the talk is -- dare I say 
it? -- a very good thing. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple. When nobody talked about money, there were really two 
kinds of people: those with so much dough it didn't need discussion, and those 
with so little there was nothing to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
Things are different now. An awful lot of people have a little money. Sure, the 
Reagan Administration made the rich richer at the expense of the poor and 
middle classes -- in some ways, with their complicity. But even if the 
concentration of American wealth has never stopped increasing, a huge middle 
class somehow sprang up. 
</P>
<P>
This vast bourgeoisie is a relatively modern product of everything from estate 
taxes to World War II to a nation increasingly made and descended of 
extraordinarily motivated immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the investment opportunities of this middle class have exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Through mutual funds, the smallest savers have access to investment 
opportunities previously restricted -- by tradition, fees and secrecy -- to the 
rich. An article in this newspaper recently explained how someone with $1,000 
could easily assemble a diversified portfolio reaching from Treasury bills to 
gold. Another reported that money managers catering to the very rich don't 
particularly outperform funds open to any Joe or Jane Saver right off the 
street -- good news to the 23 million households investing in mutual funds, up 
400% in just a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does this help make capital markets efficient. It also makes them more 
democratic. What we have witnessed, in fact, in accelerating fashion since the 
Depression and with steps backward only in the 1980s, is the increasing 
democratization of money in America -- something we all favor in principle but 
don't always like in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Telling people not to talk or think about money is like telling slaves to wait 
for heaven in the afterlife, or schoolteachers not to form unions. The stupid 
fact is that money is indispensable, not only to survival but for the leisure 
to create laws, art and so forth. Civilization would dry up without the stuff. 
The miracle is not that we talk about it. It is that, for so long, we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
So when did all this change? My friend Joe Nocera, who is writing a history of 
personal finance, pinpoints a single year. In 1972, he notes, the money market 
mutual fund was born, which enabled the average saver to earn an unregulated, 
market return, and what was then Time Inc. created Money magazine, which 
"brought money out of the closet." 
</P>
<P>
The forces that got us all talking about money are manifold. Joe's favorite is 
inflation during the Nixon and Carter years. With prices and interest rates 
going haywire, these became a subject of obsessive concern. John Updike's 
"Rabbit Is Rich" captures the period beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
A related factor is the enormous increase in real estate prices in the past 
couple of decades. The deregulation of bank interest rates played a role, as 
did the astonishing bull stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of personal credit was equally astonishing and important. Trusty old 
M1, the favorite money-supply measure of Econ 1A, was nearly destroyed as a 
meaningful figure by money market funds and a zillion credit cards. Remember 
the old saw about the tidal wave that might result if everyone in China jumped 
off a chair simultaneously? Well, imagine what would happen to the velocity of 
money if every middle-class American whipped out the plastic in his pocket and 
simultaneously charged it to the hilt. All of us now have the power to create 
money; we're like walking Federal Reserve Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not forget women. The democratization of money included jobs for them, 
and increasingly, equal pay for equal work. Except for the odd paradox that all 
these new workers may have contributed to a price structure that makes two 
incomes seem mandatory, more women have become masters of their own finances. 
And since money is, to an unfortunate extent, destiny, they were suddenly 
masters of a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
Good for them. Good for everyone. If we have to hear a lot of boring talk about 
money, well, personal freedom is not without its modest price. Anyone who 
thinks we overlook the Bronte sisters because we're obsessing over money is 
crazy. Being poor certainly won't help Johnny read, success in school being 
correlated to family income. More important, shutting up about money won't make 
anyone better off.
