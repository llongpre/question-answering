'ROYAL WATCHER' KEEPS TABS ON ALL THE WINDSOR RICHES

<P>
The Queen of England is worth well over 2,000 times her weight in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly. 
</P>
<P>
In mere money, the 126-pound monarch, almost certainly the world's richest 
woman at any weight, possesses somewhere between $1.72 billion and $2.04 
billion. And -- here's the good part -- it's all tax free. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a good chunk of the royal private fortune derives from gifts, some 
dating back to the days of Queen Victoria, of jewels, land and hefty sums of 
cash from maharajahs, sheiks, sultans and subjects who show no signs of turning 
off the tap to the sovereign -- or her family. 
</P>
<P>
These estimates are made by Andrew Morton, professional "royal watcher," who 
traced the British royal family's private holdings -- in precious gems, 
estates, art, investments, race horses, automobiles, even a stamp collection -- 
to come up with what he claims is the best guess yet of how rich the royal 
family really is. 
</P>
<P>
Of course estimates of the royal riches are cranked out regularly, in what 
amounts to a mini-industry. Last September, Fortune magazine put the queen's 
worth at $10.9 billion. Other estimates have varied wildly over the years from 
a few paltry millions to as much as $26 billion, all of which Morton maintains 
are skewed by questionable motive or bad information. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this huge wall of secrecy surrounding anything to do with the royal 
family," Morton said in an interview in Los Angeles. "Everybody thinks they 
know everything about the Windsors. They know nothing. The often used image is 
that the Windsors live in a goldfish bowl. If it's a goldfish bowl, it's one 
that's been blacked out." 
</P>
<P>
Morton has laid out his stalking of the royal finances in a new book published 
simultaneously here and in Great Britain, where it was excerpted in a national 
newspaper and is due to be serialized in other publications. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the British Royal Family" is studded with 
the usual royal tidbits: a Canadian air force jet being dispatched to return 
Prince Charles' "beloved" crocodile shoehorn left behind on a visit to 
Winnipeg, the queen diverting her yacht so that she could mail a letter, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
But the core of the book is a cold-eyed banker's assessment of the origins and 
disposition of the private wealth that supports the House of Windsor. One 
chapter traces the development of the family's finances from Queen Victoria to 
the present, including deductions based on the limited evidence available about 
the current queen's stock portfolio, apparently brimming with mining and 
electronic issues and estimated to be worth $595 million to $680 million by 
Morton. 
</P>
<P>
"I hired somebody for two months who was a proper stocks and shares expert to 
look into this thing because their (the royal family's) stocks and shares are 
disguised by something called the Bank of England nominee accounts, which were 
set up by the government in order specifically to shield the queen's 
investments from investigation," Morton explained. 
</P>
<P>
The book's appendix includes an inventory of "known" royal jewels, estimates of 
land values and income from estates and other holdings, including a shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The inventory of Queen Elizabeth's private jewelry -- as opposed to the crown 
jewels and other property held in public trust -- includes a tiara last seen in 
public in 1911 with an estimated value of $600,000 and a 94.4-carat diamond 
valued at $9.5 million. The assessment made for Morton puts the total value of 
the diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls and sapphires at $60.6 million to $71 
million. It is a conservative estimate and does not include the market value -- 
up to 10 times or more of assessed worth -- that would be added because of 
their royal ownership, according to Morton. 
</P>
<P>
During his investigation, Morton said he bumped into a lot of obstacles -- laws 
that shroud royal investments in secrecy, uncooperative sources close to the 
royal family and the family's own fierce protection of its privacy. For 
example, since the time of Queen Victoria, royal financial advisers have taken 
"the secrets that they have to the grave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morton is the author of seven books about the royal family, a former newspaper 
correspondent who covered the royal beat and now proprietor of Palace Press, an 
independent news agency specializing in news and features about the royal 
family. But even for him, Morton admitted, much of royal life is unknown 
territory. Not only that, but the royals are protected by a "global myth 
machine" that further obscures the difference between royal image and reality, 
Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The royal family, like the best actors, put on a very good display for the 
public but in private they are very different people," he continued. "They're 
not everything that the public thinks. For example, the royal family today 
lives very much the way Queen Victoria did. Prince Charles, this man who is 
described as 'everyman, the crusading prince,' still goes grouse shooting with 
kings, dines with billionaires and millionaires in exactly the same way that 
Edward VII did a hundred years ago." 
</P>
<P>
One instance of royal obfuscation occurred in 1986 when a sapphire and diamond 
ensemble was omitted from the list of official gifts made to the Prince and 
Princess of Wales by the Sultan of Oman, Morton said. The ensemble, estimated 
to be worth $1.7 million and designated as a private gift, was only admitted to 
exist a year later when the Princess happened to wear them in public, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Morton theorized that this royal reluctance "rightly shows the embarrassment 
they feel" about receiving such lavish gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Like the monarchy itself, the giving of gifts to the royal family is an 
enduring anachronism, Morton said. "I find the psychological and sociological 
aspects of it just fascinating," he said. "Why give to the richest woman in the 
world? . . . In a sense it shows that we're not really that far off from 
primitive tribes, that we live in a global village and that we still look to 
the equivalent of the squire on the hill." 
</P>
<P>
Morton contends, however, that the royal family will not always be able to 
protect its private wealth and enjoy unique privileges. 
</P>
<P>
In his book he notes, "The Windsors have shrewdly used the shield of their 
public duties to construct an armor of legal concessions, ranging from their 
wills to their shares, to deflect the arrows of outrageous inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a question of fine judgment for the royal family -- and ultimately 
Parliament -- about how long their legal and tax advantages, secured by dint of 
their public role, can coexist alongside their increasingly vocal demands to be 
left a lone and treated as ordinary people. Ironically the very success of the 
Windsor dynasty may prove to be its undoing."
