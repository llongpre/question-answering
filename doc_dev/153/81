   The average American woman wears a size 10 to 12
dress, stands 5-foot-3{ and weighs 134 pounds. She has soft body
tone, short, straight, brown hair, and imperfect, untanned skin.
   The average American woman wants to wear a dress two-to-four
sizes smaller, stand an inch taller and weigh 11 pounds less. She
would like more muscles, wavy or curly brown hair and smooth,
tanned skin.
   So says the Gallup Organization's ``national body image
survey,'' which was commissioned by, and described in, American
Health magazine.
   The average American woman thinks men want a woman who wears a
size 8 dress, stands 5-foot-4 and weighs 118 pounds. She thinks
they want a woman with a thin, soft body, long, wavy, blond hair
and tanned, smooth skin.
   The average American man doesn't think much about dress sizes,
but apparently speculates a great deal about the body shape of the
average American woman. He wants one with a full rear-end,
medium-width hips, a small-to-medium waist and medium-sized
breasts. He wants an average body type (not thin), soft body tone
(not muscular), long wavy hair and smooth, tanned skin.
   Now, as to the average American man:
   He is 5-foot-10, 172 pounds, with a lean build, but he wants to
be an inch taller, a pound lighter, more muscular. He thinks she
wants a man who's six feet, 173 pounds, and muscular. In fact, she
wants him the way he wants him: 5-11, 171, muscular. Men think
women like them to have hairy chests, and they're right.
   The poll also found the American woman's zest for thinness is on
the wane. Only 35 percent of women say they'd like a thin body;
about half are satisfied to be of ``average'' weight.
   But Gallup found women still are more weight-conscious than men:
while they would like to lose about 10 pounds each, men on balance
are satisfied with their weight.
   The Gallup Organization said it used a representative national
cross-section of 1,037 adults who were interviewed in person.
   Among the survey's other conclusions:
   _Richer women are lighter and thinner than poorer ones, but rich
men have the biggest waistlines and the broadest shoulders and
chests.
   _Almost two-thirds of college educated women want a more
muscular, ``hard-bodied'' look, compared to 27 percent of those
without a college degree.
