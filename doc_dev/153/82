is determined more by image than reality

NAIM ATTALLAH is wealthy. He must be. He is managing director of Asprey,
jeweller to the vieux riche. He supports out of his own pocket various
worthy but financially challenged ventures such as Quartet Publishing, and
The Literary Review.
But when, many years ago, Attallah arrived in Britain as a near-penniless
Palestinian, few would have given much for his attaining wealth and
influence. Then, even more than now, the English financial establishment was
a closed community.
But young Naim knew what to do. With his few pounds he hired a Rolls-Royce
to take him around the City of London. People were impressed. A Palestinian
driven in a Rolls-Royce was clearly a man of substance: who knew what Arab
connections he might have?
Attallah has never looked back. Of course, he could not have succeeded by
surface charm alone. By all accounts he has a brilliant head for figures,
the sort of man who can make a killing on the foreign exchanges without
recourse to a calculator.
But his story illustrates a point that has become more potent over the
years: that our understanding of wealth is determined more by appearances
than reality. In the old days it was not so. A man was wealthy if he had
land, thousands of acres of it. It was probably inherited. At any rate it
was not borrowed. If anything it was lent to tenants and others less
fortunate.
But now anyone of vigour, by careful wooing of banks with a strange urge to
gamble, can acquire almost overnight the trappings of old money. Of course,
the bankers know that those Landseers, those grouse moors, are theirs. But
the public sees the borrower as the source of wealth and it is in the banks'
interest not to shatter the image.
These illusions of wealth have been greatly aided by the sudden
proliferation of magazines purporting to list the wealthiest businessmen,
with their supposititious net worth neatly printed - usually it is a nice
round number - next to their shiny happy faces.
The most famous in Britain is carried out by Philip Beresford, for the
Sunday Times Magazine. Last year's list had the additional information,
culled from US sources, that the Reichmanns were the fifth richest family in
the world, alongside the Saudi royal family.
When the list was published, it was already painfully clear to the
Reichmanns' myriad bankers that the Canadian property dealers' net worth was
substantial only as a negative quantity. They were that great invention of
20th century financial engineering, minus billionaires.
In the previous year's list, Captain Robert Maxwell was up there near the
very top, at a time when, as we now know, his fortune had totally collapsed.
Subsequently, with disarming honesty, Philip Beresford wrote in the Sunday
Times: 'We didn't take Mr Maxwell's debts into account.' This was rather
like assessing the pros and cons of Britain's membership of the European
exchange rate mechanism without taking into account unemployment.
But one must sympathise with the compilers of such lists. It is far easier
to see a man's assets than his debts; indeed, the indebted rely on this
little secret. Only the most rash and egotistical actually admit it, as
Australia's Alan Bond did in the late 1980s when he stated: 'A man's wealth
is measured by how much he can borrow.'
But even with those who are genuinely rich, the attempt to express their
wealth in a single number is fatuous. Money is only a measurement of value,
and value is akin to mercury, an elusive, volatile substance which makes us
look foolish when we try to capture it. It measures us, rather than the
other way round.
J Paul Getty understood this. Indeed, he sprang to public prominence in 1957
only because he was named as the richest man in the world in the very first
such list, compiled by Fortune magazine. According to one of Getty's
biographers: 'When he heard about the Fortune article Getty told his
brother-in-law, Ware Lynch: 'I don't know how much money I have. I don't
know how they would know'.'
Exactly. It is the mystery of value. Ask any expert. Ask Attallah.
