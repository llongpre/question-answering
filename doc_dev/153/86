<LEADPARA>  Today we celebrate our escape from under the English crown . . . so why not
check in with that fancy piece of headgear, the woman who wears it and the
family she heads?;    First, our founding parents seem to have done their job
with admirable thoroughness. The crown barely exists as a governmental entity.
Its wearer no longer makes laws, collects taxes, makes disparaging remarks
about uppity colonials or commands fleets and armies.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     What she and her relatives do in peacetime is glad-hand dignitaries both
foreign and domestic, give personal support to worthy and/or charitable
causes, operate as flacks and bird dogs for British industry, play polo, amuse
the world's gossip columnists and beguile the kingdom's mostly American
tourists. In wartime, those not constituted to serve in the military wave the
flag.;    In short, the monarchy absolutely is in decline.;    The monarch
herself, however, isn't doing so badly. She probably is the richest woman in
the world . . . or if she isn't, the difference is piddling. The estimates of
her wealth range from $2 billion to $11.5 billion.;    And on the royal cash
flow hangs today's tale.;    The Q not only doesn't collect taxes, she doesn't
pay them either. She doesn't pay income taxes. She doesn't pay inheritance
taxes. She doesn't even pay on capital gains. But a recent poll shows that the
voters, more than 70 percent of them, think she should.;    Curiously, nearly
everyone polled stated the belief that their monarchs never have paid taxes.
That was accepted as the eternal order of life in the British Isles.;    But
as it turns out, it has only been the case for a little more than 50 years.
Monarchs have paid up, going all the way back to Queen Victoria, who by the
time she shuffled off this mortal coil had poured about a half-million pounds
into the tax bucket.;    Victoria's son, King Edward VII, paid his taxes. So
did George V. It was the Q's dad, George VI, on whom the crown fell in 1938
after brother Edward took a running leap at Wallis Warfield Simpson, who
managed to get the monarch exempted from the income tax.;    (So far, no one
who knows has been willing to say how old George pulled this off.);    Now
comes Simon Hughes, a Liberal-Democrat member of Parliament who represents the
London constituency of Southwark and Bermondsey. On Wednesday, he stepped
before Commons and put in a bill that would require the Q to start forking
over.;    But this legislation, despite the opinions reported by pollsters,
isn't likely to succeed. Whatever the reality of the Q's wealth, politics is
still politics. The Tory government does not support Hughes' idea and neither
does the Labor Party. The family's popularity apparently is too well
established.;    Our spies at the scene say the feeling seems to be that a tax
on royalty is a non-issue among the power wielders, if not among the voters.; 
  At least for now.  </TEXT>
