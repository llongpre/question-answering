   A woman's chance of having a Caesarean section
depends more on the size of her bank account than on the difficulty
of her labor, a report today shows.
   Many physicians believe Caesareans are far too widely used, and
the doctor who directed the research said one reason wealthy women
receive them most often may be because of doctors' fear of lawsuits.
   The surgical form of birth is intended for cases where vaginal
birth is difficult or hazardous to the baby. But over the past two
decades, the number of Caesareans has quadrupled, making it the
most common operation in the United States.
   ``The most surprising thing is that one expects poor people to
have many more health problems than rich people,'' said Dr. Jeffrey
B. Gould. ``They have more low birth weight infants and more
neonatal mortality. The notion that rich people are having more
Caesarean sections than poor people is a topsy-turvy finding.''
   Gould directed the research, which was based on the birth
certificates of 245,854 infants born in Los Angeles County in 1982
and 1983. It was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Physicians typically receive bigger fees for Caesareans than for
vaginal births, but Gould said, ``The very simplistic reason that
the rich are rich, and the doctors want to make money is a minor
part of the picture.''
   Instead, the wealthy may be more likely to demand or receive
Caesareans if minor problems arise, because their doctors fear
these patients will take them to court if the baby is less than
perfect when born vaginally.
   In contrast, he said, poor people are more likely to give birth
at big teaching hospitals, where they are cared for by resident
physicians. These young doctors are closely supervised and often
are determined to limit Caesareans to cases in which they are truly
necessary.
   Dr. Benjamin Sachs of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital said, ``A
woman's chances of having a vaginal delivery are in part dependent
on how her obstetrical care is provided.''
   He noted that a wealthy woman is more likely to have a private
physician who ``bounces back and forth'' between his office and the
labor room. In teaching hospitals and health maintenance
organizations, one doctor is typically assigned full time to labor
and delivery, ``so whether she delivers or not, there is no
pressure.''
   Sachs said that because their doctors use Caesareans more
sparingly, poor women may be getting better care than affluent
women.
   Gould's study compared Caesarean rates based on the income of
the neighborhoods where women lived. It found that 23 percent of
pregnant women from areas where family incomes averaged more than
$30,000 received Caesareans, compared with 13 percent of those who
came from places where families made less than $11,000.
   The differences could not be explained by the women's race,
ethnic background, age, number of previous births or the weight of
their babies.
   ``It's a very striking difference,'' said Gould. ``It occurs in
all ethnic groups.''
   Whites were most apt to have Caesareans, and Mexican-Americans
were the least likely, but the Caesarean rate rose steadily with
increasing income in all racial and ethnic groups.
   For instance, 16 percent of black women from areas with income
below $11,000 had Caesareans, compared with 26 percent of blacks
from neighborboods above $30,000.
