   Burglars broke into the London home of the brother
of the Sultan of Brunei and stole $6.5 million worth of jewelry and
cash, police said today.
   Thieves broke in through a first floor window of the house in the
north London district of East Finchley on Thursday in the late
afternoon or evening, said Detective Superintendent David Staff of
Scotland Yard.
   Details of the robbery had been kept secret at the sultan's
request, police said.
   The red-brick house is owned by the sultan's youngest brother,
Prince Jefri, a spokesman for the sultan said, and not by the sultan
himself as The Daily Express, The Daily Telegraph and the domestic
news agency Press Association had earlier reported.
   The sultan is the richest man in the world.
   Staff said the prince's wife, Princess Norhayti, was not home at
the time of the robbery.
   ``No physical violence'' was involved, the officer said, and the
thieves had ``no contact'' with any of the household staff or
security guards. He would not elaborate. Nor would he say whether
the house had been ransacked or if selected items were taken.
   Family lawyer Fred McColl said additional security measures have
been installed, but he would not give details. Asked whether former
employees are being questioned, he replied, ``We are questioning a
number of people.''
   Newspaper reports today said the gang must have had intimate
knowledge of the complex security systems and alarms in the house.
   Brunei, on the northwest coast of the island of Borneo, is rich
in oil and natural gas and the revenues go to the sultan, Sir Muda
Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izuddin Waddaulah, 42, who is also prime
minister and defense minister.
   The sultan's country of less than 250,000 people is a member of
the 48-nation Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies. His
personal fortune is estimated at more than $23 billion.
   The British robbery record is an estimated $48 million from a
safe deposit center in 1987 in London's Knightsbridge district. The
center's owner, Parvez Latiff, and three other men were convicted of
the crime in January and jailed.
