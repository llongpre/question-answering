Oil Barons Top Rich List: The two richest people on the face of the earth are 
oil barons, according to Fortune magazine. Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, 
oil-rich leader of the tiny Pacific sultanate of Brunei, retained Fortune's top 
title for the fourth straight year, with an estimated worth of $25 billion, 
unchanged from 1989. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and clan, a focus of the Persian 
Gulf crisis, ranked second with assets worth $18 billion, also unchanged.
