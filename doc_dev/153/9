<HEAD>Magazine Says Mars Candy Bar Family Richest in America</HEAD>

   The Mars candy-bar clan is worth $12.5 billion,
surpassing the Newhouse publishing dynasty as the richest family in
America, Fortune magazine reports.
   If Fortune's estimate is correct, the worth of the Marses could
buy about 25 billion regular-size Snickers bars, which if laid end
to end would circle the planet Mars nearly 32 times.
   The magazine's calculation is more than any previous estimate of
the wealth of the secretive family, which shuns publicity about
itself and its candy bar company, maker of Snickers and M&amp;Ms.
   ``Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is
as loose with information as its McLean, Va., neighbor, the CIA,''
Fortune said Wednesday in an advance press release about its 1988
Billionaires List, to be carried in the Sept. 12 issue available on
newsstands next Monday.
   The magazine said it based the estimate of the Marses' wealth on
what comparable food concerns have sold for recently.
   ``Thus, Forrest Mars and his three children, Forrest Jr., John
and Jacqueline, overtake the Newhouse publishing magnates as the
richest Americans,'' Fortune said.
   Still, the Marses rank No. 3 on Fortune's worldwide list. The
richest remains the Sultan of Brunei, whose oil wealth makes him
worth $25 billion. Next is King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and family,
worth $18 billion.
   Fourth is Britain's Queen Elizabeth II with $8.7 billion; next
is the Newhouses, whose communications holdings are worth $8
billion; in sixth place is retail king Sam Walton, founder of
Wal-Mart stores, and family, worth $7.4 billion; seventh is
Canada's Reichmann family, with $6.3 billion in assets that range
from swank New York real estate to interests in railroads and
utilities.
   Eighth is Kenneth Irving and family, a Canadian clan that owns
400 companies worth $6.2 billion; ninth is Kenneth Thomson and
family, Canadian owners of a publishing, retailing, energy and real
estate empire worth $6 billion; and in 10th place is Gerald
Grosvenor and family, British land barons worth $5.4 billion.
   Of the 129 individuals and nuclear families that comprise this
year's list, there are 51 in the United States, 38 in Europe, 19 in
Asia _ including 12 Japanese _ 13 Arabs and eight others, Fortune
said.
