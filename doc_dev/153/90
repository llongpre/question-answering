FOR THOSE who enjoy a little vulgarity, the behaviour of the rich in the
1990s is a marked disappointment. What a contrast with the 1980s when, in
the words of Ronald Reagan's first budget director David Stockman, 'the hogs
were really feeding.' It wasn't just the hogs.
The Trumps were trumping, the Milkens milking, the Goldsmiths greenmailing
and Thatcher's entrepreneurial children were jumping joyfully from the play
pen. Even at this short distance the 1980s look the finest years for
would-be nouveaux riches since the forebears of many of today's ducal
families grew fat on the dissolution of the monasteries.
The billionaires and millionaires who are making the headlines in the 1990s
are a notably more austere bunch. George Soros, the high-minded
philosopher-speculator who found the fault lines in the European exchange
rate mechanism and recycled the British taxpayer's money to Bosnian Moslems
and needy Hungarians; Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft and richest bachelor
in the US, whose recent decision to marry one of his managers shows no sign
of transforming him from a computer-world frog into glamour-world prince;
David Sainsbury, one-time backer of Britain's Social Democratic Party,
charitable donor and eponymous chairman of the food retailing group that
remains one of Britain's most remorseless money-making machines. The
tricoteuses of the French Revolution - who knitted as the tumbrils rolled -
would scarcely have known what to make of them.
The new austere tendency, if that is what it is, has nothing to do with any
wave of popular feeling against the rich. If anything, the extraordinary
feature of the past dozen years has been the lack of any serious backlash on
the part of the world's underdogs, despite the failure of First World wealth
to trickle to the Third.
Numerous poor countries have suffered a protracted decline in the price of
the commodity exports on which their economies depended. And within
individual countries, notably in Latin America, the trickle down theory of
economics failed to work because so much of the money trickled out in
capital flight, as the rich tried to escape the depredations of incompetent
or corrupt politicians.
Yet the political response to impoverishment has increasingly been to adopt
the prevailing ideology of the developed world: the market. The result in
Latin America, once the home of dependency theory and the economics of
despair, has been that capital, both native and foreign, has trickled back
to finance an unprecedented experiment in liberal economics. Meantime the
dragon economies of Asia have reasserted the merits of self-help in
spectacular style. Their millionaires are busily exporting a uniquely potent
brand of workaholic materialism to the ramshackle economy of China.
In the developed - and more especially the English-speaking - world, the
present sober condition of the rich is no more than a natural evolution from
the ideological 1980s. The Reagan-Thatcher years delivered lower marginal
tax rates, financial liberalisation, balance of payment deficits and buoyant
stock markets. For the first time in recent memory the political culture
turned pro-business. And in this frothy, consumption-led cycle, the service
industries - finance, advertising, entertainment, trophy wives - boomed as
never before.
Bejewelled dames apart, these were not commodity-intensive pursuits. And
those manufacturing industries that did flourish in the 1980s, such as
computing, relied not on expensive commodities like metals, but on a cheap
form of sand called silicon. Hence the poor performance of the less
developed countries in the prolonged recovery of the 1980s.
But the rich of the developed world are now infected by the curse of the
Third World nations: since economic activity was financed in the previous
decade by unprecedented resort to borrowing, much of the First World has
suffered a debt-induced recession.
The new millionaires have thus been culled not by sans culottes, but by the
laws of financial gravity; and the extent of their financial and ethical
misdeeds, rather than the nature and substance of their particular business,
has been the chief determinant of their fate.
Witness how printer and publisher Robert Maxwell, scourge of the widows and
orphans, succumbed to the grim reaper; Michael Milken of junk bond fame to
the zealous prosecutor; Asil Nadir of the fruit-to-fraud conglomerate Polly
Peck to the administrative receiver, if not to the courts. Meanwhile,
entertainment figures such as Andrew Lloyd Webber, Mick Jagger and Paul
McCartney, representatives of one of the frothiest of all service
industries, are alive, and well and very rich.
The attrition has been worst in property, an industry that has a peculiar
knack of exposing the banking fraternity's propensity for collective
aberration. For those of envious disposition, one of the most satisfying
falls from grace has been that of US real estate man Donald Trump. He it was
who, in a moment of intense hubris, wrote an improving tract called The Art
of the Deal.
The 1990s demonstrated that the only artistry in his balance sheet was pure
trompe l'oeil. Others whose art proved similarly insubstantial were the
Reichmann brothers of Canada, Godfrey Bradman and Trevor Osborne in the UK
and the frenetic Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond.
Bond, like US junk bond financier Michael Milken and arbitrageur Ivan
Boesky, found that one of the squares on the Monopoly board said 'Go To
Jail.' Gerald Ronson, the property man jailed for his role in the share
scandal surrounding the Guinness takeover of Distillers, was another to make
that discovery.
Yet so persuasive is Ronson in dealing with his bankers that he has achieved
the unique distinction of being the first man to combine de facto bankruptcy
with millionaire status. His recently agreed pay package, which includes an
annual salary of Pounds 500,000 indexed against inflation, is estimated to
be worth more than Pounds 4.4m over five years - an astonishing reward for
one who brought one of the world's biggest private companies to its knees,
even though he built it originally.
At least Ronson's outfit is a private concern. The quickest path to riches
in recent years has been for the directors of quoted companies to wreck the
business after taking the elementary precaution of demanding the longest
possible contract. This ensures hefty compensation for loss of office at the
shareholders' expense.
Many who have failed to wreck their companies have been equally shameless in
paying themselves risk-free fortunes regardless of performance. Still more
have milked the pension fund by manipulating pre-retirement salaries. This
exploitation of slack accountability in the Anglo-Saxon financial system is
a gravy train that rolls on regardless of recession. Why on earth do
institutional shareholders, in effect the legal owners of the corporate
sector, allow it to continue?
The biggest loser of recent years has been Old Money. According to an index
compiled by the agents Savills, the value of agricultural land at the end of
last year had fallen in real terms to a mere 37 per cent of its value at the
start of the 1980s. As Savills' Bertie Ross points out, there have been
off-sets against this fall in values, such as big productivity improvements
in farming and surpluses from planning gains on development land.
But for the really big landlords with holdings in commercial property as
well, there has been a double bind. While equities have generated
unprecedentedly high returns, commercial property has been one of the worst
performing investment categories of the past dozen years. Investment
Property Databank's index indicates that the capital value of commercial
property has fallen by more than 30 per cent in real terms since 1980.
Since many of the older aristocratic estates are averse to borrowing, the
attrition is long term and will be felt mainly when property is passed from
one generation to another. Yet for Queen Elizabeth II, the pain is more
immediate, in that any capital loss will be compounded by her new settlement
with the tax man - conscience money, in the eyes of the tabloid press, for
the colourful ways of the younger members of her family.
For less regal landed estates, an unexpected twist has come from John
Major's government, in the shape of legislation to enfranchise leaseholders.
This assault on property rights gives new meaning to Keynes's phrase about
the euthanasia of the rentier.
It has also caused the Duke of Westminster, Britain's biggest landowner
after the Queen, to resign from the Tory party in protest. But does anyone
care much any more when the highest in the land discover that they are
downwardly mobile? What, come to that, is the point of the rich? Are they
really doing their stuff?
The bien pensants of the 18th century had no difficulty with these
questions. As Dr Johnson put it: 'You cannot spend money in luxury without
doing good to the poor. Nay, you do more good to them by spending it in
luxury than by giving it; for by spending it in luxury you make them exert
industry, whereas by giving it you keep them idle.'
Unfortunately (if you share the Johnsonian point of view) the spending power
of the rich is too small, nowadays, to offset the rise in the savings of the
masses that brought about the recession. From an economic point of view, the
very rich are not very relevant.
A more political justification comes from those who trumpet the merits of
maintaining a class of people who are rich enough to stand up to the
powerful and to stand down on matters of principle. An unlikely apologist of
this ilk was the post-war Labour leader Clement Attlee. It was he who said
of the Cecil dynasty in the Tory party: 'Cecils don't give a damn, and that
makes a lot of difference.'
Certainly it is striking that the only high-profile, voluntary departures
from ministerial office in recent years in Britain have not come from those
like Major or Norman Lamont who made the biggest mistakes, but from those
who made or inherited the most money. Michael Heseltine could well afford,
in a purely financial sense, to resign over the Westland saga; and former
defence minister Alan Clark could equally afford to resign over . . . no one
is quite sure what.
Yet Heseltine all too transparently does care about his own advancement in
politics, which is presumably the mark of new money. Clark, in contrast,
appears not to care about high office, but has left less of a mark on
politics than on the lives of those who were acquitted in the
Matrix-Churchill arms-for-Iraq affair, where his candour about Whitehall
duplicity prevented serious injustice.
For a better example of what a rich maverick can do in politics, one has to
look to the US and to Ross Perot, that peculiarly American version of the
Socratic gadfly. But while Perot unquestionably enlivened last year's
presidential election and continues to stir the debate on the US budget
deficit, he holds no office and smacks too much of the quack to bear
comparison with the Cecils.
Even then, the striking thing about the last politically influential Cecil,
the fifth Marquess of Salisbury, was the ineffectiveness of his principled
departure from politics. He bowed out after attacking the colonial
secretary, Iain MacLeod, for his conduct of Britain's retreat from empire.
Yet the resulting battle in the Tory party petered out without causing
lasting damage or securing political change. History's verdict would seem to
favour the meritocrat rather than the aristocrat on both the point at issue
and MacLeod's subsequent career, which took him to the cabinet as a sadly
short-lived chancellor of the exchequer.
That leaves a more subtle and provocative case for the rich, advanced by the
libertarian philosopher Friedrich Hayek. Hayek argued not only that people
of independent means are essential for the preservation of competitive
enterprise, but that the rich are even more valuable when pursuing aims that
bring no material return. In a majoritarian democracy, he argued, the state
simply cannot provide sufficient diversity of patronage in arts, education,
politics, morals and religion.
There would even, he adds, be a strong case for selecting at random one in
1,000 and endowing them with fortunes to dispose of at whim; but since
inheritance is already random, and those who inherit wealth less prone to
the grosser pleasures than the newly rich, inheritance will do very nicely
instead.
For Hayek, such a system justifies itself even if a mere handful of these
inheritors spends in a beneficial manner, because waste, however shocking,
is the price of freedom. And measured by this undemanding criterion, the
present-day rich are clearly doing a splendid job.
In less fiscally stressful times the British government might have put up
the money for the National Gallery's Sainsbury wing. But it would surely
have had misgivings about the superb Saatchi gallery in St John's Wood,
which embraces the kind of contemporary art that can sometimes embarrass
government ministers.
Nor would any government be likely to put the taxpayers' money into prizes
for religious research, as the octogenarian fund manager Sir John Templeton
has done.
The pluralist's response might be that the rich are not as diverse, in their
tastes, as they might be; and that Hayek underestimates the diversity of the
wonderfully imperfect democratic process. Ken Livingstone's Greater London
Council might not have been every libertarian philosopher's ideal - though
Livingstone is closer to the anarchist than the authoritarian wing of the
Labour Party - but it backed far wilder ventures, artistic and otherwise, in
its time, than most private millionaire patrons would wish to contemplate.
Even a quango like the Arts Council can be astonishingly and quirkily
creative  - or destructive - under the direction of such lords as Keynes,
Goodman or Rees-Mogg.
That said, in a world marked by structural budget deficits, the 19th century
campaigners who were able, thanks to a sufficiency, to abolish slavery,
reform the prisons and bring humanity to the treatment of the insane, are
almost certainly due for a late 20th century renaissance. Perhaps, also, as
university funding is squeezed, are the gentlemen scholars like Darwin, de
Tocqueville or Henry Adams, and the recipients of patronage like Marx.
Love them or hate them, millionaires are the only people in the straightened
1990s who can fill many of the intellectual, cultural and social gaps left
by a state that is in obligatory retreat. The rich, of necessity, are always
with us.
