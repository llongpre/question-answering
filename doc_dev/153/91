   Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 63rd birthday
Friday by conferring honorary colonel in chief titles on two of her
children and two relatives by marriage.
   The title honors an army regiment's achievements by giving it
contact with Buckingham Palace and occasional visits by a royal
figurehead.
   It was the first such title for the queen's second son Prince
Andrew, an active naval officer, and for the Staffordshire Regiment
which he now heads.
   Princess Anne's title was for the London Officer Training Corps
which links London University and the army. She has 10 similar
titles for regiments in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
   The queen's daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, who already held
the title for a British and a Canadian regiment, gained her third
to head the 13th-18th Hussars.
   Its 270-year history spans the 1815 battle of Waterloo, the 1854
charge of the Light Brigade, the Boer War relief of Ladysmith in
1900 and the World War II invasion of Normandy in 1944.
   The Duchess of Gloucester, whose husband is a cousin of the
queen, was made colonel in chief of the Royal Irish Rangers.
   The queen is colonel in chief of 36 regiments.

   Indiana rocker John Cougar Mellencamp
grabbed his car phone as soon as he heard one of the songs from his
soon-to-be-released album being played too early on the radio.
   Mellencamp called Dick Asher, president of Polgram, his record
company, and had him obtain a court order to keep cuts from the
album ``Big Daddy'' off the air.
   Indianapolis radio station WFBQ-FM was playing a different cut
each hour Wednesday even though the official release date is May 4.
   ``Sometimes it's worth breaking the rules a little for an
exclusive, but once we got the cease-and-desist we were legally
obligated to stop playing it,'' said WFBQ program director Michael
Hughes. ``It's just a case of the wrong people _ John himself _
actually hearing it.''

   Entertainer John Denver flew off in
another plane shortly after walking away from his damaged biplane
after landing here.
   The accident occurred after Denver's plane landed Thursday
afternoon on a flight from Carefree, Ariz., to Santa Fe, N.M., with
only Denver aboard, police and Federal Aviation Administration
officials said.
   Denver declined medical treatment and later left on another
plane, Holbrook police spokeswoman Mary Benavidez said.
   An FAA duty officer in Los Angeles said he understood Denver's
plane was damaged when it spun around horizontally, possibly after
being blown by a gust of wind, while taxiing after landing.
   The duty officer, who declined to give his name, said the plane
on which Denver continued his trip to Santa Fe probably was a
charter arranged after the accident.
   Denver's plane was a Waco biplane built in 1931, the duty
officer said. He said he didn't know details of the damage.

   Larry King, a radio and television personality,
says he loves women and smoking.
   ``I love women but I'm not in love with any particular woman,
and, despite my reputation, I'm not a womanizer,'' King, 55, is
quoted as saying in the May issue of Lear's magazine. ``Womanizers
don't like women, I think.''
   King, who conducts radio and televison interview programs, also
told magazine editor Frances Lear that he has regretfully given up
smoking since a heart attack. ``Smoking is one of the all-time
great habits,'' he said.
   ``Better than fooling around?'' asked Lear.
   ``I think you're terrific, Frances,'' said King.
   ``Thanks, Larry,'' said Lear. ``So are you.''

   Never mind that most critics consider
Jon Bon Jovi the musical equivalent of the Alaska oil spill. He
says he'll just revel in popular adulation and duck the harpoons.
   Bon Jovi, 27, and his band of the same name, have layered muted
heavy metal music with melodies in such albums as ``Slippery When
Wet,'' which sold 9 million copies in the United States, and ``New
Jersey,'' 4 million.
   With sales like that, you can let the critics take their shots.
   ``I realize that America loves success, and they hate successful
people,'' Bon Jovi, 27, said Tuesday.
   ``Take Mike Tyson, for example. The man's an amazing fighter. I
went to Vegas, I was at the fight. I was screaming for Frank Bruno.
One, because he's a friend of mine, and, two, I wanted Tyson to get
beat.
   ``You read all this stuff in the press about his wife and Don
King, you say, `Oh, man, knock him out, it'll humble him and it
will be great.'
   ``Then I thought, `You're saying it about yourself.' You get to
the top of the heap and people throw stuff at you and you wonder
why.''
   Still, he says he's content to duck and keep grinning.
   ``I don't feel trapped by success. I tell you what _ I dig the
view. Anybody who tells you they don't dig the view is full of it.''
