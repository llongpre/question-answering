   Writer Dominick Dunne spends his life rubbing
elbows with the rich and powerful and telling their secrets _ and
his own _ to the world.
   His novel, ``People Like Us,'' which has been adapted as a
two-part TV miniseries on NBC, looks at affluent people publicly
flaunting their wealth early in the past decade. It also serves as
a means for him to deal with his own desire for revenge for the
murder of his daughter.
   An earlier novel, ``The Two Mrs. Grenvilles,'' was an NBC
miniseries in 1987. His newest book, ``An Inconvenient Woman,'' is
due to be published this month.
   ``The parts in `People Like Us' that deal with my own life
involve Gus Bailey and Peach, his wife,'' says Dunne. ``That's
taken from my own life, and it's emphasized more in the miniseries
than in the book. The part that deals with New York society has
composite characters for libel reasons.''
   His daughter, actress Dominique Dunne, was killed by her former
boyfriend in Los Angeles in 1982 shortly after she had completed
her first movie, ``Poltergeist.'' The former boyfriend accused of
strangling her was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and was
released from prison after 6{ years.
   In ``People Like Us,'' which will be televised Sunday and
Monday, Gus Bailey goes to a prison hearing for his daughter's
convicted killer and shoots the man.
   ``I've never shot anybody,'' Dunne says. ``Let me explain that.
If you go through what I went through, losing my daughter, you have
strong, strong feelings of revenge. If you're an intelligent person
you know you can't seek revenge in that way.
   ``But as a novelist I could create a situation in which I could
do in the book what I couldn't do in real life. I intended for Gus
to kill the guy. But when I got to that part I couldn't write it.
He wounds him and goes to prison himself for a couple of years.''
   Dunne says writing the book helped him deal with his own
feelings about his daughter's killing. He is on the board of the
National Victims Association, which he says is working to gain
rights for victims equal to those of the accused killers.
   Dunne is also a contributing editor of Vanity Fair, an
arrangement that began when the magazine's editor, Tina Brown,
encouraged him to keep a journal during the trial of his daughter's
killer. That was published in the April 1983 issue and became the
first chapter in a collection of his Vanity Fair pieces called
``Fatal Charms.''
   The ``People Like Us'' miniseries stars Ben Gazarra as Gus
Bailey and Jean Simmons as Peach, plus Connie Sellecca, Eva Marie
Saint, Dennis Farina, Teri Polo, Beatrice Straight, Paul Williams
and Gary Frank.
   ``I was trying to make a comment on that period during the
Reagan years when the rich went so public and flaunted their
money,'' Dunne says. ``It was a pretty disgusting period. It was
fascinating to watch, but you have to say, `What's going on here?'
People were living on the streets. I have no problem with people
having money and spending it. It's the flaunting of it. It's pretty
much calmed down.''
   Dunne is a former president of Four Star, the television
production company founded by David Niven, Dick Powell and Charles
Boyer. Later, he produced such movies as ``The Boys in the Band,''
``The Panic in Needle Park,'' ``Ash Wednesday'' and ``Play It As it
Lays,'' adapted from a novel written by his sister-in-law, Joan
Didion. His brother is writer John Gregory Dunne.
   His new book, ``An Inconvenient Woman,'' is about the powerful
and the rich of Los Angeles, he says. ``It has to do with the
cover-up of a murder here. It will probably make me as unpopular
with the people in L.A. But I didn't get upset when people in New
York got mad at me over `People Like Us.'''
   Dunne is a latecomer to writing. He started his first book when
he was 50 and didn't get published until he was 53.
   ``I had a very interesting career, but like all show business
careers it had its ups and downs,'' he says. ``I began to get inner
feelings that this wasn't it. There was more to get out of me than
I was giving. One of the things as a producer that I was good at
was working with writers. I had a knack for telling a writer how to
make a script work.
   ``It never occurred to me that I could do this myself. But one
year my writer got an Emmy for a script that I practically told him
how to write. So, once I had the kids out of college, I said that's
it. I moved to Oregon and wrote for six months. My first book, `The
Winners,' was a flop. My first success was `The Two Mrs.
Grenvilles.'''
