<LEADPARA>  According to a recent study at Georgetown University, less than 0.04 percent
of couples in the United States follow the church's teaching on family
planning as set forth in "Humanae Vitae." Worldwide, that figure rises to a
little over 5 percent of the population, according to the World Health
Organization.;    It seems rather ridiculous, therefore, for Pierre Bierre
(Letters, May 13) to attribute the causes of poverty to Pope Paul VI's
encyclical. It appears much more reasonable to examine the attitudes toward
wealth -- who has it, who doesn't have it and what steps we take as a nation
and a society to care for one another.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     That there is no universal health care program in the richest nation on
Earth is not a matter of population but rather a matter of where we put our
priorities. That prenatal care for the poor and marginalized is simply not
available or too costly in many areas is not a matter of population but rather
a matter of racism.;    That the income of the majority of women who, after
divorce, are the care-givers for their children falls below the poverty line
while their former husband's income rises by 43 percent is not a matter of
population but rather a matter of legislation.;    That governments worldwide
have made conscious decisions to starve certain segments of their population
is not a matter of population but rather a matter of ideology.;    Had the
world understood and absorbed the teaching of "Humanae Vitae" and, later on,
Pope John Paul II's "Apostolic Exhortation on the Family," with its call to
strengthen family life and to accept the dignity and integrity of woman as
woman, we might find ourselves with healthier families, stronger nations, more
peaceful lives and more equitable distribution of our world's resources.;
