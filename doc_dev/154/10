   A slight earthquake jolted the San Francisco
Bay area, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   The quake, which struck at 11:16 p.m. PST Friday, registered 3.6
on the Richter scale and was centered four miles north of San
Leandro, said Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman for the United States
Geological Survey in Menlo Park. San Leandro is southwest of
Oakland, in the so-called East Bay suburban area.
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, said
police and fire spokesmen in San Francisco and Oakland.
   The temblor wasn't technically considered an aftershock to the
Oct. 17, magnitude-7.1 quake that devastated the region, said Tom
Flynn, a spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Services. The
big quake was on the San Andreas fault, centered 55 miles south of
San Francisco; San Leandro is east of San Francisco.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
