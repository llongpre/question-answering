   One of California's main interstate highways
reopened Friday, but conditions were messy following a winter storm
that stranded motorists, caused as many as 50 trucks to jackknife
and was blamed for at least two deaths.
   Also Friday, hurricane-force winds abated in Northern California,
where power was knocked out to more than 575,000 electric customers
and at least three children died.
   The California Highway Patrol began escorting cars over the
summit of Interstate 5 on the 4,500-foot Tejon Pass north of Los
Angeles, but sleet continued to force intermittent closings along
the heavily traveled north-south route. No injuries were reported.
   The National Weather Service forecast continuing rain, with snow
in the mountains.
   Traffic on Interstate 15 through the 4,400-foot Cajon Pass 55
miles east of Los Angeles moved faster when snow and wind subsided,
authorities said.
   Two people were killed early Thursday in the numerous accidents
that occurred when the storm descended on Cajon Pass, a major route
between Southern California and Arizona.
   On the central coast, Highway 101 in San Luis Obispo County was
reopened for drivers who were stuck on each side of icy Cuesta Grade
since Thursday.
   Motorists filled up motels and inns Thursday night when traffic
ground to a halt on Highway 101 because of a rare snowfall.
   Shelters prepared for another night of providing for the
homeless. Hotel vouchers were handed out in Los Angeles and a
recreation center and armory were opened. Two armories opened in
Orange County.
   Some snow-starved Southern Californians abandoned work and headed
for the ski slopes, said resort operators at Big Bear Lake in the
San Bernardino Mountains and at Wrightwood in the San Gabriel
Mountains.
   ``It's snowing like crazy up here, we're just having a ball,''
said Richard Conger, spokesman for the Mountain High ski spot at
Wrightwood.
   In Northern California, residents and authorities began to clean
up in the wake of the ferocious north winds that damaged boats and
airplanes, downed power lines and trees and fanned dozens of brush
fires.
   In an affluent Santa Rosa neighborhood, nine homes were destroyed
or badly damaged by fire and three mobile homes were badly damaged
by trees.
   ``I felt like I was in an earthquake all night. When I went
outside to prop up a fence, the wind literally picked me up off the
ground. I mean, I was airborne,'' said LoMae Mathis in Sonoma, about
30 miles north of San Francisco, recalling the winds that began
Wednesday night.
   The high winds, which gusted to 102 mph atop Mount Diablo,
knocked out power to homes in northern and central California.
   Oli Asghar, 3, died in a Berkeley apartment fire Thursday that
was sparked by a candle. His parents and three brothers and sisters
were left homeless, fire officials said.
   In Pittsburg, 30 miles north, 6-year-old Mounkoun Lee died late
Wednesday night of smoke inhalation after being trapped inside his
family's burning home. His 5-year-old sister, Angela, died at
Children's Hospital Thursday night.
