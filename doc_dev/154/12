   Here is a county-by-county summary of death, injury and damage
reports from the Oct. 17 earthquake as gathered from the California
Office of Emergency Services, other agencies and reporters:
   ALAMEDA COUNTY (Oakland and communities east of San Francisco
Bay) _ Mile-and-a-quarter-long section of upper deck of Interstate
880 in Oakland collapsed, with 39 bodies recovered from the
wreckage so far.
   The entire viaduct will be razed, even the part that did not
collapse, and rebuilt to standards designed to withstand
earthquakes, transportation officials say. I-880, built for $10.2
million in 1957, was the state's first elevated freeway.
   The County Office of Emergency Services said 2,550 people were
left homeless. The OES reported Oakland suffered 95 percent of the
county's 349 injuries and $1.5 billion-plus in damages. In all, the
office said 264 businesses, including nine residential hotels, and
1,517 homes were damaged and at least 11 buildings destroyed.
Damage to Oakland port facilities estimated $105 million.
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Twelve deaths including one in Bay Bridge
collapse, 300 injured and treated at hospitals, an undetermined
number who sustained less serious injuries. The OES said 1,100
people were homeless. Damages estimated at $2.5 billion, and Mayor
Art Angos says total could be more than $3 billion.
   Sixty residential buildings were destroyed in the Marina
district. In preliminary reports, 250 buildings in the city are
described as unsafe and up to 1,000 need extensive repairs. Damage
to public buildings is estimated at $388 million, and the total to
public property $512 million.
   The Bay Bridge, the main link between the city and Oakland, is
shut until at least Nov. 16 for repairs. The elevated Embarcadero
Freeway will be closed for about three months, officials said.

eighty-two injuries, damage estimated at $350 million, 600 homes
damaged, three businesses destroyed and 637 damaged.

$160 million. Capitola, Scotts Valley and Boulder Creek also

   The quake's 7.1 epicenter was located in a state park in the
Santa Cruz Mountains, triggering landslides and touching off fires.
