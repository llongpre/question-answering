   Summary of developments related to the California earthquake:

<NOTE>DAMAGE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake may turn out to be the most expensive natural
disaster in U.S. history, with state officials putting the current
estimate at $5.5 billion. The 1906 earthquake and fire in San
Francisco cost as much as $5.8 billion in current dollars,
according to the Independent Insurance Agents of America.
   The American Red Cross says at least 729 homes and residential
buildings were destroyed and 4,950 others damaged along 75 miles of
the San Andreas Fault. The state Office of Emergency Services said
6,568 people remained displaced Saturday, 4,500 in Santa Cruz
County.

<NOTE>CASUALTIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Stunned rescuers pulled a 57-year-old longshoreman alive from
the debris of I-880 Saturday, long after most had given up hope of
finding survivors. Buck Helm, the first person rescued alive since
Tuesday night, was rushed to a local hospital suffering a serious
chest injury but doctors said he was not in imminent danger.
   Fifty-five deaths have been confirmed, with the toll expected to
grow as more bodies are pulled out of the wreckage where I-880
collapsed. Officials said 34 bodies had been pulled from the I-880
rubble by Saturday, with dozens of missing people expected to be
counted among the victims; elsewhere in Northern California, at
least 21 people have been killed.
   The state OES reports that 3,011 people were injured in eight
counties of Northern California. Thirty Red Cross shelters were
housing up to 5,000 people Saturday.

   The earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, registered 6.9 on the
Richter scale, and was centered on the San Andreas Fault 14 miles
northeast of Santa Cruz and 57 miles south of San Francisco n the
Santa Cruz Mountains. Scientists pinpointed the epicenter in the
northeast corner of the Nisene Marks State Park, near the top of
Aptos Creek.
   More than 2,000 aftershocks have been recorded, including one of
5.2 that came 40 minutes after the initial quake. Fourteen

causing moderate damage. Seismologists say aftershocks will be felt
for several months.

   The San Francisco Earthquake and Relief Assistance Hotline,
1-900-500-HELP, was established Friday. It offers callers news
updates, American Red Cross information such as shelter locations
and blood banks, status of transportation and utility systems,
state and federal government information and survival tips.
