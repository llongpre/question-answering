   A sharp earthquake shook the San Francisco
Bay area for 10 seconds early today, breaking glass, causing rock
slides and apparently prompting a man to jump to his death from a
fifth-story window, authorities said.
   The quake, measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale, occurred at 1:13
a.m. and was centered on the San Andreas Fault about 13 miles south
of San Jose, said the U.S. Geological Survey. It was felt as far as
San Luis Obispo, 230 miles south of here.
   No major damage was reported.
   The quake struck as state and federal emergency officials were
about to begin a two-day test of earthquake communications
procedures. The drill involved a mock earthquake in the Bay area in
which 5,000 people die.
   ``It felt like I was having my bed rolled around on a
skateboard. I woke up and I was moving,'' said Henry J. Peterson of
Santa Clara, next to San Jose.
   Two aftershocks measuring 4.2 and 4.5 rippled through the area
later this morning. State officials warned there could be more
quakes in northern California in the next five days, with a quake
up to 6.2 possible but not likely.
   In Los Gatos, 50 miles south of San Francisco, a 19-year-old man
was apparently startled awake by the earthquake and jumped out of
his bedroom window, police dispatcher Lisa Douglas said in a
statement.
   The shaking sent rocks tumbling onto highways, said a Santa Cruz
County Sheriff's Department emergency dispatcher who declined to
give her name. ``They cleared the debris by hand and all roads are
now cleared,'' she said.
   ``There was some damage in the Santa Cruz Mountains,'' said San
Jose police Officer Jay Forbes. ``It was mainly broken windows and
mirrors. Nothing serious.''
   The false ceiling in a vacant Los Gatos business came down, and
half a dozen businesses reported broken windows, police said.
   ``I felt a little rumble and then all the windows started
shaking real bad,'' said Chris Soliday, a clerk at an all-night
convenience store in Sunnyvale. ``Some stuff in the aisles fell
down. There's broken glass, dented cans, some beer bottles broken.''
   The epicenter was in almost exactly the same place as a 5.0
quake on June 27, 1988, said USGS geophysicist Dave Oppenheimer.
   Residents shaken awake by the temblor described it as jolting
and rolling.
   ``It was the strongest I've ever felt,'' said Bernie Beck, 38,
who lives in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district.
   ``I live in an old building that was built after the 1906 quake,
and it really had me going,'' Beck said. ``It felt like you were
sitting on a saw horse, rocking back and forth.''
   San Francisco's Great Quake, which occurred in 1906 before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3. Recent
estimates say more than 2,000 people died in the quake and the fire
it touched off, which burned much of the city.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of
6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in Alaska
hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.
