In between emergency responses from our fire station, I watched the heroic 
efforts of our brother and sister firefighters in San Francisco as they 
attempted to suppress the fires and rescue people trapped in structures. The 
mayor had put out a call for all off-duty fire fighting personnel to 
immediately report to their fire stations.

<P>
While watching the coverage, my mind kept drifting back to an obscure article I 
had read earlier in the day. This article described how San Francisco Mayor Art 
Agnos had reduced the San Francisco Fire Department staffing by 76 positions 
four months earlier. I kept waiting for someone to ask Agnos about these 
reductions, but no questions were forthcoming.

<P>
There is no doubt that the remaining personnel of the San Francisco Fire 
Department would give their all during this major disaster, but when the dust 
is settled, I am sure they will ask Agnos if he still feels the same way about 
his cuts in the fire department -- and I can't wait to hear his answer!
