<NOTE>THE QUAKE AND AFTERSHOCKS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. PDT, registered 7.1 on the
Richter scale and was centered on the San Andreas Fault 15 miles
northeast of Santa Cruz and 56 miles south of San Francisco in the
Santa Cruz Mountains.
   More than 4,500 aftershocks had been recorded, including one of
5.2 that came 40 minutes after the initial quake. There have been
20 of 4.0 or stronger, considered capable of causing moderate
damage.

<NOTE>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed a $3.45 billion disaster aid package, with
most of it destined for Northern California.
   The immediate expenditure of $122 million in state funds to aid
local governments has been ordered by Gov. George Deukmejian, who
says a special session of the Legislature will be called to
consider a temporary increase in sales or gasoline tax to finance
relief.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has received 21,400
applications so far.
   The Red Cross said Friday it has collected $5 million in
contributions; it has a goal of $20 million.

<NOTE>WORLD SERIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Game 3 of baseball's World Series, canceled when the quake
struck, was played Friday night in Candlestick Park. The Oakland
Athletics won 13-7 to take a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
Game 4 is scheduled Saturday, again in San Francisco.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HIGHWAY CLOSURES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   With several missing links in the highway system, most notably
the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and a stretch of I-880 in
Oakland, most commuters face longer and slower rides. Target date
to reopen the bridge is Nov. 16; rebuilding I-880 and other roads
will take much longer.
   The Embarcadero Freeway (I-480) along San Francisco's waterfront
is closed because of severe cracking.
