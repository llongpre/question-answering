   Fifty-four deaths have been confirmed, with the toll expected to
grow as more bodies are pulled out of the wreckage where I-880
collapsed. Officials said Friday that 33 bodies had been pulled
from the I-880 rubble, with dozens of missing people expected to be
counted among the victims; elsewhere in Northern California, at
least 21 people have been killed.

counties of Northern California; a state hospital association said
2,750 were treated but only 250 were hospitalized.

   The earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, registered 6.9 on the
Richter scale, and was centered on the San Andreas Fault 10 miles
northeast of Santa Cruz and 20 miles south of San Jose in the Santa
Cruz Mountains.
   More than 1,500 aftershocks have been recorded, including one of
5.2 that came 40 minutes after the initial quake. A dozen
aftershocks have registered at least 4.0, considered capable of
causing moderate damage.

<NOTE>FEDERAL ASSISTANCE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush toured the devastated area Friday. He has signed
a disaster relief declaration for seven Bay-area counties and
authorized an initial $273 million. House Speaker Tom Foley said
the House would vote to provide the estimated $2.5 billion needed
in federal aid in a stopgap money bill that comes up on Tuesday.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday it will open
20 assistance centers, including 10 Sunday, to process applications
from victims.

<NOTE>WORLD SERIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said the World Series between
the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants is tentatively
scheduled to resume Tuesday at Candlestick Park, where the quake
hit as Game 3 was about to be played, pending final approval by
Mayor Art Agnos this weekend. Times for the remaining games have
not been announced.
   Both the A's and Giants say few people have asked for refunds,
although ticket brokers say the price for scalped tickets has been
dropping.

<NOTE>HIGHWAY CLOSURES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge closed for up to three months
after one section collapsed. Nimitz Freeway (I-880) from the Bay
Bridge south to downtown Oakland. Embarcadero Freeway (I-480) in
San Francisco closed until June because of severe cracking but will
not be torn down. Highway 101 northbound at Highway 92 overpass.
Highway 17 in Santa Cruz Mountains from Scotts Valley to Highway 9
for an estimated three weeks due to slides. Highway 25 from Highway
101 to 15 miles south of Hollister in San Benito County due to
slides.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WEATHER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Rain and temperatures as low as the 40s were forecast for the
area by Saturday. Authorities said that could hamper rescue efforts
and create additional dangers around damaged structures.
   Rain also heightened the threat of additional landslides in the
mountains north of Santa Cruz, where 60 homes already have been
destroyed in Boulder Creek, a town of 6,800.
