   Here is a look at the earthquake that jolted Northern California
on Tuesday.

<NOTE>THE QUAKE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The quake hit at 5:04 p.m. PDT and registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale. It was centered on the notorious San Andreas Fault, about
eight miles northeast of Santa Cruz and about 75 miles south of San
Francisco. It was the sixth-most powerful quake to strike
California this century and the most powerful since a 7.0 quake
centered in Eureka in 1980. The tremor was felt as far away as Los
Angeles, 400 miles to the south. At least four aftershocks of
lesser magnitude followed.

<NOTE>CASUALTIES:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 people were killed, making the quake the second
deadliest in the nation's history following the 1906 San Francisco
quake that killed more than 700.
   At least 200 people were crushed to death in their cars when a
mile-long section of the upper level of Interstate 880 in Oakland
collapsed onto the lower level. In San Francisco, five people were
killed when a building collapsed on cars and three others died in a
spectacular fire in the Marina district, apparently triggered by a
ruptured gas line. Six others died in the collapse of part of the
City Garden Mall in Santa Cruz, and one person died of a heart
attack San Jose.
   About 400 people were injured, mostly by falling or being hit by
debris.

<NOTE>DAMAGE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Highways, bridges and buildings collapsed, a few fires broke
out, plaster fell off buildings and ceilings and windows popped out
of high-rise buildings. Power was knocked out to as many as 1
million customers in the Bay area and telephone service was
disrupted.
   In addition to the collapse along Interstate 880 in Oakland, a
30-foot section of the upper level of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge collapsed onto the lower level, closing the span. The San
Mateo bridge, which crosses the bay about 10 miles south of
Candlestick Park, was closed for inspection. The Golden Gate
Bridge, which connects San Francisco to Marin County to the north,
remained open with no reports of damage. The Bay Area Rapid Transit
system was shut down, the Oakland Airport was closed and San
Francisco Airport was restricted to outgoing flights. Traffic was
snarled and thousands of commuters were stranded.
   A fire destroyed several buildings in the Marina section of San
Francisco and another fire damaged a section of downtown Berkeley.
   At least two bridges in the Santa Cruz area collapsed and other
highways leading out of the city suffered significant damage. In
nearby Hollister, a bridge on Highway 101 collapsed and a downtown
department store caved in.
   The Defense Department reported ``light to moderate damage'' at
the several military installations in the Bay area.

<NOTE>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In Washington, President Bush said the federal government was
prepared to send help. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and
Vice President Quayle were heading to the area to assess the
damage, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency dispatched
officials to Sacramento to help state workers handle aid paperwork.
Military officials mobilized two National Guard units to aid the
rescue. Gov. George Deukmejian cut short a trade mission to
Frankfurt, West Germany, and flew home on a U.S. Air Force plane.

<NOTE>WORLD SERIES:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake shook Candlestick Park about a half hour before
Game Three of the World Series was to begin, forcing the game's
cancellation and the evacuation of 60,000 fans. No major injuries
reported at the stadium.
