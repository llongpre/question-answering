   By smell and sound, dogs and technicians
searched Wednesday for the last possible survivors of the killer
Bay Quake, and Californians by the thousands picked their way
through glass-strewn streets in search of a semblance of normal
life.
   Across San Francisco Bay in Oakland, hopes faded for finding
anyone alive within the tons of steel and concrete left when
Tuesday's earthquake brought one level of Interstate 880 down atop
another.
   More than 250 people were feared entombed in that twisted
wreckage, and at least 18 others were dead elsewhere in the quake
area. Some 650 people were injured, said state emergency services
spokesman John Peterson.
   ``To the best of our knowledge now, there are not any people
still alive on this freeway,'' said Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson
said of the collapsed roadway.
   Searchers had been hindered by darkness and the condition of the
wrecked freeway, which Acting Oakland City Manager Craig Kocian
described as ``a house of cards'' that could collapse further at
any time unless rescuers work carefully.
   The 1\ miles of the Nimitz Freeway that collapsed was one of
oldest in the area, built in 1950s, and apparently was not included
in a program to make spans earthquake-proof, said state
Transportation Department spokesman Kyle Nelson.
   In just 15 seconds, the earthquake destroyed or damaged hundreds
of buildings along 100 miles of the San Andreas Fault, collapsed a
section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and two spans near
Santa Cruz, cracked roads, and severed gas and power lines,
sparking fires.
   The temblor, the nation's second-deadliest, surpassed only by
the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, measured 6.9 on the Richter
scale and was felt 350 miles away.
   Even as residents and officials tried to evaluate the damage,
President Bush signed a disaster declaration making federal funds
available for recovery, and said ``we will take every step and make
every effort'' to help.
   The president said he probably would fly to the area for a
personal inspection but left open when that might happen. Vice
President Dan Quayle and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
toured the quake-ravaged area by helicopter Wednesday.
   The federal government normally pays at least 75 percent of the
cost of rebuilding bridges and public facilities that are
destroyed, and provides low-cost loans. The order covered seven
counties.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency set up a center in
Washington and was trying to determine whether the relief order
should be expanded.
   Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy said damage was ``the better part of $1
billion.'' Other estimates were in the billions in San Francisco
alone.
   Gov. George Deukmejian headed home from a trade mission to West
Germany.
   In San Francisco's Marina District, where a fire fueled by gas
destroyed a block of 12 apartment buildings, about 500 people
packed a cafeteria at Marina Middle School for breakfast after
spending the night on cots and mats.
   Deputy Fire Chief Mike K. Farrell said he strongly suspected
people were trapped in collapsed buildings. ``We're going to bring
in dogs to see if people are trapped in there. I saw three- and
four-story buildings that are now one-story buildings.''
   Los Angeles donated sonic equipment to help detect any sounds of
people trapped alive in rubble, said Scott Shafer, a spokesman for
Mayor Art Agnos. Nine people are known dead and ``I expect we'll
find more bodies,'' he said.
   State Sen. Milton Marks of San Francisco estimated damage in the
Marina area alone at $1 billion. Shafer said damage throughout the
city would run into the billions.
   The transportation system was crippled by the closing of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and Agnos urged commuters to stay
home Wednesday.
   Tourist ferries that helped Tuesday by giving commuters free
rides to Oakland charged the normal $4 on Wednesday. The Oakland
and San Francisco International airports reopened and BART, the
rapid transit system, was open.
   Virginia Rose, one of about 400 people who spent the night at an
emergency Red Cross center, said, ``I have antiques, silver and
nice things. But when you really get down to it _ and I never
thought I'd feel this way _ these things don't matter. The material
things do not make life.''
   About 50 volunteers worked at the shelter and more walked in to
offer their services Wednesday morning. ``People have been
wonderful. We had an incredible community response,'' said Marian
Richie, a volunteer Red Cross nurse.
   Students from the University of San Francisco visited the
shelter Tuesday night to ask what was needed, went back to campus
and returned with food, cots and blankets, Richie said. ``It's an
absolute grass-roots response. I've never seen anything like it.
People come up and say, `How can I help?'''
   It looked like a Sunday afternoon in San Francisco's financial
district, with little visible damage, though many buildings were
closed. A sign on the International Building on California Street _
the equivalent of New York's Wall Street _ said, ``Building closed!
No power. No exceptions!''
   More than 1 million people lost electricity, including the
financial district office of Merrill Lynch, where operations
manager Joe Centis said he arrived at 5:30 a.m. and found wire room
operator Tom Begley using a power-safe phone to call in orders that
came in Tuesday after the New York market closed.
   Officials said power in San Francisco would be restored
Wednesday.
   In Oakland, people picked their way to work through broken glass
and broken buildings Wednesday. Employees of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, like others, waited outside their office while engineers
inspected it.
   ``If they let us in, we'll be lucky,'' said Judy Colwell, who
suffered a bone bruise on her arm during the quake. Water from a
broken main still dripped from light fixtures on a third floor
overhang of the building's facade.
   Ironworkers at a high-rise under construction near I-880 were on
standby to help untangle the wreckage of the highway. The
building's temporary floors were askew and the workers' elevator
had fallen and lay embedded in the pavement.
   ``We put it up, so we're going to have to go up and straighten
it up,'' Jim Osburn said of the building. ``It's always more
dangerous to take it down than it is to take it up, but somebody
will have to go up there and make it safe.''
   While some people arrived for work, others were finishing a long
night.
   ``I've been out here since 7 o'clock,'' said Randy Rogers, one
of three men shoveling fist-sized chunks of fallen masonry into a
pickup truck.
   Red Cross volunteers began house-hunting for evacuees who spent
the night in cafeterias and gymnasiums. ``Hopefully we'll have them
all out in a couple of days,'' said Tekoa King, a Red Cross nurse.
