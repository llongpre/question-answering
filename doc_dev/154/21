   A strong earthquake shook the San
Francisco Peninsula on Monday, but there were no immediate reports
of injury or serious damage.
   ``I went outside and watched the windows rattle,'' said Marcey
Beaupre, manager of the Super Yarn Mart in nearby Santa Clara. ``I
got 20 windows and all they did was rattle. Nothing happened.''
   The U.S. Geological Survey set a preliminary magnitude of 5.0 on
the Richter scale for the temblor, while the University of
California's seismographic stations at Berkeley rated it at 4.4.
   A 5.0 quake is considered powerful enough to cause considerable
damage in populated areas.
   Witnesses reported a rolling quake lasting 15 to 20 seconds. It
was felt in most of the San Francisco Bay area, including as far
north at Petaluma and in the region south and east of San Jose.
   USGS spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson said the quake struck at 10:46
a.m. on the Calaveras Fault and was centered eight miles east of
Milpitas, about 50 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   ``We don't have any reports of major damage,'' said Vince
Montane, regional manager of the state Office of Emergency
Services. ``The cities and counties have called in with a few
instances of broken glass and plates falling off shelves and
pictures off the walls and that kind of thing.''
   A 100-square-foot pane of glass shattered in the control tower
at Reid-Hillview Airport, showering glass into the parking lot
three stories below. No injuries were reported.
   There were reports of telephone outages, but Pacific Bell
officials blamed it on overloaded circuits.
   April 18 is the anniversary of the great San Francisco
earthquake of 1906, which triggered fires which destroyed most of
the city.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of
6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in Alaska
hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.
