   San Francisco Bay area residents were
jolted awake Tuesday by a sharp earthquake that broke windows,
toppled groceries and startled a man into falling to his death from
a fifth-story apartment window.
   The quake occurred as state and federal emergency services
officials prepared to conduct a two-day test of their response to a
catastrophic earthquake.
   The quake, which hit with a jolt and rolled for 10 seconds,
caused only minor structural damage, but was felt as far away as
San Luis Obispo, about 230 miles south of San Francisco and in
Sonoma County, 60 miles to the north.
   The temblor struck at 1:13 a.m. and measured 5.2 on the Richter
scale of ground motion. It was centered on the San Andreas fault
about 15 miles south of San Jose.
   A moderate aftershock measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale struck
at 1:44 a.m., followed by a second, stronger aftershock that
measured 4.5 at 8:53 a.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey
in Menlo Park.
   ``I thought all my windows were going to break,'' said Margaret
Dunlap of San Francisco. ``My whole bed was shaking.''
   In Los Gatos, where the quake was centered, police reported that
Matthew James Bignall, 19, accidentally jumped from his bedroom
window after apparently being startled awake by the earthquake.
   Bignall died of multiple injuries, according to a spokeswoman
with the Santa Clara County coroner's office.
   Residents reported some broken windows and items falling off
shelves but no major problems, a Los Gatos police dispatcher said.
Damage was confined mostly to Santa Clara and northern Santa Cruz
counties, according to the state Office of Emergency Services in
Sacramento.
   Experts warned that the seismic activity signals an increased
chance that a severe earthquake will strike the area during the
next week.
   ``It certainly shows us the fault is becoming more active,''
said Andy Michael, a USGS geophysicist, who said the quake was the
largest in the area since 1969.
   ``The stress is building up in the earth and we're going to
start getting large earthquakes,'' said Michael. ``It should serve
as a reminder to prepare.''
   Dave Shea, 21, spent more than an hour cleaning up the paint
store he manages in Los Gatos, where about 20 cans fell off shelves
and four quarts of paint splattered on the floor.
   ``It made a nice little splotch mess,'' he said, estimating
damage at about $300.
   The false ceiling in a vacant Los Gatos business came down, and
about half a dozen businesses reported broken windows, police said.
One of the front windows of a grocery store blew out, according
Sharon Sieker, an assistant manager at the Safeway. She said she
found ``red wine all over the floor'' when she arrived about 2 a.m.
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Pacific Bell reported no major
problems as a result of the quake.
   The earthquake drill involved a mock temblor in the Bay area in
which 5,000 people die.
   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, was in
Sacramento to attend the first day of the test. When she woke up at
5:30 a.m. and saw coverage of the actual earthquake on television,
she thought it was part of the exercise.
   ``I thought, `Gee, this is pretty interesting. They have the
(earthquake) simulation on television already,''' Mrs. Quayle said.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   San Francisco's Great Quake, which occurred in 1906 before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3. Recent
estimates say more than 2,000 people died in the quake and the fire
it touched off, which burned much of the city.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of
6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in Alaska
hit 8.5 on the Richter scale, killing 114 people.
