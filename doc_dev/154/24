   Like storm-tossed captains plotting a
course around rocks and shoals, a million San Francisco Bay area
workers _ their normal commute routes ruined by an earthquake _ are
devising new strategies for getting to and from work.
   ``I really don't see how there cannot be gridlock on Monday,''
said a harried Tom Silvey, a state Franchise Tax Board worker now
assigned to the state Office of Emergency Services.
   Monday is considered the region's transportation equivalent of
D-day along 70 miles from San Francisco to Santa Cruz. It includes
a plan for using Navy landing craft to ferry commuters between
Oakland and San Francisco, where four freeways and high-speed
connectors are closed.
   For much of the work force, commute times are expected to
stretch into an extra hour or more each way.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit, the railroad that travels under San
Francisco Bay to connect the city with East Bay communities, is
running extra cars and expanding to 24-hour operation. Daily BART
business is expected to double to at least 300,000 person-trips.
   Morning comute tolls have been eliminated on all transbay
bridges except the Golden Gate, where commuters will be excused
from tolls on Friday mornings only.
   By far the most serious disruption is to the traffic _ 243,000
vehicles each working day _ normally carried by the key
eight-mile-long San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. It a major San
Francisco lifeline for food, industrial and other goods, vehicular
traffic from the east, and some half-million people a day.
   Tuesday's quake dumped a 50-foot section of the bridge's top
deck onto the bottom deck of the 52-year-old span, and engineers
estimated repairs might take as long as two months.
   A driver who normally takes the Bay Bridge from San Francisco to
Oakland must now either go 20 miles south and then cross the bay on
the San Mateo Bridge, or take the Golden Gate Bridge and drive 18
miles north in Marin County to cross the bay on the Richmond-San
Rafael Bridge. The southern route costs an extra 60 miles, the
northern detour an additional 40 miles.
   In Oakland, the upper deck of a 1\-mile portion of Interstate
880 collapsed onto the lower deck in a deadly vise of concrete and
steel. The roadway, a conduit to and from the Bay Bridge, East
Oakland, bay-side cities and points south, will be out of
commission for at least two years.
   In Santa Cruz, 70 miles south of San Francisco, the 20,000
people who cross the Santa Cruz Mountains daily on State Highway 17
to work in Silicon Valley must seek alternate routes because
landslides have closed that route.
   The recommended alternates from San Jose to Santa Cruz: South on
101 to Highway 152 west, then north to Highway 1 _ 40 miles extra;
or, west from San Jose on Highway 9 _ 20 miles extra.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. announced Friday it had suspended bus
service to Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Los Gatos, Cupertino and
Saratoga because of the closure of Highway 17.
   In San Francisco, central-city motorists used to zipping down
the hills to the Gough and Oak street connectors to Highway 101
found the on-ramps closed because of structural damage to roadway
underpinnings. They must now travel city streets for a mile or so
to find southbound on-ramps.
   In addition, the city's Embarcadero Freeway, which runs on the
edge of the bay, is closed because of structural failure. And the
I-280 extension from downtown San Francisco to 101 near Candlestick
Park sustained structural failure and will be closed for several
months.
   Those are the only two other double-deck freeways in Northern
California besides I-880.
