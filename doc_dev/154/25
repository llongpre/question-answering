   A slightly increased risk of a severe
earthquake exists in an area south of San Francisco that was jolted
by a moderate temblor this week, say state officials who also
caution against public alarm.
   California's Office of Emergency Services issued an advisory
Tuesday saying that for the next five days, the slightly increased
likelihood for continued seismic activity was possible for the
region rocked by Monday's earthquake, which scientists estimated at
between 5.0 and 5.7 on the Richter scale.
   Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, University of
California, Berkeley, and the state Division of Mines and Geology
``say that this activity could involve an earthquake as large as
6.5 Richter magnitude, although it's not probable that a quake of
this size will occur,'' the advisory said.
   It was issued to alert officials of Santa Cruz, San Benito,
Monterey and Santa Clara counties ``to maintain preparedness and
awareness measures.''
   The chance of a magnitude-6.5 quake on the San Andreas Fault
within five days ``is a very slight possibility, but we do feel it
is our responsibility to make this information public,'' Office of
Emergency Services spokesman Tom Mullins said from Sacramento.
   ``There is some some concern, although no alarm,'' said Mike
Guerin, a spokesman at the agency's office in Ontario.
   Damage from a 6.5-magnitude quake could be comparable to that
caused by the 6.2-magnitude Morgan Hill quake on April 24, 1984,
acting state geologist Brian Tucker said. That quake injured 27
people and caused $10 million in damage.
   Residents of San Jose and the San Francisco Bay area could
expect a 6.5-magnitude quake to cause ``swaying of high-rise
buildings, potentially some fires and some localized areas of more
intense damage'' to buildings, Tucker said.
   Guerin said the advisory, which isn't a prediction, was issued
because scientists believe additional stress has been placed on a
portion of the San Andreas Fault by Monday's quake, which swayed
skyscrapers in San Francisco but resulted in no reports of injuries
or serious damage.
   Monday's quake was centered on the San Andreas Fault 16 miles
south of San Jose, officials said.
   Tucker said scientists believe Monday's quake added stress to
the San Andreas in part because the section of the fault that
snapped had been relatively quiet for years and the temblor
occurred near the junction of the San Andreas and Sargent faults.
Quakes are more likely to start near fault junctions, he said.
   Quake predictions or advisories have been rare in the United
States.
   In April 1985, the USGS predicted that by Janauary 1993, an
earthquake measuring about 6 on the Richter scale is highly likely
to hit the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas, a sparsely
populated section about 130 miles southeast of the section that
ruptured Monday. The prediction remains in effect.
   In June 1985, a series of magnitude 2.5 to 4.2 quakes near San
Diego spurred the USGS to advise there was a 5 percent chance of a
magnitude 5.0 quake within five days. None occurred.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.
