   There is a sense of triumph amid the death
and destruction of the earthquake that struck California.
   Skyscrapers shook but didn't fall. Trains stopped but most were
running again within hours. Businesses closed for a day to assess
damage, then reopened. The Bay Bridge was crippled, so thousands of
commuters switched to ferries.
   Police and fire officials maintained order. Hospitals stayed
open with auxiliary power. Radio and television kept up a critical
flow of information to the public.
   Perhaps most important, though, the vast majority of people
didn't panic. Instead, they comforted and helped each other, taking
in neighbors and strangers.
   The quake created heroes, from a surgeon who rescued a child
trapped on the collapsed Interstate 880 freeway to the thousands
who worked round the clock coping with the crisis.
   ``If this was a test of the San Francisco Bay area's ability to
respond to a major earthquake, we got an `A,''' says Steven Levy,
director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the
California Economy.
   ``There are more than 6 million people in the Bay area and a
couple of hundred people died,'' Levy said Thursday, two days after
the quake. ``It's horrible for the families of victims and
traumatic for everyone, but it's not in the realm of a regional
economic disaster.''
   Certainly, there were failures and lessons to be learned.
   Commuters trapped in a Bay Area Rapid Transit train beneath the
bay when power went out complained they weren't given enough
information by BART officials about the quake.
   The San Francisco Fire Department said it was understaffed and
stretched to the limit in fighting blazes. Mayor Art Agnos said he
was ``ticked off'' that Vice President Dan Quayle failed to consult
with him during a tour of city.
   And questions continue about why I-880 crumbled and why a
section of the Bay Bridge fell like a trap door.
   Seen from a helicopter, though, San Francisco and Oakland remain
remarkably intact. The towers of steel, concrete and glass in both
cities stand tall in defiance of a jolt that sent shock waves 750
miles up and down the coast and eastward through the Central Valley
and Sierra Nevada.
   ``It speaks a lot for the design code of modern buildings and
the preparedness of California that there wasn't more damage,''
said George Lee, acting director of the National Center for
Earthquake Engineering Research at the State University of New York
at Buffalo.
   The skyscrapers were unharmed, Lee said, because they were
``overdesigned'' to prevent sway in upper levels and to resist
powerful wind gusts as much as earthquakes.
   ``I think we're going to learn a lot from this event,'' Lee
said. ``Many of the buildings have instruments that can determine
stresses and strains. We know the original designs of these
buildings and we know the ground motion and amplitude. Adding these
together will give us a very good picture where the weak links are
and that will improve designs for the future.''
   Most small buildings and homes throughout the Bay area also
survived with little or no damage, unlike those that crumbled in
Soviet Armenia when a similar 6.9 magnitude quake struck last
December and left 25,000 people dead and tens of thousands homeless.
   The economic toll of the California quake is already estimated
at $4 billion and, according to Frank McCormick, a top economist
for the Bank of America in San Francisco, is likely to reach $10
billion. But that represents only about a month's worth of the Bay
area's $125 billion annual economy, he said, and will be offset
quickly by a boost to the economy from reconstruction jobs,
insurance payments and federal assistance.
   Within a day of the quake, trucks were moving in and out of the
Port of Oakland, which handles 1,700 vessels a month.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco continued to process
cash, checks and wire transfers ``without a glitch,'' according to
a spokesman. Most large banks used emergency generators to keep
their computers operating.
   San Francisco and Oakland international airports resumed
operations Wednesday. San Jose's was shut down for only three hours
Tuesday night.
   The ultimate triumphs, though, were personal. Len Jann, a
station agent for BART, worked 18 hours day from Tuesday afternoon
until Wednesday morning to help people.
   ``We worked the whole night just to make sure people could get
back across the bay, and we stayed with them to make them feel they
weren't alone in this,'' he said.
   Among those he aided were three women _ one black, one white,
one Asian _ who were stuck in San Francisco. Jann and his
co-workers watched over the women as they huddled together in the
BART station until 1 a.m., then drove them to the ferry and
arranged to have their husbands meet them in Oakland.
   ``Race, origin, what they did for a living, nothing mattered,''
he said. ``These three ladies banded together. That was typical of
how everybody acted. The whole Bay area banded together and
survived.''
