   Three strong aftershocks rattled a jittery
Northern California on Thursday, and rescuers who found fewer cars
than feared under a collapsed freeway said the World Series may
have reduced the rush-hour traffic.
   ``Maybe we got lucky because of the game,'' Oakland police Sgt.
Bob Crawford said. ``Normally at 5 o'clock in the afternoon this
area would be bumper-to-bumper. Maybe the World Series saved our
lives.'
   Power and commuters returned to much of downtown San Francisco
as a tentative city tried to recover and regroup following
Tuesday's earthquake, which claimed scores of lives and at least
$2.87 billion in damage.
   Residents of the ravaged Marina district, furious at initially
being barred from their homes, later lined up for 15-minute passes
to fetch clothing, medicine, food and belongings.
   At the 1\-mile stretch of the collapsed double-deck Interstate
880, the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, workers cut holes in concrete
and used cranes to pull out pancake-flat cars. Rescuers reported
finding the cars as far apart as 60 feet, rather than
bumper-to-bumper as had been feared, Assistant Fire Chief Al
Sigwart said.
   That could lower the death toll in the highway rubble _
estimated earlier at 253, authorities said.
   ``They are going lower, much lower in fact,'' Lisa Covington, a
spokeswoman for the Office of Emergency Services, said of the
estimates. ``What's happening is that they are finding fewer
vehicles under the bridge than they thought.''
   Firefighter Dan Getreu said he had walked the length of the
fallen highway and estimated no more than two dozen cars were
trapped.
   No new official estimate of fatalities was made.
   Many people left work early to watch the third game of the World
Series, scheduled to start at 5:30 p.m., and 60,000 people already
were across the bay in San Francisco at Candlestick Park when the
quake struck at 5:04 p.m.
   The World Series will resume Tuesday at Candlestick Park in San
Francisco.
   Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said Thursday that only 85 people
were officially reported missing.
   On Thursday morning, three aftershocks struck south of San
Francisco. The first, measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, hit at 3:15 a.m. and was centered near Watsonville, about
eight miles from the epicenter of Tuesday's 6.9 quake, according to
the state Office of Emergency Services. Two other aftershocks
measured 4.5.
   ``No one is really sleeping around here,'' Watsonville resident
John Murphy said.
   ``I can't stop shaking,'' said 73-year-old Marcelina Toussaint.
``I guess I'm surviving, but I'm scared.''
   Fifty-six people were treated at a Watsonville community clinic,
mostly for bruises and frazzled nerves, city spokeswoman Lorraine
Washington said. About 150 people were evacuated from a National
Guard Armory shelter after a natural gas leak.
   Watsonville issued a plea for additional doctors and nurses.
   Some homes that were damaged in the initial quake collapsed
under the power of the aftershocks. Many residents of the town of
30,000, part of California's ``salad bowl'' region where much of
the nation's lettuce, asparagus and artichokes are grown, spread
across lawns and vacant lots like refugees.
   ``We're talking about people with no resources, no money for
food and no money for health care,'' said Barbara Garcia, executive
director of Salud Pera La Gente, a state-financed community clinic.
   As of early Thursday, more than 1,400 aftershocks had been
recorded. The strongest, 5.2 on the Richter scale, struck within 40
minutes of the initial jolt, according the U.S. Geological Survey.
   Across the Bay area, the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan
area with more than 6 million people, shaken cities tried to cope
as best they could with still-limited services, strapped police and
fire departments and transportation havoc created by the closing of
freeways and the Bay Bridge, the lifeline that links Oakland and
San Francisco.
   A transportation department spokesman said a large marine barge
crane was being moved into place to lift the fallen upper deck slab
of the bridge, which might be reopened in three weeks.
   Frustration and despair were evident on city streets.
   Dan Lai sat on a curb in the ravaged Marina district with his
head in his hands, crying.
