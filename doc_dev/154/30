<LEADPARA>  East Bay commuters awoke this morning to a logistical nightmare: Sunday's fire
had closed two of the primary links connecting Contra Costa and northern
Alameda counties with Oakland and San Francisco.;   With authorities unsure of
when those routes would reopen, traffic officials were advising commuters to
add anywhere from 90 minutes to three hours to get to work today, and the
California Highway Patrol continued to urge commuters to avoid state highways
24 and 13, as well as Interstate 580 between those two routes.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For this afternoon, the commuting picture is clouded. BART is a key factor
in the traffic pattern, and officials had not decided early this morning which
East Bay routes would be open.;   Three major problems faced commuters this
morning:;   (check) The Caldecott Tunnel on state Highway 24, where on a
normal weekday more than 40,000 cars travel from Walnut Creek to Interstate
580 in Oakland, remained closed after fire burned all around the tunnel
Sunday.;   (check) A six-mile stretch of Highway 13, connecting Highway 24
with Interstate 580 in Oakland, also was closed, and officials could not
predict when it would reopen.;   (check) And BART trains from Concord into
Oakland and San Francisco were shut down between the Rockridge and Orinda
stations because of fire in and around BART's Berkeley Hills tunnel.;   About
70,000 commuters ride this BART line on a typical Monday, and Bay Area Rapid
Transit officials scrambled to meet today's demand with additional bus
service, said spokesman Sy Mouber.;   Authorities were advising visitors to
avoid San Francisco and Oakland today and encouraged motorists to use these
alternatives:;   (check) Bay Bridge commuters traveling from the north could
use Interstate 80 and then take the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge to Marin. That
connects with Highway 101 and the Golden Gate Bridge into San Francisco.;  
(check) If coming from the east, motorists could use interstates 238 and 880
to the San Mateo and Dumbarton bridges.;   The fire was so big and so out of
control that harried officials had few words of comfort for commuters other
than the standard advice about carpooling and avoiding unnecessary trips.;  
"Everything is just contingent on the parameters of the fire," said a CHP
spokeswoman, Sgt. Pat Tracy.;   "It depends on the wind," she added.  </TEXT>
