<TEXT>     Passengers and crew were evacuated on emergency slides. Some passengers
suffered minor scrapes and burns from the vinyl evacuation slides, said San
Francisco International Airport duty officer Bob Schneider.;    A light
indicating a fire in the No. 2 rear engine went on when the DC-10 was about
two hours from San Francisco, Schneider said.;    The pilot decided to land
after he "fired bottles in the air that are used to put out any fires that
might be, and the light stayed on," Hurd said.;    Ground maintenance crews
found no sign of fire on the aircraft, Hurd said.  </TEXT>
