   SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 _ Earthquakes and fire today have put
nearly half of San Francisco in ruins.
   At least 200 persons have been killed, thousands injured, and
the property loss will exceed $100,000,000.
   Thousands are homeless and destitute and all day long streams of
people have been fleeing from the stricken districts to places of
safety. ...
   Most of the principal buildings have already been destroyed and
others are in imminent danger. Over all the scene of desolation
hangs a dense pall of smoke. ...
   It was 5:13 this morning when a terrific earthquake shock shook
the whole city and surrounding country.
   One shock apparently lasted two minutes and there was almost
immediate collapse of flimsy structures all over the city. ...
   The people became panic-stricken and rushed into the streets,
most of them in their night attire. They were met by showers of
falling buildings, bricks, cornices, and walls. Many were instantly
crushed to death, while others were dreadfully mangled. ...
   Fires have been raging all day, and the fire department has been
powerless to do anything except dynamite buildings threatened. All
day long explosions have shaken the city and added to the terror of
the inhabitants. ...
   All efforts to stay the progress of the fire were futile. The
south side of Market Street from Ninth street to the bay was soon
ablaze, the fire covering a belt two blocks wide. ...
   At the same time the commercial establishments and banks north
of Market street were burning. The burning district in this section
of the city extended from Sansome street to the water front, and
the entire city seemed to be in flames. ...
   The greatest destruction occurred in that part of the city which
was reclaimed from San Francisco bay. Much of the devasted district
was at one time low marshy ground covered by water at high tide. ...
   The damage by the earthquake to the residence portion of the
city, the finest part of which is on Nob Hill and Pacific Heights,
seems to have been slight. ...
   The magnificent Fairmount Hotel, not yet completed, stands on
the brink of Nob Hill, overlooking the bay. The hotel was not
seriously damaged. ...
   Telegraph and telephone communication was shut off for a time.
   The Western Union was put completely out of business and the
Postal company was the only company that managed to get a wire out
of the city. About 10 o'clock even the Postal was forced to
suspend. ...
   Deep fissures opened in the filled-in ground near the shore and
the Union Ferry depot was injured. ...
   The Valencia Hotel, a four-story wooden building, sank into the
basement, a pile of splintered timbers, under which were pinned
many dead and dying occupants of the house. The basement was full
of water and some of the helpless victims were drowned. ...
   At 9 o'clock this morning 1,000 men from the Presido arrived
down town to patrol the city streets. ...The soldiers have been
ordered to shoot down thieves caught in the act of robbng the dead,
and to guard with their lives the millions of dollars worth of
property which has been placed in the streets, that it may escape
the ravages of the flames.
