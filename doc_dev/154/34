   Fans stood for a moment of silence, then
let out a whooping cheer Friday as the World Series resumed 10 days
after a devastating earthquake.
   Rescue workers threw out the first ball and the crowd joined in
singing the 1936 song ``San Francisco'' in opening ceremonies that
began with a moment of silence for those killed and injured in the
quake.
   ``We've had enough time for mourning. Now it's time to celebrate
life,'' said Jean Alvers, 62, who wore a yellow hard hat. ``This
series needs to be played. If they canceled it it would have been a
lot harder to do other things.''
   ``It was OK to be excited,'' said Donna Verhorst of Oakland.
   The Oakland Athletics defeated the San Francisco Giants 13-7,
giving the Athletics a 3-0 advantage in the best of seven series.
   The first cheer went up when the scoreboard lit up with,
``Welcome Back to Game 3'' _ and the stadium shook again, not from
the quake but the roar of the fans.
   Some less fortunate fans watched the game from Red Cross
shelters where televisions were set up for the thousands of people
left homeless.
   ``It takes your mind off the earthquake, and that's good for the
nerves,'' said Winston Presley, 54, as he sat with a cluster of A's
fans in the gymnasium of Oakland's Lowell Middle School.
   For many, the resumption of the Bay Bridge World Series, its
symbol now fractured by the quake, was a kind of therapy in the
wake of the deadly tremor.
   ``Time heals all wounds,'' said Ray Torres, another fan. He and
a friend, Alphonso Castaneda, had seats two rows from the top of
the stadium, and Castaneda had made a banner that read, ``Upper
deck parachute rental.''
   As fans filed in, the public address system periodically said,
``In the event of an aftershock, don't panic ...''
   ``I think it's my attempt to conquer my own fears,'' said Steven
Walch of his decision to attend the game. Having seen Candlestick
shudder and crack, he added, ``I want to be at the World Series,
and I don't think it's more unsafe ... than any other place. And I
want to get back to my normal life.''
   The organizers of the game tried to help. Throwing out the first
balls were 12 representatives of Bay area agencies who assisted in
relief efforts.
   They included workers from the San Francisco Fire Department,
Highland General Hospital in Oakland, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San
Francisco Police Department, California Department of
Transportation, the California Conservation Corps, the Oakland Fire
Department, the Santa Cruz County Red Cross, Santa Cruz County
Salvation Army, Pacific Bell, San Francisco Sheriff's Department,
and the California Highway Patrol.
   ``We've realized we need all this. Baseball can be part of this
area's mental therapy,'' said Giants manager Roger Craig.
   ``Baseball is the most resilient of all American institutions,''
said Commissioner Fay Vincent, who announced a $1.4 million gift
from baseball to earthquake relief.
   Mail Vincent received from around the country after the quake
urged that the series be called off, he said Friday, adding that he
understood the feelings. ``But I don't think there is any
disrespect in going on with the World Series,'' he said.
   Dave Stewart, starting pitcher for the Oakland Athletics, said
the players have had difficulty preparing for the game.
   ``We've all been through a national tragedy. I'm sure I'm not
alone, but the earthquake had a deep psychological effect on me,''
Stewart said.
   San Francisco Giants outfielder Brett Butler said the game gave
62,000 fans ``a chance to let out all that frustration and hurt and
trauma. This is America's game. It's going to bring all of us in
this area back together again.''
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos agreed. ``We all need a respite,''
he said. ``We can enjoy the World Series and still remember those
we lost and those who are still affected by this tragedy.''
   Six people remained unaccounted for, authorities said, and the
death toll rose Friday to 64, including an 88-year-old San Mateo
woman who was pronounced dead of a heart attack shortly after the
quake but who had not previously been listed among the dead.
   Thirty-nine of those killed were in the collapse of
double-decked Interstate 880 in Oakland. As demolition there
continued, the search for more bodies was delayed because the road
was too shaky.
   In other quake developments:
   _ Dockworker Buck Helm, rescued after four days in the rubble of
I-880, remained in serious condition in Oakland's Highland General
Hospital. He was said to be conscious most of the time.
   _ Julio Berumen, the 6-year-old whose leg was amputated during
rescue from the I-880 rubble, was listed in good condition and
improving at Children's Hospital in Oakland. His sister Cathy, 8,
was in serious but stable condition following surgery Wednesday.
They lost their mother in the freeway collapse. About $48,000 has
been donated to a fund for them.
   _ On Friday, 150 relatives and friends gathered at an El Cerrito
cemetery for the funeral of a woman killed on the collapsing
portion of the Bay Bridge. Anamafi Filoli Moala was buried in a
ceremony typical of the Pacific island of Tonga, with dirges and
many of those present wearing palm grass skirts.
   _ In Santa Cruz on Friday, a wrecker's ball crashed into the
imposing Cooper House, a downtown landmark and centerpiece of the
heavily damaged Pacific Garden Mall. Some who watched the
demolition, which began Thursday, dabbed at tears. For 94 years the
huge brick building was a gathering point for the seaside tourist
town.
   ``We will come back, better than it was,'' said 86-year-old Bill
Davidson.
   _ Lawyer Melvin Belli on Friday filed $22 million worth of
claims against the state on behalf of 10 victims of the collapse of
I-880. If the claims _ $3 million for each of two wrongful deaths
and $2 million for each of eight injured survivors _ are rejected
by the state, civil lawsuits would be filed, Belli said.
   _ A convention of traumatic stress experts that coincidentally
came to San Francisco a few days after the earthquake held a
seminar on the disaster Friday, with experts saying everyone in the
area needed to talk about the experience and to use jokes to
relieve stress.
   ``The use of humor is good,'' said Dr. Tom Williams of Aurora,
Colo., of the Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. ``There's so
much irony.'' People in the area have swung through a gamut of
emotions including shock, excitement and euphoria at being alive,
he said.
