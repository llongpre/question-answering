<LEADPARA>  East Bay commuters will awake this morning to a logistical nightmare: Sunday's
fire closed two of the primary links connecting Contra Costa and northern
Alameda counties with Oakland and San Francisco.;   And authorities were
unsure when those routes would reopen. Late Sunday night, the California
Highway Patrol urged commuters to avoid state highways 24 and 13, as well as
Interstate 580 between those two routes.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Instead, motorists were encouraged to use these alternatives:;   (check)
Bay Bridge commuters traveling from the north could use Interstate 80 and then
take the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge to Marin. That connects with Highway 101
and the Golden Gate Bridge into San Francisco.;   (check) If coming from the
east, motorists could use interstates 238 and 880 to the San Mateo and
Dumbarton bridges.;   On a normal weekday, more than 40,000 cars travel
through the Caldecott Tunnel on state Highway 24, which runs from Walnut Creek
to Interstate 580 in Oakland. That route was closed Sunday because of flames
burning all around the tunnel, and officials were not expecting it to be open
today.;   The fire also forced officials to close a six-mile stretch of
Highway 13, connecting Highway 24 with Interstate 580 in Oakland. Officials
could not predict if it would reopen.;   About 70,000 commuters ride the BART
train from Concord into Oakland and San Francisco on a typical Monday, but
that line was closed Sunday between the Rockridge and Orinda stations because
of fire in and around BART's Berkeley Hills tunnel.;   BART will try to
arrange bus service to accommodate its riders, said spokesman Sy Mouber. He
advised commuters to call (510) 464-4282 after 6 a.m. or listen to their
radios for the latest information.;   The fire was so big and so out of
control that harried officials had few words of comfort for commuters, other
than the standard advice about carpooling and avoiding unnecessary trips.;  
"Everything is just contingent on the parameters of the fire," said a CHP
spokeswoman, Sgt. Pat Tracy.;   "It depends on the wind," she added.  </TEXT>
