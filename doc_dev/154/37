   A burned-out cabin light on a United
Airlines 727 emitted smoke shortly after takeoff today, forcing the
plane carrying 115 passengers to return to San Francisco airport,
airline officials reported.
   ``There was no fire, just smoke,'' said United spokesman Joe
Hopkins from the airline's Chicago headquarters. Earlier reports
from airport tower officials had said there was a fire on board.
   Hopkins said the smoke stopped when the plane's captain turned
off the electricity in the area of the light.
   ``The passenger reaction was quite good,'' said Hopkins. ``In
fact, one passenger joked and said he thought this was a no-smoking
flight.''
   The plane had just taken off for Los Angeles when the emergency
happened. It turned around near San Jose, a few minutes out of San
Francisco, and landed back in San Francisco about 9 a.m. and taxied
to the gate, where passengers were let off, said tower spokesman Joe
Pitts.
   The incident was under investigation by emergency personnel and
the Federal Aviation Administration, airport administration
officials reported.
