   Physical and emotional scars persist six
months after the killer earthquake jolted the San Francisco Bay
area, but most businesses and residents are back on solid ground.
   Economic activity has nearly regained its pre-quake level,
analysts say, and estimates of the cost of damage caused by the
massive temblor have been scaled back.
   The damage is widespread, nevertheless. The elevated section of
Interstate 880 in Oakland, where 42 people died when the road
collapsed Oct. 17, has been dismantled while discussions continue
about whether to rebuild or reroute it.
   The similarly elevated Embarcadero Freeway stands forlorn near
downtown San Francisco while politicians and business people debate
whether it should be replaced or rebuilt.
   Two sections of busy Highway 101 in San Francisco are under
repair, intensifying rush-hour traffic jams, and some small
businesses in hard-hit Oakland, Los Gatos, Santa Cruz and
Watsonville are still awaiting federal loans for reconstruction and
inventory replacement.
   In downtown Oakland, where many empty buildings are surrounded
by chain-link fences, the Emporium department store isn't expected
to reopen until August. The store suffered more than $10 million in
damage when display windows shattered, stairwells collapsed and the
exterior brick facade cracked.
   Small tremors, shrugged off or barely noticed by the Bay area's
six million residents before the 7.1 magnitude quake last fall, now
trigger memories of the tragedy that claimed 68 lives and worries
about the really big one that geologists say is bound to come.
   But the region's economy, on the whole, has rebounded vigorously
with no evidence of long-term damage.
   From the computer and chip companies in Silicon Valley to the
retail and financial giants in San Francisco, the Bay area remains
one of the most vibrant centers of economic activity in the country.
   Retail business in San Francisco is now about 96 percent of
normal, said Deputy Mayor James Ho. That's despite the fact that
some hard-hit sections _ Chinatown, North Beach, South of Market,
Fisherman's Wharf and the Mission _ continue to suffer. Business in
those areas is down from 8 to 18 percent, Ho said.
   An economic index based on measures of activity in real estate,
retailing, services, international trade, manufacturing and tourism
for the nine Bay area counties shows the region's economy virtually
recovered from the quake by December after a small dip in October
and November.
   The index compiled by Tapan Munroe, an economist with Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric Co. in San Francisco, and Walter E. Hoadley, a
Hoover Institution senior fellow, showed the overall strength of a
diversified economy that had long planned on ways to cope with a
big quake.
   ``The preparedness paid off,'' Munroe said. ``The region fared
very well in terms of emergency services.''
   Early estimates of $7 billion to $10 billion in damage have been
scaled down, but Munroe said the current figure of $5.6 billion
from state officials is still too high.
   Hotel and restaurant owners said their businesses still suffer,
though hotel occupancy rates in San Francisco are close to normal
even after the post-quake opening of two new large hotels, said
Steve Reiser of the accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster.
   Passenger arrivals at San Francisco International Airport were
off 11.8 percent in October and 4 percent in November from the same
months in 1988. But arrivals were up 0.7 percent in December.
   Fewer travelers from within the United States are coming to San
Francisco this year because of higher domestic air fares, but
international arrivals are booming, said airport spokesman Ron
Wilson.
   Ray Brady, research director for the Association of Bay Area
Governments in Oakland, said the region pulled through the quake so
easily because the economy is decentralized. When the Bay Bridge
collapse cut traffic in San Francisco, he noted, retail sales went
up in the East Bay _ so total retail sales in the region remained
constant.
   Traffic began rolling over the repaired Bay Bridge a month after
its partial collapse, and workers are continuing to repair the two
closed sections of Highway 101.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos wants to replace the Embarcadero
Freeway, long considered an eyesore, with an underground
expressway. The city's Board of Supervisors approved the plan
Monday night despite a three-hour strike by Chinatown merchants,
who claim that repairing the existing roadway would be cheaper and
get business traffic back into the depressed area more quickly.
