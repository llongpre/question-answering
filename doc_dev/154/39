   Thousands of stranded office workers
mingled with homeless people in downtown streets as a pitch black
night fell over the blacked out, earthquake-damaged city.
   Fire engines and ambulances, sirens howling, picked their way
through profound darkness as the sky turned indigo and a few stars
peeked through a layer of smoke from a fire in the northern Marina
district early today.
   The occasional office building or hotel running on emergency
generators stood out in the blackness. Electrically powered
trolleys formed little empty holes of light where they stalled,
emergency blinkers winking in and out.
   Car headlights criss-crossed and pedestrians dodged among them.
   Elderly residents of the Fox Plaza office building's penthouses
sat in complete darkness in the mezzanine, listening to the radio.
   ``We're in charge. It's under control. The citizens have
responded nobly,'' said Mayor Art Agnos. ``I think we were very
organized and we were very lucky. We were well prepared.''
   Thousands of downtown office workers were left with no major
transportation routes to homes across the water in areas of the
East Bay.
   Part of the top deck of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
collapsed onto the lower road. The BART commuter train was shut
down.
   After a two-hour bus ride bypassing the closed bridges over the
bay, writer Michael Mercer arrived at his Oakland home with ``just
enough moonlight to see that my apartment has been trashed by the
quake.
   ``I was going to rearrange things anyway,'' he said.
   Others stayed in San Francisco, strolling around, helping to
direct traffic or meeting friends in bars. Little looting or
vandalism was reported. People sat outside dingy hotels, on the
stoops of apartment houses, on curbs.
   An eerie, pale orange moon rose over the city.
   Among the buildings that remained lit were San Francisco General
Hospital and the elegant new Davies Symphony Hall, a glass and
brass structure with bright, full-length windows.
   The Marina district, where a huge fire consumed a block of
buildings, was without power. Emergency vehicles covered a
10-square-block area. Streets buckled everywhere and the smell of
natural gas permeated the air.
   A three-story apartment building collapsed. Its top story was
left intact _ its windows looking out at street level.
   Loretta Mild, a resident of San Francisco for 14 years, urged a
policeman to go inside the collapsed building to look for survivors.
   Officer Kris Kvale said he had been inside what was left of the
building, found nobody but conceded ``there's no way to get down
there'' below the rubble.
   Daddy Paul's, a Chestnut Street bar, remained open after the
quake, doing brisk business by candlelight, though it was not a
boisterous scene.
   ``We just stopped in here to get out of the earthquake,'' said
Bob Levine, who was aboard his boat when the quake hit.
   ``It jumped out of the water a little at first and then twice.''
   Levine said he helped fire fighters carry hoses and carry a burn
victim out of the big apartment fire, then helped shut off four
public gas mains before ending up at the bar to meet friends.
   Red Cross officials set up a relief center at the Marina middle
school, bringing in supplies and cots as several hundred people
crowded at the entrance to get in.
   Elsewhere, two Cambodian families set up a makeshift camp on a
park lawn after massive cracks opened in the walls of their old
apartment building.
   Chhoeut Sun, 12, said his family could not go back home, had no
food and would remain in the camp.
