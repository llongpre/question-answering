   An explosion at a Shell Oil refinery
touched off a huge fire Tuesday night that injured at least two
people and sent a plume of smoke thousands of feet into the air,
authorities said.
   ``It rattled all the windows in my home,'' said Robert Langston,
a Benicia resident who lives seven miles from the plant.
   Jane Tocher, an engineering assistant at Shell, said the plant
was shut down following the explosion about 6:35 p.m., but the fire
continued to burn out of control two hours later. Ambulances were
standing by at the refinery's main gate.
   Two contract employees for Shell were injured and taken to
Brookside Hospital in San Pablo. One man had second-degree burns on
25 percent of his body, mainly on his back and arms, said hospital
spokeswoman Cynthia Crawford. He was reported in good condition in
the hospital's burn unit.
   The other worker also was in good condition with second-degree
burns.
   The flames in the light-oil processing unit came from ``bleed-off
valves'' in pipes designed to burn off excess fuel during an
accident, said Shell spokesman Bill Sharkey. The unit, which
occupies about 15 acres of the 800-acre facility, is entirely
constructed of metal.
   The cause of the explosion and fire were unknown, he said.
   Neighborhoods were not being evacuated, but the sky over Martinez
was thick with black smoke that billowed several thousand feet into
the sky over the plant.
   The smoke gradually was being blown northeastward toward the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which is sparsely populated. It
stretched for more than 15 miles by early evening.
   Residents throughout the region said they heard a big blast
followed by a loud rushing sound, which one San Francisco radio
caller described as ``like three jet engines starting up.''
   Langston said the roaring sound lasted five minutes.
   The big explosion was followed by more than a dozen smaller ones,
some of which could be felt as far away as the original blast and
several releasing large balls of fire over the proceccing unit.
   Shell firefighters were handling the blaze. Martinez city
firefighters were at the plant's gate, but had not been asked to
help. A county fire truck was loaned to Shell.
   The refinery is 40 miles northeast of San Francisco on the
Carquinez Strait, a 10 mile stretch of water that run from the San
Francisco Bay to the delta.
