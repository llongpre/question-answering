   A 15-second earthquake caused a
transportation nightmare that will last for months as Bay area
residents cope with collapsed freeways, damaged bridges, landslides
and twisted rail lines.
   With major arteries closed between San Francisco to points south
and east, freeways jammed up starting at dawn today in the populous
southern section from from Hayward in the east to Gilroy in the
west. Traffic in the northern part of the nine-county region was
lighter, but gridlock was expected by midday.
   ``This is just a nightmare. This is something nobody ever
believed would happen, to cut San Francisco off from the East
Bay,'' said Andrew Nevin, 41, of Oakland, who got up at 3 a.m. to
drive into San Francisco.
   Nevin, who normally commutes 18 miles, had a circuitous 45-mile
trek.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit line between San Francisco and
Oakland closed Wednesday because of a reported leak in the tube
under San Francisco Bay but it reopened later. The load today was
slightly less than the normal 50,000, said spokesman Mike Healy.
``We expect people will be coming in a little later than usual
because they're trying to figure out how best to get into the
city.''
   That link had become especially vital after the quake cut off a
main route _ the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, where a 50-foot
section collapsed. The subway closing left ferries as the only
remaining direct link between the cities. Ferry service was
bolstered from Southern California vessels.
   Motorists still may get across the bay using bridges north or
south of the Bay Bridge, but each is at least 25 miles out of the
way.
   California Department of Transportation officials said the
collapsed section of the Bay Bridge was to be lifted today so they
could estimate how long repairs will take.
   The quake also collapsed a 1\-mile section of Interstate 880, a
major artery near the bridge in Oakland. Authorities estimated 250
people were killed when the highway's upper deck fell onto the
lower level during rush hour.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who viewed the
wreckage Wednesday from the air, said repairs could take 18 months.
``One of the things you are going to have to do is to plan how you
are going to in the next year or year and a half deal with the fact
that 880 is not going to be operational.''
   In an effort to ease the burden for commuters, Los Angeles-based
Catalina Cruises sent four 700-passenger vessels to supplement
ferry service, said Terry Koenig, general manager.
   Closer to the quake's epicenter, about 55 miles south of San
Francisco, a landslide closed Highway 17 linking the Bay area with
Santa Cruz. Del Corral, of Raisch Construction, said it will take
at least two months to clear.
   Repairing the crippled highway network will cost at least $500
million, Caltrans officials told the state Transportation
Commission. Caltrans also said surveyors were inspecting about
1,500 bridges within 50 miles of the epicenter.
   Quake-damaged rail lines into Oakland from Los Angeles stopped
Amtrak's northbound Coast Starlight at Salinas, about 60 miles from
San Francisco, said spokeswoman Sue Martin. Amtrak provided buses
to either Martinez or Sacramento, where other trains continued the
trip into the Pacific Northwest.
   There were no immediate estimates on when the Amtrak lines would
be fixed.
   The historic Amtrak passenger terminal in West Oakland likely
will be torn down because it was so damaged, officials said.
   San Francisco International Airport was open, but some airlines
cut operations due to quake-damaged terminals. United Airlines' Joe
Hopkins said the quake forced the carrier to cancel 16 of 136 daily
flights Wednesday.
   Oakland Airport also was open, but its main runway was closed.
