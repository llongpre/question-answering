   Back-to-back Super Bowl victories and a San
Francisco Bay area World Series provide bright but bittersweet
highlights for Northern Californians bowed under by a deadly
earthquake and string of ghastly crimes.
   Names in the news in the past year included a teamload of sports
stars and a busload of bad guys and alleged bad guys who share Page
One in local papers.
   While the San Francisco 49ers football team returned from New
Orleans on Monday after destroying the Denver Broncos 55-10, Mayor
Art Agnos awaited receipt of a dead fish. The Rocky Mountain trout
isn't a threat, it's the centerpiece of a dinner Agnos won in a
Super Bowl bet with the mayor of Denver.
   Led by quarterback Joe Montana, San Francisco took the Super
Bowl trophy home for the fourth time as the National Football
League's first repeat champion in a decade.
   The team made a triumphant return to the city Monday in a
downtown victory parade attended by 75,000 fans. Fans cheered ``Go
Niners!'' and sounded red plastic horns as Montana, coach George
Seifert, team owner Eddie DeBartolo and other players rode by in
flashy convertibles.
   The 49ers are being hailed as the ``team of the decades'' _ the
'80s and the '90s _ and the symbol of the region's resilience after
a year of disasters left it rattled but not ruined.
   ``It helped tremendously,'' Leo Bigley, 30, said of the 49ers
victory. ``The quake happened right during the football and
baseball seasons and took the spirit out of it. When the Niners
came back, it wasn't hysteria but all felt a commitment to this as
a way to show we can rebuild.''
   Or as San Francisco Examiner columnist Rob Morse wrote, ``The
49ers once again showed kinky San Francisco that dominance can be
thrilling.''
   Not far from the parade route, crews worked to repair damage on
Marina Boulevard caused by the Oct. 17 earthquake that destroyed
stylish homes, sparked fires and knocked out utility service for
weeks.
   Thousands were left homeless and 67 people died in the 7.1
shudder centered in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three months later,
families still live in shelters from the farming community of
Watsonville to San Francisco.
   Alternative routes of transportation had to be found for those
attending the remaining World Series baseball games between the San
Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics in October. The quake struck
as Game 3 was about to begin at San Francisco's Candlestick Park.
The Athletics won the series, 4-0.
   Giants' pitcher Dave Dravecky became a hero without even
playing. Dravecky returned to baseball last year after surgery to
remove a malignant tumor from his left arm. After a dramatic
first-game-back victory, the weakened bone snapped as he won his
second post-operation start.
   Northern California children were the focus of other news in
1989.
   Last January a man clad in military fatigues and armed with an
Chinese assault rifle killed five children and wounded 30 other
students and one teacher when he opened fire at Cleveland
Elementary School in Stockton, 75 miles east of San Francisco. He
then shot and killed himself.
   Authorities said Patrick Purdy, 24, had acted out a hatred for
minorities and chose children because of their vulnerability.
   Children also were among the alleged victims of Ramon Salcido,
charged with the slayings of his wife, two daughters and four
others during a bloody rampage last April in the scenic wine
country north of San Francisco. A widespread manhunt ended with
Salcido's arrest in Mexico.
   Death also was the fate of former Black Panther leader Huey
Newton, shot in East Oakland in August by a man police say was
trying to win favor with a drug-dealing street gang.
