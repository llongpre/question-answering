   The Pentagon, awaiting a request for aid from
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was prepared to offer
whatever support is necessary to aid California earthquake victims,
spokesman Pete Williams said today.
   ``We are awaiting orders from FEMA. We are willing to respond
whenever we hear from them,'' Williams said.
   The Pentagon reported in a mid-day update that damage to
military facilities in the area around San Francisco was
``comparatively minor.''
   Structural damage, power outages, disruption of water supplies
and some broken gas lines were reported.
   Maj. Gen. Todd P. Graham, the deputy commanding general of the
6th Army headquarters at the Presidio in San Francisco, has been
named the disaster control officer on the scene, the Pentagon said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered representatives from the
armed forces to set up an emergency working group to help
coordinate efforts to aid California earthquake victims, the
Pentagon said in a statement.
   Cheney asked that the group, formally known as the Directorate
of Military Support, assist and coordinate relief efforts with FEMA.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Jim Wood said a pier buckled at the Alameda
Naval Air Station, causing two minor injuries. The 2,616-acre air
station, which serves as a site to overhaul and rebuild planes,
also reported major damage to its runways.
   People injured in the quake were being treated at the Letterman
Army Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Naval Hospital in
Oakland, where 100 beds were made available. Fort Ord, near
Monterey, was providing blood, the Pentagon said.
   In addition, about 20 military police from the Army base at the
Presidio in San Francisco, located near the Golden Gate bridge,
were helping local police to control traffic near the base.
   Naval vessels _ the frigate USS Lang, the replenishment oiler
USS Kansas City and the ammunition ship USS Flint _ were also
providing support. The Lang was moved from the Naval Station at
Treasure Island to help fight fires. The two other ships, which
have helicopter pads on board, were to remain at anchor and offer
their helicopters to give aid where necessary, the Pentagon said.
   The guided missile cruiser USS Gridley was also providing fresh
water and other resources for the Navy's training facilities on
Treasure Island, Wood said.
   The Naval Air Station at Moffet Field, located near Sunnyvale,
Calif., south of San Francisco, was allowing civilian aircraft to
land at the request of the Federal Aviation Administration, the
Pentagon statement said.
