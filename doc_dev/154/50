Los Angeles residents last night feared further damage to their homes as
after-shocks hit the city following a severe earthquake that left at least
24 people dead.
Emergency shelters quickly filled up and thousands of people were evacuated
from damaged homes in the San Fernando Valley, a suburban expanse of about
3m inhabitants. Seismic experts warned of a 1 in 4 chance of another big
earthquake in coming days.
President Bill Clinton declared southern California a federal disaster area,
paving the way for low-interest loans and emergency funds, after yesterday's
quake which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale and badly disrupted transport
and communications. About 100 fires broke out around the city as gas pipes
ruptured while 1m people were left without power.
In the suburban town of Northridge, the epicentre of the quake north-west of
central Los Angeles, emergency workers pulled 14 bodies out of a
three-storey block of flats that partly caved in. 'It was like a bomb going
off,' said a third-floor resident who escaped over a balcony. 'One big jolt,
it lifted the building up off its foundation, pulled it over and slammed it
down within a three-second period.'
People were also feared trapped inside a collapsed multi-storey car park at
Northridge's shopping centre. Officials said a streetsweeper was still alive
even though tons of rubble had fallen on his vehicle.
In Sylmar in the San Fernando valley aerial television photographs showed
whole streets in flames. Residents of a Sylmar mobile-home park huddled
together, sobbing and embracing each other, as they watched their trailer
homes go up in flames. Dozens of cars lining the streets exploded from the
intense heat of gas fires.
Reports said that 50 buildings in Hollywood were also destroyed and the
quake caused many houses to slide off their foundations. Up to 1,000
buildings in the city were damaged, including two hospitals, which have been
closed. Other hospitals said they were 'inundated with walking wounded' and
officials said transport conditions were 'horrendous'.
The earthquake, which was felt 300 miles away in Las Vegas, struck at 4.31am
Pacific Standard Time, according to the US Geological Service. Had it struck
two hours later, in the rush hour, fatalities would probably have been much
higher, officials said. Yesterday's Martin Luther King holiday also meant
that many businesses were closed.
Among the dead was a motorcycle policeman thrown off a highway when the
quake split the road in two. Several raised freeways to the north and west
of the city collapsed. The Santa Monica freeway, the busiest in the US, was
severely damaged.
Most of the main arteries to and through the San Fernando Valley were badly
damaged. The entire area was without water.
The stark pictures of the pancaked roadways in Los Angeles, the US's second
biggest city, are reminiscent of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, which
registered 7.1 on the Richter scale, and in which more than 50 people died.
Repairs and reinforcements to San Francisco's freeway system are not
expected to be completed for another two years.
The city's airports, which were closed immediately after the earthquake,
reopened by mid-morning. However, delays were exacerbated by more than 200
after-shocks, including four measuring over 5 on the Richter scale.
Telephone services to the Los Angeles area were yesterday limited to
emergency calls and 1,500 national guards were deployed to assist emergency
workers, amid reports of looting.
