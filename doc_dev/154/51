   A Continental Airlines jetliner over the
Sierra Nevada shuddered for several minutes with severe vibrations
Friday, forcing an emergency landing that revealed part of the tail
section was scorched.
   The crew of the Boeing 737 with 69 people aboard made a normal
landing at San Francisco International Airport about 1 p.m. and
taxied to a gate on its own, officials said. There were no injuries
reported.
   After the plane landed, a scorched area about 10 feet in diameter
was discovered on the tail. There also appeared to be damage to the
stabilizer, the horizontal portion of the tail that helps control
the plane's attitude.
   Dave Messing, a Continental spokesman in Houston said it was
believed that the problem was in the plane's auxiliary power unit,
or APU. ``There was an APU malfunction, possibly resulting in an
overheating condition,'' he said.
   An aviation source who had a chance to inspect the plane said a
fire had damaged the stabilizer on the tail section near the APU,
but he said the power unit itself was not charred.
   ``It (the stabilizer) is burned on the outside. The paint is
burned off. But they don't know how it occurred,'' said the source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the only possible
source of ignition in the charred area appeared to be one of the
plane's strobe lights.
   R.E. ``Griff'' Greffenius, a business traveler from Walnut Creek,
Calif., said after he got off the plane, he noticed a large part of
the tail section appeared to be burned.
   During the flight, the vibrations were severe and lasted several
minutes, Greffenius said. They were followed by several minutes of
silence, he said.
   ``Then the pilot came on and said, `Obviously, we're having a
vibration problem and we're going back to Oakland,''' said
Greffenius.
   There was ``obvious damage to the tail,'' Greffenius said. ``The
paint in a fairly large area of the tail section appears to be
scorched.''
   Ron Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport,
said he heard the pilot during the landing and was unaware the
incident was as serious as Greffenius described.
   Wilson said he watched the aircraft land and hadn't noticed any
serious problems. ``The pilot reported vibrations. He made a normal
landing,'' he said. The Sierra Nevada is about 200 miles east of the
San Francisco Bay area. The plane had been bound for Denver.
