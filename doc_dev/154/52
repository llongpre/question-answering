   A general-alarm fire caused heavy damage
to a huge grocery distribution center, sending flames into the sky
early today that could be seen for miles.
   Firefighters contained the blaze, which began Monday night, but
said it could burn for hours and consume about a third of the
Safeway Stores building, which covers about 500,000 square feet.
   ``We are just trying to stop it before it destroys everything,''
said Police Sgt. Roy Howard, spokesman for the joint fire-police
department fighting the flames at the eight-building complex.
   The blaze and massive clouds of smoke could be seen across San
Francisco Bay in downtown San Francisco, about 15 miles to the
southwest.
   ``The big problems here are the size, the magnitude,'' Howard
said of the fire, punctuated by occasional explosions, in the
one-million-square-foot complex.
   No injuries were reported among the 600 workers who were at
their jobs when the blaze erupted about 10 p.m. in the wooden
structure, built about 35 years ago.
   ``It moved just way too fast to do anything about it,'' said
employee Chris Karajanis, 19, who was a few feet from where the
fire started in paper products stacked on pallets.
   He said a worker with a forklift tried to move the burning items
to isolate them but the flames burned so quickly the man gave up.
   ``First a number of us tried to put the fire out, but when we
saw there was no hope we evacuated the warehouse,'' said Dennis
Flores, a shipping foreman.
   Strong winds sent flaming debris flying for hundreds of feet in
several directions, setting fire to grass outside.
   Some 50 firefighters and 11 engines, the entire department in
this city of 100,000 people, responded, as well as fire units from
three nearby communities, Howard said.
   The warehouse supplies Safeway stores in Northern California and
parts of Nevada.
