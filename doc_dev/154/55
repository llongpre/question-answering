   A wind-whipped fire racing through
the Gold Rush country of the Sierra Nevada foothills Monday
destroyed 138 homes and other structures and forced more than 8,000
people to evacuate.
   Some 4,500 residents of the Lake Wildwood area, where some
houses cost $1 million, were forced from their homes twice in the
past two days as the out-of-control wildfire raged through rugged
terrain.
   Late Monday, hundreds more were ordered from the communities of
Smartville, Rough and Ready and Penn Valley, said state Office of
Emergency Services spokesman David Sandino, bringing to 3,500 the
number evacuated from that area in two days.
   Two firefighters were injured and others had to dive for cover
as capricious winds drove the fire through timber and dry brush
about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento, or about 150 miles
northeast of San Francisco.
   The latest evacuations were ordered after the fire's 70-foot
flames jumped a highway and headed southwest, threatening hundreds
of scattered rural dwellings.
   ``There are hundreds here and they are pouring in,'' said Red
Cross worker Elizabeth Quirk, at the Nevada Union High School
evacuation center. ``The school buses are bringing in senior
citizens, and there are campers and motor homes in the parking
lot.''
   By late Monday, the blaze dubbed the 49er Fire had burned an
estimated 15,000 acres, or nearly 25 square miles, of western
Nevada County. Flames threatened the high technology Grass Valley
Group, the county's largest employer with 1,000 workers.
Authorities said the fire reached three sides of the company's
grounds, and that a storage shed had been burned.
   The Yuba County Board of Supervisors met in emergency session in
Marysville to declare the zone a local disaster area, and expressed
concern that the fire may threaten Beale Air Force Base near
Marysville, 20 miles to the west of the fire and the home base of
the SR-71 ``Blackbird'' spy plane.
   The blaze was fueled by drought-dry brush, wood shake roofs and
propane tanks which exploded like small bombs in the intense heat,
said state Department of Forestry spokesman Charlie Jakobs.
   The destroyed structures were valued at $9 million, according to
the U.S. Forest Service. Along with 84 homes, 54 outbuildings also
were razed, said Ann Westling, a Forest Service spokeswoman. She
said the figure represented only a preliminary estimate of losses
and that it could climb higher.
   Two firefighters were burned when their truck was caught in
flames. One suffered leg burns, was wrapped in wet gauze and taken
by helicopter to a nearby hospital. The other man was treated at
the scene.
   About 40 men in two fire crews were forced to use their portable
fire shelters when wind shifted suddenly and swept the flames over
them.
   Flames engulfed a bulldozer, forcing the operator to wrap
himself in an asbestos blanket and take refuge under the vehicle.
   It was one of 11 fires that destroyed nearly 30,000 acres of
timber and brush in five rural California counties Monday.
   Residents of this affluent mountain town of 4,500 people 45
miles northeast of Sacramento and the tiny town of Rough and Ready
were evacuated Sunday, and Highway 49 was closed.
   They were allowed to begin returning home Monday morning, but
were ordered evacuated again later.
   Smartville, evacuated later, is about 15 miles west of the
Nevada City-Grass Valley area, the largest communities in the
region. Penn Valley and Lake Wildwwood are about six miles west of
Nevada City.
   A force that had grown to 1,700 firefighters saved the majority
of the resort homes, but flames destroyed 13 large resort homes,
five boats and a dock. Nineteen other structures outside of the
Lake Wildwood area were destroyed, including several residential
trailers and agricultural buildings.
   It skipped through the community, burning yards and oak trees
between large houses, some valued at $1 million.
   In some places, flames reached the town lake, igniting marina
railings, several boats and a dock.
   ``I was coming back from the Bahamas, sitting in San Francisco
International Airport, and I see my father's house burning on
television,'' said insurance agent Don Sanzone, 41. He said the
3,000-square-foot home was destroyed even though it was separated
from the forest by pavement.
   ``It's amazing, one burns down right in between others that
don't, and this one that burned had a tile roof.'' said Fes
Venardi, 67, who lives two house away from one destroyed home.
   ``I never thought this would happen,'' Sanzone said. ``I didn't
think there was enough underbrush, but the wind was blowing so
bad.''
   Wind was estimated at 25 to 30 mph Monday throughout most of
northern California, but higher gusts were reported on the fire
lines.
   ``The wind is our biggest enemy out here today,'' said Jakobs.
``We had a solid front of fire about a half-mile long moving at a
rapid rate through dense brush and timber.''
   The 49er fire reportedly started along Highway 49 _ named for
the 1849 Gold Rush towns it winds among _ about six miles north of
Nevada City by a transient burning toilet paper.
   The fire spread southwest away from the nearest populated areas.
But pushed by gusting winds, it quickly skipped in a matter of
hours over nearly 10 miles of unpopulated foothills to the posh
Lake Wildwood area.
   A second Nevada County fire burned along Highway 49 in an area
of brush, light timber and scattered homes midway between Grass
Valley and Auburn.
   Most schools were closed in the region. Thick smoke made it
unsafe to operate school buses, and the Red Cross converted at
least three schools into temporary evacuation centers.
   The Lake Wildwood residents, some of whom fought alongside fire
crews, were first pulled out Sunday. They were allowed to return
early today only to be ordered out later, said Jakobs.
   State Department of Forestry information officer John Carter
said about 5,000 state, federal and local firefighters were
battling nine other timber and brush fires Monday, mostly in remote
areas. No homes were destroyed in any of those blazes.
