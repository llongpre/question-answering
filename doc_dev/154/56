   A day of somber remembrance gave way to a
night of celebration as survivors of the San Francisco Bay quake
marked its anniversary at a restaurant that stayed open a year ago
for those needing a good stiff one.
   ``To some people, it's like surviving the Titanic. They were
panicky a year ago, but now they're just happy,'' Alexander
Mortacavi, owner of L'Entrecote de Paris, said Wednesday night on
the anniversary of the Oct. 17, 1989 earthquake.
   Earlier Wednesday, people throughout the Bay area fell silent or
wept at 5:04 p.m., the moment the quake hit. Church bells tolled
and mourners in Oakland heaped white carnations near where the
Cypress Freeway collapsed and killed 42 people.
   The quake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 67
people throughout the Bay area and caused $7 billion in damage.
   ``My daughter is still scared, that's why I brought her out
here,'' said Jennifer Martinez, who gathered with 3-year-old Jenel
and several hundred others in the town square in Watsonville. The
town 70 miles south of San Francisco was one of the hardest hit.
   In Oakland, grief mixed with celebration as about 200 residents
gathered near the double-deck Cypress Freeway.
   ``A year ago today, we heard the loudest noise ever heard in
Oakland,'' said Paul Cobb, head of the Citizens Emergency Relief
Team, a neighborhood group. ``We saw neighbors grabbing ladders out
of their basements. Those who stood on corners with nothing to do
all of the sudden rose to the occasion.''
   People across the nation first knew something had happened when
the TV signal from the 1989 World Series between the Oakland
Athletics and San Francisco Giants at San Francisco's Candlestick
Park wnt dead.
   At the stadium Wednesday, Mayor Art Agnos said the disaster
``tested our character as a city and a people.''
   ``Those were some of California's most terrifying few seconds,''
Gov. George Deukmejian said at an earthquake conference in San
Francisco. ``But they were followed by some of the finest hours of
our society.''
   At L'Entrecote de Paris, Mortacavi recalled how the Financial
District hot spot stayed open after the quake because so many
people in the neighborhood ``insisted they needed a drink.''
   ``They came again tonight because they all wanted to be together
again,'' he said.
   ``We came back to celebrate surviving,'' said Roberta Aregger, a
patron.
   Much of the Bay area is still rebuilding and many people are
still shaken.
   San Francisco's AfterQuake Project, a mental health hot line,
was deluged with calls Wednesday. ``A lot of people are feeling
some anxiety about crossing the bridge. They are looking at the
weather,'' said counselor Alexandra Charusofsky.
   The mid-day temperature Wednesday was 80, about 10 degrees above
normal - ``earthquake weather'' according to some theories. On Oct.
17, 1989, the high was 83.
   In Watsonville, residents blessed the latest home to be rebuilt
since the disaster.
   In seaside Santa Cruz, more than 1,500 people gathered at the
Town Clock near Pacific Garden Mall, the still-devastated retail
zone where three people died.
   ``Don't just remember the bricks on the pavement, remember how
great it was downtown on a sunny day,'' Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt said.
``Think about what we can rebuild and create. ... Think of the
future.''
   She and others wiped away tears as residents observed one minute
of silence, beginning at 5:04 p.m., and then sang ``This Land is
Your Land.''
   At the Ferry Building in San Francisco, 1,000 people cheered as
the flag was raised for the first time since the quake.
   In San Francisco's Marina District, where the quake caused fires
and destroyed blocks of expensive homes, anniversary events were
scheduled before and after the actual date to avoid heavy media
coverage.
   ``People here are trying to get through the day,'' said Maggie
McCall, publisher of the Marina Times, a neighborhood newspaper.
``We don't like to be inhospitable, but we don't like people
staring at us all the time. It's hard for a lot of people.''
