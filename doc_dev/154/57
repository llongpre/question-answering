   Passengers aboard a Continental Airlines
jetliner sat in stunned silence when a fire on the plane's tail
created severe vibrations so severe the pilot made an emergency
landing. No one was injured.
   The Boeing 737 en route from Oakland, Calif., to Denver with 69
people aboard landed safely Friday at San Francisco International
Airport, officials said.
   The vibrations, which began over the Sierra Nevada about 200
miles east of San Francisco, lasted several minutes and were
followed by several minutes of silence on the airliner.
   ``There was no panic as far as people screaming. It's just that
people were quite concerned,'' said R.E. ``Griff'' Greffenius, a
business traveler from Walnut Creek, Calif.
   Officials discovered a charred area about 10 feet in diameter at
the rear of the tail. There also appeared to be damage to the
stabilizer, the horizontal portion of the tail that helps control
the plane's altitude.
   An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board's
Los Angeles office examined the plane Friday night, and two more
investigators were to arrive today, said Ron Schleede, chief of the
Aviation Accident Division of the safety board.
   Continental officials in Houston said they believed the plane's
auxiliary power unit, or APU, overheated. An aviation source who had
a chance to inspect the plane said a fire had damaged the stabilizer
on the tail section near the APU, but he said the power unit itself
was not charred.
   ``It (the stabilizer) is burned on the outside. The paint is
burned off. But they don't know how it occurred,'' said the source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said a possibile cause could
have had something to do with one of the plane's strobe lights.
   David Messing, a spokesman for Continental in Houston, said there
was no indication of sabotage on the twin-engine jet, which carried
64 passengers and a crew of five.
