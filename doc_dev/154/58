<LEADPARA>  Fremont and San Francisco are warring over peace.;    Representatives of the
liberal city known affectionately in other times as "Baghdad by the Bay" and
the suburban community known for its conservative politics have fired verbal
volleys at each other over San Francisco's plans for a parade welcoming troops
home from the Persian Gulf.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Fremont city officials don't think San Francisco deserves to host the
parade.;    Mayor Bill Ball accused his San Francisco counterpart, Art Agnos,
of hypocrisy for first supporting a resolution declaring San Francisco a
sanctuary for conscientious objectors and then jumping behind plans for a
victory parade for those who went to war.;    "They have a right to do that,"
Ball, a World War II veteran, said Wednesday. "They're a strange city, anyway.
They do a lot of strange things over there.";    Councilman Gary Mello called
Agnos' positions disgusting.;    Agnos' office fired back an immediate
response.;    "Don't they have anything better to do in Fremont?," asked Scott
Shafer, a press secretary who dismissed the Fremont comments as pettiness.;   
Rival parade plans;  San Francisco representatives are huddling with Army and
Navy officials to plan the parade, while Ball is talking with the city staff
and veterans groups about a celebration in Central Park, perhaps on Memorial
Day or July 4. Both cities are waiting to see when local troops will actually
return home from the gulf.;    Ball said Fremont "epitomizes an all-American
city." He said Fremont has a diverse ethnic population, is patriotic and has a
low crime rate.;    Anti-war protesters in Fremont supported the troops and
"didn't whack the cops and burn cars" as did protesters in San Francisco, Ball
said.;    S.F. position 'consistent';  Shafer defended his city's positions as
"perfectly consistent": on one hand, defending a person's right to disagree
with the government, and on the other, supporting the troops.;    "No one has
a corner on patriotism, not the Fremont City Council, . . . no city, not
anyone," Shafer said.;    Ball replied: "I don't think they represent what the
country is all about."  </TEXT>
