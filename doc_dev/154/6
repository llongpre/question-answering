   Howling winds clocked at up to 102 mph
battered Northern California on Thursday, claiming at least one
life, overturning trucks, toppling trees and cutting power to more
than 440,000 electric customers.
   The winds littered scenic Northern California with downed power
lines, branches and trash, and authorities closed dangerous highways
and issued travel warnings.
   The San Francisco Bay waterfront was ravaged by the winds, which
tore yachts adrift, sank several and sent waves up to 10 feet high
slamming into seawalls. A 60-foot floating dock at San Francisco's
Pier 43 sank.
   ``We've had lots of trees knocked down, power outages and phone
problems,'' said Dan Nicholas of Sonoma County Emergency Services in
Santa Rosa, north of San Francisco. ``Some homes have been damaged
to the point where the people had to be evacuated and put up in
motels overnight.''
   Three-year-old Oli Asghar died Thursday in a Berkeley apartment
fire sparked by a candle used because of a wind-caused power outage.
His parents and three brothers and sisters were left homeless, fire
officials said.
   Some 442,000 Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. customers throughout
Northern California were left in the dark by the winds, said
officials for the utility whose repair crews worked through the
night.
   ``This is definitely ... one of the largest outages because of
the velocity of the winds,'' said PG&amp;E spokesman Ron Rutkowski.
   The winds also delayed the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson from
reaching its dock in San Francisco Bay. The carrier was scheduled to
arrive Thursday following a six-month tour, but Navy officials
postponed the homecoming until Friday.
   Winds weren't the only weather problem in Northern California.
Driving snow Thursday afternoon forced the closure of Highway 101
from Paso Robles to San Luis Obispo, a 30-mile stretch about 230
miles south of San Francisco.
   The winds were caused by the strong flow of air from a high
pressure system over British Columbia to a low pressure center in
Southern California and Nevada, said National Weather Service
meteorologist Randy Hartley.
   In northern Utah, the same ``upper air'' weather system brought
gusting winds up to 115 mph to northern Utah, said meteorologist
Bill Alder. Winds there felled power lines, toppled tractor-trailer
trucks, delayed mail deliveries, closed schools and fanned several
brush fires early Thursday.
   Utah Power &amp; Light Co. crews worked into the afternoon to restore
electricity at the sites of scattered outages throughout a
four-county area.
   UP&amp;L spokesman Dave Mead said he had no firm estimate on the
number of people left without electricity, but said ``you certainly
would be safe saying several thousand.''
   In California, power lines strewn across heavily traveled
Lakeville Highway near Petaluma, about 40 miles north of San
Francisco, forced authorities to close it overnight. Two private
planes at the Petaluma airport apparently were damaged by the winds,
said Nicholas.
   About 3,000 Navy personnel aboard the USS Carl Vinson, returning
from a six-month deployment to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and
North Arabian Sea, had their holiday port call delayed several hours
because of the winds.
   Petty Officer John Gwinn, aboard the huge ship, said he was eager
to reach shore where his wife, Sheree, and 3-month-old son, Robert,
were waiting.
   ``For me, it's hard. I've never seen my kid,'' he said.
   Winds clocked at more than 50 mph howled around San Francisco Bay
waterfronts, and the Coast Guard was kept busy retrieving small
boats torn from their moorings. Sausalito police said a tugboat sank
early Thursday.
   Famed attorney Melvin Belli's 110-foot motor yacht ``Adequate
Award'' was also damaged when a boat dragged its anchor across
Richardson Bay and slammed into it at Schoonmaker Marina.
   A controlled-burn fire in Tuolumne County flared because of the
winds and burned 100 acres on Thursday. Several small fires were
also reported in the Stanislaus National Forest.
   Other wind-related problems included malfunctioning elevators in
San Francisco, delayed flights and re-routed air traffic at San
Francisco International Airport and closure of the Richmond-San
Rafael Bridge to pickups with camper shells and other broad-sided
vehicles.
   The winds, blowing northward, were clocked at 102 mph early
Thursday atop Mt. Diablo about 40 miles east of San Francisco, where
remote sensing gear is located, said meteorologist Mike Pechner. The
wind hit 80 mph Wednesday night. Hurricane force winds are 74 mph or
greater.
