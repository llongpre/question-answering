   Gov. George Deukmejian today signed a
12-bill earthquake relief package, including a temporary sales tax
hike to raise $800 million.
   ``We're going to do whatever is necessary to restore the lives
and the homes of the people who were victims of this quake,''
Deukmejian said as he began signing the bills.
   As Mayor Art Agnos and a dozen legislators looked on, Deukmejian
signed the relief package at 11:45 a.m. after riding a ferry boat
across the San Francisco Bay from Oakland.
   Although state lawmakers approved the temporary sales tax
increase for earthquake relief, the package was nearly derailed by
partisan bickering.
   Legislators completed a hectic three-day special session over
the weekend, but only after rejecting claims that the sales tax
hike was insufficient or premature.
   The Oct. 17 quake killed at least 66, injured 3,000 and did an
estimated $7 billion damage in Northern California. The levy,
intended to raise $800 million, would take effect Dec. 1.
   ``I congratulate the Legislature on its quick action on the
earthquake relief package to assist the earthquake victims in
rebuilding their lives, businesses and communities,'' Deukmejian
said.
   State and federal aid, the Republican governor said, ``should
provide the necessary resources in order to restore some semblance
of normalcy in the Bay area.''
   Some legislators of both parties criticized the plan, which
raises the sales tax to as much as 7 cents on the dollar, depending
on local rates. Deukmejian also plans to tap the state reserve for
$200 million.
   Some lawmakers insisted the cost of the earthquake repairs will
be much higher than the total $4.25 billion in approved federal aid
and state funds.
   ``It's going to be closer to $10 billion, believe me,'' said
Sen. Nicholas Petris, a Democrat who urged a half-cent sales tax
increase. ``This is no time to be pandering to the pockets of the
people.''
   The tax hike, opposed by most Republicans in the Assembly,
passed the lower house Saturday with two votes to spare. It passed
the Senate by 34-2.
   ``Why would anyone want to take advantage of this disaster to
raise taxes?'' asked Assemblyman Pat Nolan, a conservative
Republican who tried to block the measure.
   In other quake developments:
   _Engineers plan to create earthquake conditions on a section of
Oakland's Interstate 880 with hydraulic jacks and a massive
spinning device in an experiment to help freeway designers learn to
protect highways from quakes.
   A section near the stretch of double-decked freeway that
collapsed in the quake will be deliberately felled in the test
sometime before Christmas, said James E. Roberts, chief of the
structural division of the state Department of Transportation. Most
of the quake's victims were crushed between the freeway's decks.
   _A mild aftershock struck the San Francisco Bay area Sunday
morning, but authorities said there were no reports of damage or
injuries. The aftershock, on the San Andreas Fault and centered 8
miles east of Santa Cruz, some 60 miles south of San Francisco,
registered 4.0 on the Richter scale, said Pat Jorgenson, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey.
   _Hispanic leaders and Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., complained
that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has responded
inadequately to the needs of Spanish-speaking residents left
homeless by the quake. At the public meeting Saturday in Santa
Cruz, FEMA official Bob Stevens responded that the agency ran out
of Spanish-language applications while helping Puerto Rico
residents after Hurricane Hugo.
   _The National Football League on Sunday announced a $1 million
donation to the earthquake relief effort on behalf of the 28 teams'
owners. San Francisco 49ers owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. will add
a $250,000 contribution on behalf of his family, the NFL said.
