   Thirty-one passengers were slightly hurt in the
evacuation of a United Airlines Boeing 747 jet that made an
emergency landing in Hong Kong today, airline officials said.
   United said in a statement that a warning light had
malfunctioned, indicating a possible fire.
   The 198 passengers and crew aboard the Singapore-to-San
Francisco flight slid down emergency chutes after the jet landed
shortly before noon, said Civil Aviation Department spokesman
Patrick Wong.
   Firefighters found no trace of smoke or fire. Earlier,
government-funded radio had said there were reports of smoke
streaming from the plane.
   Authorities said most of the injuries were minor, although one
woman was taken to a hospital for treatment.
   United said passengers had been put aboard flights by other
carriers to San Francisco.
   In May, a United Airlines jet made an emergency landing in Hong
Kong shortly after taking off because of a failure in its air
conditoning system.
