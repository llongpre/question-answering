   The strong earthquake in Southern California on Wednesday
recalled the far greater tragedy that struck the San Francisco Bay
area _ and was shared by much of the nation via television _ on
Oct. 17.
   As millions of Americans were tuning in to watch the third game
of the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and cross-bay
rival Oakland Athletics, the picture began to shake.
   Viewers were seeing the first effects of a quake measuring 7.1
on the Richter scale. The temblor, centered far south of San
Francisco, killed 67 people, injured about 3,000 and did $7 billion
in damage.
   Dozens of buildings collapsed in San Francisco's marina
district, and some blocks of apartments were consumed by flames fed
by natural gas leaks. A 50-foot section of the top deck of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge fell in. Damage was widespread in
Santa Cruz and Watsonville, cities nearer the quake's center many
miles south of San Francisco.
   Worst, by far was the collapse of 1{ miles of elevated deck on
the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland.
   Over the next few days, rescuers tunneled into the rubble to
pull out 43 bodies _ and one survivor, Buck Helm. The so-called
``Miracle Man'' died later of injuries.
   The ground at the quake's center, in a wooded area called area
called Loma Prieta in Santa Cruz County, has become a tourist
attraction of sorts.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.
