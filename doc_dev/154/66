<P>
A fire spawned by Tuesday's killer earthquake blow-torched through at least two 
luxury apartment buildings in San Francisco's stylish Marina District, raging 
out of control for nearly four hours and prompting fears of many deaths amid 
the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
At least three people were cofirmed dead, including one in a nearby building. 
The unidentified man was pinned in debris and died while firefighters tried 
frantically to cut him free with a chain saw, according to San Francisco 
paramedic David Drabble. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether more people might have died, paramedic Pete Howes said: "Perhaps. 
We have to go rooting in there to find out how many. Perhaps they are still 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
The Marina inferno was among the more visible signs of calamity that emerged in 
the immediate aftermath of the mammoth temblor, which struck a wide swath of 
the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke and flames from the fire were seen for miles, and thousands of 
passers-by stopped on nearby streets to watch the buildings burn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very toxic fire, please move away!" yelled one man who said he was 
an official of the U.S. Interior Department. "This is very, very toxic." 
</P>
<P>
With power outages throughout the city, the fire cast an eerie glow over 
Divisadero and Beach streets, an upscale area located about a mile west of 
famous Fisherman's Wharf and only a few blocks from some other tourist meccas 
as the Presidio, Aquatic Park and the Palace of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake caused three buildings on two blocks of the Marina District to 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Two apartment buildings on the northwest corner of Divisadero and Beach became 
engulfed in flames about 20 minutes after the earthquake struck, nearby 
residents said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the buildings "pancaked," said Lee Phillips, an architect who works in 
her home, up the street from the fire scene. Phillips said that 20 minutes 
after the quake she heard sirens from ambulances racing to the scene, then she 
noticed smoke begin to spill out of the windows of the collapsed building, and 
then flames erupted. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the block was destroyed by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
When the earthquake occurred, Phillips said, she had trouble just scrambling 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't walk down the hallway," she said. "I fell down five times." The 
brick facade of her building fell into the street. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly woman who lives five doors down from the burning buildings said, "It 
collapsed -- totally collapsed." The woman, who asked not to be identified, 
added: "I was in such a state of shock. It's incredible. It was a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Although the exact cause of the fire was not immediately known, the smell of 
natural gas wafted through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Directly across the street from the fire, another four-story apartment building 
tumbled into the middle of the street -- the top floor suddenly becoming the 
ground floor. The wood and stucco building was tilted at an angle and there was 
no telling whether anyone was left alive inside. 
</P>
<P>
About a block east of the fire, at North Point and Scott streets, the 
earthquake instantly transformed yet another four-story apartment building into 
a one-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
William Dempsey, who lives nearby, said he was in his apartment relaxing in 
front of his television, watching the World Series game and having a beer when 
the temblor hit. 
</P>
<P>
After the shaking subsided, Dempsey said he rushed into the street, as did his 
neighbors. He said he tried to break the fire alarm box but it didn't work, so 
they went up the street and broke another fire box -- and it didn't work 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey said the neighbors ran to the building that had collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't hear any sounds coming out," Dempsey recalled as he stood across the 
street, viewing the destruction. He said one of his neighbors managed to climb 
into the top floor, which was now near street level, but he found no one there. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer who stood guard outside the collapsed building said that there 
were no confirmed fatalities there, but that authorities would not search the 
apartments until the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Marina District, the brick facades of fashionable buildings were 
scattered on streets. Several building sported large cracks -- some 6 inches in 
width. Sidewalks were buckled, resembling miniature mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
"My apartment is a disaster," said David Doiron, who said he was asleep on his 
couch when the quake struck. "I'm not going back in until we get someone to 
check the building" and make sure it's structurally sound. Everything is down. 
Plaster is off the walls. Things are off the shelves." 
</P>
<P>
As he made his comments, Doiron was holding a cat. The cat's head was buried 
deep into Doiron's lap.

Morain reported from San Francisco; Welkos reported from Los Angeles.
