   A strong earthquake startled residents
over a 350-mile expanse of Northern and Central California on
Sunday night, but authorities said there were no immediate reports
of serious damage or injuries.
   The quake hit at 6:45 p.m. and had a magnitude of 5.1 on the
Richter scale, said a spokesman for the University of California
Seismographic Stations in Berkeley. Its epicenter was on the
Calaveras Fault about 10 miles northeast of San Jose near Alum
Rock, said spokesman Anthony Lomax.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park estimated the temblor
at 5.3. Geophysicist Bill Ellsworth said the earthquake's
5-mile-long center was just north of the epicenter of a 6.2 quake
in Morgan Hill in 1984, the region's largest temblor in years.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered capable of
causing substantial damage, but authorities said they had no damage
reports worse than a few cracked ceilings and a broken water heater
and water pipe in nearby Milpitas.
   ``The whole mountain shook,'' said Al Wong, a maintenance
supervisor for the Federal Aviation Administration atop 2,571-foot
Mount Tamalpais 10 miles north of San Francisco in Marin County.
   Residents as far south as Bakersfield and as far north as Santa
Rosa flooded authorities and media with calls about the quake.
Police and sheriff's spokesmen throughout the San Francisco Bay
area, the Central Valley and Napa and Sonoma counties to the north
all said they had felt it but were unaware of any damage.
   ``It lasted longer than they usually do,'' said Santa Clara
County sheriff's Deputy Ray Dominguez. ``It came all of a sudden
and then leveled and rolled off.''
   ``It was the strongest quake I've felt here in years,'' said
meteorologist Mike Pechner of radio station KNBR in San Francisco
and a life-long resident of the area.
   A resident of Foster City on the San Francisco Peninsula said
people ran out into the street after the quake hit. A South San
Francisco resident said bottles fell off the shelf in his house and
plants were tipped over.
   Dan Trevan, a motorist who was driving over the Golden Gate
Bridge, said his car ``jumped a little bit'' during the quake.
   Bay Area Rapid Transit and Southern Pacific Railroad crews
slowed trains to check for damage to the tracks, but found none,
officials said.
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric said it had no reports of power outages
in the San Jose area adjacent to the epicenter.
   The quake was the third reported Sunday in California. Mild
earthquakes jolted Napa and Solano counties in Northern California
and the inland area of Southern California around Ontario, but
there were no reports of damage or injury.
   The Ontario quake also was felt in the cities of San Bernardino,
Fontana and Riverside, about 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
   It struck about 2:20 p.m. PDT, was centered about five miles
east-southeast of Ontario, and measured 3.4 on the Richter scale,
said Hall Daily, a spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   The temblor was the second widely felt quake to hit Southern
California since Friday, when a shaker measuring 5.2 on the Richter
scale hit 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles and was felt in much of
central and southern California.
   Daily said initial data indicated it was unlikely the Sunday
quake was related to the one which struck Friday.
   The Napa-Solano quake which measured 3.3 on the Richter scale,
occurred at 2:44 p.m., the Seismographic Stations at Berkeley
reported. The epicenter was near Lake Berryessa, about 40 miles
north of Berkeley.
   Vacaville police received dozens of calls from residents who
weren't sure what the jolt was, said dispatcher Jamie Weishaar.
   ``Many of the people were confused because it didn't feel like
an earthquake. Some people thought it might have been a sonic
boom,'' she said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in the strenth of the shaking. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage, and 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.
