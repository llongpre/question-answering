Insurance companies could be held liable for as much as $3 billion to $4 
billion in losses from Tuesday's earthquake that rocked the San Francisco Bay 
Area, Richard J. Roth Jr., assistant state insurance commissioner, said 
Wednesday. The total does not include the cost of repairing roads, bridges and 
other uninsured structures. 
</P>
<P>
While it will take insurance companies 10 days to two weeks to complete a 
comprehensive assessment, some experts estimated that insured losses could 
approach Hurricane Hugo's record $4 billion. "It's the Western version of 
Hugo," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Tuesday's quake, 1989 had become by far the worst year ever for 
catastrophes. With 2 1/2 months remaining, the year's insured losses total 
$5.64 billion, double the previous record of $2.82 billion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, insurers paid about $350 million in claims as a result of the 
Whittier quake two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, insurance stocks were among gainers in Wednesday's trading on Wall 
Street. Investors, according to some market observers, evidently bet that the 
year's heavy insured losses will provide insurance companies with a golden 
opportunity to raise premiums and fatten profits, a theory the industry 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he figures that insured losses to buildings and other structures from 
actual shaking by the Bay Area quake will total about $1 billion. Additional 
losses will be covered by insurance against fire, wrecked vehicles, medical 
costs and death -- not to mention public liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Roth's estimate did not include such major public works as the damaged San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the collapsed portion of the Nimitz Freeway in 
Oakland or repairs to the Oakland and San Francisco airports. Taxpayers will 
pick up those bills. Indeed, a Caltrans spokesman said the department is 
seeking an emergency appropriation to begin immediate public rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
As for residential damages, only about 20% of homeowners pay the extra premium 
required for earthquake coverage, the industry estimates. Although California 
law requires all insurers doing business in the state to offer earthquake 
insurance, customers are not obliged to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, insurers rushed "catastrophe teams" of claims adjusters to the 
stricken area. Los Angeles-based Farmers Group Insurance Cos. flew a team of 50 
adjusters to Pleasanton in Alameda County to set up an emergency processing 
center to handle its customers' earthquake damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers spokesman Jeffrey C. Beyer said the company insures about 250,000 
homeowners and 450,0000 motorists in the Bay Area. About two-thirds of its 
automobile policyholders buy "comprehensive" coverage, which covers personal 
injury and damage to the vehicle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fireman's Fund, based in the Marin County town of Novato, was among major 
insurers putting out a call for independent claims adjusters to help reach all 
customers within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners and businesses without earthquake insurance but covered for other 
property damages would probably not be covered for collapse from shaking but 
might collect for damage by water and fire, said Ed O'Hare, spokesman for the 
industry-supported Insurance Information Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The coincidence of multibillion-dollar national disasters happening in 
consecutive months generated shock waves among state insurance regulators, some 
of whom were meeting in Washington to discuss, among other topics, the adequacy 
of insurers' reserves for catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"What troubles us is the combination of Hugo and the earthquake coming back to 
back," said Robin Campaniano, Hawaii's insurance commissioner and head of the 
earthquake panel of the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners. "It may have 
a significant impact on insurers." 
</P>
<P>
But in California, Roth said insurance companies should be able to handle the 
expected Bay Area losses easily -- "even if it runs as high as Hurricane Hugo."
