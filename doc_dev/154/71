   In 15 seconds, as deep, jagged fissures cut
through the Santa Cruz Mountains and earthquake waves rocked a
World Series crowd, euphoria turned to fear and life may have
changed forever for millions of Californians.
   It came without warning. The only sound, close to the mile-wide,
25-mile-long ruptures along the San Andreas Fault, seemed like
distant thunder in the mountains _ until the cruel, random
destruction began.
   Then there were the sickening sounds of crashing cars, broken
glass, and crumbling houses.
   Fifteen seconds. Time enough to kill dozens, injure thousands,
displace more than 10,000 people and wreak billions of dollars
worth of damage. Time enough to send a jolt up and down the state
and across the valleys and deserts.
   In the first five seconds, the heart, and perhaps the soul, of
picturesque Santa Cruz were destroyed. Hundred-year-old homes,
survivors of the 1906 Great Quake, gone. Quaint downtown shops
reduced to rubble. Longtime residents stunned, and many later would
talk about leaving a city prized for its free-spirited lifestyle,
surfing beaches and historic boardwalk.
   About 10 seconds later, the towering Bay Bridge _ symbol of a
World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics
that had infused the Bay area with giddiness and pride _ partially
collapsed and a section of Interstate 880 came smashing down on
rush-hour commuters.
   Candlestick Park, where 62,000 fans waited for the start of Game
3 of the Series, quivered violently but didn't fall. Amazingly,
there was no panic, no stampede for the exits. Indeed, a wild roar
erupted from the fans who took the quake as an omen of the Giants'
comeback from two losses.
   At the same moment, beautiful apartment buildings and condos,
worth millions of dollars, tumbled or caught fire in San Francisco
on the soft landfill in the Marina district, a mile from
Fisherman's Wharf. Luxury cars were crushed by the bricks and
debris. Remnants of the good life lay on the sidewalks and littered
streets _ stereos, VCRS, skis, golf clubs, carried out by desperate
residents trying to salvage whatever they could.
   Oakland's ornate City Hall was rendered unusable, along with a
dozen other buildings. Homes and businesses in Silicon Valley, the
high-tech center of the nation located between Santa Cruz and San
Francisco, somehow escaped with relatively little damage.
Skyscrapers in the cities swayed but didn't fall.
   When the quake struck, it was the start of ``happy hour'' in
many restaurants and bars, and patrons were gathered to watch the
Series when suddenly bottles and glasses and mirrors flew in every
direction.
   Children waiting to be picked up from day care centers began
wailing as they tumbled among the scattering toys.
   Water sloshed out of pools, dishes fell, liquor stores and
supermarkets had bottles and groceries splattered on the floor.
   No one who survived those 15 seconds of terror at 5:04 p.m. on
Oct. 17, 1989, is likely to forget where he or she was, just as
those who lived through the Great Quake of 1906 never forgot what
happened to them.
   Whether they were injured, suffered damage to their homes or
businesses or the losses of friends or relatives, the survivors
must live with the memory of the event and the fear it could happen
again on an even larger scale.
   They are trying to return to normal life, but it is difficult
when the evidence of ruin is so widespread and more than 1,500
aftershocks have hit since.
   ``This is one of those events, like the Kennedy assassination,
that almost everyone who lived through it will remember in
detail,'' said Dr. Donald Tarver, a psychiatrist with the Mission
Crisis unit in San Francisco. ``It had a life-changing context for
those who lost homes or loved ones and it could have life-changing
consequences for many others who shared in an event with such a
wide impact.''
   It all began 10 miles underground in the mountains along the San
Andreas Fault, the boundary between the North American and Pacific
tectonic plates, which move sideways to each other at the rate of
two inches a year.
   The fault, straight in some places, curves like the letter ``S''
in the Santa Cruz area, 57 miles south of San Francisco, causing
both horizontal motions and compression, according to Robert
Uhrhammer, research seismologist for the University of
California-Berkeley Seismographic Station.
   On Tuesday, when the strain exceeded the strength of the rock,
the earth's crust ruptured, unleashing a force that Uhrhammer said
was equivalent to about 30 million tons of high explosives _ nearly
10 times the total of explosive power of all bombs in World War II,
including the two atomic bombs.
   Compression waves shot out in all directions at the rate of
18,000 mph, followed by the more damaging horizontal shear waves
traveling at 10,800 mph and elliptically shaped waves going 7,800
mph.
   Unlike the narrow, 270-mile-long split from the 1906 quake in
the same region, the new quake caused many cracks, fractures,
slides and slumps along a broader, shorter zone.
