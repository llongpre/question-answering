   People fell silent, church bells rang and
mourners heaped white carnations near the spot where a freeway
collapsed as Californians marked the first anniversary Wednesday of
Bay area earthquake.
   In West Oakland, grief mixed with celebration as about 200
residents of the drug-torn neighborhood gathered near the Cypress
Freeway, which collapsed and killed 42 people.
   Standing with rescuers, city officials and politicians, many
felt renewed pride as they recalled the efforts of neighbors who
scaled the rubble of the double-decked freeway to rescue trapped
drivers.
   ``A year ago today, we heard the loudest noise ever heard in
Oakland,'' said Paul Cobb, head of the Citizens Emergency Relief
Team, a volunteer neighborhood group. ``We saw neighbors grabbing
ladders out of their basements. Those who stood on corners with
nothing to do all of the sudden rose to the occasion.''
   The Oct. 17 quake, which measured at 7.1 on the Richter scale,
struck at 5:04 p.m. It killed 67 people.
   People across the nation knew something was wrong when the
television signal from the World Series was lost. The quake halted
the third game of the series between the Oakland Athletics and the
San Francisco Giants. The A's were again in the series - in
Cincinnati - and many spoke with quiet pride of the way
Californians helped the injured and rushed to rebuild.
   ``Those were some of California's most terrifying few seconds,''
Gov. George Deukmejian said at an earthquake conference in San
Francisco, that was also attended by Marilyn Quayle, the vice
president's wife. ``But they were followed by some of the finest
hours of our society.''
   Observances were held throughout the San Francisco Bay area. At
5:04 p.m., church bells tolled in the city and in Santa Cruz and
Watsonville. In those two two cities south of San Francisco, where
quake damage is still evident, mourners observed a moment of
silence.
   They fell silent, too, by the freeway in West Oakland.
   Richard Von Riddle, 34, of San Leandro, hopes a memorial will be
built to honor quake victims.
   ``There's 42 spirits floating down this strip right here,'' said
Richard Von Riddle, as he stood by the freeway. He hoped a memorial
would be built to those crushed.
   ``People lost their whole families,'' Von Riddle said. ``Every
time I go by, I start shaking and my heart breaks.''
   The remaining roadway that bisects the drug-infested
neighborhood of Oakland was renamed Mandela Parkway.
   ``There's been a very demonstrable renewal of hope in West
Oakland,'' said event organizer Jack Atkin. ``The earthquake was
staggering in its destructive power. God knows, there's enough
problems in West Oakland with or without an earthquake. But people
pulling together will get them solved much quicker.''
   At the Ferry Building in San Francisco, 1,000 people cheered as
the flag was raised for the first time since the quake. The
building's flagpole remained tilted long after the quake, and had
become for some a symbol of how far the recovery had to go.
   In Watsonville, where one person died, scores of residents took
to the streets to commemorate the quake. One group gathered for the
blessing of a new home, the latest to be rebuilt since the quake.
   Calls flooded into the AfterQuake Project in San Francisco, a
mental health hot line for people traumatized by the quake, after a
television station broadcast the number early Wednesday.
   ``A lot of people are feeling some anxiety about crossing the
bridge. They are looking at the weather,'' said counselor Alexandra
Charusofsky. The mid-day temperature Wednesday was 80 degrees,
about 10 degrees above normal. The day of the earthquake, the high
reached 83.
   At Candlestick Park, where the quake shook fans awaiting the
third game of the 1989 World Series, Mayor Art Agnos said the quake
``tested our preparedness, it tested our strength, and most of all,
it tested our character as a city and a people. We survived that
earthquake.''
   A French restaurant, L'Entrecote de Paris, organized a ``A
Celebration of Survival'' to recreate last year's impromptu
after-quake soiree that started when regulars begged the restaurant
not to close like others on the block.
   ``Some were frightened, some were laughing,'' said owner
Alexander Mortazavi. ``They were singing songs together. This whole
place became a party.''
   In seaside Santa Cruz, where blocks of downtown still show the
quake's destruction, residents were given the option of partying
into the night to the outdoor sounds of rock bands and ``earthquake
comedy,'' a free show by a group of San Francisco comics.
   ``The earthquake made you an instant native,'' said Bratton, a
member of the Downtown Association, one of the event organizers.
``The people who stayed are like veterans of a war, veterans of a
tragedy.''
   But nothing was scheduled Wednesday in the streets of another
hard-hit area.
   In San Francisco's Marina District, where the earthquake sparked
fires and destroyed homes, the tragedy still haunts residents.
   The Marina's anniversary events were scheduled before and after
the actual date to avoid a media onslaught.
   ``People here are trying to get through the day,'' said Maggie
McCall, publisher of the Marina Times, a neighborhood newspaper.
``We don't like to be inhospitable, but we don't like people
staring at us all the time. It's hard for a lot of people.''
