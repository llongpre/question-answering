   A series of strong earthquakes struck
Northern California today, rattling the nerves of residents in a
100-mile area from San Francisco south to Salinas on the
anniversary of the catastrophic 1906 quake.
   The hardest quake struck at 6:54 a.m. and measured a preliminary
5.4 on the Richter scale, Allen Lindh of the U.S. Geological Survey
said. The UC-Berkeley Seismographic Station measured the quake at a
preliminary 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   Both agencies said the quakes hit just east of Watsonville,
about 60 miles south of San Francisco, in the Loma Prieta area,
where the October 17 quake measured 7.1 on the Richter scale.
   The two other strong quakes today included one at 6:38 a.m. that
measured a preliminary 4.5 on the Richter scale, centered four
miles east-southeast of Watsonville, and another 4.5 quake at 6:41
a.m.
   Watsonville police dispatcher Bob Spidle described the first
quake, saying: ``It bounced. We've had lots of calls, but I've had
no reports of any damage.''
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. reported power loss to 6,500
customers in the Watsonville area.
   San Francisco police said they received many calls from worried
residents, but no damage and no injuries were reported.
   Only the night before a rally featuring displays on earthquake
safety had been held to mark the six-month anniversary of the Oct.
17, 1989, quake, which killed 68 people and caused billions in
damage. And survivors of the Great Earthquake that destroyed San
Francisco in 1906 had gathered at dawn to commemorate the occasion.
   On Tuesday, Southern California quivered from a series of
aftershocks from a February earthquake, and a small temblor hit
rural, eastern Indiana. There were no damages or injuries reported
from those two areas.
   Tuesday's quake measured 4.6 on the Richter scale and was
centered three miles west of Upland, said Robert Finn, spokesman
for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Upland is
40 miles east of Los Angeles.
   The 3:32 p.m. quake was the strongest in a swarm of minor
tremors in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Three
smaller tremors followed within two hours, all in the same area,
Finn said.
   The shocks were in an area of the San Antonio Canyon fault that
was not ruptured in the Feb. 28 quake, which measured 5.5 on the
Richter scale and inflicted some serious damage to older buildings.
   Indiana's Tuesday morning quake shook buildings, rattled windows
and woke up residents, but caused no damage, Jay County authorities
said.
   Michael Hamburger, seismologist and geology professor at Indiana
University, put the quake's magnitude at 2.5 to 3 on the Richter
scale and its epicenter in eastern Jay County, about 65 miles
northeast of Indianapolis.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, which occurred
before the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on
the Richter scale. The quake and subsequent fire were blamed for an
estimated 700 deaths.
