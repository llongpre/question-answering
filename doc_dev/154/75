   Recovery advanced into its second week
today for an earthquake-rattled region feeling an aftershock of
numbers _ a stronger Richter reading, a 50-50 chance of a new jolt
and an infusion of relief money.
   Eight people remained missing, and the death toll from the Oct.
17 temblor climbed to 63 with a coroner's discovery of a 39th
victim from double-decked Interstate 880 in Oakland.
   The state Office of Emergency Services reported today that
13,892 people have been left homeless, nearly double the previous
figure.
   The first damage claim against the state was filed by two
motorists injured in the collapse.
   The Senate today approved a $3.45 billion quake relief package.
It expands a $2.85 billion House-approved measure by adding $600
million for Small Business Administration emergency loans. The
legislation now goes back to the House.
   Damage estimates have been set at $7.1 billion, making it the
costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.
   ``We were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive power of World
War II, including the atomic bomb,'' said U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
who represents San Francisco's hard-hit Marina district.
   Santa Cruz County got a $356,460 check from state Controller
Gray Davis on Tuesday. The check is 75 percent of the money the
county already has spent on earthquake response.
   Church bells tolled at 5:04 p.m., one week to the minute after
the quake. It packed more punch than first thought, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey, which upped the magnitude to 7.1 from
6.9 on the Richter scale after checking 18 seismic stations around
the world.
   The homeless figure climbed after rain forced many into
shelters, where county officials are compiling counts of those
displaced, according to OES spokeswoman Nancy Sutton.
   A geologist warned that because of the recent rain, huge
sections of land in Santa Cruz County cracked by earthquake
fissures are in danger of sliding this winter and burying hundreds
of homes.
   ``What's happening today is frightening to geologists who have
looked at it,'' Professor Gary Griggs of the University of
California, Santa Cruz, told county supervisors Tuesday. ``I think
there's a cause for alarm, but not instant alarm until we've had
more rain.''
   Jumpy residents also were told that there is a 50-50 chance of a
5.0 aftershock during the next two months, and there is an 11
percent shot of a 6.0 shock. A 5.0 Richter reading can cause
considerable damage; 6.0 can be severe, especially to buildings
already weakened.
   An aftershock of 4.5 was registered at 6:27 p.m. Tuesday, the
latest of about 3,500 aftershocks since Oct. 17.
   ``I'm still shook up. Every time I hear a noise I jump,'' said
Ela Mae Douglas, owner of a soul food cafe near I-880.
   And for all the death and destruction, Elizabeth Patrice Cupples
celebrated her first week of life. She was born at 5:03 p.m. on
Oct. 17 by Ceasarean section, and doctors shielded her mother by
leaning over the incision.
   ``You were born and the earth moved,'' said her father, James,
who was at his wife's side in the delivery room of Santa Cruz
Community Hospital.
   In Oakland, crews were taking down sections of I-880. They fear
that still-standing sections of the state's first elevated freeway
could topple like dominoes onto the 1\-mile stretch that crumpled.
   Four sections remain inaccessible, and the search for more
bodies was delayed until at least Thursday because the road is too
shaky. Authorities have abandoned hope of finding anyone alive in
the rubble.
   Oakland police, who had said Tuesday that nine people remained
unaccounted for, revised the number to eight today but could give
no explanation for the change.
   Officials said 135 people evacuated from homes near the highway
Sunday may be allowed to return to their homes by Thursday.
   In the damage claims, which could lead to a lawsuit, Hayward
residents Milton Wade Jr. and Askia Y.M. Hurts, who were returning
from a plumbing job in Wade's car on the freeway, asked the state
to pay unspecified medical damages.
   Workers, meanwhile, removed the section of the lower deck of the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge on Tuesday. It will take at least
a month to rebuild the five-lane, 50-foot pieces. The hole in the
53-year-old bridge is as gaping as the hole in the area's
transportation system.
   Without the bridge and key sections of devastated highways,
transit officials have jury-rigged a jammed commuter system with
extra trains, ferries and other alternatives.
   Inconvenienced commuters abandoned their cars and took to public
transportation in record numbers. The Bay Area Rapid Transit by 9
a.m. Tuesday set a weekday ridership record with 99,135, 4,300 more
than the previous day.
   Meanwhile, 300 men found shelter and plentiful chow on a Navy
vessel built to deploy assault troops by helicopter. Most of the
men, part of the city's permanent homeless population, were staying
at the Moscone Convention Center but were shipped to the USS
Peleliu to make room a convention of plastic surgeons.
   ``We're getting steaks, roast beef, ham end eggs, vegetables and
snacks all day _ and regular showers _ the Navy's doin' a good
job,'' declared John Clulow on the carrier's cavernous hangar deck.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos called on the federal government
to raise the maximum home rebuilding loan to $500,000 from $100,000
because of the high housing costs in the region.
   ``One-hundred thousand dollars in South Carolina can make a big
difference. It doesn't here,'' Agnos said.
   In San Francisco alone, 750 to 1,000 buildings need extensive
repair, Agnos said. Damage in the city could reach $3.2 billion, he
said.
   Clyde Walthall, spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, said the
utility may have to replace about 10 miles of gas distribution
lines in the hard-hit Marina district. The cost: $10 million.
   About 5,100 customers are without gas service in the district,
and about 1,000 customers are also without electricity, Walthall
said.
