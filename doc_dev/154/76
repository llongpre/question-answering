   Thousands of stranded office workers
mingled with the homeless in San Francisco's darkened streets
Tuesday night as a pitch-black night, a night of fear and
festiveness, fell over this quake-damaged city by the bay.
   Fire engines and ambulances, sirens howling, picked their way
through the darkness and over glass-strewn streets as a few stars
peeked through a layer of smoke from a fire raging in the Marina
district.
   An occasional office building running on emergency generators
stood out in the blackness. Electrically powered trolleys formed
little empty holes of light where they stalled, emergency blinkers
winking on and off. Car headlights criss-crossed, pedestrians
dodging among them.
   And desperate people lined up 20 deep at pay telephones to call
home.
   ``Answer! Dammit!'' Jeff Darling yelled into one phone as he
tried to reach his wife and child across San Francisco Bay in
Berkeley after the earthquake.
   When the phone went unanswered, Darling dropped the receiver and
sobbed uncontrollably. ``I've got to know, I've got to know. What
happened?'' He said his house was undergoing renovation and he
feared that some of the supports may have been undermined by the
work.
   But on other streets, the scene seemed festive. Some fireworks
were set off, and children played outside.
   ``People are out in the streets, and it looks like a huge parade
is about to come down the street,'' said Texas State Treasurer Ann
Richards, who was walking in downtown San Francisco when the deadly
quake hit just after 5 p.m.
   But she added, ``It's really frightening.''
   After dark, with power out, people gathered in candle-lit bars
and restaurants. Groups of 10 or 20 stood on sidewalks downtown,
listening on large radios to reports on the quake. Others strolled
in a surreal promenade in the darkness. Buses were jammed with
riders, but no one appeared to panic.
   People sat outside dingy hotels, on the stoops of apartment
houses, on curbs. And thoughts turned to worrying about where to go
for food and water.
   In San Francisco's Haight-Fillmore district, cracks were visible
on some stoops and buildings, some in the stucco and some
structural. Many buildings in the neighborhood are Victorian-style
homes that survived the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906.
   John Kunze, 26, of Mountain View, said he was on an overpass
driving home from work when he ``noticed my car swaying back and
forth and I thought I had a tire blowout. It was just a scary,
eerie feeling.
   ``Then I noticed telephone polls swinging back and forth and I
knew it was an earthquake.''
   At Candlestick Park, the capacity crowd stood frozen for a
moment but cheered when the quake passed. The scoreboard and
electricity to the park were knocked out. Beer cups tumbled from
the shelves at one concession stand.
   Jim Van Sickle, who lives about 60 miles east of San Francisco,
said plates were knocked off his fireplace mantle by the earthquake.
   Asked his age, Van Sickle said, ``I was 52 before the
earthquake, but now I'm 82.''
   Downtown's thousands of office workers were left with no major
transportation routes to homes across the water in East Bay areas.
   A section of the top deck of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge collapsed onto the lower road. The subway was shut down.
Large sections of the two-tiered Nimitz Freeway collapsed onto the
lower roadway.
   Cooperation and innovation sprung up amid the paralysis, however.
   Motorists gave rides to people trying to get across town. The
owner of one office building allowed reporters to file news stories
via a facsimile machine's phone line, although the machine itself
did not work.
   Tempers flared occasionally at the lines for telephones. At one,
a shoving match broke out between a man in line and a man on the
phone. The two were pulled apart and the people in line agreed to
talk no more than three minutes each.
