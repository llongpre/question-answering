   About 40 homes in the city of Alamo were
damaged and a few homes were declared unfit for habitation after
two earthquakes rumbled through Northern California, officials said
Saturday.
   Damage included broken glass, toilets knocked off foundations,
ruptured water and gas lines and broken furniture, according to San
Ramon Valley Fire Department spokesman Mary Raymond.
   Several homes were deemed uninhabitable by inspectors with the
Contra Costa County Building Department after the temblors Friday
night, Raymond added.
   She said follow-up inspections would determine the severity of
the damage.
   Two jolts in Contra Costa County, on the Concord Fault, produced
preliminary Richter Scale readings of 4.6 and 3.9, according to the
University of California Seismographic Station in Berkeley. The
U.S. Geological Survey measured the temblors at magnitudes 4.6 and
4.3.
   The quakes were centered some 30 miles east of San Francisco,
four miles east of Walnut Creek, seismologists reported.
   The shocks swept cans and bottles off supermarket shelves and
knocked out power to thousands of homes in Concord, Danville,
Walnut Creek and Alamo, jostling the nerves of residents.
   The first hit at 9:41 p.m. and another shock hit six minutes
later. Several quakes measuring 2.5 and smaller shivered through
the area after that.
   The largest jolts were felt from Vacaville to Marin County to
San Francisco.
   A spokeswoman for the state Office of Emergency Services said
the shocks were part of the continuing series shaking the region
this month. Tremors of up to 5.5 on the Richter scale were felt in
the Bay area on April 6 and April 18. None caused any major damage.
   The 7.1-magnitude quake that hit the region Oct. 17 claimed 67
lives and caused some $7.1 billion in damage.
   At the Alamo Safeway, employees closed the store and filled
carts with bottled water and batteries to sell at the front door.
Their floors were a mess with broken bottles and scattered cans.
   Karen Allen, Walnut Creek police dispatcher, reported from her
post that ``things fell off the shelves behind the console.''
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system was shut down for 24 minutes
while crews conducted inspections to ensure the safety of
passengers, said spokesman Mike Healy. ``We're in good shape,'' he
reported.
   Brad Thomas, a spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.,
reported that the quakes left 1,300 homes in the Concord area
without power and scattered outages in other areas.
   Mild shaking took place at the press box at Candlestick Park
where the San Francisco Giants were playing the St. Louis
Cardinals, said sportswriter Brian Martin.
   ``People who have been through them knew what it was. ... It was
business as usual,'' Martin said.
   At six-story Mount Diablo Hospital in Concord, nursing
supervisor Mary Bacon said: ``There was a sudden crack and then a
rolling that goes on and on. Some of the patients and some of the
employees were shook up and were sick to their stomachs.''
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage in the local area, a 5 considerable damage. A 7 reading is a
``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage.
