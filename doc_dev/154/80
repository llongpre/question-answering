   California Gov. George Deukmejian
said today he was ``very surprised'' by the extent of highway
damage caused by the devastating earthquake in his state and
promised a probe into why roads failed.
   Deukmejian said he had not spoken with President Bush, but that
state officials would ask Bush to declare a federal emergency for
the stricken area in and around San Francisco.
   California has a ``prudent reserve'' of $1 billion that ``we can
use and that we will use'' to help recover from Tuesday's temblor.
   Deukmejian, during a hastily called news conference at a
Frankfurt hotel, also warned of the possibility of gas line
explosions and said he had heard of ``very minor incidents'' of
looting.
   The governor, looking somber and tired, later broke off his
trade mission to West Germany and rushed back to California to
supervise rescue and reconstruction efforts.
   Jim Robinson, the governor's spokesman, said that Deukmejian had
left Frankfurt on a flight that originally was to arrive at San
Francisco airport. Robinson said that the airplane would be
diverted, most likely to Los Angeles, if it is not possible to land
in San Francisco due to the earthquake.
   He told The Associated Press that wherever Deukmejian lands, he
would immediately board a waiting U.S. military aircraft and be
taken for an inspection of the damaged areas.
   ``We will have to have the maximum use of equipment, the
necessary kind of equipment to assist in the rescue and the
restoration, and, of course, personnel,'' said Deukmejian.
   ``To the extent the federal government can make that available
either through the military or the Corp of Engineers or other
agencies, all that will be welcomed and, I'm sure, will be needed.''
   The governor said the number of ``confirmed'' deaths was
approximately 70 people.
   However, the state Office of Emergency Services said at least
200 people were crushed to death in their cars when a
half-mile-long section of the upper level of Interstate 880 in
Oakland collapsed onto the lower level. Other deaths also were
reported.
   In addition, a section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge's
top deck collapsed onto the lower deck and police said at least two
bridges in the Santa Cruz area collapsed.
   ``I had been under the impression that the highways had been
constructed to deal with any severe earthquake,'' Deukmejian told
reporters. ``And I am very surprised to see what has happened with
some of those.''
   ``I think that we are going to have to have some inquiry with
respect to that, to determine why they did not withstand a quake of
the severity of this one,'' he said.
   Deukmejian said the state was primarily responsible for ensuring
that California's highways can withstand quake damage.
   He declined to comment on damage to buildings, saying he did not
have details about which ones were affected or when they were built.
   ``There is, of course, massive destruction,'' he said. ``And
we're not going to know for a long time yet what the full extent of
it is.''
   The governor said utility companies were working ``vigorously''
to restore electricity to stricken areas.
   He said emergency teams also ``anticipate there will be gas
explosions and the like.''
   He noted that various emergency agencies had planned and
practiced for the possibility of such a disaster: ``The medical
facilities seem to be working quite well.''
   Deukmejian said the National Guard was involved in emergency
efforts, but denied what he called television reports that the
guard had been brought in specially to assist in ``quelling
rioting.''
   Jim Robinson, Deukmejian's chief of public affairs, said the
governor would leave Frankfurt later in the morning on a non-stop
Lufthansa flight for California. Robinson said that Deukmejian
would arrive in Los Angeles, if it were impossible to land in San
Francisco.
