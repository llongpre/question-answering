   Wind-whipped wildfires, some caused
by arson, destroyed more than 300 homes Wednesday in Southern
California, officials said.
   One blaze destroyed 280 homes in Santa Barbara and Goleta alone,
said Jan Bullard, spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's
Department.
   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. It
spread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said another
sheriff's spokesman, Tim Grasey.
   Fires burned dozens more homes in the hilly Los Angeles suburb
of Glendale and in El Cerrito in Riverside County, authorities said.
   The Santa Barbara County fire was labeled arson. An unidentified
incendiary device was found at the point where the fire started,
officials said.
   The fire closed southbound lanes of Highway 101, a principal
north-south California route, and burned a train trestle, forcing a
Santa Barbara-to-San Diego Amtrak train to be held in Oxnard. It
also burned a Sheriff's Department honor farm, set a fire station
ablaze and forced evacuation of the jail.
   The blaze burned in the region where former President Reagan
maintains his ranch, but it was not immediately known if the flames
threatened the property.
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Brenda Rein, who
watched from a shopping mall as fire marched down a mountain. ``The
whole sky was just orange. I looked up and saw the moon through the
smoke, kind of a werewolf moon.''
   The fire hit an area ravaged by a four-year drought, with water
reserves at their lowest in memory.
   The fire near El Cerrito, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles,
destroyed 15 homes, said California Department of Forestry
spokeswoman Jeaneen Gardner. She said no more homes were believed
threatened. The blaze there began when a U.S. Forest Service
``control burn'' to clear brush raged out of control, she said.
   Fire destroyed or damaged 32 homes in Glendale, Fire Battalion
Chief Chris Gray said. More than a dozen of the $300,000-$700,000
houses burned to their foundations.
   Arson was suspected in the Glendale fire, Gray said. ``At this
time, we have found a point of origin and a butane lighter,'' Gray
said. He said a pin had been inserted in the lighter to keep it
burning. ``That alone signals arson.''
   About 1,000 students and teachers were evacuated from Glendale
Community College in the middle of classes Wednesday as flames
moved within yards of the campus.
   An arson blaze in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, spread
over 1,500 acres to the San Bernardino County community of Sleepy
Hollow. Three homes were engulfed and 2,000 residents were
evacuated, forestry officials said.
   Peter Reyes, 29, was arrested for investigation of arson, said
Maria Sabol, a fire department spokeswoman.
   A 125-acre fire near Hemet, in Riverside County, east of Los
Angeles, injured 17 firefighters. In the Moreno Valley area, fire
destroyed three homes.
   Smaller brush fires burned in San Diego and Ventura counties and
in Cleveland National Forest in Riverside County.
   Fires were not the only problem, as the region coped with
blistering heat.
   Utilities from the coast inland to Las Vegas asked the public to
reduce electricity consumption.
   The mercury soared to 109 in downtown Los Angeles, seven degrees
over the old 1976 mark for June 27. Tuesday's 112-degree mark was
an all-time high, topping the old 110-degree record set Sept. 4,
1988.
   Temperatures topped 100 in valleys north and east of Los
Angeles. Palm Springs hit 116 by early afternoon. San Diego was a
record 91. Santa Barbara tied its record of 109.
   Heat began building in the region at the end of last week and
soon erupted into a full-blown heat wave. Heat apparently killed a
4-year-old Los Angeles boy who got into an abandoned car in the San
Fernando Valley on Tuesday.
   The heat wave was spawned by an enormous, upper-level, high
pressure over New Mexico that beat back the normal cooling
influence of the Pacific.
   ``I liken it to a huge umbrella sitting over the Southwest and
it's just baking under there, but it's not quite reaching San
Francisco,'' said National Weather Service meteorologist Art
Lessard.
