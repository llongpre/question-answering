   Those who follow the insurance industry
see opportunities for investors in the wake of the San Francisco
earthquake.
   Analysts predicted insurers will be able to reverse three years
of declining rates in California by increasing pressure on state
regulators to boost premiums as a result of the earthquake and the
estimated $4 billion in damage from Hurricane Hugo in South
Carolina.
   An increase in insurance rates could translate into greater
profitability in the long term, which in turn would boost the value
of stocks, the analysts said Wednesday.
   ``There's a perception that this could turn the cycle .... that
this could be enough to firm pricing,'' said Gloria L. Vogel, an
analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
   Insurance companies struggled Wednesday to assess the amount of
claims they're likely to pay as a result of the quake. In addition
to home damage, the insurance companies are likely to face claims
for automobile damage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business
interruption due to electrical outages, water damage and, possibly,
workers compensation.
   Some estimated that damages will reach $1 billion or more. But
industry observers said they don't expect any company to be
seriously hurt by claims arising from the quake.
   ``We don't think any company is going to have problems paying
claims,'' said Elisa Siegal, public affairs manager for the
American Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group.
   Easing the burden on insurers is the fact that most homeowners
in the San Francisco area don't have earthquake insurance on their
houses.
   The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said
that in the San Francisco area, 25 to 30 percent of the homes have
earthquake insurance. The organization estimated residential damage
at $500 million in the Bay area, with $100 million to $150 million
of that insured.
   Statewide in California, only 15 to 20 percent of all homeowners
have earthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percent
deductible and costs $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000 home,
according to industry spokesmen.
   Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will have to
pay for repairs to their houses themselves, unless their homes are
ravaged by fire. Fire damage is covered under basic homeowner
insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe
services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill.
   ``If there was fire damage, the fire is covered. That's quite
specific,'' Strawn said.
   Earthquake insurance is an emotional and politically-charged
issue in California, where many of the nation's most damaging
earthquakes have occurred.
   Under a 1985 California law, insurers are required to offer
earthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not required
to buy the coverage.
   Insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance to
commercial property owners, but the percentage of business property
with the coverage is higher than that of homeowners, industry
spokesmen said. They estimated that at least 25 percent, and
probably many more, business properties are insured.
   Because of its high costs, earthquake insurance has become a
target of the controversial Proposition 103 approved by California
voters last year. The proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback
in insurance rates. Insurers and state regulators are battling over
the rates and how they're set.
