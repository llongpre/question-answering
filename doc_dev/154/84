   An explosion and fire erupted aboard a
Panamanian tanker anchored near a city pier Sunday, seriously
burning two crewmen, the Coast Guard said.
   The fire aboard the Yamato Spirit was put out about 25 minutes
after it was reported around 1:50 p.m. by three Coast Guard boats, a
fire boat and a helicopter, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Chuck
Wullenjohn.
   The Yamato Spirit, which had 24 crewmembers on board, is owned by
Compania Naviera Rose SA of Panama, according to the Lloyd's
Register of Shipping.
   The injured crewmen, whose names were not released, were taken to
San Francisco General Hospital.
   One was in critical condition with second- and third-degree burns
on his face, hands and feet, said a nursing supervisor at San
Francisco General Hospital who refused to give her name. The other
was in serious condition with second- and third-degree burns on his
hands and feet.
   The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office is investigating the cause
of the explosion.
