   A gunman ambushed and killed a bicycle
rider, seriously injured a driver and wounded two police officers
before he was shot in a sidewalk gunbattle outside a crowded
shopping mall, police said.
   Paul Bellazain was wounded in the thigh Tuesday during a
shootout with officers near the Westlake Mall in Daly City, just
south of San Francisco, said Daly City police Detective Jim McHenry.
   One of the officers tackled Bellazain, who carried a pistol, as
he tried to flee, ending a 45-minute rampage in which a gunman in a
brown Cadillac cruised a freeway and side streets in San Francisco,
fatally shooting the bicyclist and firing at cars.
   Daly City police said Bellazain would be booked for
investigation of two counts of attempted murder. San Francisco
police said Bellazain was under investigation in connection with
the shootings here. Bellazain, 46, was in fair condition Tuesday
night at Kaiser Hospital.
   Bellazain, a veteran San Francisco transit driver, has been off
work the past five months, receiving workers' compensation because
of a hand injury.
   The shooting spree apparently began in San Francisco shortly
before 9 a.m., when officers received reports of shots fired on
Alemany Boulevard, said police spokesman Dave Ambrose.
   A short time later, James Newman was struck by a bullet that
entered his arm and lodged in his chest as he was driving on I-280
in San Francisco. Newman, 41, was in serious condition Tuesday
night at San Francisco General Hospital.
   At 9:10 a.m., police received a call that a bike rider was shot
to death at McLaren Park near the Daly City border. He was
identified by the coroner's office today as James Vaszko, 43, a
copy editor at the San Francisco Examiner.
   ``Everyone here was just shocked,'' said Larry Kramer, executive
editor of the Examiner. ``He was just one of those really nice,
intellectual type of guys. He was a sweetheart.''
   The gunman apparently continued south into Daly City, where
between 9:10 a.m. and 9:35 a.m., chiropractor Gene Martin and his
receptionist, Stephanie Ryan, were taken hostage in their office.
   ``(He) said `Get over there, doc,' and then he started to rant
and rave how the system was messing him up,'' a shaken Martin said.
   ``He had three guns when he came in and he said he was sorry he
didn't have an Uzi,'' Martin said. ``I thought I was going to die,
but he was really after the cops.''
   Bellazain gave Martin tapes containing what he said were
messages to his children proclaiming his love for them. He told the
hostages he wanted to get back at police because they were
reportedly investigating him for alleged child abuse.
   San Francisco and Daly City police said they knew of no such
investigation, but Bellazain had been under a restraining order
sought by his ex-wife, Shirley Ann Bellazain, who said he abused
her and their children during their 17-year marriage.
   The gunman let the receptionist go after she lied, saying she
was pregnant, according to Martin. He said Bellazain told him to
call police before storming out of the office to confront officers
with a volley of shots.
   ``It seemed like the shooting went on forever,'' said Alfredo
Aguirre, manager of the San Mateo County Mental Health Clinic near
the shopping center, where horrified shoppers witnessed the
gunbattle.
   Two officers, Sgt. Ralph Warren and Gary Smith, were each shot
in the arm during the gunbattle. Police said it was not clear who
shot Bellazain.
