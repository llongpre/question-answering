   About 75 earthquakes jolted Northern
California on Wednesday, the anniversary of the catastrophic Great
Quake of 1906. The temblors were aftershocks of the October quake
that killed 67, geologists said.
   There were no reports of injuries or major damage from Wednesday
morning's quakes, the largest measuring up to 5.4 on the Richter
scale. Eight others registered at least 3.3.
   The temblors on the San Andreas Fault were felt from San
Francisco to King City, 150 miles south. The San Andreas also
caused the 1906 and Oct. 17 quakes.
   ``All the memories came back to the kids _ this one
especially,'' Darrell Daniels said with his 4-year-old daughter,
Eleth, on his lap.
   ``She won't let me go.''
   The family is living in a mobile home because their home in
downtown Watsonville was condemned after the October quake.
   Wednesday's aftershocks were centered about four miles east of
Watsonville, 60 miles south of San Francisco. October's
7.1-magnitude quake caused major damage to the farming community.
   The temblors began at 6:38 a.m., shortly after a group of Great
Quake surivors gathered in San Francisco to commemorate the 1906
disaster. The strongest quake Wednesday struck at 6:54 a.m. In all,
about 75 were recorded, according to Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
   Nine quakes of 3.3 or larger were recorded, the USGS said.
   Including the latest temblors, the number of aftershocks from
the October quake registering 3.0 or more grew to 115. Of those, 38
had magnitudes of 4.0 or larger.
   The University of California-Berkeley Seismographic Station said
the strongest quake Wednesday had a preliminary reading of 5.4 on
the Richter scale. Allen Lindh of the USGS also issued a
preliminary report of 5.4.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number, for example from
magnitude 5.5 to magnitude 6.5, means that the ground motion is 10
times greater.
   ``We are considering them aftershocks. They occurred in the same
location of other aftershocks of Loma Prieta,'' said David
Oppenheimer, a Geological Survey seismologist. Loma Prieta was the
name given to October's quake.
   He said aftershocks from a magnitude-7.1 quake can continue for
two years.
   ``We figured it was all over,'' said Robert Holleson, a former
Watsonville resident who was visiting Wednesday. ``But the power's
off, the phone's dead, helicopters are flying all over. It's like
it's starting all over again.''
   Early damage reports from the Watsonville area were light, with
some dishes broken and small rockslides on Highway 152 into
Watsonville. San Francisco police said many worried residents
called, but no damage was reported.
   Ron Rutkowski, spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., said
about 11,000 customers in the Watsonville and Santa Cruz area lost
power. All service was restored by noon.
   Wednesday marked the 84th anniversary of the 1906 quake, which
struck at 5:13 a.m. on April 18. Although the Richter scale didn't
exist then, it was later determined that the quake's magnitude was
8.3.
   For decades it was believed that about 700 people died in the
1906 earthquake. But in recent years, research by San Francisco
City Archivist Gladys Hansen documented at least 2,500 deaths, and
she has said the real toll may be much higher.
   About 150 people gathered Wednesday at Lotta's Fountain in
downtown San Francisco by 5:13 a.m. Some were heading to another
commemoration when the first tremor occurred.
   ``One or two of the survivors commented that it didn't faze them
at all as they had experienced THE big one,'' said organizer Taren
Sapienza.
   The October quake caused more than $7 billion in damage and
rattled residents who used to shrug off small temblors. That quake
caused a double-deck section of Interstate 880 in Oakland to
collapse, killing 42 people. Parts of three freeways that were
damaged remain closed.
   On Tuesday, exactly six months after the quake, more than 100
people mingled at an earthquake-preparedness rally at San
Francisco's Justin Herman Plaza, a few yards from the ruined
Embarcadero Freeway.
   Around the plaza, people manned display tables, where pamphlets
and disaster checklists were handed out. Pictures of the October
earthquake destruction also were on review.
   At Watsonville's mobile home park, Jimmie Henson said even
though Wednesday's quakes were smaller than October's, they were
more destructive for her. The tremors caused cracks in the walls of
her home and broke dishes and other small objects.
   ``I'm more upset today than I was from the big one _ much
more,'' she said.
