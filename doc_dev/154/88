<TEXT>     The San Carlos Flight Center, a company that rents space to aircraft, said
three partners regularly flew the plane. It had been based at San Carlos
Airport for at least a year.;    The plane left Hayward Air Terminal at 8:50
a.m., headed to the Peninsula airport. Five minutes later and two miles from
the San Mateo Bridge Toll Plaza, Kueck called in a routine position report to
the San Carlos Airport tower and said he expected to arrive in five minutes.; 
  When the plane failed to land, Federal Aviation Administration officials at
San Francisco International Airport alerted the Coast Guard at 9:30 a.m. to
look for the missing Cessna 172.;    "It wasn't issued as a distress call but
as an overdue report," said Bryan Bender, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman.;    A
Coast Guard helicopter crew, a 41-foot search-and-rescue ship and a 20-foot
inflatable boat began the search about 9:40 a.m. After circling the area
around the San Mateo Bridge for almost an hour, the search party spotted the
wing of the aircraft, which was under six feet of water near the Coyote Hills
Slough.;    At 11:17 a.m., divers from the San Francisco Fire Department
pulled out the badly injured Kueck, who had been trapped inside the plane.;   
A helicopter lowered a rescue boat and airlifted Kueck to an ambulance, where
paramedics administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation but failed to revive
him.;    Kueck was pronounced dead at 12:02 p.m. at St. Rose Hospital in
Hayward.;    Divers continued searching the murky waters and the cabin of the
four-seat plane for more bodies, but none was found. They called off the
search about 12:30 p.m., when it was determined that Kueck had been flying
alone.;    Hayward police arrived shortly afterward to guard the wreckage,
which is being inspected by the National Transportation Safety Board.
Inspectors still had not determined by late Tuesday why the plane crashed.;   
"We have not yet reviewed the audiotapes, but everything appeared to be normal
(before the plane went down)," said Bob Ensten, chief air traffic controller
at the San Carlos air tower.  </TEXT>
