   An earthquake that broke windows and
contributed to one death in the San Francisco Bay area could herald
even stronger temblors along the San Andreas fault, scientists say.
   ``The stress is building up in the earth and we're going to
start getting large earthquakes,'' said Andy Michael, a
geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. ``It
should serve as a reminder to prepare.''
   The quake rolled for 10 seconds, shaking buildings and awakening
residents but causing only minor damage, authorities said.
   ``I thought all my windows were going to break,'' said Margaret
Dunlap of San Francisco. ``My whole bed was shaking.''
   It struck at 1:13 a.m. about 50 miles south of San Francisco and
had a magnitude of 5.2 on the Richter scale, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey. It was centered on the San Andreas fault about
15 miles south of San Jose.
   State earthquake experts and the California Office of Emergency
Services issued a warning of increased risk and said another quake
as high as 6.2 on the Richter scale could strike San Francisco in
the next five days.
   ``It certainly shows us the fault is becoming more active,''
said Michael, who added that the quake was the largest in the area
since 1969.
   Geologists said the chances of a bigger quake in the same spot
diminished with each passing hour, however.
   The quake occurred as state and federal emergency services
officials prepared to conduct a two-day test of their response to a
catastrophic earthquake.
   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, was in
Sacramento to attend the first day of the test. When she woke up at
5:30 a.m. and saw coverage of the actual earthquake on television,
she thought it was part of the exercise.
   ``I thought, `Gee, this is pretty interesting. They have the
simulation on television already,''' Quayle said.
   In Los Gatos, where the quake was centered, police reported that
19-year-old Matthew James Bignall jumped from his bedroom window
after apparently being startled awake by the earthquake.
   Bignall died of multiple traumatic injuries, according to a
spokeswoman with the Santa Clara County coroner's office. His
half-brother said Bignall had never experienced an earthquake.
   ``My brother was a sound sleeper,'' said Ronald Burger, who
shared the apartment with Bignall. ``And I think the motion of the
quake seemed so violent and disorienting that he just leaped out
the window. He felt he had to get out, and I don't think he knew
what he was doing.''
   Residents reported some broken windows and items falling off
shelves but no major problems, a Los Gatos police dispatcher said.
Damage was confined mostly to Santa Clara and northern Santa Cruz
counties, according to the state Office of Emergency Services in
Sacramento.
   The quake was felt as far away as San Luis Obispo, about 230
miles south of San Francisco. Residents of Sonoma County, 60 miles
to the north, also felt the temblor, according to the state agency.
   A moderate aftershock measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale struck
at 1:44 a.m., followed by a second, stronger aftershock that
measured 4.5 at 8:53 a.m., the USGS said.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of ground motion
recorded on a seismograph. Each increase of one number means a
tenfold increase in ground motion.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the scale.
