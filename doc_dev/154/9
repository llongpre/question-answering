   A moderate earthquake rattled Southern California a day after
snow and sleet blanketed the fire-blackened region, while
hurricane-force winds pounded Northern California, cutting power to
hundreds of thousands and leading to three children's deaths.
   The winds, clocked at up to 102 mph, died down Thursday night,
shortly before the temblor hit 500 miles to the southeast in a state
suffering in recent weeks from an attack of nature's worst elements.
   The winds fanned fires, uprooted trees and overturned trucks.
More than 575,000 Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. customers lost power
Wednesday night and Thursday, said utility spokeswoman Jan Stewart.
By late Thursday, 22,000 remained without electricity. The wind also
knocked out power to more than 14,000 people in Southern California.
   Two people died as dozens of cars crashed Thursday in 10
accidents along ice-slick Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass 55 miles
east of Los Angeles, said Highway Patrol spokesman John Savage.
   ``One of the problems is here we don't have the snow equipment to
take care of this _ it doesn't happen here,'' said Highway Patrol
Officer Frank Stricker.
   Snow up to 7 inches deep closed lanes of Interstate 5 over Tejon
Pass north of Los Angeles, California's main north-south route, and
coastal Highway 101 near San Luis Obispo about 150 miles north of
the city.
   Thousands of motorists were stranded, travel elsewhere was
difficult and some schools in San Luis Obispo County were closed,
officials said.
   Weather forecasters predicted much of the same through the
weekend, saying 1 to 2 feet of snow was possible in southern
mountain ranges.
   The earthquake late Thursday rattled windows and knocked wall
hangings askew from Los Angeles to Palm Springs 110 miles to the
east. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries.
   The quake registered a moderate 4.8 on the Richter scale and was
centered 13 miles northwest of Palm Springs, said Hall Daly, a
spokesman for California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   Just a week earlier the Los Angeles Basin was swept by warm,
fierce Santa Ana winds. Wind-fanned fires burned dozens of homes in
two suburbs Dec. 8 and blackened 3,000 acres of brushy terrain the
next day.
   In northern Utah, canyon winds gusting to 115 mph knocked out
power to 50,000 people Wednesday and Thursday, and 3,000 remained
without power late Thursday, said Utah Power &amp; Light spokesman Dave
Mead.
   Twenty-four schools and the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden
closed. At least five tractor-trailer rigs were blown over in Davis
County near Great Salt Lake and mail delivery in northern Utah was
delayed or halted, officials said.
   In Northern California, power outages led to two deadly
candle-sparked fires, officials said. In Berkeley, 3-year-old Oli
Asghar died Thursday and his family was left homeless.
   In Pittsburg, about 30 miles to the north, 6-year-old Mounkoun
Lee died late Wednesday of smoke inhalation after he was trapped
inside his burning home. His 5-year-old sister, Angela, died at
Children's Hospital on Thursday night.
   It caught fire after her parents neglected to extinguish a candle
next to a bed they were using for light when wind knocked out power,
officials said.
   In Sonoma County north of San Francisco Bay, ``we've had lots of
trees knocked down, power outages and phone problems,'' said Dan
Nicholas of county Emergency Services. ``Some homes have been
damaged to the point where the people had to be evacuated and put up
in motels overnight.''
   On the bay's long waterfront, the winds sent waves up to 10 feet
high slamming into seawalls and sank a 60-foot floating dock at San
Francisco's Pier 43. Piles of metal and other debris were left on
streets.
   A tugboat sank in Richardson Bay near Sausalito, two boats sank
at a China Basin dock just south of downtown San Francisco, and the
Coast Guard kept busy retrieving small boats torn from their
moorings, officials said. Famed attorney Melvin Belli's 110-foot
yacht, Adequate Award, was damaged when another boat dragging its
anchor slammed into his in Richardson Bay.
   Much bigger craft had problems as well. The aircraft carrier USS
Carl Vinson and its 3,000-man crew,wrapping up a six-month tour, had
to delay a holiday port call until today, said Petty Officer Roger
Turner.
   The wind blew out store windows in Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward,
and shattered glass blocked major roadways.
   Several trucks along a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 580
southeast of San Francisco were toppled, the Highway Patrol said.
   A downed power line in Sonoma County's geysers area sparked a
fire that burned 250 acres, but threatened no homes. In Tuolumne
County near the Nevada border, a controlled-burn fire flared and
blackened 100 acres. Several small fires were reported in the
Stanislaus National Forest.
   The winds also delayed flights and diverted air traffic to and
from San Francisco International Airport and caused elevators to
malfunction in the city.
