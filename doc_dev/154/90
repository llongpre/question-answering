   California leads the nation and much of the
world in construction rules for earthquake safety but future quakes
will kill many people unless more is done to make buildings and
bridges tougher, experts say.
   Authorities also say that forecast does not apply to shaky
California alone. Many parts of the United States have earthquake
potential and could learn lessons from last Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude
jolt in Northern California.
   ``The lesson of this quake is that we have the technology to
radically reduce death, injury and damage in case of an earthquake.
Let's get on with using it,'' said state Sen. Don Rogers of
Bakersfield, the only geologist in California's Legislature.
   Unreinforced brick and brittle concrete structures need
strengthening, and tax incentives should be given to foster design
of new buildings with shock absorbers in foundations, quake-damping
devices in walls, and automatic gas-shutoff valves to prevent
fires, Rogers said.
   Tuesday's San Francisco Bay area quake claimed scores of lives,
many in the collapse of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland,
others in toppled buildings. Yet the overwhelming majority of
structures stood.
   In contrast, the quake in Armenia last Dec. 7, which also
measured 6.9 on the Richter scale of ground motion, killed many of
its 25,000 victims in collapsed apartments built with unreinforced
masonry walls and precast concrete floor slabs.
   Armenian cities were also close to the fault, while last week's
epicenter was in a rural area 50 miles from San Francisco and
Oakland. Armenia lacks timber; many U.S. homes are built with
quake-resistant wood frames.
   Nevertheless, ``we would have experienced a tremendous amount of
devastation without the building codes and standards we have in
California,'' said State Architect Michael J. Bocchicchio. ``The
number of lives lost and the amount of damage would have approached
some quakes in other parts of the world.''
   But Tuesday's quake ``was not the ultimate test; we should not
rest on our laurels,'' he said, warning of deadly hazard from
California's thousands of unreinforced brick buildings and
``soft-story'' concrete buildings with stiff upper levels atop
inflexible frames.
   A 1988 U.S. Geological Survey study reported that Southern
California is 60 percent likely to be rocked by a magnitude-7.5 to
8 ``big one'' within 30 years, while the Bay area faces 50-50 odds
of a magnitude-7 quake, possibly on the Hayward Fault beneath
Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward.
   The USGS said a repeat of San Francisco's 8.3-magnitude 1906
quake is only 10 percent likely within 30 years, but a 1980 federal
report said it could claim 11,000 lives. The report said the
Southern California quake could kill 14,000 people; a magnitude-7.4
Hayward Fault jolt might kill 7,000.
   ``Unless we take the threat seriously, we could have an
appalling death toll,'' said Richard Eisner, director of the
Oakland-based Bay Area Regional Earthquake Preparedness Project.
   Past quakes did spur improvements.
   The 1933 magnitude-6.3 Long Beach quake killed 115 people, and
many schools collapsed after students went home. Laws soon required
seismic resistance in new buildings, and old school buildings were
strengthened.
   Los Angeles' Sylmar quake of 1971, with a magnitude of 6.4,
toppled freeway overpasses and killed at least 58 people, many in a
collapsed hospital. The temblor prompted stringent hospital
construction standards, a 1976 revamp of model building codes, and
the $58-million first phase of a program to strengthen freeway
bridges.
   A later phase, not yet started, would have attempted to
strengthen columns that gave way during the Nimitz collapse.
   Much damage from Tuesday's quake wasn't surprising, including
collapse of old unreinforced brick buildings, destruction of homes
sitting on soft fill, and fires from natural gas leaks.
   Seismic disaster threatens much of the nation. Quakes are most
frequent in Alaska and California, but great earthquakes rocked New
Madrid, Mo., in 1811-12, and the Pacific Northwest in prehistoric
times. The East Coast has sustained strong jolts.
