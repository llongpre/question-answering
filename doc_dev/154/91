   The powerful earthquake that jolted the San
Francisco Bay area forced a holiday on tens of thousands of people,
who poured into the rubble-littered streets to gawk at nature's
might.
   Amid the balmy weather that encouraged throngs clad mostly in
shorts and T-shirts, there were scenes of devastation and others _
like the soup line of 1,000 outside Glide Memorial Church in the
seedy Tenderloin district _ emblematic of more permanent
misfortunes.
   The disaster brought out the spectator in many, but others
pitched in to help the homeless and distraught.
   ``This is an incredible coming together; an act of the brotherly
love that San Franciscans were famous for in the '60s,''
self-described ``ex-hippie'' Chuck Rosen said as he helped people
clear rubble from a collapsed building.
   The dawn of a flaming sun, colored through wisps of fog in the
hills east of San Francisco, painted streets in rose tones as
residents and hundreds of stranded visitors awoke a day after the
quake, unsure of what awaited them.
   Thousands arose from a night in emergency shelters, hundreds
more from makeshift tents in city parks and rural lots. Most had
spent more than 12 hours without heat or light.
   But the vast majority of the region's 6 million residents made
it through the night in largely undisturbed comfort. As they
mingled on the streets by the hundreds in cities ranging from the
Pacific coastal community of Santa Cruz to Oakland, they became a
portrait of contrasts.
   In San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, joggers huffed in the
bright high-noon sun. Temperatures reached the high 70s by late
afternoon. A couple walked their two dogs. A lone man sunbathed on
a knoll near the towering band shell.
   While sprinklers in the well-to-do Marina district saturated
expansive, manicured lawns, many residents of collapsed sections of
the neighborhood were forced into a Red Cross shelter, where they
quickly ran out of water. A Mendocino water company donated a
truckload of bottled water.
   The traditional daily crowd of tattered homeless people at
Tenderloin churches was swelled by hundreds of elderly hotel
dwellers and Southeast Asian refugee families. They came to the
church hoping to eat their first meal since the quake.
   The Marina, at the northern end of the city inside the Golden
Gate, is renowned for its narrow, curving streets, with such names
as Alhambra, Cervantes and Mallorca. The streets are lined with
neat, handsome homes and apartments, most finished with
light-colored stucco and many with tile roofs.
   But the area, built on fill land, was the hardest hit of San
Francisco's neighborhoods.
   On Wednesday, it contained scenes like this: Next to the
crumpled, charred rubble of a three-story apartment complex, an
elderly woman gingerly dusted a delicate crystal lamp.
   A helicopter tour of the Bay Area beginning at daybreak revealed
billowing smoke pouring from a block of the Marina nearly flattened
by a fire that broke out after the quake. Two joggers ran by,
trying to step over firehoses without breaking stride.
   The grand sandstone structure of the Palace of Fine Arts, built
for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, was draped in
smoke from the devastated buildings two blocks away. The
neighborhood of bungalows and Victorians looked as if a giant
invading creature had taken two steps and then turned back.
   The silver strand of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
gracefully cut through the foggy haze, marred only by lines of
orange hazard cones blocking traffic.
   A collapsed 50-foot section of the upper level looked like
nothing more than one pasteboard in a fallen house of cards. On
either side of the bridge, the green-and-yellow pennants of the
Oakland Athletics and the black-and-orange of the San Francisco
Giants flapped at each other in the light morning breeze, with no
motorists to cheer them on.
   On the Oakland side of the bridge, a collapsed section of
Interstate 880 looked like it had melted in a scorching sun. On the
nearby beaches of Alameda, scores of sun bathers took advantage of
canceled school or work.
   At Santa Cruz, the historic Boardwalk amusement park was
spotless but without visitors, while hundreds of people stood in
block-long lines at the few supermarkets open to the public in a
city largely devoid of power and potable water.
