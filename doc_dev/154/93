A severe earthquake in Los Angeles yesterday left at least 10 people dead
and caused widespread damage and disruption to transport and communications.
The quake, which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale, caused about 100 fires
in and around the city as gas pipes ruptured.
In Sylmar in the San Fernando valley, where an estimated 70 homes were
destroyed, aerial television photographs showed whole streets in flames. In
San Fernando suburb, dozens of cars lining the streets exploded from the
intense heat of gas fires. At least a half dozen vehicles were burning on
one street.
Reports said that 50 buildings in Hollywood were also destroyed and the
quake caused many houses - including several million-dollar homes - to slide
off their foundations. Many buildings were seriously damaged, including two
hospitals, which have been closed. Other hospitals said they were 'inundated
with walking wounded'.
In the suburban town of Northridge, the epicentre of the quake north-west of
central Los Angeles, emergency workers struggled to free residents of a
three-storey apartment complex that partly collapsed. The multi-storey park
at the town's shopping centre collapsed and people were feared trapped
inside.
The earthquake struck at 4.31am Pacific Standard Time, according to the US
Geological Service. Had it struck two hours later, in the rush hour,
fatalities would probably have been much higher, officials said. Yesterday's
Martin Luther King holiday also meant that many businesses planned to stay
closed, reducing traffic.
Nonetheless the death toll was expected to increase through the day as
rescue workers searched collapsed buildings. Several raised freeways to the
north and west of the city collapsed. The Santa Monica freeway, the busiest
in the US, carrying more than 370,000 vehicles daily, was severely damaged
in several places.
Most of the main arteries to and through the San Fernando Valley, a suburban
expanse of about 3m residents, were badly damaged. Police said the quake
threw cars from elevated freeways on to streets below.
The stark pictures of the pancaked roadways in Los Angeles are reminiscent
of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter
scale, and in which more than 50 people died. Repairs and reinforcements to
the San Francisco freeway system are still in progress, four years later,
and are not expected to be completed for at least another two years. Los
Angeles, the US's second-biggest city, faces serious traffic problems for
years ahead, structural engineers predicted.
The city's airports, which were closed in the immediate aftermath of the
earthquake, reopened by mid morning and United Airlines announced that it
was resuming service to the city. However, delays were exacerbated by
numerous aftershocks, including two measuring over 5 on the Richter scale.
Telephone services to the entire Los Angeles area were limited to emergency
services. Officials called on residents to stay off the roads, warning of
severe danger. Most of Los Angeles was without electricity and there were
power cuts throughout California.
Mr Richard Riordan, the city's mayor, declared a local emergency an hour
after the earthquake, freeing local emergency services to respond without
regard for costs. President Bill Clinton and California governor Pete Wilson
also offered emergency support to the city.
