<LEADPARA>  PERCHED buoyantly astride his motorbike, Gary Palmer roars down Highway 101 in
his daily runs from San Francisco to the South Bay, logging 25,000 miles a
year.;   Palmer is part of a dynamic new breed of mobile dancer-choreographer
who doesn't fit the old stereotype of the fragile poet-dancer.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The commute, from his home in San Francisco to teaching posts in San Jose,
is not without its risks. "I once had a motorcycle accident four hours before
a performance," says Palmer with an insouciant shrug. "I do it rain or shine.
I love it -- the acceleration, the moving through space . . .";   His
evening-length piece, "Dark Fires," being performed in a five-day run starting
tonight at San Francisco's Theater Artaud, is as iconoclastic as the
choreographer himself. At its first showing in mid-May, "Dark Fires" drew a
lot of comment about its references to relationships, couples and
inclusion-exclusion.;   It will be performed by the Gary Palmer Dance Company,
currently in its 10th year -- which, in the world of West Coast modern dance,
amounts virtually to a dynasty.;   Heading south; What makes Palmer and his
work doubly interesting right now is his intention to move his residence to
the South Bay in the coming months. Living here promises to bring the
community more than just the ballet classes Palmer already teaches at the De
Anza and San Jose City colleges; it promises to liven up the
professional-level contemporary-dance scene here, with performances under his
guidance a possibility.;   "It makes sense to be there; the dance potential is
great," Palmer said after a recent San Francisco rehearsal. "I like the South
Bay a lot, and I love the climate.";   Santa Clara County and San Jose have
dropped the ball by not nurturing more contemporary dance performances and
companies in an area now dominated by ballet.;   Palmer's troupe is a case in
point. Officially a San Francisco company, it gets funding from the city's
hotel tax, and performs there as well. But nearly 90 percent of its board
members come from the South Bay, and the majority of the audiences for Palmer
programs at Theater Artaud come from the South Bay as well, according to
ticket-order statistics.;   Impressive company;   That may change. "Our board
is very interested in performing in the South Bay, perhaps as early as next
spring," said Palmer.;   The company and its repertory have impressed critics
and audiences in recent years, though Palmer's annual "Men Dancing" series
(also at Theater Artaud, one week after "Dark Waters") has been criticized for
catering too parochially to the gay community.;   At De Anza College, where
Palmer has taught for 12 years, Dean of Creative Arts Judith Espinola praises
his meticulousness, professionalism and flair in teaching novices and devotees
alike.;   "He's one of our faithful, long-term, part-time faculty, on whom we
depend a great deal," said Espinola. "He really brings an expertise" to both
ballet and modern dance.;   Ballet is a recurrent thread with Palmer. All his
company dancers take ballet class. "My company's modern -- I call it
contemporary -- but they have classical sensibilities.";   Brought up in
Cooperstown, N.Y., Palmer moved to the Bay Area in 1975. He started his
company in 1981. To date, he has created 35 dances for it. The ensemble has
also toured Europe.;   "Dark Fires" is Palmer's longest and "most democratic"
piece, set for three men and three women. The press release (which sets Palmer
squirming) calls it "an expose of romance." He prefers to call it a piece on
the expressive nature of the individual.;   "Possibly it's dealing with
romance, especially in the second part," he says. "But what interested me was
how it leads to the potential of conflict, even self-destruction.";   The set
for "Dark Fires" includes French doors that are used in the dance to
communicate phases of separation. There is also a nude scene, only partly
disguised.;   The title of the work is taken from Robert Bly's poem "Looking
Into a Face," suggesting the juxtaposition of opposite images.;   Little
leeway for injury; With only six dancers and no backup performers, the company
flirts with danger. But Palmer is unperturbed about the possibility that an
injury or illness could dampen the intensity of five performances in five
days.;   "Adrenaline is better than aspirin," he said.;   Collaborating with
Palmer on the work is Marc Ream, a composer best known for scores at George
Coates Performance Works, which have earned him four Bay Area Theater Critics
awards for music. The largely electronic score calls for live saxophone and
drums, parts that will be entirely improvised each night.;   When asked what
it takes to run his own company, Palmer said, "A lot of work, a lot of
determination, a lot of stubbornness -- and also a few 60- to 70-hour weeks."
He smiled.;   Somehow it sounded less like work and more like fun, the way he
told it.; Gary Palmer Dance Company; "Dark Fires"; Where: Theater Artaud, 450
