1906 earthquake. The tremor's death toll was estimated at 700.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  A moment of silence gave way to a flood of memories Thursday as a small group
of survivors of the 1906 earthquake gathered to mark the 85th anniversary of
the Great Quake and fire.;    "All I remember is big rocks on the street,"
said Grace Pietsch, 89. "I had gotten separated from my family. I never found
any of my family. Some other people took me home and they reared me."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Pietsch, whose parents died before the quake, lost the grandfather who was
rearing her. She recalls shattered glass and feeling disoriented as she
searched for her only relative before being taken home by family friends.;   
Survivors beamed at the crowd during a moment of silence at 5:13 a.m. to mark
the moment the quake struck, then clapped and patted one another on the
shoulder as sirens rang out. The oldest, at 105, did not attend the ceremony.;
   "For a few moments a year, we're celebrities," said Bill Goodman, 91.;   
Bloody Marys flowed and an Enrico Caruso "sound-a-like" serenaded survivors
during the annual ceremony at Lotta's Fountain, which provided water during
the quake.;    When the quake hit, Caruso, the famed tenor, fled the Palace
Hotel wearing only a towel. Ron Fahy, a San Francisco plumbing contractor who
won the sound-a-like contest, appeared at the ceremony wearing a bathrobe
after spending the night in the recently reopened Palace Hotel.;    Stories
told by the survivors remind current residents that the devastating Loma
Prieta earthquake 18 months ago could have been much worse.;    An estimated
700 people died and some 28,000 buildings were destroyed by the Great Quake
and subsequent fire in the city that had become the financial capital of the
West Coast.;    "That was a real hard one. Don't ever think your '89 was bad,"
said Cora Luchetti, 91.;    Luchetti was 6 years old when she lost her father
during the quake. She remembers watching the city burn from a park on Steiner
Street and waiting for her father to return from the fruit market where he was
buying produce for his store when the quake hit.;    "My mother kept waiting
for him to come home. When she saw the wagon come with another man driving,
she knew my father was killed," said Lucchetti, rolling a pink carnation in
her gloved hands.;    In 1906, flames from ruptured gas lines and other
sources spread quickly after the quake. Firefighters were virtually helpless
because of damage to water mains, and buildings were dynamited to check the
spreading flames.;    Most downtown buildings, including the Palace and
several other grand hotels, were destroyed or badly damaged. But within 10
years, the city had been rebuilt.;    The Richter scale had not been invented
to measure the strength of earthquakes when the 1906 temblor struck, but
researchers estimate it would have been magnitude 8.3. The Loma Prieta
earthquake measured 7.1.;    That quake, centered about 50 miles south of San
Francisco, killed 67 people, including 42 in the collapse of an elevated
freeway across the bay in Oakland.  </TEXT>
