   SAN FRANCISCO -- Insurance company losses from the
devastating blaze in Oakland, Calif., could reach $1.5
billion, making it one of the costliest fires of the past
century.
   More than 2,700 dwelling units were destroyed, including
at least 1,800 single-family homes in pricey hillside
communities, and 19 people were confirmed dead, while 49
people were still reported missing, government officials say.
If the property damage parallels that of last summer's arson
fire in Santa Barbara, Calif., which averaged $500,000 per
house, insurers will easily pay out more than $1 billion.

   Total damage and various costs arising from the blaze,
including lost tax revenue and firefighting charges, could
amount to a higher figure. Some people, including Oakland
Mayor Elihu Harris, have guessed that such losses could go as
high as $5 billion.
   "That was just a number that was thrown out. We are all
speculating," said Deborah Campbell, Mr. Harris's press
secretary.
   The fire resulting from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake
caused approximately $5 billion of damage in today's dollars.
The loss from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was something
under $2 billion. By way of comparison, insurers paid $960
million following the 1989 San Francisco area earthquake, and
$234 million after the Santa Barbara fire.
   Though a reliable estimate of claims won't be available
for another 24 hours, James Welsh, a claim consultant with
American Insurance Services Group, an industry trade
association based in Rahway, N.J., said that the $1.5 billion
estimate "may not be that far off" from the exposure
insurance companies face.
   But he said damage to uninsured property other than homes
and automobiles, plus overtime pay for firefighters and other
personnel, may be included in the $1.5 billion figure. Still,
that amount may not take into account smoke-related damage to
property that escaped the flames. Further, temporary lodging
for some 5,000 people who lost their homes will be costly,
Mr. Welsh said.
   Losses from the area's 1989 earthquake were lower than at
first anticipated because many property owners did not carry
earthquake insurance and most coverage carries a high
deductible.
