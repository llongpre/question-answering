   Christian Lacroix, maintaining his reputation as a
young creator, brought out a collection of fun, fantasy, lace and
furs on the first day of haute couture showings for next winter.
   As Paris sweltered under a rare heatwave, top couturiers on
Sunday unveiled their luxurious, befurred and feathered models for
cooler weather.
   Lacroix's pouf skirt finally ran out of steam. But he's kept a
taste for beautiful, opulent fabrics and top-heavy outfits full of
quirky, funny ideas.
   He's a man who takes chances with these expensive fabrics and he
usually wins, though not always. The applause after the show was
tepid.
   Bernard Arnault, head of the Agache financial consortium backing
Lacroix, waffled when asked if the eccentric, creative designer is
still a hot money-maker. ``His clothes are beautiful. That's all
that counts,'' he said.
   Lacroix's clothes with the draped fichu shoulder, the big hoods
or head scarves and collars over tiny skirts are great on the
runway, but perhaps not at every party, no matter how splashy.
   He used a lot of browns, dolling up pinstriped jackets with
draped satin fronts and sable cuffs, sometimes teamed with a
mole-colored velvet skirt. Mixing up textures with abandon, he put
a tiny lame ``damasked'' bolero over a trapeze minidress in shades
of mustard and burgundy, with a quilted velvet panel on the skirt.
   Some of the luxury fantasy was hilarious, till one tried to tote
up the cost of the enormous sable parka topping chocolate shorts
with braided silk cornrows flipping over them like a reggae singer
gone wild _ a mini-fantasy well over $30,000.
   Lacroix's violet jersey dress was a soothing contrast to all the
show-off fabrics. His little shortie flared coats in faille and
satin were wearable. There were wonderful moments like the long,
slinky carmine velvet coat with huge sparkling buttons worn over
slimming pants embroidered with stars.
   The brown and khaki silks were always topped up with lively
shades of coral, saffron, turquoise or gold.
   For evening, Lacroix's hand-painted pink and green tulle
ballerina fantasies and jeweled tunics looked like a Midsummer
Night's Dream of luxury. Other ballerina numbers were in rich red
velvet and black, always sparkling with touches of gold.
   The dazzling jeweled boleros and jackets looked like a treasure
trove of Ali Baba's Cave.
   And after Christian discovered his mom's lace-edged satin
slip-dress, his versions of lace for the runway simply took off in
a froth of glory.
   The heavy guipure effects, the lame-embroidered dresses in
khaki, cream and gold, the damasked and brocade dresses with
pheasant or ostrich-feather trim harked back to the best of the
negligee looks in the Twenties and Thirties. But things were always
a bit on the wild side _ a la Christian Lacroix.
   Japanese couturiere Hanae Mori, celebrating 35 years in the
fashion business and a new shop in Paris, showed beautifully
crafted clothes with more workmanship than fantasy.
   Her fit and cut are always impeccable, and the swirling
red-black-green harlequin coat over a pine green short sheath is
anything but stodgy. Her full-skirted grey flannel suits with black
velvet decor and the Mori trademark butterfly pins should please
her faithful regulars.
   Her true couture details _ like satin basketweaving basque
waists in suits _ testified to her craftsmanship. She was lavish
with fancy fabrics, but her lame-flecked or sequin-embroidered lace
numbers were demure rather than daring.
   The dresses that made one want to weep with joy were the chiffon
prints in Mori's ``old'' style _ the feather-light chiffon print
landscapes with the most delicate Japanese prints of flowers, trees
and birds.
   Torrente's forte is showbiz, and she wisely showed plenty of
spangled numbers to look great onstage or at a gala dinner.
   Her three full, long cashmere wraparound coats in emerald,
cardinal and rust looked light, easy and warm. Her saffron fitted
spencer jacket over an aubergine long, slinky skirt is a good way
of easing into evening.
   And she went all out for late-day glitz: a few jet embroidered
dresses had discreet trains. Colorful patchwork jackets had fur or
ostrich-feather cuffs. The all-sequined slink would be fine for
midnight at Las Vegas. Easier to wear would be the tuxedos with big
pearl pink satin lapels.
