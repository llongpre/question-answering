   The Wildlife Ministry has fired 10 game
wardens and rangers and suspended 33 others in a campaign to stop
elephant poaching, newspapers reported Friday.
   Wild game hunting is banned in Kenya, but poachers kill
elephants for their valuable ivory tusks and are decimating Kenya's
elephant herds.
   Ivory tusks sell for $82 a pound. Much of the ivory smuggled
from Kenya ends up in the Far East, where it is carved into jewelry
and figurines.
   ``If they have broken the law, they will be prosecLeakey, assistant
minister for tourism and wildlife, told
Parliament on Thursday. Leakey's comments were reportuted,'' Philip
ed by Kenya's
three English-language newspapers, The Standard, the Daily Nation
and the Kenya Times.
   He said the 10 rangers and game wardens dismissed had been
working in Tsavo, Masai Mara and Amboseli national parks.
Twenty-nine game wardens and four rangers also have been
interdicted pending further investigations, said Leakey.
   ``We have sacked them and investigations are ongoing,'' he said.
``Every effort will be made to bring these people to justice.''
   It was unclear whether the 43 rangers and game wardens affected
by the move included the 33 officers of different ranks the
ministry suspended in September.
   Leakey said the ministry planned to intensify training programs
for wildlife officers in K come home, to bring his wife and two children
back to their own country, but his professional achievements and
aspirations had reached too high. So he set out to fulfill a new
dream: a world-class heart hospital in India. Now it has become a
reality. ``It's a passion for me to come back and train others,''
he says.

   CLEVELAND _ For the past few months, the Ohio Lottery has been
flashing an ad on the scoreboard of Cleveland Stadium reminding
fans that a $3 million lottery jackpot isn't ``chicken feed'' or
``chopped liver.'' The explosion in the size of lottery jackpots
may hinder play around the country on games with relatively smaller
prizes, says a trade magazine publisher: ``Why play when it's $10
million if it could be $50 million?''

   HOLLIDAYSBURG, Pa. _ Children around the world have enjoyed
playing with springy Slinkies for 43 years, but the 70-year-old

and games. Betty James took control of the business in 1960, when
her husband, who invented Slinky, lost interest and left her and
six children to join what she called a religious cult in Bolivia.
