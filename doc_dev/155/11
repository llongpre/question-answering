   This winter's tale of haute couture as seen last
week was a fabulous fantasy, with designers spinning out their
dreams in rich confections for the elite, or just for show.
   Short to shorter is the norm in daytime lengths, though houses
like Saint Laurent and Givenchy generally kept skirts wearably just
above the knee.
   And was enough gold and jeweled embroidery around to boost many
prices into the stratosphere.
   But dream on ... and take note of silhouettes, fabrics and
color, often more modestly available in ready-to-wear. There is a
rainbow of possibilities, with each designer pushing his own
outlines and themes.
   The fashion world was pleased to see Claude Montana win the
coveted Golden Thimble award for his Lanvin collection, following
his disappointing debut there last January.
   His pyramid shortie coats and babydoll jackets, his lean pants
or skirt suits, his great use of luxury fabrics from cashmere to
faille taffeta showed Montana's mastery of his art, so often
praised before in his own luxury ready-to-wear line.
   The pyramid shape or other shortie-coat looks cropped up all
over the place. Saint Laurent's more sober versions have deep, full
dolmen sleeves.
   Shoulders are mainly rounded, even sloped. The only hold-outs
for important padding are Saint Laurent and Givenchy.
   Suits are body-skimming but not so tight as a few seasons ago,
with great long jackets and some nice flyaway boleros.
   Generally the daytime fabrics were smooth, light and soft in
cashmeres or broadcloth or tweedy, with flecked or herringbones,
some bold black and red plaids _ great at Valentino, for example.
Python is a new favorite for trim at Givenchy, for a whole jacket
or more at Saint Laurent.
   Daytime colors included fall stand-bys _ siena, gray, burnt
orange, ochre, pine and brick, plus some white and all the browns
from caramel to chocolate. Dior's Gianfranco Ferre did
extraordinary things with mixes of blue shades from plum to
ultramarine or indigo.
   In both daytime and late-day wear, Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel
pleased those who would like to look young and kittenish with minis
over fancy thigh boots _ from hot satin to jeweled or embroidered
suede.
   Lagerfeld's boots were among the most flamboyant in a
newly-revived trend for long, lean and high or flat-heeled boots.
   He seems torn between the 1960s ingenue look and the l8th
century of Marie-Antoinette, topping dressy, skimpy minis with big
satin and taffeta embroidered pannier skirts.
   Exotic lands and themes inspired many designers. Jean-Louis
Scherrer was praised for a collection based on the splendors of
North Africa and the Near East in Persian-rug weaves for his suits
and colorful hooded burnoose-style coats.
   Except for a wild jeweled bathing suit with tights, Christian
Lacroix kept his exuberance in check, though there was plenty of
glamor in evening dresses inspired by Goya, or contemporary gold
lame suits topped with enormous velvet artists' berets, as well as
some extravagant Moorish-style embroidery.
   Everything came up roses at Ungaro, who used magnificent flower
prints from dawn to dark. His bright piped tweed daytime suits in
grey, red or royal blue with their checked stoles were stunning too.
   It was in evening wear, however, that Ungaro and other
couturiers turned into real showmen. His extravagant, rosy silk
panniered dresses might not be to everybody's taste. But he offered
an alternative: glamorous black slinky crepe or chiffon gowns with
halter necklines, camisole or scooped-out tops draped in
rhinestones or pearls.
   For evening, anything goes as long as it looks rich. And
decolletes are more daring than ever, with bosoms pushed up under
empire curved bodices, visible in sparkly net or chiffon
see-throughs, or suggestive with necklines slashed to the waist.
   Feathers came out often _ ostriches, pheasant, cock and other
types were used. Scherrer's spicy asymmetrical draped and feathered
minis were especially titillating.
