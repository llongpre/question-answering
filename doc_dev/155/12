   Feathery-light fabrics and skin-baring styles
pepped up the runways Tuesday as designers revealed their happy
holiday haute couture clothes for summer.
   The day was a triumph for Emanuel Ungaro, who has been totally
seduced by a light new look. He's simplified his feminine styles to
essentials, using gossamer fabrics and stunning colors to display
his talents.
   This is great news for his fans who found some of his recent
shows overloaded with show-off trimmings and superfluous details.
   ``C'est la vie,'' Ungaro smiled after the show when asked if his
recent marriage had been an influence on his fashion. The
Italian-born couturier, long a Paris fixture, married Laura Fanfani
in November. They are expecting a baby.
   Ungaro's new looks started off with neatly fitted raw silk suits
in shades of bordeaux and chrome yellow followed by bi- and
tricolored light gabardine suits with swirling details in shades
from violet, pink and orange to khaki and some peacock blues.
   ``I was aiming for the elegance of my old master, Balenciaga,''
said Ungaro.
   His remarkable daytime looks included satin-lined short cashmere
coats in sizzling colors topping some beautifully cut and draped
short crepe dresses.
   When it came to dressier clothes, Ungaro followed through
beautifully. His slinky short silk shifts in all colors topped by
floaty mousseline squares were perfect in their understatement.
   Of course, Ungaro had to have some fun with rich fabrics. He
used plenty of heavy guipure lace, draped lame floral fabrics, and
sequined, brocaded jackets or blouses to haute couture advantage.
   Karl Lagerfeld also had a light touch in his show for Chanel,
which won warm praise from the fashion crowd.
   The abbreviated styles were resolutely younger than ever. They
were so short and sweet they looked apt for the junior miss set.
   Lagerfeld continued some of his past Chanel ideas. For instance
the shortie jacket over legs alone became a sort of pretty
coat-dress this time and in fact was cut sexily like a tulip. It
could be worn with a half-skirt or a puff of chiffon.
   These Lolitas often paraded down the runway in long ``Amazon''
or fitted riding jackets with deep decolletes. There were all kinds
of couture details: black velvet cuffs and lapels on the softest of
pinks, black and white raffia piping on many jackets and skirts,
graphic geometric patterns embroidered on a white mini-coat.
   To end it all in grand style, Lagerfeld brought out an array of
short-long evening gowns bathed in clouds of chiffon, sometimes
combined with elaborate guipure lace.
   Louis Feraud turned out a smashing collection of bright,
beautiful clothes showing the creator from the south of France in
top form. He led off with a garden party of emerald and violet
leaf-embroidered short suits with scoop necks, setting a sunny tone.
   Everything was bright and wearable, even the full, iridescent
taffeta garden-party gowns in shades of gold-red with tucks at
bustier and hemline.
   Feraud had lots to put anybody in a good mood. Sportive women
might like the emerald and black gros-grain blazer over a pleated
light satin emerald short skirt.
   A woman dressing for Paris would like the ivory white suits with
a black sunray yoke effect at the neck of a boxy jacket. The
broad-striped pastel linens would be winners for all kinds of
summer moments.
   An ebullient Feraud turned out a rainbow of pastels in crepe
dresses cut in arabesques or swirls topped by huge chiffon shawls.
   It was down to the sea for the end of the show with a gorgeous
line of sequined mermaid flapper dresses and prints in funny fish
motifs.
   All was light and lovely at Philippe Venet, who turned out his
usual superb couture looks _ this time sexier and more colorful
than ever.
   Not known to the masses, Venet is one of the rare couturiers who
owns his own business and makes a living by serving up custom-made
couture to a faithful clientele.
   He led off with lean raw silk outfits piped in satin, perhaps a
strapless dress and fitted jacket in bordeaux and coral setting the
tone for the clothes that followed. He featured some particularly
marvelous suits, scooping out many necklines to daring decolletes.
   The palette was lovely, and full of warm tones like tangerine,
peach, almond green, lilac and tender pink. But one shouldn't
forget the incomparably lovely iridescent satin and taffeta short
evening dresses with their huge bows and jeweled touches.
   Angelo Tarlazzi, the Italian-born couturier at Guy Laroche since
the designer died last year, went south of the border for his
inspiration. Some suggest he should have stayed there, since the
blouson toppers over narrow minis or ample peasant dresses with
stitched details looked more like ready-to-wear than couture.
   Not even the transparent chiffon-topped evening wear had enough
distinction to give the show cachet.
