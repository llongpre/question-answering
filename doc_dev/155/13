   Suits are back in force for spring _ especially as
haute couture sees the picture. They look everything from wildly
extroverted to wearable for business and travel.
   And the crowning glory of all the couture pizazz is _ what else?
_ hats. The designers let their fantasy run mad, from the sublime
to the silly.
   For couture _ which is not for average shoppers, but serves
mainly as a strong prototype for what might be found on the racks _
here are ideas to look for:
   Suits are nearly always waist-hugging and short, with jackets
short or long to choose from, and shoulders still shaped, but more
played-down than in the past.
   Saint Laurent's suits hit both day and dressy notes. His
sharply-tailored long jackets with double-breasted or belted safari
effects are worn with knotted chiffon scarves at the neck for
softening the seriousness of the suit.
   Large boater-style hats give his suits a cachet of total chic.
   His dressier suit is plastered with a sequined cubistic design,
elegance and height added by a wrapped fez hat in a different
color, such as purple to contrast with a turquoise satin skirt.
   Dior suits are peppier than ever, but still in the daywear
category. They're charmingly bouncy with stiffened, full skirts,
very small waists and the crowning touch of tiny perched boater
hats.
   Lagerfeld at Chanel has brought back some great Chanel ideas in
suits that are just above the knee _ terrific white tweeds bordered
in bicolored ribbon piping. The topper? For this spring's touch,
it's a large banded straw hat overturned like a salad bowl.
   His slinky long suits are harbingers of next winter; he says
they're definitely coming back. This is glorious news for those who
want to hide their knees. They look authoritative in checked and
solid ensembles with long tulip-wrapped jackets, and the salad-bowl
hat becomes bigger than ever.
   Budding out into springtime dressy looks, Nini Ricci showed
loads of suits with layers of ruffles on skirts, dressy jackets
fitted with a little padding on the shoulders, big stand-out peplum
effects on long jackets.
   Polka dots in these flirtatious clothes are often matched with a
big dotted sunhat.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer's silk suits come right out of the hothouse
for spring, with flowers all over them _ maybe teaming black and
white with bright flower prints in skirts, lapels and cuffs in
ultra-fitted suits. And of course, the big-brimmed garden-party hat
nearly eclipses the shoulders with flowers.
   More about hats: Solidly sane or simply crazy, they add a fillip
to any outfit, and lots of fun to the fashion party. Sailor hats
are a favorite at Louis Feraud. Maryll Lanvin opts for little
flower baskets to top her fussily feminine short outfits in a
collection based on her ``secret garden.''
   With flowers in patterns, appliques and even sleeve shapes in
these collections, naturally flowered hats are de rigueur.
   Pierre Cardin practically made a whole outfit with his gigantic
yellow wildflower chapeau covering the model's face, if not her
body _ which was clad in a slinging black mini.
   Kal Lagerfeld added an original touch to his Chanel collection
with the dashing multi-layered straw hat fluted in waves like a
seashell, but shaped more like a flounced stand-out skirt.
   Marc Bohan at Dior branched out into tongue-in-cheek fantasy by
pairing a feathery fright wig with all the allure of a jungle
``Hottentot'' to go with a draped zebra-striped dress.
   And in the devil-may-care vein, wonder boy Christian Lacroix
matched zany hats to some of his fanciful outfits. For a circus
look, he topped a puffy-skirted short dress with a towering tube
slightly curved for laughs. In a sunny beach-inspired mood, he
shaped a straw hat like a whorled sea-snail.
   With these showy or relatively safe toppers, there are plenty of
choices to try on and take home from the hat bar.
   But make sure you get the quick lift you'd get at a cocktail bar
_ rather than a hangover.
