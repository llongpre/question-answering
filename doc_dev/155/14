   Short or long skirts, fitted or trapeze coats _ the
fashion capital saw several silhouettes during the winter
ready-to-wear fashion circus.
   As fashion sails into the 1990s, the passage may be a bit rough
for women looking for direction and designers who don't seem to know
where to turn.
   But the good news is that individuals are truly free to choose
their style, whether in pants and skirts or jackets and coats. And
there is no evidence of designers conspiring to put women into
stylishly ridiculous gear.
   Those fed up with the skirt-length dilemma may just abandon the
skirt altogether and wear a beautiful hacking jacket or dressier
model over opaque tights as Lagerfeld displayed at both his own and
at the Chanel collection, with an elegant bow to the 1960s.
   Elsewhere, skirts were the familiar short lengths to just above
the knee, or nearly ankle-length in trumpet shapes, pleated or
handsome in a circle of leather at Ungaro.
   Christian Lacroix went his own eccentric way, showing softly
feminine silhouettes and his favorite flowing trapeze styles. Some
loved his loud patchwork looks for ready-to-wear; others were
dazzled by his more expensive ``Luxe'' collection, shimmering with
Byzantine splendor.
   Shoulders were softened or reduced to natural proportions in
feminine silhouettes that marked the waist without undue emphasis.
   The new long jacket was gently fitted, sometimes with a
martingale belting the back, while some were asymmetrical in front,
or outlined in bold piping. Yet others appeared in swallow-tail or
cutaway style.
   Snug spencers, battle jackets and boleros shared the honors for
diminutive jacket styles.
   From the men's wardrobe but looking handsomely feminine were
pinstriped bankers' suits at Hanae Mori and the straight tweed
trousers pleated at the waist by master tailors Yves Saint Laurent
and Jean-Louis Scherrer.
   Long redingotes and short hooded duffel jackets looked terrific,
but Paris also offers some handsome belted trenches, lounging coats
or car coats in luxury cashmere or wool blends _ sometimes collared
and lined with generous lashings of fur.
   Capes were a big item at Saint Laurent and Patrick Kelly, whose
Little Red Riding Hood was a show-stealer. And Italians Angelo
Tarlazzi and Romeo Gigli placed their models in cocoon coats.
Gigli's fabulous Byzantine-embroidered cocoon made news over his
outfits in butterfly-light fabrics.
   The color spectrum zoomed from a range of darks _ especially
chocolate brown and charcoal _ to autumnal Beaujolais, cognac,
caramel, gold, mustard, olive, forest green, and misty shades of
lavender and pink.
   Claude Montana's collection brought out hues of blue, from
glacier to deep petrol in his trouser suits.
   But there were hot colors, too, and those who love red will be
happy, as every shade pepped up the runways, from garnet,
fire-engine or poppy to orange-coral, fuchsia and magenta.
   The fabrics gave new softness to the clothes, with flecked
tweeds, big and bold glen or windowpane grid plaids, looking peppy
when placed on the diagonal.
   Butter-soft leather, calfskin or suede gave the appeal of luxury
to many outfits _ remarkable when appliqued with arabesque designs
on short Yves Saint Laurent jackets.
   A taste for exoticism ran to wild-animal prints, done in various
styles and fabrics at Hanae Mori, Scherrer, Lacroix and Kelly. But
the only true furs seen were fox, vicuna, Mongolian lamb and mink.
   Montana's mink was amazing, dyed in his favorite blues and ridged
to look like chenille or corduroy. Otherwise coats looked
appealingly warm in bright mohairs or Shetland.
   Wool and silk jerseys were used generously in softer styles _
especially in dresses, which made a modest comeback for day wear.
Knits often had ethnic overtones, black and white at Chanel,
startlingly bright at Lacroix.
   For late-day, the designers came up with some stunning cocktail
suits or dresses with jackets _ all fit to sup at the Ritz. Among
the most memorable: Chanel's lightly fitted gold corduroy-ridged
lame jacket over a satin-piped wrapped skirt topped with floppy
satin bows.
   Black velvet gave opulent allure to day or evening clothes, and
crimped panne or cut velvet added old-fashioned charm to much of the
evening wear.
   In fact, fabrics for after sunset were so luxurious that they
defined the lines of the outfit. Satin and slithery crepe de chine
were favorites for slinky dinner gowns or pajamas.
   Black silk ``grain de poudre'' was used in all versions of the
``smoking'' or tuxedo style _ still a wardrobe staple, whether with
pants or a skirt.
   Sheer chiffon revealed body lines, while iridescent taffeta
lightly puffed around it in other models. Lame fabrics and
embroidery made evening wear look bewitchingly shimmering, sometimes
sexy, but never glitzy.
   And the lame brocades at houses like Hanae Mori, Lacroix and
Saint Laurent shone with an extra dash of exoticism as the designers
went at least partly to the Far East, Byzantium or North Africa for
inspiration.
