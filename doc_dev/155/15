   Yves Saint Laurent won a long, standing ovation
Wednesday as he waltzed down the runway, kissing his models after a
show of summer haute couture featuring clean, colorful classics as
only he can make.
   The crowd's enthusiasm contrasted with Tuesday night's debut of
ready-to-wear wizard Claude Montana as haute couturier for the
celebrated house of Lanvin, a sad moment in which Montana seemed
out of his element.
   ``Yves Saint Laurent was more to the couture point,'' said
fashionable Paloma Picasso. ``I loved his evening wear, with so
many ideas and such fabulous color combinations, as usual.''
   Saint Laurent's day wear was both striking and wearable. It
centered on sharp white, ivory or navy ottoman or shantung suits _
including sleek pants or short skirts with tailored jackets.
   Disregarding fashion critics who tell him to discard shoulder
pads, Saint Laurent still shows his daytime clothes neatly padded
out to give shape. But the blouses underneath have softer shapes in
scoop-necked satin or organza models, with cap or raglan sleeves.
   He dedicated many models to past or present entertainment stars.
Some looked downright odd, like the frog-buttoned black gazar coat
over a pants suit dedicated to Rita Hayworth.
   But his homage to his home in Morocco was a simple white satin
sheath topped by a stunning jacket that made the dress. Engineered
by master embroiderer Francois Lesage, it was an extravaganza of
mirror sequins, beads and crystals.
   In easy-to-wear daytime lines, Saint Laurent turned out a soft
midnight blue silk chemise dress with big white buttons and several
silk shirt waists in jungle-panther prints.
   His faultless use of fabric and color went from slinky little
cream satin ``Mademoiselle de Paris'' short tea dresses to a fresh
blue plaid organdy dance dress with puffy sleeves and deep
decollete.
   Montana, by contrast, lacked the elegant elaboration of haute
couture. ``It was pure Montana,'' tersely commented Ellin Saltzman,
corporate fashion director of R.H. Macy Inc.
   Not that the clothes were bad; they had Montana's original
touch, and the great ready-to-wear creator of blousons put on lots
of them in luxury fabrics such as pink-lined copper satin over lean
linen pants.
   But the poor reception would seem a setback for Midland Bank,
which took over Lanvin last year and chose Montana to lead the
couture creation. Some observers thought Montana had done better
collections under his own label.
   The billowy white short gazar ``trench coats'' had Montana
cachet. Brown and earthy colors like khaki, tobacco, chocolate and
clay were featured in luxury fabrics.
   Montana based his silhouette on lean pants and jodhpurs, with
most interest in the toppers like a striped sequined shortie duffel
coat over navy shorts.
   But the audience looked mainly perplexed, with some sniffing
that the combinations just did not make a couture look. Rich
clientele who usually love Lanvin are unlikely to go for the
austere evening wear, with spider web see-through effects on top.
   However, lovely late-day ideas in fabulous fabrics were paraded
at the young couture house of Lecoanet-Hemant.
   The clothes were form-fitting, with clever draping, insertion of
elaborate lace touches under waistlines, lashings of white organza
on collars or skirt flounces adding dashes of fun.
   A typical little sexy cocktail outfit paired an asymmetrical
fitted jacket over a tiny lean coral leather skirt.
   Designer Didier Lecoanet also worked with new raffia lace trim
and gold braid effects in the bright outfits. Other summery touches
were in the mother-of-pearl shell embroideries.
   With some cutouts revealing skin for summer, plenty of bouncy
evening wear with short skirts in front and train effects in back,
the festive outfits in light organza, brocade, taffeta faille and
gazar were truly worthy of the haute couture label.
   The clothes, costing many thousands of dollars per outfit, are
mainly for show. Only about 2,000 women regularly buy couture,
which is meant to power the fashion houses' other activities, from
accessories to perfumes.
