   The good news about styles for the early 1990s is
that they seem to be aimed at women with minds of their own, rather
than at sheepish fashionplates to be herded into ridiculous garb to
look trendy.
   There's a vast choice in the offerings to send the 1980s out in
style. The clothes are hardly revolutionary, but the best are timely
and as freshly appealing as champagne.
   Designers are letting go of their recent visions of bouncy,
ruffly little girls in poufs, as well as slinky vamps.
   Finally, they're thinking of women who work, travel and like to
feel easy and pretty in whatever they choose. Whether the clothes
are based on masculine styles or are all dressed up for evening,
they are presented with an eye to both ease and elegance.
   Silhouettes and fabrics are softer in these new clothes, with a
light touch of body-consciousness in the structuring. Shoulders are
padded for shape but never dominate.
   Skirt lengths are barely relevant, though quite long and above
the knee are the younger-looking norms. Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel
dismisses any discussion of skirt lengths as being ``for old
crones.'' His answer to youth is to show some outfits without any
skirt at all _ simply tights under handsome jackets.
   Trousers are a welcome solution, though the wide A-line look has
been cut back to somewhat straighter lines _ on the dressy side in
suits _ with waist tucking, as at Saint Laurent and Jean-Louis
Scherrer.
   Jackets are starred everywhere. They range from very long styles,
flattering as they cover the derriere, to snug spencers, battle
jackets and boleros. Details may be strong in piping, zigzag
fastening, little belts or vents at the back.
   And several designers give fantasy touches with swallowtail or
cutaway styles in dressier models.
   Coats are another big story. If you like trench or belted
``bathrobe'' styles, you'll find handsome ones for fall.
   Italians designers like Tarlazzi and Romeo Gigli ``cocoon'' their
models in sumptuous coats. Tarlazzi's camel-colored wrap with a
bright lining is remarkable. Gigli's opulent Byzantine cocoons are
so colorful they seem to have already matured into butterflies.
   Christian Lacroix plays with the cape theme in loud color
combinations with his short suits or in more subdued styles to evoke
the England of Vita Sackville-West and the literary Bloomsbury set.
   Capes are glamorous at Saint Laurent and hot numbers at Patrick
Kelly, where little caped riding hoods are as fun as they are
colorful.
   As classic suits have come back into focus in the fashion
picture, so have soft dresses, looking better than ever as buttoned
coat dresses, shirtdresses and little shifts.
   Fabrics are important for these stylishly soft clothes, making
them more fluid and sensual than ever _ even the flecked caviar
tweeds. Large plaids, stripes and houndstooth checks offer new
choices at Christian Lacroix, Scherrer and elsewhere.
   Synthetics such as fake furs and wool or silk blends are looking
better than ever. And the new softer, lighter woolens are a boon to
travelers, who'd rather arrive not looking rumpled.
   Folk art is making a chic comeback with Lacroix's favorite
Provencal motifs or kilim rug designs, as well as the handsome black
and white Chanel knits borrowed from Indian weaves.
   Scherrer and Hanae Mori are keen on exotic animal prints and
weaves, and Scherrer's feather patterns add a light touch as well.
   Look for temptingly light jerseys, cashmeres, and knits in cables
and other textures this season, along with soft flannel and
broadcloth. The new tweed and serge don't scratch.
   The up-to-date gold, mustard, olive and forest green. Lavender
and deep purple or pink add a heathery touch to autumn wardrobes.
   But Paris isn't timid about color. The designers are prodigious
in their use of red _ everything from deep raspberry or garnet to
cardinal, orange-coral, fuchsia, fire engine or flame. These also
mix well with deep brown, purple or black.
   The evening scene means a transformation from workaday outfits to
splendidly feminine clothes for cocktails at the Ritz or dinner at
Maxim's. Black is still reliable for sexy little lace or velvet
numbers, and never before have silk ``grain de poudre'' tuxedo
outfits with pants or skirts looked so attractively varied or
feminine.
   But overall, we're seeing more late-day color, in decollete or
``bustier'' dresses with practical little jackets.
   Lame and brocade give dazzle to clothes for welcoming in 1990 _
especially the Japanese flower-print patterns at Hanae Mori, and the
Byzantine motifs at Lacroix, Gigli and elsewhere.
   Scene-stealing hats for these glamorous clothes are Lacroix's
``mad hatter'' chapeau, his big buccaneer hat, and large-brimmed
skimmers at Chanel. Turbans, berets and fur toques are also good
head warmers as well as fashionable.
