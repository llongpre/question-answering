   Hubert de Givenchy's summer ready-to-wear show
Friday burst out with lovely and wearable styles. This past master
of couture made the luxury clothes look very expensive, which they
are.
   It was a gilded collection, featuring gold threads in the first
knit items right through gilt nailheads all over, plus gold lame
shining through the colorful silk print dinner dresses at the end.
   On a new youth kick, the man who invented Audrey Hepburn's best
``gamine'' styles for her films more than 30 years ago gives his
latest styles modern updates. Among the youngest: a strapless
cable-knit top with a shortie black tulip-wrap skirt rimmed in gold
button details.
   His ballooning silky harem pants looked refreshing this week.
Everybody else is showing pants that look as though they'd been
molded on the model.
   Givenchy showed many well-cut straight trousers with good
cardigan and cable-knit tops, or jackets cut long and straight or
rather full. The fine poplins, linens and plenty of gold buttons
should please the rich set of a certain age.
   Younger fans will like his airy organza dresses and
off-the-shoulder minis in harlequin or bold fruit and flower
prints.
   The serpent theme gliding through a few collections here looks
gaily-colored on bright leather belts, narrow skirts, sleeve
details.
   Karl Lagerfeld also aims for younger looks, continuing his leggy
themes with good jackets and loose tops he started last year.
   Some of the best of this slim-leg look topped by flowing jackets
or cape effects came out in silky jersey fabrics in colors ranging
from subtle linden green or beige to salmon.
   Lagerfeld's pants are cigarette-slim, or simply cotton tights.
The young, but not very flattering, favorite style is to cut off
the dark tights at various lengths along the leg, showing bootees
below.
   Lots of ideas popped up from little apron outfits with shirred
waists right through to plaid jackets of all lengths and cuts worn
over the tights with matching plaid small boots.
   Bright piping on asymmetrical little dresses or sleeveless white
jackets had a certain young charm, along with the buttoned plastron
effects over short linen dresses in bright red or sky blue.
   Lagerfeld also went in for some graphic and check effects, using
checked sheer wraps over maillot bathing suits, and sequined
checkerboard decor for the evening wear in trapeze topped minis or
slinky sheaths.
   Bernard Perris also went all-out for graphic prints and sequined
late-day wear, in minis, long pants, and easy toppers.
   This designer has a raft of summer ideas, ranging from lace-up
safari styles to neon-striped graphics and body-molding leather
outfits in hot shades of vermilion, bright blue and cyclamen.
   His luscious sheer white embroidered blouses with tight sequined
black pants and gold belts evoked a brassy pirate set to swing at
the disco.
   Thierry Mugler put on a show worthy of a striptease nightclub,
but not all went smoothly.
   Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French president, and Culture
Minister Jack Lang were among those who waited nearly two hours in
sauna-type heat waiting for the show to begin.
   Before Mugler wound up with a nearly nude Diana Ross (with
chunky glass just decently covering the strategic points and a
fuchsia tulle cape), he'd brought out several other Imam and other
famous models, clothed in outrageous costumes.
   It was mainly lycra and skin, plus a few little bunnies in
bloomer-playsuits, and even a Chinese-lantern outfit in acid shades
of pink and green.
   The rare true dress or suit was applauded, in one case a
pleasantly draped white sheath as worn by famed model of the 1970s,
Lauren Htton.
   Another audience came back later to see Madonna swan down the
catwalk. But most observers agreed: Mugler should either make
clothes and show them as such or take up showbiz as his real
profession.
