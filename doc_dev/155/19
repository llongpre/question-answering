   Candice Fraiberger is her own best model: tall,
slim and totally Parisienne, she is a beautiful blonde who
specializes in dressy clothes to make others look beautiful too.
   Following a modest start four years ago, Fraiberger (pronounced
``fray-bear-jay'') is gradually proving she has an authoritative
flair for creating boutique clothes.
   Her new winter line unveiled last week showed well-cut
sarong-draped skirts, neat boleros with baroque appliqued
embroidery over strapless dresses, draped chiffons, plenty of
sequins and sparkle combined with lace, satin, taffeta and velvet.
   The only criticism of these finished clothes is that some look a
bit too fussy for the French. But so far, that doesn't matter,
because Fraiberger is now better-known in the United States than in
France.
   She regularly travels to posh American department stores, and is
well-known in emporia like Neiman-Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom's.
   Her clothes lack the hard-edge chic of styles by someone like
Jacqueline de Ribes, another society beauty designing her own label
line _ whose stricter, slinky silhouettes often recall Yves Saint
Laurent.
   But the Fraiberger line has more than a touch of haute couture
and therefore class. It's made in workshops in the Rue
Poissonniere, the heart of the garment district east of central
Paris, and is lovingly finished by seamstresses in the couture
tradition appreciated by connoisseurs.
   The luxury fabrics and detailing put them into a category
superior to ready-to-wear. But in their price-range of $2,000 to
$6,000 dollars per outfit, the clothes are worth watching.
   For price and quality, they compare favorably with lines like
Christian Lacroix's ``luxe,'' whose price tags can be double or
triple Fraiberger's.
   Indeed, with feminine touches like flared umbrella skirts over
crinolines and contrasts of pink and black velvet in embroidered
dresses with decorated matadors' boleros, one sees a definite
Lacroix influence at work here.
   ``Personally I never have time to think about what I wear,''
said Ms. Fraiberger after her small showroom parade of winter
cocktail and evening clothes. ``I'm totally absorbed by what I'm
making for others.''
   But she did look smashing in her black-and-white cotton summer
suit with beaded, embroidered lapels, fitted for elegance with just
a hint of sexiness.
   Paradoxically this ``fortysomething'' lady (who looks at least
15 years younger) has more fans in Houston than in Paris.
   ``I had learned about clothes from working in retail in France,
but it was the Americans who first enjoyed and ordered my styles
when I started my own business,'' said Ms. Fraiberger.
   Married to an investment counselor and mother of two grown
children, Ms. Fraiberger says she is financing her own business,
not backed by any grand consortium as many style creators are today.
   ``Sadly enough, I don't even have a proper boutique yet in
France,'' she said, adding that her friends and those in the know
come to her showroom at Rue Aguesseau, just around the corner from
the fashionable Faubourg Saint-Honore.
   However, she's selling well in style-conscious countries like
Japan and Germany, and is at last attracting favorable comments
from the French fashion press as well.
   ``I think the clothes look very well-made,'' said Christine
Marais, of French Harper's Bazaar.
   ``The feel of dressiness is quite American,'' observed Laurence
Beurdeley, of the glossy fashion magazine ``l'Officiel de la Mode.''
   Ms. Fraiberger says she believes in dressing up rather than
down, and is proud to look spiffy as a bandbox herself.
   ``I think the French are wrong to affect the casual styles seen
so much on the streets here,'' she says. ``It shows a sloppiness of
mind. I understand tourists wearing practical shoes for
sightseeing. But I think women should do their best to be feminine
and elegant.''
