   Runways sizzled and burst into bloom at summer
couture shows that opened over the weekend.
   The extravagant dream clothes by Gianni Versace, Christian
Lacroix, Hanae Mori and Torrente showed that flowers and feathers
will be hot this summer.
   Italian Gianni Versace got a jump on the French fashion houses
by showing his feathery decollete styles Saturday night at the Ritz
Hotel.
   ``Paris is mine'' crowed the 43-year-old designer, who is not an
official member of the French designers association and was staging
his first show of atelier clothes in the City of Lights.
   Versace turned out witty, minx-like and colorful styles with
enough elaborate beading to create a couture effect.
   ``Great for wives of the mafia,'' groused one resentful French
fashion commentator.
   But Julie Andrews loved them. ``Especially the little sheaths
with boa effects and jeweled necklines,'' said the star.
   Versace is designing the costumes for ``Ch'in Ch'in,'' a new
film starring Miss Andrews and Marcello Mastrioanni and directed by
Gene Saks.
   Versace won hearts with his sexy cuts that were too playful to
be vulgar. His use of elaborate beading, ostrich feathers and
rhinestones on asymmetrically draped long skirts and short skirts
were typical of the inventive Italian.
   His swirled breastplate effects on bustiers vied with
embroidered commedia dell'arte harlequin and abstract effects in
hot colors on lean pants or skirts. Also featured were
ostrich-feather tutu styles and a rhinestone-edged, flame-red
sheath split to the hip.
   Christian Lacroix's show Sunday night at the Intercontinental
Hotel ballroom was no less stunning and began with some wonderful
dressy silk and crepe suits with fitted asymmetrical jackets and
huge rhinestone buttons.
   Lacroix used opulent fabrics, often bringing out his signature
touches like trapeze-shaped coats, enormous puffy sleeves, draped
fichu or shawl effects and the occasional big organza bow-train
down the back. He also brought out some luscious organzas edged in
appliqued flowers.
   Lacroix used clouds of ostrich feathers to give a light touch to
some beautifully cut chiffons and georgette silks in delectable
colors like butter, peach and tea-rose pink.
   And looking at the bias cuts leaves no doubt: Lacroix may be an
artist above all, but he's definitely become a couturier.
   Japanese couturier Hanae Mori _ considered a Paris designer for
more than 15 years now _ showed the sexiest, youngest fashions
she's ever designed.
   Her skirts were often draped, clinging with hemlines way above
the knee, and jackets were fitted and sometimes featured plunging
necklines over sweetheart strapless dresses.
   Brown was a favorite color with Mrs. Mori, and she dolled it up
beautifully in white-striped fitted silk grosgrain suits, draped it
and paired it with lace in slinky evening gowns.
   She also went in for some siren-like vermilion draped silks, and
striking shades like cyclamen purple paired with gold lame.
   Besides her enchanting trademark sequined Japanese landscape and
wave-patterned embroidered dresses, Mrs. Mori also used some of her
favorite motifs _ butterflies and flowers.
   Torrente, whose real name is Rose Mett, also laid on a
lighthearted show that included pique suits with swooped hems on
the fitted jackets for day wear. She dressed up navy crepe suits to
advantage with gold lame rick-rack piping, and some of her great
flower-girl looks centered on enormous anemone print chemise
dresses that looked very easy to wear.
   Among her charming girlish looks were short lace ballerina
dresses and slinky strapless gowns with touches of raffia.
