   Young, skin-baring and refreshing are the first
messages as ready-to-wear shows for next spring get under way.
   More than 80 designers will be showing for the next week in a
courtyard in the Louvre and elsewhere, spending up to $200,000 for
the larger runway shows.
   There appears to be as much hype and crowd interest as in the
past, despite of market downtrends and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Lolita Lempicka got applause Wednesday for a lilting collection
that featured micro-models with bustiers and bras shaped like
underwear.
   This lingerie trend started out with several houses last season,
and Lempicka took it into a perky ingenue vein, adding lace to
little green or pink satin slip dresses, covering them decently
with peppy short trench coats.
   She, like several other designers showing this week, liked the
look of bare backs crossed by straps, and occasional bare midriffs.
As her forte is suits, she put plenty of pep back into grey flannel
by adding appliqued flower details.
   Some of her shortie prints had a certain 1940s nostalgia with
their fit and head-wraps, though they were far too short for that
period.
   Those wanting to dress up Lolita-style might try some of the
little white dresses decked out in big pearl or silver baubles and
buttons. If they were not in light summer fabrics, they would look
just fine along with the skaters at Rockefeller Center at
Christmas.
   Lempicka showed some safari suits and appealing sailor looks,
turning up already elsewhere as well.
   At Dorothee Bis, the clothes also had a youthful bent - with
shorts, shortie jackets, flaring tent dresses, corsair and longer
pants. They came in red-white-blue linens and kabig, a kind of
smooth broadcloth like that used in pea jackets.
   Paco Rabanne's show in a small Left Bank shop was also a hit for
the younger set who can wear the stretch fabrics and micro-minis.
   The Spanish-born inventor of the chain-mail and metallic dresses
put a witty little flourish on some of his bare-midriff cotton
outfits: they were made of cotton patterned just like his original
metal-plate models of some 20 years ago. Some were even cut and
metal ringed, though the plates were cotton this time.
   Metallic lame stripes in green and warm yellow added late-day
dash to trouser outfits.
   Ishiro Kimijima's collection was one of the most creative so
far. This 61-year-old Japanese brought out a smart group of
beachwear with fishnet inspiration, a good use of raffia, lots of
see-through voile over bikinis or shorts.
   He took Nefertiti and ancient Egypt for some inspiration. But he
also used plastic minis to advantage, and many of the clothes had
seashell and starfish embroideries and decor.
   Kimijima's heavily bewigged mermaids ending the show draped in
strands of lame-lace looked as if they'd just emerged from a golden
seaweed sea.
   Another, younger Japanese, Inoue Jun, showed equally short and
youthful lines for his company called June, July, Auguste, who
showed in a small space on the Right Bank.
   His forte for next summer is in the skimpy but well-cut little
jackets with soft shoulders. They're worn over shortie skirts or
shorts with some longer looks thrown in for good measure. He
concentrates on soft, offbeat pastel shades and blues in a bluejean
vein.
   The house of Lecoanet-Hemant opted out of a big runway show. But
their rack line shown in a hotel display room had some fine ideas
for summer, with plenty of expensive couture touches.
   Stone-washed soft silk suits with soft cuts and short skirts
look quite elegant in either salmon or coral pink, deep navy or
black.
   They also pep up a well cut, easily-fitted dark shantung silk
suit with life-saver embroideries in rust-shaded raffia.
   A fine topper here for a slinky stretch skirt or hostess pyjamas
is the generous acid-green waffled organza blouse with a big collar
and billowing sleeves tied under the elbow.
   One striking innovation is the use of copper-metal threads for a
new fabric in a transparent blouse, typical of Lecoanet-Hemant's
occasional enthusiasm for eccentric but beautiful new fabrics.
