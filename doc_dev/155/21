   Hanae Mori kicked off her 35th anniversary
exhibition Friday with a parade of most-loved creations celebrating
her sense of beauty and elegance.
   The show previewing an exhibition of the works of Asia's only
designer of haute couture was held in the Hanae Mori building in
Tokyo's swank Omotesando district.
   Many of her 85 favorite creations, ranging from her colorful
Japanese ``happi'' suits of 1981 to her 1989 ``Wave and Butterfly''
dress in silk, carried her colorful trademark.
   The show included only one outfit from the 1960s: a butterfly
dress from her 1968 New York collection presented three years after
the Japanese designer brought her ``pret-a-couture'' line to the
United States.
   She has continued to create the soft and flowing chiffons and
silky butterfly-flower prints that won favor with American
customers, while exploring a wide range of silhouettes and fabrics
in Paris.
   The show and exhibition, which opens July 4, are a rare
retrospective for Mrs. Mori, who said in a recent speech here that
she thought it was ``about time I looked back at my own footsteps.''
   ``I've been doing some philosophical soul-searching about what
fashion is,'' she said. ``Apparel wraps the human drama as it
develops.''
   That drama, she said, is the mystery and allure of how men and
women interact.
   ``As I look back ... I have come to feel that people, especially
women, have changed a great deal,'' she said.
   Mrs. Mori's marriage of Eastern fabrics and tradition, with their
suggestion of hidden beauty, and the Western couturiere's sense of
striking individual beauty, however, seem timeless.
   Unlike avant-garde Japanese designers Issey Miyake and Yohji
Yamamoto, Mori dresses always are classically feminine.
   Mrs. Mori's fabrics always have been sumptuous: silks, rich wools
and glittering sequins. Regal brocades recall more courtly eras.
   Three ballerinas danced through the runway wearing short tafetta
and chiffon ball gowns of 1986: a slinky ``rose ensemble'' from 1977
and flirty ``daisy dresses'' from 1988, all shapely and romantic,
not shocking.
   Mrs. Mori's elegant designs are worn by the wives of Japanese
prime ministers and even Empress Michiko.
   The 1970s, ``an era that wasn't for making women beautiful,''
didn't appeal much to Mrs. Mori. ``Women were not at their best in
terms of beauty,'' she said.
   The 1980s suit her better. ``Nowadays, health and nature is
beautiful,'' she said. ``After all, I'm Japanese ... I like things
fragile and effervescent.''
   Despite her restrospective, Mrs. Mori says looking forward comes
more naturally to her.
   ``I rarely look at the past,'' she said. ``The nature of my work
is to anticipate how people will live in the world to come and stay
a step ahead.
   ``Sometimes I want to make something, but it's too early. So I
put it back in my treasure chest and wait for the right time.''
