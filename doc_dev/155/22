French actress Capucine, who played the slinky seductress in the first "Pink 
Panther" movie, jumped to her death from her eighth-floor apartment, police 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old actress, who starred in movies with such Hollywood stars as 
John Wayne, Stewart Granger and Peter Sellers, took her life Saturday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss media said friends who knew her since she moved to Lausanne on Lake 
Geneva 28 years ago reported that she had lately been ill and depressed. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Toulon, France, as Germaine Lefebvre, Capucine first studied painting 
and then became a model. She won Hollywood fame in films of the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful, tall and dark-haired, Capucine was the slinky femme fatale in the 
first of the "Pink Panther" comedy films with Sellers playing the loony French 
police inspector. 
</P>
<P>
She chose the stage name Capucine from the French for an exotic ornamental 
South American flower with large petals that are typically orange.
