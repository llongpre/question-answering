   Spring fashions will be sealed with a kiss from
the '60s _ but bows and bubbles will replace love beads this time
around.
   The mood is flirty and fun _ romantic and dramatic.
   And body-conscious.
   Short skirts were the most obvious blast from the past as
designers revealed their upcoming lines. The tent dress _ mini, of
course _ was revived by Adrienne Vittadini. Some models piled
plastic bangle bracelets up their arms.
   And there was plenty of Flower Power: frequent floral prints;
skirts curved and layered like upside-down tulips; fabric flowers _
attached as a simple corsage or, ala Betsey Johnson and Bill Blass,
stuck all over the dress.
   But the stark options of the '60s also have been tempered with
plenty of old-style chiffon and elegant silk, along with buoyant
skirts, frothy sleeves, pretty sundresses and even a few bustles.
   Fanciful, pumpkin-shaped bubble skirts appeared frequently,
along with a less-radical version that's been dubbed a ``collapsed
bubble.'' Bob Mackie took bubbles one step beyond, turning them
into bustles, ruffles and stand-up collars.
   Lace, sequins and gleaming, intricate beadwork also made for
after-dark glamour.
   Day or night, black and white still prevailed, along with bold
teal, fuchsia and goldenrod yellow. Polka dots, ruffles, big
buttons and bows cropped up often _ the latter in every conceivable
location. Waists were nipped and accented with wide belts or sashes.
   Shoulders were bared in strapless, bustier sundresses and
off-the-shoulder jackets and dresses.
   When it came to gams, Cathy Hardwick's collection was the
leggiest of the lot. One strapless, green and yellow cotton dress
by Mary Jane Marcasiano was too snug and short for anything but
mincing steps. Ronaldus Shamask also had some shockingly short
selections.
   Ellen Tracy's silk, knee-skimming tulip-shaped skirts were soft
and feminine. Even a few offerings from traditionalist Laura Ashley
crept slightly above the knee.
   To hem or not to hem? The undecided could opt for Bob Mackie's
tight, beaded black dress, featuring a diagonal hem slashed from
knee to thigh. Or try the cookie-cutter hemlines, many to mid-calf,
that spiced the new made-in-America collection by Soviet couturier
Viyacheslav Zaitsev.
   The other alternative _ trousers _ was the opposite of
body-conscious: Perry Ellis' loose, ankle-skimming pants; Donna
Karan's navy pajama pants, teamed with slinky, wrapped tops; Mary
McFadden's flowing palazzo pants, with ridges of delicate mushroom
pleats tumbling from waist to hem; Ronaldus Shamask's high-waisted
pants, shorts or culottes with sashes.
   Only bike pants, like those offered by Adrienne Vittadini, were
slim, and they often were topped with long dusters or tunics.
   Geoffrey Beene favored the jumpsuit, heralding his black, crepe
version with a halter neck and a swimsuit back as ``the new
ballgown.''
   Shorts had fashion flair, too: like Williwear's cuffed,
knee-grazing walking shorts teamed with a double-breasted blazer or
a smartly cropped jacket; Vittadini's mint-green, cuffed shorts
with a bra-top and unstructured jacket.
   The shorts also were part of a new, below-the-waist, layered
look.
   Ashley's two-piece halter dress in a splashy print featured a
wrap-around skirt that unraveled to reveal matching shorts.
Carolina Herrera's billowing, black and white, silk organza skirts
were cut away in front to reveal beaded camisoles and shorts.
   Some designers also layered dresses and skirts with petticoats,
or a second skirt, peeking out from beneath.
   Williwear's eye-catching Egyptian print skirt opened to show a
solid-colored, cotton-eyelet skirt. Johnson's stretchy tube-dress
in black and white gingham was prettied up with a buoyant,
knee-length skirt and can-can slip. Beene's short, sweet, baby-doll
circle skirts were fluffed out with petticoats.
   And just about every designer braved one ensemble that combined
unlikely fabrics or prints. Mary Ann Restivo and Ralph Lauren, for
instance, showed floaty, chiffon skirts with tailored jackets.
