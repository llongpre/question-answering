in other words, a staple. There can hardly be a female wardrobe that does
not sport a pair. They are what we put on when we get dressed on auto-pilot
when we're off to potter round the shops.
They can be teamed with skinny rib knits or cropped sweaters if you are
young and lithe, with thigh-covering shirts or sweaters if you are not. With
Lycra they accommodate almost every size and shape. They come dark and
serviceable for everyday, or slinky and velvety for glamour.
But what happens to the legging now that fashion has done a volte-face and
gone all soft and feminine? Like all successful species, the legging has
evolved and adapted itself seamlessly to the new fashion environment and is
still on all the smartest shelves, alive and kicking.
The new-look legging this winter comes in many moods: satin-backed crepe,
silk chiffon, velvet, linen, wool or cotton. The newest are something of a
hybrid - a cross between a legging and a proper pair of trousers. For the
young, slim, trendy and long-legged there is the flare - French Connection
do some marvellously slinky ones in rich dark chocolate and dark blue as
well as black at Pounds 69.99. Hue, as ever on the ball, has some in a thick
matt soft but unclingy nylon/Lycra mix at Pounds 55 a time.
In sporty mode there is even more choice - from Ally Capellino's Hearts of
Oak leggings in ecru ribbed cotton, with something of the elan of a jodhpur,
at Pounds 60 a time to Artwork's beautiful indigo coloured cuffed cotton
jersey versions at Pounds 63.
You will like the look but maybe not the prices. Whereas once leggings
seemed to cost only roughly twice the price of tights nowadays, unless a
plain chain-store version suits you (and Marks and Spencer is still doing
plain classic leggings for about Pounds 16 and its jodhpur versions for
Pounds 19.99) the sky's the limit. However, for comfort they still beat the
classic pair of trousers hands-down.
