   British designers abandoned power dressing in
their first collections for the 1990s, some returning to the wacky
madness that made London fashions famous and others launching the
decade in a relaxed, flowing style.
   After putting women in status-conscious, super-structured
clothes with big, padded shoulders for several years, British
designers have followed Milan in loosening up their styles for next
summer.
   But there's no uniform look and individuality remains the key
fashion word in the British collections, being shown through
Tuesday.
   ``I would say it's anything flows in the 1990s and
super-structure is out,'' said Bernie Ozer, vice-president of AMC
Corp., the giant New York buying company. ``The structured jacket
is out but jackets in softer varieties and shapes are a must for
the '90s. ... It will also be the decade of the accessory which has
never gotten its proper due.''
   The big names in British fashion _ Rifat Ozbek, Arabella Pollen,
Bruce Oldfield, Edina Ronay and Bellville Sassoon _ turned out some
beautiful clothes. But the big news was in the youth market where
there was a revival of kooky, fun and sometimes off-the-wall
clothes.
   ``The street look here has always been good,'' Ozer said.
``Sometimes it's fashionable to like it. Sometimes it's
unfashionable to like it. It's now in fashion.''
   Bodymap did their first catwalk show in three years on the theme
``Life Is,'' featuring rock stars, drag queens, mini-skirts with
plants and roses, Victorian-style bathing suits and one-shoulder
cycle suits.
   Red or Dead's Space-Baby Collection, which admittedly looks at
the future with ``tongue firmly in cheek,'' was a hit with buyers
including the U.S. chain Nordstrom and New York's Trash and
Vaudeville boutique and Los Angeles' Roppongi boutique.
   It features see-through plastics appliqued with a logo of a
smiling space-baby in a plastic helmet, micro shorts, skirts and
jackets cheekily cut away to reveal flesh _ the skirts with two
waistbands and two transparent space-baby belts.
   ``It's just a fresh approach rather than all the power-dressing
that's been around for years,'' said 28-year-old co-owner Wayne
Hemingway. ``It's bright, cheerful, fun and the reaction has been
brilliant.''
   Vivienne Westwood, the 48-year-old godmother of British fashion
innovation who instituted the punk cult during the 1970s and is a
nominee for Designer of the Year, showed her collection ``Britain
Must Go Pagan'' Monday evening. Though it had its wild moments,
many buyers said it was one of her most commercial ranges.
   It certainly was not for anyone with an extra ounce of fat,
featuring very sexy body-clinging catsuits, one-shoulder
mummy-style knit mini-dresses, and skimpy shorts, one pair with an
outrageous gold phallus. Many designs were decorated with
rhinestone chains, some draped in tiers down to the floor and
others dangling from the calf.
   Pam Hogg, a young Scottish designer who used to show with
Hyper-Hyper, did her first solo collection, another very sexy show
with bras like belts, leggings and skin-tight bustier tops, lace-up
corsets, and clinging trousers with stretch patent leather in back
and a series of straps in front with a bikini peeping through.
   Much of the media and buyer attention focused on the six
contenders for the Designer of the Year that is being presented
Tuesday night by Princess Diana.
   Rifat Ozbek, last year's winner and a hot contender again this
year, abandoned his love of color for a stunning all-white
collection called ``New Age Nirvana,'' which won raves from the
critics.
   His quest for purity features silky knit jogging pants, softly
wrapped skirts topped by loose and layered tunics, shimmering,
sequinned, off-the-shoulder dresses, boleros and hooded bomber
jackets _ one studded with crystal rhinestones, the yin yang symbol
and the appliqued message ``Release It.''
   Workers for Freedom, the design duo of Graham Fraser and Richard
Nott who were also nominated, did linen shirts trimmed in lace,
frilled and fitted waistcoats over soft, cropped silk trousers and
ankle-length chiffon skirts strewn with artificial flowers and worn
with slinky silk tank tops.
   Nominee Katharine Hamnett did a raunchy 1950s baby doll
collection and fellow contender Joe Casely-Hayford chose the four
elements _ earth, air, fire and water _ for his show.
   The Spanish gypsy inspired Arabella Pollen, one of Princess
Diana's favorite designers and another contender, who showed soft,
short shirt-jackets and decorative waistcoats as well as natural
linens and her perennial little sexy dresses and suits.
   ``I think everyone is fed up with power dressing,'' she said.
``A lot of softer things are going well.''
