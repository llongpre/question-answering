   Valentino, a new fashion pavilion and a show down
the famed Spanish Steps combined to lift the sagging image of
Rome's high fashion week.
   Sixteen of Italy's leading designers sent actors and
international models down the steps in their most beautiful
creations for the upcoming fall and winter.
   The hour-long show Thursday night, which ended with a fireworks
display, was beamed live thoughout Europe and to the Soviet Union
for the first time.
   Grace Jones created the biggest splash by frolicking in the
fountain at the bottom of the steps in a slick black leotard before
donning a luxurious blue-dyed sable fur by Fendi.
   The top Italian designers, who also include Mila Schoen, Rocco
Barocco, Galitzine, Laug, Lancetti and Balestra, produce beautiful
styles enhanced by sumptuous fabrics and artisan detailing. But the
Italian couture scene has lost the excitement of the 1960s when the
fashion creativity of such designers as the Fontana Sisters,
Capucci and Shubert, went hand in hand with the wild spirit of the
Dolce Vita.
   Rome's loss has been Paris' gain. Not only have their own
designers combined to make the ``Made in France'' label the queen
of couture but they also have lured some of the best Italian talent
into their fashion net.
   Valentino, who strayed from Italy a decade ago to present his
ready-to-wear collection in Paris, has a second showing of his
couture during the French fashion week, meaning that the bulk of
his international customers need not make an extra trip to Rome to
admire his wears.
   But Valentino swears he won't abandon the Italian capital. He
has just restored another wing of his Rome headquarters, a 16th
century building in the shadow of the Spanish Steps and this week
announced a collaboration agreement with the Italian maufacturing
company Gruppo Finanziario Tessile to produce his high fashion
collections.
   The Italian fashion chamber set up a pavilion in Villa Borghese
park for the shows.
   As his maid of honor for the Spanish Steps gala, Valentino chose
Italian actress Ornella Muti in a red silk gown. Carroll Baker,
famous for creating the scanty pajama vogue after her film ``Baby
Doll,'' had trouble inching her way down in a slinky evening gown
by Sarli.
   Outfits presented during the week included Lancetti's rich
velvet gowns with passementerie trimming inspired by the Italian
Renaissance; glittery black sequined gowns by Rocco Barocco;
elegant suits, blouses and penthouse party gowns by the late Andre
Laug; and sexy black evening gowns by Mila Schoen.
   But the winning card of the fashion week was the stunning show
of the maestro, Valentino, who outdid himself with a fall-winter
collection inspired by the geometric designs of the Vienna Liberty
school at the beginning of the century.
   The perfect little black dress in velvet or chiffon or a
combination of both was the star of the show, at times worn under
an extravagant floor-length white coat with black geometric
embroidery.
   For daytime, Valentino favors his trademark neat little suit,
adorning it either with velvet geometric detail or colored pompon
buttons in tufts of wool or silk gleaned from the fabric of the
suit.
