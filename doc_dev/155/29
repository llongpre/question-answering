   The big ready-to-wear winter fashion shows don't
begin until mid-March, but a new Japanese designer named Jun Inoue
jumped the gun with a low-key collection of coordinates.
   His adorable trapeze mini-coats, well-cut buttoned jodhpur
pants, beautiful fabrics and excellent cuts, displayed Wednesday,
would be good news in any collection for next winter.
   Jun Inoue, working under the name ``Jun, July, Auguste,'' is
just the latest Japanese designer trying to make it in Paris.
   Kenzo came into his own over 18 years ago, Hanae Mori turned
into a ``French'' couturiere about 20 years ago, Issey Miyake has
shown in Paris for years, and Rei Kawakubo stunned her audiences
with clothes shot full of holes for ``Comme des Garcons'' more than
a decade ago.
   Opting for a quiet show in the cellar of his small boutique near
the Louvre that will open officially next summer, Jun was modest
but hopeful for a big future in Paris and all over the world.
   ``Paris is the place to be,'' said Jun, 37. ``I've lived here 15
years, and get my inspiration here.''
   ``I thought he did a wonderful job,'' said Jean-Paul Gaultier,
for whom Jun worked eight years. The way-out wonder boy of French
fashion, Gaultier said he liked the details like a shirred
mini-dress in soft fabrics worn over a silky turtleneck undershirt.
   Inoue's small collection was smart and young in every way. He
led off with well-cut black cuffed shorts worn with a high-waisted
long jacket nipped in by a drawstring with a high waistline, the
outfit topped with a jaunty sailor's beret.
   The high waistline, often buckled at the side, was a kind of
signature for Jun's leggy look that was always paired with matching
or contrasting opaque tights _ exclusive productions for Jun _ and
little flat suede oxords.
   While the gamine mini look was young, there was a lot for women
of all ages who want a bit of originality in their closets. The
softly belted trench coats, the checked pants suits with narrow
jodhpur-style trousers buttoned up from the ankle could be worn by
almost anyone.
   Details can make or break a collection, and Jun found some
excellent touches. His mother-of-pearl buttons with a dangling
pearl to doll up dark blazers and coats are not seen anywhere else.
   One dress sure to make a hit was a camisole slip-like mini
number with a heavy eyelet embroidered decor on the top and hem,
worn with a slinky T-shirt top and contrasting tights. The same
eyelet detail on collars pepped up shortie coats with their flared
skirts.
   The fabrics were soft but warm for winter, the color
combinations autumnal and artistic. Besides navy and black, there
were touches of dusty rose or blue, ochre, khaki and aubergine or
burgundy, often worked together in appealing combinations.
   One of the real originals in the collection was a brown
velveteen dress shirred around the scoop neckline and at the waist,
worn with a silky high-necked green shirt underneath.
   For dressier moments, Jun also used chiffon to fashion fly-away
minis over matching tights, beautiful in deep blue and ochre. Other
ideas included his strict black tuxedo with narrow chino pants, the
jacket lapels made of a ribbon effect over a polka-dotted blouse.
   Whether working with taffeta or elasticized wool jersey, Jun
seemed right at home with his fabrics, showing exquisite tailoring
and cut.
   ``Jun, July, Auguste'' has Japanese backing by the Five Fox
retail group, and they hope to do well in France before starting
marketing in the United States.
   The clothes will be manufactured for the French market by
Chofflet-Style in Moulins in central France, who also make clothes
for well-known names like Paco Rabanne, Azzedine Alaia and Popy
Moreni.
   Priced around $475 to $700 for a long jacket or coat, the
clothes may sound expensive. But by high-quality luxury
ready-to-wear standards these days, they're almost a steal for
anybody who wants original touches in a fashionable wardrobe.
