   More than 40,000 models of a classic American
toy have been recalled because paint used on them may contain too
much lead, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The agency also says hundreds of thousands of clown dolls are
being recalled because they pose a choking hazard.
   The makers of ``Slinky'' animal pull toys, a variation on the
standard accordion-like wired toy, are voluntarily recalling them
because the red paint used on the eyes, tongue and cheeks may
contain a higher percentage of lead paint than the agency allows.
   CPSC standards limit to .06 percent the lead content of paint
used on children's items.
   The 43,000 Slinky toys sold since 1986, have red and white pull
cords and come in the form of a train, worm, seal, frog,
caterpillar, dalmation and kitten. They are made by James
Industries Inc. of Hollidaysburg, Pa.
   The CPSC also said 234,000 dolls manufactured by the Omaha-based
Oriental Trading Co. and sold through mail order catalogues as the
``Dress Up Clown'' or ``Funny Clown'' were recalled because they
have small parts that present a choking risk to young children.
   The agency said the 13-inch dolls, used to teach children to
dress themselves, have zipper clasps, buttons and buckles that came
off during standard tests.
   ``These small parts make the dolls banned hazardous substances
because they present a choking, ingestion and aspiration hazard to
children,'' the agency said in a written statement.
   There have been no reported injuries associated with either toy.
   Consumers may return the toys to the place of purchase for a
full refund.
