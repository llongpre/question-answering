<LEADPARA>  THE San Jose Museum of Art Auxiliary's recent debut fashion show luncheon will
be a hard act to follow.;   Focusing on the designs of Diane Freis and using
community members, including San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer, as models, it proved
to be a cohesive presentation. The show was an eye-opener for those who think
of Freis strictly in the vein of the confetti-print, ruffled,
one-size-fits-all dresses that first established her as a popular designer.
There were sexy black velvet dinner suits with a smattering of embroidery on
the jackets; slinky jumpsuits with chiffon over-skirts; solid-color quilted
skirts and pants teamed with print jackets; a heavy dose of metallic prints,
and some beautiful beaded and sequined jackets. The clothes came from the San
Francisco boutique of the California-born, Hong Kong-based designer, who
couldn't attend.  </LEADPARA>
