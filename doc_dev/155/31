   Geoffrey Beene believes the jumpsuit could
become the unisex look of the future. But his svelte, black version
for spring harkens feminine magic.
   Rising star Angel Estrada has mixed up some magic of his own in
elegantly draped silk dresses.
   Beene describes his slinky, black, crepe jumpsuit, with a halter
front and a swimsuit back, as ``the new ballgown.'' He tops it with
a sharp, cropped jacket in coral, yellow or white.
   Another enchanting, black jumpsuit is studded with pink moons
and stars. The heavenly motif appears again at the waist and
neckline of a long, slightly clingy, black gown.
   Throughout his collection, necklines are slashed into striking
geometric shapes, including stars. ``Fashion is both magic and
magical,'' observes Beene. ``It's a Snow White kind of magic.''
   The designer also favored polka dots, especially in baby-doll
dressing dominated by short, sweet circle skirts and petticoats.
   One version, with an empire waistline, was strapless and sugary
in white-and-black dots with curvy piping around the hemline. A
strapless, black, bustier dress was zippered in front and back,
with a black, full, baby-doll skirt in black-and-white dots. Many
skirts landed about four inches above the knees.
   Beautiful, billowy coats were another of Beene's crowning
glories. A black, street-length, Phantom of the Opera coat swirled
like a cape. White, scalloped lace circled its stand-up collar.
   Swishy, suave, calf-length raincoats were fashioned in green or
gray. A short, effervescent, Ultrasuede coat in fuchsia or coral
sprouted an uneven hemline. A yellow cotton sheath with a square
neck and zip front is splashed with black jonquils; the matching
coat had a capelike back.
   Estrada's silk designs, in crepes, taffeta and chiffon, are
based on the trim, timeless, princess silhouette. His draping
provides la difference.
   A mint green mini-dress has a foamy cowl that floats down over
the shoulders. A gold micro-mini, not for the faint-hearted,
resembles a swimsuit, with draping over the bustline and a bustle
effect in the back. A short, red, bustier dress looks almost like a
jumper over a see-through blouse with balloon sleeves.
   When the Renaissance mood strikes, m'lady would be fetching in a
pink, strapless, ankle-length gown, slightly flared at the bottom,
with spaghetti straps and plunging back. The long-sleeved
bolero-style jacket rises to the midriff. The ensemble is completed
with a medieval hat topped with two tall, pink horns and yards of
veil.
