<LEADPARA>  IT'S unseasonably hot and humid on the streets here, but inside the formal
ballrooms of the "P" hotels -- as in Plaza and Pierre -- it's strictly fall
and winter.;    Here's a look at some of the specific looks American designers
would like to see women wearing come September:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Bill Blass;  Blass is mad for plaid -- particularly tartans and houndstooth
-- as well as stripes for day and luxury fabrics such as panne velvet, lace,
satin and beading for evening.;    Very distinctive are Blass' double-wrap
skirts, two oblong pieces of fabric -- one wrapped to the left, another to the
right, overlapping in front and back. The result is an uneven hemline that's
interesting and looks to be less revealing than the traditional wrap skirt.;  
 Much of the Blass collection is clearly meant for special-occasion and
evening wear. Particularly sexy, and sure to be copied widely, are the formal
velvet smoking jackets casually tied with sashes, bathrobe-style.;    One
accessory worth noting from Blass is the watch cap -- it showed up on many of
the day dresses and suits and even for evening with the addition of a
rhinestone pin.;    Arnold Scaasi;  Starting off with Scottish-style tartan
dresses and a stirring bagpipe march, Scaasi's obviously hearing a different
drummer than the rest of the designers showing collections thus far. While
others are sticking with shorter hemlines, Scaasi has dropped his to and below
the knee.;    Scaasi's favorite silhouette in this predominantly evening
collection is a shoulder-baring, waist skimming, full skirt. Frankly, it's
hard to imagine Barbara Bush exposing her shoulders in one of these dresses,
but on many women it could be a flattering look. And since Scaasi is her
favorite designer, he no doubt will come up with something special for her as
well.;    Fabrics are worth noting for both their luxury factor and color.
Scaasi is liberal with velvet, chiffon and lavish with lace, appliques and
embroidery. His prints include lots of roses, hearts and dots. Colors are
often eye-popping fuchsia, lime, purple, turquoise, orange and, of course,
that shade that is becoming known as "Barbara Blue.";    Carolina Herrera;   
For her 10th-anniversary collection, Herrera sticks with designs that have
brought her success -- smart luncheon outfits, sexy cocktail dresses and
attractive gowns.;    The day dresses, suits and trouser ensembles are mainly
in wool, classic in cut and pretty in unusual shades of pink with a
greenish-brown, gray and cocoa, camel and chocolate and teal and pink. Much
brighter is Herrera's use of her favorite combination of taxi cab yellow and
black -- in houndstooth-check dresses with black velvet cuffs and, for
dressier affairs, houndstooth jackets shot through with metallic threads and
teamed with slinky floor-length, black sequin skirts.;    Like Scaasi and
Blass, Herrera is having a fling with lace, but makes it look fresh by
layering gold lace over navy-and-white lace over black. A feminine look is
found in her ball gowns with velvet bodices and layered organza skirts.;   
Charlotte Neuville;  The former San Franciscan who has made her fashion mark
in New York takes her fall design cues from the streets and the '60s.;   
Ribbed turtlenecks -- reminiscent of '60s "poor boy" tops -- are a key
element, along with leggings paired with short, flippy dresses.;   
Throughout, Neuville accessorizes clothes with what she calls "Homeboy
Pendants" -- large, sequined hearts, stars, crowns and peace symbols worn on
large, long chains. They look to be a good deal lighter than the automobile
hood ornament necklaces that they resemble.;    The evening look to remember
from Neuville is a very simple, short-sleeved, black T-shirt dress made from a
textured, sparkling fabric she calls "Astroturf."  </TEXT>
