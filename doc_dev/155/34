   A judge who said she wanted to keep a
child molester from ``slinking back into the dark'' has ordered the
man to buy a newspaper ad with his picture, an apology and a plea
for others to get help.
   Superior Court Judge Corinne P. Grande gave Stephen
Germershausen, 29, until Friday to buy the 4- by 6-inch ad in The
Providence Journal-Bulletin. The judge on Oct. 26 also placed
Germershausen on 35 years' probation.
   He pleaded guilty to fondling three children, ages 8 to 11, and
sexually assaulting one of them two years ago.
   ``I thought, if he goes to jail, that's good because he'll be
locked up; and while he's locked up, he's not going to hurt anybody
anymore,'' Grande said.
   ``But then I thought, once he got out, he'd go slinking back into
the dark, and no one ever would know what he had done.''
   Grande said ``there doesn't appear to be a sufficient social
response to people like Stephen Germershausen. So I thought about
other children and wondered whether I could use the sentencing
process to effect some change.''
   ``I think that this type of punishment by humiliation is not an
appropriate form of punishment,'' said Stephen Brown, executive
director of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
   Defense attorney Robert B. Mann said that Germershausen had
undergone intensive therapy and that a report suggested he was ``no
longer a threat.''
   Gerhershausen's picture must carry a caption that identifies him
as a child molester and also reads:
   ``If you are a child molester, get professional help immediately
or you may find your picture and name in the paper and your life
under control of the state. This ad is being published by order of
the Superior Court judge who sentenced me.''
   Grande also ordered Germershausen to contribute $1,000 to a
program to help child victims of sexual abuse.
   In Portland, Ore., a judge in 1987 ordered a child molester to
hang a sign on his door warning children to stay away. Judges in
Florida have ordered people convicted of drunken driving to use
bumper stickers announcing their misdeeds.
