When Italy's Gianfranco Ferre showed his first collection for the French house 
of Christian Dior last summer, critics accused him of trying too hard and 
straying toward prissiness. 
</P>
<P>
But his Monday show of spring and summer designs, his first ready-to-wear 
collection for Dior, was more relaxed. There were plenty of flexible separates 
-- smart city pants, shorts, skirts, flouncy chiffon chemises and tight jackets 
in black, white, gray, periwinkle blue, red, violet and vibrant yellow. 
</P>
<P>
His signature -- the bow blouse -- was outsized in organza or taffeta. Some 
were worn off the shoulder, others had black lace cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian designer took traditional Dior trademarks -- ballroom skirts, 
little black dresses, lilies-of-the-valley -- and gave them a contemporary 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Flower-brocaded evening skirts were sheer enough to allow legs to show through. 
Little black dresses were cut from slinky leather, and red taffeta ball gowns 
were cut away in front to reveal narrow black-satin slacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a marriage of Dior and Ferre," the sweat-drenched designer said after 
the show. "I've tried to take the great Dior name and adapt it to contemporary 
life." 
</P>
<P>
"A lovely collection," said designer Paloma Picasso, praising the taffeta 
dresses and stream-lined city slacks. 
</P>
<P>
Notable by her absence from the audience was Princess Caroline of Monaco, a 
devotee of Dior's previous designer, Marc Bohan. Since Bohan was abruptly 
dismissed and replaced by Ferre last spring, the princess has boycotted Dior 
shows. But this time her place was taken by another royal -- Britain's Princess 
Michael of Kent. 
</P>

At Chanel, West German-born designer Karl Lagerfeld presented one of his best 
collections. He led off with transparent chiffon skirts worn under ivory tweed 
jackets. Transparency is a theme in most Paris collections for spring. 
Lagerfeld treated it as one of the several important ingredients for modern 
dress. Others are shorts for all occasions, and bosom wraps. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerfeld played with the jacket form, cutting it into a short bolero, or 
leaving it so long and fitted that it all but covered the flirty miniskirts or 
shorts worn underneath. 
</P>
<P>
He curved the decorative trimming indelibly associated with Chanel into 
geometric designs to outline pockets, hems and necklines. 
</P>
<P>
It was a leggy collection, given an airy feel by the floating chiffon Lagerfeld 
used for his asymmetric skirts and fluttering shorts. Black chiffon dresses 
were scooped and draped at the sides to show the thighs, and the same fabric 
returned in hot pants for evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-born designer Hanae Mori, who was presented with the Legion of Honor 
during this press week, celebrated her 35th year in the industry with a 
particularly young-looking collection. 
</P>
<P>
Short skirts, wide shorts and long flared skirts in striped chiffon made up her 
daytime sportswear. She put her signature -- the butterfly -- on navy linen 
suits and on her iridescent evening wear.
