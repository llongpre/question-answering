<F P=106> [Letter from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editor N. Polezhayeva to </F>
Moscow Prosecutor G.S. Ponomarev: "Witness' Testimony"] 
  [Text] I, Natalya Ivanovna Polezhayeva, chief editor of 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, have received a summons from the Moscow 
prosecutor's office demanding that I appear before investigator 
Leontyeva for questioning as a witness. I know very well I have 
not witnessed any crime and so I naturally asked Mikhail 
Ivanovich Slinko, chief of the department for the investigation 
of banditry, in what connection and on what basis I was being 
summoned. 
  It turned out it was in connection with the 12 April 
publication in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA of the article "Between the 
Criminals and the Bureaucrats.... Who Needed Otari 
Kvantrishvili's Death?" They wanted to find out from me the 
name of the author and the source of the information. 
  I do not think that interrogation is needed for these 
questions. An official request was enough, which had been 
suggested. But M.I. Slinko, citing some article in the Criminal 
Code, promised to draw up a compulsory court attendance order. 
  In order not to waste my own working time nor that of the 
prosecutor's office workers, I have taken the liberty of 
printing my testimony in the newspaper. 
  In accordance with article 41 of the Russian Federation law 
"On the Mass Media," "the editorial office is obliged to keep 
secret its source of information and does not have the right to 
name a person supplying information on condition he is not 
named, except for a case when relevant demand has come from a 
court in connection with a case with which it is dealing." 
  In this case the author made anonymity a condition for the 
purposes of his own safety. In this connection I cannot give 
the author's name or the source of the information. But I 
assure you it was obtained from officials of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and the editorial office has no doubts about it. 
  [signed] Witness N. Polezhayeva
