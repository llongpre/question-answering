   Sheer elegance at Chanel for next winter won
designer Karl Lagerfeld a roar of applause in his Monday
ready-to-wear show.
   The great choices in short or long skirts and pants were welcome
for Chanel fans, sometimes disappointed with Lagerfeld's recent
creative eccentricities.
   His sportier looks were based on glen plaid or tweed blazers
with lean skirts or pants, often topped with short fencers' capes.
   With feathered hats, it was vaguely Tyrolian, although there
were lots of familiar Chanel chain belts and buttons used
discreetly throughout. Gold buttons were de rigueur down the arms
and jackets of most suits.
   As a change from the familiar and much-copied chain and quilt
Chanel shoulder bag, there's a new model in bright red and green
plaids.
   One of the best jackets here was narrowed at the waist, had
curved lounging-jacket lapels, patch pockets with a pleat and came
in bright red, green or navy. It topped a swingy, pleated gray
skirt or pants.
   The trouser suits for day were in muted browns, grays or greens,
cutest with a nipped plaid bolero. Also in the Tyrolean vein were
the long or short gathered bold plaid skirts, dressiest when topped
with a clinging black sweater with lace yoke.
   There were blouses galore for all the easy pants, most often in
white Georgette silk crepe with pierrot, double-pleated ruffles and
wide flounced necklines.
   The longer suits _ often in navy or black _ were strictly lean,
but moved well. And in black velvet they had lovely touches of
double knit rows of ruffles or embroidered flowers, big and small.
   The fluid evening satin pyjamas with belted tunic tops in
searing colors could be sure-fire classic winners.
   Knits were super too, remarkable in ivory cable-knit cardigans
over gorgeous draped chiffon dinner dresses. In spite of some
peppy, full, bright skirts with lace, ribbons, crinolines and busy
tops, the overall statement was totally wearable chic.
   Kenzo's show was a cheery ode to fall. He too showed all lengths
with some Medieval-Renaissance touches. His best red suit with a
skirt just above the knee had an interesting sleeve puffed out
below the dropped shoulder.
   Kenzo's pants suits were lean and pin-striped for dandies, black
``smokings'' a la George Sand or had a Medieval look with page-boy
knickers, often with capes in rust or olive colors and sometimes
with big silk scarves with Renaissance portraits.
   Other graceful touches were in the colorful tweed and flowered
velvet fitted suits, again skirts mini to long. There was a lovely
``skyline'' inspired group of light challis wool and chiffon
dresses printed with puffy clouds.
   Maryll Lanvin's versatile approach featured well-cut clothes in
good fabrics. They looked young, but could be worn by any age.
   Lots of pants worked fine, especially topped by fitted, checked
cropped jackets or tiny boleros in autumn colors.
   Also remarkable were her short suits with very long jackets in
windowpane-checked bright yellow or royal blue. Other suits came
out in more subtle gray, tan or brick shades with full peplums on
the jackets.
   The best coat in hot tones of orange, fuschia and emerald turned
up in an egg shape and was worn with a neat piped suit underneath _
in a different sizzling shade.
   Cocktail looks turned elaborate, with drapes and puffs and
dazzling colors. They exuded a faint air of Ungaro, but were less
showy than his exaggerations.
   A safe but appealing party choice would be the romantic white
ruffled Victorian blouses over black draped silk sheaths.
   Paisley turned up here as all over the Paris shows, in soft,
full-skirted day dresses or as big borders on flounced black
numbers, or dresses with pointed handkerchief-panel skirts. And the
velvet paisley lounging pyjama suit was best of all.
   Sonia Rykiel, often best at her own familiar tunes, classic
knits, branched out at her winter show into quilted tops and suits
that were so puffy they made the wearer look like the Michelin man.
   But she had some excellent suits. An amethyst or flame short
knit suit with the jacket bowed in back had the Rykiel chic. And
her fitted caviar or houndstooth spencer suits were timely and
handsome, as were the graceful dark or tan solid-color suits,
nearly ankle-length.
   Evenings at Rykiel are best in the slinky, long black outfits
with sparkly details. Striped taffetas with big V-shaped panels in
front and full skirts in silvery grays lacked Rykiel's light touch
and ended up on the too-prim side of heavy Victorian.
