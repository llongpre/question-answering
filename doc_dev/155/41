   Extravagant was the name of the game Monday as
couturiers took a trip to dreamland in their winter shows.
   With the bicentennial of the French Revolution, designers seem
intent on bringing back clothes fit for a queen.
   The biggest news was at Dior, as the Italian couturier
Gianfranco Ferre nearly brought down the tent in an outdoor show at
the gardens of the Salomon-Rothschild Foundation. Ferre, named in
May to replace Marc Bohan, was chosen to add excitement to the
world's most prestigious label.
   Ferre obviously made the grade, with his opulent collection of
fitted clothes that led off with a waist-cinching fitted black
crepe redingote topped with a stovepipe hat. He finally wound up in
a Dioresque whirl of strapless ball gowns with tulle petticoats,
wrapped sable stoles and jackets, plus huge organza bows, and
bouquets of lily of the valley _ a favorite at Dior.
   Ferre managed to combine all the sumptuous fabrics and furs in
rigorously constructed clothes that looked both retrospective and
beautifully modern. He did a marvelous job of making red or pearl
gray persian lamb look like embroidered lace on a sexy strapless
sheath evening gown. He made fitted suits of creamy-beige ostrich
leather look soft and feminine.
   Ferre showed skirt lengths flatteringly around midknee for
daytime _ or opted for dressy trousers above the ankle.
   Arms were slim under shoulders with a whisper of padding for
shape. Whether caped ball gowns, satin trousers or tweed suits in
bold herringbones with sparkly sequins, the Dior line looked fit to
win.
   Hem lengths were irrelevant in most of the dazzling parades of
lucre.
   ``It's a trip abroad, a dream,'' said Jean-Louis Scherrer who
decked out his daughter and favorite model Laetitia like a
glamorous toy soldier, complete with gold tasseled epaulets and
braid-edged cap.
   Scherrer also was on the road to India, which he trod a few
years ago. This time, it was richer than ever, with lame-shot sari
silks and chiffons, galloon-edged boleros, rich shades of panne
velvet and Persian embroideries worn with silk and gold lame
turbans.
   ``You could wear this with jeans,'' said Scherrer, gesturing to
a richly braided military jacket with gold frog buttons.
   Chocolate is hot for next winter, and Scherrer went all out for
the browns, jazzing them up with shades of red from flame and coral
to cyclamen, plus some peacock and royal blue.
   Balmain's designer Erik Mortensen also used prodigious amounts
of expensive fabrics in a successful extravaganza. The man who
practically reinvented shorts for couture went in for a
pedal-pusher pants, making them extraordinarily beautiful with
their toppers of bright teal blue, pistachio or flame-flared
jackets with bold buttons and funnel collars.
   Mortensen pulled off a clever trick by covering bodies with full
tent-like shapes, then baring legs clad in tights with gold Persian
embroidery up the sides. Among the memorable coats were the
gray-black-white pyramids in mohair and Mongolian goat, and the
red-and-green lacy models tufted with marabout or ostrich _ fun but
not very warm.
   The gold, copper and lame stiffened silk dresses stiffened like
thin sheets of metal were draped perfectly, slit up the leg for
walking. But they also dragged fishtail-trains, better for standing
around than circulating at a cocktail party.
   But even with piling on fabrics, stiff ruffles and sparkling
details, Mortensen made it all look floaty and light.
   Pierre Cardin got an enthusiastic hand for his winter
collection, which sparkled with enough titillating geometric
details to evoke his old magic.
   He obviously was tired of short skirts, showing very few. He
preferred a midcalf narrow skirt, or else simply no skirt at all
just a long jacket over tights, or slightly flared pants.
   Shoulders were natural or eclipsed by important collars, always
a strong point with Cardin, who knows how to play with shapes like
a kid with cutouts.
   The coats often had kimono or handkerchief sleeves, and some had
tiered skirts under a narrow bust.
   The favorite waistline was dropped to the hip, emphasized by a
narrow leather belt, the coat gathered like a ruffle beneath it.
   The fun popped up in high-collared short coats edged at the
armhole in fake fur or Mongolian lamb, in leather-banded sleeveless
sweater-coats, or in caped poncho looks.
   Evening wear by Andre Oliver was just as rich. Using stiffened
hoops and pleats _ the basic Cardin shapes _ Oliver sculpted some
dashing ladies of the night in Chantilly lace, fuschia and
pistachio taffeta, diaphanous chiffon.
   And they were topped by funny hats _ the favorite ones a pillbox
big as a hatbox, wrapped in satin ribbon, and a mortarboard tied
with a scarf.
