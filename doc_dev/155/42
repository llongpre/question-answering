The Scene: Mega-bash Thursday night for "Total Recall," a Tri-Star release that 
promises to be boffo at the box office. After a packed screening at the 
Hollywood Pacific (where, outside, fans chanted, "Ah-nald! Ah-nald!" when 
"Total Recall" star Schwarzenegger arrived), Columbia hosted a party at 
Griffith Observatory, where guests were treated to laser shows, dancing, 
psychics, tarot card and palm readers and a great view of L.A. from the roof. 
Guests could gaze at the grid and privately hope that, someday, all that would 
be theirs.

The Buzz: Ronny Cox, one of the film's co-stars, summed it up when he excitedly 
said to a friend, "I think the buzz on this is good." While some seemed alarmed 
by the film's screechy noise level, spurting blood and high body count, most 
seemed sure it would bring in audiences -- even if they have to pay the new 
inflated ticket price of $7.50 at some theaters.

Who Was There: Schwarzenegger, with his wife, Maria Shriver, and his mother, 
Aurelia; director Paul Verhoeven, co-stars Michael Ironside, Rachel Ticotin and 
Sharon Stone; plus Mimi Rogers, Grace Jones, Paul Michael Glaser, Debbie Allen, 
Jack and Elaine LaLanne, Mr. T, Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern, Pat Riley, Tony 
Danza, Pierce Brosnan, Wayne Gretzky and wife Janet Jones, Michael Nouri, Ivan 
Reitman, Sandra Bernhard, Robert Davi, Lou Ferrigno, Julian Sands, Esai 
Morales, Timothy and Barbara Leary, and Sondra Locke.

Dress Mode: Standouts in the mostly business-suited crowd included Mr. T's neon 
graffiti-printed shorts and jacket accessorized with his usual colossal 
collection of gold chains; Grace Jones' slinky grape-colored dress and 
painted-on eyebrows; Debbie Allen's hot-pink satin pouf jacket; Jack LaLanne's 
red and black pin-striped suit; Wayne Gretzky's stubble, and Mimi Rogers' 
tailored jacket over low-cut T-shirt.

Chow: Along Came Mary fed the hungry troops buffet-style, with mini-hamburgers, 
onion rings, pizza, scallop skewers, baby racks of lamb, and sundaes, cookies 
and brownies.

Quoted: Who is Schwarzenegger's toughest critic? His mother, of course. But not 
to worry -- "She loved it," he said. "I always ask her what she thinks. She 
thought the action was great, all the futuristic things."

Overheard: "I knew I needed earplugs for the Roxy, but I didn't think I'd need 
to bring them to a movie," said one woman whose ears were still ringing an hour 
after the movie had ended.

<P>
A Movie by Any Other Name . . .: One industry wag has already re-dubbed the 
film, "Like, I Recall -- Totally!" 
</P>
<P>
OK, but Is There Going to Be a Total Recall II?: Not directed by Verhoeven, it 
seems. "I don't think I could do this again," he admitted. "I'd get kind of 
bored, probably."
