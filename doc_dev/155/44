<LEADPARA>  MOUNTAIN LIONS are moving into man's territory -- they are wandering onto back
porches to make a meal of the family pet or into the farm yard to sample local
mutton, beef or chickens.;    The latest attack was in Glendora, in Southern
California, when an ailing mountain lion killed a pet Doberman pinscher
Sunday. The cougar was later shot and killed by animal-control officers when
it returned to feed on the body of the dog. The cougar was in poor health,
with fleas, ticks and tumors on its body.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     More people have been attacked and killed by mountain lions in the past 10
years than in the previous 50, according to an article in the current issue of
Sports Afield, surprising naturalists who had long branded them recluses that
would rather slink away than confront a man.;    There are more humans in lion
habitat and more lions in human habitat than at any other time in this
century, according to researchers.;    Lee Fitzhugh, extension wildlife
specialist at the University of California in Davis, described the California
circumstances this way:;    "More and more people are moving into rural
situations. At the same time, there's been a significant build-up of our
mountain lion population. This build-up forces inexperienced, young animals
out of the remote areas which are already filled with older, established
mountain lions, and out into settled areas.";    Fitzhugh went on to say: "In
the last couple of months we've had cougar sightings on the University of
California-Davis campus. A radio-collared female in a mountain lion study unit
east of Fresno wandered 270 miles north and was captured in town.";    (In
California, Proposition 117 was passed in 1990, banning hunting of mountain
lions. Actually, there has been no season on mountain lions in the state since
1984.);    Gary Power, a biologist with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game,
described an incident in which a clerk in a rural convenience store heard a
noise and looked up to see a young cougar padding silently out of the store
with her puppy clenched in its jaws.;    Kathy Green, a biologist with the
Colorado Division of Wildlife, reported cougars on the patios of Boulder
hospitals, cougars flattened on highways near Denver, cougars chasing joggers
up trees.;    "It just seems like there's cats everywhere," she said.;    Two
of them backed a woman jogger up a tree last summer and climbed after her
until she whacked them over the head. Last January, a young male cougar killed
an 18-year-old student jogging behind his Idaho Springs, Colo., high school.; 
  Mike Aderhold of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, blamed
Montana's recent lion problem on the high deer population. Deer is a cougar's
natural prey.;    "People who lure deer to their property with salt blocks and
feed also pull in their predators," he said.;    The mountain lion or cougar
-- also called puma, panther, painter, catamount or, properly, Felix concolor
-- roams 20,000 to 30,000 strong west of the Mississippi River and eats every
animal from skunks to moose, with deer-sized mammals as its principal prey.;  
 Silent, furtive, once called the Ghosts of North America, the cougar has been
known to kill and drag off 600-pound cattle. Pioneers 300 years ago described
its "woman-like scream.";    Many today fear the big cats are becoming a
menace to human life as they saunter into cities and towns.;    Hunters fear a
growing lion population will kill too many deer and elk. They favor controlled
sport hunting of cougars to relieve the pressure on game herds, reduce
livestock depredation and attacks on humans, at the same time raising money
for cougar management without jeopardizing western cougar populations.;   
This idea is violently rejected by a large contingent of westerners who see
the tawny cats as magnificent predators that have been unjustly persecuted for
decades and now are threatened with imminent extinction.  </TEXT>
