A charity fashion show featuring chic cocktail dresses and gowns seemed the 
perfect place to find out what cogent comments women have about the current 
state of evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find clothes within a certain price category," one woman said 
emphatically. "You can find them for $300 and $3,000, but that in-between price 
is hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for something that when I walk into a room every one of us doesn't 
have on the same outfit," said another. 
</P>
<P>
The women were surveyed during the John Wayne Cancer Clinic (at UCLA) 
Auxiliary's annual membership luncheon/fashion show/fund-raiser Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
This group of supporters (99% were women) gathered in the ballroom of the 
Regent Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills to view the 1990 Neiman Marcus gown 
collection in a runway show titled "A Little Night Magic," produced by David 
Cardoza. Body-hugging evening wear by Vicky Tiel, Bob Mackie's trademark glitzy 
sequins and Isabelle Allard's slinky black lace gowns were paraded down the 
runway by models in the highest heels and Bardot hair. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the 550 women present spoke plainly about the lack of affordable, 
elegant evening wear needed to maneuver through the upcoming hectic social 
season in style. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm offended when I go into Chanel and somebody tells me that the jacket's 
$3,000 and the skirt's another $1,600. I'm not going to buy it," said Gretchen 
Wayne, wife of Michael Wayne and a member of the auxiliary's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you should be able to dress well and not look like everybody else. We 
need to have better quality in the clothing too, at a price that's within 
reason for the people who are shopping. I'm not shy about spending money at 
all, but I don't want to wear something that looks like a uniform. Otherwise 
I'll go back to wearing my high school uniform." 
</P>
<P>
"Every year the John Wayne Cancer Clinic has a benefactor's event in December, 
and I'll be needing a gown for that, and one for our auxiliary's major 
fund-raiser in April," said Jackie Banchik, president of the auxiliary, who 
wore a white pique suit with gold embroidery. "If I don't start looking now, 
forget it. Because I'm small, it's hard for me to find things." 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Lubin and Elaine Lerman, co-chairs of the luncheon, were pinning their 
hopes on New York designer Pamela Dennis, whose cocktail dresses and gowns were 
featured in the show. 
</P>
<P>
"We can wear her clothes," said Lubin. "They're great for women in their 50s." 
</P>
<P>
"She has the freshest, most wonderful look of any new designer I've seen," 
added Lerman. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, 30, who came to the show, said she never designs a collection without 
listening to her customers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I do a lot of trunk shows," she said, "and I do listen to these women. I'm not 
just in this to make things that sit on a rack. They tell me they want to look 
classy but sexy at the same time. She really wants her husband to say, 'Wow!' I 
mean, that's what I want." 
</P>
<P>
But not all the talk at the luncheon was about clothes. Celebrity host Jill 
Eikenberry (there with husband Michael Tucker) spoke of her battle with breast 
cancer and stressed the need for support and care of anyone faced with the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
So did honorary chairwoman Susan Dobson, who told of her mother's bout with 
pancreatic cancer that doctors told her would take her life in three to six 
months. She then introduced her healthy mother to the crowd to wild applause. 
</P>
<P>
Other guests were Michele Lee and Joan Van Ark; Joyce Green, executive director 
of the clinic; and more Wayne clan members, including Michael Wayne, Toni Wayne 
LaCava and Melinda Wayne Munoz. Dr. Donald L. Morton, chief of the cancer 
clinic, was presented with a check for $360,000, representing the money raised 
last year from the auxiliary's events.
