   Christian Lacroix woke up the fashion crowd Sunday
with his show of bright, peppy clothes in ready-to-wear and
``luxe'' versions for the 1990 summer season.
   Both lines showed some leggy looks, long pants and Lacroix's
curvy cuts. ``Luxe'' was simply richer than ready-to-wear, and will
cost a few thousand dollars more per outfit.
   In both shows, he included some of his oval skirts and fitted
jackets, plus a few of his famous fichu collars and trapeze-line
coats and dresses. Pants ranged from full and cropped to
``cigarette'' slim, under tunic tops and dressy jackets.
   The slightly simplified, sportier ready-to-wear lines led off
with a blue drawstring parka over narrow madras plaid pants, and
color burst out from there on _ often with Lacroix's ebullient
mixes of flowers, checks, plaids.
   It was a sunny, summery collection of high spirits by the young
creator from the sunny south of France, showing sunhats and
beachwear galore this time.
   While many designers were bringing out lots of rusty, even muddy
autumn colors, Lacroix went out for a fresh palette of pinks, reds,
violet, pistachio and chartreuse, in clothes that often came out
looking younger than springtime.
   His fitted suits of huge houndstooth checks came out in
turquoise or chartreuse and black for a striking city look. But the
daisy-printed floral Provencal cotton jackets paired with full
short skirts in a different print were happy-go-lucky Lacroix at
his best.
   He showed a lot of leg in the bloomer shorts or skirts and
bright pistachio or pink linen jackets with big jeweled collars.
   Lacroix's simplest line involved delicate mixes of pastel
twinsets and chocolate brown pleated skirts or straight pants. The
pearl-buttoned knit toppers had puffed organza sleeves rimmed in
gold.
   While some of the brightest patchworks with heart and star print
motifs came out in trapeze-line dresses, much of the collection was
based on sexy bustier tops, especially in multicolored lame brocade
cocktail dresses.
   The ``luxe'' clothes were sometimes dolled up with so much lace
and glitz that the chic was nearly hidden. But there were also some
fabulous clothes in this near-couture line.
   Some of the sweetness nearly got out of hand in this show _ with
the sequined, pink or blue taffeta-ruffled, lace-edged wraparound
dresses _ as the loudspeaker warbled ``May Time,'' by Jeannette
MacDonald.
   Even the ``tiger ladies'' in their chiffon animal prints looked
more innocent than wild, though one was a clinging, ruffled and
gathered number to outline an hourglass figure.
   The chiffons ranged from nice navy numbers with ``godet''
flounces at the knee-length hem for dancing, to some wonderful pink
and raspberry flower prints draped with a big scarf fastened with
an outsized rose at the shoulder.
   Black lace, navy pleated chiffon and sparkling embroidery on
short dresses and pajama outfits topped by tunics ended up this
show that offered the ultimate in dressy summer wear.
   Luxury in a totally different vein was laid on with heavier
brush strokes by Romeo Gigli in his second Paris show.
   Currently the darling of the fashion world, Gigli, 39, prefers
the madcap Paris fashion whirl to his native Italy for showing his
clothes. After last spring's hit show, this second offering was
played to a packed, enthusiastic house.
   It was a case where the clothes wore the women. Models minced
down the runway looking barely able to walk, constrained by silky,
gossamer shoulder wraps, puffed tutu-skirt effects over lean silk
trousers worn with colored tights and flat sandals.
   The outfits were treated as artwork. They ranged between
Byzantine and Oriental opulence, with the most dazzling iridescent
silks, lace, velvet, gold-threaded sheer fabrics often in the burnt
colors of autumn.
   It was like looking at a series of paintings rather than clothes
to wear to a party. Full, stiffened tent-like shortie coats over
figured pants had the look of hieratic characters in a Byzantine
mosaic, especially with the flowing pearled earrings bigger than
chandeliers draped over the shoulders.
   But Gigli can cut, and his slim iridescent or metallic lame silk
tail-coats looked wonderful over slim pants.
   Martine Sitbon brought out dozens of sailor suits, a couple of
Batman types in body stockings and capes and a few cowgirl styles.
At the opposite end of the spectrum from Gigli, Sitbon showed peppy
clothes that were mainly for the young.
   In tones of navy or rust linen, the seagoing set was decked out
in vests and middy collars or battle jackets with striped shirts up
top. Below decks it was short corsair or long bell-bottomed
trousers _ and a perky shorts-jumpsuit for good measure.
