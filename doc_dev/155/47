   Christian Lacroix kicked off a week of haute
couture shows for winter Sunday with plenty of luxury and an
about-face in style, abandoning the short pouf skirts that made him
famous and presenting a variety of styles.
   His show received politely enthusiastic response from the buyers
and press, but there was no screaming ovation, as there was at last
year's.
   Some found the show rather confusing, as if Lacroix didn't
always know what to do with all that lovely fabric. In clothes
aimed at opulence, the effect was sometimes perfect, sometimes
awkward or heavy-looking.
   But most agreed these clothes look much more wearable than the
past _ even though couture is only worn by a handful of women who
pay astronomical prices, well up in the thousands of dollars, for a
simple dress.
   Lacroix kept his sense of fun in bright miniskirts with full
paisley overskirts, worn with jeweled suede boots and an oversized
hat.
   His new suit looks varied. One red model with a long jacket and
short skirt was a dead ringer for the Chanel style. Another is the
short-long effect with the billowing overskirt to offset a shorter
skirt underneath.
   The full pantskirts or flowing pajamas were sometimes given a
buttoned-up, high-waisted sailor suit look, dressed up with mink
capes or fox jackets. Cowl hoods and draped fichu collars are still
Lacroix trademarks.
   The great invention of the collection was a tuxedo. It came out
as a smashing dark crepe jumpsuit with big rhinestone buttons,
large white satin lapels and cuffs on the jacket.
   The evening gowns were varied and elaborate, with brown in
brocades, chiffons and velvet a big favorite. But Lacroix juggled
his palette throughout the show, alternating combinations of hot
colors with softly graded combinations.
   A midnight blue velvet sheath with its topping of a puffy bow
and train of many-hued brown, blue and grey tulle was a knockout.
   Following the Lacroix show was the evening wear at Hanae Mori's
show.
   Each carefully made black-gray-white model drifted out painted
or decorated with seagulls and waves, birds, butterflies and trees.
Dresses featured large leaf patterns and trim.
   Mrs. Mori showed a wearable collection of outfits that showed
the knee, emphasized intricate draping and detail and brought out
some flyaway toppers, shorter in the front.
