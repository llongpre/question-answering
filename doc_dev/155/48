<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "In the Corridors of </F>
Power": "It Is a Dark Night in the Russian Federation Procuracy"] 
  [Text] After the unexpected resignation of A. 
Kazannik, Aleksey Ilyushenko was appointed acting general 
procurator of the Russian Federation. His name is linked in the 
mind of many people with the so-called "Rutskoy case." Let us 
recall that the case went into high gear along with the 
intensification of the political crisis and involved charges of 
corruption against the former vice president. It was alleged 
that he had something to do with foreign currency accounts in 
Switzerland, as well as ownership of the Trade Links company. 
But is it legitimate to assume that A. Ilyushenko's appointment 
is associated only with the "Rutskoy case"? 
  This is what we have been able to find out in the 
general procuracy from various sources, since A. Ilyushenko 
himself refrains from comment. 
  On the eve of the elections and referendum on 12 December, 
the Moscow procuracy closed the corruption case against A. 
Rutskoy. Note that public comments on this event came from 
investigator M. Slinko instead of Moscow Procurator G. 
Ponomarev, who chose to remain silent. Then the "case" went for 
review by the General Procuracy-- the sphere of supervision of 
A. Kazannik (whose principled stance we all seemed to have seen 
proof of). After that, three top specialists independently come 
to the conclusion that "...the decision to close the criminal 
case regarding A. Rutskoy should be revoked... The General 
Procuracy should be tasked with further investigation of the 
criminal case by reason of the scale of the criminal case and a 
large number of questions requiring establishment of contacts on 
a federal level. I. Bobrovskiy, the general procurator's 
assistant for special tasks." 31 January 1994. 
  This document, as well as a number of others, prompted A. 
Kazannik to speak up at the General Procuracy collegium at the 
end of February. "Three of our best specialists, for the purpose 
of ensuring legitimacy, studied the materials independently of 
one another. All of them came to the conclusion that the Moscow 
City Procuracy did not answer a single question. In addition, 
the investigation had been conducted with gross violations of 
the norms of criminal law, in particular, Article 67 of the 
Russian Federation Criminal Process Code... Moscow investigators 
are threatening to charge persons who have handed over documents 
with slander. I am not sure, however, who should be charged 
under Article 130 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code." 
  The aforementioned Moscow procuracy investigators were not 
present at the collegium. Moscow Procurator G. Ponomarev, 
however, was present and sat in the presidium. He, however, 
remains silent to this day. The man who is still talking is the 
same M. Slinko, with respect to whom the principled A. Kazannik 
had his doubts. 
  All in all, after a number of meetings with procuracy staff 
one gets the impression that the procuracy, torn apart by 
politicians, is now completely demoralized. Despite the experts' 
conclusion and A. Kazannik's statement, six volumes of the 
"Rutskoy case" ended up in the General Procuracy, and another 10 
volumes--in the Moscow City Procuracy... There is every reason 
to believe, however, that the conclusions of A. Kazannik's 
commission will indeed prevail and "the case of A. Rutskoy's 
trust" will be brought to a logical conclusion. In any case, 
Canadian notary public Chapnik, who continues to maintain that 
he had notarized genuine documents with a genuine signature, is 
at this point well and alive. Besides, it is possible that after 
the conversation with Russian investigators, Chapnik himself 
will come under charges of perjury. Then he will face criminal 
prosecution in Canada.
