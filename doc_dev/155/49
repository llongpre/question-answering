Preview '89 show last week at the Irvine Hilton and Towers featured such 
offerings as a Patrick Kelly body-conscious stretch velour dress, left; a 
sporty Gianfranco Ferre ensemble of gray flannel slacks topped with a charmeuse 
shirt and coat trimmed in stenciled fox, center, and a slinky and simple sequin 
number by Stephen Yearick. The show raised $25,560 for the Junior League of 
Orange County. Nordstrom annually presents its fall fashion forecast to benefit 
a local charity. RICK PERRY / Los Angeles Times
