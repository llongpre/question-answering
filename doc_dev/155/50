   Fashion was a high-style spectacle last week as
couture designers unveiled their extravagant clothes in opulent
fabrics for winter of 1989-90.
   The idea this season is sexy rather than power dressing.
   Most couturiers have backed off from the big padded shoulder
after Christian Lacroix led the way two seasons ago. But Saint
Laurent and Givenchy still believe that padding gives the right
shape to suit jackets.
   Skirt lengths are irrelevant. The many knee-baring skirts still
look appealing for those with good legs, especially when the skirts
are given the tulip-wrap treatment. But some longer lengths looked
fine too, at influential houses like Saint Laurent and Chanel.
   There was a lot of ``retro'' around, not least at the house of
Dior, where the Italian designer, Gianfranco Ferre, took a look at
the first Dior New Look of 1947 and whipped up his own version.
   Although a newcomer to the Paris shows, Ferre won the season's
top couture prize, the Golden Thimble, for his beautifully
constructed clothes that had dashes of daring, such as the sequined
chevron-tweed suits.
   Ferre's Dior evening wear showed huge organza bows at the neck,
the strapless and wasp-waisted dresses with stiffened tulle
underskirts, plus ornamental bouquets of lilies of the valley.
   Some customers didn't buy all of Ferre's ideas. A Texan who has
her own mannequin for fittings at Dior said, ``No way I'd buy those
complicated clothes. They're too bulky for packing.''
   Another Italian, Gianni Versace, had the last word of the week,
placing his ``atelier'' couture models on headless mannequins in
the Jacquemart-Andre Museum. The party was attended by several
celebrities, including Joan Collins, dressed in form-fitting ruby
satin, Marisa Berenson in a bead-embroidered Versace tunic and
Isabelle Huppert in an easy-fitted beige silk dress.
   Christian Lacroix's offhand mixing of fabrics in his short
fitted suits and big accessories showed him in good form, though
some observers thought this was not his best collection.
   Saint Laurent's fans were glad to know that he kept his daytime
wear strictly conservative, with a sharply-tailored silhouette,
long or bolero jackets with padded shoulders, a few blousons and
several flowing capes.
   Most of Saint Laurent's evening wear had a true touch of magic.
His flower-shaped short evening dresses in brocade lames were truly
fabulous, with their stiffened wing-like collars and skirt wraps.
   Karl Lagerfeld's riding jacket for Chanel stole the show.
   The most memorable outfit in this curvaceous line was the
decollete off-the-shoulder outsized houndstooth-check jacket, worn
with a wispy chiffon skirt.
   Chanel and virtually everyone else in Paris showed fabulous lame
``damasked'' fabrics and brocades, along with frothy dollops of
Chantilly lace and embroidered tulle, satin and chiffon. But rich
velvets and taffetas and faille turned up as well.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer interpreted evening wear as a dazzling magic
carpet of shimmering fabrics in fitted short suits, long gowns and
tunics with pants for a thousand and one nights of rich revelry on
the exotic road to India.
   The hot new color to remember this fall will be chocolate _
dark, milky or pinkish like cinnamon. And it gets mixed in with
shades like coral or aqua to lighten things up. Pearly grays at
Dior looked superb.
   While it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce and
show most these couture collections _ and only a few women can
afford the outfits costing well upwards of $10,000 _ couture is
considered useful.
   The showy clothes serve as prototypes for luxury ready-to-wear,
and they give a house and its designer an image and reputation to
fuel sales of everything from accessories to makeup and perfume.
