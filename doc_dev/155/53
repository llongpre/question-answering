formal fashion show at the Silicon Valley Capital Club.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Creative, innovative clothing was the order of the evening both on and off
the runway as some 200 style-conscious men and women watched community members
model the designs of 14 local clothing and accessories designers.;   "It was
wonderful and long overdue," said Janet Bucknam, one of those who paid $50 to
sip wine and munch hors d'oeuvres at the benefit for the Santa Clara County
Children's Shelter.;   The lucky 13;   The formal show was divided into 13
segments, starting with Renaissance costumes designed by Joyce Falsken and
ending with a black cape appliqued with human figures and colorful abstract
designs by R/S Avalos. In-between, each designer had a separate segment.;  
Here's a rundown of what the Silicon Valley designers were showing:;   (check)
G.K. Moll's trademark is the use of antique kimono fabric as insets into suits
and dresses. A few pieces would work in an executive board room, but most are
more likely to show up at chic dinner parties and dances. One particularly
stunning dress is a long black columnar gown, with a gold and white kimono
fabric applique running down the left side.;   (check) Thalia Stratton, best
known for her fashion illustrations, used neckties, cummerbunds and jackets as
canvases for her work. She painted a "Stardust" theme with stars sprinkled on
the front of a tuxedo jacket and a woman in a long, red gown dancing with her
formally dressed partner on the back of the jacket. Created for Nina Boyd, one
of her fellow founders of the Designers Circle, the jacket belonged to Boyd's
late husband Chuck and commemorated their meeting and romance.;   (check) A.
J. Cave gave menswear a small presence with dark double-breasted jackets
paired with pleated pants, black jackets with suede insets and a bright red
duster coat.;   (check) Beverly Gold revived tie-dye prints into vivid color
combinations of pink, aqua and lime. One outfit that looked both attractive
and comfy combined tie-dye crushed velvet leggings, top and jacket.;  
Vietnamese influence;   (check) Yenchi Nguyen, invited to participate as a
representative of the fashion program offered at Evergreen Valley College,
started off with a grouping of pristine white and gold cocktail dresses and
gowns, including one styled like an ao dai from her native Vietnam. She also
showed a splash of color with gowns featuring her hand-painted designs.;  
(check) Kayla Kennington's designs showed off her skill at creative original
fabrics by dyeing and discharging color into and out of silk. One top had
collar-like layers of silk in burned earth tones of orange and yellow. Most
stunning was a wedding gown that incorporates the colors of an autumn
vineyard, with overlays of gold embroidery. Few in the audience realized that
the artist plans to work on it even more.;   (check) Tina Thuy-Nga Munson,
invited as a representative of the fashion program at West Valley College,
showed a variety of styles, including a slinky jumpsuit with long, black
fringe hanging from the waist down, a striking black and gold checkerboard
patterned tunic vest and a series of sari gowns, including one with smocked
side panels.;   (check) Karla Hour's designs combined style and whimsy. A
bright orange and gold dress had fringed epaulets that jutted out from the
sides of the shoulder rather than sitting on top as they usually do. Another
cocktail dress combined white-dyed fish scales with chiffon and a fringe of
glass beads hanging from the hem that lightly tinkled as the model walked.;  
Pricey 'ice';   (check) Marian Clayden, the one nationally known participant,
whose creations sell at Bergdorf Goodman in New York, showed her own talents
at both fabric and dress design with a series of chiffons, cut silk and
velvets, some with lace overlays. All looked simply beautiful. One pretty
dress and jacket in what Clayden calls "blue ice" retails at $1,660 for each
piece.;   Jewelry by Sheila Sabatino, Doris Taborelli and Dezi Thomas were
used as accessories. Sabatino, who chaired the show, also created some hats.; 
 Community members modeling the designs added to the festive atmosphere of the
evening, which started off with wine and hors d'oeuvres, and guests admiring
the lights of San Jose 17 stories below the Capital Club.;   Rookie models;  
Among those who took lessons from Kiki Peters of Flair Modeling and Finishing
School for the show were Beverly Hayes, Mary Ellen and Michael Fox, Paulette
and Gerry Beemiller, Karen and Walter Loewenstern and Alice and Douglas
McLendon. Television anchor Jan Hutchins and radio personality John McLeod
acted as masters of ceremony.;   After the show, some women stopped to buy
clothes and accessories, looking toward upcoming holiday parties, or to pick
up business cards from the designers. Accessories started at $50 and outfits
at $200.;   Moll said she sold a black velvet evening suit for $630 and took
an order on a coat for $670. Kennington said she had appointments to meet
interested people later this week.;   Karen Loewenstern, who bought Moll's
suit, said she didn't buy the Clayden design she modeled, but has ordered
$5,000 worth of other pieces from the Los Gatos-based designer. Loewenstern is
planning to save one outfit to wear to the April 4 "Anna Karenina Ball"
benefiting the San Jose Cleveland Ballet, a group she founded.;   The
Designers Circle grew out of conversation at a midsummer luncheon hosted by
Boyd and attended by Sabatino, Stratton and Hayes. The four formed a
committee, chaired by Sabatino who selected designers she had worked with
prior to closing her wearable art boutique.;   Many women in the audience
seemed to be appreciative of this new fashion forum. "I like the idea of
supporting local designers," Gloria Citti said. "It's very exciting.";  
Artist Patti Henry said, "I loved the fantasy things. . . . Some were rich
beyond rich, where you can stay and look forever and ever.";   Around 9:30
p.m., as designers were gathering up clothes, Nguyen turned to Sabatino and
asked, "Are we going to do it again?";   The answer was yes.; IFYOU'RE

list for the next Designers Circle of the Valley fashion event, call Sheila
Sabatino at (408) 265-9024. Some of the designers' work is carried at R/S
