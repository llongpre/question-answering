<LEADPARA>  SONGS are to the movies what hood ornaments are to cars: They add a certain
luster to the finished product, but they are hardly as important as the nuts
and bolts that hold the contraption together.;    In fact, it could be argued
that the only rationale for having "Original Song" as an Oscar category is to
provide a few musical moments in the event itself. The performances of the
songs are what make the Oscars a show, not just an awards ceremony.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That said, it must also be noted that two of the original songs in this
year's Oscar competition remind us that movie songs can also be good songs,
period.;    The others prove only that movie people are as capable of making
dismal music as, well, music people.;    Obvious 'movie song';  The nominees
are: "Blaze of Glory" from "Young Guns II"; "I'm Checkin' Out" from "Postcards
From the Edge"; "Promise Me You'll Remember" from "The Godfather Part III";
"Somewhere in My Memory" from "Home Alone"; and "Sooner or Later" from "Dick
Tracy.";    The most obvious "movie song" in this bunch is "Promise Me You'll
Remember," one of those ravishing romantic ballads that caresses the soul like
"Moon River" or "Days of Wine and Roses." When Harry Connick Jr. lets loose
with his dulcet tones, we do remember the good old movie days, when the
leading men wore tuxes and the women dyed their hair, and everyone in sight
smoked cigarettes. Now that was entertainment.;    "Sooner or Later" has much
the same feel but with a theatrical ambiance that oozes straight from the Mont
Blanc of composer Stephen Sondheim. The song is coy and close, and Madonna
slinks through it. It's like a gown falling off a torso.;    Her performance
and the song itself have a garish exhibitionism about them that fit perfectly
the movie from which they came. They mirror the colorful characters and the
colors of the costumes that were central to the allure and intrigue of "Dick
Tracy.";    Cute, tiny, sweet;  At one minute and four seconds, "Somewhere in
My Memory" is the shortest of the nominated songs. But then, its size is
roughly equivalent to that of the burglar-bashing terror of "Home Alone." The
only problem with it is that it is cute and tiny and sweet, while the
character in the movie was all that and more -- namely, rascally and nervy and
cheeky. But its composer, John Williams -- Master of the Obvious -- has an
aversion to subtlety. Not being able to express contradiction, he had to go
with one extreme or the other. And, as usual, he went with cute.;    The other
songs?;    They are songs, aren't they? They have notes and beats and theme
lines and all the other accouterments of musical products. But that's just it;
they are products.;    Another Streep nomination;  "I'm Checkin' Out" is bad
country sung badly by the lovely Meryl Streep. Lovely but untalented
musically. She probably thought she could enunciate her way through this
clunker and put it across. It doesn't work in any sense, either as acting or
singing. The only possible explanation for this thing being nominated is that
anything and everything Streep does gets an Oscar nomination.;    The rocking,
brawling "Blaze of Glory" is bad Bon Jovi, rehashed Bon Jovi (the group) by
its leader, Jon Bon Jovi. It is hard and heavy and made-for-MTV movie-music,
which was included in the score, no doubt, to offset production costs. Hey,
even if the movie flopped, the No. 1 hit song would compensate on the bottom
line. The only thing good about this song is Jeff Beck's ratchety, scratchety
picking.;    Couldn't there be an Oscar given for best guitarist in a
supporting role?;    Probably not.;    So we are stuck with the usual category
of "Music, Original Song.";    The envelope, if you please.;    And the winner
is: "Sooner or Later." (box)  </TEXT>
