There's not much to the Zube Tube, the Ultimate Cosmic Sound Machine. But then, 
there wasn't much to the Hula-Hoop, either. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-inch-long, brightly colored cardboard tube can produce sounds from "Star 
Wars" battles and MTV-style echoes to Gregorian chants, whale songs and the 
ocean's roar. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of noises you want to make are as infinite as your imagination," 
said Judy A. Walls, senior vice president of Ritam International Ltd., a toy 
company in the southeastern Iowa town of Fairfield. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no batteries, no electricity," she said. "I think everybody is just 
'electroniced' out." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the 2 3/4-inch-diameter tube is a spring that acts as an acoustic coil. 
The spring is connected at each end by custom-made plastic cups. A hole on the 
side of the tube allows a child's -- or adult's -- finger to reach in and pluck 
the spring, which produces the myriad of sounds. 
</P>
<P>
A person can also speak into the hole, as well as either end of the tube, to 
produce even more sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's going to be the next Hula-Hoop. In its first 18 months, they sold 
something like 100 million Hula-Hoops," Walls said. "We plan on doing the same 
thing. I think three years is realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 Zube Tubes have been sold since they were marketed in 
mid-September, she said. The suggested retail price is $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
Toy and gift companies in Finland, Switzerland, Germany, France, England and 
Canada have inquired about the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Watsey, Ritam executive vice president, said that while in London, a 
group of company officials went to Harrod's to tape a video using the 
department store's Zube Tube display. However, they ended up filming an empty 
display because the store was sold out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They say over there that the Zube Tube is more popular than Nintendo," Watsey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of the Zube Tube was developed by Bob Deissler, who was studying 
physics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing with a slinky and it happened to touch a Styrofoam cup," said 
Deissler, who was visiting the 10-year-old toy company this week. 
</P>
<P>
Intrigued by the sound, Deissler experimented with a different type of spring a 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked really great. That's when I really decided to pursue it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deissler applied for and received a patent in 1980.
