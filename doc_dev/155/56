AFTER THE courtyard of the Papal Palace, the next most prestigious venue for
a performance in Avignon during the Summer Festival, now in its 46th year,
is the Cloister of the Carmelites at the other end of the historic city.
It is currently being occupied by a company drawn from many French regional
theatres, the Compagnie des Ours, directed by Robert Cantarella. He has been
given the task of directing the Siege of Numantia by Cervantes, translated
from the Spanish into French verse by Jean-Jacques Preau and Philippe
Minyana. This is another new production in this year's festival tribute to
the Golden Age of Spain.
Because of Don Quixote, we tend to think of Cervantes as essentially a comic
writer and in the eyes of posterity that may be so, but the main theme
throughout all his work is herosim of a most stoical kind, reflecting his
own hard life. Endurance against overwhelming odds is the theme of this
sombre play. In it, he dramatised events in 135 BC, when Scipio, having
destroyed Carthage, turned his attention and his troops on to the Spanish
town of Numantia.
The Roman general's strategy was to dig a trench around the town, completely
cutting it off from food supplies so as to enforce its submission without
losing a single one of his men. The play tells the sad story of how that
plan was frustrated by the valour of the Numantians.
Apart from its relevance as a theatrical model of Resistance - there was a
notable production in Madrid, besieged by Franco's troops, in 1937 - it
presents a modern director with severe problems. It relies largely on
declamation rather than dialogue, and there is no single hero or heroine to
engage the attention. Instead we observe a continual progression of
characters, some of whom are abstractions - War, Spain, Famine - while
others are real people with a brief part to play in the growing famine that
afflicts them all.
Cantarella has taken a stunning gamble with the text. He treats it in a mood
of continual burlesque, playing against its rhetoric, letting the poignancy
of its meaning emerge through a series of turns derived from cabaret,
vaudeville, musical hall, and circus.
The women glide on in low-cut ball dresses, the men appear as acrobats in
clown costumes, and for much of the time they all perform slapstick-style,
ankle-deep in water as the main acting area in front of the cloisters has
been flooded. Jazz group Trois 8 provides musical accompaniment to these
antics and the company takes the plunge, often literally, with style.
Some of the fun and games are hilarious. Sacrifices to the gods are made by
conjurors, and a man brought back from the dead makes a macabre reappearance
upside down.
Everything hinges on whether at the end, when the last few surviving
Numantians make their act of defiance and capture a loaf of bread at the
cost of their lives, Cantarella can pull back from farce to tragedy. Thanks
to a small boy (Antoinin Broutard), the ultimate survivor who jumps from the
top of a tower - a toy one - rather than surrender, the director just about
makes his bid; but it is a damned close run thing.
THE Spanish fever that has gripped this year's Avignon Festival is not just
confined to reviving some of the dramatic works of the era of Philip II. The
Festival has opened its arms to modern Spain and Spanish culture throughout
Latin America, nowhere more so than in the area of dance.
Avignon has always been essentially a festival of drama, but at the same
time has presented programmes of classical ballet, oriental and modern
dance. This year - in a signed statement - the directorate has made a
commitment to give dance the same status from now on as that given to drama.
By August 3, when the festival ends, 10 different dance companies will have
been seen, ensuring at least one choreographic work each evening.
The first was Plein Soleil by Joelle Bouvier and Regis Obadia, a new work
heavily Spanish in tone performed by members of L'Esquisse, the dance
company, based in Normandy and founded in 1980 by these two gifted artists.
At the outset, the entire company of six men and six women is on stage,
utterly still and subdued, staring at the audience. The women in black
dresses sit on wooden chairs while the men in suits stand beside them. The
music by Louis Winsberg sounds a plaintive air on cello and piano. Soft
light filters through the colonnade. The atmosphere is as heavy with grief
as the aftermath of a funeral.
Slowly the mood changes. The beat becomes more emphatic as percussion takes
over from strings, soon to be augmented by flamenco hand-claps. The men turn
to caress their partners; then passionately embrace them; then lift them
high in the air.
Now the sun breaks through and the music incites the dancers to frenzy. The
pairs re-form into groups and there are a series of breathtaking lifts as
women appear to be hurtling through the air before they are caught in the
arms of the men. The erotic charge generated slowly but surely makes the
recent ballet at Covent Garden on a somewhat similar theme, The Judas Tree,
seem as if it had been scripted by Enid Blyton.
Outside the ballet, homage to the Hispanic has been equally widespread. The
85-year-old Nobel prize winner Octavio Paz is here, attending conferences
and giving interviews while his native Mexico has been recreated on stage at
the Luberon village of Les Taillades by the innovative French theatre
director Georges Lavaudant in a strange melange of acting, mime, music and
dance.
Terra Incognita is a mixed media show concocted by Lavaudant and based on
his own Mexican experience as a young man.
He arrives in this country of extremes to attend a conventional ambassador's
cocktail party. The disjointed chatter is soon interrupted by the appearance
of symbolic figures and archetypes from the country's heritage - the
ever-present grinning death's head, the proud conquistadors, the slinky
nightclub hostesses, and last the native Indians. A Mexican trio and a
singer perform from time to time punctuating the rather fragmented scenario.
The whole farrago is acted violently by a talented troupe from the Theatre
National Populaire.
It all seemed a curious throwback to the evasive happy-go-lucky mood of the
1960s.
