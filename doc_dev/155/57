   Romance and femininity were in the air and on the
runways as top designers unveiled their summer haute couture
offerings.
   Short skirts, curvy silhouettes, swooping decolletes and
charming colors were the most striking messages in the week of
shows. If the top designers have guessed right, women want to be
more feminine than ever as the new decade begins.
   There were also plenty of well-cut pants for daytime or evening
as an alternative to women who would rather hide than bare their
legs.
   It was a roller coaster week. The grandmasters like Yves Saint
Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel and new
master Christian Lacroix triumphed.
   Paco Rabanne, a 56-year-old Spanish-born designer, won the
Golden Thimble award. Having worked in Paris for nearly 40 years,
Rabanne finally overcame his ``metallic sculptor'' image to receive
the coveted prize awarded twice yearly by fashion writers.
   But things didn't go so well in houses with new couture creators
drawn from the ranks of ready-to-wear. The inventive Claude
Montana, who took over as Lanvin's haute couture designer, drew
sullen reviews.
   Although purely Montana, his clothes featuring mainly skinny
pants with various toppers looked too self-consciously
``futuristic'' for the moneyed set that's used to feminine clothes
from Lanvin.
   Another flop was Angelo Tarlazzi's second collection for Guy
Laroche. Although he had some zingy raffia-bordered south-of-the
border stuff plus cute stitched peasant dresses and gringo pants,
the show didn't quite make the couture grade.
   But there was much to remember elsewhere, and the beauty of
couture is that each client _ and those who are inspired by couture
looks _ can opt for skirt lengths longer than the sensational
runway models.
   Who's going to wear this, wonder bemused TV spectators treated
to snippets of the spectacular shows. The answer is hardly anybody.
   The outfits costing around $10,000 and bought by only a handful
of women are mainly money-losers for the big-name houses. But the
designers' renown serves to give the houses big publicity and
promote sales of the real moneymakers _ perfume and cosmetics,
ready-to-wear and accessories.
   Gossamer-light luxury fabrics made these clothes look lighter
than ever, though Yves Saint Laurent won kudos for his sleek white
suits in heavy pique, ridged tussore, and Shantung silk.
   Memorable styles included the Lolita charmers at Chanel, though
most real women couldn't wear the teeny hint-of-chiffon skirts in
delightful shades of coral and pink peeping under the sharply
fitted long jackets.
   Christian Lacroix had a field day with the light fabrics,
mounding clouds of organza, lace or faille on wrapped or puffed
skirts under skimpy or decollete tops for his incomparable
high-waisted, trapeze look of luxury.
   The shoulder issue is irrelevant, because Saint Laurent and
Givenchy's bold-shouldered daytime silhouettes still look elegant,
while at Lacroix, Chanel, Dior and elsewhere they are mainly hidden
under big organza collars or discreetly small and rounded by
minimal padding.
   As in ready-to-wear that's already appearing in the shops, the
bosom is a big couture winner. Many suits or draped dresses have
slashed decollete effects.
   And transparent blouses are around _ although far from
exclusively _ for those who want see-through chic.
   Evening wear inevitably bares shoulders, pushing up bosoms under
strapless bustiers or daring decolletes a la Belle Epoque or the
18th century look of Marie-Antoinette.
   Other outstanding couture offerings included Jean-Louis
Scherrer's repeat trip to the fabulous India of the Raj. His
jeweled, lace-embroidered light silk draped dresses or trouser
outfits in white or tender pastels were an exercise in opulent
beauty.
   Ungaro made a hit by trimming down his line to the couture
basics. His line of colorful short coat-dresses and suits combining
arabesques of several bright colors were a delight to the eye.
   Typical of the haute couture were sophisticated draped and
split-skirt models in sumptuous light fabrics at Balmain by
designer Erik Mortensen.
   Fabric trends for the new soft looks include gabardine,
cashmere, raw silk and textured linen, as well as shantung, silk
crepe and cotton pique for daytime to the cocktail hour.
   For evening, romance came out in silk faille, satin and clouds
of organza and chiffon. There's also lots of delicate or heavier
guipure lace, plus re-embroidery and appliqued motifs, pearls,
sequins and feathers.
   The color palette includes lots of white and ivory, regulation
spring navy and brighter peacock blues. Khaki, tobacco, desert
beige and chartreuse flash into sunbursts of yellows and mandarin
orange, with gleaming lashings of gold brocade and lame for evening.
   Pastels range from flesh tones to the most delicate eggshell
pinks and blues and absinthe green. Violet, salmon, flame and
fuchsia reds were outstanding in a brighter vein.
   To go with this couture splendor, there were all kinds of
eye-catching headgear, from satin turbans to enormous circular
haloes at Cardin, funny visored pillboxes and piecrust-crimped
crowns at Givenchy.
   Chanel showed new boaters with bows under the brims, and
Valentino topped many of his sophisticated models with hats that
had trellis-style woven brims matching latticework on some of the
dresses.
