   Shoppers began their holiday buying wave, flocking to stores
across the country to start retailers' biggest selling season of
the year by bargain-hunting, browsing or seeking Santa Claus.

and towns were jammed Friday with shoppers eager to locate video
games, electronic gear, costume jewelry, accessories, perfumes and
novelty gifts.
   Many merchants expanded their hours, anticipating a crush of
business on a day that traditionally is their busiest of the year.

   Animal rights activists held demonstrations around the nation to
protest fur sales on the opening day of the holiday shopping
season, hoping to shame shoppers into abandoning their quest for
fur-lined garments.
   Game show host Bob Barker led 2,500 activists down New York
City's Fifth Avenue Friday to tell shoppers the price is always
wrong when it comes to buying fur.
   Demonstrators also marched in Harrisburg, Pa.; Corpus Christi,
Texas; and Syracuse, N.Y., and protests were scheduled in dozens of
other cities around the nation.

   Eastern Airlines said there are no jobs for the
pilots and flight attendants who have ended their 8{-month-old
strikes, setting the stage for another legal battle for the
struggling carrier.
   With the holdout Machinists pledging Friday to continue their
strike, the main impact of the other unions' return to work
appeared to be more legal disputes between the company and unions.
   Meanwhile, a Machinists union leader said officials were working
out details of plans to step up their strike campaign to capitalize
on Eastern's precarious financial situation and what the union says
is a maintenance shortage.

harder'' for political reforms, as the first trial opened in a

   GM spokesman John Pekarek said the decision to sell the shares
came because the company wanted ``to take advantage of our initial
investment.''
