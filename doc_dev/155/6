More than 40,000 Slinky animal pull toys have been recalled because paint used 
on them may contain too much lead, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.

<P>
The agency also says 234,000 clown dolls are being recalled because they pose a 
choking hazard. The dolls, manufactured by Omaha-based Oriental Trading Co. and 
sold through mail order catalogues as the "Dress Up Clown" or "Funny Clown," 
were recalled because they have small parts that present a choking risk to 
young children.
