<LEADPARA>  THAT most "in" of fashion institutions, the fall couture shows featuring
made-to-order creations that can cost as much as $30,000 for an evening dress,
have ended in Paris.;    The couture is not the same as ready-to-wear, the
designer clothes bought "off the rack" in stores. Its clientele, surprisingly,
is about 70 percent American, and includes such fashion stars as Nan Kempner,
Lynn Wyatt and Betsy Bloomingdale.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Still, the couture is not a money maker. Even in good times -- before the
gulf war (Middle Eastern customers are also good customers) -- it was
estimated to lose $1 million a year. On average, even "big" houses such as
Yves St. Laurent or Dior sell fewer than 1,500 couture items a year.;   
However, the couture more than makes up for its losses with spinoff ventures
such as ready-to-wear, fragrances and licensees, and it has influence
completely out of proportion to its small size. It is, you might say, a test
run for what will later appear on the ready-to-wear runways of the world. Or
even on the first floor of your favorite mall.;    Judging from the recent
parade of fall fashions, these are the couture trends to watch:;    (check)
The golden rule: Gold lace-trimmed cocktail and evening things at Christian
Lacroix, and gold embroidered silk tulle makes a short evening dress at
Jean-Louis Scherrer.;    (check) Beads &amp; sequins: Like Gianfranco Ferre's
coat, Lacroix's sequin jacket and Versace's long-sleeved cocktail dress
trimmed with beaded checkerboard cuffs.;    (check) Teeny hemlines: Not much
longer than a swimsuit, and appearing at a bare minimum at Claude Montana for
Lanvin, and Versace -- longer (an inch or two above the knee) at Louis Feraud,
Nina Ricci and Balmain.;    (check) Longer hemlines: Three and 4 inches above
the ankle are still straws in the wind at Ungaro, Pierre Cardin and St.
Laurent.;    (check) Ultima tulle: Karl Lagerfeld has discovered new uses for
black net at Chanel, where he constructs layers of it into fitted little
fencing jackets and bouncy ballet skirts for evenings.;    (check) The barmaid
look: Chanel's bustiers for evening.;    (check) Patent pending: Lagerfeld
sometimes substituted black patent for Chanel's signature chains and braid
bindings.  </TEXT>
