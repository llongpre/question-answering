  [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- TRUD on the Russian-Uzbek 
summit: 
  "It was the first time that Moscow welcomed the leader of a 
sovereign republic with a guard of honour and motorcycle 
outriders, the honour which was previously bestowed only on the 
leaders of foreign countries. 
  "However, this does not signify an estrangement but is 
indicative, rather, of the ongoing drawing of the two countries 
closer together at a fundamentally new level and of the 
restoration and strengthening of the age-old ties between Russia 
and Uzbekistan." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the Russian-Uzbek accords: 
  "The accords reached in Moscow open up new opportunities for 
strengthening the political and economic relations between 
Russia and Uzbekistan. At the same time they encourage 
cooperation within the commonwealth of independent states". 
  PRAVDA on the Uzbek president's visit: 
  "The first official visit by Uzbekistan's head of state went 
off successfully. The results of the accords reached by the two 
presidents will undoubtedly make themselves felt already in the 
coming days". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an interview with 
Lieutenant- General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th 
Russian Army in the Dniester region. 
  In response to a question about the future of the 14th Army, 
General Lebed said: "As is known, the leadership of the Republic 
of Moldova advocates the withdrawal of the army from its 
territory, but, to my mind, it is now impossible to withdraw the 
army for a variety of reasons, beginning with the fact that the 
sanguinary conflict between Moldova and the Dniester region has 
not been resolved politically and, accordingly, there are no 
guarantees of peace and stability in the region. 
  "The possibility of a new flare-up of hostilities has not 
disappeared. People view the 14th Army as the guarantor of 
peace and stability, the guarantor which can prevent war and, if 
it is unleashed, stop the bloodshed. Therefore, the army's 
withdrawal should be preceded by a rather long, delicate and 
wise political process which, unfortunately, has not yet begun". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Bosnian peace process: 
  "The process of settling the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
on the principle of a threat of the use of force has reached a 
deadlock and leads to nowhere: NATO countries just cannot for 
years threaten with air strikes. Neither can the peoples of 
Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia to live for years under such a 
threat... 
  "It is important these days, as never before, to prevent the 
conflict in Bosnia from growing into a European tragedy and 
deprive NATO of the right to determine when bombing and missile 
strikes in Bosnia should be carried out. 
  "It is essential urgently to look for new approaches to and 
ideas of a political settlement both in Bosnia and within a 
broader context in the Balkans. Such a decision should be taken 
at the level of, at least, the U.N. Security Council". 
  TRUD runs an interview with Professor Aleksandr Livshits, 
dr. 
of science (economics) and leader of the expert group to the 
Russian president. 
  Livshits, one of the main economic advisers to President 
Boris Yeltsin, said in particular that he sees it as the main 
task now "to make market reforms less burdensome for society 
without slowing down the reform process. The main thing is to 
ensure that the price of market reforms is not too great for 
society". 
  PRAVDA frontpages the text of Aleksandr Rutskoy's address to 
the people of Russia and to the members of the State Duma under 
the headline "There Can Be No Creative Endeavour Without Civil 
Peace". 
  The message says in particular that "in autumn last year all 
those, who were in the parliament building and manned the 
barricades, discharged their civil and patriotic duty to the 
end, upholding nascent parliamentarism, democracy and the 
constitution... For my part, I will do everything depending on 
me to perpetuate the lucid memory of those who perished..." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the amnesty decision: 
  "The political amnesty story has once again pointed out the 
major flaw in our present-day democracy -- the inadequecy of the 
judicial branch of power. Will the judicial branch draw level 
with the other branches of power? Stability and accord in 
society depend on that in many respect". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages an interview with Mikhail 
Slinko, investigator of particularly important cases at the 
Moscow city prosecutor's office and the leader of a team of 
investigators probing charges of corruption brought up against 
Aleksandr Rutskoy in August last year. 
  Slinko said Rutskoy's signature on the documents, which were 
submitted to the investigators and which testified against the 
former vice-president, was forged. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA comments on a joint statement issued by 
Patriarch Aleksey II of Moscow and all Russia and Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. In the statement the church and 
the army expressed readiness to cooperate for the benefit of the 
motherland. 
  The St. Petersburg-based newspaper VESTI reports that a 
monument to Finnish prisoners of war has been unveiled at 
Gatchina. According to data provided by Russian and Finnish 
historians, about 1,000 Finns died at Soviet P.O.W. camps during 
the Second World War. 
  The monument represents a shell-splinter piercing red 
granite 
symbolising the soldier's heart.
