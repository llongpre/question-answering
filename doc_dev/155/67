Doctors are not the only ones issuing prescriptions for cancer patients at 
Presbyterian Hospital. The patients themselves can order up a dose of 
Dangerfield, or a Marx Brothers booster, from the Laugh Mobile.

"It's a real pick-me-up," said Wanda Mooers, who has been battling cancer of 
the lymph nodes for more than 14 months. "You can pick out things -- even 
Play-Doh and crayons -- to take your mind off your problems."

Every Monday and Friday, volunteers wheel the 5-foot-tall yellow cart around 
Presbyterian's seventh-floor cancer unit. It holds about 35 videotapes, ranging 
from "National Lampoon's Animal House" to "The Three Stooges" to TV sitcoms and 
performances by comedians such as Rodney Dangerfield, as well as humorous books 
and audiotapes and games -- even Slinky toys.

"I look forward to it," said Mooers, the mother of two young sons. "When you're 
going through chemotherapy and radiation, you need to put yourself in a good 
state of mind, which is sometimes difficult to do."

"It gives them some diversion while they're in the hospital," said Sherry 
Bargoil, cancer control program coordinator. "Medically speaking, we know there 
is some mind-body connection." 
</P>

In his book, "Anatomy of An Illness," Norman Cousins wrote: "Even if we find 
that laughter produces no specific biochemical changes, it does accomplish one 
very essential purpose: It tends to help a person cope with apprehension and 
even panic that all too frequently accompany serious illness." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials got the idea after talking with patients, Bargoil said. 
"Some of our younger leukemia patients who were staying with us for long 
periods began bringing in their own VCRs and renting tapes. We began to think, 
'Why can't we do something like this?' "
