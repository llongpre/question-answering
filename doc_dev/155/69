   Top designers Emanuel Ungaro, Karl Lagerfeld at
Chanel and Louis Feraud looked back Tuesday to the Gay Nineties for
inspiration in their couture shows for winter 1990.
   Otherwise they didn't have much in common except nostalgia.
   Ungaro centered his ideas somewhere between tartan taste and the
tarty opulence of a cocotte.
   The master draper indulged his penchant for piling on every rich
fabric in the sewing basket. His tightly draped silk blouses,
dresses and suits with fitted tartan jackets over flowered or
checked tiny skirts had a certain ingenue appeal.
   Easier to wear were the pearly gray daytime pants suits in glen
plaids or checks, the jackets dressed up with puffy sleeves.
Ungaro's signature leg o' mutton rhinestone-buttoned sleeves
cropped up repeatedly.
   For his hot, fitted numbers with draped skirts hitched to reveal
lots of leg he picked pink and blue duchess satins so electrically
hot they hurt the eyes. A lot of cocktail dresses came in
variations on the lame-brocade themes so dear to all designers for
next fall.
   Ungaro mixed this female-siren scene up with velvet bows, satin
frills, taffeta flounces wound around the body like a serpent, plus
acres of guipure, lace and re-embroidered velvet and silk.
   It ended with the models turning like Dresden china dolls on a
music box offering a bonanza of flowered satins and silks in
dresses with shepherdess sleeves, crinolines, bows and flowers, not
to mention marvelous beading, sequin embroidery, acres of ruffles
and lace for good measure.
   Things were somewhat more refined though no less sexy at Chanel,
where Karl Lagerfeld showed to an audience sweltering in marble
halls without air conditioning in the Palais de Chaillot.
   Paloma Picasso, Princess Caroline of Monaco and Bernadette
Chirac, wife of the mayor of Paris, appaluded Lagerfeld's fitted
lines echoing Edwardian or Victorian times.
   The topper defining the line from day to evening was a
wasp-waisted long riding jacket or redingote, unveiled first in
flame red decorated with black panels, piping and grid effects over
a narrow, short skirt. Gloves throughout were a great little touch,
especially with big furry cuffs.
   The Chanel look got a nice update with bold stitching instead of
piping and lots of diagonal pockets for a swinging look.
   Missing from the show was Chanel's top model, Ines de la
Fressange. A Chanel statement said she is ill, though it's rumored
she quarreled with Lagerfeld.
   There were lovely surprises like the turquoise redingote over a
blue-green chiffon skirt.
   And Lagerfeld often left out the skirt altogether, making the
jacket into a mini-dress, as in his ready-to-wear.
   The redingote sometimes was teamed with dressy cocktail numbers
with strapless or spaghetti-strapped bodices. And Lagerfeld, like
Ungaro, occasionally surprised with an electric-pink jacket, paired
with a sarong-wrapped skirt.
   There was more of Lagerfeld to this collection than Chanel,
though pearls, floppy neck bows and chain belts did appear. The
Chanel camellia was all over the place, but most flirtatious in a
tulip-scalloped skirt that looked too short to sit in.
   There was retrospective romance in gold guipure-incrusted
jackets with satin skirts, in fitted velvet bodices over full
lacquered tulle or lame-flowered skirts, in romantic lace dresses
in shades of orange, toast and pearl gray.
   The most wonderful evening gown was a body-hugging pearl pink
satin mermaid sheath worn with a fitted redingote topper, of course.
   Louis Feraud seemed to look back to circa 1930, with brightly
embroidered cloche hats, pleated skirts swinging four inches above
the ankle, boleros and an occasional peplum jacket.
   His big trapeze coats with cutout appliques looked mountainous.
   But his patchwork outfits in jewel colors glowed with good fun.
   And the multicolored flowered cloque laquered silk coat-dress
topped with black fox definitely had the stamp of Feraud the artist.
   The romantic Edwardians here were swathed in acres of fluted and
pleated organza ruffs.
   And Feraud turned out some breathtaking jeweled and beaded
sheaths paved in gold, bronze and copper topped by pearls and amber
and topaz stones.
   After all the nostalgia, romance and opulence everywhere else,
the Guy Laroche collection by Angelo Tarlazzi looked so understated
the creator didn't seem to imbue it with the clout of true couture.
   One would like to praise Tarlazzi _ chosen by Laroche himself to
succeed him when he died. But the capable designer with his own
Paris ready-to-wear firm stayed so far on the cautious side it
looked more like a dirge than a celebratory collection in memory of
Laroche.
   The most striking of his ``plain'' clothes were backless black
cocktail dresses in emulation of Laroche, who created a sensation
with one he designed for film star Mireille Darc a quarter century
ago.
