   The fall fashion message from London is short,
sporty by day and slinky by night, with flashes of British wit and
individuality.
   The mood among designers, however, is uncertain.
   Top designers Katherine Hamnett and John Galliano skipped London
to show in Paris. Two other big names, Rifat Ozbek and Jaspar
Conran, opted for videos instead of catwalk shows, and fewer buyers
stopped off in London en route from Milan to Paris.
   Nonetheless, there was still some of that old wacky madness that
put London on the fashion map.
   Vivienne Westwood, the mother of punk garb, captivated the
audience with a collection ranging from classic tailored tartan
suits to fake fur-trimmed bloomers worn with Old Master-print
corsets.
   A Lycra-clad dancing troupe dressed as haute couture pigs opened
the show based on barnyard characters of country life. Bodymap did
a vision of drag-queen club life in their sexy sportswear
collection.
   Britain's designers of the year, Workers For Freedom duo Richard
Nott and Graham Fraser, showed a collection Nott described as
``spare feminity,'' which featured bikinis over striped body suits,
one of the key fall looks from London.
   London Fashion Week, which ends Tuesday, has spread out even
further with designers showing all over town and the trade show
featuring about 250 exhibitors at the Olympia 2 exhibition hall.
   At Olympia, accessories from hats to bracelets seemed hotter
than clothes.
   ``I think largely because of high interest rates and the high
cost of living, women can't afford to buy another outfit, so
they're buying accessories,'' said Beverley Mann, 28, one of the
design duo of the costume jewelry firm Flash Harry.
   Melanie Lazlo of Obsession, another costume jewelry firm, said:
``London is kind of a melting pot for a wide range of accessories
ranging from the weird and wonderful to the Channel-type classic.''
   Many fashion designers said the number of buyers was down.
   ``It's much quieter than it was last year,'' said David Sassoon
of Belville Sassoon-Lorcan Mullany, one of London's top eveningwear
designers.
   ``I think stores everywhere are having a hard time,'' he said.
``Where money's tight, they want selling clothes. They don't want
jokes. ... They don't want over the top things they might have
indulged in previously.''
   Benny Ong, another leading designer whose soft, sensual clothes
sell internationally, agreed that the economic situation was
keeping buyers away from London.
   ``That's why it's important at those times when the economic
situation is not so hot to go for color _ to pick yourself up,'' he
said. ``Power-dressing has also changed to something more feminine
and confident.''
   Edina Ronay, bucking the trend with her first catwalk show, said
her business was up and insisted London was ``not going to fall
flat on its face because two people show in Paris,''
   Her collection of suits and parkas in orange, ochre and olive,
fur-trimmed and brocade hooded jackets and skin-tight gold lame and
black tops and body suits won high marks for wearability.
   There were plenty other wearable clothes as well.
   Bruce Oldfield, who designs many of Princess Diana's dresses,
incorporated the sporty spirit in his hooded, printed parkas,
luxurious velvet bodysuits, sequined sweatshirts and a
gold-sequined bomber jacket with pants.
   Caroline Charles did a ``Eurochic'' collection featuring
Romanian peasant embroideries and folksy tapestry and fringing
alongside her snappy city suits and slinky evening dresses.
   Ozbek abandoned his summer white for dazzling colors _ another
fall theme _ in hooded tops, tunics, cropped bomber jackets and
leggings and body suits in dazzling sequins, stretch velvet and
gold lame.
   Conran found his inspiration in ``the off-duty ballerina,'' with
body-hugging catsuits topped by cropped leather jackets and quilted
bronze bomber jackets.
   Helen Story, one of the up-and-coming young designers, had fun
with a soccer-for-women look, again featuring hooded bomber jackets
and soccer shorts with her signature fringing.
