   Christian Lacroix drifted into spring and summer on
a soft pastel cloud, sometimes bursting open with color, at Sunday's
opening of French haute couture collections.
   Femininity, and the unexepected, already prevail in Paris, where
Italy's favorite fashion son, Valentino, will ensure the surprise
ending this year. Abandoning Rome, at least this season, he will cap
the week of French collections on Thursday with his first haute
couture showing in Paris.
   The move, which has unsettled Roman fashion lords, serves to
confirm the pre-eminence of French haute couture, which can set
trends for the entire fashion industry.
   Romance, sometimes smoldering, is clearly the word for summer
from Paris, and chiffon or crepe is the language of love, even in
pants. Sexy sheaths make sure the romance is enticing.
   Hem lengths traveled from the floor to above the knee with no
minis yet in sight. Exaggerated shoulders also disappeared.
   Gold was the prevailing accent, from buttons to loafers at
Lacroix, along with ruffles and wide-brimmed hats.
   Torrente, opening the season, used chiffon dramatically, in
capes, trains or simply as long scarves carressing the neck.
   Sailor themes cropped up as a counterpoint to softness, with
clean marine lines in navy or black and white.
   Leaving Provencal behind for exotic Saharan climes, Lacroix
draped reams of chiffon in flowing pants-skirts reminiscent of a
gust of sand, embroidered and bejeweled raw silk, used lace almost
relentlessly and gathered organza into sumptuous mountains.
   His palette was above all the beige-tones and exotic pastels like
melon and pistachio, mixed with bright poppy, Persian blue and
black, white and navy.
   Lacroix made good his gift for surprise, mixing rustic and fine
fabrics in his 57 outfits, introducing the fringe and occasionally
poking a hole in his pastel clouds with rhythmic lines and splashes
of loud color.
   Minimizing the waist, the ``trapezium'' and ''pyramid'' shapes
prevailed for day wear at Lacroix.
   It was pure charm in a powder pink shantung tunic which flared
over cocoa-colored, silk linen ``pencil'' pants.
   A pyramid coat-dress in verbena linen, flared above the waist, or
a Persian blue silk trapezium raincoat also had that demure charm.
   Body-skimming softness or smoldering black lace, organza and
raffia took over for after-hours when feminine turns female.
   Lacroix revealed his knack for the spectacular with a few
fringes. For daywear, he dressed up a khaki linen outfit with black
embroidery on top and black fringes dancing on the skirt. A dramatic
after-dark version featured gold and thread woven pajamas with a
beaded floor-length fringe.
   Pants-skirts or strapless jumpsuits, as elegant as gowns, were
often topped with intricate embroidery or lace and warn under
sumptuous jackets.
   Typifying the mood of wistful romance was his number aptly
entitled ``Je t'aime'' (I love you), a drifty vanilla-colored poncho
of organza decorated with hand-painted flowers and collared with
lace, warn over a sandy-colored chiffon pants-skirt.
   His ``piece de resistance'' was the strapless pique floor-length
dress, tenderly flowered and topped with a shawl-like blue ziberline
jacket with fringe.
   Torrente maintained Parisian chic by day with polka dot pastel
dresses, kick pleats sometimes topped with a bow, or tiered dresses
and, always, wide-brimmed hats.
   Elegance by night was, most notably, in black and white.
   Draped chiffon and crepe, held at the shoulder or waist with
jewels or a bow, were lovely. Smoky chiffon scarves were beautifully
used in dramatic trains, sometimes running from the shoulder.
   There was drama in an almost classic solid black gown, with
lapels at the bodice and a whimsical white and black polka dot
kerchief.
   Hanae Mori ended the day's shows with more accolades to
femininity.
   Her floor-length yellow draped sheath with a line of ruffles
running from the shoulders to the toes is a toast to the female
form. The corsage ruffle at the bust is another note to the refined
sophistication that marked her show.
