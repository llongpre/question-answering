The Scene: Thursday night's party for Robbie Conal, the "guerrilla artist" 
whose portraits of the famous and infamous regularly adorn every vertical 
surface in L. A. His paintings with sly captions ("Contra Diction" with Oliver 
North, "False Profit" with Jim and Tammy Bakker) had moved from the streets 
into Conal's first gallery show at the Pasadena Center for the Arts, and the 
event, at the West Hollywood club Po Na Na Souk, was both a closing night for 
the show and a benefit for the nonprofit monthly magazine the New Art Examiner. 
Santa Monica gallery owner Robert Berman emceed the evening, which featured a 
raffle of some Conal art works and dancing to Brazilian pop music.

The Buzz: Everyone seemed to have an opinion on the reelection of North 
Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, who has taken on the stature of Public Enemy No. 1 
in the art world. Conal's portrait of the senator features his visage on an 
artist's pallet, with the hole position in the senator's forehead and captions 
like "Artificial Art Official." "I put it up (on posters) all over Washington, 
D. C., but I don't know if he's seen it," said Conal. "But my work is for 
regular people, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Lots of ponytails on the men and slinky black dresses on the women. 
Overalls are making a comeback -- worn by night crawlers who are just coming 
home at the hour when real farmers are getting up to feed the chickens. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion Statements: Conal wore a bowling shirt with "Art" stitched over the 
pocket, while Joan Hugo, the new L. A. editor of the New Art Examiner, wore a 
brooch made of light-emitting diodes. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Mussels, quiche, duck sausage, and rumaki, served up by waiters wearing 
harem pants, big shaggy hair and a lot of attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: The event was open to the public -- at least those members of 
the public with $30 to spare. Ten dollars bought a chance to win a framed and 
signed Conal poster. And $4 got a beer -- a relative bargain on the private 
club scene, where a glass of club soda can go for $6. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Conal's image of Jesse Helms was erected on a billboard at the corner 
of Santa Monica and La Cienega in West Hollywood, only to be taken down by the 
billboard company after a few days. After considerable protest from Conal and 
friends in the art community, it was put back up. "The experience with that 
billboard taught me never to do anything legal ever again," said Conal.
