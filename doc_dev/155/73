   There's good news for women rich enough to afford
the haute couture clothes shown by 20 high fashion designers in
Paris this week. After a few seasons of extravagance, the look is
pretty and wearable.
   The mood was strictly feminine in showings dominated by tender,
wispy chiffons and silks, bias cuts, body-hugging sheaths and
bustiers, oversized pants and plenty of pleats. Evening wear was
regal with generous use of embroidery, lace and jewels, and gold and
silver applique.
   It was adieu to oversized shoulders, mini-skirts and party poufs.
The lines are fluid and graceful, with fluttering chiffons and soft
crepes seen for both daytime and evening wear.
   Hems, for the most part, skimmed the knee, although Chanel opted
for the midcalf length worn under long tunic jackets reminiscent of
the 1930s.
   Dresses cost anywhere from $10,000 and up, and set trends for the
fashion industry worldwide.
   For some designers, like Givenchy, it was the year of the dress.
But pants lovers will find some in almost every collection. Yves
Saint-Laurent's showed plenty of his signature trousers cut to
perfection, stopping above the ankle, and Per Spook excelled at
easy-to-wear pajamas pants that covered the shoe.
   For the cocktail hour, look for Guy Laroche's simple black sheath
that plunges to the waist in the back and circled by gentle
white-tipped ruffling.
   Laroche was this year's winner of the Golden Thimble award for
the most beautiful collection, and he earned it with classy designs
in colors that exploded on the runway: sunbursts of yellow, juicy
reds and bright oranges melting into gentle pastels in the palest of
blue, green and pink.
   Saint-Laurent, too, did wonders with the basics, slitting skirts
from hem to waist and revealing lots of leg. Suit jackets necklines
dipped dramatically and his ultra-sheer chiffon blouses worn with
skirts bared all.
   Italian fashion king Valentino made his debut in the world of
French haute couture, ruffling feathers in Rome. Things only got
worse when his business partner, Giancarlo Giametti, defended the
decision saying Valentino couldn't afford to show for ``down-and-out
women and second-rate actresses.''
   Valentino showed the same clothes as he did in Rome, and they
were a hit with the French couture crowd. Christian Lacroix
abandoned the extravagance of his previous collections and came up
with feminine design in clouds of pastel. He draped reams of chiffon
in flowing pant-skirts, embroidered and bejeweled raw silk. He used
lace relentlessly and gathered organza into sumptuous mountains.
   Lacroix's palette was full of sandy beiges recalling desert
exoticism _ a replacement of his previous Provencal look _ mixing
melon and pistachio pastels, poppy reds, Persian blue, black, white
and navy.
   Unlike Givenchy, Laroche and Saint-Laurent who played up the
waist with drapery, belts and buttons galore, Lacroix minimized it
with trapezium and triangular shapes.
   Torrente maintained Parisian chic by day with polka dot pastel
dresses, kick pleats sometimes topped with a bow or tiered dresses,
and always, wide-brimmed hats. For after-dark, there were draped
chiffon and crepe, held at the shoulder or waist with jewels or a
bow.
   Hanae Mori was another toast to femininity. Her floor-length
yellow draped sheath was set off by a line of ruffles running from
shoulder to toe.
   For evening wear, Christian Dior went to the sari, using feathery
light fabrics like crepe georgette or shantung silk crepe in a
diagonal movement from waist to the opposite shoulder, and Indian
style, around the back to the hand.
   Pierre Cardin made the mini even smaller than before, then
covered it up, almost.
   Nini Ricci, not known as a trend-setter, produced a large
collection of simple but beautiful clothes for all times of day.
   There were wide, soft pants, pleated and swirling skirts and
cinched waists creating a kind of nostalgic girlish prettiness.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer revelled in pants, dressing them down for day
or up for night with lace and embroidery.
   For lovers of long skirts, there's perfection in Chanel's pretty
schoolgirl look, particulary good for daytime in navy and cream. The
new Chanel jacket is longer and collarless, fastening with a single
button just above the waist.
   Watch for the newest Chanel buttons in pearl, and the silky
smooth leather purse _ the latest in Chanel chic.
