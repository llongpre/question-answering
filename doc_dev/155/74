Since fashion has become deregulated and anything goes, it has become harder 
and harder to dress for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Say a guy is standing at the door with long hair, a bandanna on his head and a 
ring in his ear. Is he a pirate? In your dreams. He's your daughter's date, 
better known as a Maalox Moment. 
</P>
<P>
Slinking in the darkness is a kid wearing baggy pants, a nylon stocking over 
his face and a sweat shirt. Is he a bum looking for a treat? No, he just ripped 
off someone's tape deck. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street is a girl with a pillowcase, dressed in stone-washed jeans, 
cowboy boots and a 10-gallon hat. Is she dressed as a cowgirl begging for a 
treat? Get real. She's Maxine and Ed's daughter bringing her laundry home from 
college. 
</P>
<P>
What constitutes a "costume" has changed with the years, but the one thing that 
never changes is that most people wait until the 11th hour to come up with one. 
Since our grown kids perceive our closets to house the greatest collection of 
period costumes (vintage 1970) outside the Smithsonian, the decision of what to 
wear to a Halloween party starts here. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, where's that corny little dress with the drop waist? I could put a ribbon 
in my hair and go as Alice in Wonderland." (I'm wearing it.) 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, do you still have that apron you used to wear when we were kids? I could 
dress as a maid." 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, loan me a white wig and pearls to look like Barbara Bush." 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute. Two pillows under your favorite T-shirt and I could be a 
pregnant Fergie." 
</P>
<P>
"Where are Dad's wild golf pants? It's a great mid-life crisis disguise." 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years my son has gone to a party as Gandhi. It's an easy 
decision. Only at our house could he open Pandora's box and find such instant 
treasures as a clean sheet, dark make-up and granny glasses. However, I think 
last October was his last fling. Someone approached him at a party and thought 
he was Charlton Heston. 
</P>

The difference between adults and children at Halloween is that most adults 
wouldn't dream of wearing a store-bought costume. It's like admitting you don't 
have the imagination of a food processor. And maybe therein lies the challenge. 
Are you dressed as Madonna or did you just come from work? 
</P>

A few years ago, my husband and I answered the doorbell and a small ghost and a 
witch pointed their fingers at us and said, "We got it. He's a football coach 
and you're a plumber." My husband was wearing his sweats and I was lounging 
around in a jumpsuit. We gave them each an apple. They reached in their bags 
and gave us two popcorn balls.
