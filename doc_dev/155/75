   After a few seasons of flamboyance, French high
fashion designers are back to basics with softly stated summer and
spring clothes.
   The mood was breezy and feminine in the lines of 20 designers who
unveiled thousands of original outfits in winter previews for
audiences that included movie stars and VIPs.
   The dresses, each costing $10,000 or more, are custom-made for a
mere 3,000 women. Yet they set trends for much of the fashion
industry worldwide.
   There were airy chiffons and silks in a myriad of pastels and
gentle prints, bias cuts, body-hugging sheaths and bustiers,
oversized pants and pleats. Evening wear looked regal with generous
use of embroidery, lace, jewels, and gold and silver applique.
   Italian couture king Valentino made his Paris debut, ruffling
feathers in Rome and dazzling the French couture crowd with a
stunning look that was sweet and sexy, even in prim navy and white.
   Indian themes were dominant. Valentino decorated his evening
jackets with gold and silver elephants, and Per Spook and Christian
Lacroix served up palettes of subtle beiges and creams. Marc Bohan's
new designs included a sari effect done with feathery light silk
draped around the bodice and over the shoulder.
   Yves Saint-Laurent's collection featured slits cut high above the
thigh, deep-cut necklines, and his signature feminized tailoring.
   Except for Saint-Laurent, it was adieu to oversized shoulders,
miniskirts and pouffy ball gowns. The lines were fluid and graceful,
with wispy chiffons and soft crepes for both daytime and after dark.
   Hems, for the most part, skimmed the knee, though many designers
showed the leg with asymmetrical wraparounds and skirts, long and
short, slit from hem to waist.
   Chanel, however, opted for calf-length pleated skirts for daytime
wear, especially good in navy and cream. Worn under long tunic
jackets and with two-tone flats, they had a schoolgirl charm
reminiscent of the 1930s.
   The latest evolution of the classic Chanel jacket showed a longer
cut, fastening with a single button just above the waist; the newest
Chanel buttons were pearl. A major switch was a smooth leather
purse, superseding the chain-handled quilted bag as a Chanel status
symbol.
   For most designers, it was the year of the dress. Givenchy took
the simple shirtwaist classic and dressed it up or down, depending
on the time of day. Pleated or belted, cinched or cravated, dresses
were aimed to appeal to those with conservative tastes who still
like a touch of glamor.
   Pant lovers, thin and not-so-thin, will be comfortable in Spook's
pajama pants worn under layers of vests for day or under colorful
embroidered tunics for after dark.
   Saint-Laurent showed an array of menswear-styled trousers for day
and evening wear. Cut to just above the ankle, they created a long,
slimming line flowing down through high heeled pumps. They were
shown with suit jackets that dipped dramatically or with with
ultra-sheer chiffon blouses.
   Guy Laroche was this year's winner of the Golden Thimble award
for the most beautiful collection with his classy designs in
brilliant colors: sunbursts of yellow, juicy reds and bright oranges
melting into the palest of springy pastels.
   One of his designs was an elegantly simple black sheath that was
high-necked in the front but backless to the waist and circled by
white-edged ruffling.
   Lacroix abandoned the extravagance of his previous collections
and came up with feminine pastels, draping chiffon in flowing
pantskirts and embroidered and bejeweled raw silk. He used lace and
gathered organza for a dreamy, cloudlike effect.
   Lacroix's palette was strong with sandy beiges evoking the
desert, mixing melon and pistachio pastels, poppy reds and Persian
blue, black, white and navy.
   In most of the collections, curves and busts were emphasized with
drapery, belts and buttons. The exception was Lacroix, who covered
them with trapeze and triangular shapes.
   Torrente maintained Parisian chic with daytime dresses of polka
dot pastels with kick pleats topped with bows, striking tiered
dresses, and wide-brimmed hats. For after dark, there were draped
chiffons and crepes, held at the shoulder or waist with jewels or
bows.
   Hanae Mori also toasted femininity with her floor-length yellow
draped sheath, set off by a line of ruffles running from shoulder to
toe.
   Nina Ricci produced a large collection of simple but beautiful
clothes in rich fabrics for all times of day. There were wide soft
pants, pleated and swirling skirts and cinched waists, creating a
nostalgic prettiness.
   For after hours, Ricci served up an understated but elegant long
sleeveless evening gown in peach crepe satin with pleated bodice and
back.
