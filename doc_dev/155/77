   Doctors aren't the only ones issuing
prescriptions for cancer patients at Presbyterian Hospital. The
patients themselves can order up a dose of Dangerfield, or a Marx
Brothers booster, from the Laugh Mobile.
   ``It's a real pick-me-up,'' said Wanda Mooers, who's been
battling cancer of the lymph nodes for more than 14 months. ``You
can pick out things _ even Play-Doh and crayons _ to take your mind
off your problems.''
   Every Monday and Friday, volunteers wheel the 5-foot-tall,
yellow cart around Presbyterian's seventh-floor cancer unit. It
holds about 35 videotapes, ranging from ``National Lampoon's Animal
House'' to ``The Three Stooges'' to TV sitcoms and comedians like
Rodney Dangerfield, as well as humorous books and audio tape and
games _ even Slinky toys.
   ``I look forward to it,'' said Mooers, the mother of two young
sons. ``When you're going through chemotherapy and radiation, you
need to put yourself in a good state of mind, which is sometimes
difficult to do.''
   ``It gives them some diversion while they're in the hospital,''
said Sherry Bargoil, cancer control program coordinator.
``Medically speaking, we know there is some mind-body connection.''
   In his book, ``Anatomy of An Illness,'' Norman Cousins wrote:
``Even if we find that laughter produces no specific biochemical
changes, it does accomplish one very essential purpose, it tends to
help a person cope with apprehension and even panic that all too
frequently accompany serious illness.''
   Hospital officials got the idea after talking with patients, Ms.
Bargoil said. ``Some of our younger leukemia patients who were
staying with us for long periods began bringing in their own VCRs
and renting tapes. We began to think, `Why can't we do something
like this?'''
   They consulted Ruth Hamilton, executive director of the Carolina
Health and Humor Association, who started the first Laugh Mobile at
Duke University three years ago, and the hospital auxiliary
provided $5,000 to pay for it.
   In January, a second Laugh Mobile will begin making the rounds
at the children's cancer unit at Prebyerian, and officials are
toying with the idea of working out a deal with a national video
chain to offer new movies.
   Mooers said the program means a lot to her, especially when
she's feeling lonely and depressed. ``I honestly feel more people
should pay attention to the people in the cancer ward. They should
stop by and see how they're doing.''
