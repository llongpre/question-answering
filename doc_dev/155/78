<LEADPARA>  DIMENSIONS Dance Theater celebrated the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.
with a program Sunday of exciting African dance and two guests who ran away
with the show.;    Program and setting confirmed the theme, "Tribute to a
Dream." The master of ceremonies was Clifford Brown Jr. of KBLX radio, who
spoke briefly and gracefully about King's living legacy. The performance took
place in the Calvin Simmons Theater, named for the late conductor of the
erstwhile Oakland Symphony who was the first black director of a major
American orchestra. (Simmons died in a boating mishap in 1982 at the age of
32.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The past and the future;  And the program, after going back to Africa in
its dances, looked to the future by featuring Stanley Jordan, a phenomenal
jazz guitarist who has been nominated for a 1991 Grammy Award.;    King's
words came alive in the voice of Al Eaton, who performed an excerpt from his
one-man show, "M.L.K./We Are the Dream." The "I Have a Dream" speech, spoken
on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington,
sounded to me exactly as King spoke it, cadenced and exhortatory, a ringing
call that blew the cobwebs out of a nation's conscience.;    Dimensions, a
company of six women and four men, makes the most of the varying abilities of
its members with high-intensity versions of traditional African dances. The
steps are not difficult, but the speed and intricacy of the execution are.;   
In "Amatshe," the "can dance" of women of Basotholand, and "Isicathulo," the
"boot dance" of Pondoland, the dancers invented a fast, fun, complex
percussion using, in the one, common tin cans; in the other, their knee-high
black rubber boots. Both were choreographed by Dingani Lelokoane.;    The
ensemble also performed "The King's Only Daughter," a jubilant suite of
Liberian dances put together and formalized by Nimely Napla. All these works
were done in costume to pulsing drum accompaniments by a live ensemble.;   
The program saw the premiere of artistic director Deborah Brooks Vaughan's
"Rediscovering Ntu," a Bantu word for unity and commonality. The piece,
however, was an overlong procession of uninspired shrugs and slinks, performed
in skimpy athletic clothes to a loud and unmelodious score, "Ntu the Ninth
Wonder," by the Nova Ghost Sect-tet, led by Ghasem Batamuntu.;    All done on
one guitar;  Anyone who's heard Jordan's Grammy-nominated single, "What's
Goin' On," may not realize that his contrapuntal guitar playing is not done by
superimposed multiple tracks. He plays everything on one guitar, using both
hands on its neck to play melodies, chordal accompaniments and jazz
extrapolation. It's really amazing to watch.;    He played two of his own
compositions and "Autumn Leaves," "Eleanor Rigby" and "Georgia on My Mind,"
each more virtuosic than the last. But it wasn't virtuosity for its own sake;
this was astonishing musicianship at work.;    Dimensions, dancing to
"Georgia," seemed inspired by Jordan's artistry. Vaughan's choreography had a
summery, smoky sensuality to it, emphasized by the women's sun dresses, the
loose movements and the late afternoon sunshine by lighting designer Stephanie
Johnson.  </TEXT>
