THE NEW EDITH HEADS OF HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

THEY SPEND MORE TIME looking through fashion magazines and history books than 
sketching. They devote hours to shopping at Bullock's, Saks Fifth Avenue and 
Western Costume. They scour garage sales and downtown clothing shops in search 
of the perfect icon of an era. These scavengers of style are the new breed of 
costume designers, the new Edith Heads of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Head, who lavishly costumed more than 1,000 films for Paramount and Universal 
and won eight Academy Awards, began her career in the 1920s and worked until 
her death in 1981. During her heyday, the '30s and '40s, quality workmanship 
was affordable, and fashion trends, such as padded shoulders, were born on the 
screen. Today, independent costume designers are limited by labor costs and 
movie realism. Often, rather than create original garments, they opt to adapt 
what they buy off the rack. 
</P>
<P>
But the glamour isn't lost. Costume design is still a business played out under 
the spotlight. Working with the world's top actors and directors, the new 
designers wield the creative power to shape, via costume, today's box-office 
hits. Most of the designers featured here have been nominated for Academy 
Awards, but none has won. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
AGGIE GUERARD RODGERS 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, Aggie Guerard Rodgers lived the San Joaquin Valley life that 
George Lucas captured in his 1973 film, "American Graffiti." So it made sense 
that she landed the costume designer's job. Besides, no one else would work 
within Lucas' skimpy $4,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
The film's madras shirts and pleated skirts were an auspicious start for 
Rodgers, who is now 46 and has a master's degree in costume design from Cal 
State Long Beach. She went on to bigger films, including "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest," the Best Picture of 1975, "The Return of the Jedi," which had a 
costume budget of $800,000, and "The Color Purple," for which she earned her 
first Academy Award nomination. 
</P>
<P>
For "Beetlejuice," Rodgers stretched her imagination to dress Michael Keaton 
who, as a demon wandering hell and earth, appears in a wild black-and-white 
suit. One scene called for Keaton's arms to turn into hammers and his head to 
become a carousel, so Rodgers worked with technicians to fit mechanical devices 
inside the garment. Special effects also required Rodgers to carefully design 
the pajamas worn by Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Witches 
of Eastwick." Cut-away duplicates had to accommodate harnesses used during 
flight scenes. 
</P>
<P>
In all of her projects, Rodgers uses a piece of her late mother's wardrobe. For 
"I Love You to Death," which opens soon, she included her mother's jewelry in a 
dinner scene. Says Rodgers: "I'm very sentimental." 
</P>
<P>
DEBORAH NADOOLMAN 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Nadoolman, who cut her teeth on television costume design, scrounged up 
black Ray-Ban shades for Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi in the 1980 film "The 
Blues Brothers," and a Wayfarer trend was born. In 1981, she outfitted Harrison 
Ford in his battered flight jacket and fedora for "Raiders of the Lost Ark." 
And in 1982, she created the red-and-black leather jacket for Michael Jackson's 
"Thriller" video. It's no coincidence that safari gear and the leather look 
have been popular ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had tremendous luck," says the 37-year-old wife of director John Landis. 
"The clothes I've designed have gone on to become part of the popular culture." 
Last year, the jacket that Nadoolman distressed by hand with a wire brush for 
"Raiders" earned a place in the entertainment collection of the Smithsonian 
Institution's Museum of American History. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Nadoolman, who holds a master's degree in costume design from 
UCLA, worked on Eddie Murphy's "Coming to America." For the modern fairy tale, 
she fashioned what she calls the "African ascot" look, combining ethnic motifs 
and '50s couture silhouettes. "The goal was to establish the enormity of 
Zamunda's wealth," she says of the fictitious country. The result was a tuxedo 
topped by an ocelot skin, complete with cubic zirconium eyes; crown jewels of 
real pearls, semiprecious stones and paste diamonds -- and Nadoolman's first 
Academy Award nomination.

<P>
MARILYN VANCE-STRAKER 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Vance-Straker, 42, is known as a modern-day costume designer because 
many of her films, such as "The Breakfast Club," "Die Hard" and "Uncle Buck," 
take place in the undefined present. The contemporary stories pose problems 
that period pieces don't. Because most wardrobes are designed at least 18 
months before the film is released, "you have to anticipate trends or avoid 
them because otherwise the film looks dated," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Quick problem-solving is Vance-Straker's forte, so she was disappointed but 
prepared when disaster struck Brian De Palma's "The Untouchables." "After the 
longest wait, we got the suits from Giorgio Armani in Italy -- $200,000 worth, 
mind you -- and then we spent the next 72 days remaking every inch," she 
recalls. "The shape of the lapels, the pads in the shoulders, the pocket 
treatments, the sleeves, the width of the pant legs, even the lining -- nothing 
worked." Though Armani demanded on-screen credit, her rescue effort brought her 
first Academy Award nomination. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and a former 
sportswear designer, Vance-Straker usually works on three films a year. 
"Sometimes the amount of time you spend is purely determined by the bottom 
line," she says. "If the producers can afford you for only two weeks, you give 
them all you've got for 14 days. You approach every film as if it's going to be 
a major hit, so every film is your best effort." 
</P>
<P>
ELLEN MIROJNICK 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Mirojnick is as interested in characters' psyches as she is in their 
costumes. So, long before the 40-year-old designer sits down at her drawing 
table, she explores "how they feel about love and hate, why they feel the way 
they do." Her character analysis has determined the costumes for "The Flamingo 
Kid," "Cocktail," "Talk Radio" and Steven Spielberg's latest release, "Always." 
</P>
<P>
She has become linked to Michael Douglas, whom she has dressed in three films 
-- not bad for someone who was thrown out of the Parsons School of Design for 
flunking pattern-making.To turn him into the unscrupulous Gordon Gekko in "Wall 
Street," Mirojnick researched men in similar jobs and then embellished reality. 
Where she found classic suspenders, a plain white shirt and a simple paisley 
tie, she replaced them with ostentatious striped braces with white leather 
attachments, a notice-me blue shirt with a white collar and an I-dare-you 
brocade tie. 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast are the somber black wardrobes of at least two of her other 
films. For "Fatal Attraction," Mirojnick designed to foreshadow Douglas' 
psychological state as a cheating husband whose lover is out to kill him: "His 
spirits got darker and darker as the story progressed, and so did the clothes." 
For "Black Rain," Mirojnick styled clothing to emphasize Douglas' hostility as 
a no-nonsense detective: "It was important that he feel like a tough guy, so I 
gave him tight clothes and slick textures. The leather jacket was the obvious 
choice."
