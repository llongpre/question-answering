   A difficult and sultry opera aria by
Miss Oklahoma and Miss Louisiana's ``super'' swimsuit helped win
them first honors in preliminary competition at the Miss America
Pageant.
   Lori Lee Kelley, a music student at Oklahoma City University,
sang what she called a ``very tough'' aria Wednesday to win the
talent competition among her group of 17 first-round contestants.
   She won with her rendition of ``Una Voce Poco Fa'' from ``The
Barber of Seville,'' which the 23-year-old soprano said she's
practiced for three years.
   The Clinton, Okla., resident, who called her performance ``very
flirtatious,'' performed in a slinky gown, overlayed with sequined
patterns of gold, bronze and charcoal and a charcoal-colored
feathered flounce.
   ``I praised God. I just left it up to him,'' Miss Kelley said.
   Miss Louisiana Valerie Brossett, a 5-foot-8, 115-pound brunette
from West Monroe, took the first round swimsuit competition in her
group.
   Swimsuit winners often go on to win the Miss America title,
despite continuing criticism of that part of the pageant.
   Miss Brossett wore a white ``supersuit'' designed by Pat Hobson,
a Mississippi pageant official, to enhance the figure. The
supersuits were worn by 11 of 17 first-round competitors.
   The 21-year-old Miss Brossett said she hopes to become a lawyer,
a job in which she said she'll draw on the poise she picks up
modeling her swimsuit.
   ``A lawyer is the kind of person who's got to be ready for any
type of situation. So, I guess I am,'' the Northeast Louisiana
University senior said.
   ``I am physically fit. I feel good about myself,'' she said. ``I
guarantee it's going to help me when I get into that court.''
   Wednesday's competition was the first of three nights of
swimsuit, talent and evening gown rounds among three groups of 17
contestants each. The winners of the preliminary evening gown
competitions are kept secret to heighten the suspense for the
finals.
   In the preliminaries, talent counts for 50 percent, while the
other 50 percent is divided among the swimsuit, evening gown and
interview divisions.
   The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary
competitions and interviews with the judges will become finalists
competing on Saturday to succeed Miss America 1988 Kaye Lani Rae
Rafko.
