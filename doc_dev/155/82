   When next winter rolls around, no woman need
worry that she will be left out in the cold.
   Italian designers showing their fall-winter 1989-90 collections
here this week devote much of their creative talent to coats, from
the pratical polo to dramatic capes and elegant dusters.
   The cut is as generous as it is cozy. Ample sleeves, huge shawl
collars, and loosely pleated backs contribute to create a soft
flowing effect. Most often belted at the waist, these outer
coverings are either cropped at the hip, or so long they can double
as street sweepers.
   The favorite fabric is wool, but leather and shearling also play
heavily in the collections, not to mention fur, from fake to
extravagant mink.
   Colors are warm fall shades ranging from forest greens, to
vineyard reds and purples, to beiges and browns.
   The unpractical but dramatically stylish cape, often hooded like
a medieval friar's, also makes a comeback.
   Ferragamo and Genny, who showed Tuesday, midway through the
fashion week, count heavily on the coat for winter warmth.
   Ferragamo _ the Florentine family known for its town and country
chic and its shoes _ presented a chocolate colored duster with super
wide sleeves, tied at the waist, and a series of chic car coats with
bright gold buttons.
   On the whole, the Ferragamo collection was very smart and sporty,
with trim pants suits in black and white checkered patterns, and
patchwork leather blazers and knee-length skirts for daytime, and
sophisticated long sleeved silk jersey gowns, buttoned or unbuttoned
at the back with gold buttons for evening.
   Genny, designed by Versace but more subdued than his presentation
of micro miniskirts during his own collection Sunday night,
presented the most opulent coat wear seen thus far on the Milan
runway, in his series of lavish mink wraps.
   These unabashedly expensive creations, made up no doubt of
hundreds of skins to create the huge collar, ample sleeve and wide
swirling hemline, go against the current conservationist trend for
imitation furs in elegant styles, favored among others by Armani
(Emporio) and Moschino.
   The Genny collection was snappy and young with a wide variety of
pants ranging from man-tailored to tight-fitting jodhpurs, and
short-cropped jackets. Skirts were a mere four inches above the
knee, a conservative length for flamboyant Versace, but still had
his trademark tight derriere.
   Evening at Genny's is basically black, enriched by traditional
pearl accessories, or an enticing rhinestone embroidered bustier
peering out of a slinky chiffon gown.
