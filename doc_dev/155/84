   For anyone who played with toy Tonka trucks and dreamed about
what they would be like on real roads, there is an answer: the 1990
Toyota 4Runner 4-Door 4WD with V6 engine.
   This new 4Runner like an obliging toy will bound hills with ease,
slink down inclines in a stable, admiring way, and capably blaze
trails. Then, as many popular toys do, it will change personalities.
   For the ride home on regular roads, the 4Runner 4WD switches from
four-wheel-drive to two-wheel-rive with the touch of a gear shifter.
Here, the 3-liter, electronic fuel-injected V6 engine is truly
appreciated _ providing smooth, good acceleration in the test
vehicle, which also was equipped with a four-speed automatic
transmission. And, like all long-running toys, the 4Runner has a
reputation for durability.
   For the last three years, the 4Runner has finished first in its
class in J.D. Power &amp; Associates' compact truck satisfaction index.
In the most recent survey, in 1988, Toyota 4Runner owners said their
vehicle had few fit-and-finish problems at delivery, and they ranked
reliability high.
   The 1990 model is Toyota's first four-door version of the
4Runner, which has been sold in this country as a two-door since
late 1983. But more than just two doors have been added.
   The new 4Runner marks the second generation of the 4Runner and
features a more rounded exterior, an upscale interior, and
shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive that can be engaged in speeds of
up to 50 mph. It appears to be a new generation of promise.
   The test vehicle was capable where it counted on all kinds of
roads, over many kinds of bumps and holes, and at different speeds.
A new suspension, including a four-link coil spring system in the
rear, gave a stable feel to the handling, though Toyota warned in
its owner's manual that the 4Runner _ like all sport utility
vehicles _ maneuvers differently than a regular car and must be
driven carefully.
   The 4Runner had good ground clearance _ 10 inches _ to get over
rocks and stumps when off-roading. It came in handy, too, when
someone left a truck tire in the middle of a highway lane during the
test drive.
   Of course, the 4Runner's high profile _ the door handles were
above my waist _ also made for some interesting maneuvering of my
own as I scampered inside. Thankfully, getting out was easier, just
sliding, sliding, sliding down.
   Superb described the fit and finish inside and out. And Toyota
wants to make sure the vehicle stays in top form. The automaker uses
greater amounts of galvanized steel on the new model, a coated
frame, chip resistant paint, specially shaped rocker panels and
special wax coat on hinges to protect against the elements.
   Inside, the optional cloth sport seats in front, the decent
legroom in back and generally pleasant surroundings made the outside
elements seem distant.
   Even the inside roof was cloth-covered in the test 4Runner.
   The rear cargo area behind the split rear seat was nicely
carpeted, with attention given to carpeting the rounded tops of the
wheel wells back there. It was a spacious cargo area, even with the
rear seats not folded down.
   The rear window of the 4Runner slides down electrically with the
turn of the key in the rear door or from the inside with the touch
of a button on the center console next to the driver. There's also a
button on the console to lock the window, so it can't be
accidentally opened.
   The rear door folds down outward, is carpeted and makes a nice
shelf for tailgating at football games.
   But the 4Runner test vehicle wasn't cheap. Base price for the
1990 4Runner 4Door 4WD SR5 V6 _ the official name of the tester _
was more than $19,000, including automatic transmission. With
options and delivery charge, it totaled more than $22,000. And
that's without power windows, power locks and cassette player.
   In contrast, Ford said its large, two-door Bronco
four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle with six-cylinder engine,
three-speed automatic transmission, air conditioning and many other
options on the 4Runner would total about $18,000.
   You can find a lower-priced 4Runner _ with a manual transmission
and a four-cylinder engine _ with a base price of more than $15,400.
   Toyota expects the new 4Runner to attract a different crowd than
the previous one. Prior buyers were predominantly male with median
age of 32. Sixty-nine percent were married, 44 percent were college
graduates, and the average income was $44,000.
   Company spokesman Mike Michaels said Toyota expects the number of
women buyers to increase with the new model because it will be a
more attractive package for adventurous families. Michaels also said
Toyota expects to attract an older, higher-income crowd.
   Sales of 4Runners last year totaled 28,000 and had been tapering
downward for a couple years, Michaels said. But he added that Toyota
hopes to double, even triple sales once the new model takes hold.
   Consumer Report magazine did not have a listing for owner reports
on the 4Runner.
