   Christian-in-Wonderland did it again.
   After the patchwork blaze of color in his winter ready-to-wear
collection last week, Christian Lacroix topped his own act Sunday
with a second show, the more expensive and sublime ``luxe''
collection.
   Often capping the outfits with his favorite ``Mad Hatter'' hat,
he showed rich clothes in the line he nicknamed ``jogging to
Byzantium.''
   Lacroix led off with a bronze taffeta belted trench coat with a
grand fox collar, followed up by a tangerine long wraparound skirt
topped with a beaver-collared raspberry jacket.
   Soft imitation leopard added more deluxe touches to jacket
linings, big stoles and an occasional turban cap.
   Little short fitted suits with flared bell skirts came out in
stained-glass shades of Persian Killim rug patterns.
   His favorite trapeze-shaped topper looked great with deep mink
cuffs on hot orange-red bouclette wool over a mildly flared skirt.
   A fabulous, egg-shaped, carnation pink, iridescent taffeta coat
over a salmon satin suit was breathtaking.
   For evening wear, rich women might choose the strapless dresses
in ``Fortuny'' panne velvets with strapless bosoms draped in lame.
   The gold of Byzantium was shot through the collection, even for
evening blazers with paisley patterns in the brocade. And Goldfinger
himself couldn't have faulted the shimmering lame trouser outfit
with flared pants.
   Never one to shy away from color and opulence, Lacroix laid on
both in plenty, especially for evening. But he did it with such a
light touch that the audience was dazzled.
   The grand finale was a group of Oriental ``odalisque'' outfits
with harem pants in turquoise, red and gold iridescent panne velvets.
   Meanwhile, this versatile designer is already well into his next
project: designing 350 costumes for a spectacular production of
``Carmen'' to take place in early July in the ancient arena at
Nimes, near Lacroix's native Arles in Provence.
   This time, he's putting all his inventiveness into costumes for
the American stars of the opera, Grace Bumbry and Neil Shicoff,
singing ``Carmen'' and ``Don Jose.''
   ``I grew up with Carmen, a very sexy lady and the first woman in
my life,'' Lacroix said in an interview. ``Her outfits will be in
gold and white, coral shades and earth colors, depending on the
act.''
   One sure thing: with Lacroix dressing her, Miss Bumbry won't look
like the down-and-out cigarette girl she will play.
   Japanese designer Hanae Mori showed a gently demure collection
under the rotunda of the old commodities market.
   The most ``French'' of Oriental designers and the only one to
show haute couture as well went in strongly for feminine shapes and
soft fabrics.
   Her navy pinstriped coat-dresses, suits with skirts and pants
couldn't have been more classic.
   Diagonally-striped black and turquoise knit outfits were lively
but never out of line, lengths just around knee level.
   Like designers all over town, Miss Mori is seeing spots for next
winter, and imitation leopard surged up here in flyaway trapeze
shortie coats over narrow black skirts and animal-spotted stockings.
   For a touch of hot jazz, she showed puffy Tibetan lamb coats dyed
in amethyst, royal blue and shocking pink.
   Iridescent taffeta dresses with cloche-shaped skirts over mounds
of crinolines harked back to tea-dances for debutantes in the 1950s.
   More interesting were the evening outfits in Hanae Mori's forte,
flower-printed silks. This time they were beautiful and bold, in
turquoise, peacock, flame with gold, borrowed from the best of
Japanese kimono fabrics.
   On Easter Sunday, Miss Mori will celebrate the opening of her new
shop in Monte Carlo, by presenting the collection at a charity gala
for ``Les Oeuvres de Soeur Marie,'' which benefits underprivileged
and elderly people. Princess Caroline will host the event for about
700 guests.
   Maryll Lanvin's collection was eclectic, bright and attractive,
aimed at women who frequent the best shops, clubs and restaurants.
As usual, the clothes were young and well-cut, mainstream rather
than trend-setting.
   Navy and big bands of violet piping were combined happily in a
daytime group that had short flannel skirts, pants, shetland blazers
and boleros.
   Worth noting were her big, bold diagonal plaids, in shades of
yellow, red, emerald, purple. Fuzzy plaid mohair coats and flyaway
short trapeze coats looked outstanding over suits with long shetland
jackets and lean dark skirts.
   Another new plaid was multicolored windowpane style on a dark
boucle fabric. It was striking in suits with both pants and short or
longer skirts - the easy alternatives here.
   The shimmering dresses with hip-bloused tops and leg o'mutton
sleeves or shifts were looked pleasingly different in their outsized
paisley patterns.
   Sleekly fitted moire dresses in gem colors with short skirts
flaring at the hem are made to order for little dinners or big
cocktail parties.
   And Lanvin's late-day wear was best in fitted quilted silk
jackets with splatter motifs on very bright colors over dark silk
jersey skirts or flowing pajamas.
