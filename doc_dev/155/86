   Imagine Donald Duck and Daffy Duck playing a madcap piano duet
together, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny falling airily from the sky
and Betty Boop in a nightclub lamenting she is a black-and-white
has-been while her rivals appear in color.
   Imagine just about every movie cartoon star you've ever seen,
and you've got the supporting cast of Touchstone Pictures, ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit.'' It is one of the cleverest feats of
legerdemain ever to appear on a movie screen.
   All hands _ and the credits run longer than those of ``Star
Wars'' _ are to be congratulated for their talent and, no doubt,
patience. It is staggering to contemplate the amount of hours
required to pull off such a stunt.
   Suspension of belief is necessary at the outset. The moviemakers
would have us believe that in 1947 Hollywood there was a place
called Toon Town, where all the cartoon characters worked. Not only
worked, but lived, breathed and intermingled with humans and
filmmakers who put their cartoons together.
   We see this at the very beginning, when a comic named Roger
Rabbit is blowing a scene with co-star Baby Herman. The human
director bawls out Roger and calls lunch. Studio boss R.K. Maroon
(Alan Tilvern) hires the seedy, booze-slugging private eye Eddie
Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to discover what is troubling Roger.
   It seems that Roger worries that he is being two-timed by his
wife, a slinky siren with a battleship chest. Hoskins reluctantly
takes the job and soon finds there is more trouble in Toon Town
than anyone suspected. A cadaverous, black-cloaked ``judge''
(Christopher Lloyd) is trying to gain control of the studios so he
can sell them for a freeway. He is aided by a gang of blood-thirsty
weasels.
   The guiding force behind ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' was
undoubtedly Robert Zemeckis, who directed the last big success for
Steven Spielberg, ``Back to the Future.'' Aided by a witty script
by Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman, Zemeckis retains control
throughout what must have been an agonizingly complicated
production.
   Never have animation and live action combined so seamlessly.
Director of animation Richard Johnson and his artists deserve high
praise for their achievement, meanwhile maintaining the integrity
of the many cartoon stars.
   Bob Hoskins is perfect as the hapless gumshoe, eloquently
expressing fear, outrage and occasional compassion. Joanna Cassidy
is equally effective as his long-suffering moll. Christopher Lloyd,
scarcely recognizable as the evil mastermind, is an ideal villain.
   OK, so ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' is masterfully produced, but
is it hilarious? Not very often. There are some funny gags, as when
Hoskins enters a Toon Town night club with the password: ``Walt
sent me.'' The cartoon gags are the standard ones of gravity
defiance and sock! bam! pow!
   The most fun is the appearance of long-loved characters in new
settings. A hippo ballerina from ``Fantasia'' sits down on a studio
bench and a man on the other end zooms into space. Dumbo flies
outside a second-floor window and the studio boss throws peanuts to
him.
   ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' was produced by Robert Watts and
Frank Kennedy with Steven Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy as
executive producers. The rating is PG, with lots of scary stuff to
frighten the very young. Running time: 103 minutes.
