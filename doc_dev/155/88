<LEADPARA>  DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, but for me the most terrifying words of my teen-age
years -- worse than the phrase Junior Prom or the initials SAT -- were "swim
party." At 14 or 15, your adult shape only partially and still imperfectly
assembled, an invitation to a swim party means you will be seen in a bathing
suit by persons of the opposite sex.;    My first swim party happened in July.
I was 14. I was with three other girls and four boys on a little beach on the
shore of a brackish, jellyfish-filled little river that emptied into the
Chesapeake Bay. I remember thinking: "Should I lie on my back so that my
stomach looks flatter, or should I lie on my stomach, so my bust looks bigger?
Or should I go in the water with the jellyfish?" I chose the least painful --
swimming.  </LEADPARA>

BATHING SUIT ANXIETY FALLS INTO THE GENDER

<TEXT>     One hundred percent of the women I asked to remember the first time they
appeared in public in a bathing suit round about teenhood said, "It was
awful," or "I felt awful," or "I wanted to die," or "I still haven't gotten
over it," or "It was too traumatic for me to remember.";    In this as in
other regards, men are different. From the men I asked there came pro forma
responses like, "Back then I was embarrassed because I didn't have enough
chest hair," or "I thought my legs were too thin." But in a way that was both
miraculous and suspicious, men very quickly got over those anxious memories
about chest hair. If pushed just the tiniest bit, they moved rapidly to
remembering what they really liked about that first swim party, which was
getting to look at girls in bathing suits.;    Everyone alive has the sense
that some part of their body doesn't measure up, and on some days the whole
package is not up to the job. But men who think fairly well of themselves in
general -- high math aptitude scores, several appointments to Cabinet
positions, and so on -- don't worry too much about how they look in bathing
suits. Women, no matter how good they feel about themselves, think that some
part of their body, if not the whole thing, looks awful in a bathing suit.;   
Henry Kissinger, typical male, feels pretty good about himself in general and
this feeling spills over into his bathing suit demeanor. He goes down to
Acapulco and he puts on a bathing suit. Does Kissinger say, "I think I'd
better lie on my back, so that my stomach looks flatter?" I doubt it. In fact,
men seem remarkably unencumbered by shame where bathing suits are concerned.; 
  Women not only remember that first bathing suit experience, but all those
feelings of embarrassment and inadequacy can come flooding back, in full
teen-age intensity, in a moment.; HAT BROUGHT MY OWN youthful anxiety back was
an encounter at Nordstrom. God knows those salespeople work at being nice, and
the woman in Women's Active meant no harm when she told me that the people who
design bathing suits thought it was a good idea for bathing suits to be worn
to social events.;    "Something like this," she said, holding up a turquoise
satinish Anne Klein one-piece suit, "you could wear with this top," she said,
holding up a transparent turquoise chiffonish shirt, "for a poolside party
with people from the office.";    With people from the office! A thought too
horrible to contemplate in all its variety. To be exposed up to the hip bone
and down to the cleavage in the presence of people you may be criticized by,
may ask for a raise, may be competing for a promotion with, may have a crush
on.;    The idea, the saleswoman went on, is that you fling a matching top or
skirt over the slinky bathing suit containing your finely toned, evenly tanned
body, and there you are, efficiently and gorgeously attired for the boss's
poolside dinner.;    The fatal flaw here is that even the women in the Sports
Illustrated bathing suit issue, even this month's Cosmopolitan cover girl,
even women who model bathing suits for a living would not feel at ease in a
bathing suit at a dinner party with friends from the office or the modeling
studio or whatever. Even the underfed and over-exercised Miss Georgias and
Miss Alaskas who teeter down the Atlantic City runway on Barbie-high heels
feel they must dab makeup on their knees and do God knows what with
depilatory.;    Even women whose bodies are very nice-looking worry. Think
back to Esther Williams. The woman's wrist and hand actions were unequaled,
her diving was top-notch, but her thighs were not all that great. Good, but
not great. Dorothy Lamour had the good sense to wear a sarong. (For the first
time, in 1936, in The Jungle Princess.) Ask a Las Vegas showgirl, ask one of
the Bluebelles performing somewhere in Montmartre, ask Blaze Starr. They'd all
be too shy to appear in bathing suits in front of people they knew.;    The
people who feel happy at events where women are required to wear swimsuits are
not women.;    Almost everyone, regardless of sex, feels anxious about
undressing. There are a few archetypal anxiety dreams, the stuff of chapters
by Carl Jung and moviesby Ingmar Bergman. Foremost among these dreams is the
one that almost everyone has at some time or other: You are inappropriately
dressed or stark naked at a social event.;    Rather repressed people wake up
screaming from dreams in which they're wearing brown shoes with black pants at
their cousin's evening wedding. Others dream of being completely naked except
for a pair of navy mid-heel pumps, asking our bosses for a 50 percent raise.; 
  But, for women, various market forces seem to be at work to make their
nightmares about inappropriate and unflattering clothes come true. It was just
last year that we began to be able to live with bathing suit legs slashed
nearly to the waist. If we weren't used to the look, we found some way around
it -- the overpriced Norma Kamali in gray sweat-shirt material with 1940s
legs, or the 10-year-old Speedo.;    The fashion news of 1991 is that
designers, entranced by the slinky fabrics that bathing suits are made of, and
buyers, eager to make you think you need six bathing suits for six different
social events (wedding receptions, confirmations, bar mitzvahs, retirement
parties) are supplying and stocking the stores with strapless bathing suits
coated with rhinestones, to be accompanied by transparent tops. This terrible
trend began in the chemistry labs, with research for better living leading to
the introduction of nylon in 1938 and then latex and finally spandex. These
shiny and swanky cloths suggest evening wear, so you can see how designers got
led astray. The idea of bathing suits for social events was widely introduced
in 1963, when Annette and Frankie were paired in Beach Party. Annette
Funicello's thighs, if I remember correctly, were not above reproach. And
Frankie could have used a little more chest hair.;    Bad enough you should be
seen for the 13-second run from towel or chair to water. But to stand around
with a drink in your hand, having your colleagues from work thinking, "Gosh,
how could someone who really looks perfectly OK in regular clothes . . . ?"
Designers recognize our anxiety, and here is one big clue. In that Nordstrom
Women's Active department, there was a tag hanging on a Gottex turquoise suit
with spangles. The tag, from the cosmetic company Clarins, urged the purchase
of a product for "Serious Cellulite Control," a product called "Multi-Minceur
Anti-Capiton." To hope that applying some French cream to your thighs will get
rid of cellulite is like believing that rubbing Ben-Gay on your back will
clear up your disk trouble.;    There could be a conspiracy to lock women into
a cycle of anxiety. Nervousness about how you're going to look in a bathing
suit sends you to exercise class and starts you dieting. When you realize the
pathetic inadequacy of the idea of spot reduction, you rush out to buy
Multi-Minceur.;    "Summer is coming," says the sadistic aerobics instructor
as she pushes you to your 137th leg lift. When she says summer is coming she
is not referring to any worry about appearing in a sleeveless blouse, or
sandals, or a big straw hat. She's pushing the bathing-suit fear button.;   
When you might be enjoying the hamstring exercises for themselves, the
instructor begins to talk about the gluteal fold, and says those terrible
words, "You'll thank me for this." I talked to a woman who spends two or three
hours a day in a bathing suit. A competitive swimmer, she thought she looked
awful to men. They don't, she thinks, like big shoulders, boyish hips, and
bulky thighs.;    Obviously, for women, a bathing suit represents the main
event, the big test, and most women face this test feeling that they will
never be good enough. Women can trick themselves into feeling as competent or
adequate or attractive or gifted as they are, when they're wearing a
well-tailored red jacket. But it's impossible for a woman to make herself feel
invincible in a bathing suit; there is just too much skin area to be covered.
And the bikini wax problem, and your toenails, and your shoulder blades.;   
Men, after all, are much more protected by their bathing suits. Unless they've
made the mistake of getting one of those nylon Euro-bikinis, they're wearing
the equivalent of shorty pajamas.;    There is however one place where almost
any woman is comfortable as a man wearing a bathing suit -- in the water.;   
So there is one sane response to this summer's fashion news: Go out and swim
in your bathing suit.;    Designers working on the 1992 line should be
advised: A bathing suit should be comfortable, with straps that don't fall
down. It should not be particularly shark-attracting. It should dry quickly.
That's it. That's about the sum of what's needed.;    What about those for
beach or poolside or lakeside social events? The answer is: compulsory muumuus
for both men and women.;    Men naturally would develop some kind of power
muumuu. Red with a yellow slash, blue-and-white striped and frayed oxford
cloth with a sedate wine-red sash. Or a little number in sweat-shirt gray that
would indicate where you went to business school. Women would start out with
flowered versions, but before long they'd start wearing navy power muumuus,
too.;    The inevitable problem of status-linked or sex-specific muumuus has
its solution, too. Something that everyone looks good in. Something that
everyone looks tan in. Something that makes everyone equal through the middle,
and makes everyone feel comfortable. By making this article of clothing
compulsory for swimming parties, we can greatly reduce, if not completely
eliminate, bathing-suit-linked anxiety. The great equalizer: the white terry
cloth robe.;    Imagine the rush to the newsstands in March to buy the Sports
Illustrated special White Terry Cloth Robe issue, in which beautiful models
show off their gorgeous faces, necks and ankles.  </TEXT>
