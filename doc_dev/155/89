   It's the big switch, the great turn-about, a
joke on death. Ancient imagery has the resurrected Christ
confronting the Devil and laughing at him about it.
   That's a little known aspect of Easter lore, the zanily
uproarious, upside down funniness of a holiday Christians celebrate
this weekend.
   ``Blessed are you that weep now, for you shall laugh,'' Jesus
said, and the Fellowship of Merry Christians seeks to restore that
bubbling note of laughter to the occasion.
   The ``joke that God played on Satan by raising Jesus from the
dead was indisputably the greatest and most imaginative practical
joke in the history of the world,'' says Carl Samra.
   Samra of Box 668, Kalamazoo, Mich., is coordinator of the
ecumenical fellowship, grown to about 10,000 members, and editor of
its news-and-joke bimonthly, ``The Joyful Noiseletter.''
   The fellowship, which sees humor and delight in faith and
circulates comic anecdotes about it, wants to resurrect an old
Christian custom _ celebrating ``Bright Monday'' _ a day for merry
pranks and frolic.
   Also called ``White Monday,'' it comes the day after Easter, and
according to the fellowship, used to be celebrated as a ``day of
joy and laughter'' by Roman Catholic, Protestant and Eastern
Orthodox believers.
   It's a time for ``the laughing of the redeemed, the dancing of
the liberated,'' writes noted German Protestant theologian Jurgen
Moltman.
   As Jesus put it, ``your sorrow will turn into joy.'' He
reassured his apostles ``that my joy may be in you and that your
joy may be full.''
   Such passages inspired artist R. S. Riddick of Tucson, Ariz., to
paint his sketch of Jesus smiling, ``The Joyful Christ.'' Another
painting, ``Jesus Laughing,'' is by Willis Wheatley of Praise
Screen Prints, Traverse City, Mich.
    The Fellowship of Merry Christians sponsors its ``Holy Humor
Month'' in April, with Monday set for a day of happy festivities _
picnics, singing, dancing, telling jokes and fun.
   Mrs. Soule Papademetriou, librarian at Orthodoxy's Holy Cross
School of Theology in Brookline, Mass., says that in early Greek
tradition, Easter Monday was a ``day of joy and laughter'' at
Christ's triumph over death.
   That zest, games and high spirits continued through ``Bright
Week,'' she says.
   Although origins of the celebration are hazy, she says, it may
have been inspired by an Easter midnight sermon by fourth-century
Greek preacher John Chrysostom who envisioned the resurrected
Christ laughing at the Devil.
   ``Hell was angered when it encountered thee (Christ) in the
lower regions...for it was mocked (ridiculed with laughter),''
Chrysostom said.
   An old adage has it that the Devil can't stand the sound of
laughter, and slinks away from it.
   Monsignor Arthur Tonne of Marion, Kan., a Roman Catholic priest
of 83 and author of five volumes of ``Jokes Priests Can Tell,''
says several Catholic orders have observed Monday as a day of fun.
   The Rev. Francis Weiser in ``The Easter Book,'' writes that in
early Christianty ``all of Easter Week was one continuous feast''
and Easter Monday remains a legal holiday in most European
countries.
   He says in medieval times, Easter Monday was a time of ``special
festivities,'' of ``Emmaus walks'' into the woods and fields for
pinics, folk dancing, singing and games.
   One sport was was called ``drenching,'' a good-natured game in
which boys and girls in outlandish costumes doused each other or
their families with buckets or bottles of water, reciting playful
ditties.
   A Protestant custom in England was ``heaving.'' Groups of men
carrying a chair aloft would go from house to house, getting a lady
to sit in the chair, then lifting her three times, shouting
hurrahs, demanding forfeit of a kiss.
   During this ``Holy Humor Month,'' the fellowship urges divided
Christians to be, in the word's of the apostle Paul, ``fools for
Christ,'' to see the follies of their divisions and work for
Christian unity.
   That was what Jesus prayed for on the night before his
crucifixion that led to his resurrection _ that ``all may be one so
that the world may believe.''
