   From classic elegance at Givenchy to skin-tight and
slinky jerseys at Tarlazzi, styles in Friday's fashion shows for
next summer ran the gamut.
   Tailored, ruffled, draped, and bare-midriff looks took over the
runways as the fashion picture was unfocused.
   Givenchy had his act together, a sophisticated range of clothes
that looked worthy of the elder statesman of couture.
   But the clothes were far from elderly. Givenchy simply took some
of his favorite themes and brought them out in luxurious fabrics.
He firmly padded shoulders for shape, ignoring the softer shoulders
elsewhere. There were lots of short skirts and easy long pants, in
plaid or solid suits with fitted or bolero tops. The suits were
handsome in windowpane plaids, stripes or glen plaids in silks,
linens and cottons.
   Simple sheaths with big padded cap sleeves or off-the-shoulder
banded tops with huge puffy sleeves over narrow short skirts added
to the range of feminine silhouettes for summer.
   There were navy, gray and neutrals for daytime, with sizzling
colors for later on. They came out in gazar or organza outfits with
big flounces, flowered prints, shades of orange, pink, wisteria and
turquoise, sometimes decorated with lily-of-the valley appliques or
sparkly fish just for fun.
   Karl Lagerfeld's ideas oozed with originality, all the clothes
cut for action from striped knit pullovers, long pants and shorts
to the fluid, full-skirted minis.
   Borrowing some of his own ideas from Chanel, where he's also
head designer, Lagerfeld sometimes paired big tweed checked blazers
with dark chiffon culottes and long skirts.
   Jackets were the forte, and whether short or long, they were
always fitted to the waist, and often had deeply cut lapels,
hugging the hips over contrasting short and lean skirts with
matching tights or the new, full minis. The best jacket had
crescent-shaped lapels _ one large, one small _ and for evening it
came out with pearled embroidery.
   Lagerfeld's prettiest cocktail clothes paired up black and white
short looks in bustier outfits with revealing black lace loose
jackets.
   Folklore and graphic prints with sequins and big polka-dotted
satins and cottons looked great too. Lagerfeld mixed them up in
tiny minis with fitted jackets, or in long, high-waisted pyjamas
and short or cutaway jackets.
   ``Come play with me,'' declared Angelo Tarlazzi in his program.
The Italian designer, who now also plies his trade for Guy Laroche
couture, went all out for hot-colored and clingy knits, leaving
little to the imagination. With elastic shoulder wraps, many bare
midriffs, pleated ruffles at the bust or hem, some of the viscose
knits were convertible _ and could be pulled out from mini length
to make a long dress.
   The most amusing evening dresses were called ``totems,'' and
combined bubbles of African-inspired prints in hot colors and black
with raffia fringes and fishnet hems.
   To emphasize the waist, he gave a girdle effect in lame
waist-cinchers to many outfits, with fullness in blouses above and
long pants or shorts below.
   Tarlazzi raided the linen closet for his ideas in summer white:
hem-stitched jackets and flounced skirts with boleros were a great
exercise in what you can do with sheets, napkins and tablecloths.
   Anne-Marie Beretta's daytime suits with mother of pearl buttons
or snaps on long jackets worn with pedal pushes or pleated skirts
looked a bit too strict for the pampered set that frequents the
Automobile Club, where the show was held.
   The outfits were better in light pastel linens, forest green and
petrol blue than in the rather sad shades of khaki, putty and muddy
brown that predominated.
   She draped lots of clothes rather awkwardly for daytime, giving
them a heavy look in front. But some of the taffeta and lace
evening drapes and big ruffles were opulent if not especially
feminine.
   Woodstock was reborn for Bernard Perris, who went back to the
1960s and '70s for his inspiration. His girls trotted out in
flared, funnel-shaped trousers, lots of embroidered and jeweled
hipster pants and skirts, and fringes all over the place.
   He also harked back to the age of Aquarius in his mixed Indian
cotton and silk prints in wrapped and draped skirts and
cummerbunds. And his idea of the tuxedo got all dressed up with
acres of long tassels.
   Bellbottomed pants, jumpsuits and shorts came out at Chloe, the
collection designed by Martine Sitbon. Her black pants suits or
short skirts with cutaway jackets were stitched with white, giving
nice vertical lines all over.
   The many cut-outs, bareback and bare-midriff outfits gave
another nod to the 1960s in this group of shows that seems to be
floundering as designers search for details and silhouettes for the
1990s.
