   CBS might as well come on the air Saturday night
and announce, ``Hey, Bonehead! The Olympics are on NBC! Why aren't
you watching!?''
   Instead, the network offers a remarkably lame study in the
obvious, ``Bodywatching,'' based on the Desmond Morris books on
body language.
   Did we know that the facial expression for joy is the same in
every culture _ a smile? Did we know that hands express emotion?
Did we know that hello is good-bye reversed?
   OF COURSE, WE DID! WE'RE NOT STUPID! GET TO THE SEX!
   The special actually reveals _ stop the presses _ how men's
bodies are different than women's. But this is network television,
so don't expect to see the good parts.
   ``Bodywatching'' starts off by examining the body language of
door-to-door salesmen. Rap pleasantly on the door, one vacuum
merchant suggests to another. Talk your way in the door. Make the
vacuum cleaner look easy to use.
   This is scientific?
   Eventually, ``Bodywatching'' slinks up to the subject it
constantly suggests, first with a woman who designs brassieres. She
says her job is not unlike designing a suspension bridge. ``You
have to somehow get the bust up!'' ``Push-up bras create curves
that are highly sexual!'' gushes narrator Burgess Meredith, whose
body language is thankfully unseen.
   On to a beach in Brazil _ hairy chests, string bikinis. ``Simply
put, it's really about mating!'' Meredith squeals.
   For some reason, much of the first half of the special is taken
up with following a blind sculptor to Italy where he gets to feel
Michelangelo's masterpiece, ``David.'' This is rather, er,
touching, but it doesn't seem to have much to do with body
language. ``Remember, Michael is blind!'' Meredith exclaims
irritatingly several minutes into the piece. Apparently the writers
think the viewers are, too.
   The best body language for ``Bodywatching'' is turning the
channel.

   If these are really the best young comedians of today, standup
comedy is doomed.
   HBO has scraped together a ``Twelfth Annual Young Comedians
Show,'' airing Sunday and Sept. 30. Past installments boast a
number of finds: Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Steve Martin, Paul
Reubens (Pee-wee Herman), Steven Wright and Louie Anderson, among
them.
   This time around, even host Paul Rodriguez isn't in particularly
fine form. The only standout of the five comics he introduces is
the closing act, Richard Jeni, and he isn't particularly special.
His bit about fighting in New York is pretty funny _ it takes 40
minutes to actually work up to violence, after various stages, such
as determining the opponent has a problem, as in, ``You got a
problem? Hey, what's your problem, man?''
   Cathy Radman trots out an old bit about crossing the Canadian
border for a gig only to get into a confused argument with a border
guard who thinks she said ``Canadian'' instead of ``comedian.'' If
Radman doesn't get some new material, there'll be no such problem.
   Paul Dillery has some decent material and a unique style. With
his baby face and slight figure, he says he once tried to get a job
in construction. ``The foreman looked at me and said, `You can have
the job. Just fill this out.' He handed me a shirt.''
   Rick Reynolds' litany of unhappy material _ he makes fun of a
grandfather with facial paralysis, for pity's sake _ eventually
sinks to dumb sex jokes interrupted line by line with his operatic
singing.
   Haywood Banks is embarrassingly desperate to cram his mish-mash
of material into a cohesive gimmick, so he dresses inexplicably
like a nerd. He pushes far beyond its potential one bit in which he
holds up a sign that says, ``This.'' ``Did you see this? Look at
this! What's this doing on the floor?'' He follows up with
``That,'' ``Something'' and ``Nothing.''
   Perhaps HBO should consider doing a young comedians show every
other year. Or every five years. Or ``as warranted.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   LAUGH ABOUT IT WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO CHOOSE _ A bunch of top-notch
comedians are getting together for an ABC special on Oct. 15 that
will endeavor to kid citizens into exercising their right to vote.
The two-hour special, ``An All-Star Celebration: The '88 Vote,''
stars Billy Crystal, Lily Tomlin, Robin Williams, Roseanne Barr,
George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Martin Mull and Jerry Seinfeld,
plus singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder, actor Lou Diamond Phillips
and musical group Cheap Trick. The special is being taped before a
live audience on the UCLA campus Oct. 10-11. ...
   A FINE ... OOPS _ Anthony Andrews has dropped out of the
upcoming ABC series ``A Fine Romance.'' Instead, another British
actor, Christopher Cazenove, formerly of ``Dynasty,'' will star
opposite Margaret Whitton in the screwball comedy filmed in Europe
about a married couple _ he English, she American _ who are
divorced but continue as co-hosts of a television series that takes
them to exotic locales and gets them involved in all sorts of
scrapes. The series has been delayed until mid-season because of
the Writers Guild strike this summer.
