"Try throwing a dinner party for two pinheads and a Cyclops," wails someone in 
Charles Busch's "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom" at the Coronet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Try inventing ridiculous names (Enid Wetwhistle? La Condesa de Scrofula de -- 
well, never mind). Try wearing the most soigne fright wigs this side of 
Halloween (creator is Elizabeth Katherine Carr). Try constructing the most 
ridiculous costumes (John Glaser) this side of "Beach Blanket Babylon." Try 
besting the late Charles Ludlam at his own Ridiculous Theatre game. 
</P>
<P>
Busch has. And then some. Can a show called "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom" 
(preceded by a curtain-raiser titled "Sleeping Beauty or Coma") be anything but 
camp transvestism punctuated by blatantly, ostentatiously vulgar jokes? Of 
course not. The title tells you so. But Busch's and director Kenneth Elliott's 
Theatre-in-Limbo company (which is anything but) delivers on its promise. This 
is a theater of knobby knees, winks, tongues in cheeks, eye-liners and 
one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Theater to gross out by. 
</P>
<P>
No cow is sacred, especially not Hollywood or Las Vegas. (No joke is sacred 
either. "This isn't hair on my head, these are nerve-endings," used here, first 
came out of Phyllis Diller's mouth on a verrrry early appearance on the Jack 
Paar show!) But then the plots are as outlandish as the play titles and mere 
devices for spoofing anything within shooting range. In the case of "Sleeping 
Beauty," it's haute couture; in "Vampire" it's Dracula and silent screen stars. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, these are characters in search of excuses for great get-ups and 
off-color jokes. "Sleeping Beauty" is a more limited effort than "Vampire 
Lesbians," but both are live-wire examples of the Ludlam/Ridiculous tradition, 
which explains "Vampire's" ongoing success Off-Broadway (it's been packing them 
in at the Provincetown Playhouse since 1985). 
</P>
<P>
Busch is the fulcrum. Prettier than Ludlam, he plays several female parts -- 
roles -- to confectionary perfection. He revels in Sarah Bernhardt-style 
asides, batting eyelashes and topping himself from one wig to the next. His 
Madeleine Astarte, silent-screen vamp, looks and acts like a case of genetic 
tampering between Lucille Ball and Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Aulino protests too much as frantic designer Sebastian Lore in "Sleeping 
Beauty." But Andy Halliday (the prim Miss Thick in "Sleeping Beauty" and 
Etienne the butler in "Vampire") has a face made for caricature. His mouth 
looks like something that happened when the slasher missed his throat. 
</P>
<P>
It's not all up to the men, however. The real women in this cast make some of 
the strongest contributions. Monica Horan is memorable as Anthea Arlo in the 
curtain-raiser and as starlet Renee Vain in "Vampire." But it is blonde Julie 
Halston who really takes it away as "Sleeping Beauty's" flaky Enid and 
"Vampire's" slinkily-attired Succubus and growling Condesa -- an imperious 
movie queen in perpetual high dudgeon. ("I have reason to believe La Condesa is 
one of the undead" -- "No, darling, she just looks that way." Yes, it's that 
kind of humor. Low.) 
</P>
<P>
Sets and lights (B.T. Whitehill and Vivien Leone, respectively) are incidental 
to this show, which is fundamentally (accent on the first syllable) and 
deliberately all about costume, camp and coarseness. 
</P>
<P>
Not for all markets, but certainly for certain markets. Rarely has a show been 
better suited to the dingy, dark, mildly decadent ambience of the Coronet. A 
few months ago, one might have added the word decrepit too, but the management 
has spruced up the place some. 
</P>
<P>
All the more reason to expect that "Vampire Lesbians," with its guaranteed cult 
status, might run on and on, ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., Tuesdays through Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 7 and 
10 p.m.; Sundays, 3 and 7:30 p.m. Indefinitely. Tickets: $18-$22; (213)

"Vampire Lesbians of Sodom." ELLEN JASKOL / Los Angeles Times; Photo, FAITH AND 
GOMORRAH: Charles Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatre echoes thunderously in Charles 
Busch's "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom." If it's gay camp you want, those vampire 
queens at the Coronet Theatre -- Busch, above, plays most of the female leads 
-- are laying it on with a trowel.
