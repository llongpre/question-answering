PARLIAMENT, wrote psychologist and former Welsh Labour MP Leo Abse, is a
Mecca 'for all those who wish, even as they did in their nurseries but now
without fear of disapproval, to scream with anger, spit at their enemies,
attack opponents, boldly hit out at wrongs, real and imagined.
'Like moths around a flame, the aggressive flutter around Westminster.'
He should know. The violently-coloured shirts and bowler hats he wore on
Budget days in the 1960s stood out like a Red Admiral in a field of corn. He
wanted to convey a message about something more pugnacious than fiscal
stabilisers.
Politics is about individualism, a bid for attention. Dress is integral and
sends out signals. It has to resonate with a politician's convictions - and,
to be successful, that usually means distinctive. 'If you put Lady Thatcher
into Laura Ashley it would interrupt what she was saying,' says Barbara
Follett, past couturier to Labour's frontbench. 'Individuality is the most
important factor when choosing what to wear. It is a mistake to look like an
IBM executive clone.'
More than any other professional, the politician is constantly visible - to
local voters or colleagues they want to impress, to lobby journalists
practising their own peculiar school of political lepidopterology, and,
above all, to the television cameras. Bright media lights capture, as their
first image, a politician's attire.
Chosen in pre-dawn darkness, before dashing to breakfast television studios
or taking leisurely breakfasts before the 2.30pm Commons sitting, clothes
emit hints of mood, sincerity, competence, dedication, determination and
affability. The boundless range of political characters turns Westminster
into a laboratory of fashion experimentalism.
Margaret Thatcher is a pacesetter in her stateswoman-like but,
oh-just-slightly, slinky suits. Together with her practical Marks and
Spencer shoes, her outfit is a cocktail of chemicals - powerful, moral,
respectful, ruthless and, to some fanatical admirers, sexual. Hers is the
uniform most mimicked by women MPs. She was always impeccably turned out as
prime minister.
Perhaps the image was too contrived. Virginia Bottomley, health secretary,
wears pastel shades - the 'Mumsie look,' miaows another female on the Tory
benches - and has a softer image. Her outfit says: 'The National Health
Service is safe in my hands.' But there are constraints. Tenderness has to
be combined with toughness if we are to be sure that she can stand up to the
brutal, mean-suited boys at the Treasury where tailoring is usually black or
very dark from the chancellor, Norman Lamont, downwards.
Bottomley dresses to care. Thatcher looks as if hiding a bent to kill, her
armoured glamour suppressing the human being inside. If there is one.
Employment secretary Gillian Shephard wears similarly aggressive outfits to
those of the former prime minister - sometimes in flamboyant yellow, like a
fiery Brimstone butterfly. She is a fighter, battling, sometimes
semi-publicly, over coal policy with Michael Heseltine, the epitome of
gentrified political ambition - down to the last groomed hair riding over
his double forehead to the collar of his tailored suit. Heseltine's clothes
are precise and calculated, shirts stiffened and reeking of purposefulness -
telling us, maybe, that his hopes of winning the prime ministership are not
yet thwarted.
The variety of butterflies and moths fluttering at Westminster, searching
for a collar or trinket - or frequently more - that will make them stand
out, is plentiful.
Spats and hats have gone but there are still waistcoats around, distant
echoes of parliamentary fashion when Winston Churchill was polishing his
sound bites, gold chain dangling from his waistcoat. 'I regard Parliament as
a formal occasion,' says Greg Knight, government whip, who wears his
slate-grey three-piece suit even in the height of summer. 'It is not a
branch meeting of the boilermakers' union. MPs should dress accordingly.'
A single item of clothing is enough to make a statement. Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, and Tristan Garel-Jones, Europe minister, wear green
Austrian Loden coats favoured by the continental bourgeoisie. At once, the
Foreign Office's image of dusty Victorian sensibility is draped in European
culture and idealism. Together they are formidable. 'I see you are wearing
your single European coat,' said John Major as they approached him once.
Labour may have been mistaken at the last election in using standardised
clothing guidelines to reinforce a particular image. The party wanted
respect and credibility; it needed to build trust with the electorate. But
the forced image backfired, a warning, perhaps, that to dress against the
grain of your character can be as bad as not worrying about dress at all.
Lack of sincerity and passion loses votes. More flair was in order.
The grey jacket of Dennis Skinner, the Labour MP for Bolsover, has chips
woven into the shoulders - but, no matter how unappealing his stubbornly
left-wing rhetoric, he scores high in sincerity rankings. So does Jeremy
Corbyn, Labour MP for north Islington, who wears sport jackets - often
without a tie - and baggy trousers. He shows off his working class
conscience by carrying papers in a plastic bag.
At the opposite extreme, Richard Ryder, the government's chief whip, is the
most pianissimo of statesmen. His suits are anonymous. His mannerisms gentle
as he prowls Westminster's corridors. Former prime minister Harold Macmillan
would put on his Grenadier guards tie when the government was in trouble.
Likewise, Ryder vents his feelings via bright blue, green and red ties. He
wears them like warning signs. Red tie at night, Euro-sceptics delight.
The boundary between individualism and eccentricity is narrow. 'We are not
pop stars. We are serious managers of the country,' says Ann Widdecombe,
social security minister, who wears smart-but-practical skirts to visit
benefit offices under construction. She would not be so presumptuous as to
cite examples. But Nicholas Fairbairn, Tory MP for Perth and Kinross, is
famous for his tartan trews - and little else. Eric Forth, education
minister, mixes glowing colour ties and handkerchiefs with classic
waistcoats but is in danger of undermining his credibility as a minister.
People talk about Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby. They talk
about his garish ties.
At Conservative Central Office, the advice of the communications experts is
that politicians should not dress in a way that distracts from what they are
saying. But there is a paradox. Too much effort in creating an image can be
misspent. 'Sharp changes are not advisable. The important thing is the
comfort of the person,' says one senior official. 'The way you dress is an
expression of how you see yourself.'
He is right. Kenneth Clarke could not be a teddy bear-like rogue of a home
secretary if he tightened his belt or swopped his Hush Puppies for shiny
black Lobbs. William Waldegrave, public services minister, could not keep up
his impression of 'Academic Tortured by the Febrility of Westminster' if his
trousers were pressed and the waistband not turned inside out. They are
making statements; what they are is more important than the way they dress.
So too is Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader and former marine, who
 -in spite of his action-man image - dresses from head to toe in Marks and
Spencer menswear. His dress sense says he wants off-the-peg respectability
without too much effort.
For John Smith, Labour's leader, there is no expression of anger or
reformist zeal in the sonorous, dark suits he buys from Slaters, the Glasgow
tailor favoured by lawyers. But there is a tad of ardour from the floral
ties chosen by his fashion student daughter. On the Tory backbenches, among
the sea of suits, there are chrysalids of youthful ambition waiting to break
out and steal the show.
Alan Duncan, suave MP for Rutland and Melton, says MPs 'need to show
authority and a little bit of wit'. He recommends a tailored suit (four
buttons per sleeve); silk ties (small motif), cotton shirts (double cuff,
not white) and good shoes (tassels permitted).
It sounds wizard advice. But he has yet to get a government job. A better
guide would, perhaps, be more general. Politicians need to dress according
to their personality but without being fastidious. Dress is both important
and not important: there are limits - the need to look respectable, to
inspire confidence - but the politician's character needs to shine through,
to shout for attention.
Yet, as if to prove there will always be exceptions, there is John Major. He
lacks even a smidgen of wit in his dress, and he avoids individualism. In
his accountants' suits and pale shirts, the prime minister would be lost on
a commuter train.
What is his message? Respect but ordinariness, a man of the people, perhaps.
He has made it to the top yet is still - not quite - seen as a natural
leader. In his dress, there is no aggression or dash.
He is the Cabbage Grey that sucks the best nectar.
