For the Dublin Theatre Festival the Rough Magic theatre company produced
Congreve's The Way of the World, which has not been seen here since 1932.
Perhaps the reason for its long absence is that this is not a light, frothy
comedy, but a serious moral one whose convoluted plot demands close
attention from the audience.
Director Lynne Parker has taken an inspired gamble by setting the play in
the 1930s, a period which is brilliantly suited to Congreve's cynical cast
of characters. It is played in the round on a set (by Blaithin Sheerin, who
also designed the costumes) which consists of a stark steel and smoked glass
cocktail bar. The women wear slinky long dresses while the men appear in
various permutations of white tie and evening dress.
However, it is still hard work to follow the double crossings and
dissimulations. Basically, it concerns Mirabell's efforts to convince Lady
Wishfort to allow him to marry her niece, Millamant. It is complicated by
the marital infidelities of the Fainalls, in which Mrs Marwood is involved,
and the arrival in town of Lady Wishfort's nephew Sir Wilful Witwoud. Most
people will sympathise with Sir Wilful's half-brother Witwoud when he says,
towards the end of the long protracted denouement, 'Egad I understand
nothing of the matter; I'm in a maze yet, like a dog in a dancing school.'
One of the most striking features of the 1930s setting is the uncanny way
that Congreve's words, written in 1700, sound so appropriate from the lips
of these chain-smoking lounge lizards. The characters' affected, world-weary
attitudes travel remarkably well across the centuries, and Congreve's words
are brought newly alive.
Among a hard-working cast of 13, Darragh Kelly's Witwoud is especially
appealing, raising laughs where one would not necessarily expect them.
Barbara Brennan plays the aged and domineering Lady Wishfort with such
subtlety that she seems more pathetic than ridiculous. Andrea Irvine's
Millamant is a lively black-haired beauty, and it is easy to see why
Mirabell is so enthralled. I thought that Peter Hanly's Mirabell was too
young and foppish to carry the moral weight of the part, but he came good in
the last act. Martin Murphy, a large fresh-faced man, was perfectly cast as
the country cousin, Sir Wilful Witwoud, and Mal Whyte apparently making his
stage debut as Waitwell, the servant who is disguised to woo Lady Wishfort
and make a fool of her, has a natural comic gift.
Lynne Parker directs the proceedings at a fast and well-sustained pace, and
as far as I could tell not a word has been cut. She also makes some good
visual jokes with the unusual set, for example, posing Millamant beside a
pillar to which the white lily has been tied, and using the actors'
cigarette smoke to symbolise their dissemblance.
