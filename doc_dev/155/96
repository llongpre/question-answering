Richard Beckman is still in graduate school at the University of New Mexico, 
but his untitled large-scale sculpture in concrete and steel has a calm 
strength and clean, unfussy presence that bodes well for the future. A majestic 
spiral of rusted steel contains a graduated set of triangles; another spiral of 
neatly riveted plywood looks like a giant Slinky; twin curved triangular pieces 
made of concrete and steel rock low to the floor in separate rhythms.

The biggest piece (nearly 5 feet tall) is a large-gauge steel-mesh cube 
suspended within a steel-mesh cylindrical enclosure. A sprinkling of small 
rocks inside the piece -- sure to set up a racket as they slip from one resting 
place to another -- suggest the cylinder has a kinetic function. This piece has 
a rough-and-ready look, like a project a guy tinkers with endlessly in the 
basement. Particularly after you see how elegant Beckman can be, its 
awkwardness is refreshing.

Carl H. Johansen also lives in New Mexico. Paintings from his "Black Mesa" 
series have the smart, knowing veneer that comes of slamming together bits and 
pieces of art history.

In "Fascist's Dream," a big pretty-boy head lolls on its side as if broken off 
from an insipid statue. Tiny glittered hearts rise to an image that could have 
been painted by Charles Sheeler: a long red wall scooting back into the 
distance under a harsh, raking light. A glimpse of an O'Keeffe-like black cross 
set in a yellow glow; a small, busy painting of heads and flowers in harsh 
mockery of Picasso's style and an insouciant strip of hot pink spritzed with 
glitter complete this dizzy tour through a debauched and deadened brain.

Bits of Navajo rug, Matisse nudes and Van Gogh peasants tromp through this 
series, but the overwhelming bogeyman to be exorcised here is late Picasso. His 
ghost wanders into a painting called "Love Like This," which is otherwise a 
more searching and quietly enigmatic affair. A twig of dried mullein looks like 
a sea monster, caged within the chalked yellow walls of a large rectangular 
space. Skinny, unravelled bits of carpet wander uncertainly. A painted pod-eyed 
monster with a sword does battle. And there's a pretty large untenanted area of 
black paint and flaked metal that gives these oddly evocative components room 
to breathe. (Natoli -- Ross Gallery, 2110 Broadway, to Aug. 5.) CATHY CURTIS
