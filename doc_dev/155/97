Great parties are not like trolley cars or men. If you miss a good one, another 
one is not likely to be by in a short time. 
</P>
<P>
So too bad if you missed the massive, maddeningly marvelous (and probably close 
to a million-dollar) bash Fred Hayman threw Saturday night. Always a 
perfectionist and a stylish showman, Hayman brought together 1,000 of his 
closest friends, a handful of California's best restaurants, took over an 
entire sound stage, added the sets from the film "Phantom of the Opera" in the 
entrance way and gave away a $25,000 door-prize-of-your-life vacation at Paris' 
Plaza Athenee. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a party you won't see twice," said a Chaneled Jane Nathanson, who 
should know because she hosted the multiacclaimed Armani party at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art last January. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so glad I'm here," said Jill Halverson, director of the Downtown Women's 
Center, to May Co. veep Jim Watterson, both of whom are active with Hayman on 
projects for the homeless, to which Hayman has contributed more than $1 million 
in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, let me spray you!" ordered Patti Skouras, one of the cabal of the 
cognoscenti who were the "fragrance panel" for Hayman's new scent, 273. The 
launching of the perfume, plus the renaming of his landmark Rodeo Drive store 
as "Fred Hayman Beverly Hills," was the purpose of the party. Brilliant yellow 
with a red signature appeared on balloons, tables, sweat shirts of the valet 
parkers and even the tulip centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
"This reminds me of Berkeley in the '60s," quipped investment counselor Jim 
Birdwell, making his way through the crowd with his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Chasen's?" said Barry Kaye to Jimmy's Peter Luda. Jimmy's, the Bistro, 
Bistro Garden, Spago, La Scala, the Grill and, of course, Chasen's had all 
provided their specialties, and their regulars patiently queued up, unmindful 
of black-tie and spangles. 
</P>
<P>
For one night only, Hayman, there with steady Betty Endo, had managed to 
transform a Universal sound stage into a little, diamond-crusted piece of 
Beverly Hills. And he assembled the most mixed-media guest list since the 
Olympics. Top party-goers were on hand -- Virginia and Gerald Oppenheimer 
chatting with Maude Chasen and Henry and Jayne Berger, Ellen and Bernie Byrens 
(she in a knockout Bill Blass) greeting Teddy Orgell, Richard and Geri 
Brawerman (in a spangled Bill Blass jacket copied from a Matisse) and Henry and 
Sedge Plitt. 
</P>
<P>
Glamour girls like Shirlee Fonda, Frances Bergen, Altovise Davis, Vanna White 
and Connie Selleca were there, along with Jackie and Sydney Rosenberg, designer 
Jack Lowrance, Doris Fields Heller with the Westwood Marquis' Jacques Camus, 
who is hosting Franco and Anne Marie Cozzo of the Plaza Athenee, who came from 
Paris just to present the door prize. 
</P>
<P>
And, for those into social fortunetelling, the drawing was a symbolic end to 
the Reagan era. Bernice Brown came up the winner of the UTA first-class air 
fare for two to Paris and a week in a suite at what Hayman described as "the 
most wonderful hotel in the world." As her husband, former Gov. Pat Brown, 
cheered, Bernice went on stage. "Oh my God," Hayman greeted her, with a look of 
happy surprise, then shook his head vigorously as she asked: "Do you want to 
take it back?" 
</P>
<P>
Other well-known Democrats were in attendance, like songwriters Marilyn and 
Alan Bergman (who, with Marvin Hamlisch, wrote a special song for the occasion, 
"We Go So Well Together"); Roz Wyman (with Republican John Berl) talking with 
Bob and Sally Burkett; Mickey Ziffren (in a slinky black dress) with her 
brother-in-law, Leo; Atty. Gen. John and Andrea Van de Kamp chatting with Marc 
Nathanson; Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and his wife, Judge Diane Wayne; State 
Comptroller Gray and Sharon Davis, and Lisa Specht and Ron Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Reagan, in pink, headed the list of well-known Republicans. (Earlier in 
the week, Hayman had sent Nancy Reagan the first bottle of 273, with a note 
welcoming her back to the neighborhood.) Mary and Brad Jones were there, as was 
Giney Milner with Jim Wharton. 
</P>
<P>
Publicist Wanda Henderson was there in a feathered hat and boa: "I molt at 
midnight, darling." Elaine Goldsmith was in a striking black and red gown, the 
one she, as a faithful board member, bought at the Otis/Parsons student fashion 
show last year. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown types were there: City Council president John and Margaret Ferraro 
chatted with attorney Neil Papiano and Sharon Thralls. Entertainment types: 
Ricardo and Georgiana Montalban and Columbia Television's Gary and Anne 
Lieberthal, Charlton and Lydia Heston, Henry and Ginny Mancini (after their 
successful Music Center party Friday night), and Alan Carr with Wendy Stark, as 
well as Burt Sugarman and Mary Hart. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the restaurant mavens: Jimmy and Anne Murphy (she in a purple 
ruffled gown "which Fred did"), the Bistro's Kurt Niklas and Ini Asman, lining 
up for some Spago food from Wolfgang Puck (perhaps the happiest man in 
attendance, because his glamorous wife, Barbara Lazeroff, expects their first 
baby in May). 
</P>
<P>
Political consultant Joe Cerrell, with the warm smile he gets at the approach 
of the USC Marching Band, asked cutely: "I want to know if anyone ever has seen 
the UCLA Marching Band?" Everyone at the party had a special connection to 
Hayman. Cerrell said that when Hayman was at the Beverly Hilton, he did all the 
Democratic political dinners: "He even did Lee's and my wedding on Nov. 17, 
1963. And he left the Hilton the next day." 
</P>
<P>
As the big band left the stage, as the jazz club was set up in a tent where the 
Beluga caviar and Chasen's chili were served as appetizers, before the 
dozen-plus "dirty dancers" did their routine, and the quartet of rock 'n' roll 
women singers took over the stage -- Fred Hayman thanked his friends "for a 
brilliant evening." 
</P>
<P>
This is, he said, "the American dream." And there was probably not a party-goer 
who would argue with that.
