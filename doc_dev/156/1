Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, aims to establish
itself as the leading software supplier for interactive broadband networks
that will provide interactive television and home PC services.
The company yesterday announced an 'end-to-end software solution' for
interactive TV, including distributed operating system software for
connecting television set-top boxes and personal computers with a wide
variety of services, plus media server software for delivering video on
demand and a set of interactive system applications.
The Microsoft software is to be tested in an interactive TV trial being
staged next year in Seattle, Washington, by Tele-Communications, the largest
US cable-TV operator.
Microsoft yesterday announced agreements with other network operators
including Deutsche Telekom, Telstra of Australia and US West Communications,
a regional US telephone company, which will also test the Microsoft
technology.
Previously, Rogers Cable-systems, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone and SBC
Communications also announced plans to use the Microsoft technology.
Hewlett-Packard, the second largest US computer company, and NEC of Japan,
are to develop set-top boxes that will be used to link TV sets to
interactive serv-ices using Microsoft software.
They join General Instrument, the leading maker of cable-TV converter boxes,
in supporting Microsoft technology.
NEC will also build 'media servers' for video on demand services. Intel and
Compaq Computer have previously announced their intention to build servers
compatible with the Microsoft software.
Several systems integrators including Alcatel, Andersen Consulting, Lockheed
Missiles &amp; Space, NTT Data Communications Systems and Olivetti have
committed to provide service and support for testing and global deployment
of the Microsoft technology,
'Microsoft is pleased to be working with a broad range of telecommunications
leaders as we complete the design of our system; together we can build a
basis for the evolving information society,' said Mr Craig Mundie,
vice-president of the advanced consumer technology division at Microsoft.
Microsoft said it would publish details of interfaces needed to make use of
its software, and offer the development tools necessary for other developers
to create services, applications and multimedia content for interactive TV.
'Our strategy is to develop a deployable system, where the engineering work
is complete, and then test it at every increasing scale in order to get it
to commercial operation,' said Ms Laura Jennings, senior director of the
advanced consumer technology division at Microsoft.
