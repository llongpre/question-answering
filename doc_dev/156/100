MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, reported a 20 per
cent increase in first-quarter revenues.
Net income for the quarter was in line with expectations at Dollars 239m or
79 cents a share, up from Dollars 209m or 70 cents in the same period last
year.
Revenues rose to Dollars 983m from Dollars 818m a year ago. Those from
software sold to computer manufacturers were particularly strong,
representing 26 per cent of the total, said Mr Mike Brown, Microsoft's
vice-president of finance and treasurer. For fiscal 1993, these OEM sales
represented 19 per cent of total revenues.
In the first quarter, sales of operating systems software accounted for 36
per cent of revenues, up from 32 per cent in the same period last year.
Applications programs sales were 59 per cent of revenues, down from 60 per
cent.
Microsoft said changing software buying patterns have lifted sales of its
suite of office software products.
Whereas individual stand-alone applications products once generated the bulk
of applications unit sales, the Microsoft Office, combining word processing,
spreadsheet, presentation graphics, database management and electronic mail
is its most popular applications product.
More than 2.5m units have shipped worldwide.
Earlier, Microsoft executives had warned analysts that the increase in sales
of suites of programs, together with the rise in OEM sales was expected to
slow revenue growth in the future.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, Microsoft's revenues rose 27 per cent,
while net profits were up 20 per cent.
During the quarter, Microsoft began shipping its most-advanced operating
system product, Microsoft Windows NT.
