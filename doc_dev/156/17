systems market has now become the main battleground for the new strand of
operating system development

Operating systems software occupies a pivotal position in modern computer
systems. Not only does the choice of operating system define the computer
hardware - it also defines the application.
The choice of operating systems platform has, in effect, replaced the choice
of hardware for users.
While in the past, there was always a danger that computer users could
become dependent upon their hardware supplier, over the last decade the
emphasis has shifted to the operating system platform supplier. This has
become increasingly confusing for users and software developers who are
looking for a stable platform on which to build applications.
The result has been a bitter public conflict among operating system
suppliers, each hoping to gain dominance in the market.
This conflict dates back to the mid-1980s when the virtues of common
operating environments were first recognised.
The success of IBM's Personal Computer (PC) along with Microsoft's MS/Dos
created a large, homogeneous software product market for the first time.
Previously, every computer came with its own operating environment - making
it impossible to move application software from one machine to another
without significant changes.
The MS/Dos PC changed this and allowed a new breed of mass market software
developers such as Lotus, Novell and Microsoft to dominate personal computer
software.
Towards the end of the 1980s, these and other software producers saw that
the same approach could be taken to build software for larger systems -
either in the form of PC networks or client-server systems.
The need emerged, therefore, for an operating environment which could
deliver the same advantages as a PC operating system, while coping with the
greater complexity of multi-user systems.
It is this emerging mid-range systems market which has become the main
battleground for the new strand of operating system development. There is no
shortage of contenders. Microsoft is in pole position with the extended
version of its successful Windows-MS/Dos operating system for the PC.
Known as Windows NT, it is claimed to be the natural migration path for
single PC users who want to move into multi-user networked systems.
Microsoft aimed to sell a million copies by the end of its first year and,
while this target has proved to be ambitious, Microsoft has managed to get
close to it. More significantly, sales of the original Windows are now about
50m worldwide and growing quickly. Microsoft's main rival comes from a
combination of Novell and other Microsoft competitors who back various
flavours of the Unix operating system originated by AT&amp;T's Bell laboratories
in the 1970s. Unix has the advantage of a long history of supporting
multiple users and wide backing across the industry.
Most hardware manufacturers offer a Unix platform - although they are not as
consistent as they should be in conforming to the standards. Unix has
managed to gain some success in the mid-range systems market and a good
portfolio of applications software now exists for it.
The other main rival to Windows NT is OS/2 - an operating system developed
originally by both Microsoft and IBM. When it was announced in 1987, it was
designed to replace MS/Dos. But after slow initial success, IBM and
Microsoft went their separate ways - leaving IBM to continue OS/2
development on its own. OS/2 has attracted a solid core of established large
IBM customers because it fits in well with their existing systems.
The OS/2 operating systems has an estimated four million users worldwide -
but has had little success outside the IBM market.
These three - Windows NT, Unix and OS/2 - are the main contenders in the
operating systems conflict and each faction has embarked on a campaign to
attract firstly, application software developers and, secondly, end-user
companies.
The conflict is further confused, however, by the emergence of a new strain
of object-oriented operating systems. Apple's Macintosh, for example, has
attracted attention - although it is limited by its ties to Apple's
hardware.
Apple founder Steve Jobs left to form Next Computer in the late 1980s,
creating yet another potential rival operating environment. Next has built a
version of its Nextstep object-oriented system for the PC and, again, has
scored some success in niche markets.
Another object-oriented environment has grown out of a joint venture between
Apple and IBM under the Taligent name. Taligent promises to improve
development productivity with its operating system - although it will be
some time before it its ready for the market.
The primary task of all of the contenders in the operating system battle is
to woo software package developers. MS/Dos was successful because Microsoft
was able to persuade a large number of application builders to base their
packages on it.
Software developers are sanguine about operating systems, however, and many
have accepted that, unlike the MS/Dos market, they will have to back several
different options.
'We have taken the view that the operating system is irrelevant to the
end-user and are working to hide it,' explains Mr Ketan Karia, director of
marketing at application software tool specialist Cognos UK.
'We aim to make our tools work across a range of operating systems but we
are concentrating on Unix and Windows NT at the moment.' Mr Derek Masters,
managing director of Sterling Software UK, comes at the problem from a
different angle. As a veteran software supplier to the IBM mainframe market,
Mr Masters says his company has been driven by customers moving from
mainframe-based systems to networked systems.
'Three years ago our customers were entirely mainframe based. Now they have
lots of Unix, Windows and OS/2 systems which they want attached to their
mainframes. We have had to change our products to cover the whole range.'
Sterling's products involve managing communications and data storage across
an enterprise and must, therefore, be capable of coping with any operating
environment which might be connected to the network.
'Microsoft is in a strong position with Windows NT - although we find our
traditional customers favour OS/2 because of its IBM background. Then again
we see Unix creeping in - especially in applications which use electronic
data interchange (EDI),' Mr Masters adds.
In theory, users should not have to worry about operating systems and, in
the long term, it seems likely that much of burden caused different
environments will be shouldered by tool builders.
Meanwhile, software developers and users will have to accept that they must
keep an eye on all of the main contenders - and maybe some of the
'also-rans.'
