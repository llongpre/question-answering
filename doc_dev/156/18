   International Business Machines Corp. and Novell Inc. will
announce tomorrow a marketing agreement that will further
strain IBM's relations with Microsoft Corp., industry
executives said.
   Those relations have come under scrutiny in recent weeks
as IBM and Microsoft -- whose partnership helped provide the
foundation for the personal-computer industry -- have
increasingly headed in different directions.

   The industry executives said IBM and Novell will announce
that the IBM sales force will resell Novell's Netware
operating system, which controls the flow of traffic on
personal-computer networks. IBM, Armonk, N.Y., declined to
comment. Novell, Provo, Utah, said officials were traveling
over the weekend and couldn't be reached.
   IBM already sells a competing operating system, called LAN
Server, which derives from Microsoft's LAN Manager, so any
shift by IBM customers toward Novell would mark a setback for
Microsoft.
   Microsoft, which dominates the market for personal
computer operating systems, has said it views the network
operating system market as the next great battleground.
Microsoft has talked about beefing up its development efforts
and distribution network to match Novell's -- Microsoft has
said there are more Novell Netware dealers in the U.S. than
there are 7-Elevens, making it easier to buy that operating
system than it is to buy a Slurpie.
   But Microsoft's LAN Manager -- together with such cousins
as IBM's LAN Server -- controlled just 10% of the world-wide
market for network operating systems last year, according to
International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass., a
market-research firm. Novell controlled 53%, IDC said. And to
overtake Novell, Microsoft needs to retain what support it
has among the hardware giants, with their huge sales forces.
   On speculation that Novell would soon announce marketing
agreements with IBM and Digital Equipment Corp., Novell stock
has jumped from $43 at the end of last month; it rose $1.625
Friday to $47.625, a 52-week high, in over-the-counter
trading. Microsoft stock, itself on a furious climb of late,
climbed $1 to $104 in over-the-counter trading. IBM increased
$1 to $129.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The remaining question is just how hard IBM salesmen will
push Netware. IBM will continue to sell the rival LAN Server,
and it remains the industry's biggest supporter of the OS/2
operating system, which provides the basis for LAN Server.
Still, IBM has become more pragmatic about its product
offerings, and customers seem to want Netware more than they
do Microsoft's offering.
   In addition, the industry executives noted that IBM has in
recent months announced a series of agreements with Metaphor
Computer Systems, Go Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. for
software that IBM in the past might have developed with
Microsoft. Microsoft, for its part, has begun emphasizing the
Windows system-software product that it developed on its own,
even though IBM has pushed it to promote OS/2, which IBM and
Microsoft developed together.
