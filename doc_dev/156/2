Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, aims to establish
itself as the leading software supplier for interactive broadband networks
that will provide interactive television and home PC services, writes Louise
Kehoe in San Francisco.
The company yesterday announced an 'end-to-end software solution' for
interactive TV, including distributed operating system software for
connecting television set-top boxes and personal computers with a wide
variety of services, plus media server software for delivering video on
demand and a set of interactive system applications.
The Microsoft software is to be tested in an interactive TV trial being
staged next year in Seattle, Washington, by Tele-Communications, the largest
US cable-TV operator.
Microsoft announced agreements with other network operators, including
Deutsche Telekom, Telstra of Australia and US West Communications, a
regional US telephone company, which will also test the Microsoft
technology.
Previously, Rogers Cable-systems, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone and SBC
Communications also announced plans to use the Microsoft technology.
