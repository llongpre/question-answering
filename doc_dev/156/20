<LEADPARA>  Microsoft Corp.'s evangelists for its Windows computer software opened a camp
meeting Monday for about 2,100 programmers, three times more than Microsoft
expected to show up for the conference.;    The software company even took out
a parade permit so conferees, led by a Dixieland band, could move easily
through downtown streets between conference sites Monday evening.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Windows 3.1 Professional Developers Conference opened on the 10th
anniversary of the debut of the IBM Personal Computer and its
Microsoft-developed operating system, MS-DOS.;    The relationship between
Microsoft and IBM has become hostile.;    Microsoft has staked its future on a
program called Windows, while IBM has pursued a computer operating system
called OS/2.;    Windows makes IBM-type computers easier to operate by giving
them a graphics-based operating system similar to that popularized by Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh. Windows works in conjunction with DOS.;   
Conference attendees ranged from owners of one- or two-person software firms
to software developers from large corporations.;    Their interest is "vital,"
said Steve Ballmer, senior vice president for systems software at Microsoft,
based in suburban Redmond. "That's the No. 1 asset Windows has. Four million
users and all these developers.";    IBM developed OS/2 with Microsoft as a
successor to MS-DOS. But Microsoft scored a hit with Windows and has all but
abandoned OS/2. It has sold more than 4 million copies since Windows Version
3.0 was introduced in May 1990 and expects to sell nearly 8 million this year,
Ballmer said.;    The conference is aimed at whipping up enthusiasm for
Windows and helping speed developers' work on programs that use a new version
of Windows, 3.1, due out before the end of the year.;    Thousands of
application programs have been written for Windows, and Microsoft has shipped
more than 70,000 kits used by developers to write more software, Ballmer
said.;    Version 3.1 will be a fine-tuning of Windows, he said. Microsoft
plans upgrades in coming years, including Windows NT -- for new technology --
a version for high-powered personal computers and work stations due out in
1992.;    Ballmer said Microsoft doesn't plan to modify any of its
applications programs to run on future versions of OS/2. Instead, he said,
Microsoft counts on IBM producing OS/2 so it runs programs written for
Windows.;    He told the audience he had heard IBM intends to have OS/2 do a
better job of running Windows applications than Windows does.;    "It tells us
that even IBM recognizes that if OS/2 is going to succeed, it's going to
succeed because it runs the applications that you're writing," he said.  </TEXT>
