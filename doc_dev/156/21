   Making a rare public forecast, Microsoft Corp. officials predicted Friday that industrywide sales of personal computers, which swelled 30% in the company's fiscal year ended June 30, 1987, will grow at a 26% clip this fiscal year. 

   The personal computer software company also said it doesn't expect the majority of personal computer users to buy its much-ballyhooed, new OS/2 operating system until 1990 or 1991. 

   According to Microsoft's best estimates, said Steven Ballmer, vice president, systems software, personal computer sales grew to 6.5 million units in fiscal 1987 from five million units the year earlier. 
Now Microsoft expects sales to reach 8.2 million units for fiscal 1988. 
Moreover, during fiscal 1988, Microsoft expects 55% of all International Business Machines Corp. personal computers and compatible machines sold to be high-performance models capable of running the new OS/2 operating system. 
In fiscal 1987, only 42% were the high-powered models. 

   Microsoft is in a unique position to track and estimate personal computer sales because it provides the operating system software for IBM's personal computers and compatible machines made by other companies, which together account for 90% of all personal computers sold. 
Microsoft officials, who in the past have kept such projections to themselves, made the predictions at a seminar held for reporters and analysts last week to outline progress in refining the long-awaited OS/2. 

   Despite Microsoft's hard numbers predicting heady growth through midyear, "the outlook for personal computer sales for all of calendar 1988 is still unclear . . . because a lot of that sales growth Microsoft is talking about is under our belts already," said David Readerman, a Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. analyst. 

   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Microsoft closed down $1.125 at $53.875 a share. 

   IBM and Microsoft, which together designed OS/2, began shipping to customers in December a version that didn't include the "presentation manager" feature that handles on-screen graphics. 
Without that feature, OS/2 is difficult to use, and applications programs -- word processors, financial spreadsheets and the like -- can't easily take advantage of fancy graphics or the system's ability to juggle several programs at once. 

   According to Mr. Ballmer, Microsoft will send out an early version of OS/2 with the presentation manager to independent software developers in March so they can begin fitting applications programs to it. 
IBM will ship the complete version to its customers in October, and other manufacturers of IBM-compatible machines will ship copies in early 1989, he said. 

   Mr. Ballmer cautioned that there won't be much reason to use OS/2 until software companies develop programs that tap its full power and special features. 
"I wish we could quiet down all this talk about buying OS/2 for its own sake and wait for the new applications," said Mr. Ballmer. 

   Those applications should arrive in a torrent late this year or early next year, according to William Lowe, the executive in charge of IBM's personal computer efforts. 
"We share (Microsoft Chairman William) Gates's goal of seeing 1,000 applications programs (tuned to OS/2) shipped by the end of 1988," Mr. Lowe told the seminar. 

   Even so, neither Mr. Lowe nor Mr. Gates believes OS/2 will catch on immediately in a big way, mainly because personal computer users will still get a lot of use out of programs that work with OS/2's precursor, MS-DOS. 
According to Mr. Gates's estimates, only about 15% of all new personal computers sold in 1989 will use OS/2, and it will be mid-1991 before 50% of all new machines will use OS/2.
