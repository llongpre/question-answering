In an effort to boost the development of a major new market for personal 
computer hardware and software, Microsoft Corp. and a number of PC 
manufacturers on Tuesday announced a set of basic standards for so-called 
multimedia computers. 
</P>
<P>
Multimedia combines traditional computing functions with high-quality sound and 
video, thus opening a broad new range of possible applications. Technological 
advances over the past several years have rendered multimedia practical on 
standard personal computers, and many companies have seized on multimedia in 
recent months as a key growth area. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement was an effort to establish a minimum set of criteria for 
multimedia personal computers, thus allowing software developers to write 
multimedia programs with a knowledge of what kind of hardware will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy Corp., parent company of the Radio Shack electronics chain, joined with 
nine other computer vendors in agreeing to ship a multimedia machine by next 
year. Such a system will include an IBM-compatible personal computer with 
either a 286 or 386 microprocessor from Intel Corp. that's equipped with at 
least 2 megabytes of memory, a 30-megabyte hard disk drive, VGA graphics, a 
digital audio system and a CD-ROM laser disk drive. In addition, the machines 
will include Microsoft's Windows operating software equipped with special 
multimedia extensions. 
</P>
<P>
A multimedia package would add about $1,000 to the cost of a typical business 
PC. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines, while not committing to specific hardware 
deliveries, is supporting the initiative in promoting the development of 
multimedia software for its OS/2 operating system. 
</P>
<P>
Among the computer vendors joining Tandy in supporting a multimedia platform 
are AT&amp;T, NEC, Fujitsu, Olivetti and Zenith. Tandy said it would promote 
multimedia through special promotions in its Radio Shack stores. 
</P>
<P>
While Tuesday's announcement should give a lift to multimedia development 
efforts, it did not resolve many of the thornier issues, such as exactly how 
full-motion video will be handled in future multimedia computers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, computer vendors whose machines are not IBM-compatible, such as 
Apple Computer and Next Inc., are pushing ahead with their own multimedia 
plans.
