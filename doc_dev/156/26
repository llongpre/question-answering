war - A look at preparations to challenge Microsoft's expansion

Novell, the US networking software company, is positioning itself for what
may become the computer software marketing battle of the decade, with its
planned acquisition of AT&amp;T's Unix Systems Laboratories.
Novell is on a collision course with Microsoft, reigning champion of the
software industry, in a fight to establish the dominant software system for
the next generation of networked computer systems.
Currently, Novell is the leading supplier of software that manages the
communications between computers linked on networks. Microsoft, however,
leads the market for personal computer operating systems.
The functions of operating systems and network management systems are,
however, beginning to overlap and the trend is expected to accelerate when
Microsoft next year launches 'Windows NT' a new version of its popular
personal computer operating system that incorporates network management
functions.
What is more, Microsoft has ambitions way beyond the desktop computer. Mr
Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, has made no secret of
the fact that with Windows NT he aims to address a broader segment of the
computer market, including classes of computers that run the Unix operating
system.
Thus Novell's acquisition of Unix represents a move to counter Microsoft's
anticipated attack. By putting its marketing muscle behind Unix, Novell aims
to accelerate the adoption of the AT&amp;T developed operating system and
reinforce its role as an 'industry standard'.
Yet with the acquisition of USL, Novell will also inherit a history of
feuding over Unix which began in the mid-1980s with AT&amp;T's unpopular steps
toward 'commercialising' the operating system through a partnership with Sun
Microsystems, the leading workstation manufacturer.
Rival industry groups backed different versions of Unix, amid suspicions
AT&amp;T was favouring Sun over other computer makers.
These battles led to the formation of USL, in 1991, as an independent
business unit that would develop Unix technology while providing all
licensees with equal access to development plans. This was underscored by
the acquisition of minority stakes in USL by several computer and software
companies.
Novell's acquisition of USL will, however, once more place Unix under the
control of a single company, potentially resurrecting the old 'Unix wars'.
'Since AT&amp;T will no longer own USL, this eliminates some of the old
prejudices that have kept Unix in two camps and can help lead to the
unification of Unix,' said Mr Willem Roelandts, Hewlett-Packard
vice-president and general manager of the computer systems.
HP was a founding member of the Open Software Foundation, an industry group
that emerged in opposition to AT&amp;T's control over Unix. HP already has 'an
excellent relationship' with Novell, Mr Roelandts said. The same is true of
several other open systems computer manufactures.
Unix International, an industry organisation formed to back AT&amp;T's version
of Unix, was also quick to pronounce its approval of the Novell acquisition.
'As part of Novell, USL has pledged its commitment to fair and neutral
access to Unix technology,' said Mr Peter Cunningham, UI president and chief
executive.
The willingness of Unix supporters to adopt Novell as their new champion and
put aside the in-fighting that has characterised the open-systems movement
over the past few years represents a strong endorsement of Novell. It also,
however, suggests a closing of ranks in anticipation of the battle between
Unix and Microsoft's Windows NT.
