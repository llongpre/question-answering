MICROSOFT, the US computer software group, is in talks with Time Warner, the
entertainment group, and Tele-Communications Inc, the big cable television
company, to set up a joint venture to develop interactive software for
television, according to news reports.
Although the three companies have not commented on the reports, their
negotiations are expected to lead to the establishment of a new company
producing software for cable television boxes.
The software would provide cable subscribers with access to a wide array of
interactive information and services. It would allow them to shop by
television, view individually-selected news and statistics, or select films
and video games from a vast electronic library.
The link-up between Microsoft, Time Warner and TCI would represent the
latest in a series of moves by large computer, entertainment and
communications companies joining forces to develop interactive media
technology for cable television users.
In April, Microsoft announced it was getting together with the micro-chip
manufacturer Intel and cable hardware company General Instrument to develop
a cable TV box with a built-in interactive personal computer.
