   IBM and Microsoft Corp. say their relationship
has never been better as they sought to quiet talk that a rift was
developing between the computer hardware and software giants.
   Millions of personal computer users worldwide use machines
designed to IBM and Microsoft standards.
   ``IBM today reaffirmed its relatioship with Microsoft,'' the
computer company said Monday.
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said in a separate statement:
``Microsoft and IBM have played a key role in the development of
the PC industry and we will continue to cooperate to provide the
best operating system solutions to our customers.''
   Talk that IBM and Microsoft were at odds has peppered trade
journals in recent weeks.
   In an interview, Steve Ballmer, a Microsoft vice president,
disputed reports that the two companies had stopped working
together on new versions of operating systems, the base layer of
software that controls a computer's internal functions.
   But the companies announced they would divide responsibility for
developing new versions of two operating systems: OS-2, used on
IBM's Personal System-2 computers, and DOS, the operating system
for IBM's older personal computers and many brands of
IBM-compatible machines.
   Previously, each company worked separately on developing new
versions of OS-2 and DOS. Under the new arrangement, IBM will have
primary responsibility for developing OS-2, while Microsoft will
have the primary role in improving DOS. William Bluestein, an
analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., interpreted
that as an admission the two companies had gone separate ways.
   ``It basically is a form of divorce,'' he said. ``What really is
being fought over is who controls the industry, who controls the
direction.''
   By controling the development of operating systems and the
timing of their release, Microsoft could influence sales of IBM
computers, while IBM could affect sales of the applications
software Microsoft makes, analysts say.
   But Aaron Goldberg, an analyst at International Data Corp., said
he believed the explanation by IBM and Microsoft that they only
wanted to improve the development process for operating systems.
   ``They have agreed to split the load a little better,'' he said.
``Microsoft doesn't have all the resources to chase every product.
   ``This to me is a perfect case in where our comptuer industry
trade press is trying to find a fire where there is no smoke,'' he
added.
   As part of the new arrangement, Microsoft will have the main
responsibility for developing a version of OS-2 for computers whose
central processor uses a technology called reduced-instruction-set
computing, or RISC, which primarily is used in powerful desktop
workstations. Bluestein called that a bone IBM threw Microsoft.
   OS-2 was jointly announced by IBM and Microsoft in 1987 as their
answer to the ease-of-use of Apple Computer Inc.'s popular
Macintosh.
   But the operating system has been slow to catch on, in part
because it can't be used with applications software, such as
spreadsheets, designed for DOS. It also is limited because it must
be used on machines that have a certain memory capacity - more than
many older computers have.
   Additionally, Microsoft has been heavily promoting a software
product called Windows that provides much of the Macintosh's
features on a DOS-equipped machine.
   IBM also said Monday that it would license the Windows software
from Microsoft, however IBM did not say whether it would provide
the feature with their machines.
   Last fall, to dispel similar rumors of a rift, IBM and Microsoft
jointly announced their strategy for OS-2 and Windows. They said
Windows was aimed at less-powerful computers using DOS, and OS-2
was designed for machines with greater memory.
   But IBM has said it is developing a version of OS-2 for older
computers that have less memory.
   That decision caused some industry-watchers to question its
support of Windows. Analysts also say Windows poses a threat to
OS-2, since it gies owners of older machines less incentive to
upgrade to models that could use OS-2.
