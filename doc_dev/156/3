The widely-reported collaboration between Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company, and Sega, the Japanese video game manufacturer,
now appears unlikely to create a significant role for Microsoft in video
game software.
A senior Sega USA official said that Microsoft, contrary to earlier reports,
was not developing an operating system for Saturn, the next-generation Sega
video game machine. Such reports led many industry observers to conclude
that Microsoft aimed to establish worldwide software standards in the video
game arena, just as it has in personal computer software.
However, Mr Steven Payne, director of marketing for Sega USA, the US
subsidiary of Sega responsible for the project, said that the software being
developed with Microsoft for Saturn, a high-performance video game system
under development by Sega, is not expected to include a 'fully-fledged
operating system'.
Microsoft officials said that they were precluded from discussing the
company's relationship with Sega by a non- disclosure agreement. However,
they played down the strategic significance of the relationship, noting that
Microsoft has focused and will continue to focus primarily on PC software.
'Our relationship with Microsoft is evolving and it would be premature to
say exactly what it will involve,' said Mr Payne. However, he noted that
current generation video game machines do not have an operating system;
instead, video game software developers write code that directly addresses
the microprocessor in a video game machine.
Saturn, an advanced video game machine under development by Sega, is
expected to incorporate a CD-ROM drive as well as the familiar game
cartridges. Microsoft's involvement is understood to involve a software
interface to the CD-ROM drive.
