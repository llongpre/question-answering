<LEADPARA>  IBM and Microsoft Corp. apparently have reached a truce in their bitter verbal
battle over the next generation of personal computer operating system
software.;   International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft parted ways
earlier this year over operating system software, which controls a personal
computer's internal functions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Since then, the two have engaged in a war of words, jabbing at each other's
company and products at news conferences and other public forums.;   But at
the huge Comdex computer show, which concluded Friday, the sparring between
the two giants of the industry was notably absent.;   IBM spokesman Kevin
Clark confirmed the change.;   "We are attempting to take the high ground in
terms of tone at this stage of the game. It turns out that both parties have
recently adopted that, and we're very pleased," Clark said.;   Added Microsoft
spokesman Marty Taucher: "We're trying not to be confrontational.";  
Microsoft makes DOS, the operating system used on the majority of personal
computers. But it is building its future on Windows, a program that gives IBM
PCs and clones many of the ease-of-use features of Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintosh.;   IBM, meanwhile, is promoting OS/2, an operating system it
originally developed with Microsoft as the eventual replacement for DOS.;  
The two companies ended their OS/2 cooperation early this year. Since then,
each has gone out of its way to point out shortfalls in the other's product --
both even publicly demonstrated how easy it is to "crash" the other's program
or cause it to malfunction.;   In an internal memo leaked to the media,
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates criticized IBM, saying the computer giant
delivered poorly done computer code for OS/2 while the two were still
cooperating.;   Though IBM and Microsoft heavily promoted their operating
systems on the Comdex showroom floors and in speeches, executives of the two
companies did not bash each other verbally this past week as they have in the
past.;   More significant, top public relations agents for the two companies
were seen holding a meeting that one industry executive, speaking anonymously,
described as a truce session.  </TEXT>
