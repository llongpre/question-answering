   Microsoft Corp. said 26 more computer equipment makers have agreed to license its latest operating system software for so-called local-area networks. 

   The new licensees, which include American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., Ungermann-Bass Inc. and Tandy Corp., join six other companies that previously agreed to license the software, including International Business Machines Corp., and bring the total number of licensees to 32. 
Local-area networks, or LANs, allow desktop-computer users to share information electronically. 

   Microsoft's quest to license its new LAN software, code-named OS/2 LAN Manager, is integral to the product's success because Microsoft manufactures no hardware itself, relying on its licensing agreements with equipment makers to boost sales. 

   Microsoft is best known as the publisher of the MS-DOS operating system for personal computers, the standard program that controls the flow of data in IBM-made PCs and compatible machines.
