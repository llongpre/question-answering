   Compaq Computer Corp. said it will offer Microsoft Corp.'s OS/2 operating system and has shipped kits to assist software developers writing programs for the system. 

   The Houston-based computer maker, as expected, made the announcements as part of an effort to dispel apparent confusion that the Microsoft operating system due early next year might not work with Compaq computers. 
The operating system is software that directs some of a computer's basic operations. 

   The OS/2 system, scheduled for release in the 1988 first quarter, was announced April 2, the same day International Business Machines Corp. unveiled its Personal System/2 computer line. 
There has been some confusion in the personal computer industry that OS/2 would run only on PS/2 models. 

   At a news conference here, Compaq reiterated that the new operating system will run on its computers. 
Compaq said it would offer a version of OS/2, tailored slightly to its computers' specifications. 
Compaq said it sent more than 300 kits to software developers to help them write software to take advantage of certain features Compaq offers. 

   Rod Canion, Compaq president, said OS/2 will run better on Compaq computers than on IBM's new line "because of the higher performance of our PCs." 
IBM maintains the operating system will run faster and with improved graphics on its models.
