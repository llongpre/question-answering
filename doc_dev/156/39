   Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are scheduled to unveil Monday a long-awaited software package known as OS/2 Presentation Manager. 

   The new program, slated for introduction at a New York news conference, represents the two companies' response to Apple Computer Inc., which has been capturing market share from IBM and the so-called clone makers in the lucrative desktop-computer arena for business users. 

   Industry experts expect Presentation Manager to imitate many of the graphics features popularized in Apple's Macintosh computers, features that make the computers easier to operate for lay users. 

   Microsoft, the software giant, is the publisher of Presentation Manager, as well as the earlier operating system software known as MS-DOS. 
An operating system acts as traffic cop for data inside desktop computers. 

   Separately, Microsoft introduced yesterday the newest version of its popular word-processing software, called Word. 
The new version, Word 5.0, is designed to run on the latest IBM-compatible operating system, called OS/2.
