   Microsoft Corp. said it will begin selling in June a library of 10 reference works stored on a single compact optical disk similar to those used for high-fidelity sound recordings. 

   Called the Bookshelf, the information source is Microsoft's first general-purpose product using compact disks as a data storage medium for personal computers. 
It also marks Microsoft's effort to establish a software standard for other software companies and publishers of encyclopedias, dictionaries and other reference works to follow in bringing more compact disk-based information to the personal computer market. 

   The Bookshelf, to be priced at $295, will include the entire American Heritage Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, the 1987 World Almanac, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, a U.S. zip code directory and several other reference works for writers. 

   Microsoft also will include a program necessary for a personal computer equipped with a compact disk read-only memory, or CD-ROM drive, to search the disk. 
The program, if successful, would become a standard for using CD-ROM-based data, much as Microsoft's operating system software is now the standard for International Business Machines Corp. personal computers and the legions of compatibles. 

   "Part of Bookshelf's appeal is that it will work with any of 14 word-processing programs" on IBM or compatible personal computers, said Thomas Lopez, vice president of Microsoft's compact disk division. 
According to Mr. Lopez, computer users will be able to retrieve text data from the compact disk and insert it directly into documents being prepared with a word-processing program. 

   Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge, Mass., a rival maker of personal computer software, already has begun selling its first compact disk product. 
Called One Source, it consists of financial information on a disk that is updated weekly, unlike the more long-lived information on Microsoft's disks. 
Depending on the number of data-bases that a customer wants, Lotus charges from $11,000 to $27,000 a year. 
Information from a One Source disk can be loaded from a compact disk player into a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet on a personal computer. 

   Several manufacturers make CD-ROM drives, but only recently have they become widely available, at a cost of $750 and up. 
Microsoft said the Amdek Corp. unit of Wyse Technology, San Jose, Calif., agreed to include a copy of Bookshelf with its Laserdrive I CD-ROM drive for $1,099. 
The drives, which are very similar to compact disk audio players, use a tiny laser to read data encoded in microscopic pits etched inside a spinning plastic disk. 
Bookshelf disks contain only text material, but eventually the optical disks will contain text, video, photos and sound on the same platter. 

   "It sure will make plagiarizing that much easier," said David B. Readerman, a securities analyst who follows Microsoft for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York, referring to the vast amounts of literature that CD-ROM technology could place at students' fingertips. 
"Clearly Microsoft knows the importance of setting software standards for a new storage medium. 
If you can be out there with what essentially becomes an industry standard, you can establish a golden franchise, as Microsoft itself did with its DOS operating system for IBM personal computers." 

   "We're trying to demonstrate a very practical use of a technology that we think will appeal to a broad cross-section of personal computer users," said Microsoft's Mr. Lopez. 

   Mr. Lopez said the company didn't know how many copies of Bookshelf it would sell this year, mainly because "this is a chicken and egg process. 
You have to have the drives out there to sell the software and you have to have the software to sell drives." 

   "I don't think they'll show any profits from this for a few years," said Rick Sherlund, a software industry analyst for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. "Microsoft is just trying to get the industry off on the right foot," Mr. Sherlund said. 

   In the six months ended Dec. 31, Microsoft had profit of $35.5 million, or $1.28 a share, on revenue of $147.8 million.
