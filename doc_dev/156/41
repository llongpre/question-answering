FT  23 AUG 93 / Peering through Microsoft windows: Probe by the Justice
Department may distract computer software giant

THE US Justice Department's decision to pursue an anti-trust investigation
of Microsoft makes it increasingly likely that the world's largest computer
software company will face charges of illegal anti-competitive business
practices.
Justice officials disclosed on Friday they had initiated an inquiry after a
preliminary review of evidence gathered by the Federal Trade Commission in
its three-year anti-trust probe of the company.
Simultaneously, the FTC said it had voted to close its investigation of
Microsoft after deadlocking - in February and again in July - on whether to
take action against the company. Mr Donald Clark, FTC secretary, warned the
company that the commission's decision should 'not to be construed as a
determination that a violation may not have occurred'.
'The Justice Department's involvement represents a much more serious threat
to Microsoft than it faced from the FTC,' said Wendy Goldman Rohm, author of
a book soon to be published on Microsoft's anti-trust battle.
The FTC had narrowed its case against Microsoft to issues unlikely to have a
significant financial pact on the company. But the Justice Department is
expected to broaden the case, raising the possibility of tougher sanctions
and even, perhaps, an order to break up the company. Microsoft has denied
any wrongdoing and insists it will be vindicated.
But the case raises serious concerns for the Clinton administration, which
has identified high-tech industries as the 'engine for economic growth'.
Microsoft is a prime example of the enterprise the administration aims to
encourage: a world market leader that has demonstrated US competitiveness.
The company recently reported its 18th consecutive year of growth in
revenues and profits. Over the past five years Microsoft's sales have grown
by an average 46 per cent a year to reach Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.48bn) in
fiscal 1993, ending June 30.
Microsoft dominates the market for personal computer operating systems,
programs that control the basic functions of a PC. Microsoft's MS-DOS is
used on more than 90 per cent of PCs. Microsoft's 'Windows' program, which
provides 'point and click' control for PCs, is also a runaway success with
over 30m copies in use.
Competitors claim Microsoft's success has come at their expense, alleging
the company abuses its dominant role in the PC operating system software
market to exclude or disadvantage competitors.
But a recent study suggests Microsoft has been the driving force behind
software industry growth. The study, by Telecommunications Research Group,
concludes almost 500 companies have been formed in the US to create PC
software to work with Microsoft's Windows, with more than 17,300 jobs
created. Microsoft Windows has created an industry of new companies that
together have annual revenues of about Dollars 280m, and more than Dollars
1.3bn in incremental revenues for established software firms, the study
concludes.
Yet the vast majority of these companies are very small. The typical
software firm employs just six people and generates about Dollars 560,000 in
annual revenues, according to TRG. All are beholden to Microsoft, reknowned
as an aggressive competitor.
Microsoft's role in the industry is frequently compared to the power that
IBM wielded in the computer market of the 1970s and early 1980s. Just as in
its heyday IBM set industry standards, dominated markets and instilled
'fear, uncertainty and doubt' into competitors, so today Microsoft can call
the shots in the PC industry.
Ironically, such comparisons have taken on a new dimension. Just as IBM
battled through 13 years of Justice Department anti-trust investigation,
from 1969 to 1982, so 'Big Green', as Microsoft is nicknamed in the computer
industry, now faces similar scrutiny.
Although the Justice Department ultimately dropped its anti-trust case
against IBM, the investigation had a serious impact which many analysts
believe contributed to its inability to keep pace with changes in the market
and to its current problems.
The government collected 760m documents from IBM during its 13-year
anti-trust investigation. 'IBM's top executives were afraid to put anything
down on paper for fear the government would subpoena the document. Lawyers,
who were developing a stranglehold on the business, decided what could be
said at meetings,' says Mr Paul Carroll in Big Blues, The Unmaking of IBM,
to be published next month.
Microsoft faces a period of intense scrutiny that seems certain to consume
the attention of its senior management. The anti-trust investigation could
prove to be a serious distraction for a company renowned for its tight
focus.
Nothing would please Microsoft's competitors more.
'I've developed a view that being successful is not a fun thing sometimes,'
Mr Bill Gates, chairman and chief executive, said recently. 'There is just a
phenomenon where people don't like a company as successful as ours.'
