   SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge set a June 13 hearing to
consider allowing Apple Computer Inc. the right to bring new
charges in its copyright infringement suit against Microsoft
Corp.
   At issue is the validity of a November 1985 agreement in
which Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., licensed to Redmond,
Wash.-based Microsoft certain aspects of its popular
Macintosh operating system. Apple has proposed to federal
Judge Vaughn Walker that it be allowed to amend its suit
against Microsoft to include charges that Microsoft breached
the 1985 agreement when it subsequently developed operating
systems with visual displays that increasingly resembled the
Macintosh. If proven, the charge would be grounds for
canceling the agreement, Apple contends.

   The 1985 agreement is at the core of Microsoft's defense
against Apple's copyright infringement charges, and its
cancellation could prove disastrous to Microsoft. But a
spokesman for the software giant asserted that the
enforceability of the agreement has already been established
in rulings by Judge Walker.
   "There are no material facts in these allegations that
have not come up before," said William Neukom, Microsoft vice
president for law. "Like Yogi Berra said, this is deja vu all
over again."
   At the hearing, Judge Walker is also to consider a motion
by Hewlett-Packard Co. to reconsider a March ruling in which
he found that Apple's screen displays were original works, an
important test of copyright validity, and that Apple had
adequately disclosed pre-existing programs when it initially
registered the works with federal copyright authorities.
Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is a
co-defendant in the case because of a license agreement it
had with Microsoft.
