THE US Federal Trade Commission yesterday delayed a decision on what action,
if any, to take against Microsoft, the world's largest computer software
company, following a two-and-a-half year anti-trust investigation.
The stock market reacted positively to the news that the FTC had failed to
decide on how to proceed with the anti-trust case. Microsoft's share price
jumped to close at Dollars 89 for a net gain of Dollars 4 1/4 on the day.
The commission will reconvene 'in the near future' to continue its
deliberations over the case.
The outcome of the anti-trust probe has been closely watched because it
could have a broad impact throughout the computer industry. Microsoft is the
premier supplier of software for use on personal computers.
The delay, announced after a four-hour meeting of the commission in a
statement that referred to 'a non-public matter' and did not name Microsoft,
may suggest Microsoft is attempting to fend off any FTC action against the
company.
Microsoft has denied any wrongdoing and said yesterday that it is
'continuing to co-operate fully with the non-public FTC investigation. Mr
Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, is said to have met with
FTC officials earlier this week.
However, investigators from the FTC's Bureau of Competition are believed to
have recommended that the commission seek court injunctions against
Microsoft to halt allegedly unfair practices.
According to Microsoft competitors, many of whom have provided information
to the FTC, these practices include the way the company sells and prices its
personal computer operating system, MS-DOS. Microsoft offers discounts to PC
manufacturers who agree to pay Microsoft a royalty fee for every PC they
sell, whether or not the buyer chooses to use the program.
Since MS-DOS is the standard PC operating system it is used by the vast
majority of PC buyers. However, companies that offer alternative programs
argue that they do not have an opportunity to compete.
Another issue said to have been investigated by the FTC involves the alleged
'tying' of sales of applications programs to those of operating systems in
which Microsoft holds a virtual monopoly.
Microsoft competitors have also expressed concerns to FTC investigators
about the company's alleged practice of favouring its own applications
programs developers by giving them early access to new versions of operating
system software, thus putting competitors at a disadvantage.
While the FTC could in theory file anti-trust charges against Microsoft
demanding that the company be broken apart, this is not expected. There is
also a possibility that the FTC could decide that no action should be taken
against the company .
According to industry analysts, however, a middle course is more likely. The
FTC might, for example, seek a court order prohibiting Microsoft's operating
system and applications divisions from sharing information. Or the company
might be ordered to halt its current operating system licensing practices.
Any such action would not have a significant impact upon Microsoft's sales,
industry analysts said.
To limit the effects of the FTC's decision, Microsoft could circumvent a
potentially lengthy trial by entering a consent degree, agreeing to the
FTC's demands. Mr Gates is said to favour bringing the matter to a close as
quickly as possible.
The 'non-public' anti-trust investigation has been common knowledge in the
computer industry since soon after it began and the potential for some form
of punitive action against Microsoft has cast a cloud over the company's
otherwise bright future.
For fiscal 1992, to end-June, Microsoft earned Dollars 708m , up 53 per cent
from the previous year, on revenues of Dollars 2.76bn, a 50 per cent
increase.
