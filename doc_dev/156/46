   Remember the fight between the rival VHS and Beta
videotape standards? The Battle over PC software standards is
similar, with the same high stakes for manufacturers and
users. But the PC battle has extra layers of complexity.
Here's a map of the action:
   Most PCs fall into two groups -- the IBM camp and the
Apple Macintosh. In general, the world of PC software today
can be divided into products written for the Macintosh and
for IBM PCs and their clones.

   The original IBMs were controlled by an operating system
called DOS, made by Microsoft. Four years ago, IBM and
Microsoft jointly developed a new operating system, OS/2,
which was designed to make IBM machines more powerful and
easier to use. In particular, it made IBM machines look a lot
like the famously easy-to-use Macintosh. Instead of typing in
strange commands, users could move a mouse device along a
menu of options sometimes depicted by symbols. A file folder
might represent a file, for example, and so forth.
   Last year, the battle took a twist, when Microsoft came
out with a new version of a program called Windows. Windows
turned out to be a good shortcut for DOS users who wanted
that famous Macintosh look. Instead of replacing DOS with
OS/2, they could get very similar results for a lot less
money by keeping DOS and adding Windows. That inflamed the
standards battle and made it look as if Microsoft were
diverting revenues for its IBM Os/2 partnership towards the
company's own coffers.
   Most people still use old-fashioned DOS alone, but the
battle for the next generation of PCs today has three camps:
Macintosh, IBM with OS/2, and IBM with DOS and Windows. All
three look increasingly alike -- a resemblance that is the
subject of Apple's lawsuit against Microsoft. For now, all
three camps make money for different companies and require
different designs for software makers.
