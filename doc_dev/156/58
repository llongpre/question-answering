FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (16): Tiger leaps
into video-on-demand business - Canada is aiming for a new national
'information delivery infrastructure'

The quest for diversification faced by many of the world's largest
telecommunications organisations is well under way in Canada - where the
roles of governments, as well as the existing near-monopoly of a few large
telecommunications and cable television providers are changing.
On the cable television front, some of the country's leading cable
television providers (the largest of which has diversified into the
provision of long-distance telephone services) were given a boost last week
by the announcement from the Canadian Radio-Television and
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) that it would grant approval for seven
new English language and two new French language speciality television
channels for marketing next year.
The move follows months of hearings by the CRTC of some 48 applications for
the provision of services - and the announcement by the country's leading
telephone companies that they wanted to get into the entertainment business
via the planned 'information highway'.
A survey which was conducted by one of the country's leading polling
organisations - the Toronto-based Decima Research - over the time period
when the hearings were under way - found that 72 per cent of the respondents
believed that Canada's competitiveness in the next five to 10 years would
depend on the country's ability to provide a 'sophisticated information
delivery infrastructure'.
Respondents to the Decima poll were reported to have seen key roles for
federal and provincial governments, industry, and academia in developing
information infrastructure.
The poll also apparently showed the need for co-operation among those four
big groups with findings that 92 per cent of respondents believed
technological changes now taking place would fundamentally alter the way
people did business in the future.
Furthermore, 74 per cent felt Canadian society would see more changes in the
next two years than in the last 10; 60 per cent believed technology had
improved the quality of life for the average Canadian.
The poll also showed that 85 per cent agreed that most businesses and
governments had not yet fully realised the economic potential of the
information highway.
It is perhaps with these results in mind that in April the Stentor group (a
consortium of the country's largest telephone companies) revealed plans for
a broadband information highway that, it estimated, would require some
CDollars 10bn of new investment and would create 12,000 jobs.
The group predicted that between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of Canadian
businesses and homes would have access to these new services by the year
2005 under what it called the 'Beacon Initiative'.
The plan calls for the establishment of high-tech wonders - such as
'virtual' courtrooms, virtual classrooms, remote diagnoses by doctors and
'video-on-demand' movies.
Stentor appears willing to put its money where its mouth is in making this
investment, however, with announced plans to spend some CDollars 500m on
network enhancements, the creation of a new company to supply multimedia
software to the establishment of a venture capital fund to assist small
companies that want to create produces for use on the 'highway'.
Rogers Communications, the country's largest cable television provider, is
fighting back and recently announced plans for consumer trials of a new home
video delivery technology developed in the US by Microsoft, the computer
software giant, and TCI, the US cable television firm.
The Microsoft/TCI venture (which has been code-named 'Tiger') marks the
first of many much-publicised moves into the fast-growing 'video on demand'
business.
Microsoft says that it will provide a fully scalable media file-server
solution that can be used from desktop computers right up to the citywide
deployment of cable television images.
Computer companies Compaq and Intel have also demonstrated the first
continuous-media server hardware based on this Tiger technology.
The idea behind it is that it should provide a lower-cost way of delivering
video-on-demand by using standard personal components and asynchronous mode
transfer (ATM) switches as part of the delivery mechanism - bringing down
the cost of entry into this pioneering market.
Microsoft says that it will allow thousands of users to gain 'split- second'
access to thousands of media files (such as movies, music videos or TV
shows) and allow laserdisc quality control of them - including the ability
to pause, reverse, fast-forward and jump ahead to specific parts of the
media file being currently played.
Mr Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's senior vice president, advanced technology,
says he hopes this move will start to dispel the notion that only very
high-end, expensive systems can be used to deliver video-on-demand.
'Some people assume that video-on-demand is a hardware problem for massively
parallel machines, but it's really a software issue,' he says.
'Once you have the right software, you can implement it in many ways - on
personal 'Tigers' for individual or workgroup use, corporate 'Tigers' for
small or mid-sized private networks or city 'Tigers' for large-scale,
metropolitan service areas.'
Tiger is based on Microsoft's existing Windows NT Advanced Server software
and will be tested in Seattle by employees of both Microsoft and US cable
television giant TCI as part of a pilot project this year - with more
widescale testing in Canada, Seattle and Denver in 1995.
The data from these tests will partly determine the eventual release date
for any products based on Tiger.
Microsoft is betting that Tiger will appeal strongly to cable television,
telephone, utility and private network companies and will be used to deliver
services such as telecommuting, video messaging, information navigation,
corporate multimedia servers, television post-production work, shopping
kiosk production and business transaction processing.
