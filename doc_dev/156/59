THE US Federal Trade Commission is scheduled to convene on Wednesday to
consider the results of a near three-year anti-trust investigation of
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company.
Investigators from the FTC's bureau of competition are believed to have
recommended that the commission seek a federal court injunction against
Microsoft. They allege that the company has improperly used its monopoly
position in the market for PC operating system software to disadvantage
competitors.
Throughout the investigation, Microsoft has denied any wrongdoing, insisting
that it is 'co-operating fully with the FTC investigation'.
In February, the commission's attempts to make a recommendation reached
deadlock, with two commissioners voting in favour of taking action against
Microsoft, and two voting against. A fifth commissioner, claiming a conflict
of interest, excused himself from the case.
At this week's meeting, the commission will be presented with a much
simplified and narrowed case against Microsoft, according to Ms Wendy
Goldman Rohm, author of a soon-to-be published book called The FTC versus
Microsoft: The inside story.
The revised case focuses on allegations of 'technological tying' of
Microsoft's widely used Windows program to its MS-Dos PC operating system,
according to Ms Goldman Rohm.
Microsoft has been accused by competitors of attempting to raise false
concerns among customers that its Windows program does not work properly
with operating system programs sold by competitors. There are also
complaints that it has linked product warranties to the use of its MS-Dos
operating system.
If the commission reaches deadlock again on the Microsoft case, the US
Justice Department, which also has jurisdiction over anti-trust enforcement,
may take up the matter, Ms Goldman Rohm says. 'There is considerable
political pressure being brought on the commissioners not to just drop the
case.'
Yet even if the revised case against Microsoft is pursued by the FTC, the
outcome could be 'commercially insignificant', Ms Goldman Rohm predicts.
She says the FTC is unlikely to seek 'structural remedies', such as breaking
up Microsoft into two separate companies. Instead, the Commission may simply
issue a 'cease and desist' order against the company.
