   Microsoft Corp. said 3Com Corp. agreed to help develop and market its new software for personal computers linked into networks. 

   The pact is considered an effort to establish industry software standards for tying together networks of personal computers using Microsoft's operating system software. 

   Microsoft said 3Com will help develop further features for the Microsoft OS/2 LAN Manager software as well as sell it through its dealers. 3Com, based in Santa Clara, Calif., makes equipment, including personal computers, for use in the networks, which enable users to share common data and programs. 

   Microsoft, in conjunction with International Business Machines Corp., is developing OS/2, an operating system for IBM's newest generation of personal computers. 
OS/2 is scheduled to be available to computer users sometime in 1988. 

   Separately, 3Com reported that profit for the fourth quarter ended May 31 rose 50% to $3.2 million, or 20 cents a share, from $2.1 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 63% to $31.6 million from $19.3 million. 

   For the year, net income was $11.1 million, or 76 cents a share, up 66% from $6.7 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 72% to $110.4 million from $64 million. 
Per-share net income reflects 12% more shares outstanding for the quarter and 5% for the year. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, 3Com closed at $19 a share, down 87.5 cents.
