EC competition authorities are investigating allegations of antitrust
violations against Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company.
According to Microsoft, the EC investigation stems from a complaint filed on
June 30 by Novell, the leading computer networking software company and
Microsoft's arch-rival.
The allegations follow abortive secret merger talks between the two
companies last year.
The Directorate General for Competition (DG4) is currently 'assessing the
merits of Novell's allegations', Microsoft said. 'We believe Microsoft has
acted in a legal and ethical manner and we look forward to presenting our
evidence to the Directorate-General,' the company added.
The EC antitrust investigation mirrors a similar probe by the US Justice
Department, which recently began a review of information gathered over three
years by the US Federal Trade Commission. The Justice Department intervened
after the FTC was deadlocked twice on whether to take action against
Microsoft.
While under FTC investigation, Microsoft made an offer to acquire Novell.
In the UK, the Office of Fair Trading has also looked into charges of
anticompetitive activities by Microsoft. However, the OFT is now believed to
have suspended its investigation in view of DG4's involvement.
Each company now accuses the other of having failed to negotiate in good
faith. Novell is bitter about what it sees as Microsoft's use of the
protracted merger talks to slow its attempts to compete in the PC operating
market. Microsoft says it was Novell that dragged the talks out and finally
called them off.
Novell acknowledged that it and 'other significant software companies' have
been involved in discussions with DG4 about Microsoft.
The complaint is understood to charge that Microsoft has deliberately
attempted to limit competition in the market for personal computer operating
systems. Microsoft, whose DOS operating system is used on about 90 per cent
of all PCs, offers PC manufacturers discounts if they agree to pay an
operating system licence fee for all of the computers of a particular model
sold. Novell claims that this 'per-processor licensing' arrangement
effectively excludes competition from its alternative DR-DOS program.
Novell is also understood to charge Microsoft with illegal 'tying' of sales
of one product to another.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has previously denied both of these
charges.
