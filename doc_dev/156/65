THE US Federal Trade Commission is investigating Microsoft, the world's
largest software company, in a wide-ranging anti-trust inquiry.
Microsoft said it had been told that the FTC would examine third-party
allegations that Microsoft 'has monopolised or has attempted to monopolise
the market for operating systems, operating environments, computer software
and computer peripherals for personal computers'.
The company supplies the DOS personal computer operating system used in all
IBM-compatible personal computers.
Microsoft is also the largest supplier of applications software for personal
computers.
The group's long-standing ties with IBM have given it a pivotal role in the
personal computer industry. If Microsoft is found to have violated
anti-trust laws, as some competitors privately charge, the outcome is likely
to have a broad impact throughout the computer industry.
Previously, Microsoft had understood the investigation to be narrowly
focused on a 1989 joint statement with IBM in which the companies were
alleged to have agreed to limit the functionality of Windows, a Microsoft
personal computer programme.
Mr William Neukom, Microsoft vice-president of law and corporate affairs,
said: 'Microsoft is surprised and disappointed that the inquiry has been
broadened.
'We will continue to co-operate with this investigation,' added. 'We believe
that Microsoft has acted in a legal and ethical manner.'
The FTC, which is charged with investigating business practices that
restrict competition, declined to comment on the existence of the inquiry,
or its nature.
Microsoft's share price fell from a Thursday close of Dollars 111 to trade
at Dollars 106 1/2 on news of the investigation by the Federal Trade
Commission.
