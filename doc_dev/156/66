NTT, the Japanese telecommunications company, and Microsoft, the US software
group, have agreed to co-operate in developing an interactive multimedia
system that could take Japan's ambitions in this area a step further towards
realisation.
Multimedia provides interactive text and video services to the home and
office.
The two companies are to develop the hardware and software, such as
video-on-demand, from both the supplier and customer ends.
The agreement follows a deal announced in March for the two companies to
develop a software distribution system. It brings together two of the most
powerful companies in their respective industries.
Under the deal, NTT will participate at the end of this year in an
interactive multimedia system being tested by Microsoft and TCI, the US
cable company.
Microsoft, in turn, will provide its multimedia system software for tests by
NTT, which will begin in 1995. The outcome of the joint development will be
used for these tests.
The interfaces the two companies will co-operate to develop could include
the links between the set-top box and telecommunications networks, the
server and networks, applications and set-top boxes, and the server and
service programmes, Microsoft said.
The set-top box is the hardware connected with the terminal, typically a
television set, to allow users to send and receive interactive information.
The server is a storage and processing unit that stores information such as
video, sound, voice and data and sends such information to users or receives
information back from users.
