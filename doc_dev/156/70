A COMPUTER software battle has erupted between Sun Microsystems, the leading
manufacturer of computer workstations, and Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company.
Sun has challenged Microsoft's dominant position in the software market by
announcing the joint development with Unix Systems Laboratories of
technology allowing Unix computers to run word processing, spreadsheet and
database applications designed for use on personal computers running
Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Sun said its new technology, known as Wabi and based on work by Praxsys
Technologies, would enable Unix system users to run Microsoft Windows
applications 'right out of the box'.
Until now this could be done only by using a software 'emulator' that acted
like a personal computer, degrading the performance of a Unix computer. Sun
claimed that, through Wabi, the performance of Unix computers running
Windows applications would be about 50 per cent higher than other computers
using the Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Sun's move is a pre-emptive attack on Microsoft's imminent high-performance
version of Windows, known as Windows NT.
Mr Scott McNealy, Sun Microsystems chief executive, said: 'We are taking
(Microsoft's) Windows volume standard and making it 'open'.' Computer users
would be able to exploit Windows applications without being dependent on
Microsoft, he added.
But Microsoft has announced it would also offer programmes enabling Windows
applications to run on Unix computers and Apple's Macintosh machines.
Microsoft questioned Sun's performance claims for Wabi. Mr Bill Gates,
chairman and chief executive, also said Microsoft would check Wabi for any
infringement of intellectual property rights. But Sun argued Wabi
technology, available to software developers in about 90 days, contained no
Microsoft technology.
