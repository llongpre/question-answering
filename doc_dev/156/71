<LEADPARA>  A powerful group of computer makers and software publishers is nearing an
agreement to develop a standard for an advanced desk-top computer that it
hopes will unseat the reigning powers of the personal computer hardware
industry by the middle of the decade.;    The emerging alliance, led by
Microsoft Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., is
gambling it can create a personal computer based on a chip design called RISC
that is simpler and faster than that used in computers made by International
Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc., the
leaders in the desk-top sector of the industry.  </LEADPARA>

NEW ALLIANCE HOPES RISC CHIP CAN UNSEAT IBM,

<TEXT>     Industry experts say RISC chips are far faster than those in today's most
powerful personal computers using conventional chips and are essential to
providing a range of powerful new computer functions, including video and 3-D
graphics and handwriting- and voice-recognition.;    The alliance's final form
is still to be determined and could be announced officially within a few
weeks. But because of the potency of RISC technology, the group's chances of
shifting the balance of power in the computer industry are high, industry
executives and analysts say.;    The challenge threatens not only the three
desk-top leaders but also the companies that dominate the market for the chips
in them: Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc.;    The emerging alliance was
established at a secret meeting in January in California. Several executives
who attended the meeting said the companies agreed to define standard
specifications for a personal computer to be built around a RISC chip designed
by Mips Computer Systems Inc. and software being developed by Microsoft and
the Santa Cruz Operation, a software publisher partly owned by Microsoft.;   
"It's the second coming of the PC," said an industry executive at one company
in the negotiations.;    The new class of personal computers will be based on
a chip Mips recently announced called the R4000. The new chip is based on a
technology known as reduced instruction-set computing, or RISC, which
significantly simplifies and speeds processing.;    It does so by eliminating
many of the instructions built into conventional chips, and instead processing
data by performing simpler steps repeatedly at faster speeds.;    The
executive said the computers would not be available until 1992 and that the
standard would not have a big impact on the industry until sometime in the
middle of the decade.;    Crucial to the alliance is Compaq, the third-largest
maker of personal computers, behind IBM and Apple. Recognizing the power of
RISC technology, Compaq has apparently decided to adopt a second type of
computer design.;    Compaq has had extensive discussions with Mips, Sun and
Hewlett-Packard Co. about different designs and is now preparing to choose
Mips, industry executives familiar with the negotiations said.;    "The battle
came down to Compaq being fought over by Sun and Microsoft," said Mark
Stahlman, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. "But it's not just a battle
for Compaq; it's a total realignment of the computer business.";    Also
crucial to the alliance is new software from two companies that have realized
they need to be in both the RISC camp and the existing camp. Microsoft is now
developing a new version of its OS/2 operating system that will incorporate
its popular Windows interface and run on a number of different types of
computers; Windows is already capturing the market of computers based on Intel
chips.;    The Santa Cruz Operation would offer a version of the Unix
operating system for the new RISC-based computers, just as it now offers one
for computers based on Intel's chips.;    Many industry executives believe
that by moving aggressively into RISC technology, Microsoft will be the
software standard setter for the next generation of desk-top computers,
stealing IBM's role.;    Under the emerging agreement, the new RISC-based
personal computers would also come equipped with powerful three-dimensional
graphics systems derived from those developed by Silicon Graphics Inc., a
Mountain View maker of work stations and member of the consortium.;   
Digital, which has failed in the personal-computer market and lags in the
work-station business, is looking for new entry through the alliance.;   
Notably missing from the new alliance are IBM and Hewlett-Packard, which offer
their own RISC-based chips for work stations but have not yet made a move for
such chips in their personal computers.;    The closer relationship between
Microsoft, Digital and Compaq presents problems for IBM. It may serve to
further distance IBM from Microsoft, with which it co-developed today's
dominant MS-DOS software standard.;    In addition to challenging Apple and
IBM, the alliance is aimed directly at powerful engineering and scientific
computers being offered by Sun, the leading maker in the market for more
powerful work stations. Sun has been moving toward the personal computer
market.;    The move would also serve as the first real competition to Intel's
domination of the personal-computer chip market. Intel officials are said to
have been involved in the negotiations, which began in July, but have since
withdrawn. Intel executives say their chips will be able to keep up with the
powerful new RISC chips.;    "Clearly this is a major threat to Intel and to
Sun," said Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor Report, a computer
industry newsletter.;    But some industry experts said it would be years
before the effectiveness of the new computer-industry order is clear.;   
"It's all geopolitics," said Jim P. Manzi, chairman of Lotus Development Corp.
"Nobody knows the meaning of these moves until it gets sorted out and people
start building things.";    In redrawing the battle lines in the computer
industry, the arrangement could affect many existing alliances, including the
Open Software Foundation, an early attempt to slow Sun's growth engineered by
IBM, Digital, Hewlett-Packard and a number of other computer makers.  </TEXT>
