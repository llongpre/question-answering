   ARMONK N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp.
lowered prices on its OS/2 operating software, and unveiled
an agreement with Micrografx Inc. that will bolster the
capabilities of the OS/2 system.
   Both moves came as IBM launched a week of events designed
to promote OS/2 more aggressively. The product, which IBM has
deemed critical to its future, has come under increasing
pressure in the past year from a program called Windows, sold
by Microsoft Corp.

   OS/2 is a personal-computer operating system, meaning it
coordinates the basic functions of a personal computer. OS/2
is more powerful than DOS, the current standard for
IBM-compatible machines, and was seen by both IBM and
Microsoft as an eventual replacement for DOS.
   But last year Microsoft introduced a wildly popular
version of Windows, a DOSenhancing product that has become
somewhat of a juggernaut in the computer world. Since then,
Microsoft has distanced itself from OS/2 while IBM has
struggled to explain exactly why such an advanced operating
system is needed.
   The price changes are intended to eliminate at least one
objection to OS/2: that it is too expensive. The licensing
fee for the cheapest version of the program, for example,
will drop by more than half, to $150 from $340. Furthermore,
current DOS users can upgrade to OS/2 for $99, and new OS/2
customers can also get IBM's much-hyped new version of OS/2,
due later this year, at no charge.
   IBM continued to talk up the new version of OS/2, which it
has previously said will run DOS and Windows programs without
modification. The development agreement with Micrografx,
which is based in Richardson, Texas, expands that capability
by allowing software companies to give their Windows programs
extra functions when running under OS/2.
