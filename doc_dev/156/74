FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Programmed for the Microsoft
challenge - Novell's expansion has pitted it directly against the market
leader

The balance of power in the computer software industry has shifted
unexpectedly towards the state of Utah, home of Novell, the leading supplier
of software for personal computer networks.
Novell announced late on Monday that it planned to acquire WordPerfect, a
Utah neighbour, for Dollars 1.4bn in stock. At the same time, Novell has
purchased the rights to a popular spreadsheet program called Quattro Pro
from Borland International for Dollars 145m in cash.
Novell shares closed down in heavy trading yesterday, at Dollars 20 from
Dollars 23 3/4 on Monday.
The moves give Novell an instant stake in the market for application
programs, with WordPerfect's word processors and Borland's spreadsheet.
They also transform Novell into a software powerhouse with annual revenues
of close to Dollars 2bn, second only to Microsoft, the world's largest
software company with revenues last year of Dollars 3.75bn.
For the first time, Microsoft will face competition from a company with the
size and breadth of products to challenge its own market dominance.
Novell seems to relish the opportunity for a market battle. There is no love
lost between Novell and 'the boys from Seattle', as Mr Raymond Noorda,
Novell chief executive, calls Microsoft's youthful executives.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has charged that Novell 'has a vendetta
against us', and Mr Noorda has accused Microsoft of anti-competitive
business practices.
Microsoft is being investigated by the US Justice Department, and Novell has
played an active role in providing information to the anti-trust
investigators. Novell has also filed an anti-trust complaint against
Microsoft in Europe.
However, Mr Noorda carefully avoided any comment on Microsoft yesterday, and
analysts said his plans to expand Novell may shift attention away from
Microsoft's market dominance.
Until now, Novell has competed with Microsoft only in the area of operating
systems, the software that controls the basic functions of a computer or
network of computers.
Novell's Netware is the leading network operating system. Last year, Novell
also acquired Unix, a computer operating system widely used in 'open
systems' computing. Novell faces increasing competition, however, from
Microsoft's recently-introduced Windows NT, an operating system for
networked computer systems.
With its acquisition of WordPerfect and purchase of Borland's spreadsheet,
Novell will now go head to head with Microsoft in the booming market for
office software 'suites', or bundles of business software applications,
including word-processing, spreadsheets and database management.
Novell also plans to leverage its leadership in networking software to
create a class of applications products called 'groupware', aimed at teams
of workers.
Such software would include messaging, task management, document management
and workflow tools, Novell said. In this market segment, Novell will compete
with Microsoft and Lotus Development, the third-largest personal computer
software company.
'The era of stand-alone personal computing is evolving into group
collaboration that connects individuals, groups and companies,' said Mr
Noorda. 'Novell's objective is to accelerate this market transition.'
Yet Novell's expansionary moves also reflect tough times in the software
industry, as smaller companies find it increasingly difficult to compete
with 'mighty Microsoft', with its broad distribution and marketing clout,
and to keep pace with a price war.
WordPerfect and Borland have both lost market share over the past year,
according to market analysts. WordPerfect has recently laid off more than
1,000 employees, or 17 per cent of its workforce. Borland has faced cashflow
problems as it slashed prices in an attempt to gain market share. Borland
said on Monday it would restructure its operations, following the sale to
Novell of its leading product. Large staff cuts are expected.
Novell's extensive distribution network, with 25,000 resellers worldwide,
could breath new life into WordPerfect and Borland's spreadsheet business,
industry analysts say.
Novell faces the challenge, however, of integrating the new businesses into
its established operations. 'Mergers are difficult in any industry, but more
so in software because you have to combine different code bases, as well as
different cultures,' said Mr Pete Higgins, Microsoft vice-president.
However, Novell is not new to these challenges. Over the past 10 years the
company has acquired no fewer than 15 software companies, although none the
size of WordPerfect.
And Mr Noorda says long-standing friendships between executives of the two
companies, whose offices are just a few miles apart, will help to make the
combination 'a natural merger'.
A more pressing problem for Novell is who will replace Mr Noorda, who at 69
is about to retire. 'We are on track to find my successor by mid-June,' said
Mr Noorda, who has been talking to several industry executives outside the
company.
Thus, although Mr Noorda may have realised his dream of creating a new
'software powerhouse', the newly-expanded Novell faces significant
uncertainties. It also remains to be seen how Lotus Development will react
to Novell's expansion plans.
Four years ago, Lotus and Novell aborted a planned merger, after the two
companies failed to agree on who should head the merged businesses. Mr
Noorda says he recently rejected an attempt by Lotus to resurrect talks.
Novell's acquisitions do, however, confirm a broad trend in the software
industry toward consolidation. Last week, Aldus and Adobe Systems, two
leaders in desktop publishing software, also announced plans to merge.
