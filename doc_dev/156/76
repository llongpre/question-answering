Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, is to set up
subsidiaries in
Hungary, Russia, Czechoslovakia and Poland, becoming the first software
company to establish a broad presence in eastern Europe, writes Louise Kehoe
in San Francisco.
Microsoft said its decision to expand there follows solid growth over the
last 18 months of sales through distribution networks in these countries.
Microsoft also plans to introduce 16 products for the new European markets
by the second quarter of 1993, including its popular 'Windows' operating
system.
