Sega, the Japanese group, plans a link-up with Microsoft of the US to
develop an advanced video games machine in a venture with far-reaching
implications for the world electronics industry.
The deal could give Microsoft, which provides software for more than 90 per
cent of the world's business personal computers, similar dominance in the
market for home entertainment.
The venture was confirmed by Sega, although Microsoft would not be drawn
last night on any relationship with the Japanese group, saying reports were
'speculative'.
According to Sega, the companies will co-operate on the Saturn project, a
games console combining video images, stereo sound and telecommunications.
Sega will make the computers and Microsoft will provide the operating
software.
Microsoft's software for Saturn would give the machine advanced graphics and
data processing capabilities, although it would be cheaper than standard
home computers.
Co-operation between Microsoft and Sega could lead to a new industry
standard for home entertainment software. The US company has grown to a
turnover of Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.53bn) in 10 years through licensing
deals that put its software on every IBM and IBM clone of personal computer.
The implication is that software houses developing educational and games
programs might have to write their products to Microsoft's standard, just as
business software developers have to work with Microsoft's MS-Dos and
Windows operating system.
The prospective tie-up comes as other companies in the video games,
electronics and computer industries have been taking positions in
preparation for what is expected to be fierce competition ahead.
Nintendo of Japan and Silicon Graphics, the US company, agreed last year to
co-operate in developing Nintendo's advanced games machine. Matsushita, the
consumer electronics company, has brought out an advanced games machine
developed by the US venture company 3DO. Sega has already formed an alliance
with TeleCommunications, the US cable TV company, and entertainment group
Time-Warner.
