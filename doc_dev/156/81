FT  19 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft has escaped the nightmare of being broken up. But its weekend deal
with the US Justice Department and the European Commission is more than a
slap on the wrist. To avoid a lengthy court battle over claims that it
behaved anti-competitively, the software giant has had to accept
restrictions on the way it conducts its business. While the detailed terms
certainly do not spell an immediate end to its near-monopoly in supplying
personal computer operating systems, rivals should find it easier to
penetrate the market.
Even more serious is the risk that close monitoring by the competition
authorities for the next six and a half years will cramp Microsoft's style.
One of the secrets of the group's success has been an aggressive
no-hostages-taken approach to competitors. It may now feel it has to tone
down this aggression.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder, was playing down such risks yesterday.
According to him, the deal eliminates the possible distraction of a court
case and allows the company to focus on devising new products. Certainly,
Microsoft's main challenge will be in the marketplace. Computer technology
is advancing at such a pace that the group will need to innovate to retain
its dominance in desktop operating systems. As Microsoft seeks to establish
itself in other segments of the software market such as networking and
multimedia, the need for innovation will be even greater.
