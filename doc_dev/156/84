Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has avoided
potentially costly legal actions on both sides of the Atlantic by settling
charges that it used anti-competitive practices to maintain a mono-poly in
the personal computer market.
The deal between Microsoft, the US Justice Department and the European
Commission settles one of the biggest antitrust investigations since the
break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph, the US telephone group, in
1984.
The settlement, which requires Microsoft to drop some alleged monopolistic
practices, marks the end of a four-year investigation which involved
unprecedented co-operation between competition authorities in the US and
Europe.
In a telling judgment upon the methods Microsoft used to maintain its
predominance in the software industry, the US Justice Department said:
'While the company fairly and legally climbed to the top of the industry
ladder, it used unfair and illegal practices to maintain its dominant
position.'
Microsoft, with annual revenues of Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3bn), dominates the
personal computer software industry with its operating systems installed in
more than 120m machines. Operating systems act as the 'central nervous
system' of a computer, controlling its basic functions.
The company founded by Mr Bill Gates, a young entrepreneur who has become
one of the richest people in the world, has faced increasing criticism for
commercial practices which its competitors allege limit their ability to
break into the market.
Microsoft provided the operating system for the original International
Business Machines PC in 1981. This became a world standard and allowed
Microsoft to become the leader in its field.
The US authorities, announcing the settlement on Saturday, said Microsoft
had 'built a barricade of exclusionary and unreasonably restrictive
licensing agreements to deny others an opportunity to develop and market
competing products'.
Ms Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust
division of the US Justice Department, said: 'Microsoft is an American
success story, but there is no excuse for any company to try to cement its
success through unlawful means, as Microsoft has done.'
She added: 'This case sends a powerful message that the antitrust
authorities of the US and the EC are prepared to move decisively and
promptly to pool resources to attack conduct by multinational firms that
violate the antitrust laws of the two jurisdictions.'
The Justice Department antitrust suit cites in particular Microsoft's 'per
processor' licensing contracts, which require personal computer
manufacturers to pay royalties to Microsoft based on the number of computers
they sell, regardless of whether Microsoft programs are installed.
