The US personal computer industry was yesterday bracing itself for
potentially serious disruption of its sales, following a court verdict that
Microsoft's widely-used personal computer operating system software
infringes two patents held by Stac Electronics, a California software
company.
A Los Angeles jury found on Wednesday that Microsoft has incorporated data
compression features in the latest versions of its MS-DOS operating system
that infringe Stac's patents, and ordered Microsoft to pay Dollars 120m in
compensatory damages. Microsoft is to take a charge in the current quarter,
reducing earnings by 26 cents per share.
The court was yesterday considering whether to issue an injunction ordering
Microsoft to halt sales of MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2, the current versions of the
operating system that are pre-loaded on most PCs. If granted, the injunction
could temporarily halt shipments of personal computers in the US.
Microsoft said it would issue new versions that do not include the data
compression features later this week.
'We do not anticipate any material disruption of the supply of MS-DOS
products,' said Bill Neukom, Microsoft senior vice-president of law and
corporate affairs, 'but we are not saying that this will not cause
disruption in the PC industry.'
Microsoft officials acknowledged they were assuming that personal computers
already shipped to retailers would not be affected. However, Mr Gary Clow,
president and chief executive of Stac Electronics, said he understood the
award was on the basis of shipments up to the end of January.
If Mr Clow is correct, PC retailers could be forced to return PCs to
manufacturers to replace the software. If Microsoft's view prevails, PC
manufacturers will have to swap the software they are installing in PCs. In
either case, PC sales could be interrupted.
Stac said it will seek 'the maximum relief available under the law' in its
request for an injunction. However, Mr Clow said the company had no
intention of disrupting PC shipments. 'Our beef is with Microsoft, not the
PC makers,' said Mr Clow.
Stac Electronics' data compression technology doubles the amount of data
that can be stored on a personal computer hard disk file. Microsoft
initially sought to license Stac's technology.
Mr Clow said he held licensing negotiations with Microsoft in 1992, but the
companies had been unable to reach agreement. Subsequently, Microsoft
introduced MS-DOS 6.0, a new version of its PC operating system that
includes data compression technology.
While the court ruled that Microsoft's data compression method infringes
Stac's patents, the jury said the infringement was not 'wilful'.
Microsoft plans to ask the judge to overturn the ruling and, if he refuses,
will appeal, the company said.
The court also awarded damages of Dollars 13.6m to Microsoft, for Stac's use
of Microsoft trade secrets.
