   REDMOND, Wash. -- Microsoft Corp. said it will license a
new computer operating system to Digital Equipment Corp. The
agreement, which was expected, broadens the relationship
between the two companies.
   In a separate announcement, Digital, of Maynard, Mass.,
said it will offer a computer networking system made by
Novell Inc. Digital already sells a competing network
offering made by Microsoft.

   Microsoft said it will license its Windows NT operating
system to Digital. That system, which is still under
development, will allow Microsoft's popular Windows program
to run on larger computers, such as workstations. Windows,
which now runs on personal computers, is a program that makes
software easier to use by opening menus, or choosing icons
with a pointing device.
   The strengthening of its ties to Digital, the No. 2
computer maker, comes at a time when Microsoft's relations
have chilled with the industry leader, International Business
Machines Corp. As reported, Digital recently agreed to be one
of a few computer makers that will display a Windows logo in
its advertising and packaging. Last year, Microsoft said
Digital would manufacture many of Microsoft's office
productivity applications, as part of what the company called
a "pragmatic" relationship between the two concerns.
   However, Digital's decision to license a PC networking
system from Novell, of Provo, Utah, is a sign that
Microsoft's networking software business continues to
struggle. Novell, which holds the lion's share of that
market, has been working with Digital since 1989.
