FT  21 JUL 93 / Market bully or go-ahead enterprise?: Anti-trust charges
against Microsoft

FOR ALMOST three years, Microsoft, the world's largest computer software
company and the dominant supplier of programs for use on personal computers,
has been the subject of a 'non public' anti-trust investigation by the US
Federal Trade Commission.
The investigation has been far from secret, however, with several Microsoft
competitors eagerly assisting the FTC, and unnamed agency 'sources'
providing regular updates to the computer trade press.
As an extraordinarily successful company and an aggressive competitor,
Microsoft has more than its share of detractors in the software industry.
They allege that Microsoft has used nefarious tactics deliberately to
constrain competition and achieve its market leadership.
Novell, one of Microsoft's strongest competitors and the leading supplier of
personal computer networking software, has spearheaded the attack, hiring
Washington lobbyists to raise political support for anti-trust action
against Microsoft.
'Ray Noorda, Novell chairman and chief executive, is totally committed to
the case as a matter of principle,' says Wendy Goldman Rohm, author of The
FTC versus Microsoft: the Inside Story, which is to be published soon. On
Monday, she says, 'a team of Novell attorneys gave presentations to the
commissioners, hoping that they would restrict Microsoft's practices.'
In particular, Novell alleges that Microsoft's system of 'per processor'
licences for MS-DOS and Windows, its widely used PC programs, has a serious
anti-competitive effect on the software market. Microsoft offers discounts
to PC manufacturers that agree to pay a royalty fee for the right to install
MS-DOS and Windows on all the computers they sell. Novell claims that this
in effect excludes competitors such as itself.
Others in the industry charge that Microsoft uses its near monopoly in the
operating system software market to gain unfair advantage over competitors
in the market for PC applications programs.
Microsoft says it is legally constrained from commenting directly on the
FTC's deliberations, but has denied wrong-doing and continues to co-operate
with the investigation.
In February, an FTC vote deadlocked, two for and two against, on whether to
seek a court injunction against Microsoft. Today the commission will
consider a revised and much narrower case against Microsoft. It is believed
to focus upon alleged abuse of product warranties to tie customers'
guarantees to use of other Microsoft programs, as well as allegations that
Microsoft deliberately and falsely gave users of test versions of Windows
the impression that the program would not work properly with competing PC
operating systems such as Novell's DR-DOS.
Whatever decision the commission reaches today, it is not expected to have
an immediate impact upon Microsoft's business. The Commission will not seek
'structural changes,' such as breaking up the company, Ms Goldman Rohm
predicts. Nonetheless, the case could have a broad impact on the computer
software industry by forcing Microsoft to be more restrained in its
competitive tactics, providing other companies with an opportunity to unseat
the industry leader.
Microsoft has sold about 30m copies of Windows since its launch three years
ago and about 100m copies of MS-DOS over the past 12 years. Net income for
fiscal year 1992, ending June 1992, was Dollars 708m (Pounds 472m) on
revenues of Dollars 2.8bn.
If the FTC votes to seek an injunction against Microsoft, it could simply
consent and avoid a trial. Were Microsoft to fight the case, it runs the
risk of becoming embroiled in a legal battle that could last years,
reminiscent of International Business Machines' battles with the Justice
Department.
The Microsoft case is also being closely watched for clues about the Clinton
administration's stand on anti-trust law enforcement after 12 years of
Republican rule in the White House during which a 'let the market decide'
philosophy toward non-merger anti-trust cases prevailed.
Should the FTC again reach deadlock over whether to carry the Microsoft case
forward, the US justice department is poised to take over the case,
according to Ms Goldman Rohm.
For Microsoft, win or lose, the message is that as a big and successful
company, it needs to be aware of the anti-trust implications of its business
practices.
So far, however, Microsoft has been reluctant to accept such constraints,
which it believes could be damaging to its competitiveness.
While other software companies characterise Microsoft as a bully, Microsoft
itself is still battling to stay ahead.
