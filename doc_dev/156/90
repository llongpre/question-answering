FT  01 FEB 94 / Technology: Slippery slope for user support - An extra cost
faced by purchasers of PC software

Personal computer software is increasingly cheaper to buy, but the real cost
of using it is rising. Several leading PC software publishers have begun to
charge for 'premium' support services for their products, on top of the
'free' support included in the purchase price of a software licence.
Lotus Development, for example, is now offering fee-based support for Lotus
1-2-3 and Ami Pro - after pioneering the approach on its enterprise-wide
Lotus Notes communications system. Microsoft, too, now charges for extra
support on its Microsoft Office products having established a precedent with
charges on support for its Windows NT and MS-Dos operating systems.
The worry for users is that this is possibly the top of a very slippery
slope and that they may find themselves having to pay for all software
support.
Two recent trends are fuelling this fear: the drastic drop in PC software
prices and the increasing complexity of the programs. Both are linked to the
popularity of software 'suite' bundles, in which several applications are
bundled together at a lower price than the sum of the individual
applications.
While software is getting cheaper, it is also more unwieldy. And that means
that support, as well as user training, is likely to become a much more
important part of a company's information technology costs. Deployment of
that support is a problem which all users must tackle.
Perhaps aware that annual support contracts like those in the mainframe and
minicomputer sectors might make PC users rebel, PC software makers have been
clever in the way they have introduced fee-based support for applications.
In the US, Lotus, for example, offers users a choice of support packages.
They may dial into a '900' toll telephone number at the rate of Dollars 2
(Pounds 1.30) per minute (the first minute is free) for 24-hour support on
its flagship Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.
Alternatively, Lotus users can pay a Dollars 129 annual support contract for
applications or Dollars 295 per year per user for Lotus Notes support. Lotus
still offers basic free technical support for most of its products for the
first 90 days after purchase - as well as a dial-in bulletin board and a
'forum' area on the CompuServe online information service.
Microsoft offers a similar range of support services in the US - along with
a more varied range of options for developers and corporations. But
according to Tony Ettlinger, Microsoft UK director of product support
services, these are not designed to be profit centres.
Ettlinger says they are merely designed to cover most of the costs of
providing services that users - particularly those in large corporations -
are demanding. 'There is no way we are making a move to provide product
support at a profit,' he says. 'In the case of Windows NT, we decided on
something we thought would be a fair and reasonable charge for support.'
Microsoft has also been encouraging third parties to provide support for its
new Windows NT operating system. Traditional minicomputer makers such as
Digital Equipment, NCR and Hewlett-Packard have all started fee-based NT
support services in the past six months, with the backing of Microsoft.
Microsoft's rationale for this move is that it does not want to have to
create the kind of support infrastructure that a minicomputer-level
operating system such as NT demands, although it does want one to exist. By
involving third parties experienced in providing this kind of support, it
hopes to get the best of both worlds: a solid base of support for users and
strong backing for NT by minicomputer vendors, both at little cost to
Microsoft.
But if price-slashing and bundling continues at current rates, software
companies may have to change the policy of not seeing support as a profit
centre. It may become the only place left to make money in the PC industry.
