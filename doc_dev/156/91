A GROUP of leading computer companies yesterday announced plans to develop a
'unified' version of Unix, the computer operating system software that has
long been touted as a standard for 'open systems' - computers that can share
software and data. The move follows years of industry in-fighting.
The group includes IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems as well as
software companies The Santa Cruz Operation, Novell and Unix System
Laboratories, a unit of AT&amp;T.
It said that it would work to establish software standards. There are
numerous incompatible versions of Unix, and the fragmentation has caused
confusion, stunting the growth of open systems.
By establishing a standard version of Unix, the group aims to encourage
software developers to write new applications programs for Unix, thus making
their computer and software products more attractive.
An operating system is the software that controls the basic functions of a
computer. Applications software, such as accounting systems or
word-processing programs, are generally designed to run on a single
operating system and must be rewritten if they are to run on a different
one.
Over the past few years there has been a series of failed efforts by
industry groups to establish a single standard version of Unix.
This latest group may be more successful, however, because it includes
former antagonists, analysts said.
The group may also be more highly motivated to work together because Unix
faces a new challenger in Microsoft's Windows NT, a powerful computer
operating system that is expected to be launched in May.
