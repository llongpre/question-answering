Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, aims to boost its
operations in Latin America, the fastest growing market for personal
computer software.
The company will open a regional office in Miami, and double the number of
employees dedicated to marketing and support of Microsoft products in Latin
America.
Microsoft's sales there rose 174 per cent last year, making it the fastest
growing market for the company, said Orlando Ayala, senior director of Latin
American operations.
Microsoft plans to establish manufacturing partnerships in Brazil and Mexico
in May. This will allow it to produce products locally for these and
neighbouring countries.
By increasing the level of product support to customers, Microsoft's moves
may help to combat rampant software piracy in Latin America. According to
data released this week by the Software Publishers Association, Latin
American countries have some of the highest rates of software piracy in the
world.
Illegal copies of PC software represent 89 per cent of software in use in
Brazil, 82 per cent in Mexico, and 95 per cent in other Latin American
countries, the industry group said.
Microsoft also announced management changes in its European operations, in
line with its recent re-organisation of worldwide marketing. Regional
executives have been reassigned to reflect the increasing segmentation of
the software market into corporate, individual and computer industry
customers.
The company is also focusing more on the emerging central European market,
where it sees potential for sales of Dollars 1bn over the next few years.
Microsoft employs more than 2,500 people in Europe, where its retail sales
were Dollars 1.2bn in fiscal year 1993, up 26 per cent over the previous
year.
