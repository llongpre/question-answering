FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Microsoft alters distribution
chain for Europe

MICROSOFT, the world's largest personal computer software supplier, is
changing its European distribution methods as part of its strategy of
retreating from activities other than software development and manufacture.
It plans to eliminate one link in the software distribution chain to
European customers.
The group intends to open a European distribution centre at its
manufacturing facility in Dublin, Ireland, which will eventually provide a
single warehouse and distribution service for its European distributors.
In the UK, Microsoft's principal distributors are Merisel and Frontline.
The new Irish distribution centre will remove the need to carry inventory in
each country and Microsoft's warehouses will be phased out over the next
year.
The company has been acting as its own master distributor in Europe,
importing products separately in each country and supplying them to
distributors.
'Microsoft is a software company, not a distributor and if we are to
continue to be successful we must focus on this,' said Mr Bernard Vergnes,
president of Microsoft Europe.
'In the past five years we have seen Europe move towards being a single
market with more companies wanting to do business at a pan-European level,'
he added.
The company is working with distributors to establish electronic links which
will enable products to be manufactured to order.
Distributors will place orders directly with the manufacturing plant.
Microsoft operates this system in the US where it deals with only three main
distributors.
In comparison, it has arrangements with almost 100 distributors in Europe.
The company's Irish manufacturing plant is producing software at the rate of
about 12m units a year.
