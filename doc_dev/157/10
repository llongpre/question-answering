<LEADPARA>  IN THE official NBA Register, in the section titled "All-Time Greats," on
Pages 292 and 293, compressed into 67 lines of type is the basketball career
of one Nathaniel Archibald, more familiarly known as Nate or Tiny, a
cherubic-faced child of the Bronx who fought his way out and, much more
significantly, fought his way back in.;    Monday night, in Springfield,
Mass., Tiny Archibald was one of seven men enshrined in the Basketball Hall of
Fame.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     His likeness, cast in bronze, will appear in the building named for James
Naismith, who invented the game that Tiny Archibald elevated to another level.
You like to think that Naismith would have a special fondness for Archibald,
who was a comparative runt at 6-foot-1, 160 pounds, but who befuddled the
bigger people with his fearless, slashing sorties down the lane and his
clever, creative passing. Left-handed, he would nail the pull-up jumper or
ride on invisible currents of air to the hoop, a sprite whose eyes shone with
excitement and the simple joy of playing. Peter Pan in sneaks.;    Tiny
Archibald is in the Hall of Fame on extravagant statistical merit, having
amassed more than 16,000 points, more than 6,400 assists, more than 2,000
rebounds in 13 professional seasons. That is a most impressive career
triple-double.;    But there is another, rarer, more admirable triple that
Tiny Archibald is soon to complete. It is an educational triple. He has
acquired his bachelor's degree and his master's, and now he is closing in on
his doctorate, in education. Tiny, the Ph.D. Dr. Archibald. It has a certain
ring.;    Now 42, he resides in the Bronx, father of five. He has, indeed,
gone home again. But more, he is one of the special ones who make a
difference. In the mornings, he serves as a recreation director for homeless
men, talking to them, not down to them: "I grew up with a lot of these guys;
they know I'm just trying to help them realize they can make it, too.";    In
the afternoons, he makes the rounds of elementary and junior high schools,
counseling, encouraging, just as he remembers being inspired when he was
younger: "Just trying to pass it on.";    In the evenings, he attends classes
at Fordham University, closing in on that educational triple. It is an object
lesson in persistence and perseverance.;    Tiny Archibald learned the city
game on the asphalt proving grounds of the Bronx, went to Arizona Western,
then to Texas-El Paso, then to the NBA. In the 1970 draft, he was taken in the
second round by Cincinnati. He would be traded three times, waived once,
signed as a free agent once. He would be on the roster of five different teams
between 1970 and 1984. He would miss one entire season with a torn Achilles'
tendon. He would be an all-NBA first-teamer three times, second team twice. He
would be an All-Star Game MVP. He would be a member of a championship team.;  
 In short, there was nothing in the mad, nomadic, intoxicating, chaotic,
potentially destructive life of a professional athlete that Tiny Archibald
would miss, from the champagne-spray giddiness of the championship ring to the
bleak despair of the surgeon's scalpel.;    If the sport ever gets around to
compiling an official register that lists what a man did with his life after
he stopped bouncing the ball, then top billing belongs to Tiny Archibald, who
scours the shelters and the schools, nurtures the abandoned and the confused,
a Pied Piper of the sidewalks, the steam vents and the playgrounds.;    The
only thing about him that doesn't fit is his nickname. In all that truly
matters, Tiny is a giant.  </TEXT>
