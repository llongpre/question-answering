   Former Chief Justice Earl Warren, songwriter
Cole Porter, the game of basketball and the effort to explore space
are among the subjects planned for the nation's 1991 postage
stamps.
   The year is expected to lead off with a flower stamp, carrying
no cost denomination, and a so-called make-up-rate stamp.
   New postage rates are expected to take effect in late January or
early February, with a 30-cent first class charge considered
likely.
   But the rate won't be determined until the Postal Rate
Commission reports next month, so non-denominated stamps have been
printed to handle any eventuality.
   As with past rate changes, the stamps carry a letter, and the
progression is up to ``F.'' This stamp will carry a flower design
to match the letter, much as the last such stamp, lettered E,
carried an image of the Earth.
   In addition, the make-up stamp will be valued at the amount of
the cost increase - which means that adding it to a 25-cent stamp
will equal the new rate. The design for this stamp hasn't been
disclosed yet.
   The first regular stamp issue of 1991 will come on Jan. 25 as a
4-cent coil stamp featuring a steam carriage. Part of the
transportation series, the first issue will occur in Tucson, Ariz.
   A 50-cent stamp will be issued Feb. 22 jointly in Washington and
Berne, Switzerland, commemorating Switzerland's 700th anniversary.
   The 200th anniversary of Vermont statehood will be observed in
March with a stamp to be released in Bennington.
   The face value of this and many other stamps to be issued in
1991 will be determined by the decision in the pending rate case.
   On April 1, New York will be the scene for the issue of a postal
card commemorating the 100th anniversary of Carnegie Hall.
   Also in April, a Great Americans stamp will be issued in
Albuquerque, N.M., honoring former Senator Denis Chavez. A stamp
featuring a flag over Mt. Rushmore will be released at Mt. Rushmore
in South Dakota, and a stamp showing the U.S. flag and Olympic
rings will be issued.
   Savings bonds will be featured on a stamp to be issued May 1 in
Washington and another flag stamp will be issued May 30 in
Waterloo, N.Y.
   Honolulu will be the issue site May 9 for two new ``Love''
stamps.
   The annual Literary Arts stamp will feature William Saroyan,
being issued May 22 jointly in Fresno, Calif., and Yerevan, Soviet
Union.
   A Great Americans stamp honoring former Vice President Hubert
Humphrey will be issued May 27 in Minneapolis.
   The Cole Porter stamp will be issued June 8 in Peru, Ind.
   Also in June, the ``Old Red'' administration building at the
University of Texas' Galveston branch will be featured on a postal
card.
   A $1 Olympic logo stamp will be issued in June, and a summer
Olympics set of five stamp designs will be released in Los Angeles
in July.
   The Antarctic Treaty will be featured on an air mail stamp set
for June 21 in Washington.
   A commemorative stamp to honor coin collecting will be issued
Aug. 13 in Chicago.
   A sheet of 10 stamp designs will recall World War II. It i
scheduled for issue in August, but the date and place have not been
determined.
   Springfield, Mass., where basketball was invented, will be the
site for the issuance of a stamp commemorating the birth of that
sport. It will be released Aug. 26.
   Washington will be the site for a District of Columbia
commemorative stamp Sept. 7. The 200th anniversary of the Bill of
Rights will be marked by a stamp to be issued in September in
Richmond, Va.
   And a booklet with five designs honoring comedians also will be
issued in September, the site yet to be announced.
   Space exploration will be commemorated in 10 different stamp
designs, scheduled for release as a booklet Oct. 1 in Pasadena,
Calif.
   A stamped envelope commemorating the magazine industry is
scheduled for issue in Naples, Fla., in October, the same month
that a stamp will appear recalling the World Columbia Exhibition.
   A postal card noting the University of Notre Dame administration
building will be released Oct. 13 in South Bend, Ind.
   The traditional Christmas stamp will be issued in Houston and
the contemporary version in Santa, Ind., both on Oct. 17.
   Dates have not been determined for three stamps. The Earl Warren
stamp, which will be issued in Washington; a Black Heritage stamp
featuring Jan Matzelinger will be released in Lynn, Mass., and a
booklet of five stamps featuring fishing flies also will be issued.
Matzelinger invented a machine that revolutionized the shoemaking
industry.
