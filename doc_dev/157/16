<LEADPARA>  James Naismith's gym is long gone. But just a few blocks away from where
Naismith tacked up his peach baskets a century ago, his game lives on at the
parquet floor of the Dunbar Community Center.;   To find the white columned
19th century church building that director George "Big Will" Williams likes to
call the "holiest gym in the nation," you have to turn your back on the
Basketball Hall of Fame and head into the bleak blocks up the hill where
George Washington decided to build a munitions plant called the Springfield
Armory.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     They took the pews out for basketball around 1920 when the Olivet Church,
started nearly a century earlier, fell on hard times and merged with the South
Congregational Church. One condition of the merger was that the old church
become a "community house.";   "Drugs were rampant, unemployment was high, and
the young people had no place to go," Williams said, as some 7-year-olds shot
around underneath the panels illustrating lines from Paul Laurence Dunbar's
poetry that replaced the stained glass windows. "It was started to combat the
same problems we face today.;   "This has always been a working class
neighborhood. And black or white, a lot of the kids couldn't afford other
programs. Our policy is never to turn a kid away.";   For more than 70 years,
Dunbar has kept that trust. More than 300 youngsters are now involved in
basketball, karate, boxing, dance and many cultural programs that all have
gained a measure of national attention. Some of the instructors, including a
University of Massachusetts student named Julius Erving, who put in a
work-study stint in the 1970s, have done all right as well.;   "It's a parent
away from home," Bobbie Best said. Her husband, Leo, who won the trophy given
to the city's top high school basketball player in the 1950s, and son, Travis,
the city's centennial gift to the game, are both in the Dunbar Hall of Fame.
Now at Georgia Tech, where he is considered one of the best freshmen point
guards in the nation, Travis Best led undefeated Central High to the state
high school basketball championship last season.;   Mrs. Best played her
basketball in the church league, but said "Dunbar was and still is the place
to be.";   "It added a lot more to young people's lives than just sports," she
said.  </TEXT>
