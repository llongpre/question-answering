<LEADPARA>  IN the wake of the week:;   (check) Damn the rules, put Magic Johnson in the
Hall of Fame this year.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PUT MAGIC IN HALL NOW  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     (check) A guy can really wear himself out getting on and off the 49ers
bandwagon.;   (check) Hey, how'd that Tyson-Holyfield fight come out last
night?;   (check) I'm pro-Bono.;   (check) ESPN's Chris Berman is picking the
49ers to beat New Orleans 12-11. I guess he expects the Saints to score a
safety, somehow.;   (check) Something to consider before betting the farm on
Stanford today: The Cardinal's four straight wins have come against Cornell,
Southern Cal, Oregon State and Oregon -- four really bad teams.;   (check) Jim
Thorpe shot a 64 in the opening round of the PGA event at Hilton Head. Man,
that guy can do everything.;   (check) Warriors rookie Billy Owens says the
person he would most like to meet is boxer Terry Norris. Aim higher, Billy.;  
(check) Bobby Hansen, traded by Sacramento to the Chicago Bulls, must feel
like the luckiest man alive.;   IF you saw Tim McKyer knocked silly by a
blindside hit away from the ball Sunday, you know how 49ers tight end Jamie
Williams felt about being called "a sellout" by McKyer.;   (check) Prediction:
Mike Cofer will kick better this Sunday.;   (check) Jeff Hostetler must be
paying Ray Handley, the New York Giants' coach.;   (check) Mitch Richmond put
up 24 shots in his second game with the Sacramento Kings, and why not? They
don't count for much up there.;   (check) I've got absolutely no problem with
Terry Bradshaw calling Jerry Rice "the greatest receiver ever to play the
game." But I wonder if Lynn Swann does.;   (check) Happy 100th birthday to . .
. the Swiss Army knife, invented in 1891.;   (check) The L.A. Rams giving the
New Orleans Saints a game last week means the Saints can be beaten, especially
with young Steve Walsh at quarterback.;   (check) I saw some footage of Koy
Detmer, the younger brother of the Brigham Young quarterback, and the Texas
high school senior, although small, throws a real nice ball.;   (check)
Congratulations to Buffalo on its Global Basketball Association franchise, the
Wings. Buffalo Wings, get it?;   (check) Just wait until those World Cup
soccer officials get a blast of that 5 o'clock Candlestick wind.;   TOMMY JOHN
finally found a way to resume his pitching career. He has taken the job as
commissioner of the Sunshine Baseball League, which begins play soon with six
teams and a 56-game schedule.;   (check) I bet Eric Dickerson is all broken up
about not getting to play for the Indianapolis Colts the next four weeks.;  
(check) For the Owens trade to really work for the Warriors, Sarunas
Marciulionis better start playing better.;   (check) One night after Kevin
Pritchard scored 10 points for Boston, another ex-Warriors guard, John Starks,
scored 30 for the New York Knicks.;   (check) Daniel Stubbs (remember him?)
has resurfaced with Sam Wyche's Cincinnati Bengals.;   (check) San Jose State
basketball coach Stan Morrison lost four players to a credit-card scam, but he
hasn't lost his sense of humor. In a newsletter to boosters, Morrison proposed
that "credit cards should be banned in San Jose for anyone over 6-feet tall
and under 25 years of age.";   (check) Send a prayer Magic's way -- and to the
countless others similarly afflicted.  </TEXT>
