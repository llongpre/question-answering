   DAYTON, Ohio -- Huffy Corp. Chairman Harry A. Shaw III,
crediting strong mountain bike sales, said he's comfortable
with analysts' estimates of fourth quarter earnings of 25
cents to 27 cents a share.
   In the 1990 fourth quarter, Huffy earned $1 million, or 12
cents a share, on sales of $121.4 million.

   Mr. Shaw said he also agrees with analysts who expect
Huffy to report 1991 earnings of as much as $1.41 a share. In
1990, the bicycle and consumer products company earned $18
million, or $1.28. He expects 1991 sales to come in at $675
million to $678 million, compared with $517 million in 1990.
   Moreover, Mr. Shaw expects the sales growth trend to
continue, with 1992 sales projected to reach between $725
million and $750 million.
   Mountain bike sales have driven much of Huffy's growth,
and now represent 60% of the company's total bicycle sales,
up from 10% four years ago. To maintain sales growth, the
company plans to unveil a new line of bicycles combining
heavy-duty features of mountain bicycles and standard
lighter-weight 10-speed touring bikes.
   "They're for somebody who's not riding a lot off-road,"
Mr. Shaw said. The new line will be priced in the $119-$200
range, while its current line of mountain bikes sell for
between $119 and $300. Huffy is planning a national
television advertising campaign to push the new line in April
and May.
   True Temper Hardware, which Huffy acquired from Black &amp;
Decker Corp. in November 1990, started 1991 "slowly" but had
a "terrific" fourth quarter and December, Mr. Shaw said.
Sales were especially strong in a new line of childrens'
garden tools and adult pruning tools, including shears and
clippers. Huffy expects the hardware subsidiary will have a
"very strong January and a very good first quarter."
   Less impressive were results in the company's inventory
counting subsidiary, Washington Inventory Service. The unit
has suffered management turnover in recent years, but has
stabilized under new leadership. "We're hoping the first
quarter will be an improvement over last year," Mr. Shaw
said. Its Huffy Service First unit lost a major customer,
representing 10% to 15% of the tiny unit's $1 million to $2
million annual earnings, when the customer decided to do its
own retail store displays and products. Still, Mr. Shaw
expects the unit to grow in 1992 as more retailers contract
out for display and product assemblage.
   Sales of basketball backboards grew last year, thanks to
the continuing popularity of the National Basketball
Association, whose name the company licenses, Mr. Shaw said.
A big seller was a stand-alone water-filled backboard system
for residential recreational use.
   Last fall, the company also introduced 25 juvenile
products, which helped boost sales of products such as car
seats, room monitors and baby carriers by 15%, Mr. Shaw said.
Huffy expects to introduce about as many new juvenile
products this year.
   Mr. Shaw said Huffy is in an active acquisition mode.
"We're looking for another consumer durable-product company
that's undermarketed, as we felt True Temper was." Of
particular interest to Huffy are companies, both domestic and
overseas, in the hardware, houseware, lawn and garden, and
juvenile products businesses.
