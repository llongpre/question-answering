<LEADPARA>  SATURDAY was the 100th anniversary of basketball's creation. On the afternoon
of Dec. 21, 1891, a physical education professor in Massachusetts named James
Naismith nailed a peach basket to a wall and bounced a soccer ball onto the
floor.;   And on the afternoon of Dec. 21, 1991, at Toso Pavilion, the
basketball teams of San Jose State and Santa Clara commemorated the event by
nailing each other with elbows -- and bouncing their torsos off the floor, the
basket supports, the bleachers and anything else that was handy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And San Jose State came from behind to score a ragged and rugged 61-60
victory.;   "The game is 100 years old today?" asked Spartans Coach Stan
Morrison afterward. "Well, we set it back 50 years.";   Not entirely true.
Saturday's game hardly was an outright dog. The drama was thick. Santa Clara
and San Jose State were two struggling teams, trying to find their stride
early in the season. The Broncos are still searching. At the final buzzer,
Santa Clara forward Rhea Taylor was lying flat on his back in agony, pounding
his fists on the hardwood after he missed the final shot. Meanwhile, San Jose
State's players hugged and yelped at center court.;   In short, it was like
the finish of thousands -- millions? -- of basketball games played over the
last century. It was why the game has lasted so long and become so much a part
of our sports landscape. Saturday was an occasion to toast all of that,
although Santa Clara was not in the mood. The Broncos, with all five starters
back from last season, are 2-6.;   "The 100th anniversary, huh?" said Carroll
Williams, Santa Clara's head coach, then added in sarcastic frustration: "It's
a great game, isn't it? A great game.";   The sport's centennial has not drawn
the attention here that it has in other places, because the Bay Area is
nowhere close to being a hoops hotbed, the Warriors' current exalted state
aside. Of the 25 largest college basketball arenas, none is located in
California. And only 1,425 spectators showed up for Saturday's game.;   But
that doesn't mean Saturday's historical moment should pass without mention.
Today, worldwide, basketball is more omnipresent than ever. And the recent
success of the women's teams at Stanford and Santa Clara indicates the sport
may be entering a whole new level of popularity.;   Yet it gives one pause.
What if Naismith hadn't been able to find a peach basket that fateful day in
1891? Or what if he'd slipped on the ice, broken his hip, and had never made
it to the gym? Would we now be spending the winter watching ESPN telecasts of
Big East croquet? Or curling?;    "I CAN'T imagine what the world would be
like without basketball," Morrison said. "In my view, it's right up there with
the invention of the wheel. Without basketball, I don't know what I would be
doing right now. I would probably be a teacher, I guess. Or an architect.";  
At least one of Saturday's players was pondering the same thoughts. As he
packed his duffel bag after the game, the Spartans' Terry Cannon proudly
pulled out a certificate that the American Basketball Congress has sent to
every college player this year, commemorating their appearance in the
centennial.;   "Basketball isn't just a sport for some people, it's a
lifestyle, a livelihood," said Cannon. "It's allowed me to receive an
education and allowed others to earn a living by teaching it.";   A major
cultural force, in other words. From small-town driveways, to big-city
playgrounds, to Toso Pavilion on a Saturday afternoon. Happy birthday, hoops.
You've earned the right to party.  </TEXT>
