<LEADPARA>  CONVICTED robber Ferdinand Reynolds, an inmate at Folsom State Prison, wrote
Sacramento police in October asking that they charge him with any unsolved
crimes still on the books. Wrote Reynolds, "I am trying to be the first man in
the history of America to ever get 5,000 years in prison, and I want you to
please help me out." He included a description of himself, with the words, "If
he (the suspect) looks like me then charge me for the crime."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  Brave new world;  (box) Among the inventions at the Monroeville Expo Mart near
Pittsburgh last year were golf shoes with technique pointers stitched across
the toes; a pre-knotted silk tie that slips on and off via a zipper; and, from
the Japanese inventor of the digital watch, a seaweed compound labeled as
"brain food" that supposedly guarantees clear thinking, and an engine run from
tap water that supposedly produces three times the power of a gasoline
engine.;    (box) An industry analyst says supermarket carts will soon be
equipped with 6-by 8-inch video monitors that will beam ads for nearby
products based on the customer's location in the store. And Texaco announced
last year that it would soon introduce video monitors at gas pumps, with a
capacity of about 10 messages per fill-up.;    (box) Young, fashion-conscious
Japanese men and women have been wearing replicas of the sheepskin flight
jackets worn by U.S. pilots during World War II, some complete with the
insignia of the squadron that bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.;    (box) Taking
the lead of a 7-Eleven owner in Victoria, British Columbia, several
convenience stores in the United States and Canada have tried playing
"elevator music" in their stores in an attempt to repel teen-agers who hang
out there.;    (box) In June, Taiwan's coast guard seized a smuggler's ship
filled with 30 tons of contraband rooster testicles and cow innards, destined
for the country's restaurants, whose owners say available testicles and
innards are too expensive.;    (box) Japan's Housing and Urban Development
Corp. announced recently that an apartment (819 square feet and a minute's
walk to a train station 30 minutes from downtown Tokyo) attracted a record
8,265 bids when it was placed on the market. It was expected to sell for more
than $300,000.; Be a sport;  (box) In June, Swedish golfer Mikael Krantz,
fresh from a drinking binge the night before, teed off in the third round of
the Irish Open, but his first swing caused him to lose his balance. He pitched
forward, dragging his caddy and a tournament official to the ground and
stunning spectators. He hit his second shot into an adjacent bay.;    (box)
Evergreen Foundation, an organization of "former" homosexuals and their
supporters, sponsored a conference last April on "curing" homosexuality
through sports. President Alan Seegmiller said participation in "traditional
masculine activities" such as basketball and softball would "heal the inner
child of the past." Seegmiller said some men, as an alternative, took training
as auto mechanics.;    (box) Marge Schott, owner of the world champion
Cincinnati Reds, said last year that she forces her team's manager, Lou
Piniella, to rub her pet Saint Bernard before each home game for good luck and
that for road games, she sends bags of the dog's hair to Piniella's hotel
room.;    (box) Among the participants in October's Asian Games were a
97-pound Chinese woman who can lift more than twice her weight in barbells; a
7-foot, 7-inch North Korean basketball player who has a full-time guide to
help prevent him from bumping his head; and six Iranian women who compete in
sharpshooting while covered from head to toe in their traditional black
robes.;    (box) South Korean officials were investigating more than 200
golfers who, during a massive regional cleanup effort after a September flood,
defied government admonitions and played golf, sometimes hitting shots while
standing alongside cleanup workers.  </TEXT>
