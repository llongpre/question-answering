MORNING BRIEFING: LASORDA HAS TALE FOR MOST EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Ferguson and the rest of the Dodger coaches were honored at a luncheon 
benefiting the Hollenbeck Youth Center Thursday, reminding some of a story 
Manager Tom Lasorda likes to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was catching for the Dodgers during a game at Dodger Stadium, Mickey 
Hatcher was playing third base and there was a runner on third with two out. 
Normally, if a grounder is hit to third in that situation, the play is to first 
for the easy out. 
</P>
<P>
"A grounder was hit to Hatcher, and I'm getting ready to watch his throw to 
first," Lasorda said. "If you're the catcher on the play, you run down to first 
to back up the throw. 
</P>
<P>
"So where does Hatcher throw the ball? He throws home. And the amazing thing is 
Fergie is there to make the play. 
</P>
<P>
"Hatcher comes off the field and I say, 'What the hell are you doing throwing 
home with two outs,' and he says, 'I thought there was one out.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then I turn to Ferguson and say, 'Why weren't you running to first to back up 
the throw?' 
</P>
<P>
"And Fergie says to me, 'When you play with dummies you have to think dumb.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who holds the NBA All-Star records for most field goals attempted 
and most field goals made in a single game. (Answer to follow.) 
</P>
<P>
A network executive was somewhat taken aback the other day when Harold 
Rossfields Smith, who served four years for embezzling $21.3 million from Wells 
Fargo Bank, called to pitch Olympic middleweight Roy Jones Jr., whom he said he 
was promoting. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he obtained a promoter's license, Smith said: "My problem wasn't 
boxing, it was banking." 
</P>
<P>
From Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, on schools who have said they 
voted yes on Proposal 42 by accident: 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't there anyone who voted for Proposal 42 on purpose? Maybe you ought to 
have to score 700 or higher on the SAT to qualify as a delegate to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. convention. Some of the delegates to this month's 
convention apparently could not spell cat if you gave them a three-letter head 
start." 
</P>
<P>
From Bob Smirzik of the Pittsburgh Press: "This is greed: About the same time 
his agent said no to a $2-million offer from the Boston Red Sox, pitcher Roger 
Clemens was charging $8.50 for an autograph in the Boston area. How much money 
to you need, Roger?" 
</P>
<P>
Talk about stretching for an angle. This comes from a CBS-TV press release: 
</P>
<P>
"Although George Washington and Abraham Lincoln weren't around when Dr. James 
Naismith invented the game of basketball in 1891, the former chief executives 
would undoubtedly have enjoyed watching two of the NBA's best teams battle on 
the day commemorating their births. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were alive and owned a television, they could do just that when 'The 
NBA on CBS' presents the Houston Rockets at the Cleveland Cavaliers, live on 
President's Day, Monday, Feb. 20." 
</P>
<P>
For the record: Pete Maravich did, indeed, score 66 points for LSU against 
Tulane on Feb. 10, 1969, and the score of the game was, indeed, 110-94, but it 
was Tulane that won, not LSU, as reported here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Rick Barry holds the record for most field goals attempted, 27 
in 1967, and Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan share the record for most 
field goals made, 17. Chamberlain got the record in 1962 and Jordan tied it 
last year.

Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
William Sanders, on why he wants his son Barry to bypass his senior year at 
Oklahoma State: "If he's going to play 11 games next year, he might as well 
play 16 and make some money."
