It's rough in Washington DC. The American football team is pathetic this
year, the basketball team cannot find the basket, nobody cares about the
toothless ice hockey club and we have not had a baseball team for nearly a
quarter of a century (we will not have a football team either if Jack Kent
Cooke, the owner, moves the Redskins to some racetrack in Maryland).
But we are not alone; it is rough all over the US. Although the college game
thrives, professional football has become boring, says no less an authority
than Sports Illustrated.
The best quarterbacks are ancient, such as Joe Montana, or injured, the
victims of the awful artificial turf. The air has gone out of basketball
with the retirement of Michael Jordan and it has been reduced to recruiting
Gheorge Muresan, a 7ft 7in Romanian with pituitary problems, and Shawn
Bradley, a former Mormon missionary an inch shorter, as if the embarrassing
performances of Manute Bol, a 7 ft 6 in ex-herdsman from Sudan, were not a
warning.
Baseball players are paid too much to play with any enthusiasm and the
talent is too diluted by expansion. Purists were appalled by, though
strangely drawn to, the ineptitude that characterised much of the last World
Series. Ice hockey is so desperate for fans that it is being played near
Disneyland, light years from its frozen northern home, by a team called the
Mighty Ducks.
The only golfer of interest is John Daly and mostly for what he does off the
course. Juvenile tennis stars burn out with monotonous regularity. No wonder
the US is becoming addicted to the virtual reality of video games.
It is tempting to conclude that soccer, coming here in the shape of the
World Cup next year, is pushing on an open door. Millions of children, girls
included, play it because it is cheap and safe. There may be no professional
game played outdoors but college soccer is starting to resemble the real
thing.
There is a young man from New Jersey, Claudio Reyna, the University of
Virginia's midfield player, who is coveted by the wealthy clubs of Italy and
Spain. When the US national side beat England last June it made the front
page of the sports sections with lots of funny headlines. There is already a
black market for tickets for all the World Cup games and about one-fifth of
them are going to appear on national television.
Such temptations should be resisted. Soccer will get a boost from the World
Cup but it must be at least a generation away from establishing itself as a
'major' sport in the US. There are lots of sober reasons for this view,
including lack of money and the problems of adapting a sport with no
artificial break other than half-time to a television system so dependent on
commercial breaks that an American football game of one hour's actual
playing time typically lasts three hours. But these are only half the
problem.
The first is size. Thighs and long hair apart, there is nothing physically
distinguishing about soccer players. They may be marvellous athletes in
their own right, but they look - well, ordinary, and Americans like to
associate themselves with the extraordinary.
Football features 300 lbs linemen capable of running down ball carriers
barely two-thirds the weight. People flock to watch Daly hit a ball further
than any successful golfer has.
The American sports fan might like to think that he, sometimes she, can
emulate their feats. So they buy jumbo drivers and once in a blue moon the
taller ones succeed in slamdunking a basketball into the net in their
driveways or throw perfect spirals in a touch football pick-up game. But it
is all a dream, whereas soccer, played by ordinary looking people, is closer
to gritty reality, from which sports are supposed to provide an escape.
Then there is the statistical problem, which runs far beyond the fact that
there are not enough goals in soccer. Americans prefer sports with high
scores, which is why the 16-14 World Series victory by Toronto over
Philadelphia was so compelling. Americans are consumed by the numbers which
lie behind the final score, as even a glance at any US newspaper's sports
page attests. Assists, tackles, errors, yards, balls, catches, pitches,
averages, blocked shots, turnovers, saves, minutes played and much more
besides are all minutely catalogued.
Soccer can provide only a fraction of this numerical diet, which not only
forms the stuff of every sports talk show and post-game office conversation
but serves as a measurement by which players may reasonably fairly be
compared, even over generations.
All that is left of Bobby Charlton are fond memories and flickering
black-and-white film, but Ty Cobb, who played in the first 20 years of this
century, is still there in baseball's statistical compendium.
Player image also does not seem to work in soccer's favour. There is a
debate among US professional sportsmen over whether or not they should serve
as role models. Charles Barkley, who plays basketball for the Phoenix Suns
with unreserved passion, rejects this imposition and Jordan's well known
gambling flouted it.
But it is a burden mostly accepted by the stars, even to the point of
mind-numbing blandness in, for example, golf (broken only when some of the
Ryder Cup team complained about having to meet Bill Clinton because he had
just increased taxes on their vast incomes). Most sports have severe
sanctions for those who transgress off the field by use of drugs or alcohol.
Soccer, on the other hand, seems stuffed with renegades, roustabouts and
lawbreakers, at least according to the European tabloid press. Maradona,
easily the best known player coming to the US for the World Cup, would
definitely be on a suspended list if he were playing here.
The final problem for soccer is that US sports are never static and always
respond to even the hint of discontent. When pitchers became too dominant in
the 1960s, baseball made it harder for them by lowering the height of the
mound. Football is forever tinkering with its rules to make life safer for
the quarterback and easier for the wide receiver, basketball introduced the
three-point shot and the time clock and ice hockey cracked down on fighting
(a mistake since a good brawl was always as much of an attraction as the
artistry of Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.) Soccer's comparable options seem
more limited.
And there are always great players in the pipeline to revive interest.
Baseball has a clutch of budding stars in their mid-20s, basketball can
replace Jordan with Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning and Shawn Kemp, Troy
Aikman-to-Michael Irvine can supplant Montana-to-Jerry Rice who supplanted
Terry Bradshaw-to-Lynn Swann, Eric Lindros supplanted Gretzky and so on.
Here in DC, we will go to RFK stadium to catch, if we can find a scalper,
whoever the World Cup draw gives us and we will expect to be entertained,
even by Saudi Arabia. But - seriously - we will still be more interested to
see if the decline of the once-great 'Skins is reversible or if, 40 miles
down the road, Rafael Palmeiro, the new Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.1m) first
baseman, can bring a pennant to the Baltimore Orioles.
After all, to paraphrase a great politician, all sport is local and soccer
merely a world sport.
