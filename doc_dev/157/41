<LEADPARA>  If you are open, Magic will get you the ball. He may not be looking your way,
but that is no problem. He will throw the ball over his shoulder or between
his legs -- while he is running full speed in the other direction. He will
strut and fake and preen and, the next thing you know, you are making an
uncontested 10-foot jumper or stuffing the ball through the basket.; Chicago

JOHNSON HELPED SAVE THE NBA  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The End of the Magic Era  </MEMO>
<TEXT>   There is a select group of players who revolutionized James Naismith's game
of basketball. George Mikan and Wilt Chamberlain brought size. Bob Cousy and
Oscar Robertson brought passing. Bill Russell brought defense. Julius Erving,
Earl Monroe and Pete Maravich brought impossible moves.;   Then there was
Magic.;   Earvin Johnson Jr. brought as much to the game as anyone, if not
more. He was a 6-foot-9 point guard, a fact that never lost its significance
right up until the moment he sadly retired Thursday because he had tested
positive for the AIDS virus.;   Magic, so nicknamed because of a 36-point,
18-rebound, 16-assist performance during a high school game, brought more
assists than anyone. He brought championships to every level of competition,
including five to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s. He brought
irrepressible ebullience and charisma to the game. He and Larry Bird -- and
any mention of Magic would not be complete without mention of his longtime
rival -- brought the NBA out of dark days.;   Magical contribution;   "The
only thing you can really say about Magic Johnson is that he revolutionized
the game -- period," said Dallas Mavericks veteran guard Rolando Blackman,
among those shocked by the news. "He came in being able to pass the
basketball, able to defuse every team and bring team camaraderie and
enthusiasm to the game when it was getting dark in those times. It was
tremendous what he did for this game.";   The word "did" seems as
incomprehensible as Magic's no-look passes to Byron Scott or James Worthy.
Johnson may have been descending ever-slightly at 32, but he had won three of
the last four NBA MVP awards before Michael Jordan won the last one. Johnson
still made life miserable for opposing coaches, who tried traps and presses
and rotating defenses but never really figured out how to handle a 6-9 point
guard.;   There was no Next Magic;   Every so often, an NBA scout would take a
look at a college standout and pronounce, "He's the next Magic." But there
never was a Next Magic. Sean Elliott has not turned out to be the Next Magic.
No one has.;   As he was about to begin his pro career in 1979, Johnson was
asked how he had become a guard. He replied:;   "It began in seventh grade,
when I started in the backcourt because we had a lot of tall people but I had
to play somewhere because I was leading the team in scoring. I played forward
in eighth and ninth grades, forward in 10th, center in 11th and all three
positions in my senior year when we (Lansing Evert High School) won the
(Michigan) state championship. I would jump center, play forward if we were
running our man-to-man offense and play guard against zones because I could
pass the ball over the defense.;   "Is it fair to be such a tall guard? It's
fair if you can play the position.";   Unforgettable performance;   Johnson
showed as a rookie that he could play any position, filling in unforgettably
at center for the injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in Game 6 of the finals, leading
the Lakers to the title and winning the series MVP award. That versatility was
a key in the Lakers' run during the '80s, but the lasting image is that of
Johnson leading the Showtime fastbreak, faking one way and dishing the other
way for a jam.;   "On the court, he's the magic man, the candy man," former
Lakers Coach Paul Westhead once observed. "He throws the ball behind his back,
waves to the girls, has fun. But he's also a thug, banging into the boards,
knocking people over. Maybe that's why he's Magic. Because now you see him,
now you don't.";   Now you don't.;   He'll miss the Olympics;   There no
longer will be that trepidation by teams entering the Forum. Although trivial
in light of his condition, there will be no Johnson in the 1992 Summer
Olympics. That was going to be his crowning glory; he had done everything else
that mattered -- won, revolutionized a game, saved a league.;   "Before (Bird)
and I came into the league," Johnson said after being named to the Olympic
team, "it was an 'I' league in terms of guys looking to score and not worrying
about passing. Larry and I brought that element to the game. And that brought
the fans back, the excitement back."  </TEXT>
