   Two inventors have crafted their own Santa's
workshop in a Fort Worth suburb, breaking into the tough toy
industry while helping others do the same.
   After running into closed doors at several leading toy
companies, Gary Blankenship and Dorian Sandlin formed a merry, if
loose-knit, band of toymakers who are developing their own
products.
   ``We try not to let the everyday drudgery of business,
bookkeeping bring us down on our creativity. The main thing here is
to have fun and create,'' Sandlin said.
   Blankenship, 34, and Sandlin, 39, started talking toys when they
met in church two years ago. Blankenship asked Sandlin, a
commercial artist, to design a package for a stuffed dog he'd
created.
   Sandlin then started pitching toy ideas of his own and last year
they formed Yapco Toy Co., named for that first stuffed dog, Yappie
the Yuppie Pup.
   The pair, who now operate out of a small office in Bedford,
first achieved success with KidsFlex, which hospitals have
purchased to help develop the eye-hand coordination of therapy
patients.
   The toy is a crescent-shaped tube filled with water and a rubber
ball. Grips at both ends of the tube are squeezed to move the ball
from one side to the other.
   The toy is the lead product for Yapco, which is projecting more
than $1.5 million in sales next year. Blankenship and Sandlin said
they are negotiating with a Japanese company to distribute KidsFlex
there.
   To finance more creations, Blankenship and Sandlin started
helping other inventors launch theirs. This year, they created
Toyquest Inc. to provide other toy creators advice and help with
packaging, patenting and making a prototype.
   Toyquest can develop simple toys, like card games, for as little
as $5,000, Sandlin said. More sophisticated toys, such as
electronics items, may take an investment 10 times that size.
Initial inquiries are free.
   ``We found ourselves in a situation where we go to toy companies
with an idea and they'd basically laugh you right out,'' Sandlin
said.
   ``We saw a market out there, friends of ours who had ideas, good
ideas from good people out there. That's what we wanted to tap into
and hopefully make part of the Yapco line. That would help us and
help them, too.''
   Inventors have the option of joining Yapco's toy line, and many
have. Blankenship and Sandlin and more than 30 of their clients
will unveil abot 50 products at the New York Toy Fair, the
industry's showcase event, in February.
   ``It's pretty exciting once you've had an idea and you see it
being exhibited in one of these shows. It's pretty spectacular,''
Blankenship said.
   ``Gary and Dorian really bring a quality agenda with Toyquest,''
said Dale Brandon, a Cleveland-based toy consultant. ``There's
plenty of room for champions to come along in this industry.''
   Brandon, who founded a specialized toy retail chain, is one of
26 people whom Blankenship and Sandlin turned to for advice and
guidance. He believes the toy industry has suffered by squeezing
out creative inventors such as them.
   ``We're still propped up by Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles and
sedentary video games,'' Brandon said.
   About 30 percent of the sales by toy giant Mattel Inc. are items
that come from idea submissions outside of the company, said Mattel
spokeswoman Donna Gibbs in Los Angeles.
   Mattel's Magic Nursery doll was an inventor's idea and has
become one of the company's top-selling items this holiday, Ms.
Gibbs said.
   ``There's a stable of inventors that we stay pretty much in
constant contact with,'' Ms. Gibbs said. Those inventors usually
have previous experience in the toy industry, though, she said.
   In addition to Yappie and KidsFlex, Yapco has developed a series
of stuffed cats built around Cruising Charlie, who looks like a
gaudy tourist, several educational products, some board games and a
few gag items.
   Yapco already sells some of the items in specialty stores in
California and Texas.
