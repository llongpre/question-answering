<LEADPARA>  Q  In June I ordered four Skybox Inaugural Commemorative Tins to hold
basketball trading cards. They were advertised on the back of Skybox trading
cards. Well, Skybox cashed my two $5 checks and has yet to send my tins. The
advertisement had said the orders would take six to eight weeks. I wrote at
the end of August and received a reply that it would be another six to eight
weeks. Now I'm beginning to wonder if it's a scam.;   -- Terry S. McAdams,

<TEXT>  A  No, just poor planning. USA Fulfillment, the company responsible for
filling those orders, was unprepared for the response to the basketball card
tins, and the inventory was depleted before all the orders could be filled,
says spokeswoman Shirley W. Moore. She says consumers were sent two post
cards, one advising them of the delay and another offering them the option of
canceling. Regardless, your tins have now been shipped, and Moore apologizes
for your frustration.;   Reaching black television; Q  I would like the
address for Black Entertainment Television.;   -- Calvin Smith, Campbell; A 
The cable network has two listings. If your concern is with corporate
operations, write Black Entertainment Television -- or BET -- at 1232 31st St.
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007. If you want to comment or inquire about
programming, direct your letter to the BET studios at 1899 Ninth St. N.E.,
Washington, D.C. 20018.;   Sew be it; Q  I need help finding a Koyo Sewing
Machine Company. I have a Koyo Sewing machine and cannot find bobbins for it.
It is useless without them. Is this company still in business?;   -- Susan
Lasker, Los Gatos; A  American Koyo Co. is still in business in Ohio, but the
firm stopped manufacturing sewing machines in the late 1970s. The company
refers consumers to Case Sewing Center, 860 Center St., Ashtabula, Ohio 44004,
(216) 998-1213, for accessories, parts and repairs. A Case employee says many
Koyo machines take standard bobbins, available at fabric and sewing stores.
However, if your machine is rotary and doesn't take standard bobbins, Case can
supply you with replacements.;    Tip: Baking help; D  one with the turkey but
panicky about baking for the holidays ahead? For the second year in a row,
Land O'Lakes is operating its toll-free Holiday Baking Hotline to help with
baking cookies and candies from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. PST through Dec. 22: (800)
782-9606.;   Setting the record straight; Q  Because of a reporter's error,
the toll-free phone number run Nov. 12 for the Foundation Study of Cycles in
Irvine was incorrect. The correct number is (800) 477-0741.  </TEXT>
