<LEADPARA>  There simply are not enough superlatives to describe the wonderful, fantastic,
incredibly awesome basketball launcher invented by 9-year-old Taylor Holmes.; 
  With 10 springs and a little thread, Taylor turned an ordinary pair of
gloves into a launcher extraordinaire. The third-grader swears he gets an
extra six inches or a foot on every throw.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I have a friend who was kind of getting mad at himself because he couldn't
get the ball to go through the hoop with a regular basketball, so I thought
maybe the gloves would help," said Taylor.;    "And it works.";    Taylor, a
student at Camino Pablo Elementary School, unveiled his top-secret invention
Thursday during his class's annual Invention Convention.;    For the third
consecutive year, students in Marlene Thier's class have come up with a
dazzling array of new devices.;    There's the automatic pet scratcher, the
automatic room picker-upper, the automatic trash taker-outer and the PetAway
security system that comes complete with motion sensors and timers that
trigger sprinklers to soak trespassing pets.;    Thier's 25 students are part
of a group of 10,000 students nationwide competing in the Invent America
Program sponsored by the U.S. Patent Model Foundation. After a team of
Lawrence Hall of Science judges selects the best of the lot, Thier hopes her
winning student will get to compete with national winners in Washington.;   
There were also many water-saving devices in this fifth year of drought. The
Shower Timer measures water as it's used to let a bather know when 20 gallons
have gone down the drain. The Rain Keeper is a giant plastic canopy that
catches rain water. Wash and Flush sends drain water from the sink into the
toilet, where it's used for flushing.;    But pets were a strong theme.;   
Amanda Malmquist created the pet scratcher, mounting a pasta fork on a box
over a little battery-run motor. The flick of a switch starts the motor
whirring and the fork moving back and forth.;    "My grandma has a dog, and my
hand gets so tired scratching its back," said Amanda as she demonstrated her
device on a stuffed rabbit.;    Jason Chiu had a mission when he set out to
create PetAway: no more strays wandering through the yard.;    His elaborate
security device uses motion sensors and timers that trigger sprinklers. Best
of all, wayward dogs set off a taped recording of a roaring lion.;    There's
only one hitch.;    The device can't tell the difference between a letter
carrier and a poodle.  </TEXT>
