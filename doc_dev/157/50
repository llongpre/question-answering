   The stinky inspiration for Sneaker Balls came to
entrepreneur Dennis Green two years ago after his wife complained
about an aroma in his car.
   ``She said she borrowed my car and it sure smelled bad. She said
it was the gym bag in the back seat,'' said Green, an athletic
45-year-old who plays basketball regularly.
   ``It just hit me all of a sudden _ there's a product there. Not
something to freshen the car, but to freshen the bag so it wouldn't
smell the car up,'' he said.
   That brainstorm spawned Sneaker Balls _ fragrance discs encased
in colorful pingpong-size balls made of recycled plastic soft drink
bottles. Green's invention is designed to cut the odor of moldy gym
bags, rancid tennis shoes and sweaty lockers for up to three months.
   Each Sneaker Ball exudes a fragrance and an odor-blocker, which
floods the olfactory receptors of the brain so they cannot smell
sweat, Green says. The chemicals are released by twisting the balls
to open slots cut into the sides.
   According to their motto, Sneaker Balls have ``The Courage To Go
Where The Ugly Stuff Grows.''
   It sounds like a funny idea, but since Sneaker Balls hit the
market in July 1988, Green's company, Dennis Green Design Group
Ltd, has sold 1.5 million at $2.50 to $4 apiece. A new Sneaker Ball
design will debut later this year, and the back orders already
total 5 million.
   Green's business comes from most of the big U.S. discount store
chains and athletic footwear retailers and from stores in Canada,
Mexico, Europe and Asia.
   But Green isn't in the factory all day, supervising production _
he's at home, writing fiction.
   ``I have one philosophy in business, and that is that I want to
write books, and if I have employees I can't very well do that,''
he said.
   For that reason, Green has subcontracted the entire Sneaker
Balls manufacturing and distribution operation to a Loveland, Colo.
company called New Systems Molding.
   About 50 employees at the New Systems plant work
around-the-clock, molding Sneaker Balls and assembling them. Green
expects the work force to double within six months.
   Green is a trained architect who grew bored with his profession
and began designing and selling his own line of greeting cards.
Within five years, Green and his wife were designing and selling
greeting cards across the United States and in 24 other countries.
   In 1981, they sold the business so Green could write, but the
new owners went bankrupt three years later, Green's income stopped
and he went back to designing and selling cards _ until his wife's
complaint gave him the idea for Sneaker Balls.
   Green said it took a year to make a prototype of Sneaker Balls
that he could display to potential investors.
   ``I began doing research. I didn't know anything about
fragrances or plastics either,'' he said. ``I made the prototype by
stuffing fragrance in cotton balls because I didn't know anything
about fragrance discs. I put them in my bag when I worked out. I
put them in my shoes when I wasn't working out.''
   In a locker room one day, someone noticed Green's Sneaker Balls
and asked him about them. The man, who was a broker, signed an
option agreement with Green that led to a contract with an investor
group.
   But that was a false start _ the investors made the first
payment, but not the next two. Green took Sneaker Balls to a trade
show and immediately found a distributor who got him a contract
with K mart Corp.
   Four months later, in July 1988, he began shipping Sneaker Balls
to customers.
   Now Green spends his mornings writing fiction, and his
afternoons attending to business and playing basketball, a
carryover from his days at Boise State College in Idaho, where he
was a starting forward.
   And, as business booms, he's also finished his first novel:
``Double Bind,'' a psychological thriller about a Washington
journalist.
