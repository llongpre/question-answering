262 pp., $35;  ON JAN. 1, 1965, I watched on television as Tommy Nobis and the
Texas Longhorn defense "screwed their navels to the ground," as their colorful
down-home coach, Darrell Royal, would say later, in a fourth-quarter,
goal-line stand that preserved a 21-17 victory over Joe Namath and the Alabama
Crimson Tide in the Orange Bowl. The 'Horns had hooked me. Although I was not
yet out of junior high school in a small East Texas town, I decided that night
that I someday would attend the University of Texas.;    Some time after
arriving in Austin, I got my priorities straight, or at least straighter,
which is more than can be said for the university in respect to its sports,
particularly football. Not only did the average students at Texas not share
the collegiate experience with the football players, we rarely even saw them
outside Memorial Stadium on fall Saturdays.;    Our Longhorns at least lived
in the vicinity of other students, but the players had their own floors, their
own cafeteria and, presumably, their own food fights.;    Their classes
usually had in common professors who were friendly to the athletic department
and gave players grades necessary to maintain their eligibility. Too often, it
seemed as if there were no more connection between academics and football than
there is between the Red River and the Red Sea.;    Later, as my sportswriting
career bounced me around, I discovered what I had cynically suspected as an
undergraduate: The situation at Texas was not an exception but the rule among
our nation's football factories.;    So as I watched the Longhorns play the
Miami Hurricanes Jan. 1 in the Cotton Bowl, I was fully aware that what I was
seeing in that game, as well as in the other post-season bowl games, was
semi-pro football.;    Unfortunately, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, which governs major-college sports, and the news media have
concentrated in recent years on what illegal inducements the players in
revenue-producing sports such as football and basketball are getting --
under-the-table payments, cars, cushy summer jobs, T-shirts -- instead of what
they're not getting: educations.;    Fortunately, the publishing houses have
not ignored this fraud, as evidenced most recently by the publication of two
books -- Francis X. Dealy Jr.'s "Win at Any Cost" and Murray Sperber's
"College Sports Inc..";    As Dealy discovered, this is hardly a new
phenomenon. In 1898, Brown University called together representatives from the
elite Eastern universities that now form the Ivy League, which played
higher-quality football than any professional football league that existed at
the time, to discuss the role of athletics on campuses.;    The subsequent
Brown Conference report suggested a number of reforms, including one that
would allow teams to use only players who were in good academic standing. But
the report was largely ignored. Unwilling to disarm unilaterally, Harvard
refused to accept any limitations that were not adopted by Yale. Yale -- whose
coach, Walter Camp, practically invented football as we know it today -- did
not even send a representative to the conference.;    The Ivy League
eventually reformed, but it is an island among major athletic conferences. The
precedent for big-time college sports was established. As Dealy and Sperber
conclude, it is less accurate today to refer to student-athletes than to
athlete-students. In some cases, even that is too charitable.;    For
instance, both Dealy and Sperber write about Andrew Gaze, a basketball
sharpshooter who enrolled at Seton Hall at age 23 in October 1988. Gaze played
for one season, during which the Pirates advanced to the NCAA finals in March
1989; then he returned home to Australia to play professionally.
Student-athlete? Try mercenary.;    I was surprised by some of the myths
exposed by Sperber regarding the business of athletic departments. It is
difficult after reading these books to conclude that big-time college sports
is anything other than a lie.;    But it is a third book, "Backboards &amp;
Blackboards," that proves most enlightening because it is written from inside
a major college's athletic department.;    Sociologists Patricia and Peter
Adler concentrated on the basketball program at Tulsa University, although
their book also drew from experiences with five universities in three cities
over 10 years. As academic counselor to the basketball players at Tulsa in the
early 1980s, Peter Adler had access to what he calls the team's "black box."; 
  As expected from an academic project, the Adlers conducted their research
scientifically and, by all appearances, objectively. They not only liked and
respected the head basketball coach, Nolan Richardson (who since has moved to
Arkansas), they dedicated the book to him. Yet it is their book, oddly enough,
that is the most damning of college athletics.;    From the Adlers'
observations, it is apparent that things did not change much in the decade
after I left Texas. There was little effort at Tulsa to integrate the mostly
black basketball players into the overwhelmingly white student body, as they
were restricted to an athletic dorm that the Adlers described as a "ghetto."
Their day-to-day existence was so different from that of average students that
most players did not even feel comfortable socializing with non-athletes. The
athletes felt isolated, seeing themselves not as students but as
"quasi-employees" of the university.;    That is a small price to pay for an
education; unfortunately, too many athletes in the major sports do not receive
one. While NCAA statistics show that athletes in general graduate at about the
same rate as non-athletes, athletes in the revenue-producing sports --
football and basketball -- for major-college programs do not fare nearly as
well in classrooms. The graduation rates for black athletes in big-time
college sports are so depressingly low -- 26.1 percent in football and 17.1
percent in basketball -- that University of California, Berkeley, sociologist
Harry Edwards refers to them as "black gladiators.";    The Adlers concluded
that some of the basketball players at Tulsa were victimized, but they also
viewed Richardson as a victim of a high-pressure, win-or-be-gone system. They
portrayed him as a conscientious man who put a premium on education while
recruiting athletes but, in the heat of a season, allowed his commitment to
slide.;    In a much-publicized 1988 court case recounted in Dealy's book,
Ronnie Harmon, a former running back for the University of Iowa, testified
that he failed to graduate because the athletic department's academic
counselor allowed the athlete to take simple courses unrelated to his major so
that he could remain eligible to play football. Among his courses were
watercolor painting, billiards, slow-pitch softball, recreational leisure and
ancient athletics.;    Harmon was lucky. He has succeeded in professional
football. But of major-college football and basketball players, only about 1
percent reap the fame and fortune of professional sports.  </TEXT>
