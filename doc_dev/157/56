   When American and Japanese children got
together Tuesday to compare prize-winning inventions, one side
brought most of the frivolous, fanciful toys while the other
displayed no-nonsense solutions to everyday problems.
   But in a reversal of stereotypes, it was the Japanese kids who
brought the marionette and robot on skis, and the Americans who
produced door guards, portable seat belts and diapers with built-in
disposable bags.
   The meeting was arranged by a program to spur creativity among
American students called ``Invent America!'' and the Japan
Institution of Invention and Innovation, which has sponsored
competitions for Japanese schoolchildren since 1941.
   The Japanese students' inventions included the mechanized
marionette of Takakiyo Katami, 11, of Gufu City; a robot that can
slalom back and forth on skis by Yasushi Nishiyama, 15, of Nagoya;
and an illuminated constellation model made from 2,000 optical
fibers by Takahiro Tsurita, 14, of Toyota City.
   Tomoyuki Imura, 15, of Miki City, Japan, came up with a ball
retriever that consists of several tennis cans open at both ends
and taped together.
   Sally Mallison, 12, of Wilmington, Del., who devised her
``Bag-A-Diap'' to help her parents cope with messy diapers on car
trips, said, ``I think from the Japanese I've learned that
inventions can be mechanical and they can also be ... like mine
where they don't have anything mechanical to do with them.''
   Yasushi Nishiyama, maker of the slalom robot, said through an
interpreter, ``After observing all these inventions I notice
Japanese students' inventions seem to be more like toys, something
kids can play with.''
   Most of the Americans' inventions, he added, seemed ``more
practical, something in your daily life that you can actually use.''
   How does that square with the image Americans have of Japanese
students spending endless hours in school or studying?
   ``There are some people who study hard, but there are some who
just enjoy playing,'' Nishiyama said. ``They stay away from that
work. Instead, they try to create something more interesting so
they can enjoy themselves.''
   Two of the young Japanese inventors' devices did have a
practical tilt. Hiroshi Aoyagi, 12, of Tokamachi, built a door that
can slide up or swing out.
   And Yoshitaka Tanimoto, 13, of Takayama City, won top honors,
the Prime Minister's Prize, for inventing a device to help his
grandfather regain use of his hand after a stroke. Tanimoto's hand
rehabilitation machine consists of two crescent shaped handles
attached by strong rubber bands that can be stretched apart.
   The Americans, all honored last June in an Invent America
competition, included Maurice Scales, 8, of Suitland, Md., who came
up with a Plexiglas shield to keep doors from slamming on his
sister's fingers; the portable seat belt for school buses by
Michelle Cardin, 10, of Fairfield, Conn.; an artificial reef to
help young fish by Brian Lloyd, 15, of Jacksonville, Fla.; and a
scheme for solar energy from space by Sachin Patel, 7, of Flatonia,
Texas.
   The U.S. Patent Model Foundation launched Invent America in
December 1986 with corporate financing and moral support from the
Reagan administration. It expects 8 million students in 35,000 U.S.
elementary schools to take part in this year's competition.
   Kazuhiko Hoshino, president of the Japan Institute of Invention
and Innovation, said the visit will help the Japanese youths
``develop new ideas and high creativity.''
   ``In order to cope with the current trend toward
internationalization, we consider it important for Japanese school
students to visit overseas at every opportunity,'' he said.
