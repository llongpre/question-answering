EVEN A BERTH IN THE WORLD CUP CAN'T PUT U.S. ON A SOCCER KICK

If he lived in almost any other country, Paul Caligiuri wouldn't have to buy a 
beer for the rest of his life. The bartender would always beat him to it. 
</P>
<P>
Caligiuri is a soccer player from Diamond Bar, and Sunday he scored a goal that 
put his country in the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. Such a feat 
would make him a sporting legend in almost any country except the one where he 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
That is the United States, and even though his left-footed shot made soccer 
history, most Americans still don't know his name. Soccer may cause riots 
elsewhere and stir more passion than any other game in the world, but most 
Americans prefer not to watch unless their kids are playing. 
</P>
<P>
In Trinidad, where Caligiuri scored his goal and ruined the home team's hopes 
of becoming the smallest country to play in the Cup, the game was treated as an 
epochal event. A national holiday was declared. Fans filled the stadium hours 
before kickoff. Such reaction is a worldwide tradition. 
</P>
<P>
There was less excitement in the States -- almost none, to be specific. The 
game was televised on tape and cable, opposite pro football, no doubt to a 
small audience. The victory did not result in network bulletins, as it did in 
Italy, where the Cup will be played next summer. Had the game been in the 
United States, it probably would not have drawn 20,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Caligiuri's goal should help matters. Playing in the Cup will raise the soccer 
consciousness of the American public, and the United States is now assured of 
playing in the next two; the Cup will be played in the United States in 1994, 
and the home team automatically qualifies. There will be no problem finding 
sponsors, a concern that might have forced the national team to disband 
temporarily had it not won Sunday and qualified for Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The hardy souls still trying to sell the game here will, surely, pronounce the 
victory as the start of something big. They do have reason to be excited. 
Staging a World Cup in the United States will focus tremendous attention on 
their game. They could attract millions of fans. 
</P>
<P>
It is debatable how high the public's soccer consciousness can go, however. The 
sport has been stuck at a curious station in America for some time now: 
Millions of kids are playing, but no one wants to pay to watch pros. This quirk 
has existed for so long that it is beginning to seem permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Youth soccer has grown exponentially in the last 20 years, all but rubbing out 
football as a game for youngsters. The reasons are obvious. It's relatively 
safe, it's good exercise, and everyone gets to kick the ball. But this 
popularity hasn't spawned a ticket-buying public. The one league that had some 
success, the North American Soccer League, folded. An indoor league remains 
viable on a small scale. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional explanation for this failure is that there is little scoring in 
soccer, and Americans are an impatient lot who become bored unless bells are 
ringing and the score is changing every two minutes. There may be something to 
that, although personally I'm a little insulted. 
</P>
<P>
To me, a better reason is that Americans don't understand the game, having no 
background in it. Plus, there is no room on the sporting landscape here. 
Football, baseball, basketball, hockey -- is there room in that glut for 
another major sport? No, particularly when Americans invest only in ones they 
invent. (Hockey is the only exception.) 
</P>
<P>
If there is any chance for soccer to become popular, it will come when the kids 
weaned on it grow up and have soccer-playing kids of their own, creating 
families where it is the No. 1 sport. By then, the 1994 Cup will have created 
more fans, and there should be enough competent American players to fill a 
credible league. It might work. 
</P>
<P>
It probably won't, though. There just aren't enough interested souls. Try as I 
might, for I find the sport and its culture fascinating, it is difficult to 
envision soccer as anything other than a cult in the United States. That is 
unfortunate, for the United States has made enormous strides in the last 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It is true the Americans probably would not have qualified for Italy had Mexico 
not been banned for falsifying the ages of junior players and Canada not been 
upset in earlier qualifying. And, even then, the United States barely made it, 
struggling in important games against such countries as El Salvador and 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
That sounds embarrassing, but isn't when one considers that, only 20 years ago, 
the United States could not have stayed within a half-dozen goals of the worst 
of those teams. Populations were irrelevant. Soccer had no structure in the 
United States. Almost no one played. The national team had played in the World 
Cup in 1950 only because it had been invited. It never could have qualified. 
</P>
<P>
In that larger framework, the victory in Trinidad is significant and symbolic. 
The United States will get beaten in Italy, but it is now a legitimate player 
in the international game and, with its army of youngsters kicking endlessly, 
will improve. Any successes will continue to be celebrated only by a small band 
of believers, however. Too bad.
