   This riot-weary city kicked off a festive Super Bowl
weekend today, and police said a peaceful professional basketball
game just blocks from the center of the week's violence showed that
calm had been restored.
   Officials reported occasional gunfire and minor rock and bottle
throwing Thursday night, although one gang of a dozen Overtown
youths reportedly beat three people. Twelve riot-related arrests
were made, and police said they have resumed normal patrols.
   ``Everything's quiet,'' police spokesman David Rivero said this
morning. ``We still have the perimeter up, but we're letting
everyone through. The officers are just standing by the
barricades.'' All highway exits into Overtown that had been closed
during the disturbance were open today, he said.
   Thursday night, about 100 officers formed a barrier between the
Overtown area and Miami Arena, where the Chicago Bulls defeated the
hometown Heat in a National Basketball Association game. Some 13,000
fans attended the game, with no reports of trouble. Tuesday night's
game against Phoenix was canceled because of the violence.
   ``The game definitely shows things are under control,'' said
police spokesman Armando Villorin. ``It was a test, and we feel
great about it.''
   ``We're grateful that the focus has returned to the Super Bowl,''
said police spokesman Ray Lang.
   Raymond Scales, a high school counselor at the game, said it took
him only a half-hour to sell 25 T-shirts that read ``I survived
Miami 1989. It was a riot.'' Fans snapped up the shirts at $10
apiece.
   The fire department estimated damage to buildings from three days
of rioting at less than $1 million, although shopkeepers digging out
Thursday said their greatest losses were in inventory and equipment
that was looted or destroyed.
   The rage touched off by a Hispanic police officer's shooting of
an unarmed black motorcyclist Monday left one man dead, seven others
shot and some 370 people jailed _ most of them suspected looters
under 18, police said. More than 100 had criminal records, including
17 murders and 198 drug offenses.
   Some remained in jail pending the posting of bonds, and that
helped maintain the quiet, Miami police Sgt. Michael Mazur said.
   For Miami, Sunday's Super Bowl really begins today with an
onslaught of parties and performances, fireworks and frivolity.
Nearly 75,000 fans are expected at the championship football game
between the Cincinnati Bengals and the San Francisco 49ers.
   Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Sammy Davis Jr., Robin Williams,
Kenny G, Marvin Hamlisch and the Vienna Choir Boys headline the
events. Two huge parties are planned, free to city residents.
   Police continued to control access to the largely black Overtown
area, but within the neighborhood, businesses lifted their shutters,
children attended school and youngsters played pick-up basketball.
   As the dust settled, business owners and a black community
activist said it was clear black-owned businesses were spared and
others were specifically targeted during three nights of rioting.
   The rioters were not just youths running wild in the night but
people who picked their targets carefully, they said, sometimes even
choosing to ransack a store and destroy its cash registers and
scales but leave behind large stocks of beer, wine and food.
   ``Everything was planned and targeted: Protect black businesses
and get the white man, the Hispanic and the Arab out of our
community,'' said black community activist Georgia Ayers.
   ``They were not hungry. They just wanted to destroy,'' said Sam
Bahhur, whose Palestinian family operated seven small food markets
in Overtown and Liberty City. ``We ran away from the uprising back
home in Palestine, now we find this.''
   Marvin Dunn, a psychologist and black activist, said economics
underlie the frustrations that led to the rioting.
   ``I don't see this as white against blacks, blacks against
whites,'' Dunn said. ``What is happening is that a larger and larger
segment of the black community is falling farther and farther behind
the rest of us in income and in the quality of life.''
   Fire Department spokeswoman Christy LeMay said a tally of damage
in Overtown and Liberty City totaled 13 buildings torched, seven of
them abandoned. Ten to 15 cars also were burned, she said.
   The family of Allen Blanchard, 24, one of the two black men
killed in the Monday night incident that set off the rioting, urged
calm for his Saturday burial. Clement Lloyd, 23, the motorcyclist
fatally shot in the head, will be buried Monday.
   An attorney for Officer William Lozano said Lloyd was driving
toward his client on a powerful motorcycle and that the officer shot
in self-defense.
   Miami police, the state attorney's office, the FBI and a special
community panel are investigating the death.
