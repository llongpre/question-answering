   There's a there there now.
   And it's a sculpture.
   A 17-foot tall swirl of metal slats, titled ``There,'' was
placed in City Square on Saturday in an attempt to discount author
Gertrude Stein's famous remark after returning to her hometown,
``There's no there there.''
   Officials of the city, which has long been treated like it was
San Francisco's ugly stepsister, hope the $95,000 artwork instills
civic pride.
   ``It adds to the city's image, but it's not going to solve the
problem. That can't be done with a sculpture,'' said Glenn Jones,
owner of The Candy Man, a new store in the heart of the city's
redevelopment efforts.
   Born in Oakland, Stein left in 1891 at the age of 17. Visiting
the city 44 years later, Stein noted that it had changed beyond
recognition.
   Stein, who died in 1946, used a writing style that relied on
repeating words to make a point. She often left out punctuation,
which she believed got in the way of the reader. She also wrote,
``A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.''

   Sarah Deacon's father often tried to amuse
his children by pouring pancake batter into the shapes of
dinosaurs, ducks and mice, but the results usually were
unidentifiable blobs.
   So 9-year-old Sarah came up with what she calls ``Funcake
Pancake Molds.''
   Besides solving her father's culinary problem, Sarah's idea has
won the regional portion of the ``Invent America'' competition.
   The contest, sponsored by the U.S. Patent Model Foundation, was
created to encourage creative thinking and problem-solving skills
in America's schools. Sarah's four pancake molds _ made of
lightweight aluminum in the shapes of a duck, bunny, mouse and
dinosaur _ will go up against the inventions of eight other
third-graders at the national competition in Washington next week.
   Her entry form says the molds ``make breakfast less boring and
more fun.''
   Sarah said she might continue inventing as a hobby, but she has
other career plans.
   ``I'd rather be a famous soccer player,'' she said.

   Monuments honoring Gen. Douglas MacArthur
may soon be springing up around the world, offspring of a giant,
500-year-old pine tree named after the World War II hero.
   The U.S. Forest Service and two men from Louisville, Ky., hope
to use seeds from the cones to start new trees and plant them near
the original in northern Wisconsin, and in places of historical
importance to MacArthur.
   The MacArthur pine was recognized as a champion white pine by
the American Foresty Association in 1945 and reigned as the
country's champion white pine for years until a storm blew off 40
feet from the 140-foot tall tree.
   Foresters said they are uncertain how much longer the tree will
continue to produce pine cones with the seeds for new trees. Last
year, the old pine only had a few cones, said Stan Lemaster, who
with Theodore Klein, has made a hobby of growing seedlings and
cuttings from historic trees.
   Lemaster said last week that he wants to provide seedlings from
the MacArthur pine to places important to the World War II general
such as Australia, Japan and the Philipines as well the military
academy at West Point, N.Y., and Little Rock, Ark., MacArthur's
birthplace.
   ``I would just love to propagate it,'' said Lemaster, who has
planted 316 trees in 122 cities in the 50 states, England, Canada,
Japan and Yugoslavia over the past 22 years. ``It would be one of
my favorite trees.''
