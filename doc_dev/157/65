   Neighborhood beautifiers who say
driveway basketball hoops are eyesores want to slam dunk them all.
Opponents eager to bench the plan say it's un-American.
   ``What's the point of having the pristine appearance in Garden
City if it's not for our children to enjoy,'' Donna Robins, the
mother of three ball-playing boys, said at a village trustees
meeting Thursday night.
   Others in town - including New York Knicks Hall of Famer Dave
DeBusschere and ex-New York Nets guard Bill Melchionne - are
mounting a fast break to overturn the town's policy.
   The flap actually began two years ago, when the affluent Long
Island town included basketball hoops under a 1924 law banning
``accessory structures.''
   Free-standing basketball hoops on the side and front of homes
were deemed unacceptable. Hoops attached to homes or garages or
free-standing hoops located in back yards were allowed to remain.
   About 60 people, most of whom opposed the ban, crowded into the
small village hall Thursday night.
   Joseph Asselta, an attorney with two boys and a hoop out front,
said he would take the town to court if officials order him to take
the basket down. He called the action unconstitutional because town
officials had not uniformly enforced the 66-year-old law.
   The trustees were unmoved. They said letters will be sent
immediately to 72 homeowners with offending hoops, giving them 90
days to comply.
   People who decide to flaunt the law and keep their rims intact
face up to a $250-a-day fine, although they should be able to
appeal to the local zoning board.
   ``I think it's absurd, and it seems ridiculous,'' said
Melchionne, who played on the ABA champion Nets in 1974 with Julius
Erving. ``If they don't have the availability of hoops, who knows
what kids will do?''
   DeBusschere echoed those comments to The Associated Press after
returning from a trip to the Soviet Union.
   ``I don't buy the idea that it's an eyesore. I think it enhances
a neighborhood. It humanizes it,'' said DeBusschere, who has a hoop
hanging - legally - in his back yard.
   ``The sound of a dribbling basketball and the swish of a
successful jump shot are the sounds of youtfful energy. ... It is
as American as apple pie,'' said village trustee Jack Curry, who
offered an alternate plan that was voted down.
   Mayor John McGowan, a member of the anti-hoops troops, shot
back: ``Garden City has nothing against anything all-American. The
village wants to keep Garden City beautiful, keep its aesthetic
beauty.''
   Curry's compromise would have saved all but three of the
existing hoops, and ensured all future buckets were 30 feet from
the nearest street. That plan was recently rejected by a 5-2 vote.
