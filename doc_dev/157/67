With the National Football League taking its traditional hiatus between the 
conference championship games and the Super Bowl, the television networks are 
turning to hockey and heavy doses of collegiate and professional basketball to 
fill the void this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since May 24, 1980, a National Hockey League game will be 
telecast by a major network, with NBC airing the 41st All-Star Game Sunday at 
10:30 a.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39. Cognizant of the bad camera angles that 
have traditionally made hockey a difficult sport to televise, NBC plans to 
station its cameras lower than usual and use a panoramic camera attached to the 
bottom of the center-ice scoreboard for an aerial view.

A heavier than usual college basketball schedule includes four consecutive 
games on Channel 2 today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Seton Hall at Pittsburgh at 9 
a.m; No. 3 Oklahoma at No. 23 Arizona at 11 a.m.; Notre Dame vs. No. 13 LSU at 
1 p.m. and USC at Stanford at 3 p.m. Channel 8 in San Diego will also carry the 
first three games.) On Sunday, No. 16 UCLA faces California at 3 p.m. on 
Channel 2.

Professional basketball moves to the forefront Sunday with a doubleheader 
featuring the National Basketball Assn.'s most attractive teams and players. 
The Lakers have their last chance at revenge against the Detroit Pistons before 
the playoffs at 9 a.m. on Channels 2 and 8, with the same stations broadcasting 
the Chicago Bulls-New York Knicks match-up at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mix celebrities from entertainment, politics and other sports with professional 
golfers and the result is the Bob Hope Classic, seen on Channels 4, 36 and 39 
today and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, for those who need football of any type to get through a weekend, 
there are three games this weekend. College seniors seeking to increase their 
worth in the NFL draft will perform in today's Senior Bowl at 11:30 a.m. on 
ESPN and the East-West Shrine Game Sunday at 11:30 a.m. on Channels 7, 3 and 
10. Jim Plunkett, Bart Starr and Roger Staubach are among former NFL stars 
participating in the inaugural Pro Football Legends Bowl, taped Friday in 
Phoenix, and shown at 3:30 p.m. today on Channel 4. STEVEN HERBERT
