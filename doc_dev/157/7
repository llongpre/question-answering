<LEADPARA>  MEMORIES of the founders of our games are mostly lost in history. Nobody
living today knew Abner Doubleday, if indeed he nurtured baseball's roots.;  
Football evolved from rugby and soccer. Hockey was first played by forgotten
Canadian soldiers. Scottish shepherds topped the early golf balls. French
clerics plopped the first tennis ball into a net.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But as basketball awaits this weekend's celebration in Springfield, Mass.,
of its 100th birthday, its creator, Dr. James Naismith, is still alive in the
mind of one of his grandsons.;   "I remember Papa Jimmy taking me to the old
Madison Square Garden in 1936 on his way to Berlin for the Olympics," Jim
Naismith, 68, said the other day. "I think we were in the Garden for the
Olympic Trials and after he tossed up the first ball, I sat with him in the
press row. But that day he was angry about something.";   Now stocky and
white-haired, the grandson was 12 then, and his grandfather was 74. For the
first time, the Olympics would include basketball.;   But the man who in 1891
had peach baskets hung in the Young Men's Christian Association Training
School gym in Springfield was annoyed at the selection process of the U.S.
team.;   "He was happy basketball was going to be played in the Olympics that
August," his grandson recalled, "but he was disappointed that it wasn't
serving the purpose it was meant to: a game you played for sportsmanship and
to use the winter months.";   In that case, what would Naismith think of
today's basketball with its multimillion-dollar pros about to soar into midair
in the Olympics next summer, its multimillion-dollar college tournament, its
multimillion-dollar television contracts, its multimillion-dollar sneaker
contracts for coaches?;   "I think he would consider the game itself to be a
natural evolution," his grandson said, "but the salaries might bother him. He
never thought of making money out of basketball. . . . He wasn't interested in
money. He turned down a considerable amount of money to endorse cigarettes."; 
 Naismith was a doctor of medicine and a doctor of divinity who also held a
master's degree in physical education.;   "He was a very firm Presbyterian
minister," his grandson remembered. "To him, it was important for the
spiritual, mental and physical aspects of life to work in harmony. But he was
a very kind, genial man. When he was at the University of Kansas, he would
drive out in his Model T Ford to visit us in Fort Collins, Colo. I would go
fishing and camping with this man I liked very much.";   He remembered
basketball's founder as a stocky 5-foot-8, with sturdy forearms from growing
up as a Canadian lumberjack.;   "He had a cauliflower ear, and he always had
that mustache you see in all those younger pictures of him wearing a suit and
a starched collar," he said with a smile. "That mustache was a prickly one. I
know that from all the times he kissed me.";   As it turned out, their day at
the 1936 Olympic Trials was the last time Jim Naismith would see his
grandfather, who died in 1939.;   "I follow the Knicks; I'm glad when they
win," said this now-retired chairman of the performing arts program at
Rockland County Community College. "But as a youngster, I was a terrible
basketball player. I couldn't dribble, I couldn't pass and I certainly
couldn't hit the basket. Not that my grandfather would have cared. To him,
other things in life were always more important."  </TEXT>
