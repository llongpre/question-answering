   He has written 50 books, a thousand newspaper
articles and once had his own wire service. But mostly Joseph Kane
is a collector of facts about who was the first to do this or that,
a debunker of erroneous history. It's been his calling for most of
his 89 years.

   Joseph Nathan Kane tells a visitor to come to
the 27th floor of an upper West Side building that has only 25
floors. He promises a $5 million view with $5 worth of furniture.
   Joe Kane will also tell you that the Declaration of Independence
was not signed on July 4, 1776, that George Washington was not the
first president, that Elias Howe did not invent the sewing machine
and that Charles Edgar Duryea really manufactured the first
automobile regularly made for sale.
   The 89-year-old ex-newspaperman and author is serious. Kane is
not just the author, but the entire staff of one of the most
unusual and most enduring reference books in the world _ ``Famous
First Facts: A Record of First Happenings, Discoveries, and
Inventions in the United States,'' as its first edition was called
when it was published in 1933.
   Kane is now working on the fifth edition _ the fourth came out
in 1981 _ as well as four other books he hopes to publish within a
year or two.
   Everything emanates out of this unusual apartment that has more
paper, 3-by-5 index cards, reference books and book cases than
places to sit down. Except for a few plants and the Dr Pepper he
keeps in the half-refrigerator, not much in this oddly shaped
oblong room seems to have been purchased in the last half-century.
Make that century.
   Kane, sole inhabitant of this garret for more than 25 years, is
not a man who exaggerates. The view from what passes as a kitchen
is worth $5 million, stretching up the Hudson River, beyond the
George Washington Bridge, down to the World Trade Center and
beyond, across into New Jersey.
   So what if you have to walk up the last two flights because the
elevator stops on 25?
   Kane is author of more than 50 books, some of which he churned
out to pay the rent, such as a forgettable volume called ``What Dog
Is That?'' describing various breeds of dogs. He also has sold more
than 1,000 newspaper articles. He once had his own news service and
was an accredited White House correspondent.
   He has been called a historian, a detective of facts, and a
deglorifier of American history.
   ``History,'' he proclaims, ``is a glorification of fairy tales.
There isn't a thing you know that is correct, but still it is
better to know something that is wrong than not to know anything.''
   It is better, for instance, to think that George Washington was
the first president than not to have any idea. The truth is
Washington was the first president elected under the Constitution,
but Thomas McKean of Delaware was the first president of the United
States in Congress Assembled under the Articles of Confederation in
1781, eight years before Washington took office.
   It is also good to know the importance of July 4, 1776. But the
accurate version, according to Kane, is that the Declaration of
Independence was first ordered ``to be fairly engrossed on
parchment'' on July 19, 1776, and was signed in Philadelphia on
Aug. 2 by 50 members of the original 56 who voted for its adoption.
The other six signed at later times, the last being Thomas McKean,
who was permitted to sign as late as 1781 due to serving in the
Army away from Philadelphia.
   ``Over 50 people have told me their father invented the
automobile, for example,'' he says. ``When I start verifying
claims, I find that someone's father may have invented the fourth
knob on the fifth spark plug on the sixth day at 7 o'clock,'' says
Kane. ``But he didn't invent the automobile.''
   It was Charles Edgar Duryea who opened the Duryea Motor Wagon
Company in Springfield, Mass., in 1895. He began building his
automobile in 1891 and first successfully operated it on April 19,
1892.
   Kane publishes only those facts that can be verified by patent
offices, official records in the Library of Congress, or other
original data.
   ``I'm stupid enough not to believe anything until I see the
proof,'' he says.
   Kane wrote his first book in 1929. It wasn't until four years
later, rejected by 11 publishers, that he sold the idea to the H.W.
Wilson Co., with a little help from librarians he met as he
crisscrossed the United States on an 11-month tour. He showed them
the local facts, which they knew to be correct, and then beseeched
them to write to the California-based company and say they would
love to have such a tome in their reference rooms.
