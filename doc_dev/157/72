<LEADPARA>  More than 30 inventors from around the country converged on the Fad Fair at
Philadelphia's Franklin Institute Science Museum last weekend. There they
showed off such goofy gizmos as decorative noses, balls made of "ooze" and
bicycle helmets with three-dimensional funny faces.;    The fair was organized
by Ken Hakuta, a local kids' TV personality called "Dr. Fad" and inventor of
the Wacky Wallwalker.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Most of the inventions on display need financial backers. Hakuta predicted
that 10 of them would be marketed and two would make money. That doesn't
discourage the inventors.;    Martha C. Crossley is hoping her "Narly Noggins
Helmet Stuff" will be a hit with kids who don't like to wear bicycle helmets.;
   The helmet add-ons, including goofy eyeballs and demon wings, already
should be at toy stores, selling for $2.99 to $4.99 a set.;    Boinks -- small
tubes of springy plastic in "rad" colors such as neon pink and lime green --
already have captured kids' imaginations, said Joyce Murphy, the woman who
markets them.;    Craig Boyko of Fairfield, Iowa, came to the Fad Fair with
two idiosyncratic inventions.;    One is the Ooz Ball, made of a substance
that stretches, bounces and makes popping sounds. The other is the Bite Lite,
a tiny, furry creature with teeth that can grasp a child's clothing and light
the way with a flashlight it carries in its tail. Great for kids who are
afraid of the dark.;    Boyko's first invention was the Zube Tube, a
three-foot cylinder that makes weird noises when people yell through it. About
1 million have sold since 1989. Inventor Saul Freedman arrived at the fair
with hopes of marketing his ice mug -- a molded container that melts away
after the liquid inside is consumed.;    Freedman, of Vineland, N.J., designed
the mug after discovering that many coastal communities don't allow beverages
on the beach because of the cups and bottles left behind. With Freedman's ice
mug, all that remains is a small wooden handle.  </TEXT>
