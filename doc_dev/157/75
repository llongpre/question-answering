<LEADPARA>  Q  I have a family barber shop in Menlo Park. It's an old-fashioned shop that
has many pictures on the walls and in the window of famous people and things
such as golfers, movie stars and the Spruce Goose. I would like to include
photos of Joe Montana of the 49ers and Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers.
Where should I write to ask for these? Is there a charge?;   -- John Aguirre,

<TEXT>  A  That depends on the team. For an 8-by-10 black-and-white glossy of Montana,
send a letter with your request and the number of photos you want along with a
check for $5 for each photo, to the San Francisco 49ers, 4949 Centennial
Blvd., Santa Clara 95054. For a similar shot of Moon, Houston's quarterback,
no money is required, just a written request sent to the Houston Oilers,
Public Relations, 6910 Fannin St., Houston 77030. That's for plain photos. If
you want Montana, Moon or any other professional football player to autograph
a photo, it's up to the player. Write him directly in care of his team's
address, which you can find in the Sports Directory of the World Almanac and
Book of Facts, available at the public library. The directory also lists
mailing addresses of major league baseball teams, National Basketball
Association teams and National Hockey League teams.;   Great gift idea; Q 
Have the creators of "Baby Blues" -- Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott -- produced
a collection of the comic strip in book form? If so, I think it would make a
great gift for new parents.;   -- Martin Brown, Campbell; A  Get out the
wrapping paper. A "Baby Blues" book came out in May published by Contemporary
Books, says a spokeswoman for Creators Syndicate Inc., which distributes the
comic strip. The book, "This is Going to be Tougher Than We Thought,"
following the trials of first-time parents, should be available at major book
stores, she says. Kirkman and Scott currently are on a book-signing tour of
the book, says the spokeswoman, who wasn't sure whether they would be at any
Bay Area bookstores. "Baby Blues," of course, appears seven days a week in the
Mercury News. And, incidentally, you can write Kirkman and Scott either in
care of the Mercury News or in care of Creators Syndicate, 5777 W. Century
Blvd., Suite 700, Los Angeles 90045.;    Not stumped for long; Q  Four months
ago, a large tree fell down during a wind storm and landed across the street,
smashing our new truck. The city sent out a crew immediately to clear the
street. But the stump is still there. I have called the city to find out about
getting the stump removed. All I'm told is that it takes time. We are tired of
looking at the city barricades and the stump. The stump is on Cottle Avenue.; 
 -- B.J., San Jose; A  Expect that unsightly stump to disappear in a few
weeks, says San Jose city arborist Mark Beaudoin. He says the city hires a
private contractor to remove stumps. Beaudoin says there are nearly 400 stumps
on a removal list and that he expects the list to only get longer after his
department takes an inventory of which trees didn't survive last winter's
freeze. Beaudoin moved the stump on your block up on the list and will notify
the contractor that he took the action.  </TEXT>
