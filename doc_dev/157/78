INCREASED PRESSURE TO WIN MAKES IT HARDER TO ACCEPT LOSING

Terry Truax was accustomed to winning. Work long enough with coaches such as 
Dean Smith at North Carolina and Morgan Wootten at DeMatha High School in 
suburban Washington, D.C., and victories are not only demanded, but expected. 
</P>
<P>
But this was different. 
</P>
<P>
Truax was on his own in 1985, in the midst of a second dreadful season at 
Towson State north of Baltimore. In the final seconds of a loss to Washington 
College, a forward named Greg McClinton didn't dive after a loose ball, and 
Truax became furious. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided then and there that I was going to kick this kid off the team, even 
though we had only seven healthy players," Truax said. "Another coach and a 
friend told me I couldn't do it. They were right. Greg McClinton turned out to 
be a fine young man. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll never forget it. I just couldn't handle losing. It was my own lack of 
maturity. What I learned is that it's only when you lose that you know what 
it's like to be a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Losing is an inescapable constant of college basketball, which moves into a 
second season Sunday with the selection of 64 teams for the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Division I tournament. Coaches may tire of recruiting, the 
media and the alumni, but they abhor defeat. A loss puts a coach one step 
closer to the unemployment line. Fifty-four Division I schools hired new 
basketball coaches this season. Want to bet the list will grow longer by next 
season? 
</P>
<P>
"When a coach loses, it's like a cataract over his eye," said 
coach-turned-sportscaster Al McGuire. "A losing coach is in the twilight zone." 
</P>
<P>
You hear the tales of rage. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue's Gene Keady slamming his fist on a blackboard after a loss. St. 
Joseph's Jim Boyle furious, unable to utter a word after his team gives away a 
game. Massachusetts' John Calipari ripping his sports coat and shirt in a rage. 
</P>
<P>
Losing also takes its toll physically. Truax gains weight during the season. 
Calipari's voice is constantly hoarse. Ulcers are part of the package. After he 
was fired as Loyola College of Maryland's coach last season, Mark Amatucci took 
a look in the mirror and was frightened by the reflection. There were dark 
circles under his eyes and his skin was pasty. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize in how bad a shape I was," said Amatucci, who now coaches at 
Anne Arundel Community College in Maryland. "When you lose, you question 
whether you did enough, and that just leads to a lot of sleepless nights. Then 
you start piling on the outside influences and pressures, and that drives you 
to the brink of breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
So, how do college basketball coaches handle losing? 
</P>
<P>
There are no facts or quick solutions or soothing potions to heal the coaches. 
This is a story of emotions, of men trying to deal with the essential element 
of competitive sports, that for every winner, there is a loser. Somehow, in a 
world of billion-dollar television contracts, March Madness and sneaker deals, 
the law of nature has been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"Win, win, win," said Shelby Metcalf, the Texas A&amp;M coach who feuded with 
his athletic director and was fired this year after 26 1/2 seasons and a 
438-306 record. "I used to take an Aggie fishing, and he didn't know if he had 
had a good time or not until he got to shore and counted the fish. That's 
wrong. When Dr. Naismith put up that basket, he didn't mean for it to be so 
bottom-line oriented. Heck, I was just having a ball all those years. Wasn't 
anyone else?" 
</P>
<P>
John Wooden never wanted to see a player cry after a game. When he was a senior 
guard at Martinsville High School in Indiana, his team lost the 1928 Indiana 
State Championship to Muncie, 13-12. In the locker room, some of his teammates 
wept. 
</P>
<P>
"We had played well, and we had lost," Wooden said. "Down deep, I was critical 
of my teammates for crying. I was able to accept these things better than 
most." 
</P>
<P>
Winning nine NCAA titles at UCLA and compiling an 88-game winning streak 
enabled Wooden to accept defeats. He was not always a gracious loser, but his 
rhetoric was proper, and his approach, at least in theory, served as a model. 
</P>
<P>
"When we failed in execution, that was me, because I failed to teach the 
players," he said. "The only time to get upset was when we didn't properly 
prepare. Coaches have to accept the fact that they are going to lose. You're 
not perfect. You'll make mistakes. But you can't cry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Sports psychologists preach honesty and perspective in dealing with emotions. 
But they recognize the limits of their prescription in a society that glorifies 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
"The more emphasis we put on winning, the more difficult it is to deal with 
losing," said Dr. Thomas Tutko, a sports psychologist at San Jose State. "The 
athlete can still get an education, but the coach's livelihood, his bread and 
butter, is on the line. The modern athlete is probably less concerned about 
winning or losing than the coach is." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Cylkowski, a performance counselor and sports psychologist based in 
Minneapolis, said winning becomes a way of life for coaches. Losing can damage 
a coach's ego, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
"In coaching, you're just a piece of a puzzle," he said. "Your ego has to come 
down a bit. There is no perfection in sports." 
</P>
<P>
Winning wasn't always a matter of career life or death. Once upon a time, teams 
played non-conference games to prepare for the "regular" season. Losses were 
part of the building process. 
</P>
<P>
That was before wall-to-wall basketball on television. 
</P>
<P>
"There was much less pressure," said Pete Newell, who guided California to the 
1959 NCAA title. "Now, with the TV and money, there is so much attached to 
getting to the Final Four. So many things that are wrong relate to money and 
what it can bring people." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Vitale, Billy Packer and McGuire used their roles as television analysts 
to put the coaches on the marquee and create college basketball's cult of 
personality. Coaches can now extract six-figure contracts from universities, 
but they are subjected to instant televised critiques. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaches weren't targets in the old days," Newell said. "Your moves weren't 
always analyzed. But all that has changed because of television." 
</P>
<P>
But the analysts sympathize with the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I was spoiled and hated losing," said Vitale, who coached at the University of 
Detroit and the Detroit Pistons. "You go to church on a Sunday and everyone 
looks at you, and they know if you were a success or failure the night before. 
If the ball hits nothing but net, you're a god. If it hits a rim, you're a 
bum." 
</P>
<P>
Vitale said coaches such as Dale Brown, Digger Phelps, Tom Davis, Lute Olson 
and P.J. Carlesimo handle losing well, "because they are able to come back 
positively the next day instead of yelling and screaming. A lot of guys who 
lose, they lose their self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
Keady, Gary Williams, Jim Boeheim and Bob Knight are among those who have 
difficulty accepting defeat, according to Vitale. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys who are emotional and show their intensity feel they're being scrutinized 
after a loss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Packer said coaches have a right to feel they're being judged after losses. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in a high-profile program deals with losing well," he said. "They 
realize each and every loss puts them closer to not having a job." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, who spent most of his career at Marquette, has become increasingly 
disenchanted with the motivations of the current coaching generation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that fear of losing is bringing down these guys," he said. "I 
think it's the money. When I was coaching, to be in the country club was your 
dream. Today, these guys are bigger than all the members of the country club. 
That's where the pressure comes from. You're living on a level with the nice 
threads, the cars, the stockbrokers. The fear of returning as an assistant 
coach, or selling socks or insurance, affects these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Losing brings out the rawest emotion in college basketball. The coach is caught 
on a stage, gesturing, screaming, the spiritual and intellectual center of a 
team. He must deal with defeat, both publicly and privately. 
</P>
<P>
At Maryland, Williams oversees a young team that is adjusting to his system. 
Graying, taut and tense, Williams is a 40-minute soap opera come to life, each 
missed basket or blown defensive assignment registering on his face. After a 
loss comes a transformation. Composed. Regal. A gentleman who shakes hands, 
walks across the court, slips on a set of headphones and eloquently discusses 
the game for a radio audience and the crowd at Cole Field House. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that you don't have a choice in the way you handle losing," 
Williams said. "You have to be rational. You can't always say how you feel. 
Sometimes, before games, I try to make sure I have my thoughts in order. 
Sometimes, in a close loss, you're in a little bit of shock. I don't like to 
lose. I can handle it. But I'm not a miracle worker." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Schneider of Loyola College dresses like a physics professor in a tweed 
jacket and gray slacks. Relaxed, hands clapping instinctively after good plays 
and bad, Schneider realizes screaming won't transform Loyola. Only patience and 
recruiting can put the Greyhounds into the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to temper your intensity," he said. "When I was a lot younger, I once 
walked into a pregame meal and got all over the team because they were joking 
and laughing. The next time I walked in for a meal, the kids were quiet, and I 
yelled at them for being too tight. I was internalizing everything." 
</P>
<P>
Towson State's Truax often paces absent-mindedly onto the floor, his face 
turning bright pink, a program rolled in his right hand. After a loss, he talks 
quietly, analyzing every fragment of the game. He does not sleep peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"You take the losses home with you," he said. "You try not to, but you're up at 
2, 3, 4 in the morning looking at films. Losing is frustrating, but you can't 
get down." 
</P>
<P>
You want to know how to lose? Check the guys who have been around, who can walk 
away from the losses with class, dignity and fire. 
</P>
<P>
Look at Paul Westhead at Loyola Marymount. After his team lost in overtime at 
Louisiana State, Westhead walked to the other bench, shook hands with LSU's 
Brown and left. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense treating losing like it's World War III," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Look at Jim Phelan at Mount St. Mary's, a small, private school, just going up 
the Division I elevator. But after 36 years and more than 600 victories and 300 
losses, Phelan manages to keep the game in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't take any of this personally," he said. "When I was just getting 
started as a coach, the student body was hanging me in effigy. You can't start 
taking blame for losses, because, all of a sudden, you'll go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Look at Butch van Breda Kolf, a grandfather who curses referees and molds teams 
at Hofstra. The only time he couldn't take losing, he quit a job with Detroit 
in the National Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
"We all get too wrapped up in this winning and records," he said. "When you 
forget about whys and only think about results, you get burned out in your 
40s." 
</P>
<P>
And finally, look at Lefty Driesell, one of the game's ultimate survivors. 
Whether at Davidson, Maryland or his current address, James Madison, it's all 
big-time to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always hated to lose," he said. "But if you won all the time, it wouldn't 
be fun. Losing is what makes coaching interesting."
