THERE'S EVEN ROOM FOR ROMAR IN THE BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME 
</P>

<P>
Part of the world's most extensive Romar collection hangs in a back room at the 
Basketball Hall of Fame, away from public view. 
</P>
<P>
The legend of Lorenzo Romar, a 6-foot-1 guard, began when he averaged 9.3 
points as a University of Washington senior. Or was it when the Golden State 
Warriors selected him in the seventh round of the 1980 draft, or when he 
averaged 7.6 points in his best National Basketball Assn. season, was waived 
three times in little more than a year, played for the Continental Basketball 
Assn.'s Evansville Thunder and Tampa Bay Thrillers in 1984-85, or . . . 
</P>
<P>
Before the 24-second clock runs out, let's toss this one up: What in the name 
of Topsy Del Gobbo is a Lorenzo Romar uniform doing here anyway? 
</P>
<P>
It's time Romar thanked the Detroit Pistons for waiving him Nov. 8, 1984. He 
went to Milwaukee, a free agent. His Detroit uniform went to the Hall of Fame, 
a goodwill contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes basketball fame is nothing more than convenience. The Pistons didn't 
need Lorenzo Romar, or his uniform. The Hall of Fame needed a Piston uniform 
for an exhibit of representative NBA uniforms. The rest, as they say at 1150 
West Columbus Ave., is basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
"Me? In the Hall of Fame?" said Romar, 30, who became a Christian six years ago 
and joined Athletes in Action in San Diego. "I wasn't even aware of it. It's a 
complete shock. And I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
Well, history at the Hall of Fame can mean many things. It can mean George 
Mikan, Bob Pettit, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Wilt Chamberlain, Pete Maravich and 
Julius Erving. And it can mean Lorenzo Romar, John Paxson, Mark McNamara, 
Clemon Johnson, Moore's All-American Redheads, the South Philadelphia Hebrew 
Assn. and the menu from Larry Bird's Boston Connection restaurant in French 
Lick, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," Romar said, "they're trying to draw some sort of contrast." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the contrast -- and a surprising number of genuine basketball artifacts 
-- is tucked away beyond the "Spalding Shoot Out," past the Bob Coyne cartoons, 
the Sports Illustrated covers and the NBA locker-stall exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
In an isolated storage area not much bigger than the Boston Celtics' locker 
room, a Romar uniform shares rack space with those of Earl Jones of Springarn 
High School in Washington, D.C., Neal Walk of Florida (the difference between 
him and UCLA's Lew Alcindor was a coin flip in the 1969 draft), LaRue Martin of 
Loyola, John Paxson of the San Antonio Spurs and Clemon Johnson of the 
Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
From the sublime to the generic: jerseys from the University of Connecticut 
(women's), Slippery Rock College and Punxsatawney High School. Detroit Piston 
fans should note that the latter was acquired for a Groundhog Day display, not 
for a tribute to Coach Chuck Daly. 
</P>
<P>
Here one can find trophies, stained green by time, saluting national industrial 
league champions from 30 years past, Civilian Conservation Corps and 
Caterpillar (as in tractor) AAU jerseys, a watch by Elgin commemorating the 
1944 NBL champion Zollner Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, those basketballs. A red, white and blue ABA edition ("Dave 
DeBusschere, Commissioner") signed by Julius Erving or immortalizing a 92-foot 
field goal by the Pacers' Jerry Harkness that beat the Dallas Chaparrals Nov. 
19, 1967. Even a ball from the 1924 National Interscholastic championship game 
-- Windsor (Colo.) 25, Yankton (S.D.) 6. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the bouncing balls and you'll find one dribbled 451.8 miles from 
Hodgdon, Maine, June 14-21, 1984 for the opening of the new Hall. Do not, under 
any circumstances, overlook the nonstop dribbling record of 347.2 miles at 
Covenant Children's Hospital in Decatur, Ill., Aug. 8-11, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Authenticity? Be serious. There's more tread left on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Could those be Bob Lanier's size-22 sneakers? And, there, below a tabletop with 
Michael Jordan's NBA All-Star jersey and Elgin Baylor's Seattle University 
jersey, Spud Webb's garment bag. Hold on . . . sorry, it's another Lanier 
colossus, a white canvas Converse, in a king-size sneaker bag. The other 
sneaker was part of the U.S. exhibit at last summer's World Expo in Brisbane, 
Australia. The Hall's prized Lanier pieces are a bronzed pair on display. 
</P>
<P>
Spike Lee and Michael Jordan weren't even Air-born when Lanier first laced up 
what may be the most famous artifacts in basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking industrial-strength odor-eaters," says Michael Brooslin, the 
Hall's curator. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the Hall's storage walls are 150-200 basketballs, 300 uniforms, a table 
of trophies, trinkets and watches, six shelves of sneakers, pennants, plaques, 
cartoons and life-size cutouts of Parade All-Americans. Boxes are stacked on 
top of boxes. And still more boxes: The Hall's inventory grows by 300-400 items 
yearly. Only a small percentage makes it to the big show, the Hall of Fame 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Some trophies are broken. You'll have to excuse the shooter's shattered left 
leg on the 1980 Pepsi-Cola NBA Old-Timers game trophy. But the gold touchtone 
phone presented to Ed Gottlieb at the 1969 NBA All-Star game probably could get 
through to the Miami Heat hotline. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like the 1986 Hall of Fame game trophy, are unwanted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was supposed to be given to the Celtics," Brooslin said. "They 
never took it." 
</P>
<P>
Politics (President Calvin Coolidge), royalty (Spain's Prince Felipe de 
Borbon), Hollywood (Cary Grant), fantasy (Linus, Snoopy, Charlie Brown), Lana 
Turner and Andre Turner converge here as unlikely memories of a game invented 
in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Springfield College professor. 
</P>
<P>
How to organize such a mess? Andy Warhol's estate recruited Sotheby's. The Hall 
of Fame has only Brooslin to sort, document and organize an intriguing 
collection from the 1890s to the 1980s. Brooslin, 33, became the Hall's first 
curator almost two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually everything was in boxes before I came here," Brooslin said. "Now we 
pretty much know what we have. But it's a five-year type of deal. It looks like 
we'll go to a computer next year. That will help.' 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Brooslin sits before stacks of index cards, tagging and 
cataloguing. Although Brooslin admits to visiting the old Hall of Fame at 
Springfield College only once while a student at nearby American International, 
he says he's having the time of his life. Beats his last job by a longshot -- 
curator of the National Rollerskating Museum in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Some items Brooslin will never ID, such as the faded orange tanktops with 
stenciled numbers, no player or team names. The tag reads, "Orange tank, 
unidentified." 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like, 'Why the heck do I even have these?' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon Brooslin returned from the basketball shelves, his eyes 
as big as the Walter Brown Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a complete inventory," he says. "I didn't even know I had this 
Hollywood stars basketball until two days ago." 
</P>
<P>
Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Tony Curtis. Lana Turner, Barbara Stanwyck, Hayley 
Mills. Gene Kelly, Doris Day, Gina Lollabrigida. Tony Randall, Sandra Dee, Rock 
Hudson. It's a bouncing Hollywood autograph book, auctioned by Dorothy Lamour 
to raise funds for the 1968 Olympic team. The Beta Shoe Company bought it for 
$285. 
</P>
<P>
If only the names were so clear on the lace-up ball signed by Calvin Coolidge. 
His signature and the year, 1924, are clearly visible. So is John C. Jeets, 
tournament director. That's about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone through it and through it," Brooslin said. "I can't even figure out 
what tournament it is." 
</P>
<P>
A classic ball -- so, it looks like a football exposed to a mutant air pump -- 
with a president's signature doesn't make the cut. It sits next to a ball 
dribbled 185 miles by Boxboro High School on Dec. 23, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to use it not so much for the signature," Brooslin said, "but it's one 
of the better lace-up balls we have. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors pay up to $5,000 for a uniform. The Coolidge ball? 
</P>
<P>
"For that particular basketball," says Carol Sherman of Profiles in History, an 
autograph broker in Beverly Hills, Calif., "we'd probably price it at 
$500-$1,000. If we knew who else signed it, it might be worth much more." 
</P>
<P>
Profiles prices the "Hollywood" ball at $750-$1,000. Of course, once in the 
Hall, always in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Collectors," Brooslin said, his faced curled in a sour look. "I don't even 
want to talk about it. With old stuff, it can be difficult for us. But anything 
new, you know who's going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Remember the NBC peacock, brought to you in living color? Presenting Ira 
Harge's contribution to basketball history, a 1971-72 ABA Miami Floridians 
uniform: black, orange with a magenta stripe and stirrups. Let's be kind and 
say the design lies somewhere between Bo Ellis and Alexander Julian. 
</P>
<P>
And no ABA collection is complete without a Marvin Barnes (never inducted, 
never indicted) original, "Spirits of St. Louis" printed in orange over the 
Lindbergh plane with "Marvin" on the back. 
</P>
<P>
For pure, glow-in-the-dark slickness, we suggest a red satin jacket with an 
Indian emblem worn by Clarence (Bevo) Francis. An appropriately flashy outfit 
for someone who scored 113 points for Rio Grande College against Hillsdale Feb. 
2, 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Francis' jacket was displayed in the old Hall, more a shrine for New England 
basketball. Now the uniforms of Walter Luckett (Kolbe-Bridgeport), Tom Roy 
(South Windsor) and Ron Perry (Catholic Memorial) and a ball commemorating 
Danny Moore's 71-point night for South Catholic Feb. 13, 1970 are here, in the 
Hall of Fame but not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Well, take heart. Fillipe de Borbon's Celtic jersey, a replica of that given 
Spain's prince at the McDonald's Open last year, didn't make it. Even though, 
Brooslin says, "It's our first piece of royalty." 
</P>
<P>
You'll also find Rick Barry's No. 24 (Golden State Warriors), Oscar Robertson's 
No. 4 from the Cincinnati Royals, Earl Monroe's No. 10 from Winston-Salem, 
ceramic ashtrays made by Maurice Stokes, the uniform top of Dick Van Arsdale 
(Phoenix Suns) and the shorts of twin brother Tom, a crumbling banner from the 
1904 Universal Expo in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
And Lorenzo Romar. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to give some reasons why I'm there," Romar said, "but I can't think 
of any statistic that would qualify me for the Hall of Fame. I had a career 
high of 22 points, twice. I had eight steals once. I had 14 assists a couple of 
times -- guys are almost averaging that now." 
</P>
<P>
But he was waived at the right time. Twice. Don't bother looking for Romar's 
Warrior uniform. You'll never see it. The other half of the Hall's Romar 
collection is open year-round to the public, part of the NBA uniform exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
It's true. Lorenzo Romar, Detroit Pistons, has made it to the floor of the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Don't give up hope, Mike Smrek.
