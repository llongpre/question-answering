   Saying ``hail to the victors'' and neatly
sinking a free-throw shot in the Rose Garden, President Bush on
Wednesday honored the University of Michigan for winning the NCAA
basketball championship.
   ``Today America is talking, and they're talking about you all,
and your incredible championship, and they're calling it Wolverine
Wonder, or the Michigan Miracle, or basketball's impossible
dream,'' Bush said. ``The 1989 Wolverines indeed had it all, depth
and quickness, shooting and intelligence, and that strength of
character which embody the champion.''
   The Wolverines won the NCAA basketball championship a week ago
Monday against Seton Hall, as junior guard Rumeal Robinson sank two
free throws in the final seconds of overtime for the 80-79 victory.
   ``Today, `Hail to the Victors' is the number one basketball hit
parade song,'' Bush said. ``Mission impossible? Yours has been a
mission accomplished.''
   A portable basketball hoop had been set up in the White House
Rose Garden, and Bush escorted Robinson over to demonstrate his
skill. ``Now this may not be regulation,'' Bush said as Robinson
sighted on the basket, removed is coat, and lofted the ball in.
   Next it was Bush's turn. He sank his free throw the first try.
   Michigan Coach Steve Fisher on behalf of the university's
basketball staff gave Bush a ``Michigan No. 1'' jersey.
   ``I think the pride that surrounds this city and White House is
indicative of what all of us strive for, to be champions and to be
number one,'' Fisher told reporters after the ceremony. ``We feel
fortunate, but proud, that the hard effort and work that we put in
allowed us to be here.''
