<LEADPARA>  The skin-hugging unitards must go.;    But women's basketball stars -- past
and present -- are hoping America's latest try at a professional women's
league -- the Liberty Basketball Association -- will stand up to problems that
crushed past attempts. The LBA's debut was televised Monday by ESPN, and play
begins in earnest in December.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Obviously, I'd prefer to play here as opposed to overseas," said Stanford
senior guard Sonja Henning, an All-America candidate. "But it seems this
league is trying to change the game.";    The basket was lowered 10 inches
from the standard 10 feet, the basketballs are three inches smaller than in
the NBA or college and the court was shortened four feet.;    And there are
those unitards.;    "I don't think basketball players are ready to wear track
outfits," said ex-UCLA All-American Ann Meyers, echoing comments of the women
who played Monday.;    Meyers played in the now-defunct Women's Basketball
League. The WBL failed, she said, because its owners were unqualified.;   
"They treated the women as girls," Meyers said, "and not as businesswomen.";  
 The LBA might be making the same mistake, unless paying its players a
per-game salary of only $250, with an extra $100 going to each of the winners,
sounds like good business. In Japan and Europe, top women's players make from
$50,000 to $200,000 annually.  </TEXT>
