IN SPORT OF TEAM HANDBALL, THERE'S A TEAM . . . BUT NO HANDBALL; 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPIC FESTIVAL: OBSCURITY OF SPORT IN UNITED STATES ALLOWS INEXPERIENCED LISA 
BASSI TO TEAM WITH VETERAN RHONDA WEYER ON WEST TEAM.

It is one of Europe's favorite team games. In most countries, it is second in 
popularity only to soccer. European boys and girls play this contact sport 
daily in the schools. Yet, in the United States, team handball is virtually 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, that is good news for Fullerton College softball Coach Lisa Bassi. 
Team handball's obscurity here has helped Bassi, 28, make the U.S. Olympic 
Sports Festival West team -- despite having virtually no experience playing the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
She joins the West's most experienced veteran, Rhonda Weyer, 27, a Katella High 
School softball coach who has played the sport for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Team handball competition begins Wednesday in Minneapolis, with the gold-medal 
game Sunday. Until then, the North, South, East and West teams will practice 
and scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
The scrimmaging is a must, especially for Bassi, who has been playing the sport 
only since April when she went to the Sports Festival tryouts in Calabasas, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she is going to pick up the game very quickly because she is used to 
playing ball and she wants to learn," said Henriette Hansen, the West's coach. 
"She is like, 'Can we play? Can we play?' She can't get enough, and that is 
very important when you are not young anymore and you want to learn a new 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
Practice time was limited before the West squad headed to Minneapolis. "We have 
had one practice as a team before coming out here," Bassi said. "The coach 
said, 'What position do you play?' and I laughed. That's exactly what I did. I 
said, 'Whatever you want to me to play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Team handball is nothing like handball, where two people use their hands to hit 
a racquetball-sized sphere against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"It is incredibly physical," said Bassi, who lives in Huntington Beach. "They 
say it is water polo without the water, soccer without the kicking and hockey 
without the sticks. So you can imagine the aggressiveness of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Don't think that a beginner such as Bassi made the team just because there are 
so few experienced handball players in the country. Though she is a novice, her 
athletic credentials are impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
She played on Sports Festival softball teams for five years. She played club 
volleyball, and basketball and softball during her high school years at 
Chaffey. She attended Cal Poly Pomona, where she competed in softball and 
cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
Bassi has the kind of background that coaches look for in a team handball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for people who have athletic ability, period, which is unlike 
all the other sports because the athletes are highly trained specifically for 
their sport," Bassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, who lives in Newport Beach, got the job as West coach only a month ago 
after the original coach accepted an offer to play professional basketball in 
Japan. Hansen is a native of Denmark, the origin of team handball. 
</P>
<P>
"I always say that if you are a good basketball player but not good enough to 
make it on a big league team, then team handball is a good thing because you 
have a (better) chance to be on the national team," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Bassi dreamed of playing basketball, her first love, in the Olympics, but her 
5-5 height made that difficult. The contact in team handball never intimidated 
her; in fact, she requested to play one of the more physical positions -- 
circle runner. 
</P>
<P>
The circle runner sets picks against defenders along a half circle that 
protects a net or goal. The picks are designed to free teammates for shots. 
"You have to be strong to play the circle because you are fighting with the 
defensive players," Hansen said. "You are the only one who is in contact with 
them all the time. You can't be scared of hurting your knees, because the team 
you're going to play against is going to throw you around." 
</P>
<P>
Bassi has no such fear. "I don't think I enjoy abuse, but I enjoy contact," she 
said. "I was raised with my older brother. He was very athletic and liked to 
roughhouse, and I was his little brother, so to speak. I just developed that 
aggressive behavior along the way." 
</P>
<P>
It comes in handy for team handball, but players who get too physical are 
penalized by temporarily being removed from play. 
</P>
<P>
Team handball is most often played on a wooden surface a bit wider and longer 
than a basketball court. As in basketball, one can dribble and pass. 
</P>
<P>
At either end of the court is a goal about 10 feet wide and 6 feet tall, 
protected by a goalie. Six court players attempt to throw a volleyball-sized 
ball past the goalie to score a single point in the course of two 30-minute 
halves. There are no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is surrounded by a half-circle, where most of the action takes place. 
Defensive players line up along it. 
</P>
<P>
"The half-circle represents the goalie area," Weyer explained. "Nobody is 
allowed in that area except the goalie, unless you're going to shoot. That is 
where the diving comes in. You must shoot the ball before you hit the floor in 
the circle area." 
</P>
<P>
Diving is Weyer's specialty. She earned a reputation as a flopper during her 
basketball days at Cal State Fullerton from 1981-85, when she hit the hardwood 
as regularly as a dust mop. 
</P>
<P>
She became involved with team handball after college. She played for the West 
basketball team at the 1981 Sports Festival. She first saw team handball at Cal 
State Fullerton, where there was a club team. She also worked as a supervisor 
for the 1984 Olympics at the team handball venue at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The contact in the game didn't intimidate her, she said. "It is a much quicker 
game than basketball. It was something different. I had never seen it before 
and it was an eye-catcher for me . . . being able to make shots against a 
goalie, diving and the different passes, the finesse of the games. It was like 
watching the Lakers and Magic Johnson with all these fantastic passes and 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Weyer was hooked. She has been on the national team for the past 2 1/2 years 
and played for the West in the 1985, '86, '87 and '89 Sports Festivals, which 
are held in non-Olympic years. 
</P>
<P>
She trained with the national team at Marquette, Mich., and at the Olympic 
Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., for almost two years. She missed an 
opportunity to play in the 1988 Olympics after spraining her right thumb in the 
summer of 1987 and had to have her hand placed in a cast. The cast came off six 
weeks later, but in the interim, there had been a coaching change and Weyer 
said she was lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
Weyer decided to return to Cal State Fullerton for her final year and her 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
Weyer plays one of the primary shooting positions. "Her strength is that she 
makes only a few errors in the game, she knows what she is doing and she is 
strong," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Weyer is weighing whether she will try again to make the Olympic team, that is 
if the United States qualifies for Olympic competition in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"They have asked me back to Colorado Springs quite a few times, but I have been 
committed to other things, like coaching softball at Katella, and I would like 
to get my teacher's credential," Weyer said. "I possibly might. It is something 
I need to think about a little bit more." 
</P>
<P>
Bassi, on the other hand, knows her niche is at Fullerton College, where she 
teaches physical education and coaches the softball team. 
</P>
<P>
"My motivation for playing team handball is really twofold," Bassi said. "What 
I would like to do, obviously, is compete. And No. 2, what I would like to do 
is teach a class, develop a team handball class for Fullerton College and teach 
and promote the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We really need to get developmental programs going at the high school level to 
make this a sport to stay in America."
