<LEADPARA>  ONE Man's Opinion Is That The 49ers Will Be The Best Team Not To Make The
Playoffs . . .;   (check) Imagine. The 49ers' playoff hopes now ride on the
arm of Jay Schroeder. You're thinking the same thing I am, right? Is it
possible for Ken Stabler to come out of retirement?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (check) On the other hand, maybe this is what the 49ers had in mind all
along when they allowed Ronnie Lott and Roger Craig to sign with the Raiders.
Once more, they'll be carrying the 49ers' postseason hopes on their shoulders.
Who would have thought?;   (check) If the playoff berth comes down to the
fifth tie-breaker, I believe that's the one where you count the number of gray
hairs on the coaches' scalps and divide it by the number of flaming fireballs
that fell from the ceiling during head-to-head matchups. And by my
calculations, George Seifert wins that one easily over Jim Mora.;   (check) If
the 49ers do miss out on the playoffs by one game, which of the 49ers' losses
does Seifert think was the killer? "I won't have to say it," Seifert answered.
"There will be a million people talking about it." He meant the Hail-Mary play
in Atlanta, of course. But personally I'd pick the 16-14 opening-night loss to
the Giants. As we've since seen, they were a team the 49ers should have
defeated easily.;   (check) All those people who complain that Steve Young
should learn to slide feet-first when he scrambles out of the pocket to avoid
injury finally got their wish Saturday. He tried one slide against Kansas City
at the end of a bootleg run -- and was promptly cheap-shotted by Kansas City's
Ervin Randle. Said Young afterward: "No more sliding." He was only kidding. I
think.;   (check) I'll never understand baseball fans. How many times have you
heard the following conversation over a cold beverage at your local sports
bar? These baseball players drive me crazy; they make millions and then they
skip workouts, get in trouble with the law, set bad examples. The heck with
them. But when the Giants trade away Kevin Mitchell, who fits that description
completely, the very same fans go nuts and talk only about his home runs. Hey,
you can't have it both ways.;   (check) If the NBA had wire-service polls like
college basketball, the Warriors would be ranked in the top 10, but not the
top five. But if Billy Owens learns to hit his jump shot, look out in the
postseason tournament.;   (check) One thing I like about hockey: When a
penalty is called, the game actually becomes more exciting, not duller. The
offender goes to the penalty box and his team must play one man short for two
or more frantic minutes. Compare that to basketball, when a foul means the
clock stops, everyone stands around, and one guy stands still to shoot free
throws.;   (check) One thing I don't like about hockey: Goalies are allowed to
personalize their masks by painting them colorfully, but the other skaters
aren't allowed to do the same thing with their helmets. If they're looking for
a way to add more personality to the game, why not start there?;   (check) One
thing I didn't know about the Cow Palace: According to former manager Ed
Diran's entertaining book about the place, "Cow Palace Great Moments," the
building has a place in hockey history. Frank Zamboni, inventor of the machine
bearing his name, set up shop for a month at the Cow Palace during a 1951 ice
show to experiment with one of his early models.;   (check) One thing I do
know about the Cow Palace: No matter how bad the parking is at San Jose's
Arena in two years, it will be heaven compared to Daly City. And to those who
say the existing downtown San Jose garages will be too far from the arena
front door, I'd rather make that walk than the one from the outer reaches of
either the Cow Palace or Oakland Coliseum's parking area.;   (check) Oh, yes.
Assuming the knee's all right, start Bono next Monday. Even if the 49ers are
eliminated by then. After what he's done, the guy deserves one last, long
standing ovation.  </TEXT>
