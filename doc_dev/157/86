   A biodegradable golf tee and a finger puppet
that prevents thumb-sucking were among the inventions by
kindergarten and elementary school pupils to be recognized Thursday
at the annual ``Invent America!'' competition.
   Each of the nine winners, chosen from a group of 45 finalists,
received a $1,000 savings bond at the awards luncheon. One winning
invention was chosen for each grade.
   The contest, with a number of corporate sponsors, was begun in
1987 as part of a program to foster creativity and inventiveness
among the nation's school children. It is administered by the
private, nonprofit United States Patent Model Foundation.
   Erin Amos, a kindergartener from Tecumseh Elementary School in
Nebraska, invented the ``Thumb Huggers.''
   ``The happy-hugger keeps me company in bed so I don't have to
suck my thumb,'' he said.
   Casey Golden, a fifth-grader at Bergen Elementary School in
Evergreen, Colo., invented a ``Bio-D-Tee'' containing grass seed.
If the tee is broken during a shot, ``it stays on the grass and
will degrade when the grass is watered. The grass seed from the tee
will start to grow.''
