   Business sales far outpaced inventory
accumulation in August, the government said Monday in a report that
one analyst attributed to a mini-inventory correction.
   The Commerce Department said inventories edged up 0.3 percent to
a seasonally adjusted $789.9 billion while sales advanced a steep
3.1 percent to $526.8 billion. The pace in inventories was down
from a 0.9 percent hike in July while sales rose from a 0.9 decline
the previous month.
   The combination of sales advancing far faster than the
accumulation of goods on shelves and backlots is good news for the
economy. If inventories were to pile up excessively, it could mean
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs.
   ``Basically, the inventories do not appear to show any signs of
vulnerability,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for The
Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   ``I've been impressed by how managements have been keeping
inventories from getting seriously out of hand,'' he said.
   The Commerce report showed a decrease in the ratio of
inventories to sales from 1.54 in July to 1.50 in August. That
means it would take one and a half months to exhaust inventories at
the August pace.
   Manufacturers' inventories, which represent about 45 percent of
the total, were up only 0.3 percent, while wholesalers' backlogs
actually dropped 0.1 percent.
   Retailers' inventories, however, rose 0.7 percent, which
economist Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank in New York
attributed in large part to a 1.6 percent advance in automobiles.
   Niemira described the slowing pace of inventory growth as a
``mini-inventory correction'' that began last year in manufacturing
and has been working its way through the other sectors.
   Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, rose 5.6 percent,
followed by wholesalers', up 1.5 percent. Retailers' sales gained
0.7 percent.
   Overall both inventories and sales were 7.1 percent above those
of August 1988.
