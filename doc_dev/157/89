   Business inventories grew slowly in February, rising 0.1% after growing rapidly four months in a row, the Commerce Department said. 

   Inventories at the end of February totaled $715.85 billion after increasing 0.7% in January. 
The department previously put the January increase at 0.4%. 
The numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, but not for inflation. 

   Manufacturers' inventories, which account for nearly half of all business inventories, rose 0.5%. 
Wholesale inventories rose 0.9%. 
But retailers' inventories, which have been rising in recent months, fell 1.1%. 
Total inventories rose 0.9% in December, 0.8% in November and 1.2% in October. 

   Business sales in February totaled $468.3 billion, up 0.6% from $465.73 billion in January. 

   Businesses had enough inventories on hand to last 1.53 months at the current pace of sales. 
That's down from 1.54 from January, but up from 1.50 in February 1987. 

   The manufacturers' ratio of inventories to sales was 1.63, unchanged from January. 
The wholesalers' ratio was 1.29, down from 1.30. 
And the retailers' ratio fell to 1.60 from 1.63.
