Point Loma High School's girls are playing for the Southern California Division 
II basketball championship today. 
</P>
<P>
As news goes, this is dog-bites-man stuff. 
</P>
<P>
A regional final without Point Loma's girls would be like Donald Trump without 
an ego, Jack McKeon without a cigar or Lee Hamilton without an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it just doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our seventh time in eight years," said Coach Lee Trepanier, who has 
coached basketball's version of the Pointer sisters to 335 victories and a mere 
50 losses over 15 years. "Just think, we're one game away from state." 
</P>
<P>
Again. 
</P>
<P>
And Coach T, as they call him, was marveling at the thought, as though in awe. 
Obviously, each time is as nice as the time(s) before. 
</P>
<P>
That one game Point Loma needs to win to get to the state final (again) will be 
against Pasadena Muir at 1:30 in the Los Angeles Sports Arena. Win today, and 
the kids get a chance to hang still one more state championship banner along 
the wall of the campus gym up there on Chatsworth Boulevard. There are four 
there already. 
</P>
<P>
Muir, however, represents an interesting footnote in the recent history of 
Point Loma girls' basketball. 
</P>
<P>
In December 1985, to be precise, Muir beat Point Loma in one of those holiday 
tournament games. Point Loma had won 62 consecutive games before that loss and 
74 consecutive games after it, accounting for a tidy record of 136-1 over a 
stretch of five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Muir, in this sense, was like the pitcher who stopped Joe DiMaggio's streak. 
</P>
<P>
Those, of course, were different teams and different players. Successful 
coaches with successful programs are able to sustain through the inevitable 
transitions, which might be more volatile on the high school level than 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Trepanier qualifies as a successful coach running a successful 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Understand that he might not win many popularity contests north of I-8 or east 
of I-5 or south of Rosecrans. His detractors insist his players arrive 
literally by the busload from other areas in the San Diego district. So what? 
The busing program is tied into the district curriculum. To hear others (read 
that losers) tell it, the guy brings his players to school in limousines. 
</P>
<P>
Paying this juggernaut a visit Thursday night, I expected to find Little Miss 
Showtime. Just roll out the basketball and turn 'em loose. Naturally, they 
would be tall, fast and flashy. Jack Nicholson might even be there to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, they looked more like they came out of a biology class. Their 
warm-up jerseys had nicknames such as Untouchable, Stretch, Rocko, Mighty Jo 
and E-Bay Lok (as well as some less imaginative real names such as Davis, 
Stacy, Moss and Neves). 
</P>
<P>
When the game began, I could see why Neves would choose her own name rather 
than a nickname. Claudine Neves was nothing but serious. She was the point 
guard, running the offense, and her determination and discipline seemed to 
define the work ethic of the team. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this was far from a flash-and-dash aggregation. The word that comes to 
mind is gritty. 
</P>
<P>
Both Point Loma and its opponent, La Quinta, went into the game with 28-3 
records. Point Loma had its star, Tyeast (Untouchable) Brown, and La Quinta had 
its star, Amy Jalewalia, and what they did was virtually neutralize each other. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jalewalia's teammates were getting the best of Brown's. Point Loma 
looked like it was going anywhere but to another Southern California 
championship game. It made only one of 16 shots in the first quarter and five 
of 30 in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Given those numbers, one might assume the Pointers trailed by maybe 20 points. 
Not exactly. That dirty D word, defense, kept them close. 
</P>
<P>
With La Quinta's players hanging all over Brown like Christmas ornaments, Point 
Loma came up with another hero for the occasion. Robin (Rocko) Rabello made big 
baskets at the end of the second and third quarters to keep it close and yet 
another with seven seconds to play in the game to provide the comfort zone in 
what was finally an uncomfortable 39-36 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Rabello, of course, is yet another of those made-to-play-basketball kids 
Trepanier is so "lucky" to get. Not exactly. She is a senior who came into the 
season with three soccer letters and zero basketball letters. She simply kept 
her wits about her and got the job done. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what struck me in watching this game was that all these girls remained 
calm and controlled even when things were bleak and time was getting short . . 
. and this was definitely a game that could have gotten away. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to understand why Point Loma's girls will be playing in their 
seventh Southern California regional championship game in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Because Lee Trepanier will be coaching his seventh regional championship game 
in eight years.
