   Sarah Lindsay, whose husband was killed two months
ago in an avalanche that narrowly missed his friend Prince Charles,
has given birth to a daughter.
   A brief announcement in The Times of London on Friday said the
baby, as yet unnamed, was born May 14.
   Maj. Hugh Lindsay, a 34-year-old career army officer and former
aide to Queen Elizabeth II, was hit by a lump of ice when the
avalanche swept down a mountain at Klosters in the Swiss Alps on
March 10 while the royal party was skiing off the main trail.
   Charles, heir to the British throne, and several members of the
party skiied clear but another friend suffered serious leg injuries.
   Mrs. Lindsay, a 34-year-old Buckingham Palace press aide, was
feeling fine and was ``very happy'' about the baby, her father,
Brian Brennan, was quoted as telling the London Evening Standard.

   Gov. Roy Romer will drag race against a
police officer to promote Communities for a Drug Free Colorado, the
governor's anti-substance abuse program.
   The Memorial Day event was set up by officials of the Bandimere
Speedway and Chevrolet dealers. The governor will drive a Corvette.
   Romer never has raced a car, he said.
   Still, the 59-year-old Romer says he isn't worried about the
race.
   ``I've never driven a Corvette in my life ... but I deal with
fast equipment,'' said the governor, a pilot since he was 18.
``Surely if I fly, I can drive a drag racer.''
   The police officer, Steve Adams of Arvada is part of a
``Race-A-Cop'' team that competes in the Denver area in an effort
to bridge the gap betwen youth and police.
   And on Sunday, the governor will address Agate High School
graduates. Both of them.
   The address will be in the school gymnasium at Agate, a tiny
farming community 90 miles east of Denver. The two graduates are
Penny Robbins and Richard Padilla.

   Elementary school lessons still play a
role in his life, the Boston Celtics' Kevin McHale told a
fifth-grade class that produced a biography of the basketball
player, the school's most famous alumnus.
   ``I still remember the books you read for us back in school,''
McHale wrote to Pat Mattson, who was his language arts teacher in
the late 1960s. ``I read a book or two every week now. It must have
been that good schooling.''
   Earlier this year, students in Mattson's creative writing class
at Greenhaven Elementary School produced nine pages of verse
titled, ``The Tall Tale of Kevin McHale.''
   But McHale first saw a copy of the book when interviewed by CBS
Sports for a feature on the class project. The feature was
broadcast May 8 during half-time of a National Basketball
Association game.
   ``Like most things that happen, I was one of the last people to
see the poem,'' he said in a letter thanking the class this week.
