<LEADPARA>  WITH the increased talk that academics should come before athletics, I thought
I'd apply it to this column. With that in mind, . . . .;    Special attention
must be awarded to the girls' soccer team at Los Altos High and boys' soccer
team at Palo Alto High for posting the highest collective grade point average
among the five winter sports teams in the Central Coast Section.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Los Altos' gals posted a GPA of 3.5984, while Paly's boys earned a 3.4755
mark.;    Although Gunn failed to earn any academic team awards, the Titans
placed in the top six in each of the five sports -- boys' and girls'
basketball, boys' and girls' soccer and wrestling.;    No other athletic
program in the CCS accomplished this feat, although academically demanding
Bellarmine Prep, an all-male school in San Jose, finished in the top six in
the three winter boys' sports.;    While we're on the subject of student
achievements, pupils Kurtis Townsend and John Grosey made former teacher Bud
Presley a proud man two weekends ago.;    Townsend and Grosey each played
basketball for Presley at Menlo College in Atherton during the late 1970s and
early 1980s and they each won Central Coast Section titles as coaches.;   
Grosey's Serra High boys' basketball team won the CCS Division I title over
Santa Teresa and University of Arizona-bound Kevin Dempsey 57-46. Grosey
didn't use any gadgets to hold Dempsey to eight points (Presley probably
wouldn't talk to him had he used any gimmicks).;    Grosey used the skin-tight
man-to-man defense the 68-year-old Presley still stresses at clinics.;    The
next night, Townsend's Leigh boys' basketball team used the same defense to
limit San Mateo to two points during a four-minute stretch of their 66-56 win
for the CCS Division III boys' title.;    After the game, Townsend quickly
pointed out that he learned to employ the tough defense while playing under
Presley.;    The CCS tournament also saw two of the Peninsula's most
remarkable athletes -- Menlo School's Jim Noriega and Menlo-Atherton's Chi
Johnson.;    Once again, Noriega showed his magic in the section finals. With
five titles in three sports on his resume, Noriega provided the recipe for the
sixth crown.;    With less than a minute left and Menlo School trailing Valley
Christian 45-44, Noriega showed the poise of a veteran. He tried to penetrate
to the basket but didn't see an opening. Instead of forcing a drive or a shot,
Noriega pulled back out and called a timeout with 24 seconds left.;    The
play was set for him. Noriega dribbled past a screen and banked in the
go-ahead shot with 14 seconds left. Moments later, Noriega knocked the ball
away from his opponent, forcing Valley Christian to attempt an off-balance
shot that failed as the buzzer sounded.;    I was aware that Johnson was the
defending state high jump champion, winning with a leap of 5 feet, 8 inches. I
was surprised to see her in person on the basketball court, standing only
5-foot-4.;    She proved her height made no difference, scoring 27 points in a
variety of ways to lead M-A to a 62-51 victory over Notre Dame of Salinas in
the CCS Division II girls' title game.;    If the spring season can be half as
exciting, . . .  </TEXT>
