   Business inventories rose 0.9 percent in
December, the biggest increase since October, and sales jumped 0.8
percent for the fastest gain since August, the government reported
today.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots rose to a seasonally adjusted $760.6 billion, while sales
reached $508.2 billion.
   December's 0.9 percent boost in inventories followed a 0.4
percent increase in November. It was the 24th straight month in
which inventories had risen.
   The 0.8 percent increase in sales followed a 0.4 percent sales
rise for November, as the rates of increase for inventories and
sales closely tracked one another.
   The similar increases in December produced no change in the ratio
of inventories to sales, which stood at 1.50, meaning it would take
1.5 months to exhaust inventories at the December sales pace.
   If not accompanied by rising sales, increasing inventories can
signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to
order production cuts and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods.
   December's sales gain was the biggest since a 1.3 percent
increase in October. It was pinned to a 2.4 percent increase at the
manufacturing level, which offset a 0.8 drop in sales by wholesalers
and a 0.1 drop in retail sales during the crucial holiday shopping
season.
   The government on Tuesday reported that retail sales in January
jumped a healthy 0.6 percent after the disappointing year-end
performance.
   December's increase in inventories was the biggest since a 1.1
percent jump in August. It was led by a 1.5 increase at the retail
level due to the year-end sales slowdown, while manufacturer
inventories climbed 0.7 percent and wholesale inventories rose 0.6
percent.
