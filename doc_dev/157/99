MELVIN DURSLAG: TENNIS HAS SEEN IT BEFORE -- FROM WOMEN 
</P>

As Pierre Baseline, your widely known authority on tennis fashion, we address 
the subject today of Andre Agassi in Paris and the skirmish in which he is 
engaged with tournament officials. 
</P>
<P>
It is the general consensus there that Andre is not dressing in a style 
befitting the French Open. Under shabby black shorts, he has been wearing hot 
lava tights. His hair is unkempt and he usually needs a shave. 
</P>
<P>
Folks at the French Open haven't yet decided how to describe Agassi, but while 
they are making up their minds, they would tell you he looks like a bum. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he does, the question is raised by Andre whether this is germane to 
playing tennis. Is it an athletic contest they are running, or are they showing 
the spring collection? 
</P>
<P>
Agassi isn't the first to challenge tennis propriety. Women have been doing it 
for decades, dating all the way back to Suzanne Lenglen in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
A daring French type, Suzanne was the first woman in big-time tennis to bare a 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, women players didn't wear bras. They bound themselves with 
material. Refusing to wear anything under her blouse, Suzanne raced for a ball 
one day -- and out popped one of her upper parts. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis was ready to drop dead. 
</P>
<P>
Then along comes Gussie Moran at Wimbledon, where a famed tennis couturier, Ted 
Tinling, designs for her some underpants trimmed in Belgique lace. It's as if 
someone sticks a finger in Wimbledon's tea. Shocked officials allow Gussie to 
stay in the tournament, but her pants are kicked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you decide to wear them?" we once asked Gussie. 
</P>
<P>
She shrugged. "It was a free pair of pants," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you know the gods would be offended?" 
</P>
<P>
"A woman's pants," she replied, "are her own business." 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, this is 1949. Those involved today in the feminist movement are 
reminded they didn't invent it. 
</P>
<P>
Well, a striking figure named Karol Fageros, tall, blonde, richly tanned, would 
then one-up Gussie. Karol appeared on the court in underpants of dazzling gold 
lame, soon to win her the billing of "Golden Goddess of Tennis." 
</P>
<P>
A signorina from Italy would follow with underpants trimmed in mink, a 
Brazilian would sport panties of bright cerise and an American would display 
sequins. 
</P>
<P>
For tennis, it was a spreading brush fire. The game didn't know which blaze to 
extinguish next. 
</P>
<P>
At West Side Tennis Club of Long Island, a seat of pomposity, a rule was 
instituted forbidding spaghetti straps, halter necklines and hip huggers. And 
if anyone developed the notion he or she could bare a navel, West Side reminded 
the peasant it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments over tournament attire then would generally vanish, reappearing five 
years ago at Wimbledon when a woman named Anne White turned up in a jogging 
suit, which she would peel off, revealing a white body stocking. 
</P>
<P>
Anne rose 5 feet 10 1/2 inches. However you cared to describe her construction, 
she was put together. Jaws of those viewing her in the body stocking dropped. 
</P>
<P>
At Wimbledon headquarters, the alarm sounded, as if someone were trying a 
break-in. Anne thought they were going to call Scotland Yard. 
</P>
<P>
"I was led to the office like a naughty little girl," she recalled. "The 
director told me, 'I must ask you not to wear that frock.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nor was her cause helped by her opponent, Pam Shriver, expressing disgust at 
such a broach of Wimbledon etiquette. White wanted to slug her. But afraid of 
being defaulted for improper dress, she abandoned the body stocking. 
</P>
<P>
So what kind of case do you make for Agassi, romping about in his hot lava 
tights, upsetting the chief of the French Tennis Federation, Monsieur Philippe 
Chatrier? 
</P>
<P>
A Parisian, appearing in threads bearing the unmistakable stamp of custom 
tailoring, Chatrier is an old tennis promoter who began working audiences about 
the time Jack Kramer did. Does Chatrier have a bona fide beef against Andre? 
</P>
<P>
It can be said in the Frenchman's behalf that other sports embrace dress codes 
-- football, baseball, basketball, hockey. Golfers are impeccable, mainly 
because they are selling the stuff they wear. 
</P>
<P>
To uplift their profession, once likened to pool, bowlers set forth a rigid 
code of dress, calling for "neat hair, neat shirt, neat pants -- no jeans." 
</P>
<P>
We ask the head of the PBA whether a guy is allowed to cuss if he rolls a 7-10 
split. 
</P>
<P>
"Only to himself," he answers. 
</P>
<P>
In cricket, you are asked to wear white, and hot lava pants are not permitted 
in soccer, much less polo. 
</P>
<P>
Do French tennis officials have the right to ask Andre to tidy up, or are his 
pants his own business, as they were Gussie's? 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins this argument is no affair of ours. We just don't want the kid to 
misinterpret looking like a vagrant for looking cool.
