   The Air Force has decided to convert a
mothballed $3.5 billion space shuttle dock into a backup pad for
launches of the Titan 4-Centaur rocket.
   The Pentagon said Friday the multimillion dollar conversion of
Space Launch Complex-6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base will start
after Oct. 1.
   The first launch of Titan 4 rockets equipped with Centaur
upper-stage boosters at the pad is expected in 1996, the Pentagon
said.
   The Air Force believes the pad is needed in case an accident
ever cripples Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex-4 East, which will
be used early next year for the first West Coast launch of a Titan
4 without a Centaur upper stage, Col. Charles F. Sterling, Titan 4
program director, said in a statement.
   Sterling cited the 1985 explosion of a Titan 34D rocket that
temporarily halted use of another launch pad.
   But a critic predicted the pad will never be used because
Congress will refuse to pay for the costly military communications
and surveillance satellites meant to be launched on Titan
4-Centaurs.
   ``They've been working on this launch pad for more than two
decades and it still hasn't launched anything,'' space policy
analyst John Pike said Friday by telephone from the Federation of
American Scientists, a public interest group in Washington. ``They
just want to keep pouring concrete.''
   The conversion of SLC-6 will cost $300 million to $500 million,
and will be faster, cheaper and environmently safer than building a
new launch complex for up to $800 million, said Maj. Tom Worsdale,
a Vandenberg spokesman.
   Pike said he believed the conversion will cost far more. He said
the decision ``effectively forecloses ever flying the shuttle from
California.''
   The cost of Titan 4 and Titan 4-Centaurs ranges from $173
million to $265 million each, according to various Air Force and
General Accounting Office estimates.
