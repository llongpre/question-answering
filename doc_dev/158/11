   Milo L. Pike said he has applied to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to increase his stake in Home Owners Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association's common stock to 24.9% from 9.9%. 
Mr. Pike said the Bank Board has informed him that consideration of the application has been delayed pending receipt of additional information. 

   Even if the application is approved, additional purchases by Mr. Pike may be subject to limits under Home Owners' charter. 
Any additional purchases would be for investment purposes, Mr. Pike said in a statement. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Home Owners fell 12.5 cents to $11.875. 

   As previously reported in a page-one story in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Pike, a New Hampshire investor, has been a key player in an ongoing tug of war between Home Owners shareholders and short-sellers, whose activity has driven the stock down in recent months. 

   Burlington, Mass.-based Home Owners couldn't be reached for comment on Mr. Pike's announcement, which was made after the market closed yesterday.
