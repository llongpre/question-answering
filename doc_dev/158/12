FT  13 OCT 93 / Observer: Pike landed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Thursday Francis Pike dropped in for a board meeting of Drayton Far
Eastern Trust, before heading to Chelsea register office to wed Lady Annabel
Goldsmith's daughter, India-Jane Birley. Pike's new boss, Philip Tose,
chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank Peregrine Securities, flew in
for the day to be best man.
Without further ado, Pike left for Bombay, where he has 10 weeks before
opening the doors of a joint venture between Peregrine and Indian tobacco
company ITC.
Pike had spent the last 14 years at fund managers Invesco, 24 per cent of
which is now held by Peregrine. When management upheavals at Invesco a year
ago made his position uncomfortable, Pike, who has spent much of his time in
the Far East, took a call from his old friend Tose.
Having created Hong Kong's largest independent merchant banking group in
under five years, Tose's ambitions now stretch to repeating the success
story throughout Asia.
With the help of close associate Li Ka-Shing, lack of capital is not one of
Tose's problems. Peregrine last year sunk Dollars 30m into South Korea in
another joint venture, with commodities giant Dongbang.
ITC, meanwhile, rejected several British merchant banks in favour of the
Asian partner for its foray into financial services.
An adaptable sort, 39-year-old Pike spent his first three months in Tokyo
living in a Zen Buddhist temple before getting stuck into what he calls the
'gaijin ghetto'. But he is far from unworldly, as his blue Ferrari, fondly
remembered by Japanese friends, demonstrated.
In taking on the still formidable difficulties of the Indian market, he will
not be stuck for more ways to make his mark.
