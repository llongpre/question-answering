<HEAD>Racial Slur Triggers Ouster Of Veteran Houston City Councilman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political unknown defeated veteran City
Councilman Jim Westmoreland, whose racial slur involving the late
U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland triggered protest.
   For an at-large seat on the 15-member council, Ms. Clark
attracted 142,026 votes, or 55 percent, to 116,244 or 45 percent for
Westmoreland.
   Westmoreland said on Oct. 18 that Houston Intercontinental
Airport should be called ``Nigger International'' to appease council
members pushing to rename the airport after Leland, the black
congressman killed in an Aug. 7 plane crash while aiding famine
victims in Ethiopia.
   Last week, council members approved a resolution censuring
Westmoreland for the comment.
   Ms. Clark, 34, is a minority recruiter for the University
Outreach Program, a partnership involving the University of Houston,
Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Texas. The tutoring
program helps Houston middle school and high school students
interested in attending college.

<DATELINE>EAST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Cardell Cooper easily won the
mayoral race and will succeed John C. Hatcher, who is under
indictment and did not run for a second term.
   Cooper, 37, the Essex County business administrator, got 11,587
votes on Tuesday vs. 1,064 for Republican Kyle Mann and 312 for
independent candidate Christine Keno. Mann had unofficially
withdrawn his candidacy in September but his name remained on the
ballot.
   Cooper, a former county freeholder, takes over this predominantly
Democratic city of 80,000 residents about 20 miles west of New York.
   Hatcher is under indictment on charges of official misconduct,
misappropriating city funds and violating state campaign laws. He
has pleaded innocent to the charges.

<NOTE>Zebulon, Ga., Mayor Denies Racial Intent in Registration Session</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ZEBULON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Ruth Chandler said she had no intention
of discriminating when she called white voters and invited them to
City Hall for an after-hours voter registration session.
   Tuesday's scheduled mayoral election was postponed after the
Justice Department launched an investigation of the meeting where
only white voters registered.
   The mayor and other Zebulon officials agreed to the postponement
and a series of steps, including reopening the voter registration
rolls, to assure that blacks are not subjected to discrimination. No
new date for the election has been set.
   Mrs. Chandler's black opponent, Lewis E. Mack Jr., 31, said he
thinks the registration session, which occurred Oct. 20, was an
effort to get out the white vote against him.
   The 42-year-old Mrs. Chandler, who is white, is seeking her
second term. She defeated Mack for the $50-a-month mayor's job in a
race decided by about 50 votes two years ago.

<NOTE>Twin Brothers Defeated in Salem City Council Race</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twin brothers Jean-Claude and Jean-Guy
Martineau went down in double defeat in their separate bids for City
Council.
   Jean-Guy, a City Council member for 12 years, vied for an
at-large seat, but he came in last in a field of six candidates on
Tuesday.
   Jean-Claude, running for the Ward 5 seat vacated by Jean-Guy,
received 626 votes, against 864 votes for David Goudreault.
   Jean-Claude, the younger by 10 minutes, had been living in
Florida, and returned to Salem six months ago.
   Before the election, he said he decided to get into politics
partly because his brother's constituents kept approaching him on
the street.

<NOTE>Mayor Masloff Runs Unopposed in Pittsburgh</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Sophie Masloff, who ran unopposed, became
the first woman elected mayor of Pittsburgh.
   She received the support of 38 percent of the city's 206,766
registered voters on Tuesday, a total of 56,480 votes.
   She was City Council president in May 1988 when Mayor Richard S.
Caliguiri died and she succeeded him. Mrs. Masloff, who calls
herself a ``Jewish grandmother,'' won a tough Democratic primary in
May against Allegheny County Controller Frank Lucchino, state Rep.
Tom M. Murphy Jr., attorney Byrd Brown and City Controller Tom
Flaherty.
   Murphy, who came in second in the Democratic primary, won rights
to the Republican nomination in a write-in vote but opted against
running.

<NOTE>`Capt. Tony' Elected Elected Mayor of Key West</NOTE>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anthony ``Capt. Tony'' Tarracino, the boat
captain, barkeep and storyteller extraordinaire, is Key West's new
mayor.
   The 73-year-old Tarracino defeated a former mayor, Tom Sawyer, by
32 votes _ 3,049 votes to 3,017 _ as he finally won Tuesday in his
sixth try for the office. In a campaign aimed at longtime residents,
Tarracino promised to slow development and gentrification of the
island city.
   He promised to be a goodwill ambassador for Key West who will
generate national publicity, but he warned that tourists may face
increased taxes as he tries to keep down Key West's cost of living.
   Tarracino recently sold ``Capt. Tony's'' saloon, but maintains an
apartment above the bar besides his home in Key Haven. He's known
for his tales, sometimes not 100 percent accurate, of gambling,
womanizing, and ferrying CIA agents and anti-Castro plotters into
Cuba and refugees out.

<NOTE>Nobody Shows Up To Vote In Rural Town</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PAHAQUARRY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Election workers had only
themselves for company in this rural community in northwestern New
Jersey as all eight registered voters sent in absentee ballots.
   State law requires every municipality to provide a polling place
to ensure everybody has a right to vote, so for 13 hours on Tuesday
the township's one polling spot stood vacant, except for the three
people sharing shifts, including Mayor Donald Von Hagen.
   Most of the township was bought up in the 1960s by the federal
government for its Tocks Island dam project. The project was never
finished and now most of the Warren County community is part of the
Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and Worthington State
Forest.
   Up for vote were two positions on the three-seat township
committee. No names were on the ballot and the 25-resident township
must wait until the absentee ballots are counted before they see who
the write-in winners are.
