   The state took control of Kentucky's
third-largest school district's finances Wednesday, citing a budget
deficit estimated by consultants to have been as high as $3.3
million.
   The action by the State Board of Education means state
Superintendent John Brock's written approval will be needed for all
hiring and purchases by the Pike County district, which has 15,250
students in 30 schools.
   The board acted after two consultants it sent into the
mountainous eastern Kentucky district reported dozens of management
problems.
   ``Beyond what we see in writing, there are unique political
problems in Pike County at the present time,'' Brock said.
   ``I think the (state board) would have to take some
extraordinary action at this time. ... I think they need some
help,'' Brock said.
   He said the state veto over local hiring would relieve the local
board of some political pressure to dole out school jobs _ pressure
that has increased as layoffs increase in the coal industry,
according to the report by consultants Arnold Oaken and James
Melton.
   Brock also said it ``would remove that temptation'' for school
board candidates to promise jobs for votes. Three of the board's
five members are up for re-election in November.
   The chief reason for the state board's action, however, was Pike
County's third straight year of running a deficit budget.
   On paper, it has been cut from $3.3 million to about $300,000,
but that is illusory, Melton and Oaken told the board.
   The district soon will have to borrow $600,000 to keep
operating, increasing the debt to near $1 million again, and the
purchase of new school buses can be delayed no longer, they said.
   The local board has voted to close one elementary school, but
the report by Oaken and Melton said five should be closed, with 780
pupils redistributed. In the past, when the county has built new
schools, it has declined to close old ones, Melton said.
   It was not immediately known how long the state would manage
Pike County schools' finances under the seldom-used statute it
invoked. The action is less severe than a declaration of ``academic
bankruptcy,'' by which the state would take over actual management
of the school system.
   Brock said he would place a lieutenant in Pike County to oversee
the school system's finances. Brock said he had a former school
superintendent, whom he would not identify, in mind for the job.
   In Pikeville, school board Chairman Alvin Newsome said he
welcomed the state takeover, and 18-year board veteran Gifford
Varney said he hoped the action marked a turning point for the
district. But two other members said they believed the takeover had
been unnecessary.
   If Pike County voters were unhappy with board members, they
could elect someone else to do the job, said board member Carl
Biliter. He said the state action surprised him, but added, ``We
don't have no say over it because we were in debt.''
