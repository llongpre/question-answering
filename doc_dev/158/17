   While a nearly all-male club is
making its annual New Year's Eve trek up 14,110-foot Pike's Peak, a
group of women will be making a 1,000-foot ascent of a nearby
mountain in jest of the traditional event.
   This year's climb will mark the 66th annual climb of Pike's Peak
by the AdAmAn club, which plans to set off fireworks at the summit.
The group adds a climber each year.
   AdaWoman, a band founded in 1982, will make an ascent on Pyramid
Mountain in Ute Pass west of Colorado Springs, light sparklers, play
Helen Reddy's song ``I Am Woman,'' down champagne and head home for
the night, organizers said.
   It will be the seventh climb for the AdaWoman club, which was
founded almost as a lark by Rita Randolph and several other woman
who train on Pyramid Mountain.
   ``It's really beautiful up there, and one morning we had run the
mountain and decided this was the way we should start out the new
year together,'' she said.
   The women also were prodded that year because AdAmAn, for the
first time in its history, was inviting a female guest, veteran
climber Sue Graham.
   ``One of the AdAmAn members said that the reason they hadn't done
it before was they didn't know any women who could make it,'' said
Randolph. ``Well, I and another of our members ran the Pikes Peak
Marathon, so I think we can make it.''
   AdAmAn historian Jim Bates said Graham, still the only woman
invited, will make her fourth climb with the club this year.
   ``Of course, when we started this climb in 1922, you couldn't
have hired a woman to go with us. It wasn't until a few years ago
that women got so they were into this type of thing,'' he said.
   Randolph said AdaWoman may add a man in 50 or 60 years, if one is
found worthy.

   City Council showed a little belated Christmas
spirit when it agreed to tear up 800 parking tickets issued Monday
to many car owners who thought it was a holiday.
   City Councilman Joe Giarrusso argued Thursday for giving auto
owners the benefit of the doubt. City Attorney Okla Jones countered
that the Streets Department had done nothing it wasn't authorized to
do.
   Several people cited for expired parking meters downtown and in
the tourist-loaded French Quarter said they thought the day after
Christmas was a ticket-free holiday.
   Jones said that Monday was a city government holiday not a public
holiday, which would have been ticket free.
   Streets director Betty Jo Everett said she gets tired of
defending the city holiday policy to irate drivers.
   ``We didn't gear up and lick our chops and think that we really
had something to go for,'' Everett said. ``It was just a normal
working day.''
