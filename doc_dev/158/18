   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space with a secret cargo during the weekend, and one
expert said it probably carried a pair of military communication
satellites into orbit.
   The 16-story-tall booster blasted off Sunday morning, said Air
Force Capt. John Sullivan, a spokesman for the sprawling Vandenberg
military base on the coast 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn't
announce the launch in advance and declined to identify its payload.
   However, it most likely carried two Satellite Data System
satellites, although it also might have carried either a KH-9 or
KH-11 photo reconnaissance satellite, said John Pike, a space policy
expert for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.
   Pike, who knew about the launch in advance, said Friday the data
system satellites are used for military communications.
   The satellites provide ``a way for the president to stay in touch
with our nuclear forces ... to give bombers and (silo-based crews
operating) missiles the `go code''' to launch nuclear warheads, he
said.
   Pike said two SDS satellites were ``launched five years ago.
They're due for replacement.''
   SDS and KH-series satellites are the only types launched from
Vandenberg on Titan 34Ds, he said.
   ``The reason I think it's SDS is I don't think the Air Force has
any more KH-9s or KH-11s,'' Pike said.
   The Titan 34D, America's most powerful space booster, will be
supplanted by the Titan 4, due for its maiden launch next year from
Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Cape Canaveral on Sept.
2, but sources told The Associated Press it failed to place its
payload in orbit.
   Pike described that payload as a satellite designed to monitor
Soviet missile tests and radio, telephone, radar and other
electronic communications.
   Two Titan 34Ds were launched successfully in late 1987. Before
then, they were grounded following two straight explosions during
launches on Aug. 28, 1985, and April 18, 1986, destroying a KH-11
and a KH-9.
