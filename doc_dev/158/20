   Firefighters mopped up a series of forest and
brush fires Sunday, but the danger of more blazes remained high
through a third straight day of record high temperatures and gusty
wind.
   Since Friday, six fires have broken out in the region from Pikes
Peak west of Colorado Springs to Boulder County northwest of
Denver. They were reported contained or near containment Sunday,
and had caused no injuries or structural damage.
   ``People haven't caught up with how tinder-dry things are,''
said Charlie Knight, fire information officer for the U.S. Forest
Service's Pike and San Isabel forest districts.
   Denver warmed to a record high again Sunday at 82 degrees. The
National Weather Service said the heat, coupled with strong
southwesterly wind and low humidity, made fire danger across the
state high to extreme.
   A blaze scorched about 20 acres just southwest of Denver, and
officials said visitors to nearby Mount Falcon State Park had been
asked to leave.
   An air tanker was dropping fire retardant on the blaze, said
Charlie Knight, fire information officer for the Pike National
Forest.
   Authorities said one fire _ a 600-acre brush fire in Denver that
was put out Saturday _ may have been caused by arson. The other
fires may have been caused by humans unintentionally, they said.
   The largest blaze, an 872-acre forest fire west of Monument,
broke out Friday and was 100 percent contained Sunday, Knight said.
   ``There is not even a wisp of smoke coming up now,'' he said.
   Some firefighters from that blaze were released to fight a
150-acre fire near Deckers. That fire began Saturday afternoon and
was 60 percent contained Sunday, forest service officials said.
   Smaller fires were reported in Mueller State Park, about 45
miles west of Colorado Springs, and in Boulder County's Left Hand
Canyon.
