TURNER Broadcasting System (TBS), the US cable television group that owns
CNN, is forming a joint venture in Russia to seek what it claims will be the
first independent television station in Moscow.
A memorandum of understanding has been signed by TBS and the Moscow
Independent Broadcasting Company, (MIBC), a private Russian company.
Mr Sidney Pike, president of CNN International's special projects division,
is in Moscow to represent Turner interests in the 50-50 project, which will
be broadcast free over the air. Revenues will come from advertising.
Mr Pike said yesterday the plan depended on obtaining local government
approval for a broadcasting licence to use Channel 6, an existing VHF
frequency. Russian authorities have indicated they plan to award the licence
within the next four months, Mr Pike added.
Under an interim licence MIBC and Turner have been broadcasting two hours of
CNN International, translated into Russian, every day on Channel 6 since
May. Mr Pike said the joint venture channel would include CNN news, classic
films, sport, entertainment and children's programmes, broadcast mostly in
Russian.
Channel 6 is the last VHF frequency available in Moscow. A formal contest
will be held to decide who should be given the licence. Siemens, the German
engineering group, and Russian partners are jointly developing plans to
equip nuclear reactors in the former Soviet bloc with western monitoring
technology for added safety, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The aim is to improve the safety of 1,000-megawatt VVER pressurised water
reactors, the most modern reactors produced in the former Soviet Union. The
technology would be based on existing Russian systems and advances under way
in Russia and be enriched with Siemens knowhow.
