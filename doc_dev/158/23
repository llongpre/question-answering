   At a Manhattan church this Sunday, that
commemorated Christmas pair, Mary and Joseph, will be portrayed in a
modern mode _ a homeless couple hunting for shelter.
   This has become the plight of hundreds of thousands of people
across America today, just as it was the plight of Mary and Joseph
2,000 years ago in Bethlehem.
   ``They also were homeless,'' says the Rev. Thomas F. Pike of
Calvary-St. George's Episcopal Church whose annual candlelight
service is presenting their situation as current rather than past.
   They, like many nowadays, ``had no place to stay,'' adds Pike,
who also heads the board of New York City's interfaith Partnership
for the Homeless. ``That family also was wandering the streets.
   ``They had to deliver the child in a backyard stable, a cave.
Then they faced persecution and had to flee. They had to leave for
another country. They were refugees.''
   In a similar way, he says the growing multitude of homeless
Americans is a ``crisis not just in the lives of individual victims,
but a crisis in the whole identification of this nation.''
   As chairman of an organization described as the nation's largest
private local program providing the homeless with food, shelter and
some permanent housing, Pike added in an interview:
   ``The growing callousness and willingness of people to live
side-by_side with this tragedy affects everyone. What we see is the
erosion of the worth of life, of the dignity of the human person.
   ``We see more and more tolerance of violence, a depreciation of
life. Our nation is really at a crossroads. If we don't resolve the
issue of homelessness, every cherished institution in American life
will be affected by cynicism and doubt.''
   Estimates have placed the number of U.S. homeless at up to 3
million, wandering the streets and byways of cities across the
country, crowding soup lines, hunting temporary shelter by night.
   Pike said President-Elect Bush's expressed hopes for a ``gentler,
quieter'' nation aren't likely ``if he doesn't listen to the cries
in the streets of the homeless.
   ``There's no way American society can be deaf and blind to this
crisis. Most people are hoping Bush provides leadership in dealing
with it.''
   Pike said that while the spreading severity of the problem may
represent the ``dark side'' of the picture, the massive volunteer
response to it represents the ``brighter side.''
   ``An incredible number of institutions are working on this
crisis,'' he said. ``Millions of volunteers of religious,
educational and philanthropic institutions are involved. It's a real
sign of hope.
   ``Literally every community and town on the face of this nation,
through individuals and groups, has mobilized support for hungry and
homeless people. If the President builds on that, we can have hope
that this terrible tragedy will be alleviated.''
   Pike, who estimates New York City's homeless at about 50,000,
said the inter-organizational partnership here has become a ``model
for places all over the country. Hundreds of them have picked it
up.''
   He said the ``the key to it is partnership,'' not only among
religious congregations, Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish, but
also with civic, labor and other organizations as well as city and
state agencies.
   ``We present a united response, cooperative and not
confrontational, that maximizes communication in dealing with the
system,'' he said.
   Pike, 51, who twice has been nominated unsuccessfully for
diocesan bishop _in Los Angeles and New York _ said that 400 New
York City churches and synagogues are involved in providing food and
shelter to the homeless.
   The congregations run 130 shelters that house about 2,000 people
per night _totalling 400,000 last winter with more than a million
meals served. About 24,000 volunteers have served in the program
since it began in 1982.
   It started then with only two churches _ Manhattan's St. Joseph's
Roman Catholic Church and Calvary-St. George's Episcopal Church, but
has since spread to a wide inter-religious network.
   Besides the sheltering and feeding program, the partnership also
runs a permanent housing operation, Project Domicile, which has
helped relocate 3,700 homeless people from shelters and welfare
hotels to permanent apartments.
   Pike, also a director of the New York Landmarks Conservancy that
helps fund restoration of historic sites, said a criticial need in
reducing homelessness is reform of the welfare system.
   It ``is not supportive of family life,'' he said. ``It ought to
support and encourage families to stay together and encourage
stability.''
   Under the circumstances, he said, ``Some of the most heroic
people in the country are women raising children.''
   Describing a sick, young woman with an eight-months-old infant
who fell into the subway tracks at Manhattan's Union Square and who
was lifted out just before a train roared in, he said:
   ``That's the New York Madonna.''
