   Milo L. Pike, a businessman in Tilton, N.H., said he acquired a 5.3% stake in Numerica Financial Corp.'s common shares outstanding. 

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Pike said he holds 234,500 Numerica common shares, including 187,000 shares purchased April 19 to June 18 for $11.375 to $13.625 each. 

   Mr. Pike said in the filing that he acquired his Numerica shares for investment purposes and may increase or decrease his holdings in the future, depending on market conditions.

He said it was for investment purposes and we have no reason to question that."
