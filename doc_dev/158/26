   More than 1,300 people swarmed into a hotel
to apply for about two dozen jobs at a coal mine this week, a
turnout a company official Thursday called a sad statement about
eastern Kentucky's economy.
   ``I'm pleased on one hand but it's kind of depressing on the
other,'' said Ed Stone, personnel director for Sidney Coal Co.
   Some applicants drove more than 100 miles to apply for the 19 to
25 jobs that should be available when Sidney Coal's mine in Pike
County reopens early next year, Stone said.
   Most of the applicants were unemployed miners from Pike County
and surrounding areas in Kentucky and West Virginia, Stone said.
   The new hires would help during a yearlong renovation of the
mine, which eventually might employ about 100 people, he said.
   The volume of applications was the largest for such a small
number of jobs Stone said he had seen in 19 years of work in the
coal industry. The positions pay a minimum of $11 per hour and
include full benefits.
   Stone said he had begun sorting through the stacks of
applications filled out Monday and Tuesday. ``I'm going to have a
very short holiday,'' he said of the task.
   Sidney Coal was a focus of a bitter three-year selective strike
by the United Mine Workers. A.T. Massey Coal Co., which owns Sidney
Coal, agreed in May to pay $4.47 million to settle a lawsuit with
the UMW.
   The settlement called for 35 union miners to go back to work for
a contractor. The strike began when two mines owned by Sidney Coal
were sold to Massey in 1984 and Massey announced the mines would
become non-union.
   Despite the past union problems, a number of the people who
showed up to apply for the openings were past or present UMW
members, including union workers laid off this year from the Scotts
Branch Mine in northern Pike County.
   The unemployment rate for Pike County was 12.1 percent in
October, according to the latest figures available.
   ``I wish we could help everybody, but unfortunately we can't,''
Stone said.
