   David F. LaRoche said he plans to apply to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for regulatory approval to increase his stake in Home Owners Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association to 24% from 9.9%. 

   Milo Pike, another investor with a 9.9% stake in the Burlington, Mass., thrift, already has filed an application seeking to raise his stake to 24.9%. 
The Bank Board has informed Mr. Pike, that consideration of his application has been delayed pending receipt of additional information. 

   Mr. LaRoche, a Providence, R.I.-based investor, said that his application doesn't affect his offer to buy some of Home Owners' assets, including its mortgage-servicing portfolio and some mortgage-related businesses, for $121 million. 

   Mr. LaRoche and Mr. Pike have been key players in an ongoing tug-of-war between Home Owners shareholders and short sellers. 

   Home Owners said it hadn't received a copy of Mr. LaRoche's proposed application and wouldn't comment until it has reviewed the application.
