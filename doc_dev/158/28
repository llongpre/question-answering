'BREAKING POINT' THRILLS IN HITCHCOCKIAN VEIN

An American intelligence officer, carrying vital knowledge about the Allies' 
planned invasion of Normandy, is captured and tortured by the Nazis. He wakes 
up in an American military hospital in Germany and learns the war has been over 
for two years.

<P>
Or has it? 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's TNT cable movie "Breaking Point," at 5 p.m. and again at 7, 9 and 11 
p.m., is an abundantly stylish remake of "36 Hours," the 1964 film with James 
Garner, Eva Marie Saint and Rod Taylor. Directed by Peter Markle and written by 
Stanley Greenberg, this suspense thriller in the Hitchcockian vein entangles 
both hero and audience in an intricate web of deception. 
</P>
<P>
Markle has cast his principal cast with care. Corbin Bernsen ("L.A. Law") is 
the bothered and bewildered amnesia victim, Maj. Jefferson Pike. His wife Diana 
is dead, he's told, but nurse Anna, a former inmate of Dachau -- or is she? -- 
hauntingly resembles her (exquisite Joanna Pacula plays both roles). Dr. Walter 
Gerber (John Glover), who seems to take Pike's case to heart, encourages Pike 
to cross the "psychological chasm" that blocks his memory by talking about what 
he last remembers: The plans for D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
Director of photography Don Burgess' moody lighting makes a major contribution 
to the film's pervasive, vaguely threatening atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
There are some lapses. The physical evidence offered to Pike as proof of the 
postwar date is too slight. It was more substantial in the original film. And 
just as the original's finale bogged down, Greenberg, Markle and the fine cast 
don't altogether carry it off here either, despite fundamental script changes. 
The climactic chase scene is wildly self-indulgent; it could have been lifted 
from countless action films. 
</P>
<P>
Still, getting there is delicious, beginning with the opening credits, which 
roll over stark, black-and-white World War II newsreel footage as Billie 
Holiday's sweet, mournful voice is heard singing in the background.
