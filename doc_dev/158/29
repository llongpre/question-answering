   The TNT movie ``Breaking Point'' is a remake
of the 1964 film ``36 Hours,'' starring James Garner and Eva Marie
Saint.
   The question is, why?
   Granted, the premise of the World War II thriller is intriguing _
the Nazis capture a U.S. intelligence officer and try to trick him
into thinking he's in a hospital suffering amnesia and the war is
over, so he'll reveal when and where the Allied invasion of Europe
is to take place.
   But it is certainly dated. And no matter how interesting the
premise, the story doesn't work if the viewers don't care what
happens to the characters. As weakly written as they are, they
aren't helped by a cast list that is an eery vision of
weeknight-on-the-dinner-theater-circuit.
   ``Breaking Point'' premieres tonight and is repeated Saturday and
Sunday.
   Corbin Bernsen, who does an admirable job of playing a crass,
shallow divorce lawyer on ``L.A. Law,'' would have been more
convincing as one of the Nazis. His Maj. Jefferson Pike comes off as
a vacuous dilettante who looks like he'd be much more comfortable
shopping for sweaters at Saks than plotting some nasty old invasion
of Normandy.
   The grinding wheels of the plot are set in motion when Pike goes
to an unexplained meeting with a unsavory character at a Lisbon bar,
drinks spiked espresso and is plucked off the sidewalk by the Nazis,
allowing director Peter Markle to ignore the plodding script for a
while and engage in some arty slo-mo and black-and-white photography.
   After a wee bit of electro-shock torture, which causes Pike to
grimace and perspire, he wakes up in a pleasant rest home surrounded
by seeming Yanks. The date on the newspaper is convincing enough,
but Pike is suspicious when everyone is vague on the identity of the
mayor of Chicago and who won the World Series.
   Joanna Pacula, who is making a career of TV World War II dramas
(``Crossings,'' ``Escape from Sobibor''), plays Anna, the German
nurse enlisted to entice Pike into spilling the beans, because she
looks exactly like the wife the Nazis have told him is dead. No
wonder she and his wife look alike. She plays both of them. If not
for this amazing circumstance, the rest of the story would have been
tragically lost to posterity.
   Pike, aided by the miracle of flashbacks, figures out the Nazi
game. He confirms his suspicions by tripping Anna up with a bit of
clever dialogue, something about a paper cut received recently in
London _ A-ha! We're supposed to be in occupied Germany! Understand,
this not exactly a battle of wits between two mental giants.
   Only the stalwart John Glover (``David'') inspires any interest,
playing Gerber, the Nazi doctor who hatches the brainwashing plot.
   As a potential footnote for the annals of bizarre casting, the
preppy-looking David Marshall Grant (``thirtysomething'') plays a
Nazi commandant. His presence must satisfy some behind-the-scenes
debt we aren't aware of. His only plot purpose seems to be to menace
the proceedings by expressing whining doubts about the validity of
Dr. Gerber's experiment. Not exactly the stuff of razor-edged
suspense.
   Unlike the 1964 film, ``Breaking Point'' ends with a cynical
twist, which might have played on a work of contemporary fiction,
but isn't particularly compelling as part of a historical drama.
Most viewers do know we won the war, don't they?
   Despite some wonderfully inane dialogue _ eg., Dr. Gerber: ``You
won't have to sleep with Major Pike again.'' Nurse Anna, with
straight face: ``Thank you, sir.'' _ the breaking point for most
viewers will come about 10 minutes into the film.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MORE PAGES FROM THE COS _ Bill Cosby, who has had more than
modest success with a series of books, as well as his television
series, is set to pen another collection of wit and wisdom, this one
on ``Childhood,'' scheduled for publication in the fall of 1991.
Cosby's three previous books, ``Fatherhood,'' ``Time Flies'' and the
most recent ``Love and Marriage,'' have all spent time on The New
York Times best-seller list. Cosby will change publishers this time,
from Doubleday to Putnam Berkley Group. He'll also try the big
screen next summer in ``Ghost Dad,'' directed by Sidney Poitier. ...
   BACK TO THE FUTURE _ ABC's Richard Threlkeld is departing later
this month for CBS, where he worked for 15 years before joining ABC
seven years ago. Threlkeld's wife, Betsy Aaron, is a correspondent
at CBS.
