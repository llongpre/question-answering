   It may sound like a childhood nightmare
come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions.
   But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry
officials say the lower Rio Grande Valley's grapefruit-size variety
known as the Texas 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for
more.
   At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the Valley
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion.
   ``They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass
and ship them UPS (United Parcel Service),'' said Dr. Leonard Pike,
a Texas A&amp;M University horticultural scientist who developed the
1015.
   Since 1974, Valley growers have helped fund $1 million in
research grants for the continuing project that Pike leads in the
quest for a sweeter, milder onion.
   He released his round, yellow Texas Grano 1015 _ named for the
optimum planting date of Oct. 15 _ in 1983, providing increasing
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from
Georgia, Hawaii's Maui Maui and California's Imperial Valley.
``Grano'' in the 1015's name means it is a round variety, as
opposed to flatter, ``Granex'' onions.
   ``It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating
onions that didn't eat them before,'' Dale DeBerry, owner of
Progreso Produce Co., said of the trend. ``You can see that by the
number of tourists who come by here asking for 1015s.''
   The sweet spring onions are available only for a six-week period
beginning in mid-April. DeBerry's company and others have started
labeling the 1015s with individual stickers to help consumers who
ask for them by name.
   ``Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I
know that sounds strange,'' said Paula Fouchek, executive director
of the Harlingen-based Texas Fresh Promotional Board, which is
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's
designer onions.
   ``There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,''
she said.
   About 80 percent of Texas' onion crop is the sweet spring
variety, said Erv Sandlin, a promotional marketing coordinator with
the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   Texas onion growers got $77.8 million for their crop last year,
making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said Doug
Bierstedt, with the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service.
   Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of
which 14,000 is for the spring crop, Bierstedt said. About 3,500
Texas acres are planted in the 1015.
   Texas' niche in the national market is that its South Texas
spring crop hits the market early, growers say. Until the spring
onions hit the market, consumers are eating the more pungent winter
storage variety grown in many states.
   ``We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about
gone and spring begins,'' said Othal Brand Sr., whose McAllen-based
Griffin &amp; Brand Inc. is the largest onion producer in Texas.
   On an early spring afternoon, Brand, who is mayor of McAllen,
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop.
   ``Isn't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the
bulbs up. ``The only thing prettier than that is money in the
bank.''
   Other Texas onions usually begin hitting the market before the
1015s are ready. The drawback from the spring crop grown in the
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage,
growers say.
   Pike said he is working on ways to store the spring onions
longer. He also is researching the source of the 1015's mildness,
which he said stems mainly from a low level of pyruvic acid, which
reacts with sulfur compounds to produce some of the unsavory
qualities in a more typical onion.
   ``Very rarely will you get one (1015) that will bring tears to
your eyes,'' Pike said.
   The 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said
Pike, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will
eat the mild ones of the spring season.
   Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been
reported at three pounds, according to Pike.
