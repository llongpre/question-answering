   A Pentagon research official said Friday that
the U.S. defense industrial base is being hurt by American
companies' increasing shift of research and development activities
overseas.
   ``I'm very concerned about the movement of research and
development offshore,'' said Craig I. Fields, deputy director for
research of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   Fields said that while companies may have made the ``right
business decision'' in the short run, such a trend is likely to
have an adverse impact on this country's long-term military and
economic capabilities.
   He also expressed concern about the ``increasing dependency of
the Defense Department on foreign components and technologies.''
   DARPA has sought to bolster U.S. capabilities by channeling
research funds into key technologies _ including advanced
semiconductors, supercomputers and so-called artificial
intelligence _ with both military and civilian applications.
   Fields, speaking at a conference sponsored by the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, said much more needs to
be done to coordinate U.S. longer-term defense research aims with
programs of civilian agencies such as the Commerce Department.
   ``It has to be a government-wide posture, not a defense posture
alone,'' he said.
   Jacques Gansler, a former Pentagon official, called for the
formulation of an overall ``defense industrial technology
strategy'' to guide military research and development efforts.
   Currently U.S. weapons ``are being designed so that they are
incredibly expensive and so complex that they won't work,'' said
Gansler, senior vice president of Analytic Sciences Corp., a
research company in suburban Arlington, Va.
   He said that with greater emphasis on manufacturing process
technology, the nation's defense industries should be able to
achieve higher quality production at lower cost.
   Also speaking at the conference was John Pike, associate
director for space policy of the Federation of American Scientists,
a Washington-based public interest group.
   Pike, a long-time critic of the Star Wars missile defense
effort, said that the program _ formally called the Strategic
Defense Initiative _ now appears to be firmly entrenched and on the
verge of demonstrating ``real technological results.''
   With the scaling-down of Star Wars goals from a complete nuclear
shield to defense of selected U.S. military targets, Pike said,
``at least we're dealing with a system whose cost and performance
goals are not obviously absurd.''
   Reagan announced the research effort in a televised speech in
March 1983. For the current fiscal year, $4.1 billion is provided
for SDI. Reagan's last budget requested an increase to $5.9 billion
for the 1990 fiscal year.
   ``Beginning this year we are going to start seeing real tests of
real hardware,'' including high-powered lasers, Pike said.
