   Higher prices are cropping up in
Florida restaurants, especially those offering vegetarian fare, in
the wake of the Christmas freeze that wiped out much of the state's
winter farms.
   A few restaurant owners say they've had to raise prices just to
break even.
   ``I'm a vegetarian restaurant, so I'm feeling more than a
pinch,'' said James McKenna, owner of the Ciao Sidewalk Cafe in
Delray Beach, 20 miles north.
   McKenna said a few weeks ago he was buying tomatoes for $8.50 a
case, but now he is paying $23. As a result, he raised the price of
the meal-sized salads at his cafe by 25 cents Thursday.
   The Taurus Steak House in Miami's Coconut Grove section has been
adding a $1.75 surcharge for their salad bar since the day after
Christmas because fo the higher vegetable prices, said Dave Hill
Jr., the restaurant's manager.
   At Ruby Tuesday chain restaurants, the prices have not changed,
but some days they've left cherry tomatoes and green peppers off
salads.
   ``We have not increased our prices, but we've had to delete a
few items,'' said Craig Marcy, a senior assistant at Ruby Tuesday
in Fort Lauderdale's Broward Mall.
   Most big restaurant chains are bearing the cost without changes.
   ``We're just absorbing the extra cost,'' said Cheri Grey of the
Steak &amp; Ale regional headquarters in Tampa. ``This is just short
term.''
   Prices fluctuate in any market and effect the restaurant
industry, said Frank Pike, chairman of the board of the Palm Beach
County Chapter of the Florida Restaurant Association.
   ``This happens in a multitude of categories _ beef, stone
crabs,'' Pike said. ``They can't change their prices every time the
market fluctuates.''
   Pike said it is too early to assess the impact of increased
vegetable costs on the restaurant industry as a whole.
