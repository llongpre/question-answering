   It may sound like a childhood nightmare
come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions.
   But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry
officials say the lower Rio Grande Valley's grapefruit-size variety
known as the Texas 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for
more.
   At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the Valley
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion.
   ``They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass
and ship them UPS (United Parcel Service),'' said Dr. Leonard Pike,
a Texas A&amp;M University horticultural scientist who developed the
1015.
   Since 1974, Valley growers have helped fund $1 million in
research grants for the continuing project Pike leads in the quest
for a sweeter, milder onion.
   He released his Texas Grano 1015 _ named for the optimum
planting date of Oct. 15 _ in 1983, providing increasing
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from
Georgia, Hawaii's Maui Maui and California's Imperial Valley.
``Grano'' in the 1015's name means it is a round variety, as
opposed to flatter, ``Granex'' onions.
   ``It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating
onions that didn't eat them before,'' said Dale DeBerry, owner of
Progreso Produce Co. ``You can see that by the number of tourists
who come by here asking for 1015s.''
   On a recent afternoon, a steady stream of winter Texans drove up
to his company near the border town of Progreso, but the round,
yellow 1015s weren't in yet.
   The sweet spring onions are only available for a six-week period
beginning in mid-April.
   DeBerry's company and others have started labeling the 1015s
with individual stickers to help consumers who ask for them by name.
   ``Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I
know that sounds strange,'' said Paula Fouchek, executive director
of the Harlingen-based Texas Fresh Promotional Board, which is
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's
designer onions.
   ``There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,''
she said.
   About 80 percent of Texas' onion crop is the sweet spring
variety, said Erv Sandlin, a promotional marketing coordinator with
the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   Onions last year brought $77.8 million to onion producers in
Texas, making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said
Doug Bierstedt, with the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service.
   Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of
which 14,000 is for the spring crop, Bierstedt said. About 3,500
Texas acres are planted in the 1015.
   Texas' niche in the national market is that its South Texas
spring crop hits the market early, growers say.
   ``We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about
gone and spring begins,'' said Othal Brand Sr., whose McAllen-based
Griffin &amp; Brand Inc. is the largest onion producer in Texas.
   Until the spring onions hit the market, consumers are eating the
more pungent winter storage onions grown in many states.
   On an early spring afternoon, Brand, who is mayor of McAllen,
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop.
   ``Isn't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the
bulbs up. ``The only thing prettier than that is money in the
bank.''
   Other Texas onions usually begin hitting the market before the
1015s are ready. The drawback from the spring crop grown in the
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage,
growers say.
   Pike said he is working on ways to store the spring onions
longer.
   He also is researching just what makes the 1015 mild, and said
it mainly is because of a low level of a substance known as pyruvic
acid, which reacts with sulfur compounds to cause the things that
give the vegetable a bad image.
   ``Very rarely will you get one that will bring tears to your
eyes,'' Pike said.
   The 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said
Pike, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will
eat the mild ones of the spring season.
   Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been
reported at three pounds, according to Pike.
   Bob Scarborough, who manages gift packages for Bartlett Groves
in McAllen, said his company started shipping the special boxes of
onions last year after shipping the more conventional gift citrus
for several years.
   ``As a matter of fact, I still have a little trouble with it
when you equate a package of onions with a gift package of oranges
or grapefruits,'' Scarborough said.
