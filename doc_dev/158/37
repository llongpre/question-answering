   A former police sergeant and a suspended officer
were convicted Wednesday of torturing a drug suspect with an
electric stun gun three years ago.
   In addition, a former officer was convicted of beating of the
man at his home, and a suspended lieutenant was found guilty of
abetting the beating.
   The defendants were among several police officers from the same
Queens precinct implicated in 1985 in the alleged torture of drug
suspects with the stun gun, which delivers a powerful, temporarily
disabling jolt of up to 40,000 volts.
   Everton Evelyn had testified that four officers beat him in his
home in 1985, and that two of them had later used a stun gun on him
at the station, holding him down and giving him shocks from the
hand-held device.
   The 34-year-old taxi driver testified that the stun gun was used
on his abdomen seven to 10 times for five seconds at a time. He has
also filed a $50 million lawsuit against the city and the Police
Department.
   Former Sgt. Richard Pike and suspended Officer Loren MacCary
were convicted of assault, official misconduct and coercion and
could receive up to seven years in prison.
   Jeffrey Gilbert, a former officer, was convicted of the same
charges in the beating. Suspended Lt. Steven Cheswick, who
supervised the other three, was convicted of official misconduct
and faces up to a year in jail.
   The jury had begun deliberating Monday afternoon.
   Pike was found guilty in both the beating and the stun gun
attack; MacCary was convicted in the stun gun attack; and Gilbert
was found guilty in the beating.
   Cheswick, prosecutors said, had blocked Evelyn's wife from
aiding her husband during the beating and had not tried to stop the
beating.
   The four defendants will be sentenced March 29.
   The trial was the second of four scheduled for officers of the
106th precinct who allegedly tortured suspects with stun guns in
1985. Pike and Gilbert already are serving two to six years for
their convictions in the first trial, in 1986.
