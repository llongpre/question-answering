   At most rodeos, the crowd cheers for the
cowboy to stay atop the bucking bull. Bobby Rowe cheers for the
bull.
   Rowe lavishes love and kindness on his bulls in hopes that a few
will grow into the ornery 1,500-pound rodeo demons that throw the
toughest cowboys.
   Rowe, a former world champion saddle bronc rider, is looking for
a commercial formula for raising bucking bulls on a farm near
Dickson.
   ``It's like you can take five men, give them a ditch to dig,
tell them to do it and four of them won't get it done,'' Rowe said.
``That's the same with bulls. Some buck and some won't. It's a
matter of heart and attitude.''
   Rowe raises the bulls on the 1,400-acre Highland Rim Farm, which
he has operated for three years for owner Henry McCall.
   Hooked on the rodeo since he was a teen-ager, Rowe has developed
an eye for good bucking bulls over the years. The trainer first
tests the animals with mechanical riders and sends those that
continue bucking to Maury, Ky., to work out with a rodeo team.
   After more tests at local events the best bulls travel the
national rodeo circuit.
   ``That's the ones I like,'' Rowe said. ``I'm looking for the
best.''

   Unpack your parkas and pull out your
shovels _ the woolly bear caterpillars here are pointing to a long,
cold, snowy winter.
   Springfield highway chief Philip Pike, who presides over a
$935,600 snow plowing budget, hauled out three woolly bear
caterpillars Tuesday and declared it's going to be touch and go
whether the city will have enough funds to clear the streets this
winter.
   Pike maintains that measuring the width of the orange stripe on
the caterpillars and the bushiness of squirel tails is as reliable
a system as any for the annual municipal guessing game of how much
money to keep in the snow plowing accounts.
   ``What the heck. We have some fun with it and I've got as good a
record as anyone,'' Pike said. Circumstances permitting, of course.
Pike made no prediction last year because he couldn't find any
caterpillars.
   On one of the three test caterpillars he unscientifically
scooped up last weekend, the orange band takes up nearly the whole
body. On the other two it is much larger than the brown.
   The wider the orange, the more snow, he allowed. And the
squirrels in city parks have such bushy tails it's certain to be
cold as well, he contended.

   Nick Ameli Sr., who has worked at the
Bluewell Fire Department for 40 years, apologizes that he isn't as
active a firefighter as he was some years ago.
   Ameli is 83.
   ``Mostly I direct traffic now and answer the phone. More often I
make sure the men have coffee and refreshments waiting when they
return to the station after a call,'' he said.
   After 24 years as a miner, Ameli moved to Bluewell, where he
became a firefighter. He was one of the founders of the Volunteer
Fire Department and after retirement became an equally busy
volunteer.
   Today, he is proud of the three generations of Amelis who are
volunteer firefighters.
   A plaque placed on the fire house honors Ameli for work he did
on the building, which was completed in 1969.
   ``They didn't have any money to pay me for the work so the
plaque was put up,'' Ameli said. ``It will last longer than the
money would have anyway.''
