<P>
No doubt you know that it bears the best-known name of any mountain in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
What you probably don't know, unless you've made the spectacular, winding trip 
to the top, is that the snow-capped massif called Pikes Peak also offers the 
most famous vista to be seen from any American mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Looking eastward from the summit of Pikes Peak, 14,110 feet above sea level, 
you see an endless expanse of spacious skies stretching over amber waves of 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
When you turn around and gaze west, you see purple mountain majesties above the 
fruited plain. And as you look over this scenic splendor, you know for certain 
that you have found America the beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
If those descriptive phrases sound familiar, they should. For it was here on 
the summit of Pikes Peak, in the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies just 20 
miles west of Colorado Springs, that a Wellesley College professor named 
Katharine Lee Bates was moved to write the poem that has become the national 
anthem of our nation's physical grandeur: "America the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed about America since the July day in 1893 when Bates traveled 
to the summit and was instantly inspired to create her moving hymn. Happily, 
though, the view from atop Pikes Peak has not changed much at all. 
</P>
<P>
All the wonders that sent Bates scrambling for pen and paper are still here to 
see. The rolling waves of grain fields to the east still glisten a deep amber 
beneath a mid-summer sun. And the imposing mountain majesties off to the west 
-- ridge after ridge of snowcapped ranges -- really do look purple against the 
dark blue Rocky Mountain sky. 
</P>
<P>
Thus if you're searching for a travel destination that will prove -- either to 
yourself or to your kids -- that this country is still America the beautiful, 
you can't go wrong by planning a trip to southern Colorado and a trek to the 
top of Pikes Peak. 
</P>
<P>
There were three ways to get to the top of the Peak when Bates made the trip: 
by foot, by train and by carriage. The same three ways are available today, 
except that the horse-drawn carriage that took Bates and her party up the Pikes 
Peak Highway has been replaced by the family car. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you choose to hike, the trip today is quick and relatively easy. A round 
trip on the Cog Railway that chugs up the mountain's east face takes three 
hours and 10 minutes, including a little less than an hour at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Driving the steep, winding 20-mile highway takes about an hour each way. Which 
means you will probably spend just half a day visiting America's most famous 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it hadn't been lucky enough to be given a memorably alliterative name, 
Pikes Peak would almost certainly have become a famous natural feature. This is 
a simple fact of geography. 
</P>
<P>
Pikes Peak is the easternmost of the "fourteeners" -- the elite category of 
American mountains reaching higher than 14,000 feet. As such, it was the first 
to be "discovered" when the white man began exploring the mountain west nearly 
two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Army lieutenant, Zebulon Montgomery Pike, was dispatched in 1806 to head 
an exploratory troop mapping the lower reaches of the Louisiana Purchase -- 
sort of a southern version of the Lewis and Clark expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Arkansas River west from the Mississippi, Pike and his men spent 
week after redundant week traversing the empty flatlands of the high plains. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Nov. 16, 1806, on an eastern Colorado meadow about 120 miles from the 
present city of Colorado Springs, Pike looked up to the west and saw "a small 
blue cloud." 
</P>
<P>
As they came closer, the soldiers gradually realized that this spot on the sky 
was really a massive, snow-draped mountain. Thanks to the prerogatives of rank, 
the peak was eventually named for the commanding officer of the troop that 
found it. 
</P>
<P>
That enormous mountain marks an abrupt shift in the topography of the 
continent. Here the flat, featureless meadowland of middle America gives way to 
the wrinkled spine of Rocky Mountains that make up the Continental Divide. 
</P>
<P>
And the change occurs with dramatic suddenness. With just a few low foothills 
before it, Pikes Peak juts up abruptly from the plains to scratch the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the nation's easternmost alp quickly became a powerful symbol of 
the rugged West -- "the most celebrated peak in America," as the Forest Service 
puts it. 
</P>
<P>
When the gold seekers of 1859 set out from Kansas City, their wagons were 
emblazoned with the famous slogan, "Pikes Peak or Bust." 
</P>
<P>
Over time, railroad interests created a resort city, Colorado Springs, at the 
base of the mountain to help draw tourists. Hiking trails, the cog railroad and 
a narrow carriage road were constructed on the mountain to carry visitors to 
the peak of the Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was only natural when Katharine Lee Bates arrived in the Springs to 
teach a summer school course at Colorado College -- one of her faculty 
colleagues that summer of '93 was a political scientist from Princeton named 
Woodrow Wilson -- that she should set aside a day to travel to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
When she alighted from her carriage at the top, Bates wrote later, she stood 
still for "an ecstatic moment" drinking in "the most glorious scenery I ever 
beheld." 
</P>
<P>
"As I was looking out over the sealike expanse of fertile country spreading 
away so far under those ample skies," Bates recalled afterward, "the opening 
lines of the hymn floated into my mind . . . Oh beautiful for spacious skies, 
for amber waves of grain. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Katharine Lee Bates (1859-1929) is well remembered in the environs of 
Pikes Peak. If you stop to visit the campus of Colorado College, a lovely green 
oasis near the heart of downtown Colorado Springs, you can see a mural honoring 
her poem in the school's Shove Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
And in the small gift shop/rest house at the top of the mountain, there's an 
author's holograph of "America the Beautiful" in Bates's own hand. 
</P>
<P>
If you're traveling from the West to Pikes Peak, you'll probably stop in Denver 
and then drive the 70 miles to Colorado Springs. If the sky is clear -- a rare 
occurrence in Denver these days -- you'll see the Peak poking its snowy face 
skyward due south of Denver airport as your plane comes in to land. 
</P>
<P>
Driving south along Interstate 25, you'll begin to get marvelous vistas of the 
majestic mountain about 20 miles out of Denver. For my money, the view from the 
north is the most dramatic way to see Pikes Peak. 
</P>
<P>
The great white mountain (it is snow-covered about 42 weeks of the year) 
hunkers there on the horizon like a great white whale, its long ridge rising 
gradually to the sharp peak. 
</P>
<P>
Just north of Colorado Springs, I-25 skirts the campus of the U.S. Air Force 
Academy, nestled in against the jagged hills of the Rampart Range on the 
eastern slope of the Rockies. There's a well-marked overlook here that offers a 
stunning view of the eastern face of the Peak, the face that Zebulon Pike first 
saw from his vantage point out on the plains. 
</P>
<P>
When you reach Colorado Springs, it's a 10-minute drive westward on Route 24 to 
the little tourist town of Manitou Springs, where most of the routes up Pikes 
Peak begin. 
</P>
<P>
Intrepid hikers might choose to trek to the top on the Barr Trail, a 
well-marked but extremely demanding hiking route laid out by Fred Barr from 
1914 to 1918. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Forest Service, thousands of people start the trip every year 
and a few hundred finish it. It's roughly 12 miles of hiking -- no technical 
climbing required -- with some incredibly steep sections and scores of 
switchbacks. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people turn back early, because the first four miles are quite tough, 
and down there below timberline there's not much view of the peak. Those hikers 
who make it all the way generally plan on a two-day round trip, with a stopover 
at Barr Camp, four miles and 4,000 feet below the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regular hikers are the members of Colorado Springs' Ad-Am-An (i.e., 
"add a man") Club. This fraternal organization adds one member each year. The 
neophyte must pass initiation by climbing to the top on New Year's Eve, when 
the club sets off an annual fireworks display that can be seen for 50 miles in 
all directions. 
</P>
<P>
Manitou Springs is the boarding point for the Pikes Peak Cog Railway, an 
electric train with two bright red cars that follow a surprisingly straight 
track to the top. Round-trip fare is $17 for adults, $8 for people between 5 
and 11 years old; preschoolers ride free. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular means of ascent these days is the Pikes Peak Highway, a 
serpentine 20-mile toll road that is paved for the first seven miles and then 
becomes reasonably smooth gravel. This is a steep and occasionally terrifying 
driving experience, but most two-wheel-drive family cars can make it. It's open 
from May to October each year. 
</P>
<P>
At the toll gate, you'll be charged $14 for a family of four. The rangers there 
offer driving tips: Don't use your air conditioning; it will make hard-working 
engines overheat. Stop now and then on the way down to let your brakes cool 
off. 
</P>
<P>
To enforce that last rule, there is frequently a policeman stationed about five 
miles below the summit to feel each car's wheels and warn motorists whose 
brakes are overheated. The best time to go is in the morning, because the 
summit can be hazy or completely fogged in on summer afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
The drive up Pikes Peak is one of the loveliest auto trips you can imagine, 
particularly above timberline (11,500 feet in Colorado), where the views seem 
to spread out forever and the mountainside becomes a vast white sea of snow. 
</P>
<P>
And then you reach the summit, bundle up against the nippy summer breeze, throw 
snowballs until your hands freeze solid and soak in the 360-degree splendor of 
the mountain view that you've been singing about since your school days. 
</P>
<P>
America! America! From this unequaled vantage point at the very roof of the 
Rockies, it is clear that God really has shed His grace on thee.
