   A hazing incident has led to the banishment
of a Stetson University fraternity that got into trouble over rape
allegations against several members last year.
   The Baptist-affiliated school announced Wednesday that it had
withdrawn recognition of Pi Kappa Alpha as a result of an
investigation that found members had degraded pledges, conducted a
public stunt and inflicted mental abuse.
   A Nov. 9 incident involving frat members, known as ``Pikes,'' in
the Ocala National Forest reflected poorly on the campus'
fraternith and sorority system, the university said in a statement.
It did not give details of the hazing.
   As a result of Stetson's action, Pi Kappa Alpha's national
office suspended the fraternity's charter, and the organization's
executive director said he will try to have the chapter kicked out.
   A fraternity member, the Stetson chapter, the national
organization and the university have been sued by a woman who told
investigators she was raped during a night of heavy drinking and
dancing at the Pike house in April 1988.
   The state attorney's office investigated the rape complaint
against two fraternity brothers. It found that they did have sexual
contact with the woman but said rape could not be proved.
   The woman's attorney, Sheldon Stevens, said additional
fraternity members would be added to the lawsuit before it goes to
trial.
   Four Pikes were suspended for one semester as a result of that
incident, and the fraternity was prohibited from participating in
social activities or sporting events.
   Steve Cox, Pi Kappa Alpha's national executive director, said
the Stetson chapter had been one category below a fully accredited
chapter since last spring.
   University officials will not elaborate on the school's actions
or make public the results of the investigation, said college
spokeswoman Jacqueline D. Kersh.
   The university defines hazing as ``any action taken or situation
created by the members of a fraternity intentionally, whether on or
off fraternity premises, to produce any physical or psychological
harm to the individual.''
