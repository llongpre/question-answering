   One hundred years after the Hatfield-McCoy
feud ended, West Virginia is embroiled in a polite debate on the
propriety of cashing in on the bloodshed.
   Guides at Chief Logan State Park led three-hour tours of Feudin'
Country during a weeklong festival that ended Sunday. The show
included films, slide shows, music and souvenirs.
   ``This part of the state doesn't have high mountains and
waterfalls, but we do have the most interesting history,'' said
Alvin Gale, a park ranger who leads the tours. ``It's not something
to be proud of, but it is history.''
   ``I guess things had to be settled one way or another,'' said
Liz Clay, 66, who went on one of the tours last week. ``That's
life, honey. To know what went on years ago.''
   At least 14 people died in the feud that pitted the McCoy clan
of Pike County, Ky., against the Hatfield clan of Logan County,
W.Va., part of which is now Mingo County.
   No one knows what prompted the bloodshed. Speculation centers on
a stolen hog and a Romeo-and-Juliet romance between two members of
the families. Whatever set it off, it took the intervention of the
governors of two states to bring peace in 1888.
   The tour covers five cemeteries, two dilapidated houses, one
battle site and some papaw bushes at the site where three McCoy
brothers were slain by the Hatfields.
   Only one Kentucky cemetery is included, and some Kentuckians
have half-jokingly accused the guides of slanting the tour toward
West Virginia. State officials say they left out Kentucky sites
because they were too far away.
   While many revel in the homespun notoriety, some historians
contend that reviving the Hatfield-McCoy feud perpetuates ugly
stereotypes of Appalachians.
   ``To me, it's very sad for this to be a commercial thing. It's
playing on a stereotype which I don't like,'' said Altina L.
Waller, a former history professor at West Virginia University
whose book, ``Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in
Appalachia, 1860-1900,'' recently was published by the University
of North Carolina press.
   ``On the other hand, it's sort of coming to terms with
history,'' Waller said.
   The publicity, which pops up frequently in national magazines
and newspapers, may hurt the area more than help it, said Ron
Eller, director of the Appalachian Center at the University of
Kentucky.
   ``There's probably been few other things in Appalachian history
that have reflected more of the negative stereotype as the
Hatfield-McCoy feud,'' Eller said. ``The national imagery is that
they were backwoods, isolated mountain farmers. In reality, they
were very important families who competed for land access that
would lead to economic development.''
   The tours in West Virginia are spurring some interest in Pike
County, where the Preservation Council of Pike County wants to
arrange similar tours. Sites would include the remnants of the
house where the stolen hog trial was held; the place where a
Hatfield supporter was hanged; and the grave of Randolph McCoy,
patriarch of the McCoy clan.
   ``Since it is an internationally known part of our heritage, we
need to capitalize on it,'' said Betsy Venters, the council's
president. ``It's something that the present generation wants to
know more about.''
   Pike County Judge-Executive Paul Patton isn't so sure.
   ``The Hatfield-McCoy feud is one thing that most people are
aware of. I guess people hold on to that as one thing that might
grow into a significant tourist industry,'' he said. But ``it
certainly might not promote the type of image we want.''
