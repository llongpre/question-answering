AS SPACE STATION PREPARES TO GO UP, FEARS GROW ABOUT IT COMING DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
NASA: THE AGENCY SAYS FAILURE IS 'HIGHLY UNLIKELY.' BUT ENGINEERS ARE STUDYING 
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN 'UNPLANNED RE-ENTRY.'

When things go NASA's way, what goes up doesn't necessarily come back down. 
</P>
<P>
With scores of satellites uneventfully orbiting Earth, the space agency's track 
record is hard to assail. Yet when things go wrong, the failures can be 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
During the 77-ton Skylab's fiery plunge in 1979, there was massive 
hand-wringing around the world. Luckily, the debris fell harmlessly into the 
Indian Ocean and Australia's outback. 
</P>
<P>
But what if something three times the size of Skylab -- or roughly the size of 
the U.S. Capitol building -- were to experience, in NASA's words, an 
"accidental inadvertent re-entry"? 
</P>
<P>
That the much-touted space station, scheduled to be completed within 10 years, 
could fall from the sky, damaging property and taking lives, has largely been 
obscured by the public fascination with its futuristic design and unquestioned 
central role in U.S. space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Now two recent reports have served to spotlight that scenario, one that NASA 
says is utterly remote. 
</P>
<P>
But one prominent space scientist says that simple arithmetic -- based on 
NASA's own numbers -- shows that there is a strong likelihood, not just a 
possibility, that the 500-foot, 290-ton space station could run out of the fuel 
it needs to maintain orbit, thus falling back to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
NASA, in a recently released draft environmental impact statement on the space 
station, said specifically that the chances of the facility ever falling are 
"highly unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
It nevertheless candidly acknowledged that there could be two types of 
"unplanned re-entries" -- controlled and uncontrolled. 
</P>
<P>
In a controlled re-entry, NASA said, the space station could be steered on a 
course of descent that would minimize any "resulting footprint" -- in other 
words, away from population centers. 
</P>
<P>
But an out-of-control space station "could produce a debris footprint at a 
random location," NASA conceded. Its environmental impact statement left the 
rest to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The $30-billion project is considered the steppingstone to the exploration of 
the moon, Mars, the rest of the solar system and beyond. Its construction, not 
yet under way, is expected to take about five years. It will be 1995 at the 
earliest before the first components are launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom -- the largest spacecraft ever assembled -- is being designed to 
spend no less than 30 years in orbit 150 to 270 miles above Earth at 18,000 
m.p.h., circumnavigating it every 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the current designs are to be thoroughly re-examined because of emerging 
concerns among some NASA engineers, expressed in a recent interim report, that 
the space station's intricate components may require extensive repair and 
maintenance in outer space long before astronauts have it fully assembled. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers said the space station could be only 60% to 70% complete before 
space-walking astronauts may have to turn from assembling it to performing 
inspections, maintenance and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"With any long, strung-out process of assembly, you're running a risk of 
components breaking down," said Charles R. Price, a NASA engineer the Johnson 
Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most difficult problems is to establish failure rate of components; 
that's predicting the future," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The potential flaws, involving solar power panels, various electronic devices 
and assorted structural components, also could require astronauts to spend 
dangerously large amounts of time working outside the space station, thus 
exposing themselves to excessive radiation and debris. 
</P>
<P>
NASA's environmental impact statement identified several possible causes for 
the space station or some of its components to plunge to Earth: 
</P>
<P>
* Failure of multiple and major on-board systems. 
</P>
<P>
* Collision with natural debris or with the space shuttle, which will ferry 
construction materials, astronauts and propellant fuel to the station. 
</P>
<P>
* Lack of sufficient propellant to stay in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Each scenario is "highly unlikely," NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from any structural damage or mechanical failures, the most likely 
cause of a space station plunge would be that it will run out of propellant, 
causing it to fall out of orbit, said John Pike, associate director for space 
policy at the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The space station is supposed to have sufficient fuel to maintain orbit for 180 
days, although current plans call for refueling every 73 days or so. 
</P>
<P>
But given such a large number of shuttle flights during the 30-year lifespan of 
the space station, Pike reasoned, another catastrophe like the 1986 Challenger 
explosion is inevitable -- a calculation based on NASA's own odds of such a 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
Another Challenger-like disaster, in turn, would lead to a prolonged grounding 
of all shuttles, thus making the refueling of the space station impossible, 
Pike said. He noted that on each of four occasions when the United States or 
the Soviet Union lost astronauts, manned spacecraft were grounded for more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
After the Challenger tragedy, the Department of Transportation asked NASA to 
assess the odds of a recurrence, and the space agency came up with a worst-case 
scenario of one explosion in every 78 launches and a best-case scenario of one 
in 200. 
</P>
<P>
Based on those projections, Pike said, "that would put it (the next accident) 
in the early next century." 
</P>
<P>
It would take 28 shuttle flights just to lift into orbit all the components of 
the space station. 
</P>
<P>
"Simple math is going to tell you that -- rather than extremely unlikely, as 
they describe it -- one would be surprisingly lucky if it didn't happen," Pike 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Hess, a NASA space station spokesman, warned against automatically 
assuming that the shuttle fleet would be grounded for extended time periods 
after another accident. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't necessarily follow," Hess said, adding that measures such as 
repositioning the space station or rearranging its solar panels could extend 
its orbital life by up to 200 more days. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, added Doyle McDonald, a NASA spacecraft engineer who directed the 
environmental impact statement, any precise calculations should be deferred 
until the space station's final design and configuration are known.

feet and weigh 290 tons, almost four times as large as Skylab, which fell in 
1979.
