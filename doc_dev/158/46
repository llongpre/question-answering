<P>
An ambitious plan to build a mini-city on the old Pike Amusement Park site 
picked up another important approval this week with the ease of a 
roller-coaster car sliding downhill. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council noted concerns about traffic congestion associated with the 
$1-billion development, expressed confidence that gridlock could be avoided and 
unanimously approved local coastal plan changes so the huge project can move 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Council members acted with enthusiasm, heaping praise on a development that is 
bigger and denser than anything ever built in this city of historically 
suburban sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Their comments were glowing as they approved changes that would more the double 
the site's maximum density and allow buildings up to 600 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a golden opportunity for this city," Councilwoman Jan C. Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good ol' days are about to come back," Councilman Les Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very delighted," Councilman Clarence Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ernie E. Kell said the project is exciting; Councilman Evan Anderson 
Braude called the development a big boost for downtown, and Councilman Jeffrey 
A. Kellogg repeated several times that he is very proud to be a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-building project of offices, residences, hotels and shops -- one of the 
largest urban coastal developments in the country -- still has several hurdles 
to clear. 
</P>
<P>
Plans must be approved by the California Coastal Commission. Then the city must 
approve a master site plan that spells out details of the development, which is 
be to built over 13 years, beginning in 1990, on acreage near the Hyatt Regency 
hotel and the Long Beach Convention Center, bounded by Shoreline Drive, Seaside 
Way, Pine Avenue and Queens Way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13-Acre Development 
</P>
<P>
While mentioning the possibility of traffic jams associated with the 13-acre 
development, the council seemed assured that city planners and developers would 
devise ways to handle the cars traveling to and from the seaside complex, which 
is expected to employ 8,000 people and generate 27,500 to 36,000 car trips a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Ratkovich -- whose Los Angeles company is developing the site in 
conjunction with a West Coast subsidiary of a company owned by developer James 
W. Rouse, who is known nationally for his shoreline developments -- said the 
project's traffic studies indicate that of 12 surrounding intersections, two 
would be pushed to unacceptable levels of congestion by the project. 
</P>
<P>
And those two, Alamitos Avenue and Ocean Boulevard and Alamitos and 7th Street, 
are already backed up at peak commuting hours, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Ratkovich also emphasized that the nature of the mixed-use project would cut 
down on car use, because people could walk from hotels and residences to shops 
and offices. 
</P>
<P>
"For Southern California, it is bold and unprecedented," Ratkovich said. "But 
it is a necessary step away from dependency on the automobile." 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director Robert Paternoster pointed out that the developers would 
be required to make traffic improvements, including installing traffic signals, 
upgrading intersections, extending some streets on the site, installing bus 
shelters and drawing up plans to encourage car-pooling and use of mass transit 
by office workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consulting Firm Hired 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, developers have agreed to whatever transportation-related development 
fees are imposed by the city when the transportation section of the General 
Plan is finished. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Paternoster said, city planners have hired a private 
consulting firm to design a computer model that will allow the city to simulate 
traffic problems associated with Pike and 11 other downtown developments that 
are under way or have been approved. The model will be used to find ways of 
routing the traffic to avoid traffic snarls. 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen for several organizations that had previously complained to the 
Planning Commission about future traffic nightmares downtown repeated their 
concerns to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Before approving the Pike project, city officials should have a much better 
idea of how they are going to handle the thousands of extra cars that the 
complex will draw, argued Marc Coleman of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Support Density 
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to forecast there may be a solution in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lamond of the Long Beach branch of the Sierra Club also said that while 
the project is in many ways admirable, his group cannot support the increased 
height and density limits, which would spawn a development that would 
contribute to air pollution and traffic tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Others criticized the project for not including housing for low- or 
moderate-income residents. In response, the developers said they want to design 
the 1,000 planned residences for a range of incomes. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that, of the $13 million a year the fully completed project is 
expected to generate in sales-tax revenue to the city, $1.8 million a year will 
be set aside for low-cost housing.
