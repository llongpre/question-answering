   The state Board of Education today voted
to take control of the finances of the debt-ridden Pike County
school system, citing widespread nepotism in Kentucky's
third-largest district.
   The action means that the 15,250-student school system cannot
make purchases or hire anyone without written approval from state
school Superintendent John Brock.
   The board acted after receiving a consultants' report detailing
dozens of management problems within the state's easternmost
county, a coal-mining area with 87,000 residents.
   ``Beyond what we see in writing, there are unique political
problems in Pike County at the present time,'' Brock said.
   The requirement that Brock approve all personnel actions will
relieve the five-member local board of political pressure to hire
friends and relatives of influential county residents, the state
superintendent said.
   Increased layoffs in the coal industry, the consultants said,
had resulted in greater pressure on local board members to hire
more people in the schools.
   In some schools, two-thirds to three-quarters of employees are
related by blood or marriage.
   The consultants' report said the district would begin a third
straight school year with a deficit budget. The district's debt,
which was about $2,000,000, is now about $500,000.
   The report said the district needs to control spending, close
several schools, reduce non-teaching staff and make an effort to
collect delinquent taxes.
   In May, the New Jersey education commissioner announced the
state intends to take over Jersey City's 32,000-student district,
under fire for a high dropout rate, political hiring and firing and
questionable finances.
   Besides Kentucky and New Jersey, South Carolina, Texas and New
Mexico have laws allowing state takeovers of failing school
districts.
   Laws in Illinois and Arkansas let the state eliminate deficient
districts. An Ohio law allows the state to revoke a troubled
district's charter. Georgia officials may impose heavy financial
penalties on such districts.
