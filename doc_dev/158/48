<HEAD>Treaty Questions Raised by Planned Anti-Missile Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Critics say a planned Star Wars test in the
South Pacific comes close to violating a 1972 treaty outlawing
major missile defenses.
   Near the middle of the month, a Boeing 767 equipped with a 3-ton
infrared sensor will make its first attempt to track a mock warhead
on an intercontinental ballistic missile fired from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif.
   The plane is scheduled to depart Boeing Field in Seattle on
Monday for a two-day trip to Kwajalein Atoll, an Army missile test
range in the Pacific.
   Anti-ballistic missile radar is prohibited by the 1972 ABM
Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   John Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American
Scientists and a Star Wars critic, said the aircraft ``appears to
be the functional equivalent of an ABM radar.''
   Pike said the Soviets may be justified in questioning whether
the airborne sensor is a treaty violation.
   ``If we saw the Russians doing this kind of thing, we would be
pretty bent out of shape about it, and if the Russians were giving
the explanation we are, we wouldn't believe them,'' Pike said.
   The Army says the airborne sensor is not a prototype for an
anti-missile sensor system. It also argues that the aircraft could
not substitute for an ABM radar because of technical limitations in
its infrared sensor and its on-board computers.

<HEAD>Administration Reiterates That 1973 Decision Should Be Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A new administration broadside aimed at
legalized abortion suggests pro-choice advocates have much to fear
from Supreme Court nominee David Souter, says the executive
director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   In a Supreme Court brief filed Friday, Solicitor General Kenneth
Starr defended Reagan administration regulations that prohibit
government-financed family planning clinics from providing abortion
counseling. The regulations promulgated by the Department of Health
and Human Services in 1988 have been challenged by family planning
clinics, Planned Parenthood and other organizations.
   The solicitor general said ``we continue to believe'' that Roe
vs. Wade was ``wrongly decided and should be overruled.''
   But he stopped short of asking the justices to do so in pending
cases involving New York City family planning clinics.
   ``This is direct evidence that there is reason to fear Judge
Souter,'' said Kate Michelman of NARAL. ``The administration must
feel confident they will soon have the votes to overturn Roe.''
   The clinics are financed under a $200 million-a-year program
under Title 10 of the Public Health Service Act. The law forbids
the clinics from performing abortions but earlier regulations had
allowed counselors to advise women that terminating a pregnancy was
an option.
   The court is considering two cases from New York City in which
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 1988 regulations
on a 2-1 vote. But some other federal appeals courts have ruled the
regulations were unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Want to Revive Windfall Profits Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil jolt from the Persian Gulf crisis is
renewing calls in Congress for a windfall profits tax.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., have
announced separate measures to restore the tax, which was repealed
in 1987.
   Kanjorski's measure directs the tax revenue to pay the
government's cost of insuring depositors of failed savings and
loans. He estimated that it would raise $15 billion annually.
   Like Packwood's bill, Kanjorski's measure would impose a tax of
up to 70 percent on excessive profits from oil sales. Packwood gave
no estimate of how much money his measure would raise, but he said
it would be based on the earlier tax.
   Both measures face stiff opposition from representatives of
oil-producing states. They say such a tax discourages exploration
and production at a time when the domestic industry should be
trying to grow.
