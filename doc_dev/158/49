<P>
As officials eagerly embrace a massive proposal to turn the old Pike Amusement 
Park site into the biggest single development ever built in this city, 
questions are emerging about the dramatic traffic increases that will accompany 
Pike and other planned downtown projects. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about future traffic woes proved the major reservation when the 
Planning Commission recently gave an impressively credentialed development team 
one of several key approvals needed to erect a mini-city by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most heated criticism cast on a development that has attracted 
profuse praise, a member of a citywide citizens' group warned planning 
commissioners last month that they were propelling the city into a traffic 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Problems Unclear 
</P>
<P>
"As things currently stand, the foreseeable impact of traffic over the next 10 
years in the downtown area is gridlock," contended Marc Coleman of Long Beach 
Area Citizens Involved. "I firmly believe that when the citizens of Long Beach 
understand the blank check that is being given to the Pike project through the 
lack of effective planning, a widespread outcry will develop." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, traffic officials concede downtown developments are being built before 
the city fully knows what new traffic problems they will breed or how to solve 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a good handle on the ultimate consequences of all the 
development that has been approved or is in the approval process," Richard 
Backus, the city traffic engineer, noted. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that their blueprints for turning Long Beach's sleepy 
downtown into a bustling urban center will bring thousands of additional cars 
to local streets, city officials say they are studying ways of coping with the 
traffic increases. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a problem, there will be a crisis if we don't do something about 
it now," acknowledged Robert Paternoster, the city's planning and building 
director, who said the city is by no means ignoring the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of escalating traffic, the city has hired a consulting firm to 
design a computer model to predict traffic tie-ups associated with new 
development throughout the city and to indicate ways of averting them. City 
planners are also requiring the Pike developers to devise programs encouraging 
car-pooling and use of mass transit by the 8,000 employees eventually expected 
to work in the project's office buildings, shops and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Densest Development 
</P>
<P>
Designed as the densest development in Long Beach, the 13-acre Pike complex of 
mid- and high-rises is characterized by large dimensions. More than 3 million 
square feet of office, residential and commercial space would be constructed in 
11 buildings lining the shore on what is now a largely empty expanse of asphalt 
south of Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The project, to be built over a 13-year period, represents 22% of the total 
office space planned for downtown, 19% of the hotel space, 8% of the 
residential space and 16% of the retail space. A quarter of downtown's ultimate 
work force would be employed there. 
</P>
<P>
Three garages would contain nearly 6,000 parking spaces. Drivers traveling to 
and from the Pike complex could make as many as 36,000 car trips a day, 
according to the proposal's environmental impact report, which predicted 
significant increases in auto-related air pollution and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Planning Commission by a 6-1 vote on March 30 approved zoning 
and local coastal plan changes that more than double the site's allowable 
density and increase the maximum building height by nearly 200 feet, to 600 
feet. Only Commissioner Elbert Segelhorst voted against the proposal, 
explaining that he liked the project but could not approve it before traffic 
concerns were dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council and the state Coastal Commission must still review the 
proposal, a venture of the Ratkovich Co. of Los Angeles and Enterprise 
Development West, a subsidiary of a company established by James Rouse, who is 
known for developing Columbia, Md., and popular waterfront complexes in 
Baltimore and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hart, Pike's project manager, said the environmental report's estimate of 
36,000 car trips a day "is truly a worse case analysis . . . and it is a scary 
number." The estimate exaggerates the amount of traffic that will likely be 
generated by the new community, he said, adding that his planners are trying to 
come up with a more realistic figure. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hart said, such a naked statistic ignores the economic and social 
benefits of creating a new urban hub in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
City traffic engineers say a more probable traffic figure for the Pike 
development is 27,500 car trips a day. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the Pike traffic count, it is only a part of downtown's long-term 
traffic picture. Another 11 developments have been approved or are under way in 
the downtown area, including the World Trade Center, Landmark Square and the 
McDonnell Douglas office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the city's Strategic Plan for the year 2000 predicted that if all the 
development plans for the port, downtown and the airport come to fruition, 
traffic leading to those areas would more than double. 
</P>
<P>
"God only knows what the solutions are," said Planning Commissioner Patricia 
Schauer, who prefaced her vote for the Pike project with complaints that the 
city should have had a transportation plan in place before moving ahead with 
such a massive development scheme. "I don't even know if there are solutions 
that are economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rush-Hour Bottlenecks 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Coleman, of Citizens Involved, said, there are rush-hour bottlenecks 
leading to downtown, such as at the intersection of Ocean Boulevard and 
Alamitos Avenue, "where I can state from personal observation, that many 
mornings, traffic is backed up . . . for eight-tenths of a mile all the way to 
Cherry Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
The city's 2000 plan noted several other congested areas in Long Beach, a 
number of them along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Paternoster, who said he has long advocated a traffic study but could not halt 
development until one is in place, said the computer traffic report should be 
completed in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Until the city gets a clearer idea of Long Beach's emerging traffic scenario, 
Backus said, the door is being left open to require developers to adopt traffic 
control measures once the full impact of their projects is gauged. 
</P>
<P>
While the light-rail system under construction between Los Angeles and Long 
Beach will take autos off Long Beach streets, Backus said, it probably will not 
improve the overall traffic situation in the city because the street-level rail 
line will slow the flow of cars. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-congestion measures thus far asked of the Pike developers -- 
subsidized mass transit passes, ride-sharing programs and the like -- are 
"nothing real innovative," Backus acknowledged, but, he said, such practices 
are not yet in widespread use in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The developers will also be required to install traffic signals and add turn 
lanes on some streets adjacent to the project, which will stretch from Pine 
Avenue to Queensway Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Hart mentioned other possibilities as well, such as establishing remote parking 
lots from which downtown employees could be shuttled, and starting some sort of 
a shuttle system along Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Hart dismissed complaints that the city has been too slow to plan for the 
anticipated jumps in traffic volume. But the Pike team several months ago 
joined other developers in launching their own study of how best to transport 
workers and visitors along Ocean Boulevard and across the bay to the Queen 
Mary, near which the Disney Co. is considering developing a major resort hotel. 
The developers have even talked of building a privately financed monorail.
