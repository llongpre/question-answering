<LEADPARA>  THIS turn-of-the-century Rocky Mountain town offers tourists easy access to an
extraordinary collection of natural wonders -- red rock formations, caverns,
mountains and mineral springs.;    Centuries ago, Ute, Arapahoe, Cheyenne and
other American Indian tribes considered the area sacred. Here, they laid down
their weapons and abandoned thoughts of war for religious ceremonies and
meditation -- and to drink and bathe in the waters flowing from the area's
dozen mineral springs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The town was founded during the late 1800s, when Victorian-era tourists
were partial to "taking the waters." The enterprising Army Gen. William J.
Palmer, founder of neighboring Colorado Springs, developed the region as a
health resort and spa.;    Manitou Springs has attracted a brisk tourist
business ever since.;    There are still 10 freely flowing mineral springs
within the town's borders -- each with its unique taste, particular mineral
content and attributed healing properties. Individual springs, it is said,
cure everything from arthritis to rheumatism, from dyspepsia to constipation.;
   The waters are free. Just go up to the tap with a cup or jug and fill 'er
up.;    Better yet, arrange with the local Chamber of Commerce for a free
one-hour tasting tour of the springs. While you stroll the quaint streets and
drink of the waters at Cheyenne, Twin, Wheeler, Soda and other springs, the
guide will regale you with local history and colorful anecdotes about the
town's founders and early residents.;    Be sure to visit Soda Spring, flowing
from a calcium-encrusted fountain in the center of the lobby of the town's spa
building at 934 Manitou Ave. The water is clear, cold and pleasantly bubbly,
with sodium, potassium, calcium and lithium among its contents.;    The
Spanish-style stucco spa, built as the Manitou Bath House at the turn of the
century, is now a hotel, where guests may spend the night and bathe in Soda
Spring's waters. The cost is $35 per night for two people, including
breakfast.;    Move over source Perrier!;    Ute Chief Spring, at 1311 Manitou
Ave., spews from the hands of a statue of an Indian chief. Cheyenne Spring is
in a red stone spring house, now being restored, at 934 Manitou Ave. Twin
Spring, with its tap outside a shop at 121 Ruxton Ave., is the preferred water
for lemonade.;    Of the natural wonders surrounding Manitou Springs, the most
famous is Pike's Peak, rising 14,110 feet on the eastern horizon.;    Although
this ranks only as the 32nd highest summit in Colorado, the ascent is
staggeringly steep. In 1808, explorer Zebulon Pike declared the peak
unclimbable. In 1820, Edwin James, set foot on the summit and proved him
wrong.;    Relatively few tourists managed to struggle up the mountain until
Zalmon Simmons, of Simmons mattress fame, built a railway to the summit. The
Manitou &amp; Pikes Peak Railway was completed in October 1890.;    West of town
is the Garden of the Gods, a splendid outcropping of gigantic red rock
formations. Manitou means "Great Spirit," and Native Americans believed this
place was created and inhabited by gods. Garden of the Gods Trading Post,
established 100 years ago, still sells authentic American Indian crafts.; If
