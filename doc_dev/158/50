   The News and Observer Publishing Co. will
offer its five South Carolina newspapers for sale.
   The newspapers affected are The Island Packet on Hilton Head
Island, S.C., The Beaufort Gazette in Beaufort, S.C., The Herald in
Rock Hill, S.C., the Yorkville Enquirer in York, S.C., and The
Clover Herald in Clover, S.C.
   Newspaper broker Lee Dirks &amp; Associates of Birmingham, Mich.,
will handle the transaction, the company said Monday.
   ``These papers are being offered for sale for two reasons,'' said
Frank Daniels Jr., president of The News and Observer Publishing Co.
``First, with the remarkable growth of North Carolina's Research
Triangle, we will be focusing on the core of the company's business,
The News and Observer, as well as our other North Carolina
publications. Second, stockholders of the company unanimously
decided on this action to receive some additional cash return on
their investment.''
   The Island Packet, purchased by The News and Observer in 1973, is
published five mornings a week and Sunday with a circulation of
11,000. The Beaufort Gazette is a five-day, afternoon daily with a
circulation of 9,000. The Herald of Rock Hill is published seven
days a week and has a circulation of 28,000. The Yorkville Enquirer
and The Clover Herald are weekly publications, and along with the
monthly Lake Wylie magazine, are divisions of The Herald.
   The News and Observer Publishing Co. will continue the following
publications in North Carolina: The News and Observer, The Raleigh
Times, The Cary News, The Smithfield Herald, the Zebulon Record, the
Gold Leaf Farmer in Wendell, The Ad-Pak of Raleigh and Wilmington,
the Mt. Olive Tribune, Benson Newspaper Printing, The Mountaineer in
Waynesville, The News Record in Marshall, The Enterprise in Canton
and the monthly Business North Carolina in Charlotte.
