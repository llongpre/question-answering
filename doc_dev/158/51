   Revelers rang in 1989 in celebrations ranging from the neon-lit
Times Square in New York City to small square-dance halls in Indiana
and a mountaintop in Colorado, some with champagne glasses, others
promoting abstinence.
   Millions watched the traditional New Year's countdown on
television as the 600-pound wrought-iron ball descended a pole at
Times Square. An estimated 600,000 saw the 81-year-old tradition in
person.
   ``We came here because we watched this on TV every year in
California, and one day I said, `We've got to go there one of these
years,'' said Claudia Zuniga-Mora, 23, of San Diego, who was
visiting friends in New Jersey.
   A 90-minute laser light show in the nation's largest city also
was part of the festivities.
   Many celebrated without such glitz.
   In Martinsville, Ind., three square dance clubs were to do-si-do
until 1 a.m. in the 4-H Building at the Morgan County Fairgrounds.
Betty Conover, president of the Flagtown Steppers, said about 200
people were expected. No alcohol was served.
   ``Square dancers do not drink and dance. You can't drink and
listen to the caller,'' Mrs. Conover said.
   Members of the AdAmAn Club of Colorado Springs, Colo., chose a
more solitary setting to toast 1989. They lit a fireworks display
from the top of Pikes Peak, elevation 14,100 feet.
   The group's 66th annual trek culminated at midnight with 60 giant
starbursts exploding over the snowcapped peak, where temperatures
dipped to about zero and hikers encountered 50 mph winds.
   ``It was difficult going above tree line where the snow depth
reached thigh level,'' said Jim Bates, who made his 34th climb..
   Music played a role in many celebrations. At the Grand Ballroom
in the New Orleans Sheraton, the music of the Guy Lombardo Orchestra
and swing were king.
   ``We're still playing the music Guy Lombardo played,'' said Kenny
Leighton, the leader of the Guy Lombardo Orchestra. ```The sweetest
music this side of heaven.' Isn't that corny? But it's true.''
   About 1,000 people had plans to dance 1988 away at a black-tie
affair at Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
   They were to step out to the theme of the Broadway musical
``Phantom of the Opera,'' said Mitchell Etess, a hotel spokesman.
   A group of New Jersey senior citizens also had partying in mind.
   Residents at the Jewish Geriatric Home in Cherry Hill planned a
New Year's party with the usual activities and even champagne.
   But the party was scheduled to last only until lights-out at 8
p.m., said spokesman Michael Bucci.
   An estimated 500,000 people jammed downtown Miami for the 55th
Annual King Orange Jamboree Parade to watch flashy floats, bands, 20
circus elephants and television stars such as George Wendt of
``Cheers'' and Susan Ruttan and Raymond Burr of ``LA Law.''
   In Boston, about a half million people wandered the city's
streets and public gardens as part of 13th annual First Night
celebration, which has inspired similar festivals in 23 cities from
Denver to Charlotte, N.C. More than 1,000 artists performed across
Boston.
   Many appreciated the event's no-drinking policy.
   ``We used to go out and misbehave like everyone else on New
Year's, but now we come to this as a family,'' said Joyce LaVecchia.
``I mean, why not? And there's no headache in the morning.''
   Drinking and driving, again, was an issue across the country.
   About 1,000 state troopers in New Jersey were on duty to
encourage motorists to stay at the 55 mph speed limit and reduce the
number of traffic accidents.
   Anheuser Busch Co. in Newark, N.J., offered free New Year's Eve
taxi rides home for about 3,000 drinking revelers in six northern
New Jersey counties, officials said.
   One group also moved to stop a dangerous New Year's Eve tradition
in Detroit.
   Save Our Sons and Daughters, which is made up of relatives and
friends of slain Detroit children, asked residents to end the city's
New Year's Eve skyward shooting spree.
   For several years, at midnight, some residents have shot guns in
the air.
   ``It's an insane practice, a part of the mores of this community
that needs to stop,'' said Fred Williams, a spokesman for the
Detroit Police Department.
   And in Philadelphia, one group eschewed making resolutions.
Instead, they issued predictions _ for last year.
   The Procastinators Club of America released its 1988 New Year
predictions Saturday, as usual when the year is ending.
   ``Somehow,'' said club president Les Waas added, ``we've never
been wrong.''
   The club's No. 1 prediction was that George Bush would be elected
president and then shoot quail over the Christmas holidays while
vacationing in Texas.
   ``That was a real shot in the dark but it was bull's eye,'' Waas
said.
