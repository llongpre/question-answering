   An attorney for an imprisoned Irish Republican
Army member argued Friday that the Justice Department overstepped
the law in its efforts to deport the man to Northern Ireland.
   The hearing before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was the
latest proceeding in Joe Doherty's highly publicized, 6{-year legal
battle to fight extradition and deportation.
   If he loses, Doherty could be returned to face life in prison
for the 1980 killing of a British army captain and a later prison
escape. Doherty, 34, has been imprisoned since his arrest at a
Manhattan bar in June 1983.
   The British government maintains Doherty is a common criminal
who should be extradited to face trial. He and his supporters
maintain he committed a political act not subject to extradition
and that he deserves political asylum; the IRA says it is fighting
to oust the British from Northern Ireland.
   Doherty has won decisions before two federal judges, a federal
appeals court, an immigration judge and three immigration appeals
boards.
   But in June 1988, Attorney General Edwin Meese III intervened
and ordered his deportation. Later, Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh overturned an immigration appeals board decision to
reopen Doherty's deportation case.
   The hearing Thursday stemmed from Doherty's appeal of the
rulings by Meese and Thornburgh. If his appeal is successful,
Doherty will be granted another round in immigration courts, this
time to apply for political asylum.
   As throughout his legal battle, emotions ran high at the
hearing. Doherty was not present, but the courtroom was filled with
his supporters.
   His attorney, Mary Pike, asserted that the attorneys general
improperly intervened in Doherty's case.
   ``What we see in this case is the naked manipulation of an
administrative proceeding,'' Pike told the three judges hearing the
appeal.
   She said the central issue was that ``the attorney general is
not above the law and that no individual, including my client, is
outside the law.''
   Pike also noted that 46 members of Congress had signed a brief
supporting Doherty's position.
   Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Noel Anne Ferris argued that the
appeal should be denied because Doherty had earlier conceded that
he is deportable and had waived his right to apply for political
asylum.
   Ferris also said Meese was correct in ruling that it was in the
interest of the U.S. government to deport Doherty. ``It was in our
interest as a country fighting terrorism to return'' Doherty, she
said.
   The three judges _ Wilfred Feinberg, George Pratt and Edward
Lumbard _ reserved decision and will issue a written opinion at a
later date.
