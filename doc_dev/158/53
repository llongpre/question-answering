FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Purchases boost Watts Blake

WATTS Blake Bearne, the clay producer where three large shareholders are
looking to sell their 45 per cent stake, yesterday announced a 28 per cent
profits increase helped by acquisitions in the US and Europe.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 5.67m to Pounds 7.25m in 1992. At the
interim stage, profits were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 3.74m.
Mr John Pike, managing director, said the figures were 'very pleasing. With
a sale of our shares in the balance, its nice to produce results rather
against the trend in our industry,' he said.
The three shareholders - Ceramics Holdings, Sibelco and Quarzwerke - are all
private companies controlled by overseas interests. They said the shares
were for sale in January. Since then no further announcements have been
made.
Mr Pike said the situation was unsatisfactory since the sale did not involve
the company.
Turnover increased 14 per cent to Pounds 69.8m (Pounds 61.4m) with all
markets except the UK recording stronger sales. In the US turnover doubled
because of acquisitions.
Watts uses average exchange rates and sterling's fall in value compared to
the D-Mark led to exchange rate gains of about Pounds 200,000. Exchange
rates should continue to help the company this year, Mr Pike said.
Watts, which is the world's largest supplier of ball clay, revalued its
mineral reserves during the year with the result that a surplus of Pounds
15.9m over book value was added to reserves.
Earnings increased by 22 per cent to 23.1p (18.9p). A final dividend of 8p
gives a total of 10.7p (9.3p), a 15 per cent advance.
The shares were unchanged at 445p.
COMMENT
Results ahead of expectations and a timely asset revaluation should raise
the asking price for the three shareholders' stake - if a buyer can be
found. One has to assume the three went public with their sale plans only
after failing to induce any buyers to come forward privately. Further, the
fact no one appears to have expressed interest since the shares were put on
the market two months ago suggests either the asking price is too high or no
one wants effective control of the company. Either way, the situation is
unhelpful for management and employees who are very much out of the loop.
For shareholders, however, there is no harm holding on. Forecast profits for
this year of Pounds 8m put the shares on just over 17 times. That is not
demanding given Watts' hold over its markets and the outside chance a bid
will eventually come through.
