THE Institution of Mechanical Engineers is planning to expand sharply its
links with industry in an attempt to make engineers more 'promotable' by
helping them develop their non-technical skills.
Dr Richard Pike, who took over as director-general of the 76,000-member
institution in September, wants it to work more closely with companies to
resolve a problem widely seen as contributing to the UK's manufacturing
decline - a shortage of well-rounded engineers.
The prevalence of engineers who lack wider financial, personnel or corporate
planning expertise is often blamed on excessive specialisation in
engineering courses at universities. But Dr Pike believes that engineering
institutions should bear some of the blame.
The institution is planning a two-pronged approach to expanding links with
UK industry. First, Dr Pike wants it to have contacts at a much higher level
than previously, so that senior corporate executives understand the
contribution which engineers with a broad range of skills can make.
He also wants to increase its industrial liaison officers - individual
members who act as a link between the institution and a company - from 300
to several thousand.
Meanwhile, the Engineering Employers' Federation moved yesterday to fill the
gap left by the surprise resignation of its director-general Mr Neil
Johnson, who will be leaving at the end of this month. Mr Graham Mackenzie,
president, will take on the additional role of chief executive from November
30. The federation said the arrangement would last for up to six months.
The forthcoming departure of Mr Johnson had threatened to leave the
federation without a leader during a crucial period of discussions with the
Confederation of British Industry over a possible link-up.
The federation said it remained fully committed to the talks, which will
continue - as will consultation on the link with the EEF associations and
member companies.
Numbers of apprentices recruited by the engineering industry are likely to
fall by 24 per cent this year, says the Sheffield Association of the
Engineering Employers' Federation.
The association, which covers the industry in South Yorkshire and the north
Midlands, says its annual survey shows numbers of craft apprenticeships have
dropped. But only 5 per cent of companies reported serious skill shortages.
However, engineering companies are taking on 26 per cent more graduates,
while recruitment of trainee technicians is unchanged. The trends are
thought to reflect the changing nature of engineering skills. Recruitment of
manual operative and clerical trainees has also fallen.
