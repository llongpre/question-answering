   Army scientists are readying a little-known
Star Wars test in the South Pacific that critics say brings the
anti-missile program close to violating a 1972 treaty outlawing
major missile defenses.
   Monday morning, a Boeing 767 equipped with a 3-ton infrared
sensor is scheduled to depart Boeing Field in Seattle for a two-day
trip to Kwajalein Atoll, an Army missile test range in the Pacific.
   Near the middle of the month _ the Army won't give the exact
date for security reasons _ the aircraft will make its first
attempt to track a mock warhead on an intercontinental ballistic
missile fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
   The ability to use sensors to track incoming missiles and to
distinguish between warheads and decoys is a key element of Star
Wars, which the Pentagon hopes will be ready for deployment within
a few years. The government has spent about $20 billion on Star
Wars since then-President Reagan launched the project in 1983.
   This month's Kwajalein test will be the start of an
``aggressive, intensive'' series of flight tests for the airborne
sensor over the coming 12 months, Col. Gary M. Stewart, who manages
the aircraft program at the Army's Strategic Defense Command
headquarters at Huntsville, Ala., said in an interview Friday.
   A key question in the debate over the aircraft, known as the
Airborne Optical Adjunct, is whether it could substitute for an
anti-ballistic missile radar, which is prohibited by the 1972 ABM
Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   The Pentagon says the aircraft is purely experimental and will
not be deployed as part of a Star Wars system.
   John Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American
Scientists and a Star Wars critic, said, ``It appears to be the
functional equivalent of an ABM radar.''
   Pike said the Soviets may be justified in questioning whether
the airborne sensor is a treaty violation.
   ``If we saw the Russians doing this kind of thing, we would be
pretty bent out of shape about it, and if the Russians were giving
the explanation we are, we wouldn't believe them,'' Pike said.
   Stewart said the Army is certain there is no treaty violation.
   ``We are totally treaty-compliant,'' he said. ``There are no
open issues'' to debate.
   The Army says the airborne sensor is not a prototype for an
anti-missile sensor system. It also argues that the aircraft could
not substitute for an ABM radar because of technical limitations in
its infrared sensor and its on-board computers.
   The aircraft's first flight was May 11, when it began a series
of tests to observe stars and track satellites. Stewart said those
tests, which were completed Aug. 28, went smoothly and set the
stage for the missile-tracking test at Kwajalein.
