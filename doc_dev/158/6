   It was part of what explorer Zebulon Pike in
1806 called the Great American Desert, the High Plains where grass
was the natural crop and buffaloes roamed far and wide.
   Pike's adventures along the Arkansas River to the Rocky
Mountains gave rise to a notion at the time that the huge region of
low rainfall, short grass and few natural water holes was a natural
barrier that would limit U.S. westward expansion.
   Farmers tried to tame it with the plow, but often drought and
crop failure dominated the huge region, generally west of the 100th
meridian. Dryland farming, the settlers found, was a precarious
business in the Great American Desert.
   It began to change after enterprising farmers tapped underground
water supplies for large-scale irrigation. A huge, invisible lake _
the Ogallala Aquifer _ was a gold mine for parts of Texas, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska.
   But for years the underground water level has been receding,
forcing deeper drilling and greater pumping costs. Already
irrigation has become uneconomical for many.
   ``In order to maintain a viable agricultural economy, this area
must return to a dryland type of production,'' says Agriculture
Department economist Wendell Holmes in the current issue of
Farmline magazine. ``How soon the transition will be made depends
somewhat on how willing farmers are to change their irrigation
practices.''
   Holmes said ``it seems reasonable to assume'' that some
irrigation will continue for a number of years. New technologies
and more drought-tolerant plants may help for a time.
   ``Whatever the time, though, adjustments must be made in order
to be ready when the wells run dry,'' he said.
   Holmes and a colleague, Mindy Petrulis, in the department's
Economic Research Service studied an area of the high plains in
West Texas, which included seven irrigated counties and eight
neighboring dryland counties.
   The irrigated counties included Castro, Crosby, Floyd, Hale,
Lamb, Parmer and Swisher, while the dryland counties were Baylor,
Cottle, Foard, Haskell, King, Knox, Stonewall and Throckmorton.
   Holmes said the irrigated counties enjoyed an economic boom in
the 1940s and 1950s as irrigation became widespread. A move to
``center pivot'' systems made it possible to nearly triple yields
of cotton, wheat and corn on land previously farmed without
irrigation.
   By 1960, the Texas high plains had become one of the most
irrigation-dependent areas of the United States.
   But the nearby dryland counties, which lie just to the east of
the Ogallala Aquifer, have never had enough water from surface or
below-ground sources to develop agriculture based on irrigation.
Holmes said that has been apparent from their economic performance
beginning in the 1940s.
   ``The economy of the dryland farming area continued to stagnate
and periodically worsen, because of the lack of water for crops,''
Holmes said. ``One effect has been a continued heavy outmigration
of rural people.''
   For example, between 1940 and 1984, the total population of the
dryland counties was cut in half and employment was reduced by a
fourth.
   In contrast, Holmes said, the irrigated counties experienced
rapid economic growth and development during most of the 1940-84
period. Despite a small decline in the last few decades, total
population in the mid-1980s exceeded 100,000 people, a 38 percent
increase from 1940, and employment at about 41,000 was up nearly 80
percent.
   Meanwhile, in the dryland counties that weren't blessed with an
abundance of water, farms grew larger and fewer in order to
maintain their incomes, and population dropped by 32 percent from
1940 to 1959.
   ``Dryland farming does not require a large labor force, nor can
it support a large rural or urban population,'' Holmes said.
``Thus, there was little inducement for people to move into the
area or, having been born there, to stay. More and more people
found employment elsewhere.''
   But by 1960, the fast-track development of the irrigated
counties slowed down. From 1959 to 1978, he said, the value of farm
products sold increased about 60 percent, compared with a tenfold
increase in the previous 19 years.
   And by 1978, almost 2,400 irrigation farmers had gone out of
business and 140,000 acres of cropland had been taken out of
irrigation. Rising costs of energy took a toll.
   The tough times continued among dryland farmers, too. Population
in those counties dropped by more than a fourth from 1959 to 1978,
total employment was down more than a tenth, and 31 percent of the
farm operators went out of business, Holmes said.
   In the 1980s, the financial situation for farmers across the
nation deepened as debt piled up, land values declined and interest
rates edged higher.
   Between 1978 and 1984, the total value of farm products sold
dropped 4 percent in the irrigated counties, while they increased
about 10 percent in the dryland area.
   Holmes said the population of the irrigated counties in 1978-84
declined about 3 percent, and total employment decreased for the
first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
   The trends were much different in the dryland counties. Farm
income rose 22 percent, compared with an 18 percent decline in the
irrigated counties.
   Holmes said that was because the proportion of total farm sales
from wheat in the dryland areas tripled from 1978 to 1984 because
of government price support programs. And dryland farm operations
cost much less.
   In fact, he said, per capita income in the dryland counties in
1984 was higher than it had ever been in the irrigated counties.
Unfortunately, the long decades of decline in the dryland counties
had resulted in a grim bottoming out.
   ``So many people have left that the economy has finally
stabilized, and most of those who remain are those with the jobs
that are still available,'' Holmes said.
