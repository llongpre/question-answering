FT  20 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Inner-cities deal stays, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR denied in the Commons yesterday that an inner-cities aid
programme had been cancelled. Challenged by Mr Peter Pike, Labour MP for
Burnley, about a letter from the Department of the Environment to local
councils warning them there would be no new projects under this programme,
the prime minister said Pounds 176m would be available for the urban
programme in 1993-94.
That money will be for projects already approved.
Mr Pike said cancellation of the programme, as a result of the
public-spending settlement, would cause 'despair and despondency'.
