   A Titan 4, America's newest, most
powerful rocket, blasted off on its maiden flight today, reportedly
sending into space a $180 million satellite designed to provide
instant alert of a missile attack.
   It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the
United States, with the $220 million rocket, a $45 million satellite
booster stage and other costs raising the total pricetag to close to
half a billion dollars.
   The 20-story-tall booster barreled off its launch pad at 9:18
a.m. and spewed a long tail of fire and smoke from its twin
solid-fuel boosters as it dashed out over the Atlantic Ocean.
   Ten minutes after liftoff, Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force
launch commentator, reported the rocket had successfully drilled its
secret payload into space.
   ``This is an important milestone for the Air Force because its
the first Titan 4, our new heavy lift launch booster, which will
give us assured access to space for our critical heavy national
security payloads,'' Rand said.
   The Titan 4 will be the workhorse as the Pentagon assembles a
stable of rockets to solve a post-Challenger crisis that has left
about 40 vital reconnaissance and other military payloads
languishing in storage for want of a launch vehicle.
   The Titan 4 can hoist 39,000-pound payloads to an orbit 150 to
300 miles high or propel 10,000-pound packages to stationary orbits
23,000 miles up. It replaces the Titan 34D booster, only one of
which remains to be launched.
   The United States once had a more powerful rocket, the Saturn 5
that launched Apollo astronauts to the moon, but it was discontinued
after the lunar program. It could send a 240,000-pound payload into
orbit.
   The space shuttle, by comparison, can lift 55,000 pounds into
orbit.
   The new Soviet Energia rocket, the world's largest rocket, has
nearly the power of the Saturn 5.
   The Air Force said only that the big rocket was boosting a
classified payload.
   However, it has been widely reported that the rocket carried an
advanced missile warning satellite.
   ``The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared
telescope to detect an all-out nuclear missile attack on the United
States within a minute of launch,'' said John Pike, associate
director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.
   This quick alert would give the president and military units 15
minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the Atlantic
or Pacific Oceans or 30 minutes for a land-based strike from within
Soviet borders, he said.
   ``That would give bombers enough time to become airborne, enough
time to mobilize our own nuclear forces and enough time to get the
president into an airborne command post,'' Pike said.
   The new satellite offers about the same warning time as older
ones, but without such errors as mistaking sunlight glinting off
clouds for missile exhaust, Pike said.
   The 2{-ton satellite also will provide intelligence on routine
Soviet and Chinese missile test firings and will be able to detect
the exhaust heat from military aircraft when they fly with their
afterburners on for extra speed.
   Pike said nine of the new satellites will be launched over the
next several years into orbits 22,300 miles high to replace aging,
earlier models.
   The first of the new rockets had waited a long time for its
maiden flight. It was moved to the launch pad more than a year ago,
on May 15, 1988, to be readied for a liftoff last October. But
technical problems caused delay after delay, stretching into months
and adding millions of dollars to the cost.
   Martin Marietta Denver Aerospace is building 23 Titan 4s for the
Air Force for $5.1 billion. The two are negotiating another contract
for an additional 26 rockets.
   Pentagon officials decided after Challenger exploded in 1986 that
they were relying too heavily on the space shuttle for vital
military payloads. They more than doubled the number of Titan 4s on
order and authorized development of two new smaller rockets, the
Delta 2 and Atlas 2.
   The first two Delta 2's launched navigation satellites in
February and on Saturday.
