THE epic account of the epic battle is a staple of fishing literature. These
descriptions are commonly variations on a standard theme: 'The rod bucked
like a wild horse in my hands . . . the reel screamed/shrieked/howled . . .
the fish leaped skyward, lit by the sun, like a bar of silver . . . the huge
tail lashed the water into foam . . . a final desperate bid for freedom . .
. '
This kind of thing becomes wearisome. The trouble is that, while the outcome
and the incidentals vary, one struggle with a big fish is pretty much like
another. The fish pulls. The angler pulls. The fish dashes around. The
angler dashes after it. One side or the other wins. If the angler loses, he
swears.
I would not deny that the fighting of the fish is an integral, thrilling
part of the sport. It stirs deep responses within us, and is the necessary
prelude to the glow of triumph or the bleakness of despair.
But the purest, most intense excitement precedes the fight, before the
angler does anything much beyond watching and waiting. It is the moment of
the take. And I would further suggest that, in its highest form, it must
engage the visual rather than just the tactile sense.
This is not to disparage the heart-stopping moment at which the salmon or
trout grabs the fly. But more often than not, this is merely felt, not seen.
It may be that, at that moment, you are concentrating hard on your fishing.
But you may, equally well, be ruminating on the excesses of the gutter press
or the wisdom of privatising the railways.
Contrast this with the responsibilities of the dry fly man addressing a
trout which is on the feed. He must cast, spot his fly, chart its progress
towards his quarry, and then, as the surface is broken and it vanishes, be
ready. If his mind wanders, he is lost. It is a sure bet that the moment he
starts pondering the issue of the female priesthood the fish will rise and
he will miss it.
But I sometimes feel that fishing with the humble float offers an even purer
pleasure. Pleasing in appearance, even more pleasing in disappearance is how
one writer expressed the joy of float fishing with exquisite pungency. Its
glory lies in the variations in the manner of that disappearance.
The float may tremble awhile, then move off with steady purpose before
slanting into the depths. It may do no more than dip. It may stir almost
imperceptibly, then glide away. It may bob for minutes, before being pulled
under. Or it may be jerked from sight without warning. The fisherman waits
and watches, shaking under the strain of powerful emotions.
These reflections came to me recently, as my favourite crimson-topped pike
float circled the backwater. It was a glorious day to be out, with a clean
breeze dispelling the internal fog bequeathed by seasonal piggishness.
The river, as if content to have turned most of the surrounding countryside
into a lake for the previous two months, had retreated within its banks for
the time being. But it was still running high and the backwater was the only
spot tranquil enough for my float.
Using an elderly carp rod and an antique centrepin reel, I lobbed float and
sprat towards the willow tree on the far side. They had travelled no more
than a couple of yards when the float stopped, vibrated for a second as if
conducting an electric current, and shot under. I could see the crimson tip
beneath the water, whizzing towards the willow, and I struck.
The rod bucked, the reel whined. No, after what I have said already, I had
better leave that bit out. Suffice it to say that after a stern contest, I
netted a magnificent small-headed, fat-bodied female pike; gawped at it;
thrust it into a keepnet; and ran off to the house to find witnesses.
Plastered in mud, dripping with pike slime and reeking of sprats, I hurtled
upstairs in search of the infinitely indulgent couple who let me have the
run of the place. 'I have caught a monster,' I bawled. 'You have got to come
and look at it.' They humoured me and came, and - I hope and believe - were
properly impressed by the creature's size and beauty.
I slipped it back alive into the weirpool and, with a flick of its tail, it
went off to resume terrorising the lesser species. One does not fish on
after such a triumph, so I went home, singing. The pike weighed 23 lb and
was, by half a pound, the biggest fish I have ever caught.
