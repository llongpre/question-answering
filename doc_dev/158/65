   Rumors that a satanic cult planned to
sacrifice a virgin reached a peak this week, leading people to keep
hundreds of children home from school and inundate police with
calls.
   Despite the hysteria, police and school officials said extensive
investigations didn't produce any evidence to support the rumors.
   Pike County residents locked their doors and kept children home
from school by the hundreds Thursday, the day the rumors said was
the intended date of human sacrifice.
   ``We have a 30 percent absenteeism in the district,'' McComb
Assistant School Superintendent Leslie Daniels said Thursday.
``Some of that is due to the weather; some of it is because it's
the day before a holiday. But from the calls we've had, I believe
much of it's from the rumors.''
   There are about 3,700 students in the district.
   Sheriff Robert Lawson has said in the past that there are 22
members of a satanic cult in Pike County and that the group has
probably sacrificed dogs, cats, goats and other animals in secluded
areas.
   Officials said the latest rumors led them to fear the public
might act irrationally if someone was identified _ even erroneously
_ as one of the cult members.
   ``As paranoid as this public is, some innocent person could get
hurt,'' said Lee Barkdull, McComb's acting director of public
safety. ``I'm worried about mischief _ someone spray-painting
something crazy and getting caught by others.''
   Since about March 24, Barkdull's office has fielded dozens of
calls from residents worried by reports that a cult planned human
sacrifices and that several McComb schoolchildren were on a list of
potential victims.
   Police believe the story spread quickly in schools, reaching a
crisis level when parents got wind of it.
   Students at Gibson High School said teachers canceled tests
Thursday when classes began with small numbers of students. They
also said rumors persisted that Satan worshipers planned a midnight
march through town, with a later sacrifice of a baby and a
13-year-old.
   ``The story is that Good Friday is their Black Sabbath, and they
need a sacrifice,'' said 16-year-old Tammy Perry, a 10th-grader at
Gibson High School.
   ``I figure it's a bunch of kids playing practical jokes,'' said
Terry Butrick of Summit.
   ``I believe people worship Satan. Why not? People worship their
car, why not Satan?'' said Butrick, who has two children in
elementary school. ``But as far as me running around getting out
the garlic and the silver bullets, nah.''
