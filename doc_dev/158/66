   The Pentagon disagrees with American scientists
who say their visit to a long-secret Soviet laser research center
convinces them the facility is not a threat to U.S. satellites.
   A Defense Department official said Wednesday that videotape taken
by the scientists of the Sary-Shagan laser facility in Soviet
Central Asia ``only firms up'' the department's view that the laser
facility is capable of incapacitating U.S. satellites.
   The scientists, however, said Wednesday their inspection of the
facility last week convinced them it poses no military threat. They
said the Pentagon had greatly exaggerated the facility's importance.
   ``This facility really hasn't had large resources devoted to it
since the 1970s,'' said Frank von Hippel of Princeton University,
one of the scientists who visited the site as part of a broader
inspection program sanctioned by the Soviet government.
   The scientists showed the videotapes at a news conference
Wednesday.
   No U.S. government officials were included in the visit.
   The Pentagon official, who asked that he not be identified, said
the Pentagon still believes that while the Sary-Shagan laser center
may be unable to knock a satellite out of space, it can do enough
damage to ``negate our satellite capabilities.''
   John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists told reporters
the Sary-Shagan laser is not powerful enough to shoot down
satellites or ballistic missiles.
   He said it was 100 to 1,000 times less powerful than an American
power laser at White Sands, N.M., that he called only marginally
capable of shooting down satellites.
   Pike was not on the tour but described for reporters his analysis
of the photographic and other evidence gathered by the tour group,
which also visited a Soviet nuclear weapons production center and
conducted radiation experiments on a nuclear-armed Soviet Navy
cruiser in the Black Sea.
   He noted the Pentagon, beginning in 1984, had described the laser
center as the heart of an ominous Soviet anti-satellite program with
ground-based lasers that could shoot down satellites and in the
future might be able to destroy ballistic missiles.
   ``It is clear that the threat posed by this facility has been
wildly exaggerated over the last several years,'' Pike said, adding
the U.S. claims represented either a major intelligence failure or a
deliberate effort to mislead the American public.
   Thomas Cochran, a staff scientist with the Natural Resources
Defense Council and a member of the tour group, said Bush
administration officials were invited to go along but declined.
   Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., who participated in the tour, said Soviet
willingness to allow Americans to inspect the previously secret
laser facility and other military installations was clear evidence
of ``extraordinary steps'' being taken by Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to promote the arms control process.
   Carr said Soviet officials told him during the tour that
legislation was being prepared to permit more public disclosures
about Soviet nuclear weapons production.
