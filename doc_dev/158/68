A proposal to turn the seashore site of a former amusement park into a 
sprawling complex of offices, residences and shops will go before the Long 
Beach Planning Commission this afternoon.

<P>
Pike project developers received approval for their 11-building proposal Monday 
from the Redevelopment Agency and are now seeking an amendment to the local 
coastal plan to allow construction of the mixed-use complex planned for the 
last large tract of privately owned land left in the city south of Ocean 
Boulevard.

Proposed for just south of downtown, the project calls for 3.3 million square 
feet of new construction, to be built in four phases, ending in year 2003.
