   A former FBI agent who solved a year-old
homicide by confessing to the crime pleaded guilty Tuesday to
strangling a pregnant informant with whom he'd been having an
affair. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.
   In a signed confession, Mark Putnam said he choked Susan Daniels
Smith, 27, on June 8, 1989, ``in an act of extreme rage'' while the
couple arued over support of her expected child.
   Putnam, 30, of Sunrise, Fla., entered a guilty plea to one count
of felony manslaughter in Ms. Smith's death.
   Immediately after the hearing, Putnam was handcuffed and taken
into custody by Kentucky State Police officers.
   It was apparently the first case in FBI history in which an
agent had been charged with a homicide, said Terry O'Connor, the
FBI's top agent in Kentucky.
   ``As far as the FBI is concerned, this is a difficult day ...
but I would hope that our entire record ... is what's going to
govern the way that people think about the FBI,'' O'Connor said.
   The victim's family expressed outrage they were not consulted in
the drafting of Putnam's plea bargain. They had wanted him to stand
trial for murder.
   The victim's sister, Shelby Ward of Freeburn, was cited for
trying to conceal a .38-caliber handgun in the courtroom by
Kentucky State Police, and was released.
   Putnam appeared tense during his 20-minute appearance in Pike
County Circuit Court.
   Putnam, who resigned Friday, worked in Pikeville for about two
years until his transfer to Miami in May 1989. He used Ms. Smith as
an informant in a bank robbery and car theft case.
   Putnam's confession was attached to an indictment returned
Tuesday by the Pike County grand jury. In the statement, he
recalled a bitter, violent argument with Ms. Smith about her
pregnancy. Putnam had returned to Pikeville for several days to
work a car theft case he had investigated.
   Ms. Smith ``kept telling me the baby was mine and that she was
going to `hang me' over this. She said she would tell the FBI, my
family and the newspapers,'' Putnam's statement said.
   The couple was driving on a rural eastern Kentucky highway at
the time and pulled off the road at Peter Creek Mountain. Putnam
said he and his wife would adopt the child but Ms. Smith refused,
and began slapping Putnam.
   The agent recalled that ``in an act of extreme rage ... I
started choking her and telling her to shut up.'' Putnam said he
tried in vain to revive her.
   He said he placed the body in the trunk of his rented car and
dumped it the following evening off an old coal mine road about
nine miles north of Pikeville.
   Prosecutor John Paul Runyon, the Pike County commonwealth's
attorney, said that without Putnam's June 4 confession, ``we had
absolutely no evidence. Not one scintilla or shred of evidence to
bring a charge or convict this man.''
   ``In the 28 years that I have been a prosecutor, this is the
first experience that I have had where a lawyer called me on a
telephone and said I have a man who wants to confess to murder, or
homicide, and wants to go to the penitentiary, and we had
absolutely no evidence,'' Runyon added.
