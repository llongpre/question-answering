FT  19 JUN 93 / Fishing: The venerable Venables

AS A CALLOW young man, I decided that my image as a fisherman needed a prop
to be rounded fully. So, I bought myself a pipe. The fact that my pipe and I
did not get on, and that it was discarded after one gruelling session of
match-striking, puffing, blowing, choking, poking and spitting, is beside
the point.
The point is that I wished to smoke a pipe because Mr Crabtree smoked a
pipe. He was never without it. Whether spinning for pike, float fishing for
roach or casting a fly for trout, there it was, clamped in a firm mouth
somewhere between square chin and clear, honest eyes.
Occasionally, he might take it out, to wet a knot or gesture at some
waterside phenomenon. But, most of the time, it was where it belonged, and
from its bowl issued a trail of smoke which seemed as essential an element
of the angling scene as his rod and reel.
I did not try to emulate other characteristics of Mr Crabtree's appearance:
his unchanging uniform of tweed suit, shirt and tie and battered, but
elegant, hat. Nor could I ever hope to match his prowess as an angler. He
never failed - literally - whereas I almost never succeeded.
Mr Crabtree and his son Peter (clad in shorts, jacket and tie but no hat)
inhabited an England of dreams: sylvan countryside running with clear
streams full of large, compliant fish. With their wicker creels, cane rods,
centrepin reels and homespun philosophies, they embodied a brighter, better,
simpler life that was all the more alluring for being so distant from
prosaic reality.
The spell cast by the duo was potent. They appeared first in strip cartoon
form in the Daily Mirror late in the 1940s. And their collected adventures,
published under the fine, old-fashioned title Mr Crabtree Goes Fishing, sold
more than 2m copies in the 1950s and a good few more when resurrected for
re-publication four or five years ago.
Their creator in those distant days was Bernard Venables, who has slipped in
and out of the angling world ever since. Now, after a long silence and aged
86, he has made a comeback with his Illustrated Memoirs of a Fisherman
(Merlin Unwin, Pounds 19.95).
Many years ago, I remember, Venables presented a series of programmes on
television called Anglers' Corner. I can see him now: jutting chin, wispy
beard and artistically windswept hair, consulting some weatherbeaten Kennet
ancient on the best spot for perch; then using tackle of the Crabtree school
to pull out three or four bristling stripeys, each of 2lb and more, and all
in quarter of an hour.
I did not know then that Venables had fathered my spiritual tutor, Mr
Crabtree; nor that he had founded what was then my weekly dose of
instruction, the Angling Times. But I did become aware of him through the
appearance and brief, glorious life of what remains, 25 years after its
death, the best fishing magazine ever produced in this country - Creel.
Creel reflected, in the range and variety of its coverage, the Catholic
tastes of Venables, who was its founder and first editor. I have all the
numbers with me now, and I still marvel at them. Flicking through the pages,
I roam from the Gulf of Mexico to the mountains of Slovenia, from Lake
Rudolf to the loughs of Ireland, from reed-fringed Norfolk broads to the
rocky torrents of Snowdonia.
Most of the great names are here: Reg Righyni on salmon, Clive Gammon on
bass, BB on catching a ferox, Fred Buller on pike, and Bernard Venables on
just about everything. His characteristically purplish prose and
full-blooded, naturalistic paintings are everywhere. The photography, the
writing, the presentation in the jargon and the production values of Creel
have never been matched. Not surprisingly, it went bust and Venables drifted
off the stage.
His new book is an indispensable document for anyone interested in the
development of fishing post-war. It is also a somewhat tantalising affair.
Venables jogs through the principal landmarks of a long career, leaving
enormous holes in the narrative and revealing little of himself. For my
taste, there are not enough fishing stories and the numerous paintings do
not seem as evocative as his work of yore.
Nevertheless, Merlin Unwin is to be congratulated for extracting this book
from a remarkable old man. And he has made his customarily handsome job of
it. For anyone interested in further exploration of the Venables oeuvre, I
would recommend back numbers of Creel, his best book, A Fisherman's
Testament - and, above all, the deathless Mr Crabtree.
