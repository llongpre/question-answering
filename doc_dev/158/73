TRW said Wednesday that a substantial reduction in funding on some of its 
classified military programs will force it to lay off about 200 to 300 workers 
at its Space &amp; Defense Sector in Redondo Beach, a signal that the 
Pentagon's "black" programs may be under increasing budget pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, many analysts and industry experts had presumed that secret programs 
would be less affected than conventional weapons programs by defense budget 
cuts, since secret programs typically support special military needs or 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
But that upbeat assessment is changing. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the tide has shifted and these intelligence and special access 
programs are going to be looked at more closely than they have been in the 
past," said John Pike, director of the space policy project at the Federation 
of American Scientists in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), a member of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, "has been hollering that we spend too much on satellites," said 
Pike, who estimates that the United States spends about $5 billion annually on 
intelligence satellites. That is more than is spent on tanks, strategic bombers 
or Star Wars. 
</P>
<P>
"The most expensive satellite, a Keyhole, costs about $2 billion, including 
launch costs -- and that's as much as an aircraft carrier," Pike said. "But it 
is a really good satellite." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed, rather than TRW, produces the Keyhole satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas-based Lockheed recently consolidated its Sunnyvale operations, which 
does a substantial amount of classified military work. Although the overall 
unit has posted higher sales and profits so far this year, it has had declines 
in "certain space system and defensive missile activities," according to 
Lockheed's third-quarter report. The operation anticipates making some moderate 
job reductions next year, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has 
been a strong champion of satellite programs and fought efforts to cut the 
nation's commitment to them, Pike said. But in a highly charged political 
environment to contain defense spending and with a conflict looming in the 
Middle East, spending on secret programs could be vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Costello, former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, said in an 
interview that the current Middle East crisis has forced Pentagon officials to 
look closely at expenditures in an effort to increase the direct support of 
U.S. combat forces. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are not going to cut the visible programs like the B-2 bomber, then 
somebody is going to take the (politically) easy route and cut the programs 
nobody can see," Costello, a senior researcher at the Hudson Institute, said. 
"With a constrained budget, it is the logical thing to do, but I think it is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Costello argues that a conventional arms treaty with the Soviet Union 
will increase rather than reduce the need for strategic reconnaissance systems, 
despite their high cost. "Surveillance activities have to be supported," he 
said.

Cleveland-based TRW said the greatest impact of its layoffs would fall on its 
Space &amp; Technology group, which produces satellites and other advanced 
technology products. The firm said it could give no indication of the type or 
scope of the work being reduced, but that it does not involve any of the firm's 
major unclassified satellite programs, such as the Milstar, Defense Support 
Program or Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. 
</P>
<P>
Among the firm's classified programs are believed to be a number of electronic 
surveillance and infrared spying satellites, as well as payloads for satellites 
produced by other contractors. 
</P>
<P>
TRW spokeswoman Julie Meier Wright said the company would attempt to find new 
jobs for some of the workers and that the actual layoffs might be somewhat 
smaller than currently estimated. The layoffs will not begin until early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
TRW's Space &amp; Defense Sector has eliminated 1,600 jobs nationally this 
year, including 950 in the Los Angeles area. The firm laid off about 500 of 
those workers; the balance of the jobs were eliminated through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1987, TRW employed 20,000 workers at its facilities in Redondo 
Beach and San Bernardino. The firm was forced to lay off 1,000 workers in 1987 
when a major secret program was cancelled. It currently employs 15,600 workers 
in the two locations.
