   Dozens of residents were stranded in remote
hollows as floods from the remnants of Hurricane Jerry wiped out
bridges and roads in eastern Kentucky, and officials feared more
rain could trigger flash floods.
   But in West Virginia on Wednesday, the high waters eased
hostility at least momentarily in the bitter United Mine Workers
coal strike: Strikers rescued three non-union coal company workers
whose van slid into a flooding creek.
   ``We really hate these guys, but we couldn't let them die,''
striking miner James Justice said Wednesday.
   Up to an inch of rain was expected in southeastern Kentucky
early today, renewing a flash-flood watch, the National Weather
Service said.
   In West Virginia, a half-inch fell Wednesday night, causing
flooding warnings for Mingo and Logan counties. The weather service
issued flash-flood watches today for 12 southern and eastern
counties.
   In both states, state disaster assessment teams toured flooded
areas on Wednesday and found hundreds of residents with homes
damaged by the flood, and many without safe drinking water.
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton visited hard-hit areas by car
after foul weather grounded his helicopter.
   In Davin, the governor found a man with mud in his home, garage
and furnace.
   ``I had been up deer hunting in Roane County and my wife called
and said the water was coming up,'' Bruce Belcher told him.
   In eastern Kentucky's Pike County, several hundred homes were
flooded, numerous bridges were washed out and 1,000 families
without drinking water, said Johnny Mike Blair, the county's
disaster and emergency services coordinator.
   Drinking water was to be distributed today.
   Pike County was one of seven counties that declared emergencies
and requested state aid after Tuesday's flood.
   Eighty percent of the roads and bridges in Letcher County were
damaged by the flood, said county Judge-Executive Reuben Watts, who
estimated the repair cost at $1.5 million.
   ``We've still got quite a few places where people can't get to
their homes and can't get out,'' said Mike Watts, the judge's son.
   Water damaged the homes of 200 people in Clay County and
drinking water was being brought to residents in the Big Creek
area, said Joe Jones, a county disaster service coordinator.
   ``We spent the entire day yesterday trying to rescue people,''
he said.
   Clay, Floyd, Letcher, Perry, Pike, Leslie and Knott counties
requested state emergency assistance. Kentucky Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson was awaiting reports from state disaster survey crews
before formally requesting federal assistance.
   Wilkinson signed an executive order Tuesday to declare a state
of emergency.
   In the rescue by the striking miners, witnesses said about eight
UMW men jumped out of their cars to help the three non-union
workers, who were stuck in rising waters of Rum Creek at Dehue,
W.Va.
   One of the workers, Rodney Walker of Cincinnati, was trapped
with his foot pinned in the van, said state police Trooper Ric
Robinson.
   The UMW men held Walker's head above the rising water while
waiting for emergency workers to arrive, said state police Sgt.
G.A. Ables.
   ``Without a doubt, had they not helped, he'd have died,'' Ables
said.
   Justice, one of the rescuers, is a Pittston Coal Group employee
who has been on strike since April. ``We don't want to see anyone
killed over this,'' he said. ``We just don't want anybody taking
our jobs.''
   The three workers were treated at a hospital for cuts and
bruises and released.
