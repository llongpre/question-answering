   John Tower could be the first Cabinet nominee
ever to stand on the Senate floor to answer questions from senators
face-to-face, an ordeal that reporters were known to undergo during
the 19th century.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole suggested the extraordinary
appearance Friday to give the embattled nominee for Defense
Secretary a chance to answer charges and questions about his
personal life. Democratic leaders said they would consider any
request.
   Associate Senate Historian Don Ritchie said no one has been
called to the Senate floor for questioning in more than 50 years,
and only five times that are listed in Senate records.
   Leaks of secret material to reporters were the target of early
grillings on the Senate floor and would be again if Dole gets his
way. Dole suggested Friday that Tower needed a chance to rebut the
allegations about his personal life that the Republican leader said
were based on biased leaks from the FBI report on Tower.
   The first recorded target of Senate questioning was William
Duane, editor of the Philadelphia Aurora newspaper. Ritchie said
that Duane had written stories about secret Senate deliberations on
changing the way electoral ballots were counted, stories based on
leaks from senators.
   But Ritchie said Duane left the chamber to talk to his lawyer,
fled the Capitol and never returned.
   Then in 1848 John Nugent of the New York Herald was questioned
about stories on secret Senate deliberations over a treaty. Thirteen
years later, Zebulon White and Hiram Ramsdale of the New York
Tribune were hauled before the senators, again to be asked about
leaks of secret treaty deliberations.
   ``No one revealed their sources,'' said Ritchie, adding that each
of the three reporters was held hostage in Senate committee rooms to
encourage them to cooperate.
   A more recent example _ cited by Dole _ came in 1933, when the
Senate Sergeant-at-Arms David Barry wrote a newspaper article some
members found objectionable. ``Not all senators are crooks,'' Barry
wrote, ``Just some of them.''
   The Senate historian said that Barry was questioned on the Senate
floor that February, grilled later by a Senate committee and then
fired.
   Then in 1934, three airline officials were called to answer
questions about government contracts with airmail carriers.
   As a former senator, Tower has the right to come to the floor of
the Senate, but does not normally have permission to speak to his
one-time colleagues.
   Non-senators have spoken on the Senate floor on other occasions,
including lawyers defending those charged in impeachment proceedings.
   The Senate can, of course, allow anyone to speak to them by
voting to do so.
