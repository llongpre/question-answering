<LEADPARA>  In a change that could save billions of dollars, NASA reluctantly is shelving
many of its plans for large spacecraft in favor of those that are relatively
small and simple.;   The seven-ton, 32-foot-long, $710 million satellite
launched Sunday morning by the space shuttle Discovery is the largest U.S.
craft ever built for monitoring the earth's environment, but it could be the
last of its kind.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The shift from bigness by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
is driven by tight budgets, advances in miniaturization and embarrassing
problems such as the mirror flaw that blurs the vision of the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope.;   Further, repeated problems with the shuttles that
deploy the large spacecraft have hastened a return to smaller craft launched
on unpiloted rockets.;   Under pressure from the White House, NASA already has
announced plans to cut the size of its Earth Observing System satellites and
to increase their number, from six to as many as 18, reducing the overall cost
and lessening the odds that one catastrophic failure will cripple the entire
research effort.;   The program, originally expected to cost $30 billion, now
is likely to cost about $5 billion less.;   And the space station, the
centerpiece of NASA's human exploration program, already has been scaled
back.;   Grudgingly, NASA also is planning to shrink other projects for the
late 1990s and the early 21st century, including lunar robots, Mars missions
and science satellites.;   "It's a dramatic change," said Dr. Lennard Fisk,
NASA's associate administrator for space science. "The plan in space science
over many years has been to have a major new start every year. Budget reality
says you can't afford to do that anymore, so the emphasis is shifting to more
small missions.";   James Thompson, the agency's deputy administrator, put it
bluntly, saying tight budgets will "temper our appetite.";   In the past five
years, the annual budget for NASA's space science program has doubled to $3
billion.;   John Pike, director of space policy for the Federation of American
Scientists, a private group in Washington, said the new approach was "the most
significant change in NASA's science program since the decision to go with the
shuttle 20 years ago.";   "They're basically aiming to do science without the
shuttle," Pike said.;   The new blueprint was hammered out in late July and
early August by about 60 NASA officials and national space experts who
gathered at Woods Hole, Mass.;   The recommendations have become the agency's
master plan. "It's a real sea change," Fisk said.  </TEXT>
