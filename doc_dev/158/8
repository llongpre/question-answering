   This town, population 945, will try for a
riverboat gambling license. So will Dubuque, with more than 60 times
as many people.
   ``I think there's a possibility of us getting a license, but I
think it's an uphill battle,'' said McGregor Chamber of Commerce
official Charlie Zahn. ``Personally speaking, I think it stinks.''
   The northeast Iowa communities, about 60 miles apart on the
Mississippi River, are two of the Iowa towns that plan to apply for
licenses from the state Racing and Gaming Commission following
approval of riverboat gambling in local referendums last week.
   There is no limit on the number of licenses that could be issued,
but observers expect no more than three _ some say only one _ will
be issued for the first year.
   On paper, Dubuque would appear to have an overwhelming edge. The
city boasts many tourism attractions, highlighted by Mississippi
River boat tours and the first dog track granted a parimutuel
license when gambling was legalized in Iowa four years ago.
   But McGregor officials concede nothing.
   Their own attractions include a 970-acre park named for Zebulon
Pike, a series of 191 preserved prehistoric Indian burial grounds,
and thousands of acres for hunting and camping. Officials felt
confident enough of obtaining a riverboat gambling license to hire a
contractor to build a boat dock for about $500,000.
   McGregor is a half-mile stretch of restaurants, antique shops,
taverns and other stores nestled between forested bluffs overlooking
the river.
   ``Being a smaller community, I think it's only fair that we
should have an opportunity like this, rather than everything going
to the big urban areas,'' said McGregor City Clerk Norm Lincoln.
   Dubuque has a different argument for the gaming commission.
   ``There is a point that's reached where there's too many people
in too small a geographic region all trying to do the same thing. I
think a full-fledged operation like we plan in Dubuque and a
full-bore operation very close to us, such as McGregor, might be a
little bit much,'' said Don Hess, a spokesman for the Dubuque Racing
Association, the non-profit group seeking a license.
   Hess, also director of marketing and communications at Dubuque
Greyhound Park, said five dog tracks are due to open in neighboring
Wisconsin, potentially cutting attendance and revenue in Iowa.
   ``We're hoping to secure a riverboat gambling license to get a
floating casino out on the Mississippi so we can have two major
tourism draws that will allow us to bring back some of these people
that we'll be losing to Wisconsin.''
   A floating casino could mean 300 jobs and an extra $100 million a
year to the local economy, Hess said.
   In McGregor, officials feel the state almost owes them a license
to compensate for lost taxes on thousand of acres around town
purchased by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
   ``McGregor's never going to land the big industry, and the
economics are such that we'll probably never see a dog track or
horse track,'' Mayor Robyn Denning said. ``We just never seem to get
our fair share of what's going on.''
