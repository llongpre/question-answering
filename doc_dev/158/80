   Chippewa Indians rejected a $35.6
million offer to give up traditional spearfishing practices that
anger sport fishermen, prompting one tribal leader to remark, ``The
Great Spirit won.''
   The Indians of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation voted 439-366
Wednesday night against a state of Wisconsin proposal to settle a
dispute over a 19th century treaty that gives the tribe rights to
fish, hunt and cut timber off their reservation.
   The settlement would have paid each member of the Lac du
Flambeau band $1,800 cash this year and $1,200 in each of the next
10 years. The $35.6 million, 10-year settlement offer included $15
million in state and federal aid for Indian programs.
   ``I feel great,'' said tribe member Scott Smith, who joined the
drum-pounding, cheering opponents of the treaty outside the center
where the votes were counted. ``They saved our rights.''
   The Chippewas' annual spearfishing forays, during the spring run
of walleye pike, have become the focus of protest by non-Indian
sport anglers. They say Indians spearing fish in shallow water have
an unfair advantage over others, who must use rod and reel.
   The battle heated up this year after the state announced it
would reduce walleye pike catch limits for sport anglers. The cut
followed a federal court ruling the Chippewa could catch up to 100
percent of the number of the pike which biologists determine can be
safely taken from the lakes.
   Demonstrations against spearfishing erupted last spring, and 200
were arrested.
   Gov. Tommy Thompson called the rejected settlement, which would
have required the approval of the Legislature, the best hope of
ending friction in northern Wisconsin.
   ``It's done, it's dead,'' Thompson said. ``It had to be ratified
by the tribe or it's done. ... We're going to have to review all of
our options.''
   Lac du Flambeau Chairman Mike Allen said before the vote that
the band wouldn't resume negotiations with the state if the tribe
defeated the referendum.
   ``That's the end of the trail here for us. It's over right now.
The people made their choice,'' Allen said today.
   He predicted that one consequence of the vote will be more
violent protests next spring when tribe members leave the
reservation to spearfish again.
   ``I believe it's going to get worse,'' he said. ``It's been
getting worse every year and we anticipate it for this (next)
year.''
   Tribal attorney James Jannetta announced he was resigning
because defeat of the settlement he negotiated was a clear message
his services were no longer wanted.
   ``The Great Spirit won over tonight,'' said Thomas Maulson, a
former tribal judge and leading opponent of the settlement.
   Federal courts have ruled since 1983 that the state's six
Chippewa bands retain the hunting, fishing and gathering rights
under 19th century treaties that ceded northern Wisconsin to the
federal government.
   The Lac du Flambeau, with about 2,500 members, is traditionally
the most active Chippewa band in spearfishing.
   So far, the state has failed to reach treaty rights settlements
with any of the Chippewa bands. The Mole Lake band rejected a
proposed settlement in January.
   Tribal council member Dave Vetterneck said after the vote: ``The
people spoke for what they wanted. As far as I'm concerned, there
will be no more negotiations.''
   Opponents of the agreement demonstrated outside the tribe
center, and security was tight as votes were cast, but there were
no disturbances.
