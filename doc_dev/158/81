   That long, zigzag road of trying to achieve
greater unity among a big swath of American Protestantism has passed
another milestone, taking a new route toward the goal.
   It no longer intends structural merger _ as was originally
contemplated and which has proved the typical bottleneck to unifying
churches _ but nevertheless aims at functional cohesion.
   This time, ``I think it's going to fly,'' says the Rev. David W.
A. Taylor of Princeton, N.J., general secretary of the Consultation
on Church Union. ``After 26 years of work, we've now got a plan
before the churches.''
   Taylor, a Presbyterian, said in a telephone interview that the
plan is ``workable and realistic'' and he predicted the involved
denominations will approve it. ``No question about it, I fully
believe they will.''
   The plan was recommended unanimously at a meeting early this
month in New Orleans of the consultation, involving about 200
representatives of nine denominations totalling more than 22 million
members.
   ``This is the time we have been working and praying for,'' said
the Rev. Gerald F. Moede, a United Methodist pastor in Adell, Wis.
As the consultation's former general secretary, he was a chief
architect of the plan.
   It is termed ``covenanting'' and envisages mutual recognition by
the denominations of one another's baptism, membership and clergy,
allowing intercommunion and joint ministry, mission and service.
   Moede called the plan a ``biblical format to bring Christians
together sociologically and theologically to meet today's needs and
those of the future.''
   It doesn't necessitate overhauling and meshing organizational
structures _ usually blocked by power rivalries _ but continues the
present structures, providing for working partnership and mutual
interflow of personnel.
   ``What we have been seeking since the beginning is not uniformity
but unity in things that really matter, like membership and ministry
and mission,'' said the Rev. George H. Pike of Louisville, Ky., a
Presbyterian.
   ``We are not, and never have been, seeking a monolithic
institution.''
   However, the consultation previously had recommended a plan of
structural union, but that 1970 plan soon was dropped after it ran
into widespread denominational opposition.
   That setback followed eight years of work by the consultation,
which was launched in 1962 after the late Presbyterian leader Eugene
Carson Blake urged a unified church that was catholic, reformed and
evangelical.
   Seconded by the late Episcopal Bishop James Pike, Blake's
proposal at an assembly of the National Council of Churches
unleashed an ensuing tide of support _ and sparked formation of the
consultation.
   The nine denominations participating in it are the United
Methodist, Episcopal and Presbyterian churches, the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), United Church of Christ, International
Council of Community Churches and three predominantly black
Methodist denominations.
   They are the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and Christian Methodist Episcopal
Church.
   After the plan for structural merger collapsed, the consultation
took a new tack, working on a theological consensus, with an
agreement reached on it in 1984.
   Six of the nine denominations have accepted the theological
agreement as a basis for the next step toward an operational
covenant, and two denominations _ the U.C.C. and Christian Churches
_ still are to act on the agreement in 1989.
   The ninth denomination, the Episcopal Church, at its 1988
convention commended parts of the agreement, but said some points
needed clarified to make it the basis for covnenanting acts.
   That reworking, done by a drafting committee headed by the Rev.
Paul A. Crow Jr. of Indianapolis, the Christian Church's ecumenical
officer, was the document unanimously approved by the New Orleans
meeting.
   Pike, the consultation's outgoing president, called the approval
a ``historic moment.''
   United Methodist Bishop William Boyd Grove of Charleston, W.Va.,
commented, ``We are on the threshold of a new Pentecostal experience
of the unity of the church.''
   Crow said his committee had received more than 150 suggested
changes reflecting ``a lot of passion and a lot of substance'' and
that about 80 percent of them were included in the revised and
unanimously endorsed plan.
   Denominational legislative assemblies were were asked to approve
it as ``the definitive agreement for joining with other
participating churches in covenant communion.''
   Action by the nine churches is not expected to be complete before
the mid-1990s, since conventions of the denominations are held at
varying intervals.
   African Methodist Episcopal Bishop Vinton R. Anderson of St.
Louis was elected president of the consultation, succeeding Pike.
   Taylor, who replaced Moede as consultation general secretary
three months ago, said, ``We believe we are being led by God in a
new way that has implications far beyond these nine churches _ the
unity of the holy catholic church.''
