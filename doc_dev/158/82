EMPEROR OF THE AIR Stories by Ethan Canin (Harper &amp; Row: $7.95) 
</P>
<P>
This collection of short stories, Ethan Canin's first, laudably runs counter to 
the current trend of minimalist prose by writers in the younger-than-30 set. 
His symbols, laden with relevance, are woven into the text, at times 
overburdening the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
In the title story, a 69-year-old retired astronomy teacher refuses to cut down 
his 250-year-old elm tree, although it is infested with insects. When the 
narrator receives a note from his neighbor, Mr. Pike, that the city will do the 
cutting, he seeks revenge: He collects a bottle full of the offending pests, 
and crawls into his neighbor's yard to share the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
But, before he opens the jar, Mr. Pike and his son come into the yard. The 
father, assuming a tone of knowledge, is pointing out the constellations but 
inventing their names: the Mermaid's Tail, Mount Olympus, the Emperor of the 
Air. Somehow this scene stirs a change in the astronomer-narrator. 
</P>

Canin's "epiphanies are first-rate," Richard Eder wrote in these pages. "They 
are also everywhere. They do not transform the stories; they virtually are the 
stories."
