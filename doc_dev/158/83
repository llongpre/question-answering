ONE MILLION MERCENARIES: SWISS SOLDIERS IN THE ARMIES OF THE WORLD by John
McCormack Leo Cooper Pounds 18.50, 224 pages
Despite its somewhat fatuous title - the actual number of Swiss who served
in foreign armies cannot be so easily calculated - this is an excellent and
absorbing study, albeit a brief one. Every precaution however should be
taken to prevent any copies falling into the hands of our present cabinet.
It contains too many hints on how to profitably privatise the military.
Given that Switzerland is now synonymous with watches, fine chocolate, the
Red Cross and the Geneva Convention, it comes as a mild shock to learn just
how warlike the Swiss of yore could be. Yet warlike they were. In the
closing decades of the 15th century and opening decades of the 16th, Swiss
infantry was invincible. Not only did it secure the independence of the
original cantons, but it wrecked Charles the Bold's attempt to transform
Burgundy into a European power; and it also played a not infrequently
decisive role in the Italian Wars of Charles VIII and Francis I.
Swiss prowess was based on the pike. A hardy mountain people unused to
horses, they had somehow to cope with cavalry attacks across the Alpine
lowlands. The pike square, sometimes caricatured as a hedgehog, provided the
solution. Used defensively it could withstand the charge of any cavalry;
used offensively, it could mow down opposing infantry.
In time the development of firearms and cannon undermined the pike. But by
then the Swiss had earned themselves an unassailable reputation, and for
more than three centuries most major European armies - but especially the
French - had their Helvetian contingents. And they made good soldiers. As
John McCormack records, so long as they were paid they could be relied upon
to perform well, sometimes brilliantly, in battle.
In many major European engagements, their contribution won the day. In
short, as mercenaries, the Swiss were the exception that proved the rule.
This had largely to do with an esprit de corps that, once established,
refused to die; and with a lack of opportunity to follow the noble
profession of arms within Switzerland's own borders. But as the mercenary
tradition evolved, so did the business. An estimated 0.2 per cent of the
Swiss population were employed as mercenaries at any given time in the 17th
and 18th centuries, their repatriated earnings and pensions accounting for 6
per cent or more of the gross national product.
The mercenary companies however were literally owned by their commanders,
who hired them out according to the terms of 'Capitulations' negotiated
between the Swiss Diet and foreign states. Over the years, 'Military
Enterpriser' families gained a stranglehold over Swiss politics and the
national economy.
Where McCormack fails in his otherwise impeccable inquiry is with regard to
the latterday exploitation of capital accumulated by these Enterprisers.
Hoffman-Laroche is anecdotally cited as a beneficiary, but it would be
interesting to discover exactly how many other Swiss corporations owe their
existence to hard currencies earned the hard way. The demise of Swiss
mercenary forces coincided with the growth of nationally conscripted armies,
following the French Revolution.
The interesting question, however, is whether the Swiss regiments would have
petered out in any case. The evidence McCormack assembles strongly suggests
that during the course of the 18th century the double burden of military
leadership and business management was too much for the captains. As profit
margins diminished, so they had to make savings where they could. Pay,
provisions, morale and discipline - in a word, effectiveness - suffered
accordingly.
