   Meridian Bancorp expects 1986 earnings to match analysts' projections of $2.35 to $2.45 a share, Samuel A. McCullough, president and chief executive officer, said. 

   That range would indicate net income of $59.5 million to $62 million, compared with 1985 earnings of $58 million, or a restated $2.09 a share, reflecting a 2-for-1 stock split distributed in August 1985. 

   Meridian was formed last spring by the consolidation of American Bank &amp; Trust Co. here, Central Penn National Bank in Philadelphia and First National Bank of Allentown, Pa. 

   Last week, Meridian completed the acquisition of First National Bank of Pike County, Pa. 
Later today the bank holding company plans to announce the start-up of a venture-capital limited partnership. 

   Meridian Venture Partners, initially capitalized at about $18.3 million, will invest in businesses that are beyond the start-up phase but still in the early stages of development, Mr. McCullough said in an interview. 

   The acquisition of the Pike County bank gave Meridian a foothold in northeastern Pennsylvania along the borders of New Jersey and New York. 

   Eventually, Mr. McCullough said, Meridian plans to enter New Jersey and Delaware. 
However, he said Meridian probably won't make any acquisitions soon. 

   "Prices to buy banks are too high," said Mr. McCullough. 
"In the meantime, if some non-banking company looks good, we'll buy it."
