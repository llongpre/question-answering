for 45.2% stake

WATTS BLAKE Bearne's fight to remain independent received a boost yesterday
when three of its big shareholders said they had failed to find a buyer for
their combined stake of 45.2 per cent.
The companies will continue to act as a concert party. Under takeover rules
the sale to a single party would have led to an offer for the entire issued
share capital of the ball clay producer.
The three investors, which had hoped to sell their shares by May 18, are
Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family, Sibelco, a
privately-owned Belgian-based producer of silica sand for the glass
industry, and Quarzwerke, a private German producer of silica sand.
Mr John Pike, Watts Blake Bearne managing director, said: 'I am very pleased
that their offer for sale terminated. However, the concert party remains in
force. The sooner this thing is sorted out the better.'
The three shareholders are expected to try and sell their shares again,
although they have not yet formally made a decision. J Henry Schroder Wagg,
the merchant bank, is advising them.
Mr Pike is concerned that it could be difficult to mount a defence if the
sale of a large block of shares triggered a bid at an unsatisfactory price.
Watts Blake Bearne's shares fell 10p to 410p.
