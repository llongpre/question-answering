   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space Sunday, carrying a classified payload an expert
said was probably a pair of military communications satellites.
   The powerful 16-story-tall booster blasted off under heavy cloud
cover from Space Launch Complex 4 about 10:03 a.m, said Capt. John
Sullivan, a spokesman at Vandenberg, about 140 miles northwest of
Los Angeles.
   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn't
announce the launch in advance and did not identify the payload to
be put into orbit.
   The Titan 34D probably carried two Satellite Data System
satellites, said John Pike, a space policy expert for the
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. He said it also
could have carried either a KH-9 or KH-11 photoreconnaissance spy
satellite.
   Pike, who knew of the launch in advance, said Friday the SDS
satellites are used for military communications, especially in the
event the United States had to launch a nuclear attack.
   The Titan 34D is America's most powerful space booster, although
it soon will be replaced by the Titan 4, which is due for its maiden
launch next year from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   Sunday's rocket was the last Titan 34D that will be launched from
Vandenberg. Two more are scheduled for launch from Cape Canaveral
early next year.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Florida on Sept. 2, but
sources told The Associated Press it failed to orbit its payload
because the rocket's third stage failed to reignite.
   Titan 34Ds were grounded for 18 months following two successive
explosions during launches from Vandenberg in 1985 and 1986.
