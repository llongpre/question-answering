   NASA engineers, baffled by
Columbia's persistent fuel leaks, pored over data Tuesday from the
shuttle's fourth failed launch attempt and pushed ahead for next
month's flight of Discovery.
   Columbia's commander Vance Brand said before leaving for Johnson
Space Center in Houston that he and his six-man crew were
disappointed the shuttle did not lift off early Tuesday as planned.
The next launch attempt for the astronomy mission will be no
earlier than November.
   ``Most of us have been involved in the space flight business for
some time, and we know from experience that hardware problems can
be difficult and it does not pay to fly until the spacecraft is
ready,'' Brand said.
   ``The astronomy mission is very worthwhile, and the crew is
ready and anxious to fly as soon as the remaining hydrogen leaks
are repaired.''
   NASA's fourth attempt to launch Columbia with a $150 million
astronomical observatory ended abruptly Monday evening, about seven
hours before planned liftoff. Despite repairs, hydrogen flooded the
engine compartment as the shuttle was being fueled.
   It was the third time since May that Columbia's countdown was
halted because of leaking hydrogen.
   ``We're really at a loss on this particular problem,'' said
David Winterhalter, director of systems engineering and analysis
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``Engineers are a resourceful group. We're digging in, thinking
more about it, what is it we can do we haven't done.''
   NASA was forming an investigative team Tuesday to look into the
matter.
   Henry Pohl, director of engineering at Johnson Space Center,
said hydrogen appears to be escaping from a pin-size hole or
several tinier cracks inside Columbia's crowded engine compartment.
He said the leaks are difficult to trace because they appear only
when the liquid hydrogen is at its coldest - minus 423 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   Officials believe the leaks are linked to the dismantling of
Columbia after its last flight in January. Workers took apart the
engine compartment in a search for contamination by a
metal-polishing abrasive.
   ``I think we created a problem in that process,'' Pohl said.
``Someplace we didn't get a seal back on right or something.''
   Insulation probably will have to be removed in the engine
compartment, a time-consuming job, Pohl said. Workers are not
expected to gain access to the area until Wednesday.
   Pohl said he's not worried Discovery might have hydrogen leaks
similar to those plaguing Columbia and Atlantis.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off around Oct. 8 with a
plutonium-powered satellite that will explore the sun's poles.
   If Discovery does not lift off with the Ulysses satellite by
Oct. 23, the $750 million mission will have to wait until late 1991
when Earth, the sun and Jupiter are back in the proper alignment.
   NASA has not decided whether to conduct a tanking test on
Discovery before launch because it takes about five days.
   Discovery experienced no problems during its flight in April
with the Hubble Space Telescope, which later was found to have a
flawed mirror. That was the last time a shuttle has flown.
   John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists'
space policy project, said the fact NASA has launched shuttles 35
times proves ``they can make it work in general.''
   ``The problem is making it work in particular right now,'' Pike
said. ``The bottom line is it's more bad news when they really
could use some good news.''
