   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When it comes to stamps, millions of citizens
seem to have ideas about what should go on them. Pressure and
controversy can get pretty intense (as in behalf of the Elvis
Presley stamp). That's why the committee that decides meets behind
closed doors and never explains its reasoning for picking one
subject over another.

   They are America's headstones, its family
albums.
   Stamps.
   It used to be the U.S. Postal Service would put George Washington
(282 times) or Ben Franklin (133) on its postage and hope they would
stick.
   But in the 2,500-plus stamps since the first Washington-Franklins
of 1847, postage has become more than just glued paper. Today's
stamps are colorful as rainbows, varied as flea markets and one of
the most exclusive portrait galleries in the world.
   Every year some 25-30,000 native sons, bypassed heroes, worthy
causes, deserving luminaries, memorable landscapes and happy
birthdays are proposed for a stamp. Only 25 or 30 make it.
   Once upon a time Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a collector, would
call up Postmaster General Jim Farley with an idea and tell him to
get printing. Today, in the course of human events, a committee
decides.
   Who, how, what, when, where?
   ``It's about as democratic a process as we have going,'' says
Dickey Rustin, manager for stamp information at the Postal Service.
   The deciders, appointed by the postal commissioners for the last
30 years, are the 13 members of the Citizens Stamp Advisory
Committee. They meet here six times a year to decide, by majority
vote, whom you will be sticking your tongue out at on the way to the
post office.
   The decisions tend to be upbeat. Wyatt Earp stands a better
chance of being postally canonized than Billy the Kid. (Jesse James
was proposed and turned down. So was a pretzel with beer-flavored
glue). It helps to be good looking. We've had cardinals and bald
eagles and poinsettias. No turkey buzzards.
   Beyond the certitude that there will always be a stamp in
circulation showing the American flag (54 times) it is difficult to
make book on who will make the postal hall of fame.
   Consider:
   We have had Abraham Lincoln but not Jefferson Davis; Babe Ruth
but not Roger Maris; Lewis and Clark but not Zebulon Pike; Crazy
Horse but not George Armstrong Custer; Canada but not Japanese
cherry trees; paddy wagons but not Bonnie and Clyde; Mary Cassatt
but not Jackson Pollack; John Harvard but not Elihu Yale; Jack
London but not Irving Berlin; jack in the pulpit but not skunk
cabbage; a Frank Lloyd Wright house but not an outhouse (proposed
and flushed); Nobelists Sinclair Lewis, William Faulkner and John
Steinbeck but not Nobelist Ernest Hemingway; Duke Ellington but not
King Louis Armstrong; Hoover, Herbert but not Hoover, J. Edgar;
Feeding the Hungry but not fat farms.
   Conversely, or perversely, we have had population control and
baby carriages, Mexican independence and the Battle of San Jacinto.
   One might surmise that Custer and Jeff Davis are in limbo because
they lost, Hemingway because he took his own life, Maris because of
his asterisk. You'll never know because the committee doesn't
publicly explain its reasoning.
   When John Harvard was stamped in 1986 to celebrate his namesake
university's 350th birthday, that opened the door for Yalies and
loyal sons and daughters of Leland Stanford, Sophia Smith, Johns
Hopkins, Lord Jeffrey Amherst and Col. Ephraim Williams, et al., to
demand equal billing. To cool hot potatoes, the post office will not
henceforth immortalize college founders.
   Better news for others. Satchmo may make it because the post
office issues a stamp every year honoring the nation's black
heritage. The outhouse probably won't because, as Rustin says,
stamps are ``the nation's calling cards.'' Irving Berlin probably
will get there, but he's not dead yet. You have to be entombed for
at least 10 years to qualify unless you're a president. They're
eligible one year after their first posthumous birthday.
   ``We believe someone has to stand the test of time,'' Rustin
explains.
   Love has apparently met that standard. The annual ``love'' stamp
sells _S.W.A.K. _ a smashing one billion per issue.
   The advisory committee is, as are the stamps they select, a cross
section. Three are historians. One publishes a graphic arts
magazine. An executive of General Motors is a stamp collector.
Digger Phelps, a collector and Notre Dame basketball coach, is a
member. So is Belmont Fairies, former editor of the canceled
Washington Star, TV executive Jack Rosenthal and Dr. Douglas Lewis,
director of sculpture at the National Art Gallery.
   When the committee meets, Rustin and his staff present the
proposals that have flooded in over the transom from a stamp-minded
citizenry. Each has had a modicum of research. Some proposals are
obvious. Columbus stumbled upon the New World 500 years ago in 1992.
World War II for U.S. involvement will be 50 years old starting in
1991. D-day seems a likely choice. Japanese bombers over Pearl
Harbor don't.
   ``We get into some things controversial,'' says Rustin, ``but we
don't want to reflect badly on the U.S. We don't build a fire that's
not going to warm us.''
   There was a 1981 stamp, for instance, that said ``Alcoholism@You
Can Beat It.'' Would the recipient think there was a hidden message
beyond the one in the envelope?
   The committee's closed door discussions can get heated over
social concerns or a nominee's worthiness. Some proposals have
waited 40 years in the bullpen before making it to stampdom. If the
committee remains undecided, it may ask Rustin for further research.
   Some proposals are accompanied by petitions. ``We neither
encourage nor discourage them,'' says Rustin. The commission allows
no lobbying before it and doesn't credit any proposal.
   ``We don't want to get into who was first.''
