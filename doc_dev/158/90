   A man who served three years in prison for
killing one sister's boyfriend has been booked on a murder charge
for fatally shooting another sister's boyfriend, authorities said
Thursday.
   Alvin Hilliard, 31, said he shot Abe Anderson early Wednesday
``because he was going to fight everyone in the house.'' He said he
had similar fears for his family's safety on Thanksgiving Day 1982
when he killed a man with an ax.
   Hilliard was held on a murder charge Thursday at the Pike County
Jail. Bond was set at $15,000.
   Anderson, 25, was dead on arrival at the hospital, killed with
one 12-gauge shotgun blast to the left back, Pike County Sheriff
Harold Anderson.
   The sheriff, who is no relation to Anderson, said the dead man
got into an argument with Johnny and Alvin Hilliard.
   ``Johnny Hilliard sustained several knife wounds to his arm and
leg. Shots were fired from a .22 caliber rifle and a 12-gauge
shotgun,'' the sheriff said.
   Hilliard said his 24-year-old sister Dorothy and Anderson had
dated on and off for two years. The shooting occurred, he said,
after Anderson beat his sister, tried ``to take over the house''
and cut another family member so badly that he required more than
100 stitches.
   ``I got a gun and shot him. I wanted to stop him,'' Hilliard
told The Montgomery Advertiser in an interview published Thursday.
   Hilliard was paroled on June 2, 1986, after serving one-third of
his manslaughter sentence for killing Henry Bean. Hilliard said he
hit Bean with an ax because Bean was beating his 35-year-old
sister, Mary.
   A parole violation warrant against Hilliard is expected to be
issued soon because he was on parole from the 10-year manslaughter
sentence.
