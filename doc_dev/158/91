<HEAD>Police Source Says Folks Join Devilish Cult For Sex</HEAD>

   Members of a Satanic cult have been
frightened by the paranoia aroused by rumors that the cult was
planning a human sacrifice, authorities say.
   ``They're keeping kind of low,'' Magnolia Police Chief Smithie
Buie said of the cult members Friday.
   Terrified parents kept hundreds of students out of schools in
the nearby southern Mississippi town of McComb Thursday as a
precaution against a rumored list of potential student victims.
   But an unidentified source within the group informed police that
``they didn't want to hurt or frighten anyone,'' Buie said.
   Police in Pike County reported a quiet evening Thursday, the
night, according to rumors, that Satanists were to march down a
McComb street before sacrificing a young virgin.
   ``We didn't receive a single report Thursday night,'' Pike
County Sheriff Robert Lawson said Friday.
   Buie said the cult has existed since at least the 1960s and
although its members occasionally sacrifice animals, including cats
and dogs, they haven't been known to harm people.
   The midnight meetings are attended by between five and 20
couples, mostly between 17 and 23 years old, and are followed by
group sex, Buie said the source reported. New members traditionally
are recruited by word of mouth and are required to sacrifice an
animal, he said.
   ``I think they're mainly in it for the orgies,'' Buie said.
   Participants may be guilty of cruelty to animals and
trespassing, Buie said, but they change their ritual sites and
police never know where they will meet.
   ``Actually, as long as they are peaceful, we'd probably never
know what was happening,'' the police chief said. ``Also there's a
question of a man having a right to his own worship.''
