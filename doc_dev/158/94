   After a year on the loose, a rooster that
evaded traps and tranquilizer darts was finally captured by three
pursuers working under the cover of darkness and armed with a
flashlight and a fishing net.
   Henry the rooster's owners moved away a year ago.
   During the past few weeks, animal control officials intensified
their efforts with traps and the tranquilizer guns because Henry's
droppings were suspected of infecting a child at The Playhouse day
care center.
   Monday night, day-care center director Geri Moton, and her
son-in-law, Kevin Pike, took matters into their own hands. Joining
them was Russell Burkett, grandfather of a child who was recently
enrolled at the center.
   ``This was their first day at The Playhouse and Mr. Burkett
said, `Honey, I'll help you get that rooster but we'll have to do
it at night,''' Moton said.
   They found Henry in a tree. Taking advantage of roosters' poor
night vision, Pike climbed up and knocked Henry to the ground.
   The pesky bird made a dash for freedom, but Moton nabbed him
with a fishing net.
   ``He's gone and this morning I sang the Hallelujah chorus,''
Moton said Tuesday.
   Burkett is keeping the rooster as a companion for his grandson,
Raymond Shollanbarger.
   ``I didn't want him shot,'' Moton said. ``I'm just glad the
rooster found him a good home.''
   She said Henry's owners moved last year and left him behind.
   Gaston health officials wanted the bird removed because stray
animals are a violation of day-care health standards.
   The health department became involved two weeks ago when a
pediatrician reported a case of campylobacter infection, a
bacterial disease that causes flu-like symptoms. Animal feces is
one source of the infection and officials said the illness might
have come from the rooster.
