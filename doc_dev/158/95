   Corbin Bernsen was looking for a new acting
experience when he accepted the lead role in the mind-bending
thriller ``Breaking Point'' on cable television.
   He plays a World War II American intelligence officer whose
capture just weeks before D-Day gives the Nazis an opportunity to
pry out the invasion secrets in a most diabolical and deceptive
manner.
   ``Breaking Point'' gets its first showing on Turner Network
Television on Friday and will be repeated Saturday and Sunday. It's
a remake of the 1964 film starring James Garner.
   ``I did it like an Alfred Hitchcock movie or something from the
`Twilight Zone,''' says Bernsen, who stars regularly as lawyer
Arnie Becker on NBC's ``L.A. Law.''
   ``That's what drew me to it. I've always wanted to do something
in that genre. Since it's for cable we took risks. The wonderful
thing is that after it's approved they leave the artists alone to
do their work. It's not as pat as regular television. The
experience was that of doing a feature film. I wanted to experience
what my character feels, the pain, the torture, the freedom, and to
be able to have the audience feel it, too.''
   He plays Maj. Jefferson Pike, who is abducted by the Germans,
tortured briefly and wakes to find the war is over and he's in an
American hospital. Or so he's led to believe. It's a plot to learn
the secrets of D-Day. John Glover is the ``American'' doctor and
Joanna Pacula is the nurse he falls in love with after being told
his wife has died.
   ``We filmed the exteriors at Lake Tahoe. There's a wonderful old
school and a retreat that looks like an Alpine chalet. When I first
read the script I said, `Great, England and Germany. I can take my
son to meet his grandparents,''' said Bernsen, whose wife is
English actress Amanda Pays.
   ``Well, we filmed England in Pasadena and Germany at Lake Tahoe.
Peter Markle directed, and it has some interesting camera work.
John Glover and I had a great relationship and I think our scenes
are well written and work well. Pike's led to believe the war's
over and he talks about the coming invasion of Normandy. Then he
finds out he's been deceived and he hatches his own deception.''
   Bernsen did get to Europe, however. He and his wife spent a
month traveling with their four-month-old son Oliver.
   ``Breaking Point'' is Bernsen's first movie for cable. His
feature film work in a busy schedule in the past few years included
``Major League,'' ``Disorganized Crime,'' ``Bert Rigby, You're a
Fool'' and ``Hello, Again.''
   Bernsen said he would talk soon to the producers of ``L.A. Law''
to see what would happen to Arnie Becker next season.
   ``I know what needs to be done,'' he said. ``He needs some
re-evaluation. Arnie hasn't quite figured it out. All life has to
reproduce but Arnie's caught in a cycle of refusing to commit
himself. He hasn't grown up enough to accept the moral conventions.
The thing that I put into Arnie is that he senses something is
missing. I don't think I could play a character who doesn't
recognize it.
   ``I think Arnie is terrified of marriage. As a divorce lawyer he
knows all the built-in problems. I think he also sees it as a
progression toward death. He's trying to hold onto his youth.''
   He said one of the advantages of doing ``Breaking Point'' is
that Pike is so different from Arnie.
   ``It's good to do a character who has his values and his
loyalties straight,'' he said. ``After `L.A. Law,' I'd like to do
more features. I'll have had seven years of a family and a house
and a base. I think it'd be fun to live and work other places in
the world. I'd like to base myself in Europe for a while. I could
travel and spend time with my wife and son.''
   Bernsen grew up in Los Angeles. His father, Harry Bernsen is a
former agent and now a producer. His mother, actress Jeanne Cooper,
has been on the CBS soap opera ``The Young and the Restless'' for
the past 15 years.
   He said he occasionally works with his father in developing
projects. ``I'm working on an idea for a stage musical and I have
an idea for a series for Amanda and myself.''
