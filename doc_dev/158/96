   Irish Republican Army member Joe Doherty isn't
leaving prison, but he's getting a new address _ one his supporters
hope will refocus attention on his case as he starts his eighth year
in a federal jail.
   The City Council this week is prepared to rename the street
corner below his cell Joe Doherty Corner. The plan to honor Doherty,
the convicted killer of a British army sergeant in 1980, has angered
British officials who condemn him as a terrorist and a murderer.
   Supporters of the name change, which is to remain in effect until
Doherty is released, hope it will help free him.
   ``It is an abomination that Doherty should be held in a prison in
our city as long as he has been,'' said Carolyn Maloney, the city
councilwoman who proposed the change.
   A City Council committee and a local community board already have
approved the proposal. The full council is expected to pass the
measure at its Tuesday session.
   Supporters hope to hold the official ceremony renaming the corner
on June 18 _ the beginning of Doherty's eighth year at the jail.
   ``He's lived here as long, maybe longer, than most of the people
in this neighborhood,'' said Paul Goldstein, district manager of the
community board that approved the name change.
   Indeed, he has been in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
longer than any other inmate in its history, longer than most of its
guards. His seventh-floor cell and an orange prison jumpsuit are the
fixtures in his life.
   Doherty was unaware of the move to rename the intersection until
last week, when his lawyer, Mary Pike, told him about it.
   ``He was visibly delighted. ... He's touched and delighted that
the people of the city have seen fit to address the injustice of his
situation,'' Pike said.
   The 35-year-old prisoner has been the focus of a legal battle
since his arrest at a Manhattan bar in 1983.
   Three years earlier, Doherty was convicted of murder in the
machine-gun slaying of a British army captain during an IRA ambush
in Northern Ireland. Doherty escaped from a Belfast prison before
his conviction, used a false passport to enter the United States and
avoided capture for two years.
   The British want him returned to finish his prison term. The
Reagan and Bush administrations have supported their request but
deportation has been blocked in the courts.
   Supporters say Doherty is a freedom fighter entitled to political
asylum. And the list of those supporters is impressive: Mayor David
Dinkins, Cardinal John J. O'Connor and more than 100 members of
Congress have called for his release.
   The almost exclusively Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to push the
British out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, join it with
the Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.
   Doherty has never been charged with a crime in the United States;
he's been held without bail that entire time. His lawyers were back
in court on Friday arguing for his release pending resolution of his
status.
   Courts have ruled that he was entitled to a hearing on whether he
should be given political asylum, but U.S. Attorneys General Edwin
Meese and Dick Thornburgh have refused to grant him such a hearing.
The whole matter is still being weighed in federal court in
Manhattan.
   North of the prison in midtown Manhattan is the British
Consulate, where reaction to the honor for Doherty was a mixture of
surprise and disgust.
   ``He's a murderer. ... The vast majority of the people in
Northern Ireland will feel somewhat bewildered and puzzled by the
decision to name a street after him,'' said Brian Kirk, information
director.
   It's not the first time city officials used a street sign to send
a political message.
   Last year, the corner of 42nd Street and 12th Avenue _ the site
of the Chinese Consulate _ was renamed Tiananmen Square. A section
of First Avenue opposite the United Nations was christened Raoul
Wallenberg Walk in 1985 after the Swedish diplomat who died or
disappeared in Soviet custody after World War II.
   The victory by Doherty supporters does not mean he will be able
to see a street sign through the jail's tiny windows.
   ``The irony is though the sign will be literally right outside,
Joe will not see it,'' said Pike.
