   Outside of East Berlin, the
country's showcase capital, East Germans live in dreary and decaying
cities where nagging shortages and chronic pollution aggravate a
rigidly regulated life.
   ``Everywhere you look outside the city centers, where most
foreigners go, the country is disintegrating. It's crumbling before
your eyes,'' said Helmut Lange, a Leipzig student who recently
joined an exodus to the West.
   Although East Germany's standard of living is the envy of its
Eastern European neighbors, thousands are embarrassing the Communist
leadership by fleeing shortly before next month's 40th anniversary
celebrations.
   Many of them come from the provincial cities where life is the
toughest, and the harsh crackdown on diseen 100 years this month
since a jury sentenced eight Hatfield clan members to life in prison
and ordered a ninth hanged for the slaying of five McCoys, ending
the bloodshed in which 10 to 20 people died.
   But most participants died of old age. The Hatfields' patriarch,
William Anderson ``Devil Anse'' Hatfield, got religion and gained
community respect before he died in 1921 at the age of 83. His grave
at Sarah Ann in Logan County is marked by a towering Italian marble
sculpture of him. The leader of the McCoys, Randolph ``Old Ran'l''
McCoy, embittered by the deaths of five of his 16 children, moved to
town in Pikeville, Ky., dying in 1910 at age 85.
   Buried with them are the real reasons behind the feud in the
heart of Appalachia.
   What is known is that the Hatfields, living mainly in what is now
Mingo County, W.Va., and the McCoys, in Pike County, Ky., fought on
and off for a dozen years in the region's wooded tangle of valleys
and ridges.
   Some say the feud started in 1878 over a pig that belonged to the
McCoys and ended up in a Hatfield pen. Others say the dispute
stemmed from the Civil War, in which, this version goes, the
Hatfields fought for the Confederacy and the McCoys the Union.
Others say both families fought for the South.
   Romantics say the feud stemmed from an illicit affair between
Johnse Hatfield and Roseanna McCoy, and that she eventually bore him
a child out of wedlock.
   In a 1988 book ``Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in
Appalachia, 1860-1900,'' author Altina Waller contends the feud was
the result of a clash between the traditional culture based on
subsistence farming, represented by the McCoys, and the emergence of
capitalism fueled by coal mining, timber cutting and railroad
interests in the Hatfields' region.
   Whatever the cause, open warfare between the families began in
1882 when Devil Anse's brother, Ellison Hatfield, was stabbed two
dozen times and shot during an election day brawl in Pike County.
The Hatfields seized the three McCoys responsible, and when Ellison
died they were tied to paw paw trees and executed.
   The feud escalated until New Year's Day 1888, when the Hatfields
attacked the McCoy home in Pike County, burning it to the ground and
killing two of Old Ran'l's children.
   The governors of Kentucky and West Virginia became involved in a
jurisdictional dispute over the fighting that wound up before the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Now, McAllister's organization is trying to find a way to
commemorate the feud and the 1920 Matewan Massacre, a downtown
gunbattle between United Mine Workers sympathizers and coal company
guards in which at least nine people died. The incident was depicted
in the 1987 movie ``Matewan.''
   Robert McCoy, a former Matewan mayor, is among those who had to
grow up with the stigma attached to the feud, even though his branch
of the family had economic ties to Devil Anse and never took part in
the bloodshed.
   ``Not every McCoy or every Hatfield participated in the
shootouts,'' McCoy said. ``We're directly related to the so-called
feudists, but we weren't participants in the violent part of it.''
   But McCoy also is on the Matewan Development Center's board of
directors, whose plans call for historic restoration downtown.
   ``As a member of the family, I probably get a little tired of it.
Through the years, ever since I was in high school, it has been
brought to my attention,'' he said.
   ``But as a community, I think it's one of our great hopes for
economic survival here.''
