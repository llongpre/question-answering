   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Sea lampreys, eel-like creatures that attack
salmon and trout, are threatening the fishing industry at Lake
Champlain, the nation's sixth-largest freshwater lake. The lampreys,
which number in the tens of thousands, are finding new targets:
bass, pike, and in some cases, swimmers.</NOTE>

   Nancy Papineau still shudders at the
memory of the slimy tangle of suction-cup-filled mouths and
tooth-laden tongues in the fish tank at Dave Richard's Bait Shop.
``Absolutely gross. Horrible,'' she says.
   Richard agrees: Sea lampreys aren't a pretty sight. Nonetheless,
he's displayed them off and on for four years. With lampreys
threatening the local sport-fishing industry, Richard wants folks to
know what they look like.
   ``It's real serious,'' says Richard, who also fishes
commercially. ``I'd say if they don't control them the lake will be
dead within the next 10 years. They're getting on everything.''
   No one knows for certain how the lampreys, which are indigenous
to the ocean and have no natural predator, entered Lake Champlain.
One theory suggests that they hitched rides on boats. Regardless of
how they arrived, they've been there for over a century _ and
lately, people who rely on the lake for their livelihoods don't like
what they're seeing.
   Goose Gagnon is one of them. He quit his job in a furniture
factory last year to devote all his time to commercial fishing.
``There will be days when you come out and every fish you land has a
(lamprey) hit on them, more than one,'' says Gagnon, who's been
fishing the lake for over 30 years. ``Some I've cut open and I
refuse to eat because the meat looked bad.''
   Gagnon's not alone.
   ``I've seen fish jump that had five or six (lampreys) on 'em, and
usually they're about 8 inches long,'' says Ken Coleman, who moved
to Willsboro from Michigan three years ago. ``And they will stay
with that fish as long as possible. In most cases that one hit
doesn't kill the fish. This is why you'll see fish with scars. And
if they lose that fish they'll take another one, so they may go
through three or four fish until they reach their full size.''
   ``It's pretty severe,'' acknowledges Paul Neff, an aquatic
biologist with the New York State Bureau of Fisheries. ``Sea lamprey
activity is intense, there's a big population, in the many tens of
thousands. We should be seeing fish 8 to 15 pounds, and we just
aren't seeing them. Lake Champlain historically had a tremendous
population of Atlantic salmon, and that population went right down
the tubes. It also had a good lake trout population, and that went
right down the tubes.''
   Lampreys are blamed for much of that loss. They spawn in wetlands
and streams that feed the lake, and their larvae can live there for
three or more years. Tom Jolliff, sea lamprey unit leader for the
New York Bureau of Fisheries, says one female might spawn up to
100,000 eggs at a time. And each lamprey can live up to 17 years,
killing 40 pounds of fish during its life.
   Lampreys, which can grow longer than 20 inches, normally do their
damage in the deepest extremities of their habitat. Using their
mouths and tongues, the lampreys latch onto fish, bore holes in
their sides and literally suck the life out of the fish until they
are near death.
   These days the lampreys in Lake Champlain _ the sixth-largest
freshwater lake in the nation _ are acting more like predators than
the parasites they actually are. Their favorite targets are no
longer just salmon and lake trout.
   ``They're hitting pike and bass _ scaly, warm-water fish that
they never hit before,'' says Mike Brown, an outdoors writer who
lives on the lake. ``I caught a lot of pike last year that were 32
inches long and only weighed three pounds. They were like stick
fish.''
   ``The lamprey bothers the lake trout and the salmon, but it's
nothing compared to the job it's doing on the brown trout and the
steelheads,'' says Coleman, who dealt with a similar problem in the
Great Lakes when he worked for the Michigan game department. ``You
don't see a brown trout in here more than 2 years old.''
   Fishermen, aren't the only ones feeling the effects.
