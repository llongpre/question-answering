   The Hatfields and McCoys don't fight
anymore and many of them would just as soon forget their ancestors'
feud. But some in the community are trying to find a way to
commemorate the bloodshed.
   ``There are a lot of grandsons of Devil Anse (Hatfield) and his
brothers around here,'' said Paul McAllister, director of the new
Matewan Development Center. ``Most of them are in their 60s and
they're a little bit bitter about the reputations they had to grow
up with and live with.''
   The Matewan Development Center, located in the only three-story
building in the town of 800, features a photo display on the
massacre and other incidents in the town's history. It draws a few
people a week. McAllister is hoping the National Park Service will
help turn Matewan into a tourist attraction. He envisions a museum,
for instance, within 10 years.
   It's been 100 years this month since a jury sentenced eight
Hatfield clan members to life in prison and ordered a ninth hanged
for the slaying of five McCoys, ending the bloodshed in which 10 to
20 people died.
   But most participants died of old age. The Hatfields' patriarch,
William Anderson ``Devil Anse'' Hatfield, got religion and gained
community respect before he died in 1921 at the age of 83. His grave
at Sarah Ann in Logan County is marked by a towering Italian marble
sculpture of him. The leader of the McCoys, Randolph ``Old Ran'l''
McCoy, embittered by the deaths of five of his 16 children, moved to
town in Pikeville, Ky., dying in 1910 at age 85.
   Buried with them are the real reasons behind the feud in the
heart of Appalachia.
   What is known is that the Hatfields, living mainly in what is now
Mingo County, W.Va., and the McCoys, in Pike County, Ky., fought on
and off for a dozen years in the region's wooded tangle of valleys
and ridges.
   Some say the feud started in 1878 over a pig that belonged to the
McCoys and ended up in a Hatfield pen. Others say the dispute
stemmed from the Civil War, in which, this version goes, the
Hatfields fought for the Confederacy and the McCoys the Union.
Others say both families fought for the South.
   Romantics say the feud stemmed from an illicit affair between
Johnse Hatfield and Roseanna McCoy, and that she eventually bore him
a child out of wedlock.
   In a 1988 book ``Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in
Appalachia, 1860-1900,'' author Altina Waller contends the feud was
the result of a clash between the traditional culture based on
subsistence farming, represented by the McCoys, and the emergence of
capitalism fueled by coal mining, timber cutting and railroad
interests in the Hatfields' region.
   Whatever the cause, open warfare between the families began in
1882 when Devil Anse's brother, Ellison Hatfield, was stabbed two
dozen times and shot during an election day brawl in Pike County.
The Hatfields seized the three McCoys responsible, and when Ellison
died they were tied to paw paw trees and executed.
   The feud escalated until New Year's Day 1888, when the Hatfields
attacked the McCoy home in Pike County, burning it to the ground and
killing two of Old Ran'l's children.
   The governors of Kentucky and West Virginia became involved in a
jurisdictional dispute over the fighting that wound up before the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Now, McAllister's organization is trying to find a way to
commemorate the feud and the 1920 Matewan Massacre, a downtown
gunbattle between United Mine Workers sympathizers and coal company
guards in which at least nine people died. The incident was depicted
in the 1987 movie ``Matewan.''
   Robert McCoy, a former Matewan mayor, is among those who had to
grow up with the stigma attached to the feud, even though his branch
of the family had economic ties to Devil Anse and never took part in
the bloodshed.
   ``Not every McCoy or every Hatfield participated in the
shootouts,'' McCoy said. ``We're directly related to the so-called
feudists, but we weren't participants in the violent part of it.''
   But McCoy also is on the Matewan Development Center's board of
directors, whose plans call for historic restoration downtown.
   ``As a member of the family, I probably get a little tired of it.
Through the years, ever since I was in high school, it has been
brought to my attention,'' he said.
   ``But as a community, I think it's one of our great hopes for
economic survival here.''
