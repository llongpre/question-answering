<LEADPARA>  A third of divorced fathers over the age of 50 lose all contact with at least
one of their adult children, according to new research presented Sunday at the
convention of the American Psychological Association.;   Children also blame
fathers more than mothers when marriages end, and many fathers say their
ex-wives block their efforts to have a good relationship with the children,
said the authors of two other studies presented at the convention.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Psychologist Charles Hoffman of California State University, San
Bernardino, said the findings indicate there should be an "affirmative action
program for divorced fathers," who currently lose custody of their children in
90 percent of failed marriages.;   "Sex roles won't change until (divorced)
mothers and fathers parent equally," he said.;   Only half had weekly contact;
  The study of older divorced fathers, conducted by sociologist Peter
Uhlenberg at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, found that only
half of the 261 subjects had weekly contact with their adult children,
compared to 90 percent of married men.;   But a third of the divorced men had
lost all contact with at least one of their children.;   "Adult children are
the principal source of care-giving to older people," he said. "(Older
divorced fathers) are not only lacking a spouse, they're also lacking children
who will come in and provide support." Uhlenberg cited data from his study
showing that only 20 percent of divorced men turn to their children in an
emergency, compared to 50 percent of married men.;   The study was of divorced
men over 50 who had at least one biological child over the age of 19. It did
not indicate at what age the men were divorced.;   Children side with mothers;
  In another study, psychologist Kathleen Welch of Northridge in Southern
California discovered that children usually side with their mothers after
divorces and blame their fathers for the marital rift. That blame only gets
worse as the children age, she said.;   "Divorce loosens the bonds to
fathers," said Welch.;   Together, the new research suggests that fathers
suffer more long-term problems after divorce than was previously thought.;  
Earlier divorce research focused on such topics as the economic problems
suffered by women and children after divorce.;   Wives blamed;   Hoffman's
research on 142 divorced fathers between the ages of 22 and 67 showed that
half said their ex-wives sabotage their efforts to maintain a good
relationship with their children.;   "They often say they want to be involved,
and they say their ex-wives keep them from that involvement," said Hoffman,
who cited earlier data showing that two-thirds of divorces nationwide are
initiated by women.;   Hoffman called on the courts to order joint custody of
children far more often. "Mothers and fathers are equally capable to raise
their children," he said.;   Adult children of divorce -- both men and women
-- have more psychological problems, including anxiety, isolation and fears of
commitment, than children from intact marriages. But the father's active
involvement is especially critical for boys, who suffer more psychological
problems than girls when parents split up, said Hoffman.  </TEXT>
