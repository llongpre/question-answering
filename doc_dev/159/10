   Hilary Antonia Foretich turned 7 last week in
hiding, with her father marking the birthday at a subdued Capitol
Hill ceremony and her mother nearing two years in jail for refusing
to disclose the little girl's whereabouts.
   Hilary has been missing for two years on Monday, since a
Washington judge ordered her mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, to
surrender the youngster for unsupervised visits with her father.
Morgan refused to comply and remains in jail on contempt of court
charges.
   Morgan claims that Hilary's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, sexually
abused the girl. Foretich vehemently denies the allegation and
contends that his former wife is suffering from delusions.
   While the parents' struggle continues, mental health
professionals are questioning whether Hilary can survive the ordeal
without emotional scars.
   ``For any child, a separation from both parents on an abrupt and
sudden basis is very harmful and could cause serious long-term
consequences,'' said Dr. Jerry Wiener, president of the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. ``There's no way that
she could not be significantly affected from this experience, and I
would think that any effects could not be undone.''
   Constance Ahrons, a noted California psychologist in the field of
child custody cases and author of the book ``Divorced Families,''
said Hilary's separation from her parents could leave the child
feeling isolated, even under protective custody.
   ``This is bound to have a profound effect on her,'' Ahrons said.
``If she was close to her parents, she may feel abandoned. In a case
like this, the child is the most vulnerable because of her age and
because she has no control in what happens to her.''
   Linda Holman, Hilary's court-appointed attorney, declined to be
interviewed and said she refuses all media requests for interviews
concerning this case. She said such interviews ``contribute to the
long-term negative impact on Hilary.''
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon has said
Morgan will remain in jail for contempt of court until she
surrenders Hilary.
   A three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals,
the city's highest local court, ordered that Morgan be released.
However, the entire court overturned that decision on Aug. 21 _
Hilary's seventh birthday _ and ordered a new hearing on the case
before the full court next month.
   That same day, Foretich and about a dozen family members and
friends marked his daughter's birthday with a small ceremony on the
steps of the Capitol. Legislation passed by the House and awaiting a
vote by the full Senate would limit the length of contempt jailings
in the nation's capital and, in effect, free Morgan.
   Later that same day, Foretich told The Associated Press he thinks
Hilary is suffering through an experience that could ultimately lead
to an early death.
   ``If my daughter is not brought back within the near future, it
will be too late. She will lose her ability to ever recover from
this,'' he said. ``I knew her to be a resilient child, but at some
point that resilience is going to fade. I don't want my daughter to
be an example, another statistic, of a teen-age suicide because she
feels abandoned by both parents and has been led to believe that her
father is a pervert and her mother is a crazy woman.''
   Morgan did not respond to a written request for an interview
relayed through jail officials.
   However, Mary Froning, a child psychologist who treated Hilary
for two years at her mother's request, said the only hardship that
the young girl has undergone is being apart from her mother for so
long.
   ``Her ordeal is being separated from her mother, the only person
in the world she trusts,'' Froning said. ``She is with the people
she chose to be with, so I have every reason to believe she is
safe.''
   Wiener, however, wondered whether the one-way communication that
he presumes Hilary receives isn't hurting the girl.
   ``One presumes she is told positive things about her mother and
negative things about her father,'' Weiner said. ``That is not
constructive, not at all.''
   Ahrons said she also was concerned that some problems could
result from the girl acting as a fugitive to disguise her real
identity.
   ``There are certainly possible problems with issues concerning
her own identity,'' said Ahrons. ``It could have some effect on her
life. A profound effect? Who knows?''
   Foretich has his own theory. ``At what point will Hilary cease to
even know who she is?'' he asked.
   ``I mean, how many times has her name been changed, has her hair
been colored? Does she even know who she is anymore? Her self-image
will soon be destroyed, if it hasn't already happened.''
