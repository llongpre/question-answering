   A little more than a year ago, in the
darkest days of winter, Laura Lynn Lazarovich lay in a hospital bed
fighting for life.
   Her skull was fractured, her right side paralyzed, her right arm
and collarbone snapped like twigs. Two front teeth had been gouged
out, both her hazel eyes were swollen shut, dried blood caked her
lips, and her body was mottled with bruises from forehead to ankles.
   A monitor watched over her heart. Intravenous tubes sprouted
from her pitifully broken body.
   Laura Lynn was 2{ years old.
   Prosecutors say her tormentors were her parents.
   Moreover, this was the child's third fractured skull in 28
months. Laura Lynn was a double victim, not only of especially
brutal beatings, but also of a bureaucratic bungle that returned
her home for the last, almost fatal attack.
   Even as assault charges were pending in New Jersey against her
parents, Roger and Janice Lazarovich, a Family Court judge there
had ordered her returned from the temporary custody of her maternal
grandparents to the Lazaroviches in Massachusetts.
   Now the law has caught up with the Lazaroviches, who had Laura
Lynn and two sons over three years, moved three times from three
states and were divorced in February.
   Today, both are in jail: Lazarovich, 25, is serving 15-20 years
after his conviction for mayhem and assault; his 23-year-old wife,
who had been scheduled to stand trial on the same charges May 2,
won a delay last week and will be tried in September.
   Superior Court Judge Charles Alberti, with 16 years on the
bench, said in sentencing Laura Lynn's father, ``I don't know if
I've dealt with a case, by virtue of this child's tender years,
where the child has been more brutalized.''
   The two still face extradition to New Jersey on two counts of
aggravated assault, according to Camden County prosecutor Sam
Asbell.
   The Lazaroviches drove 20 miles through heavy snow that
Saturday, Jan. 24, 1987, to bring their unconscious daughter from
their western Massachusetts trailer home to a Pittsfield hospital.
They said she had ``fallen off her potty seat,'' according to court
papers.
   But prosecutors said she had been beaten for more than a week.
Court papers said she was bitten, choked and her head slammed
repeatedly into a countertop from about Jan. 16 to Jan. 24.
   Laura Lynn's maternal grandmother, Pamela Christopher, could not
recognize the battered child when she visited her in the hospital
several days later. ``She didn't look like the little girl who had
left us,'' recalled Mrs. Christopher, who with her husband, Arthur,
had cared for the girl about a year.
   Mrs. Christopher asked if she could hold her, thinking it might
be for the last time. ``I questioned whether she would live,'' she
recalled. ``They had to prop her up to put her in my lap.''
   Laura Lynn spent eight months in the hospital and a Boston
rehabilitation center. Upon her release in September, the courts
granted the Massachusetts Department of Social Services temporary
custody of the girl and her brothers, Anthony, 2{, and Timothy, 1{.
   Laura Lynn was placed in a foster home in western Massachusetts.
Her brothers are together in another home in the same region. The
Lazaroviches have not been granted visitation rights and say they
do not know their childen's whereabouts. No allegation of abuse of
the boys was ever raised.
   ``Laura Lynn is doing remarkably well,'' said Joseph Landolfi, a
spokesman for the social service department. ``The boys are in very
good shape.''
   Medical experts testified that Laura Lynn suffered permanent
damage in the beating, including partial paralysis of her right arm
and loss of peripheral vision in her left eye.
   After her release from the hospital, she began showing signs of
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which is most commonly seen among
combat veterans who relive war experiences and exhibit anxiety,
irritability and rage.
   In Laura Lynn's case, she took to hitting, kicking and biting
her foster parents. In court records, a psychologist who treated
Laura Lynn last December quoted the child as saying: ``I don't like
Mummy. Mummy hurts me. Mummy pinches me and kicks me and hits the
wall with me.'' Of her father, she was quoted as saying, ``Where's
my very bad Daddy?''
   Cynthia Monahon, the psychologist, said Laura Lynn's recovery
from injury has been encouraging and she has made unexpectedly
rapid developmental gains because of her resilience and
extraordinary care by her foster parents. She said Laura Lynn is
severely traumatized and has just begun to deal with the
psychological impact of her abuse.
   ``While she has formed solid attachments in her new family and
takes enormous pleasure in her new life, Laura remains an anxious,
demanding and, at times, oppositional little girl whose functioning
ranges from 2-to-2{ years of age,'' the psychologist wrote. Laura
Lynn will be 4 on Aug. 19.
   Roger and Janice Lazarovich were each adopted at the age of 20
months, Roger by John and Marilyn Lazarovich of Norwood, Mass.,
south of Boston, and Janice by the Christophers who live near
Camden, N.J., across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Both
were bright, but few other childhood similarities exist. The
Christophers considered their daughter's marriage a mismatch.
   Both Roger and social workers describe his childhood as
tumultuous: He was given to exchanging blows and insults with his
mother, petty thefts and setting fires at home and at school.
