   When the world last looked, Bernice Albertine
King was a fidgety 5-year-old in white ribbons, piled sorrowfully
in her mother's lap at her father's 1968 funeral.
   Now, the baby daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is a
serene young woman, newly ordained as a Baptist minister and holder
of doctor of law and master of divinity degrees from Emory
University.
   Ms. King, 27, is the only one of the slain civil rights leader's
four children to follow her father's career and join the clergy.
She has a long-range goal of starting a prison ministry that also
would provide inmates with some legal counseling.
   The broader goal of continuing the sweeping social change begun
by her father is not on her agenda, Ms. King explains. But she
understands why people would take her entry into the ministry as a
sign that she intends to go in that direction.
   ``That's part of being who I am,'' she explains. ``I've learned
to live with that.
   ``My father was more concerned with sociology, the sociological
reasons for behavior,'' she says. ``I am more interested in the
psychological. I like to analyze things, to look at how things
happened to figure out why they happened.''
   Ms. King describes herself as an ambitious but private person.
She carries herself with an air so coolly serious that friends
often tell her she needs to lighten up.
   Ms. King said she might begin to do that _ after a summer of
reading the Bible, studying for bar exams and interviewing for jobs
with Atlanta-area law firms.
   She was ordained and received both her law and divinity degrees
all on the same day last month.
   Part of her serious nature, Ms. King said, stems from soul
searching in her early adulthood, when she ``spent a lot of time
running'' from the religious calling she felt at age 17.
   She thought briefly about a career as a television reporter. She
participated in some anti-apartheid protests, went to jail after
one of them. She also attended Democratic conventions, represented
her church at Baptist assemblies and spoke before the United
Nations.
   But by the time Ms. King earned a bachelor's degree in
psychology from Spelman College, she had a clearer idea of what she
wanted to do in life.
   She then enrolled at Emory and, in 1988, gave a trial sermon
that whipped into a weeping frenzy the congregation at Ebenezer,
the Baptist church presided over by both her father and grandfather.
   At her ordination, the Rev. Joseph L. Roberts, Ebenezer's pastor
and one of Ms. King's instructors at Emory, said she has ``not only
the oratorical gifts of her father but the sensitivity of her
father.''
   Ms. King said she considered taking broadcasting courses to
sharpen that powerful speaking ability.
   ``I always felt I needed to work on the way I choose words. I
still have difficulty with that,'' she said. ``And I've always
admired the way (broadcasters) speak.''
