<LEADPARA>  LAST WEEK on "Designing Women," Mary Jo -- the cute, skinny, divorced one --
decided she wants to have another child before her biological clock runs out.
Her reasons were expressed purely in terms of personal gratification: The
happiest time of her life was when her children were babies and she now
"deserves" a new baby. She doesn't think she needs a husband, or that the baby
needs a father. Unsuccessfully seeking sperm from a former boyfriend, she
assured him, "It will just take a few minutes of your time.";    It struck me
that a show that tends to be heavy on politically correct message-sending was
broadcasting a socially devastating message: Babies are to make Mom happy; Dad
is disposable.;    In real life, a woman (or, more commonly, a girl) who has a
baby to meet her own emotional needs, with no regard for the child's needs,
tends to be a pretty miserable mother. And a father's job is not completed in
bed.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Kids Count, a Washington advocacy group, recently released results of its
national survey on the status of children. I'll summarize: Bad.;    In the
'80s, child poverty rose from 16 percent to 20 percent. The rate was 43.8
percent for blacks; 38.2 percent for Hispanic children.;    Why are so many
children poor? I'll summarize: No father.;    One in three families headed by
a single woman lives in poverty; the rate for married couples with children is
5 percent.;    More than 30 percent of blacks are living in poverty; most are
children. But for blacks who graduated from high school, got a job, got
married and stayed married, the poverty rate is 6 percent.;    Divorce has
leveled off at a historically high rate, while births to unwed teen-agers rose
from 7.5 percent in 1980 to 8.2 percent in 1988.;    In the wake of the
obvious failure of "do what feels right," the ideal of the two-parent family,
until recently as unfashionable as an avocado-colored kitchen, is making a
comeback.;    Speaking on "endangered children," Chester E. Finn Jr.,
professor of education and public policy at Vanderbilt University, zeroed in
on the failure of opinion leaders (and TV script writers are much more
powerful than Op-Ed columnists) to speak the "politically ticklish" truth:
"With rare exceptions . . . two-parent families are good for children,
one-parent families are bad, zero-parent families are horrible.";    Finn
calls it "astonishing" that knowing what we know about the dangers of
inadequate parenting, "we seem to attach more opprobrium to dropping out of
school, experimenting on a cat or uttering nasty remarks on campus than we do
to giving birth to what, not so many years ago, were called 'illegitimate'
children.";    In essence, society is sending the wrong message, Finn argues,
by failing to condemn what everybody knows to be dangerous behavior: having
kids without the security and support of marriage.;    Poverty isn't the only
problem. Many children today are being raised without the emotional support of
their fathers, without the model of a man who's demonstrably committed to his
marriage and his children.;    According to researchers, children of divorce
are more likely than children from intact families to have academic and
behavior problems in school, to abuse drugs, to require psychological
counseling; they are more prone to violent behavior, suicide and unwed
pregnancy. As adults, they are more likely to get divorced.;    Of course,
that doesn't mean all children from what used to be called "broken homes" will
have problems. I don't figure my kid to be a violent, suicidal, pregnant
drop-out, and I'm divorced. On the other hand, I'm not a single parent. My
daughter has two functioning parents.;    Children of divorce aren't
inevitably doomed to lose their fathers. Children who never had a father in
the family to begin with are in much worse shape.;    Of course, nobody really
knows how to get people to get married before they become parents.;   
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson has a highly controversial proposal to reward
teen-age welfare mothers who marry with an $80 a month bonus -- and to let the
married couple earn as much as $14,500 without losing welfare aid.;    Unwed
teen-age welfare mothers would receive the same benefits they do now for the
first child, but if a girl had more babies, she wouldn't get any more money.; 
  Not many guys will marry for $80 a month, but far more significant is that
Thompson's proposal removes the marriage penalty for low-earning couples.
Currently, a young welfare mother has to consider whether her child's father
can support a family of three. If he doesn't earn much, which is likely, the
system rewards her for staying single and on welfare. But he's a lot more
likely to stick around if the relationship is official.;    Thompson's
proposal has yet to be approved by the Wisconsin Legislature, and requires a
waiver by the Department of Health and Human Services.;    I'm bothered by
denying extra benefits for additional children. Whatever the mother's
mistakes, a child needs food, clothing and shelter.;    That aside, I'd like
to see Wisconsin experiment with rewarding marriage.;    It wouldn't do much
for a girl whose boyfriend has skipped out, and it wouldn't ensure that young
couples live happily ever after, but you can't have everything.;    And I
think Mary Jo should get herself a cute, cuddly Cabbage Patch doll.  </TEXT>
