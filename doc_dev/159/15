<LEADPARA>  Robert and Cynthia Moschetta, an infertile couple, hired a surrogate mother to
bear their child. But shortly before the baby was born, the surrogate learned
that the couple's marriage was in trouble.;    The surrogate, Elvira Jordan,
reluctantly agreed to let the couple take the baby home, provided they seek
marriage counseling.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But six months later, Robert Moschetta left his wife of nine years and took
the baby, fathered with his sperm, with him.;    Now all three "parents" --
husband, wife and surrogate -- are battling for custody.;    Legal scholars
say the case, Moschetta vs. Moschetta and Jordan, could set a precedent in
California with broad implications, not just for future surrogate parent
contracts but for gay parents, stepparents and others who rear children in
non-traditional families.;    Like the nationally publicized lawsuit by
surrogate Anna M. Johnson, also of Orange County, who is appealing a court
decision not to let her keep the child she bore, the latest case raises thorny
questions about the definition of parenthood.;    Winner will face the father;
 When the trial begins March 25, Orange County Superior Court Judge Nancy
Wieben Stock will first have to decide which woman is 9-month-old Marissa
Moschetta's legal mother.;    Is it Jordan, the baby's genetic and natural
mother?;    Or is it Cynthia Moschetta? She has no biological link to the
child, but she planned for the birth, helped pay the surrogate, took a
maternity leave to care for Marissa and considers the baby her own.;    In yet
another unsettling legal twist, the woman who wins the motherhood contest will
then face off in court against Robert Moschetta, the biological father, who
wants to raise his daughter alone.;    In the so-called "Baby M" case, the New
Jersey Supreme Court gave the biological father, William Stern, and the
surrogate mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, parental rights. Stern's wife, Betsy,
who helped raise the child, was given no legal rights.;    But Cynthia
Moschetta believes women in her position should not be shut out by the
courts.;    "I don't think it's fair for someone to have to fight like this,"
she said. "I believe she's my baby.";    At the moment, Robert Moschetta has
temporary custody of Marissa, and Cynthia Moschetta has visitation two days a
week.;    Denied contact with child;  Jordan, who calls the baby Melissa
Jordan, said the Moschettas have allowed her to see the baby only once. So
far, the court has denied her any contact with the child.;    Friends say
Jordan, 42, a divorced mother of three other children, believes it is the
couple who have breached their promise to provide the baby with a loving,
two-parent home.;    "To me, the fault lies entirely with the couple and not
the surrogate," said Nina F. Kellogg, a Los Angeles psychologist who has
arranged more than 30 surrogate pregnancies, including this one.;    Attorneys
for the three say the Moschetta case is the first of its kind to come before a
court in California and perhaps in the nation. But they disagree about which
laws should apply -- contract law or family law on adoption, divorce and
custody.;    "We're on the new frontier," said Leslee J. Newman, the attorney
for Cynthia Moschetta.;    Cynthia, 51, has a 30-year-old son by a previous
marriage. Shortly before she met Robert, 35, she had her ovarian tubes tied.; 
  The couple considered adoption but settled on a surrogate mother, she said,
partly because they thought it would be faster and partly because her husband
"wanted it to be blood.";    No mention of divorce; The contract specified
that Jordan would be paid $10,000 and made no mention of what would happen to
the child in a divorce. A clause barring a couple from divorcing would be
unenforceable, said Catherine M. Adams, who drafted the contract on behalf of
the Moschettas.;    In November 1989, Jordan conceived through artificial
insemination. Five months later, Robert Moschetta told his wife he wanted to
divorce her and raise the baby himself.;    After consultations with Kellogg,
they agreed not to tell the surrogate, Cynthia Moschetta said.;    As soon as
Marissa was born May 28, 1990, Jordan announced that she would not allow the
child to go home with the Moschettas.;    "Her stand was, 'I wanted the baby
to go into a stable home with two parents who love the baby,' " Adams said.;  
 But after intense negotiations, Jordan agreed to let the Moschettas take the
baby home.;    However, according to Adams and others, Jordan imposed several
conditions: that the Moschettas agree to undergo marriage counseling for at
least one year; that Jordan would not finalize a formal adoption during that
period; and that Jordan would still be paid. Jordan also wanted to be allowed
to visit the baby to make sure all was well, Kellogg said.;    The Moschettas
agreed, Cynthia said.;    On Nov. 30, Robert told Cynthia he was moving out of
their home and taking the baby with him, saying it would be better for Marissa
to be raised by him than to be shuttled between two homes.;    In legal
documents, his attorney argued that Cynthia is "no more than a stepmother" and
should not have parental rights.;    "I bathe her; I feed her; I change her; I
give her bottles," Robert said. "Once this situation is behind me and I get
things taken care of, I think I will have a wife and family and hopefully
another baby."  </TEXT>
