   Fathers can help boys achieve higher educational
development by providing social and emotional support in childhood,
but for daughters the key age for offering support is adolescence,
a new study suggests.
   ``Shooting a basketball on the court in the evening with your
(adolescent) daughter has a positive effect ... on how far she'll
go in education,'' said researcher John Snarey.
   But sons will benefit more from such activities as taking them
trick-or-treating, supporting their joining the Boy Scouts and
spending time with them before bedtime, all while the child is
between ages 1 and 10, the study suggests.
   The work was presented Friday at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association. Snarey, a psychology professor
at Emory University in Atlanta, collaborated with Anthony Maier at
Northwestern University.
   They looked at data on childrearing practices collected from 248
working-class, white men in Boston in a study that began some 40
years ago. Then they compared that to the educational levels the
fathers' first-born children went on to achieve by age 25 or older.
About half the children were daughters.
   Similar results have been reported before from studies done
without such long-term followup, Snarey said.
   Specifically, the researchers looked at how far above the
parents' education level the children eventually rose.
   For girls, that difference was accentuated when fathers had
supported their physical development between ages 11 and 19,
through such activities as teaching them sports, giving sex
education, and taking them to the dentist.
   One possible explanation is that boys probably get help with
physical development from other people such as coaches if the
father doesn't provide it, while girls often don't have alternative
sources, Snarey said.
   Helpful activities for boys during childhood stressed
social-emotional development, such as rocking the infant to sleep
and calming the boy's fears of darkness.
   Activities to foster intellectual development did not appear to
help boys or girls, the study found.
   Researchers also looked at the eventual occupational levels of
the children, and found higher levels among females whose fathers
had provided more social-emotional development during adolescence.
That included such activities as taking them to church, spending
time with them on weekends and providing guidance on dating
problems.
   No fathering activities were found to help the boys'
occupational levels.
   The various analyses in the study took into account the
education levels of the father and mother, marital problems,
alcohol abuse, number of children, the father's IQ and his ways of
coping with stress.
   Researchers cautioned that the fathers typically began their
families during the 1950s and that other forces not addressed in
the study are no doubt acting on fathers who started families since
then.
   In addition, the sample included only white, urban,
working-class fathers, so results may not apply in other
populations, reseachers said.
