<LEADPARA>  FOR Will Dixon-Gray, being a parent means waking his 14-year-old son several
times each morning before the boy finally rousts himself from bed. It means
nagging him about wearing the rubber bands on his braces and reminding him to
walk the dogs and not to just put them in the yard. It means nursing him
through colds, reviewing his homework and watching "The Simpsons" on
television with him on Thursday nights.;    But life in the Dixon-Gray
household is not as traditional as it seems. Dixon-Gray was reminded of that
recently when some junior high school students who had been taunting his son
took to pelting the house with rocks and beer cans. They had heard Dixon-Gray
was gay and wanted to make something of it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The boy shrugged off the incident by saying he does not let such things
bother him, but his uneasiness, his yearning to hide, were obvious in other
ways, including a request that his first name not be used and his face not be
shown in a photograph.;    "I only tell certain people," the boy said,
punctuating an account of life in a gay household with long adolescent pauses.
"I didn't tell those guys, but maybe somebody else did. Mostly it's OK. It's
not like, 'Oh, I wish I had a gay father, too.' It's more like, 'Oh, so what.'
";    Dixon-Gray and his son are living at the frontier of gay life. There
have always been homosexuals who became mothers or fathers in conventional
marriages and then reared their children after divorce. But now, more and
more, gay men and lesbians are doing it the other way around -- first
declaring themselves homosexuals and then setting out to form families.;   
THE OLDEST of this new wave of children is just a few years from early
adolescence, the years when conformity is most important and when they will
probably face the harshest barbs from their peers. This is a time that the gay
and lesbian mothers and fathers are now dreading.;    "I prepare myself for
him just hating me for a period of time," said Margie Andreco, the lesbian
mother of a 2-year-old son. They live with Andreco's partner, Amy Farrell, in
Three Rivers, near Visalia in northeast Tulare County.;    In some cases, like
Dixon-Gray's, the children are adopted, which is growing easier for
homosexuals, particularly in cities with many hard-to-place youngsters. In
other cases, like Andreco's, children are born to lesbian mothers through
artificial insemination, often with a biological father who takes part in
family life much as a divorced father would. Rarer are the children born to
surrogate mothers and raised by gay fathers.;    There is no official tally of
the number of gay and lesbian parents and their children, but there are many
indicators that their numbers are growing.;    Around the country, there are
35 chapters of a gay parents' organization that was formed a dozen years ago
for divorced gay fathers and since then has expanded its mandate to include
other categories. Several cities, including Dallas and San Diego, have
counseling groups for the teen-age children of gay parents.;    In San
Francisco, a synagogue in the gay community, Temple Sha'ar Zahav, recently
organized a Hebrew school for the children of its members. In New York City, a
recreational group for the children of gay parents, Center Kids, now has 200
members.;    Although there is much debate over exactly what determines a
person's sexual preference, 35 studies conducted in the past 15 years have
shown that the children of gay and lesbian parents are no more likely to
become homosexuals and are just as well-adjusted as other children.;    In
most states, homosexuality no longer disqualifies a parent from custody,
although judges retain enormous discretion. And only two states, Florida and
New Hampshire, explicitly prohibit homosexuals from adopting.;    "If the
parents really love a child and think about the child's issues rather than
their own, there is no reason to shy away from it," said T. Berry Brazelton, a
professor of pediatrics at Harvard University, who to this generation of
parents and children is what Dr. Benjamin Spock was to the last.;    WHILE the
studies point to no particular emotional problems for these children,
psychologists and psychiatrists agree that they suffer the insults of their
peers in early adolescence and that some could benefit from therapy during
this period.;    The experts also note that parents who are intensely
political about their sexuality may make it harder for their children by
denying them the option of secrecy. But the experts say the stigma may be
offset when the children are wanted -- born or adopted after great
deliberation.;    In interviews around the nation with two dozen gay parents
and some of their children, it was clear that the diciest time for the
youngsters was the ages of 12 to 14.;    "That's the same time that kids don't
want zits or a parent who is obese," said Wayne Steinman, a founder of Center
Kids and the adoptive parent of a 3-year-old daughter.;    Until junior high
school, parents and children agree, there is virtually no stigma, although
small children will sometimes ask why one parent is missing.;    "Once in a
while she fantasizes she had a dad and he died," said Michelle Hall, a
kindergarten teacher in Downey who is raising a 5-year-old daughter with her
lesbian partner. "Then the next second, it's, 'What's for dinner?' ";   
Sometimes a child's need for secrecy collides with a parent's desire to be
open about sexuality, often a political principle in the gay community.;   
Gabrielle Lowe, a 22-year-old whose mother is a lesbian, recalled cringing
when she was picked up at school by a masculine-looking woman.;    "People
would say, 'Is that a guy?' " Lowe said. "I'd say it was my mom's friend. But
I felt a sense of 'Why do my friends have to deal with these dykey women?' "; 
  Some parents argue that total openness is the right route because it
instills pride and pluck in a child. But others disagree and keep the
political symbols of the gay world out of their children's lives as much as
possible.;    "The kids can make their own decision when they're 18 whether
they want to be seen on TV wearing pink triangles and carrying posters," said
one Michigan lesbian, a social worker and the mother of three adopted children.  </TEXT>
