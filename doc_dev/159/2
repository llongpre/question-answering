<LEADPARA>  One of the most troubling facts for social scientists and policy-makers alike
has been the high number of girls in their early teens who become mothers,
especially in America's inner cities.;    Now a novel theory proposes that
these young mothers are responding to a pattern in human evolution that
induces people growing up in extremely stressful circumstances to bear
children early and often. The theory has received considerable attention and
criticism.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Drawing on sociobiology, it holds that these teen-age mothers are
implementing a reproductive strategy that, from an evolutionary viewpoint, is
a smart bet.;    Children who grow up in dangerous conditions, the theory
holds, are primed to boost the chances of having their genes survive into the
next generation by choosing earlier sex, earlier motherhood and more
children.;    "It's not a conscious, deliberate strategy. It's a biological
response. From an evolutionary perspective, life is about dispersing your
genes into the next generation," said Dr. Jay Belsky, a psychologist at
Pennsylvania State University and the leading formulator of the new theory.;  
 Earlier puberty;  One prediction of the theory is that girls who grow up in
households where there is great emotional stress, and especially where the
father is absent, will undergo puberty at an earlier age than other girls.;   
The main factors in determining the age of menarche, which is when a girl
begins to menstruate, are genetics, health and nutrition. While these factors
can account for differences of years in the age of menarche, childhood
experiences such as fights between divorcing parents might account for just a
few months' difference, in Belsky's view.;    "It's a small effect
biologically, but quite meaningful, since the timing of menarche is so highly
biologically fixed that no one had thought there was room for psychological
influences at all," said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, a psychologist at Temple
University and a colleague of Belsky's.;    Though highly controversial, the
theory is receiving wide attention among psychologists and sociologists. Next
month it will be the lead article in the prestigious journal Child
Development.;    The theory already is under attack from other scientists. In
a commentary on the article in the same issue of Child Development, Dr.
Eleanor E. Maccoby, a psychologist at Stanford University, favors a simpler
explanation for the earlier sexual activity and pregnancies of girls from
troubled families: that they receive less parental supervision.;    Terrie
Moffitt, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin and co-author with
Belsky of one key study, believes that a hidden factor may be the mothers' age
of puberty, a factor that was not studied in his research.;    "It's a genetic
fact that girls tend to have the same age of menarche as their mothers,"
Moffitt said. "And it is also true that the earlier a girl develops sexually,
the earlier, on average, she will date and marry. And those who marry earliest
tend to have made the worst marital choices.";    In analyzing data from a
study of 501 girls in New Zealand, Moffitt found that of the 81 girls who
reached puberty at 12 or earlier, 40 had grown up in households in which the
father was absent for many years, most because of divorce.;    But of the 82
girls who did not reach puberty until age 14 or later, only 20 had fathers who
were absent.;    From turbulent homes;  Belsky also cites a study of 1,123
girls published in 1990 by Dr. Michele Surbey, a psychologist at the
University of Toronto. Surbey found that those girls who had gone through
childhood in homes where their parents were fighting and finally divorced had
menarche about four months earlier, on average, than girls from homes with
little conflict.;    However, in preliminary analysis of data from 4,800 girls
in Britain, Dr. Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University,
found no difference in the age of menarche between girls whose parents had and
had not divorced.;    To many social scientists who have studied teen-age
pregnancies, seeking the causes in evolution seems fanciful.;    The
conclusion of University of Pennsylvania sociologist Elijah Anderson,
published earlier this year, is that the more immediate cause of teen-age
sexuality and pregnancy is to be found in a lack of jobs, which leaves many
poor teen-agers with little sense that their futures hold any promise.  </TEXT>
