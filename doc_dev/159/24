<LEADPARA>  There should be an affirmative action program for divorced dads, new research
suggests.;   Fathers suffer more long-term problems after divorce than was
previously thought, said researchers at the American Psychological Society
convention in San Francisco on Sunday. A third of divorced fathers over the
age of 50 were found to lose all contact with at least one of their adult
children, and children blame fathers more than mothers when marriages end.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Other studies released Sunday send a message to working parents who rely on
long-term day care: Relax, your child will be fine.;   Children who spent
their early years in high-quality day care were well-adjusted and popular in
elementary school, one researcher said.;   One of the day care studies is
among the first to track children who started day care in infancy as they
progressed through grade school. Earlier studies were short-term only.  </TEXT>
