   Children whose parents are going through a divorce
are learning to cope through a program that includes puppets, a
board game and a mock television show that lets the kids play
divorce experts, researchers say.
   The program works for children in kindergarten through sixth
grade, using different teaching activities for different ages, said
JoAnne Pedro-Carroll.
   ``Divorce need not result in inevitable long-term trauma for
children,'' said Pedro-Carroll, director of the program at the
University of Rochester in New York.
   Studies with some 400 children of divorce show improvement in a
variety of areas, including solving day-to-day problems,
communicating with relatives, coping with family changes, getting
along with schoolmates and completing schoolwork, researchers said.
   The children said they were less anxious, less likely to blame
themselves for the divorce and less worried about family
circumstances, researchers said.
   Pedro-Carroll and colleague Linda Alpert-Gillis, both clinical
psychologists, spoke in interviews before describing the program
Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological
Association.
   The program is ``the best stuff out there'' for working directly
with children of divorce, commented Arizona State University
researcher Irwin Sandler.
   A complementary approach that involves parents who have custody
of a child is also showing success, he said.
   The Rochester program is carried out in school over 12 to 16
weeks, with four or five children to a group in kindgergarten
through third grade, and five to eight for fourth- through
sixth-graders.
   One major goal is to teach problem-solving skills. Older
children describe problems in their lives, discuss solutions and
try them out in impromptu skits in which they may play themselves,
then a parent. After trying out a solution they report back on
results.
   In this way, Pedro-Carroll said, one boy was able to persuade
his mother to let him spend Father's Day weekend with his father.
``It gave him a sense of control,'' she said.
   Children also are taught to identify and avoid focusing on
problems they cannot solve, she said.
   ``Worrying about what's happening in court between Mom and Dad,
or the support payments, those are very adult issues'' that
distract a child from schoolwork and the normal activities of being
a child, Pedro-Carroll said.
   Using a board game that involves throwing dice, moving a marker
and picking up a card that presents a problem, children discuss
what issues they can and cannot solve.
   The program also aims to teach children to identify and express
their feelings. Lacking an adult's thinking and language skills, a
child may convert unexpressed feelings into headaches or stomach
aches, Pedro-Carroll said.
   Even kindergartners can be taught to ask a parent for more time
together rather than whining or clinging, she said.
   Puppets that act out a child's feelings let younger children
more easily discuss their own experiences at home, she said.
   Older children review lessons of the program by taking turns as
divorce experts on a mock television show, in which they answer
questions posed by group leaders.
   ``You can see how that could really empower kids with a sense of
efficacy ... and competence,'' said Arizona State's Sandler.
   On an emotional level, the program is designed to help children
feel good about themselves and their families. It stresses that
``all families don't have to have two parents living together,''
said Alpert-Gillis. ``Families are people who love you, and each
family is unique and special.''
   The groups provide a place for children ``to find out they're
not alone, they're not the only ones who have the feelings they've
been struggling with,'' Pedro-Carroll said.
