<LEADPARA>  WHEN Mario Montes got a job as a teacher at a Connecticut day-care center,
some parents asked quietly that he not be allowed to change their children's
diapers.;    At the time, Montes, a father of two, was pursuing an associate
degree in early-childhood education at Greater Hartford Community College in
Hartford, Conn. He honored the parents' requests, although the implications
that he might harm the child hurt.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     After six months, the parents apologized to the Vietnam veteran and former
construction crew chief.;    "They said they were wrong and they were reacting
to what they had read in the paper," said Montes, referring to cases of male
day-care employees accused of sexually abusing children.;    Montes is now a
teacher at St. Francis Child Care Center in Hartford. He is one of two men on
staff. The other is John Fortunato, who has worked at the center for 10
years.;    And while no one complains when they change diapers, the men have
to do a lot of explaining about their jobs. A man who chooses to be around
infants is immediately suspect.;    Such is the world of the man in an
early-childhood education program. Although people say children are the
future, men are not encouraged to be a part of that. Women who choose
early-childhood education as a career do so knowing they face pitiful pay and
a lack of prestige. Men, who often are still expected to be the main
breadwinner, can hardly afford the work.;    At a time when 42 million
children, or about half of America's younger population, will live with a
single parent at some point, the Census Bureau estimates that only about 4
percent of all early-childhood education workers are men.;    George Coleman,
bureau chief of curriculum and instruction in the Connecticut Department of
Education, said the main drawback to men entering child care is poor pay.;   
"Most people who work in child care, unfortunately, do so realizing there's
another salary coming from someplace else," said Coleman, a Head Start teacher
in New York in 1973. Montes and Fortunato said their wives earn more money
than they do.;    Coleman said most men come to the field from another career
and that many men who want to work with children do so in the field of child
psychology, which is somehow a more acceptable field for men.;    Startling
absence;  But given the increasing numbers of children being raised by single
mothers, the absence of men in young children's programs is startling,
child-development specialists say.;    "When kids don't have a father in their
family or some kind of consistent contact with a male relative who really
cares about them, they are unlikely to get it any other place," said Henry B.
Viller, a psychology professor at the University of Rhode Island. "I think
it's interesting that when the mother is absent, it is likely that another
woman in the family will give that child some special attention. It's not
likely to happen, though, when a child is paternally deprived.";    The
absence of men in early-childhood learning programs reflects the unfortunate
low value society places on the care of young children, Richard Sussman,
research director for the Connecticut Commission on Children, said.;    "It's
a difficult recruiting problem," he said.;    When Sussman was looking for a
preschool for his 3-year-old son, he and his wife looked for one with men on
the staff. They found one in New Haven, Conn.;    "I think he has exposure to
a lot of different women who are extremely nurturing, and I wanted him to see
other men -- besides his father -- who are nurturing," Sussman said. "I recall
from my childhood that in sixth grade, I got my first male teacher. You got
the men in sixth grade. It was a very big deal in the wrong way.";    And what
does that teach young children, many of whom so rarely see men?;    "I can
tell you which boys in our programs haven't been around men," said William
Ortiz, director of San Juan Center in Hartford. "They go through the extremes
of being macho. I've seen kids who are 13, 14, 15 get girls pregnant, and they
stick their chests out, and I say, 'Yeah, but are you supporting them?' And
they try to justify by saying, 'I gave her that baby.';    "You can see it in
the females, too. The ones who have not been around men go through extremes of
submissiveness. Where there are shared responsibilities they understand a
little more.";    Research shows that children whose fathers are involved in
their lives at an early age are more resilient at coping with change and
stress. Viller, the psychology professor, said that children who have contact
with both sexes also are often more secure in their own gender roles.;    But
the definition of male involvement varies greatly from study to study. One
study from the Journal of Marriage and the Family said 42 percent of children
from divorced families still have a "fair amount" of contact with the absent
parent. But "fair amount" was defined as contact ranging anywhere from once a
month to two or three times a month, which is hardly comparable to time spent
with the mother.;    Equal effect;  Vicky Phares, an assistant professor of
psychology at the University of Connecticut, has studied the effects of
fathers on families when the fathers are dysfunctional -- such as alcoholics
or severely depressed. She said that the effects on children when a father is
depressed are not so different from the effects on children when the mother,
who is theoretically the primary care giver, is depressed.;    "Historically,
it wasn't until 15 years ago that fathers were even investigated in terms of
normal child development," Phares said. "The thought was, 'Fathers won't
participate in research, anyway, so why should we ask them?' "  </TEXT>
