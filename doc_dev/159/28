   The natural father of a girl who was adopted at
birth more than seven years ago asked the Supreme Court on Monday to
restore parental rights he contends were revoked unconstitutionally.
   Edward McNamara contends that San Diego authorities
unconstitutionally denied him the opportunity to raise the girl, who
was conceived during a brief romance with a woman that ended eight
months before the baby's birth.
   McNamara, now 42, did not learn that he had become a father until
after the infant's birth and the mother sought his consent to put
the child, named Katie, up for adoption.
   McNamara sought custody soon after he learned of Katie's birth,
but California limits the rights of an unwed father to block an
adoption.
   Attorney James E. Sutherland argued that California law
unconstitutionally discriminates against unwed fathers by making it
more difficult for them to assert rights as parents.
   ``Mr. McNamara's rights shouldn't be terminated except on the
same grounds as the mother's,'' Sutherland told the justices, noting
that a lower court that denied custody had concluded nevertheless
that his client was a loving father of two sons by a previous
marriage.
   McNamara, who is now seeking visitation rights, ``was denied any
opportunity to form any relationship with the child'' before she was
put up for adoption by the mother, who is not identified in court
records.
   But several justices expressed skepticism over McNamara's claim
that he was denied equal protection or denied his rights when
authorities allowed the natural mother to place Katie up for
adoption without McNamara's consent.
   ``None of our cases hold that a father in your client's position
has achieved a protected liberty,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist
told Sutherland.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor questioned why California didn't have
authority to adopt a policy ``that the state will consider the best
interests of the child over the alleged rights of the biological
father.''
   O'Connor asked Sutherland if McNamara could make the same claim
if the child's conception ``had been the result of a so-called
one-night stand.''
   ``If he had perfected all the rights manifesting significant
parental interest, he would be entitled'' to make the claim,
Sutherland replied.
   ``That would go significantly beyond the court's cases, where
there had been an established relationship'' between father and
child, O'Connor said.
   Lloyd Harmon Jr., counsel for San Diego County, defended
California's policy of giving an unwed mother the primary right to
decide whether to surrender a child for adoption.
   The legal distinction between unwed fathers and unwed mothers
furthers the ``state policy which is the speedy placement of
children by putting them in suitable settings so they can nurture,''
Harmon argued.
   Most unwed fathers are not easily identifiable and ``are not
necessarily interested in fatherhood,'' he said.
   ``Biology in and of itself does not not create a substantial
relationship or create a parental right,'' Harmon said. ``There must
be something substantial between the father and the child.''
   The decision to allow Robert and Pamela Moses to adopt Katie was
``not an intrusion into an existing family unit. Mr. McNamara and
his daughter were never a family. They never had any relationship.''
   ``The most they saw of each other may have been an hour and a
half some seven years ago,'' Harmon said.
   The justices are expected to decide the case by July.
   Outside the courtroom, Mrs. Moses, who attended the hearing with
her attorney, refused to comment on the case.
   McNamara said he feels a ``great loss'' by ``not being able to be
her father.''
   He said he has pursued the lengthy legal battle because ``it is
my right to raise my daughter and I am not going to give that right
up to anyone.''
