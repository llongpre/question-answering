<LEADPARA>  IF MAKING it through adolescence in one piece has always been a gamble, the
current crop of teen-agers is being forced to play with a marked deck.;  
Starved for stability at home and scared by doom-and-gloom predictions about
the future of the planet, today's teens are struggling hard to keep a grip,
say participants at the 99th annual convention of the American Psychological
Association, which ended Tuesday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     One major point emerges from the slew of studies presented at the meeting:
Teen-agers are paying the price for the epidemic of fractured families over
the past two decades.;   "This is the first generation growing up from the
high number of broken families," says Laureen Light, who just finished a year
as a therapist at Cal State Long Beach's student counseling center. "We're
reaping theconsequences of that.";   Here's a look at some of the reports and
research from the convention.;   FEARS: Back in the good old days, when
researchers asked teens about their fears, issues like boys, girls and getting
into college topped the list. No more. Now teen-agers are more likely to worry
about whether the world will be around long enough for them to grow up.;  
Andrew Bennett and Carolyn Klein of McGill University in Montreal asked 478
suburban high-schoolers to list their worst fears. To their surprise,
globe-threatening environmental disasters topped the list. Unemployment, AIDS,
World War III and drugs and violence followed close behind.;   "These kids
really have a lot on their plate," says Klein, who points out that the teens
in their study live in a safe, clean suburb "with parks everywhere." In a
major U.S. city, teens' fears are probably even more dire, she says.;   On the
positive side, heightened awareness of world problems may help make teen-agers
"more responsible adults.";   But at what price? Excessive fear of AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases, for example, can actually stunt normal
sexual development, says Klein. "Some children are blowing it out of
proportion," she says. "They won't even eat in a restaurant because they'd
have to touch a glass.";   And, Crowe adds, "they see all these problems and
they don't see any way out of it. They see the door shut. They don't feel they
can ever succeed.;   "Some of them start using drugs. Some of them just give
up.";   DATING AND SEX: Bombarded by MTV and other sex-obsessed media almost
from the cradle, some teens are dating and having sex almost as soon as they
hit double digits. "We were really shocked," says Amy Swarr of Loyola
University in Chicago. "When I was in junior high, nobody went out with
anybody.";   But the precocious behavior can interfere with emotional
development, Swarr and her Loyola colleague Paul Crowe found. The researchers
compared fifth- through eighth-graders who go on single dates to those who
date in groups, and found that the youthful Lotharios had worse relationships
and a poorer self-image.;   "The kids who dated in groups tended to feel more
in love," says Swarr. The group daters also felt better about their bodies and
more accepted by peers.;   One-on-one dating at a too-tender age is also tied
to the rash of broken families, most likely because those kids feel that
"here's a person who can give me love, which I don't get from my family,"
Swarr says.;   Some of the young teens in the study actually had several
boyfriends or girlfriends. But the study found they weren't all that happy
with their situation. In fact, they felt less secure than most other kids.;  
ALCOHOL AND DRUGS: The bad news here is that even the good news isn't so good.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse proudly touts the fact that drug use
among teen-agers has dropped 18 percent since the early 1980s. When you read
the fine print, though, you find out that those surveys only include kids in
school, says Maria Felix-Ortiz of UCLA's psychology department.;   In other
words, for all we know, drug use among the huge number of dropouts may be at
an all-time high. "I suspect there's a serious problem out there," says
Felix-Ortiz. "The crack epidemic is very visible on the streets.";  
Psychologist Judy Andrews of the Oregon Research Institute in Eugene says kids
from one-parent families are the most likely to abuse alcohol and drugs,
especially when the non-custodial parent loses contact with the teen.;  
"There are fewer intact families than there ever were," she says.;   To make
things worse, one-parent families tend to move more, and that mobility
translates into fewer dependable friendships for teens already hungry for
stability, she adds. Lacking the support they need as they move through
adolescence, many teens turn to drugs and drink for solace.;   MONEY:
Teen-agers, who are feeling the economic pinch along with their parents, are
joining the work force in record numbers. "There's more students working now
than ever before," says Susan Papaccio of Colorado State University. In fact,
two-thirds of all teen-agers in junior high and high school have jobs.;  
There's no problem with that -- up to a point. But Papaccio's research shows
that when teens work more than 20 hours a week, their grades start to slide
precipitously. "A lot of work is right after school," she says. "They're too
tired to do any schoolwork.";   ACADEMICS: The absence of fathers from the
home scene has less-expected consequences, too. Carol Tomlinson-Keasey,
chairwoman of the psychology department at the University of California,
Riverside, says that the alarming slide in interest in science and math among
high schoolers -- only 7 percent choose those fields as majors when they start
college -- is related to the drop in two-parent families.;   Her reasoning:
The sciences traditionally attract more males, and fathers are critical role
models for their sons. For teen-age girls, fathers who talk up the sciences
can provide a counterforce to pressures to act mostly as "social animals.";  
"When you have a stepfather, often (he) is not as involved in (setting)
expectations for the kids," says Tomlinson-Keasey. "They're usually 'Mom's
kids.' . . . We need more dads who care more about their kids.";  
INDEPENDENCE: Rebellion and freedom were the code words of many teen-agers of
the 1950s and 1960s, largely because the families they grew up in were intact.
But now, with the divorce rate soaring, teens are finding that staying close
to one's family isn't so bad after all.;   In fact, says Maureen Kenny of
Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Mass., kids with strong family ties are
better at fending off depression and other emotional problems.;   "There's
been a revision of the model that says teen-agers need to cut themselves off
from their families," says Kenny. "Now kids are saying: 'I wish there was
someone I could be close to.' ";   Feminist thinking has even helped recast
the notion of dependency in more positive terms, says Kenny. In contrast to
the old view that girls were dependent on their families while boys were
adventurers in life, some psychologists now see the value of girls staying
close to their folks.;   "Just because women stayed connected with their
families doesn't mean they're dependent," says Kenny. "Having a secure
attachment with one's family contributes to better mental health.";   MENTAL
ILLNESS: Light, the Cal State therapist, says that what she saw at the
counseling center scared her.;   "It's not just, 'I'm having problems with my
boyfriend,' " she says. "It's not just developmental issues.";   Instead, the
center routinely deals with suicide attempts, psychosis and other forms of
"severe pathology," Light says. College counseling centers are looking more
and more like community mental health clinics, she says. Her advice is that
centers had better be prepared for dealing with serious mental illness on a
regular basis.;   "I don't think that 20 years ago college counseling centers
saw the extent of pathology that we're seeing now," she says. "The kids (of
divorce) suffer more than previously we had given them credit for."  </TEXT>
