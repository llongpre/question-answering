   A 45-year-old father of six has been
convicted of molesting and sodomizing two teen-age daughters for
half of their lives and faces a sentence of life in prison.
   The conviction of Edward R. Dickey ended a weeklong trial marked
by tearful testimony from the daughters, ages 18 and 16.
   Dickey, a roofing contractor, cross-examined his daughters
himself on the first day of the trial. The 18-year-old testified
that her father had fondled and molested her since she was 9; the
16-year-old said her father began molesting her at age 8.
   Deidre Lee Dickey, 18, cried Friday when the verdict was read and
said her father's conviction was too severe. ``I think it was real
unfair,'' Miss Dickey said. ``He doesn't deserve to be in there
(jail) _ I've been there.''
   In the pre-trial phase of the case, Judge Bryant Huff had jailed
Deidre Lee and her mother, Peggy Sue Dickey, for more than a week
for refusing to testify.
   During the trial, Huff repeatedly chastised Dickey, who was
acting as his co-counsel, for what the judge called attempts to slow
the pace of the trial.
   In his closing arguments, Dickey quoted Thomas Jefferson, George
Washington and Jesus Christ and claimed courts use ``the most
extreme form of psychological warfare to coerce children to give
false testimony to convict parents of sexual abuse.''
   Assistant District Attorney Don Johstono also quoted Jesus,
telling the jury in his summation, ``It is better to have a
millstone around your neck and be thrown into the sea than to lead a
child to sin.''
   He told the jury there had, indeed, been brainwashing but that it
had been done by Dickey and his wife, not the government.
   After deliberating for morre than three hours, the jury convicted
Dickey on eight counts of child molestation, aggravated child
molestation, sodomy and aggravated sodomy.
   Huff ordered Dickey held without bond until sentencing on
Thursday.
   Dickey could be sentenced to life in prison for the aggravated
sodomy conviction and more than 150 years in prison on the others.
   Dickey's wife said her husband likely would appeal the verdict.
   Her next fight, she said, will be to regain custody of her
children from Gwinnett County officials.
   All of the Dickeys' children except Deidre Lee, the oldest, are
in custody of the county social services agency. The couple's
16-year-old daughter, a younger daughter and two young sons are in
foster care. The couple's 13-year-old daughter is staying at the
county children's shelter.
   Dickey also was charged with molesting the 13-year-old daughter,
but prosecutors agreed to drop the charge to spare the girl the
trauma of testifying.
   Johstono said the verdict affirmed that Dickey, who had no prior
criminal record, was ``a very sick individual.''
