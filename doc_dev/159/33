   Baby M is happy and secure with her
father and his wife and shows no more attachment to the surrogate
mother who refused to surrender her than she does to her
babysitter, the toddler's father testified today.
   William Stern, testifying at a court hearing over visitation
rights for surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, said he
believes his daughter should not be allowed to see Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould for several years.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who agreed to bear the child under a
$10,000 contract with Stern, currently is allowed to see the child
once a week for two hours under supervision.
   The visitation fight is the final legal phase of the court
battle involving Baby M, now Melissa Stern, who turned 2 Sunday.
The court hearing was ordered in a landmark ruling by the New
Jersey Supreme Court overturning surrogacy for pay.
   Both sides in the dispute strongly disagree over what would be
in the best interest of the girl, with the key issue centering on
whether continued contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould would be
harmful or healthy.
   The child, conceived by artificial insemination using Stern's
sperm, lives with Stern and his wife, Elizabeth, in their Tenafly
home.
   Stern likened Melissa to a young sapling that has to put down
its roots.
   ``If anything is done to interrupt her putting down those roots,
I'm afraid Melissa does not have much of a future,'' he said during
a half-hour of testimony.
   Melissa calls him ``Dada,'' and his wife, ``Mama,'' he noted.
   Stern acknowledged under cross-examination by Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Joel Siegal, that Melissa appeared to
be suffering no ill effects from her visits with Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould, and he said he would be willing to try to work out
a visitation arrangement if the court ordered one.
   ``The critical thing is that these adults can get on with their
lives, put the conflicts of the past behind them and support one
another,'' said Dr. David Brodzinsky, who acted as a
court-appointed psychologist in the widely publicized 1986 trial
that marked the first court ruling on a surrogacy contract.
   The judge in that trial barred Mrs. Whitehead-Gould from seeing
Melissa, but on Feb. 3 the state Supreme Court declared surrogacy
for pay illegal and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's parental
rights, while granting custody to the Sterns.
   The Supreme Court, in ordering today's visitation hearing, made
no specific recommendations on visitation and gave the lower court
the ``broadest powers'' to resolve the issue.
   Mental health experts who have examined Melissa say she appears
to be unaffected by the legal storm around her. She was described
as friendly with adults, while being more attached to Stern than to
her mother.
   In court papers filed last week, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould says she
wants liberal, unsupervised visitation. The Sterns are seeking a
halt to visitation for several years.
   The session before Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween is
expected to last about three days. The high court ruled that the
issue of visitation must be resolved by early May.
   In court papers, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould says she wants visitation
immediately expanded to eight hours twice a week, unsupervised at
her home in East Brunswick. She says she wants the visits
eventually to include half the summer and some holidays.
   ``Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has fashioned an excellent relationship
with Melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishing
and productive relationship,'' according to papers filed by her
attorney, Harold Cassidy.
   But the Sterns' attorney, Gary Skoloff, argues in court papers
that no contact would be better for the child because Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould does not offer a healthy environment for her,
particularly in the last year since the mother became pregnant out
of wedlock, divorced her former husband and married Wall Street
accountant Dean Gould.
   Skoloff did not spell out in the court papers how long contact
should be discontinued. In an interview, he said ``as long as
possible,'' and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys say the Sterns are
seeking a six-year moratorium on visits.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys see her divorce and remarriage
in a positive light, arguing that she has a more stable
relationship and financially secure lifestyle.
