   Two men claiming fatherhood of a 7-year-old
girl are asking the U.S. Supreme Court for a Solomon-like decision
which could affect other fathers in so-called reverse paternity
cases.
   ``This case arises out of a societal phenomenon of men assuming
the responsibility we've always told them to assume as parents,''
says attorney Larry Hoffman. The case is scheduled to be heard
Tuesday by the high court.
   In the classic paternity case, a man who denies fathering a
child out of wedlock may be forced by the courts to take financial
responsibility for the child.
   ``I consider this a double reverse paternity case,'' Hoffman
says. ``We have not one, but two, men coming forward wanting to
support and care for this child.''
   Hoffman represents a married couple, Gerald and Carole Dearing,
who are fighting a suit by Michael Hirschensohn, Mrs. Dearing's
former lover.
   Hirschensohn, who says he is the biological father of Victoria
Dearing, wants visitation rights and ``the opportunity to be
involved in the child's life,'' says his attorney, Joel Aaronson.
   ``All he wants is to be able to visit with the child and give
the child the warmth and nurturing a parent gives a child,'' says
Aaronson.
   The problem is a California law which mirrors similar statutes
in other states. It holds that a woman's legal husband, unless he
is impotent or sterile, is the father of any child born during the
marriage.
   Aaronson says the law is outdated and unfair and wants the
Supreme Court to overrule it.
   The lawyer notes the increasing role of stepfathers and
stepmothers in the lives of children of divorce and says Victoria
would not be unique among her classmates if she was sharing her
time with two fathers.
   The events which created this legal triangle reflect the
complxities of life in the 1980s. The facts acknowledged by both
lawyers are these:
   Gerald and Carole Dearing were married in 1976. There were
separations, and from 1978 to 1984 Mrs. Dearing had an intermittent
sexual affair with Hirschensohn in Los Angeles and St. Thomas in
the Virgin Islands.
   In September 1980, Mrs. Dearing became pregnant. Her husband
attended Lamaze classes with her and was present in the delivery
room when the baby was born by Caesarean section on May 11, 1981.
   ``Gerald was the proudest of fathers...,'' his lawyer's brief
states.
   But Hirschensohn says Mrs. Dearing told him soon after the
baby's birth that the infant probably was his.
   Just after Victoria's first birthday, Dearing, the U.S.
representative of a French oil company, was transferred from Los
Angeles to New York. His wife and daughter stayed behind.
   Mrs. Dearing, Hirschensohn and the child then had blood tests
which showed a 98.07 percent probability that Hirschensohn was the
father. Dearing has not had a blood test and his lawyer claims it
is irrelevant because the law says he is the father.
   In the fall of 1982, Hirschensohn sued to be named Victoria's
legal father.
   There were upheavals in the Dearing marriage, and Mrs. Dearing
and Victoria lived with Hirschensohn intermittently until April
1984, when she accused him of ``peculiar behavior'' and obtained a
restraining order to keep him away from the little girl. That June,
she reconciled with her husband in New York.
   Since then, Hoffman said, the Dearings have had another child
and a third baby is due any day.
   Hirschensohn, a businessman who divides his time between St.
Thomas and Los Angeles, has not seen Victoria again except for one
brief visit in 1986.
   Appeals courts in California have ruled against Hirschensohn,
upholding a law they say was designed to protect the integrity of
the family.
   ``Marriage is a really sacred institution in the law,'' says
Hoffman. ``This law is traceable to antiquity.''
   In California, the concept of husband as father was written into
the state's first laws in 1872. Aaronson says it's time for the
courts to respond to societal changes.
   ``We've come to the point in society where we can prove a
biological connection between people who wish to be biologically
connected,'' he says, adding,``There may be a psychological father
as well as a biological father.'' Hoffman insists the biological
link is irrelevant.
   ``We think other things mean as much or more,'' he says.
``Because a man has biological responsibility does not make him a
better father.''
