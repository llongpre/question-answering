<LEADPARA>  How many parents actually consider their children's future sexual preference
when they first have kids? Relatively few. And yet it's an issue parents will
have to face: Will their children grow up to be straight or gay? According to
sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, about one out of 10 people is gay; at least one
family in every four has a homosexual member. Children who sense early on that
they are homosexual wrestle for years with a sense of "differentness,"a sense
of secrecy that often sets them apart from others. With virtually no gay role
models to look up to, coming to terms with their own homosexuality is a long
and often difficult process. Many parents inadvertently encourage their
children to keep such secrets; they don't want to know about their kids' sex
lives -- straight or otherwise. This pressure can be overwhelming: Almost
three times as many gay teen-agers attempt suicide as their straight
counterparts. Sociologists and anthropologists have observed homosexual
behavior in all races and societies, at all times in history; and many, such
as John DeCecco, professor of psychology at San Francisco State University and
editor of the Journal of Homosexuality, maintain it is "just another form of
sexual preference." In fact, DeCecco dismisses all current research as
homophobic. Yet there has been a great deal of research done on the issue of
sexual preference.;    Some believe, as Freud did, that parents influence a
child's sexual preference.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Many others -- a growing community of well-respected researchers -- believe
people are born gay or straight, that the origins of sexual preference are
biological.;    Whatever the theories, the issue of sexual orientation is a
compelling one in our society, and many parents feel uneasy contemplating the
possibility of homosexuality in their children.;    Guilt is common reaction; 
  The initial reaction of many parents to a child's homosexuality is a sense
of guilt and a belief that it stemmed  from something they did.;    Not
surprisingly, the issue of homosexuality is clouded with myths and
misinformation.;    The early psychoanalytic theories about homosexuality,
starting in 1905 with Freud, focused on environmental causes.;    Freud
described a particular family dynamic that produced gay children as composed
of a domineering mother and a weak or absent father.;    This combination
allegedly deprived the son of a strong male role model and caused him to
over-identify with, and fail to properly separate from, his mother.;    Today,
such theories have been widely dismissed.;    A pioneering, 12-year study of
more than 1,300 men and women, both gay and straight, by psychologists Alan
Bell, Martin Weinberg and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith at the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University in Bloomington,
looked at both groups' relationships with their mothers. They found the
connection between these relationships and the subjects' sexual orientation
"hardly worth mentioning.";    But a few psychoanalysts -- among them Dr.
Charles Socarides, clinical professor of psychiatry at New York's Albert
Einstein College of Medicine -- do believe in nurture over nature.;   
Socarides' controversial belief is that homosexuality is brought about by a
"disturbance in gender-defined self-identity" that takes place while the child
is under 3 years of age. Such a "disturbance" prevents the child from going
through the developmental steps that would lead him to have sexual feelings
for the opposite sex.;    Yet even psychologists who dismiss his theory
concede early childhood factors may play a part, if not in determining
homosexuality, then possibly in encouraging or discouraging its expression.;  
 For example, parents who wanted a girl might unconsciously let their feelings
influence their behavior toward a son.;    Another example is the boy whose
apparently "sissy" ways and his dislike of sports disappoint, and even repel,
his father; the child might cling more to his mother.;    Indeed, more
research points to the role of the father in these strained relationships.;   
Several studies on the homosexual development of boys outline poor
relationships between homosexual sons and their fathers.;    Dr. Richard
Green, in his ground-breaking book "The Sissy Boy Syndrome and the Development
of Homosexuality" (Yale University Press, 1987), compares the development of
44 "effeminate" boys with a control group of "masculine" boys.;    A
significant number of the effeminate boys' fathers recalled spending less time
with their sons than did fathers in the other group.;    Another researcher
who has observed important reverberations in the father/son relationship is
Dr. Richard Isay, clinical professor of psychiatry at Cornell Medical College
in New York City and author of "Being Homosexual: Gay Men and Their
Development" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1989).;    Based on years of clinical
work with gay men, Isay has observed that as children, gay males seem to have
a particular need for closeness with their fathers -- a closeness often denied
because the father senses they are atypical.;    Isay, however, is firm in his
belief that children are born with this attraction for the same sex.;     The
seduction theory;  It is a commonly held belief that children can be "seduced"
into homosexuality; that a sexual encounter with an older person at a
formative stage can determine a child's sexual orientation for life.;    Not
so, say many of today's experts, insisting homosexuality is an innate drive,
not learned behavior.;    Anthropologist Gilbert Herdt, chairman of the
committee on human development at the University of Chicago, says: "There is
no evidence that someone's sexual identity can be permanently influenced by
another person.";  The biology theory;  It is the widely reported early sense
of difference that many gay men and women report, some believe, that seems to
indicate the origins of homosexuality are biological.;    And new studies have
uncovered various sets of factors that come into play either at birth or even
before, while the baby is still in utero, that may in time prove this.;    One
study by Lee Ellis, professor of sociology at Minot State University in North
Dakota, suggests homosexuality may be caused by stress experienced by the
mother during pregnancy.;    Extrapolating from data derived from studies on
laboratory rats, Ellis asked the mothers of 283 college-age children to recall
whether they had experienced stress during the pregnancy and at what stage.;  
 "We found mothers of the 39 homosexual males reported significantly more
severe stress during pregnancy -- all said it was in the second trimester,"
says Ellis.;    The reason maternal stress might play a part in a fetus'
sexual development, Ellis and other researchers believe, is that under stress
the body releases a particular set of hormones.;    "If these stress hormones
get to the fetus they can affect its brain in a way that temporarily stops the
production of sex hormones," Ellis explains.;     Many manifestations;  Just
as there may be many different explanations for homosexuality, so are there
many manifestations of it.;    As types, gay men range from very effeminate to
very masculine.;    Will your son grow up to be gay if he shows very
effeminate behavior, such as identifying only with girls? Possibly.;    The
consensus today is that real homosexual orientation -- as opposed to
homosexual behavior -- cannot be changed and trying to do this is both futile
and damaging to a child's self-esteem.;    But with the advent of AIDS and the
rise of discrimination and attacks on gays, there is no doubt homosexuality is
still regarded as a social stigma.;    How do parents get past their bias and
support their kids' individual impulses? By reminding themselves that "the
most important thing a parent can give a child is self-esteem," Reinisch
says.;    "Whatever our kids' sexual orientation," Reinisch says, "the
majority of parents want them to be happy and productive, to fall in love and
make a commitment -- to have a successful life. A successful life is not
something we can define by our own terms."  </TEXT>
