   A divorced father is helping to make a
movie about his seven-year custody-visitation battle over his
daughters, but the girls' mother has gone to court in hopes of
stopping what she sees as exploitation.
   Don Chavez, president of the National Congress for Men in
Washington and founder of the Albuquerque-based Dads Against
Discrimination, said the movie will be about ``Dad trying to regain
a meaningful place in the lives of his children.''
   The plot has a father organizing a group of other fathers in the
same situation in an attempt to change the way judges award custody
and visitation rights.
   ``What fathers do not see coming is the reality of getting
laundered from their children or emotionally amputated from their
children when they get divorced from their wives, and that's what
happened to me,'' Chavez said. ``And so the story starts with that
kind of a loving father who struggles for the better part of a
decade to regain his status as a real parent.
   ``A real parent does not mean being Uncle dad or a Disneyland
dad who visits with his children on weekends.''
   The girls' mother, Marilyn Chavez Newhouse, has asked state
District Judge Robert Thompson to appoint a guardian to determine
if the movie is in their best interest and to decide how to protect
them from future publicity.
   Daughters Leticia, 13, and Michelle, 11, live with Chavez, 38, a
Bureau of Indian Affairs administrator, during the school year and
with their remarried mother during the summer.
   Mrs. Newhouse contends in her petition that Chavez, who also has
remarried, failed to consult with her about ``the effect or
advisability of exposing the children to additional media
exploitation.''
   Chavez said Mrs. Newhouse won't communicate with him except
through their attorneys. He said his daughters favor the idea of a
movie.
   Chavez would not say what production company is making the film,
and said he's unsure when the movie will be ready because of delays
caused first by the writers' strike and now by the Hollywood
Teamsters' strike.
