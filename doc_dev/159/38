   A parent may consent on behalf of a
child to donate bone marrow to a sibling, but only when it would be
in the child's best interest, the Illinois Supreme Court said
Thursday.
   Justices made the ruling to explain their decision Sept. 28 to
uphold a judge's order refusing to force a leukemia victim's young
half-siblings to be tested as potentially life-saving bone-marrow
donors.
   The leukemia victim, 13-year-old Jean-Pierre Bosze, died Nov. 19
at his home in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates after a
two-year illness.
   In dealing with that case, the high court cited three factors
that must be weighed in future cases to determine when a parent or
guardian can approve a child's being a transplant donor:
   -The parent or guardian must be informed of the risks and
benefits inherent in the donation.
   -Emotional support must be available to the child from his
caretakers.
   -A close relationship must exist between the donor and
recipient.
   ``The evidence clearly shows that there is no physical benefit
to a donor child,'' wrote Justice Harold Calvo for the court's
majority. ``If there is any benefit to a child who donates bone
marrow to a sibling it will be a psychological benefit.''
   Calvo said the psychological benefit is grounded firmly in the
fact that the donor and recipient know each other as family.
   Jean-Pierre's father, Tamas Bosze, had petitioned for a court
ruling to force Nancy Curran - his former girlfriend and the mother
of Jean-Pierre's twin half-siblings - to have the 3-year-olds
tested as possible donors.
   Attorneys for the father and a court-appointed guardian for
Jean-Pierre had urged the justices to order the testing of the
twins on the legal theory that if the twins were adults, they would
agree to it.
   However, the high court refused to apply the legal doctrine of
substituted judgment. No dissents were filed.
   ``Because each twin is only 3{ years of age, neither has yet had
the opportunity to develop `actual, specific express intent,' or
any form of intent, with regard to serving as a bone marrow
donor,'' Calvo said.
   Edward Jordan, an attorney for the father, said he was
disappointed the court rejected his arguments, but optimistic about
cases to come.
   ``We have established a framework that can save lives in the
future,'' he said.
   Charles Fleck, the court-appointed guardian for the twins,
applauded the justices for taking a common sense approach.
   ``They didn't want to get into a `Brave New World' situation
where people start taking minors to save the life of Mother Teresa
or the president or somebody else,'' he said. ``They focused on the
best interests of the minor.''
