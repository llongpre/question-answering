   A couple won't seek custody of a 10-year-old
girl they believe is their daughter, but they still want genetic
testing done to determine whether they are her real parents, their
lawyer said Friday.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., would settle for a
chance to visit with the girl, and make her part of their family,
said John Blakely, the Twiggs' attorney.
   ``They were becoming very frustrated with the public's
perception. They have always intended to do what is best for
everyone,'' said Blakely.
   The Twiggs filed a lawsuit last year seeking genetic testing of
the girl, Kimberly Mays. The girl's father, Robert Mays, a roofing
supply salesman from Sarasota, is fighting to block the tests.
   The Twiggs claim they brought the wrong child home from Hardee
Memorial Hospital in Wauchula in 1978, and that Robert and Barbara
Mays took their child the same day.
   The girl the Twiggs raised, named Arlena, died of a congenital
heart defect last August. They learned through blood tests that she
was not their daughter.
   Kimberly and Arlena were the only two white baby girls in the
hospital at the same time. The Twiggs, who maintain hospital
personnel deliberately switched their healthy daughter for a sickly
child, have asked a Sarasota court to order genetic testing to
determine Kimberly's parentage.
   ``This doesn't change the lawsuit at all,'' Blakely said.
   In December, Mays said Kimberly inscribed a drawing she gave him
for Christmas: ``I hate the Twiggs. I want them to go away.''
   Mays' wife, Barbara, died of cancer in 1981. He remarried and
later divorced.
   Mrs. Twigg said she and her husband first considered seeking
custody because they suspected Mays participated in the alleged baby
swap, but now there is no evidence to support that.
   The Twiggs, who have seven children, later grew concerned about
public sentiment that they were being unfair to Kimberly. They say
they have received hate mail comparing them to terrorists.
   ``You take a step back and say, `What is in the best interest of
everybody involved?''' Mrs. Twigg told The Tampa Tribune in an
interview published in Friday editions, breaking four months of
silence in the case. ``We feel that we should not be denied the
right to know that girl as a child.''
   Blakely said while there have been no discussions with Mays or
his attorney, Arthur Ginsburg, the Twiggs should be the ones to
determine extent of the visitation, relying on guidance from
psychologists and psychiatrists.
   ``I think the only basis the Twiggs would seek custody is if some
professional told them it would be in Kimberly's best interest to
remove her from Mr. May's house, which we do not anticipate,'' said
Blakely.
   Ginsburg was not available Friday, his office said. Mays could
not be reached; he has an unpublished telephone number.
