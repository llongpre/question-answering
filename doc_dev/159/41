<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- I will not be able to sleep until I respond to "Uneasy Mother" who
was molested by her father. Her mother knew but did nothing to protect her.
She moved out of the house when she turned 18, got therapy and went on to be a
fairly well-adjusted person.;   After a while, she was able to forgive her
father and wrote to tell you that they now have a very pleasant relationship.
Her question: Should she allow her two young daughters to spend the night at
Grandpa and Grandma's house? Her parents keep asking and the little girls
would like to.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Your correspondent thought it possible her father was over his "problem."
He's in his 60s now and besides, her mother is always there.;   Your response
was, "Absolutely not. Your mother didn't protect you -- what makes you think
she would protect your daughters?";   I was abused by my stepfather and I,
too, moved out when I turned 18. After a few years, I resumed the relationship
for my mother's sake and was ready to let bygones be bygones. My daughter was
then 18 months old.;   I convinced myself (and my husband) that my stepfather
would never touch our daughter, and I allowed her to sleep at Grandma and
Grandpa's house on many occasions. My mother died in 1985 and a few years
later, my stepfather was arrested for sexual molestation. His way of dealing
with the problem was to commit suicide. Meanwhile, my daughter, who is now 20,
has been hospitalized in a psychiatric unit several times. There is no doubt
in my mind that she was sexually abused by my stepfather.;   I am trying hard
to come to terms with my guilt for exposing my daughter to this man.;   --
J.T. in Virginia; DEAR J.T. -- Thanks for a fine letter. There were thousands
on this subject, all with a similar message. Read on:;   This is for that
idiot woman who was sexually abused by her father and isn't sure whether to
allow her small daughters to spend the night at her parents' home. For Lord's
sake, lady, you would have to be crazy to take such a chance. Don't you know
sexual abusers are forever a risk? Don't do it.;   -- Toronto;   Forty years
ago my father molested my sister. He was always drunk when he did this. My
sister finally told a neighbor. The neighbor told my mother, who divorced my
father promptly. He cleaned up his act and remarried. He also quit drinking
and we became a family again.;   I wish this was the end of the story, but it
isn't. He went on to sexually molest my daughters and my nieces. How foolish I
was to believe a molester could change. I will carry the guilt to my dying
day.;   -- Otis, Ore.;   DEAR READERS -- Victims of child abuse must get
counseling. Please send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to V.O.I.C.E.S.
(Victims of Incest Can Emerge Survivors) at P.O. Box 148309, Chicago, Ill.
