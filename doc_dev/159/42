<LEADPARA>  WHEN Cathy Hicks was drifting toward her third divorce last year, she kept
telling herself l,2p it would be best for the kids.;    "I've always thought
that if parents can't bring a child up in a happy home, everyone is better off
if there's a divorce," says Hicks, 40, of Crystal Lake, Ill. She has a
19-year-old daughter by her first husband ,1p7 and 12-year-old son by her
second.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Until recently, she wouldn't have gotten much argument from psychologists,
sociologists, marriage counselors, family scholars. The United States has
always been the most divorce-prone society in the l,0p2 world, and as rates
started to soar in the mid-1960s, a good deal of elite opinion focused more on
the expansion in freedom for adults than on the possible harm to children of
broken marriages.;    "I think we were all real naive for a while in thinking
that divorce did not have a serious impact on kids," says Anna Beth
Benningfield, president-elect of the American Association for Marriage and
Family Therapy (AAMFT), which has been debating whether counselors should
bring a more anti-divorce bias to therapy. "But I'd say the bloom is off the
rose.";    The second look has been triggered by new studies that show the
harmful effects of divorce on children are

6,1p6,1p8,1p10,2p1,3p,3p3,4p4 lasting than once had been thought. Children of
divorce perform less well in school, have more behavioral and psychological
problems and a greater tendency (once they become adults) to divorce than
children raised by both biological parents.;    To be sure, domestic violence
and other problems of high-conflict marriages are damaging to children and
even experts intent on saving marriages acknowledge divorce is sometimes the
best alternative.;    "We want to be careful not to say that every child who
has been through a divorce will be scarred for life . . . or that every child
raised in a traditional two-parent family will turn out fine," says Nicholas
Zill, executive director of Child Trends Inc., a Washington-based firm that
does research on children's issues.;    "But if you looked at the kind of
long-term risk factors that divorce creates for kids and translated them to,
say, heart disease, people would be startled," he says.;    "For years experts
said, 'Once the initial trauma wears off, kids make adjustments.' Well, so do
people in prisons and mental institutions," says John Guidubaldi, a psychology
professor at Kent State University and past president of the National
Association of School Psychologists. "The pertinent question is: Are those
adjustments healthy? The weight; of the evidence has become overwhelming on
the side that they aren't.";    Guidubaldi argues laws and mores have gone too
far in sanctioning no-fault, no-guilt divorce.;    "People simply aren't
putting enough effort into saving their marriages," he says. "I think the old
argument of staying together for the sake of the kids is still the best
argument.";    'Divorce-Buster';    Such views are still controversial. But in
the past few years, a rally-'round-marriage movement has begun to stir among
psychologists who worry about the impact of divorce on children, legal
scholars who argue a children-first policy should be written into divorce law,
and marriage counselors who have come to believe divorce is a cure worse than
the disease.;    One sign of the times was the title of the keynote address at
the annual meeting of the 17,000 member AAMFT last fall: "Divorce-Buster.";   
"I'm passionate about saving marriages," says Michele Weiner-Davis, a
Woodstock, Ill., family therapist who delivered the address. Her modus
operandi, she explains, is to "concentrate on what works in a couple's
marriage rather than on what doesn't.";    When Cathy and Jerry Hicks came in
to see her last fall, Weiner-Davis instructed them to draw up a list of the
things they did together that made them happiest, then rearrange their daily
routines so they did those things as often as possible. She told them to
negotiate a specific number of hours each weekend that Jerry would do
housework, which had been a source of friction.;    And she suggested that if
Cathy felt she needed to ask questions about past conflicts that had led her
to the brink of divorce, such conversations should have a half-hour time
limit.;    "A lot of her homework exercises seemed sort of silly, but it
turned out to be exactly what we needed," says Jerry, an executive with a
telecommunications company. "I feel more committed to our marriage than I ever
have," says Cathy.;    Not all cases have such happy endings; nor is there any
guarantee that there aren't rough patches ahead for the Hicks. But
Weiner-Davis is convinced counselors can -- and should -- make a difference in
keeping marriages together.;    The scapegoat;    This is causing conflict
within the therapeutic community. Classical clinical training teaches
counselors to be bias-free; to help clients do whatever seems most appropriate
given their particular circumstances. "The trouble with therapists trying to
impose their values on clients is that it's the clients who have to live with
the consequences," says Benningfield, the AAMFT president-elect.;    "Divorce
has become a scapegoat, the easy sacrificial institution on which to lay blame
for many of society's problems," says Constance Ahrons, a Southern California
therapist who spoke at the AAMFT conference in response to Weiner-Davis. She
says divorce is "often a pathway to a happier life.";    Weiner-Davis counters
that there is no such thing as value-free counseling. "We declare our biases
by the questions we choose to ask," she says. "For a therapist to be neutral
when someone is about to jump off a building -- that's not neutrality," adds
Frank Pittman, a therapist from Atlanta and another staunch marriage-saver. "I
have always felt that people who are in crisis make bad decisions. It is
foolhardy to expect otherwise. It's our job to give them a reality check.";   
These "reality checks" may already be rippling through the culture. After
doubling from 1965 to 1980, divorce rates have leveled off at about 10 percent
below their peak of a decade ago. Some analysts attribute the decline to the
fear of AIDS; others to the aging of much of the baby-boom generation out of
their 20s -- the high-risk divorce years.;    But some speculate that the
research on long-term consequences of divorce has led to social learning.
"I've had family therapists all over the country tell me they have couples
coming in for counseling with my book tucked under their arm and a look of
concern on their faces," says Judith S. Wallerstein of Corte Madera, whose
best-selling 1989 book, "Second Chances: Men, Women and Children a Decade
After Divorce," popularized the alarmist view of the impact of divorce on
children.;    Among other findings, the study by Wallerstein and Sandra
Blakeslee of 60 middle-class divorced families in Marin County showed that
while boys are apt to experience the greatest trauma at the time of divorce
and suffer most from the father-absence that typically follows divorce, girls
are more prone to a "sleeper effect" that makes it difficult for them to
establish stable male-female relationships once they become adults.;    An
ongoing decade-long study by Guidubaldi of 699 families in 38 states has shown
children of divorce are more likely than children in traditional, intact
families to engage in drug abuse, violent behavior, suicide and out-of-wedlock
child bearing. A study by Zill for the National Institute of Mental Health
showed that, once they become adolescents, children who were under age 7 when
their parents were divorced were three times more likely to be receiving
psychological counseling and five times more likely to have been suspended or
expelled from school than children of intact families.;    Critics of these
studies note that when one compares children of divorce to children of
conflict-ridden families, the results are murkier. Zill counters that only
about 15 percent of marriages involve violence or high levels of conflict, but
roughly 50 percent of marriages end in divorce. "There is no question that
persistent conflict in marriage is bad for children, but a lot of divorces
don't fall in that category," he says.;    Marriage counselors aren't the only
professionals who are reappraising divorce. Harvard professor Mary Ann Glendon
has proposed an overhaul of divorce laws to assure that, in the 60 percent of
all divorces involving minor children, "A judge's main task would be to piece
together, from property and income and in-kind personal care, the best
possible package to meet the needs of children and their physical custodian.";
   No state has language like that in its divorce code. Studies show that
following a divorce, children and their custodial parent -- typically their
mother -- see their standard of living drop sharply, while non-custodial
parents see theirs rise.;    Others have called for a cooling-off period to be
built into divorce proceedings when children are involved, and -- in the most
draconian proposal of the burgeoning divorce-buster movement -- historian and
author Christopher Lasch has called for a constitutional amendment that would
forbid parents with minor children from divorcing.;    Will the new activism
on the anti-divorce front change people's behavior?;    "I may be wildly and
foolishly optimistic," says Zill, "but as more information gets out that we
have yet to find a good substitute for the traditional two-parent family, I
think a change is bound to occur.";    "Divorce is here to stay," counters
Ahrons, a marriage counselor who looks askance at the divorce-buster movement.
"We ought to help people learn how to manage it, which is not an easy thing."  </TEXT>
