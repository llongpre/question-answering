<P>
A young Glendale man found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the killing his 
father was sentenced Friday to three years on probation by a Pasadena Superior 
Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the probation, Arnel Salvatierra, 20, promised to undergo 
regular psychiatric counseling. Salvatierra was 17 when he shot his father, 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatierra's sentencing had been delayed for almost three months after his 
attorneys requested time for three psychologists to examine him. Under 
California law, a minor convicted in Superior Court must be examined by a 
court-approved diagnostic expert before he can be sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatierra has been free on his own recognizance since Dec. 30, when a jury 
found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the lesser of two charges in the 
shooting. He was acquitted of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing hearing before Judge Gilbert C. Alston, Salvatierra's 
attorney, Marcia Morrissey, called the sentence "appropriate." She said the 2 
1/2 years her client spent in custody in Juvenile Hall in Eastlake had 
rehabilitated him. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Wondries, who prosecuted the case, called 
Salvatierra "a very dangerous kid." She said Salvatierra only began receiving 
counseling four months ago, when he was released from custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Arnel has made a great deal of progress, but Arnel is a long way from being 
rehabilitated," Wondries said. "All the experts agree that Arnel needs 
intensive psychological counseling." 
</P>
<P>
The January, 1986, slaying of Oscar Salvatierra attracted international 
attention when it was disclosed that, on the day before his death, he had 
received a written death threat. Police at first suggested that the threat 
might be related to the Filipino newspaper he worked for being critical of 
then-President Ferdinand Marcos. But authorities later disclosed that his son 
had made the threat. 
</P>
<P>
During his three-week trial, Arnel Salvatierra testified that his father had 
abused him. He admitted that he had planned the slaying for weeks before 
shooting his father in the head while he was sleeping in the family's north 
Glendale home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living With Mother 
</P>
<P>
Arnel Salvatierra has been living with his mother, two sisters and a brother 
since January and is a student at a Los Angeles-area college, Morrissey said. 
She would not disclose the name of the college. 
</P>
<P>
On April 7, Theresa K. DeBurger of Glendale -- Arnel Salvatierra's 
then-girlfriend, who was accused of hiding the clothing he wore when he killed 
his father -- was sentenced to two years' probation and fined $715. Last year, 
DeBurger pleaded no contest to being an accessory after the fact in the 
slaying.
