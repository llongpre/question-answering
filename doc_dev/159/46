   Off-Broadway's Second Stage, founded, like a
thrift shop, to give good products a second home, is increasingly
turning to the presentation of new plays.
   The latest effort is ``Jersey City,'' which opened Wednesday
night. Its protagonists are two adolescents, damaged by childhood
traumas, trying to become adults.
   The girl, Magaly, has been forced into incest by her father
since she was 5. The boy, David, had his father taken away and
found his brother's body after a shooting in the streets of San
Salvador.
   They run away and meet in Jersey City, N.J.
   The play, written by Wendy Hammond, moves with realism and
suspendse to a hope-filled ending. Ms. Hammond has had two previous
plays done outside New York.
   The story begins in Brooklyn, with Magaly's never-visible mother
working nights and father slapping and knocking her into
submission. Then he rapes her. Sex scenes are done with actors
clothed or partly clothed.
   Magaly and David are impossibly nice and well-adjusted,
considering what they've been through. This makes the play easier
for the audience to take.
   But their problems aren't glossed over. Esther, a bar dancer who
sends Magaly home with David to escape her father's pursuit, also
is impossibly nice. But her problems as a mother of two children
with different fathers are real.
   Megaly and David fall in love, but she remains troubled by her
past. She has nightmares. And she can't make love without being hit.
   She eventually finds free counseling.
   The playwright has simplified their problems, focusing on the
psychological harm wrought by child abuse and shock.
   The acting was first-rate, by two ``Sesame Street'' veterans,
Alison Bartlett as Magaly and Eddie Castrodad as David, Jude
Ciccolella as Pa and Adina Porter as Esther.
   The director was Risa Bramon, a member of the Ensemble Studio
Theater.
