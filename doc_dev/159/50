   Only his head and shoulders were visible
above the witness box as the boy calmly told a murder trial jury
how, when he was 2 years and 10 months old, he watched as his aunt
was grabbed and thrown down by a man with a knife.
   ``I saw a knife in his case on his belt _ I thought it was a
gun,'' the boy said softly, recounting events that took place eight
years ago. ``She was, like, pulling around his shoulders and pushing
him away from her.''
   From divorce battles to child abuse cases to murder trials, child
witnesses, once rarely seen in court, are appearing regularly in
thousands of proceedings, legal and psychiatric experts said.
   Opinion varies widely on the reliability of child witnesses and
on whether the stress they suffer in a courtroom is worth the
testimony they provide. Psychiatrists cite symptoms like nightmares,
confusion and guilt in young witnesses.
   ``It's not that difficult at all to get a child to say `nay' to
questions the child was saying `yea' to a few minutes before,''
defense attorney Frank Mondano, who was involved in a child abuse
case against a Massachusetts day care center, said of
cross-examining children.
   ``You don't know whether they are with you or in a childlike
world.''
   Prosecutors said the testimony of the 11-year-old boy in
Middlesex Superior Court last month was critical in the murder case
against William Brown, who was accused of stabbing the boy's
12-year-old aunt to death. But the boy couldn't positively identify
Brown as the attacker, the jury failed to reach a verdict, and the
case must be retried.
   Many methods have been used to smooth the road for child
witnesses. Some have been struck down as unconstitutional, others
have withstood appeals.
   In Minnesota, a child frozen with fear was permitted to testify
from beneath the prosecutor's table.
   In Philadelphia, a 5-year-old used a doll to demonstrate how her
father allegedly beat her younger sister. As a hushed courtroom
watched, the girl tossed the doll in the air. After it landed on the
floor, the girl walked down from the witness stand and began
punching it in the stomach.
   ``Where child victims used to be rare, now you're seeing many
more children coming into the system and that has required making
some accommodations,'' said Jane Walsh, a Middlesex County assistant
district attorney who has worked on many child abuse cases.
   Other changes include mandatory psychiatric evaluations before a
child is allowed to testify; special training for judges handling
child witnesses; and victim-witness advocates in prosecutors'
offices who work with families to make the experience less stressful.
   ``Children are quite honest,'' said Dr. Robert Nardone, head of
New England Medical Center's child psychology center, who frequently
evaluates potential child witnesses.
   ``If they are giving you an accurate version, they are
consistent,'' he said. ``A lot of people are concerned they are
being prepped. You usually can tell.''
   The stress associated with testifying can be especially acute
when a child is asked to give evidence against a parent or other
relative in a child abuse case, said Dr. Alayne Yates, chief of
child psychiatry at the University of Arizona.
   Problems can include ``staying awake at night, ruminating about
what they said and feeling responsible for the person being in
prison, and very sorry,'' she said.
   The younger the witness, the more acute the stress, said Yates,
adding that when she began her career in 1973 such cases were
``extraordinarily rare.''
   The number of child abuse cases nationwide has more than tripled
in a decade, according to the American Association for Protecting
Children, a Denver-based organization.
   In 1976 there were 669,000 cases but by 1986 the number jumped to
2.1 million. Of those, about 40 percent are ``substantiated'' to the
point where they may be brought to trial, said association
researcher Brandon Ruiz.
   In most of those trials, the testimony of the child victim is
required to prosecute the case.
   Judges are less willing to put children through the trauma of
testimony in divorce and custody battles than in criminal cases, but
children are often asked to take sides in a battle between parents.
Parents sometimes falsely accuse one another of sexual abuse to win
custody, Yates said.
   ``The child is liable to lose contact with a father who's a
valuable parent and sometimes whether the abuse happened or not,
they come to the feeling that it must have happened,'' she said.
