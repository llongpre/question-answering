   A man whose ex-wife went to jail rather than
let him see their children surrendered to authorities today after
being indicted on a charge of sexually assaulting his daughter.
   Mark Russell Murabito, 33, of Derry, was awaiting arraignment in
Rockingham County Superior Court after turning himself in to the
county sheriff.
   A grand jury indicted Murabito on a charge of felonious sexual
assault against his daughter, now 5 years old, County Attorney
Carleton Eldredge said Tuesday.
   Eldredge said the indictment was ``based upon a course of
conduct'' since March 1987, when a Superior Court judge found no
evidence to back Jesse Murabito's allegations that her husband
molested their daughter.
   Eldredge did not elaborate on the indictment. As a condition of
bail, Eldredge said he will ask that Murabito be barred from seeing
his children.
   In his 19-page divorce decree last March, Judge Douglas Gray
admonished both parents to stop ``tearing (the children) to
pieces,'' and granted Murabito unsupervised visitation with the
girl and her brother, now 3{.
   Murabito's lawyer, Raymond Kellett, said Tuesday his client will
plead innocent to any such charges. ``It is evident that (Mrs.
Murabito) will do anything and everything to keep the children from
Mr. Murabito,'' Kellett said.
   Mrs. Murabito said Tuesday the case ``is not Murabito versus
Murabito. This is the state of New Hampshire versus Mr. Murabito.''
She declined further comment.
   The indictment is a turning point in Mrs. Murabito's nearly
two-year struggle to convince the courts and child welfare
officials that her ex-husband was molesting their daughter.
   Gray could not be reached for comment Tuesday evening; there was
no home telephone listing in New Hampshire under his name.
   In February 1987, Gray jailed Mrs. Murabito, now 39, after she
hid the children in defiance of a court order to let her husband
see the children during supervised visits.
   A week later, he released her after she agreed to allow
supervised visits pending a hearing.
   In the subsequent order of March 20, 1987, in which Murabito was
granted unsupervised visits, Gray said Mrs. Murabito and experts
she called as witnesses during a seven-day hearing had failed to
prove allegations that Murabito sexually abused the daughter after
Mrs. Murabito sought a divorce in late 1985.
   ``Of course the possibility exists that the court is wrong, but
that possibility exists in any judicial fact-finding process,''
Gray wrote, but to uphold the abuse allegations ``would be to
engage in blatant speculation.''
   Gray said Mrs. Murabito's chief witness, the children's
psychiatrist since spring 1986, based many of her assertions on
hearsay. Mrs. Murabito had said she contacted the psychiatrist when
she noticed the children were losing sleep and weight and becoming
irritable.
   Gray cited an evaluation of the children by a court-appointed
psychologist as ``by far the more clinically neutral and detached.''
   The psychologist found no evidence of sexual abuse and said
actions by the father that had been construed by others as abuse
could be interpreted otherwise.
