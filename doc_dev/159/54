   Judges shouldn't be so quick to order
couples in bitter divorces to share custody of their children,
because the arrangement can do more harm than good to the
youngsters, a researcher said Thursday.
   Far too often, said psychologist Judith Wallerstein, the courts
are ``putting children in the middle of the battlefield.''
   Wallerstein, head of the Center for the Family in Transition,
helped conduct a study of joint custody arrangements, which have
become increasingly popular in recent years.
   Findings from the study were presented here Wednesday at the
annual meeting of the American Orthopsychiatric Association.
   Researchers at the non-profit research and counseling center,
located in Corte Madera, studied the children of 100 couples who
went through bitter divorces and had custody arrangements decided
by the courts. In about one-third of those cases, joint custody was
ordered.
   Researchers assessed the psychological health of the children by
testing, interviews and talks with their parents, and found that
children were psychologically worse off _ more depressed, withdrawn
and uncommunicative _ if joint custody was imposed.
   The researchers also studied 93 children whose parents parted
amicably and chose their own custody arrangements. Again, about
one-third of the cases involved joint custody.
   Children in that group were not affected by custody
arrangements, the study found.
   In all, 33 states have enacted legislation that permits courts
to order joint custody, evidence of the growing trend in its favor,
Wallerstein said.
   ``It's very important for children of divorces to maintain a
continuous relationship with both parents, but that doesn't have to
be with the child going back and forth,'' Wallerstein said Thursday
in an interview.
   ``What's important is the relationship'' between parent and
child, she said. ``It is quality of relationship sustained over
time.''
   Jeremy Fogel, supervising judge for Family Court in Santa Clara
County, said the study confirmed his observations. ``An equal time
share will not solve the problems of a very conflicted relationship
between parents,'' Fogel said.
   A family law attorney in Oakland, Carole H. Rochlin, said he
fears some people may use the findings to argue against joint
custody.
   ``We'd get back to the days where either one parent or the other
has custody _ where we had these destructive custody fights,'' said
Rochlin. He heads a group called Equal Rights for Fathers, which
favors joint custody.
