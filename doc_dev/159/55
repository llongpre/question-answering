   Experimenting with drugs can be a sign of
normal adolescent development, says a new study that calls into
question the ``just say no'' appeal to shun drugs altogether.
   Adolescents who experiment with drugs tend to be better adjusted
than abstainers or abusers, according to the findings by
psychologists Jonathan Shedler and Jack Block of the University of
California, Berkeley.
   The researchers' conclusion that self-control may be more
critical than abstinence conflicts with the ``Just Say No''
anti-drug campaign. But some peers agreed Tuesday that casual drug
use does not always lead to addiction.
   ``This may be hard for some people to take, but the real issue
is knowing when to put the brakes on,'' said Dr. Shirley Feldman,
deputy director of Stanford University's Center for Study of
Family, Children and Youth.
   ``There's a whole big world out there and, psychologically
speaking, experimentation is healthy in most youths.''
   Shedler said the findings from the research, which tracked 101
San Francisco youths from age 3 to 18, ``absolutely do not mean
drug experimentation is something that is beneficial.''
   ``But it does mean that some limited drug experimentation may
not be catastrophic,'' he said. ``It could be a sign of trouble to
come or simply a sign of normal adolescent exploration.''
   The study, published in the May issue of American Psychologists,
found drug abuse is a symptom of deep-seated psychological problems
originating in early childhood and is worsened by indifferent
parenting.
   At age 18, those who used at least marijuana once a week were
alienated, lacking in ability to control their impulses and
distressed compared with experimenters, the study said. Abstainers
at that age were anxious, emotionally constricted and lacking in
social skills compared with experimenters, or teen-agers who used
marijuana or another illegal drug no more than once a month.
   Those same psychological and behavioral traits were reported
when the children were studied at ages 5, 7 and 11, according to
the continuing research. The study group is now age 23.
   Brian Flay, director of drug prevention research in the public
health department of the University of Illinois, said, ``The `Just
Say No' campaign has always been off the mark.''
   ``We can't stop kids from trying everything,'' Flay said. ``The
`Just Say No' campaign is extremely simplistic. It should be,
`Learn how to moderate your behavior. Learn how to resist the
pressure to go overboard.'''
   Some psychologists, including Shedler, contend a more effective
anti-drug effort would identify children who have traits that
signal possible drug problems later in life, and then counsel those
``at risk'' youths.
   ``Nobody can predict absolutely who's going to abuse drugs, but
we can talk about risk factors that are pretty good indicators,''
Shedler said.
   Among the factors identified by the study, the mothers of
frequent drug users and abstainers were ``perceived to be cold,
critical, pressuring and unresponsive to their children's needs,''
the researchers said.
   The study found no noteworthy findings involving fathers of
frequent drug users. But fathers of abstainers were ``relatively
unresponsive to their children's needs'' and were domineering.
   About two-thirds of the 18-year-olds in the study had tried
marijuana, which is consistent with national figures. Few got
involved with harder drugs, although those who did have ``great
problems,'' according to Shedler.
   Some researchers have credited anti-drug education with a
decline in illegal drug use among young people.
   A 1989 survey of college students found that 36.7 percent used
an illicit drug at least once during the previous year, compared
with 56.2 percent in 1980, when the survey began. Drug use among
high school seniors dropped from 65.6 percent in 1981 to 50.9
percent last year.
   ``This reduced demand is attributable largely to the important
changes occurring in the attitudes, beliefs and social norms among
our young people,'' said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan
social scientist who helped conduct the survey.
