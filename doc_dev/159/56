<LEADPARA>  CELEBRITIES are doing it: Susan Sarandon with Timothy Robbins, Farrah Fawcett
with Ryan O'Neal, and most recently, Annette Bening with Warren Beatty.
Choosing motherhood without marriage.;   And the trend is no less popular for
non-celebrity women. Although no figures exist for the number of women
choosing to have babies alone, the National Center for Health Statistics
reports the birth rate among unmarried women age 30-39 increased about 68
percent from 1980 to 1989.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It is enough to make you wonder: Who are all these women, and what will
this "new motherhood" mean?;   Single-parent networks;   "They are not
rejects, but strong, confident and secure women," says Jane Mattes, a social
worker who chose single motherhood. Ten years ago she founded the national,
non-profit network Single Mothers by Choice, which offers support, information
and referrals. Mattes and psychologist Paul Ciborowski are conducting the
first long-term national study of the women in the network's support groups,
sponsored by the Center for the Changing Family in Rochester, N.Y.;  
Preliminary findings show the women in these groups tend to be 35 or older,
middle class, well-educated and fairly well off (their median income, at
$40,000, is well above national figures). Some are lesbian, but the majority
are heterosexual. Almost all have only one child.;   The choices for the
father vary from the most anonymous (sperm-bank donor or adoption) to
committed partners. The majority of women had little or no contact with the
biological father six months after the birth.;   Whether that fatherlessness
will harm the child is a critical question. It's not an ideal environment. Yet
what's important for children is that they feel wanted, that their parents are
happy with their lives and that the household is peaceful.;   Pitfalls and
problems;   "And baby makes two" sounds romantic, but there are potential
problems and necessary, voluminous preparations. It's hard enough bringing up
a child with a partner to help, much less alone, which is why only half of the
women who go to the network's meetings considering the route go ahead with
it.;   The biggest burden: money.;   Easy enough for Fawcett and Sarandon and
Bening to spend big bucks, from day care to college. Examine your budget. What
are you willing to sacrifice?;   An emotional and social support system also
is crucial. Single Mothers by Choice has chapters all over the country.;  
It's also crucial to clarify your emotional relationship with the father, and
with men in general. Resolve any possible hidden guilt, fears, resentment,
anger and self-pity. And be prepared to face criticism from others for your
choice.;   But here's a more favorable equation: Society today values anew
family and stability. Men increasingly favor commitment and fathering. Women
are not so desperate to have a man and are building their emotional and
financial strength. Women and men have increased choices about when and how to
parent, and about fashioning alternative lifestyles.;   All that can add up to
the possibility that love -- and a new type of family -- can be even more
empowering and fulfilling.;   IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Single Mothers by Choice,
