   Surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould has asked for twice-a-week visitation with Baby M,
while the child's father wants to block all visitation, according
to court briefs.
   ``... Only a suspension of visitation will ensure that Melissa
is provided with a loving, supportive, nurturing and peaceful
environment, free from interference, at the critical stages of her
development,'' said Gary Skoloff, a lawyer for the girl's father,
William Stern.
   In legal papers released today by Superior Court Judge Birger M.
Sween, Skoloff said he will present testimony at a visitation
hearing Monday that will show the child's psychological welfare is
at stake.
   ``Indeed it is contended that the proofs will indicate that the
emotional and psychological burden which Melissa will have to
sustain in establishing a relationship with Mrs. Whitehead will be
significantly more damaging than any benefit which might occur to
her as a result of visitation at this time,'' Skoloff said in the
25-page brief.
   The visitation hearing was ordered by the state Supreme Court in
its landmark ruling Feb. 3 that restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
parental rights while awarding custody of the baby, now known as
Melissa, to Stern and his wife, Elizabeth.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has been allowed to see Melissa once a
week, for two hours, under supervision at a youth center here.
Court papers released Thursday by Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney
called that schedule ``insufficient.''
   The East Brunswick housewife, who gained notoriety by refusing
to turn over the child she agreed to bear under a $10,000 contract,
says in court papers that she wants her visits with the child to be
expanded eventually to half the summer and some holidays.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould also rejected a request by Stern to
terminate contact between mother and child for at least six years.
She contends that a break in visitation could be harmful to the
child.
   ``Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has fashioned an excellent relationship
with Melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishing
and productive relationship,'' her attorney argued.
   Legal briefs from both sides were filed with Sween earlier this
week. The judge released them today after he had time to review
them. However, Harold Cassidy, an attorney for Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould, released his brief Thursday.
   ``The warm, satisfying relationship which has come into
existence over the past two years would be lost to Melissa if
visitation were suspended,'' Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys said.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould requested that the visits be expanded
immediately to two days a week, eight hours each time, at her home
for the next six months.
   She also requested the scheduled be expanded to allow her to see
Melissa overnight every other week, alternate weekends when Melissa
is 3, and half the summer and one week of Christmas vacation when
the child is 5.
   The court papers say that when Melissa is 12 she may ``voice a
desire for more or less visitation.''
   Skoloff has said the Sterns want to delay visitations ``as long
as possible.''
