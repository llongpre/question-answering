<LEADPARA>  ON THE "Geraldo" show one afternoon last month, three women offered horrific
accounts of sexual and psychological torture inflicted upon them as young
children -- abuses they say they only recently began to recall.;   The women
spoke of monstrous acts against them almost as soon as they could walk and of
later being forced to torture others. One woman claimed to have murdered 40
children in service of a satanic cult to which her family belonged. They
claimed to have had no memory of these abuses until therapists helped unearth
them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Theirs is no longer such an unusual tale. Remarkable accounts of repressed
memories and childhood abuse are piling up. Court cases now turn on such
recollections, and support groups are cropping up for victims.;   Just over a
week ago, comedian Roseanne Arnold received massive attention with her story.
Both parents abused her, she told a group of incest victims in Denver, but the
memories stayed buried for three decades. Arnold's parents have issued a
denial and say they are considering a lawsuit.;   Last May, former Miss
America Marilyn Van Derbur Atler went public with what she said were
long-repressed memories of sexual abuse by her father.;   Carolivia Herron, a
professor at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, announced upon
publication of her latest novel, "Thereafter Johnny," that its theme of incest
and sexual torment was largely autobiographical. Writing the book triggered
long-repressed memories of almost constant abuse between the ages of 3 and 5,
Herron said, including a ghastly period as a child prostitute in a hometown
brothel. Through therapy, Herron says, she has pieced together memories of 83
separate rapes.;   Vivid as they are, are these memories accurate? Can people
really suppress events so horrible? Can they recall them in remarkable detail
so many years later?;   Increasingly, scientists are urging caution: Seemingly
long-buried memories sometimes can be pure fantasy or distortions of anything
bad that happened to a child. They can contain elements of truth, but may not
give the full picture. The harshest critics say that repressed memory has
become a fad diagnosis, used wrongly and sometimes harmfully to explain all
manner of psychological suffering.;   "This is a very soft area of science,"
said Mark J. Mills, a specialist in psychiatry and law who is often called on
to evaluate the reliability of witnesses. When frightful things happen, the
problem for most people, according to Mills, "is that they remember too well,
not that they can't.";   That memories can be repressed is generally accepted.
Scientists believe the phenomenon is one defense against trauma, though just
how the mind buries memories and why some people are more prone to lapses
remain big unknowns.;   Researchers have collected accounts of fleeting memory
loss in soldiers after battle, in accident and torture victims and in
witnesses to disaster, as well as in victims of childhood abuse.;   This sort
of amnesia is part of a broad range of psychologically linked memory problems
called "dissociative disorders." Multiple personality disorder is an extreme
form of dissociation, in which memories of traumatic experiences are thought
to be locked away in one or several separate identities, unavailable for
recall by the other personalities. In almost every multiple personality case
studied, severe and often repeated trauma in childhood was a factor.;   But
experts are troubled by a surge in newly remembered incidents that generate
ample publicity but no corroboration.;   New memories of satanic cult abuse
have reached "epidemic" proportions while independent verification is in short
supply, says Dr. George K. Ganaway, a specialist in psychiatric aberrations of
memory.;   Those claiming to have been victims are not necessarily lying.
Rather, Ganaway says, they have been persuaded -- by friend, therapist or
something they have read or have seen on television -- to adopt a plausible
explanation for their emotional pain. For highly suggestible people -- an
estimated 5 percent to 10 percent of the population -- it is a short step to
vivid, albeit fantastic, memories of things that never happened.;   Yet
flashbacks of long-ago, long-forgotten events are being used to put people on
trial. In the process, the very nature of memory is being tested in the
courtroom.;   Last January, in what many consider the first criminal case to
rest heavily on repressed memory, George T. Franklin was sentenced to life in
prison for raping and murdering 8-year-old Susan Nason in Foster City in
1969.;   The girl's body was found shortly after she was killed, but the case
went unsolved for 19 years until Franklin's daughter came forward. Eileen
Franklin-Lipsker testified persuasively to seeing her father commit the
crimes, even though she did not recall it for nearly two decades.;   A
Washington state rape case also put memory on trial, but with a twist. Paul
Ingram, a former Thurston County sheriff's deputy, was charged with repeatedly
raping two female relatives over a period of 15 years. Satanic rituals
allegedly were involved.;   Ingram pleaded guilty in 1989, but now says that
he was brainwashed by a police psychologist into believing that he had
repressed memories of the events. He says that his "recollections" of abusing
the girls came only after the psychologist put him in a hypnotic trance. A
court hearing is pending in Ingram's fight to withdraw his guilty pleas.;  
Ganaway, a clinical assistant professor at Emory University, believes that
poorly trained therapists are partly responsible for the satanic sexual-abuse
scare, and may also have led patients to believe that they were abused when
they were not. False memories can be planted through tone of voice or the
phrasing of a question.;   "I have seen families wrecked because therapists
say to a patient, 'You sound like the kind of patient who has been abused.
Tell me what your father did to you,' " said David Spiegel, a professor of
psychiatry at Stanford University and author of numerous articles on trauma
and dissociative disorders. Patients suffering from memory lapse or multiple
personality disorder have been shown to be extremely vulnerable to this type
of suggestion.;   They are "highly hypnotizable," Spiegel said. "They can
intensely fantasize about things that may or may not have happened.";  
Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis and an early investigator of
memory repression, developed his own doubts about adult memories of childhood
experiences. Freud initially believed the accounts of adult patients who said
they had been sexually abused as children. But he changed his mind in the late
1890s, writing that he could not accept such abuse as widespread. Instead, he
said that the patients' stories were fantasies, stemming from their own taboo
desires.;   For the next 60 years, psychiatrists and psychoanalysts gave short
shrift to accounts of childhood trauma, writing virtually all of it off as
fantasy, according to Lenore Terr, a noted child and adolescent psychiatrist
and author of a book on childhood psychic trauma, "Too Scared to Cry.";   Not
so today. Studies have shown sexual abuse of children and adolescents to be
far more prevalent than ever acknowledged in Freud's day. The most commonly
used estimates by behavioral scientists put the number of girls who have had
sex forced upon them by an adult as high as 1 in 3. For boys, 1 in 10.;   Terr
generally believes accounts of such trauma -- even those that have been long
repressed, provided there is psychological evidence such as depression,
phobias or other symptoms to back them up.;   "There are a few liars out there
with bad motives," she said, but hundreds more who truly have suffered.;  
Like most psychoanalytic theories, those about memory and trauma were
developed to alleviate symptoms in people suffering from depression, phobias
or other conditions. But theories cannot determine whether memories are
accurate.;   They cannot prove whether the woman on the "Geraldo" show did
indeed murder 40 children. And they cannot prove whether Arnold was truly
abused as a child. If her parents wish it, that will be for a court to decide.  </TEXT>
