   The Supreme Court today refused to hear the
appeal of a Florida woman who says she was denied custody of her
young child because she is a Jehovah's Witness.
   The justices, without comment, let stand state court rulings
that bar Rita Mendez from exposing her daughter to any of her
religious beliefs.
   The state courts also awarded primary residential custody of the
girl to her father.
   In the appeal acted on today, Mrs. Mendez said her
freedom-of-religion rights were violated by the custody
determination.
   Rita and Ignacio Mendez were divorced in Miami in 1985, after a
four-year marriage. Their daughter, Rebecca, was then 3.
   Marital difficulties arose in 1983 over Mrs. Mendez's
involvement with the Jehovah's Witnesses religion. Her husband is a
Catholic who, according to court documents, felt his wife had
``betrayed him'' by joining the Jehovah's Witnesses.
   At a custody trial, Mendez testfieid that it was not in
Rebecca's best interest to be raised as a Jehovah's Witness. Of the
485 pages in the divorce proceedings transcript devoted to child
custody, 249 pages contain references to the subject of religion.
   Two psychologists and one psychiatrist testified that Rebecca
should live with her mother, whom they called the child's ``prime
parent figure.''
   But the experts said contact with her mother's Jehovah's Witness
religion was not in Rebecca's best interest because she needs ``to
adapt herself to the mainstream of culture.''
   They testified that a Catholic upbringing ``would allow her to
adapt to society and have the freedom that Catholic children have
in the society.''
   Judge Phillip K. Knight, in awarding primary custody of Rebecca
to her father, ruled that Mrs. Mendez should enjoy ``regular,
frequent and liberal visitation, access and contact with the minor
child.''
   But he also barred Mrs. Mendez from exposing Rebecca to ``any
religious practices, attendances, teachings or events which are in
any way inconsistent with the religious teachings and practices of
the Catholic religion.''
   A state appeals court upheld the custody award, ruling that
``the record in this case does not support (Mrs. Mendez's)
contention that the trial court made the father the primary
residential parent ... solely because the mother is a practicing
Jehovah's Witness.''
   In a dissenting vote, one appeals court judge said granting the
father primary custody amounted to ``an abuse of discretion.''
   ``The child, exposed to the religious views of both parents for
two years, showed no evidence of emotional or psychological harm,''
the judge said, adding that the custody proceedings showed ``the
experts' personal biases against the mother's religion.''
   ``Their disdain for the mother's religion induced them to
speculate as to the possibility of harm to the child in the future
even though no evidence of harm existed,'' the dissenting judge
said.
   Lawyers for Mrs. Mendez told the justices, ``This court cannot
eliminate religious bigotry in America but it can and should review
this decision, which has deprived a parent of her child because of
intolerance of her faith.''
   The appeal added, ``The trial court's order places Rita in the
anomalous position of having a constitutionally protected right to
speak to total strangers about her religion but not to her own
child.''
   The case is Mendez vs. Mendez, 87-1166.
