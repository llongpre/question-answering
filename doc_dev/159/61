   The story of child abuse that Sylvia Fraser tells
in ``My Father's House'' would be chilling on any terms.
   But, even more so, the story is the writer's own.
   Fraser created a separate identity, another self, to exist when
her father sexually abused her during childhood. The other self
remained hidden and unknown to her for 40 years until she realized
she had been an abused child and summoned back the memories.
   In an interview in her nearly all-white living room, the author
said she started to write a novel about what had happened but was
``offended'' by the idea that she was putting into fiction something
that was fact. She decided to go ahead with the book despite the
self-exposure needed.
   The response has been positive, she said, including many letters
from people who tell her, ``You've written my story.''
   ``My Father's House'' was first published last year by Doubleday
Canada and, now in paperback, has been high on the Canadian
best-seller lists. It recently was published in hardcover in the
United States.
   ``Without being distracted by the `freak' element, one can relax
and enjoy Ms. Fraser's writing, which is rich yet superbly honed,''
Jill Johnston wrote in The New York Times Book Review.
   While the story has been told before in such books as ``Sybil,''
this is the first book by a professional writer about her own abuse
and multiple personality.
   Unlike Sybil, whose case has been documented by psychologists,
Fraser did not seek psychiatric help. She completely blocked out all
conscious memory of her abuse and maintained that the child victim
was a completely separate personality. Through personal awareness
and woman consciousness-raising sessions in the 1970s, she slowly
came to terms with who she was. The actual memory came spontaneously
while she was socializing one day with friends.
   Fraser was a journalist before her first novel, ``Pandora,'' was
published in 1972. She has written four novels since, all of them
including themes or incidents of sexual violence.
   ``Of course, now I understand that it was my other self,'' she
said. ``My whole writing impulse had really come from my abused
self.''
   ``My Father's House'' is a sort of detective story in which
Fraser searches for the unknown portions of her own past. Yet it
also is a remarkably vivid memoir of growing up in Hamilton, a city
about an hour's drive southwest of Toronto, in the 1940s and '50s.
   ``We were all stereotyped and terribly repressed,'' Fraser said,
proceeding with the interview despite having a ``beastly cold.''
   ``I think it was a very nasty time to grow up. It wasn't an age
of innocence, it was an age of repression.''
   Fraser believes her father's secret may have been known or
suspected among their relatives or neighbors but was simply too
horrendous to be considered in that era when even divorce was
thought of as a dirty word.
   ``The times were such that it was better not to remember,'' she
said.
   While she blocked the memories of the experiences lived by her
other self, she had nearly total recall of everything else.
   ``We're now talking about memories that are 40 years old,'' the
author said.
   Fraser attributes the crucial decisions made in her life, from
walking out on a good marriage to an affair with the father of a
childhood friend, to the confusion underlying an always outwardly
strong front.
   ``The whole emotional drive of my life was to reunite my two
selves,'' she said. ``I spent a lifetime with this mystery at my
core.''
   Fraser, who started her career as a feature writer for the
Toronto Star's weekly, said the dual personality she developed
during her childhood was an extension of the device most people use
to show different aspects at different times.
   The difference in her case, she said, was the blocking off so
that one self was not aware of the other. Perhaps in response to
puzzled looks, she said, ``It's not something to intellectualize too
much. You feel it _ or if you don't, you don't.''
   Her memory of the other self came back in December 1983.
   ``This I do know: My father was not a monster. His life was a bud
that never opened, blighted by the first frost. His crime became his
prison, his guilt his bars,'' she writes in ``My Father's House.''
   ``The force with which I came to hate my father was a measure of
the love I and my other self once bore him. I know that now.''
   Fraser said she no longer is angry.
   ``I was a very angry child and a very angry adult,'' she said.
``I'd worn that out; I'd used up all my anger. ... Basically I don't
care anymore. It really is behind me.''
   Her next book, whether a novel or non-fiction, probably will be
``fantastical, imaginative, much airier'' in contrast to her
previous works.
   ``I'm just not interested in sex and violence,'' she said.
