<LEADPARA>  'MY FATHER'S Glory," the first of two French films inspired by au-thor Marcel
Pagnol's memoirs, is just the kind of impossibly romantic and sunny tale
Pagnol himself might have penned.;   Consider that a backhanded compliment.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Pagnol, best known for "The Marseilles Trilogy" and the recently adapted
"Jean de Florette" and "Manon of the Spring," isn't everyone's bowl of cafe au
lait. His prose tends to the overripe and melodramatic; his subtle ironies
sneak up on you like freight trains in the night.;   No, subtlety was never
Pagnol's strong suit. The actor-novelist-film maker, who died in 1974, was
more at home exalting his beloved dockside scoundrels Marius and Cesar and the
sun-dappled Provincal countryside. In the first two volumes of "Memories of
Childhood," Pagnol's teacher father got the larger-than-life treatment. "My
Father's Glory" (opening today) recounts young Marcel's adventures from
infancy, when he astounded all by teaching himself to read, to age 11, when he
discovered cicadas, the Garlaban ("a towering mass of blue rock") and, on a
comic hunting trip, a more "human" side of the father he idolized.;   As
played by Philippe Caubere, Joseph Pagnol recalls both the young Alan Arkin
and the perpetually discombobulated Monsieur Hulot. We can well understand why
Marcel (first Benoit Martin, then Julien Ciamaca) hangs on his every word, his
every flamboyant pronouncement. Joseph Pagnol, as portrayed, is the kind of
father every boy longs for -- part god figure, part incorrigible playmate.;  
As for young Marcel's mother, Augustine (Nathalie Roussel), there's an
alliance here, a gentle conspiracy, that in another context would bring a
smile to a Freudian psychologist. Marcel viewed his mother as confidante and
best friend, always referring to her by her given name. "She was always the
same age as I and that has never changed," he tells us.;   "My Father's
Glory," in French with English subtitles, opens at the turn of the century. In
the eyes of Pagnol -- and now director Yves Robert -- it was a time of
unbounded optimism and steam-belching contraptions that would change the
world. To the delight of his father -- and concern of his mother and Aunt Rose
(Therese Liotard), the 3-year-old Marcel learns to read by osmosis. "His brain
will burst!" worries Aunt Rose. "Let him be a child a little longer," agrees
Mother.;   Of course this is not to be. Marcel is a chip off the ol' block, a
born trailblazer and poet. He observes and celebrates nature. His first
letdown comes when he discovers that grown-ups, for the sake of convenience,
like to stretch and embroider the truth. They also suffer from overweening
pride.;   In contrast to most coming-of-age idylls in which the young hero
learns the truth and loses respect for his elders, "My Father's Glory" has
young Marcel accepting his father's foibles and thereby learning new respect
for the old man.;   As directed by popular farceur Robert ("Pardon Mon
Affaire"), this period piece always seems about to break into song, like a
Gallic "Sound of Music." There's a robust, over-the-top quality to everyone
who passes before Robert's camera. Sometimes this results in charming,
Truffaut-like vignettes, such as when Aunt Rose dances in the rain with a
chubby suitor named Jules (Diddier Pain). Elsewhere, Robert's breathless
approach may leave you nauseous, like too many bonbons. It's here that
Pagnol's "little song of filial piety" becomes bloated beyond all
recognition.;   Certainly the best scenes take place at the holiday villa in
Provence. Here the majestic scenery and awesome thunderstorms make Pagnol's
florid prose seem like so much understatement. During this sojourn in the
wilds, "My Father's Glory" feels like one of Disney's better castaway
adventures. Young Marcel's book of choice during this "great adventure"? Why,
"Robinson Crusoe," of course.;   "My Mother's Castle," which further explores
Pagnol's relationship with co-conspirator Augustine, will arrive in the South
Bay in late October.;   My Father's Glory; (star)(star) 1/2; Rated: G (solid
family fare); Cast: Philippe Caubere, Nathalie Roussel, Julien Ciamaca;
Director: Yves Robert; Screenwriter: Lucette Andrei; Running time: 1 hour, 50
