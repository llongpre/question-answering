   A jury today acquitted a man of sexually
molesting his 5{-year-old daughter in a case that drew national
attention when the girl's mother went to jail rather than let her
husband see the child.
   After about three hours of deliberation, a Superior Court jury
found 33-year-old Mark Russell Murabito of Derry not guilty.
Supporters in the back of the courtroom cheered.
   His former wife, Jesse Murabito, 40, was led from the courtroom
by supporters with her head down.
   Defense attorney Eugene McCann disputed the testimony of a child
psychiatrist and a pediatrician, arguing the child was influenced by
her mother and learned through repeated interrogations by her to
describe the alleged abuse.
   ``Do you think she learned the story?'' he asked during closing
arguments. ``Do you think she got a feel for what it is that mommy
is looking for?''
   He said the girl had been psychologically abused by her mother,
her father and the system, but not sexually abused by her father.
``She has been bounced off everyone you can think of as it relates
to psychological abuse,'' he said.
   County Attorney Carleton Eldredge argued that the girl had
engaged in adult sexual behavior unusual and inappropriate for
children her age, and that it must have been shown to her.
   ``The girl was her own best spokesperson when she said that daddy
touched her,'' he said.
   Eldredge also disputed defense contention that Mrs. Murabito's
behavior marked her as an obsessive paranoid. ``What is the standard
of a mother who thinks her child has been sexually abused?'' he
asked. ``Frantic probably doesn't describe it.''
   ``Jesse Murabito was motivated solely to defend her child and she
did it every way she knew how,'' he said. ``Within that context,
Jesse Murabito makes more sense than anybody we've heard from.''
   Dr. Muriel Sugarman, a child psychiatrist, and Dr. Charles
Shubin, a pediatrician who specializes in examining alleged sexually
abused children, had testified for the prosecution, supporting the
allegations of sexual abuse.
