<TEXT>     Arnold said she only recently recalled being sexually abused as a child.
She first made the accusations at a gathering of the Survivors United Network,
a group of adult incest survivors. The star of ABC's "Roseanne" said a lot of
abuse she suffered from her mother was physical and psychological. As for her
father, she said: "My father molested me until I left home at age 17. He
constantly put his hands all over me.";   Barr said he had no idea why his
daughter would make such charges and added, "We're crushed."  </TEXT>
