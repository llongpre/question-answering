Sexton's most recent novel is "Private Acts"; her second novel, "Mirror
Images," dealt with incest. In cooperating with Diane Middlebrook on a
forthcoming biography of poet Anne Sexton, she speaks about her own sexual
abuse as a child by her mother.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  By Betsy Petersen; Bantam Books, 192 pp., $19;  THERE are some experiences so
ugly and damaging that the mind represses them, erasing their memory from
consciousness while their impact remains forever imprinted on the soul. These
experiences survive unarticulated, buried in the recesses of the mind,
emitting noxious gases that poison a life silently and secretly.;   
Sometimes, however, a person is courageous and determined enough to dig for
the source of the contamination. Betsy Petersen is such a woman, and "Dancing
With Daddy" is the moving story of her exploration into the ruins of her
childhood.;    Written almost like a journal, complete with dreams,
nightmares, fantasies and meditations, "Dancing With Daddy" tackles one of the
most disturbing, taboo subjects in our society: incest -- in this case, a
father's sexual abuse of his two daughters. Recently, increasing national
attention has been directed toward identifying incest survivors and helping
them recover from the trauma, and there has been discussion within the
American Psychiatric Association about broadening the diagnosis of
post-traumatic stress disorder to include incest victims.;    Deceptive
appearances;  "Dancing With Daddy" is a personal narrative of one child's
experience with sexual abuse and should convince even the most skeptical that
such a travesty can and does occur, far more frequently than most of us would
like to admit, in homes that appear normal.;    Betsy Petersen was 3 years old
when her father, a returning World War II veteran and surgeon suffering from
depression over his temporary unemployment, began entering her room during her
afternoon nap. As he masturbated himself against the bars of her crib, he also
put his "surgeon's hands" into her underpants and masturbated her. His abusive
behavior continued until she was 18, moving from mutual masturbation to oral
sex to sexual intercourse, but Petersen would not remember it until she
entered psychotherapy at age 45, when all those years of "eating the pain"
began to have inevitable repercussions on her roles as a wife and mother.;   
In his public life, Clinton Ervin was a respected, well-liked surgeon with a
lucrative practice in Hillsborough. At the time of his death, the church
overflowed with mourners, and Betsy and her mother received innumerable
condolence letters, some of which are included in the book. They are
unnecessary, for Petersen's narrative has demonstrated the gulf between her
father's inner and outer lives. Her portrait gives the reader a man complete
with strengths and weaknesses; this tragedy occurred in what looked to be an
ordinary home. In fact, the book's most profound and frightening aspect is
that monsters such as Clint Ervin move among us all the time, but we cannot
see them -- or choose not to see them -- because they look remarkably like
ourselves.;    Her mother's alcoholism, collusive silence and evasion of the
truth about what was happening to her daughters are also confronted. Like many
incest survivors, Petersen feels equally enraged with her mother for closing
her eyes and not protecting her daughter in the manner every child has the
right to expect.;    Although she has confronted her mother with her memories
and expressed her anger, there appears to be a lack of resolution between
them. At the time of publication, her mother -- whose name does not appear in
the book -- had chosen not to read the book or ask about its contents.
However, her mother, now a psychiatric social worker with a master's degree
from the University of California, Berkeley, did not oppose her daughter's
decision to publish her story or to use her own name.;    Petersen's sister,
Pat, 11 years older, was the only daughter from her mother's first marriage.
Ervin abused his stepdaughter in the bedroom the two girls shared, penetrating
her after he had finished fondling Betsy, particularly on those evenings when
he and his wife had quarreled. Petersen recovered her memories of the
incestuous episodes too late to share them with her sister, who was killed in
an automobile accident with her second husband when she was 33 and Betsy 22.
Although they were never able to validate each other's rage by discussing
their father's betrayal, Petersen feels that her memory of her sister's abuse
was integral to the process of coming to terms with her own. "She was my ally.
She was the only one in the world who knew what life with my parents was
like.";    The next generation;  As an adult, Petersen had great difficulty
raising her own children, finding that their needs threw her into a panic
because they were subconscious reminders of those demands she had found so
terrifying as a child. She went into therapy as much to help and protect her
two sons as to help herself, and when her memory reasserted itself to unload
its overdue shipment of pain, she kept the image of her children directly in
front of her as incentive to continue.;     Because keeping the secret was so
integral a part of the abuse, Petersen, now a writer in Metairie, La., wanted
to make it public as a way to deny her father the silence he had so long
required. This book may be only a symbolic gesture now -- but it is one aimed
toward crucial emotional healing. Clint Ervin wanted his daughter to be a
writer, and she now has written her first book: What justice that she has at
last told the truth about events he told her over and over never took place.; 
  "Dancing With Daddy" is uneven in places, perhaps because this is Petersen's
first book and its subject matter is so agonizing. The intensity with which
she writes is admirable, though, and of particular beauty are the dream
sequences that chart the process by which she discovered exactly what was done
to her and how she felt about it.;     The most evocative and powerful
sections of the book are those in which Petersen describes how a child
experiences overwhelming sexual sensations: the pleasure, the terror, the
pain, the fantasy of damage to one's self, one's body and even one's parent.
She details her deep confusion and shame over what her father coerced her to
do -- and to keep secret -- in the name of love.;     "Dancing With Daddy" is
a chronicle of rage and grief and love; at its conclusion, Petersen accepts
the loss of her childhood to her parents' narcissism and learns to take
responsibility for, and to love, the child who remains within her. In
confronting her past, she creates a new life for herself and offers her
children her greatest gift -- the kind of childhood she was never allowed to
have. Bravo.  </TEXT>
