   More than 1 million divorced and widowed
fathers are on the ``daddy track,'' learning to balance children,
housework, social life and career as a single parent.
   Their numbers are growing and are expected to continue rising as
more fathers seek custody and courts become more inclined to go
along.
   Like single mothers, these men are discovering there are
pitfalls in raising kids alone. But their problems often are
different.
   Single fathers usually are better off financially than single
mothers. On the other hand, people tend to treat men differently
than their female counterparts.
   From the sales clerk to the next-door neighbor, people often
react by heaping assistance on these single-parent fathers,
offering help with child care, cooking, cleaning and shopping, says
Geoffrey L. Greif, an associate professor at the University of
Maryland's Baltimore School of Social Work.
   The result, Greif says, is that many of these fathers get
conflicting messages.
   ``They are praised for what they are doing ... but on the other
hand they are offered a helping hand,'' he said in an interview
last week. ``People think they are incompetent to do it by
themselves. It's a funny position that these men are put in, being
praised and insulted.''
   Psychologically, the adjustments are different also.
   ``When men gain custody, they often feel like freaks, like there
aren't any other people out there doing it,'' Greif said.
   Greif, who profiles single fathers in a new book, said a father
once asked him ``How many other freaks are there like me?''
   ``The impression is that they are doing something that is
strange, and some men interpret that to mean they are doing
something that isn't masculine, and that takes a toll that's harder
to measure and harder to see.
   ``It tends to isolate some of the fathers ... (and) in a society
that believes women should be the ones raising children, it has the
potential for hindering the self-esteem of the children,'' he said.
   Using a survey of more than 1,100 single fathers with custody
and interviews with dozens of others, Greif crafted a profile of
these men for his book, ``The Daddy Track and the Single Parent.''
   The book debunks many of the myths of single fathering,
including popular notions of men foundering in the kitchen and
chaotically coping with the daily chores.
   In fact, one of the biggest trouble areas for single fathers,
like single mothers, is balancing work and child rearing.
   Greif said some of the fathers he interviewed had to quit their
jobs and some were fired, but most often the problem was a
frustrating halt to their rise up the career ladder.
   ``Men in our society define themselves as males based in large
part on their success at work, so when you place a man on this
track ... he sometimes has to make a choice between pursuing his
career path or putting his career on hold,'' Greif said.
   Single-parenting often limits an employee's ability to travel on
short notice, which can hinder their chances for promotion. ``Some
men feel they are being passed over,'' he said.
   Housekeeping and child care are easier problems to overcome,
Greif found. After the first few months on their own, most men had
these areas under control, and generally their relationships with
their children were positive, he said.
   In 1988, about 1.2 million divorced and widowed fathers were
raising their children, compared with 8.1 million single-parent
mothers, according to the Census Bureau.
   But the ranks of these fathers are growing _ by more than 50
percent compared with 16 percent for single-parent mothers in the
first seven years of the 1980s, Greif said.
   The jury is still out on whether children fare better with their
mother or father, ``but generally the outcome seems to be the
same,'' he said.
   Greif concludes that in general men find single-parenting much
more difficult than they thought it would be, ``but very few say
they regret the choice.''
