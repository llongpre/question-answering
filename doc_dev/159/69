   A lawyer for the Boy Scouts of America said
Tuesday that psychological problems plaguing a boy who was sexually
molested by his scoutmaster stem from his unstable family life.
   The family of the youth, who is now 17, is suing the scouts and
former scoutmaster Carlton L. Bittenbender, saying the boy suffers
from a stress disorder because of Bittenbender's assaults and that
the scouts' system for detecting child abusers is inadequate and
ineffective.
   But attorney Robert E. Cadigan told a Fairfax County, Va.,
Circuit Court jury in his opening arguments that the teen, whose
name is not being publicly revealed, required psychiatric treatment
as early as the third grade, long before he met Bittenbender at age
12.
   ``The fact is, this youth had many problems even before
Bittenbender came on the scene,'' said Cadigan.
   The boy willingly submitted to a sexual relationship with his
scoutmaster for 10 or 11 months, Cadigan told the jury of three men
and six women. ``Evidence will show that at no time when this
relationship was going on did (the youth) have emotional problems.''
   Instead, Cadigan charged, the boy had to go to a psychiatric
hospital two months after the relationship with Bittenbender ended
in Dec. 1985 because he was acting out his anger over long-term
family problems.
   ``When Bittenbender's name was brought up (during the youth's
hospitalization),'' said Cadigan, ``it caused no adverse emotional
response from (the boy). On the contrary, he idolized Bittenbender.
   ``It was his parents' visits that caused an adverse emotional
response,'' he said.
   The youth's mother had a sexual relationship with Bittenbender
for about four months during the period when the scoutmaster was
molesting the boy, Cadigan said.
   The boy's father was a homosexual, had a drinking problem, and
moved out of the family's home late last year, Cadigan said. He also
said a psychologist had diagnosed the father as being a ``possible
manic depressive.''
   The family's attorney, William A. Barton, said Monday that
Bittenbender was able to evade detection because the organization,
fearing negative publicity, was reluctant to publicize abuse cases
and identify abusers. He also said there were no internal safeguards
against potential child molesters within the scouts.
   On Monday, Barton had also discussed the problems troubling the
boy's parents.
   Barry Bach, another attorney for the scouts, said the
organization kept confidential files to screen out people who were
unfit to lead scout troops.
   Bittenbender is serving a 30-year prison term for his 1985
conviction for sodomy and aggravated sexual battery against three
boys under the age of 13, including the youth represented in the
lawsuit. He had had a prior history of molesting boys that resulted
in dismissals from New England public schools and convictions on
four counts of second-degree sexual assault as scoutmaster of a
Rhode Island troop in 1981.
   The boy's family is seeking about $100,000 for his health care
costs plus punitive damages.
