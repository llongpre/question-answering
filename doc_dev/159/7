<LEADPARA>  WHEN television producers Danny Jacobson and Norma Safford Vela were casting
their ABC situation comedy "Davis Rules" -- starring Jonathan Winters and
Randy Quaid as father and son raising Quaid's three boys -- they couldn't find
the right actress to play Quaid's wife. So, they killed her off before the
show began.;    Jacobson recalls that as they wrestled with that decision,
Vela balked, asking: "Is this going to be another dead-mom show?"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mothers, in case you hadn't noticed, are biting the dust in prime-time
comedies.;    Lately, there has been a weird sort of post-feminist backlash in
television's depiction of the American family, and the message is hardly
subliminal: If Mom's not going to stick around in the kitchen, then -- poof --
let's dump her.;    Sometimes, she has up and walked out (as in "Blossom," to
pursue a singing career, or as in "Wings," to serve time in prison for
embezzlement). Usually, though, she's dead, the victim of a car crash.;   
And, riotously or not, a hapless Dad, a la "Mr. Mom," is left to fend for
himself and the kids, often with the help of a male in-law.;    In ABC's
sleeper "Full House," a father, his boyish-looking brother-in-law and his pal,
who does a lot of Popeye imitations, do their heartwarming best to look after
three girls.;    "The Family Man" on CBS stars Gregory Harrison as a
firefighter who, with his father-in-law, raises four children.;    The Judith
Ivey series, "Down Home," and "Empty Nest," both on NBC, feature widowed
fathers dealing with their grown children.;    The Fox network has a new
father-son show called "Top of the Heap," a spinoff of "Married . . . With
Children" that stars Joe Bologna.;    Motherless families have long been a
staple of American television.;    Think back to the Ponderosa days of Pa and
Hoss on "Bonanza." Then there were "My Three Sons," "Bachelor Father," "The
Courtship of Eddie's Father" and "Family Affair.";    Then, for a while, TV
moved closer to mirroring reality with fatherless series, most notably "One
Day at a Time" and "Kate and Allie.";    So why the resurgence now? Why are so
many television mothers missing? Is TV reflecting the culture, or offering a
fantasy? Could Marge Simpson be the next to go?;    "I shudder to think what
would happen if Marge weren't there to keep Homer from killing the kids," says
Matt Groening, creator of "The Simpsons," who has as keen an eye as anyone in
television for how dysfunctional families work.;    "In our culture, fathers
have schemed their way out of familial duties. These sitcoms without mothers
finally force them to do the parental thing.";    In truth, of course, most
American children are still being cared for by their mothers, not their
fathers, even though the majority of mothers work outside the home.;    But
the current rash of shows without mothers can be traced to a confluence of
psychological, sociological and economic factors, including the exploitation
of every working mother's most basic guilt about deserting her children and
the flip side of that -- a child's fear of abandonment caused by women's
changing roles in society.;    Television, says child psychologist Judith
Wallerstein, is simply ahead of the social sciences in reflecting an emotional
truth, if not reality.;    Wallerstein, who is co-author, with Sandra
Blakeslee, of "Second Chances: Men, Women and Children a Decade After
Divorce," explains that a rising interest in father-child relationships has
been sparked by the fact that the mother's role has changed because of both
divorce and work.;    "The issue of mother as she used to be is vanishing,"
Wallerstein continues.;    "The children I see of divorces complain of this
all the time: 'There's nobody home. I come home to an empty house.' These
children are full of compassion about how hard Mom is working, so their anger
is inhibited by the compassion. But the sense of the mother not being there
accurately reflects the psychological experience and the longing and the
anger.";    Wallerstein points to recent data showing that about 90 percent of
children from divorced households live with their mothers, many of whom are
beset by financial problems.;    But depending on custody arrangements, more
fathers are spending time alone with their children, and in two-career
marriages, fathers by necessity tend to be more involved parents.;    "What
these TV programs seem to be giving us," she says, "is a sense of the
vanishing mother," both symbolically and in reality.  </TEXT>
