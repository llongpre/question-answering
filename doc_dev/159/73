<HEAD>Excerpts From Court Ruling In Baby M Visitation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Surrogate Mom, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of the ruling by Superior
Court Judge Birger M. Sween, who granted unsupervised visitation to
surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould on Wednesday was immediately granted one
six-hour day of visitation with the 2-year-old child, Melissa
Stern, with the schedule expanded over the next year to include
overnights, holidays and a two-week vacation in the summer of 1989.

<HEAD>MELISSA'S BEST INTERESTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The court finds that Melissa's best interests will be served by
unsupervised, uninterrupted, liberal visitation with her mother.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   She and her mother have the right to develop their own special
relationship.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MARY BETH WHITEHEAD-GOULD</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould had custody of Melissa and nurtured
her for four months after her birth. Thereafter, she has seen
Melissa on a regular, periodic basis until the present time. They
have a warm and loving relationship, interact well and
appropriately, and stay engaged with each other over two-hour
periods under restrictive and confining circumstances.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The court finds no credible evidence or expert opinion that
Melissa will suffer any psychological or emotional harm by
continued and expanded visitation with her mother.
   William and Elizabeth Stern offered no evidence to support their
fears that Melissa's continued relationship with her mother will
somehow adversely affect her development or jeopardize their
parent-child relationship.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WILLIAM AND ELIZABETH STERN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   William and Elizabeth Stern are extraordinarily good parents who
are devoting themselves to the nurturing and development of their
daughter and their daughter is firmly bonded to them.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   (The Sterns) will be her parental role models and provide the
day-to-day, parent-child interaction which will largely determine
what kind of person Melissa will become. They will make the
parental decisions concerning her religion, education, and moral
standards.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   William and Elizabeth Stern must accept and understand that
Melissa will develop a different and speciial relationship with her
mother, stepfather, siblings and extended family and that these
relationships need not diminsh their parent-child relationship with
Melissa.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MELISSA STERN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Melissa is a resilient child who is no less capable than
thousands of children of broken marriages who successfully adjust
to complex family relationships when their parents remarry.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Melissa has no problems separating from her father and
stepmother when brought to visitation, no separation anxiety during
the two hours she is left with her mother, and no adverse reactions
to visitation after she has returned to her father and stepmother.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STRIFE BETWEEN STERNS AND MRS. WHITEHEAD-GOULD</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Melissa's adustment and the quality of her relationships with
her parents and stepparents will depend largely on how well they
accept and adjust their respective roles.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The court does not underestimate the great difficulty the
parties will have in accepting the others' role in Melissa's life.
Family dreams have been shattered, insults and false accusations
have been exchanged, and lies and deceptions made in the heat of
litigation. However, family tragedies in our society are not
uncommon and parents often are called upon to make sacrifices
arising from unforeseen circumstances. In the context of family
problems frequently seen by Family Court judges, the causes of the
parties' estrangement do not appear insurmountable.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The parties do not have the emotional scars of a failure of an
intimate relationship intertwined with that of their child. They
have never been emotionally involved and should be able to make
rational decisions in their mutual best interests and the best
interest of Melissa.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PUBLICITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The parties have represented that they have no intention of
selling any ``movie rights'' they may have concerning ``Baby M'' as
the sale of such rights may permit the parites, Melissa, or their
activies to be fictionally portrayed. Therefore, the court will
restrain and enjoin the parties from the sale of any such rights
they may have without prior approval of the court.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The court will not infringe on the parties' right to communicate
publicly on the issue of surrogate parenting and their personal
experiences so long as they do not affect Melissa's right to
privacy.
