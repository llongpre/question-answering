<LEADPARA>  The third-grader shuffled into class at the El Toro Marine School and,
exhausted, asked his teacher if he could lay his head on his desk.;    His
father, a Marine in Saudi Arabia, had called the night before, and his mother
had cried much of the night. The boy had stayed up late holding and comforting
her until she fell asleep.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "This, to me, was such a symbol of what so many kids are going through,"
said the teacher, Nan Pelayo. "My God, this is a 9-year-old boy, and he's
staying up until the middle of the night helping his mother deal with this
thing.";    The children of military personnel are accustomed to having a
parent gone, but the stress of Operation Desert Shield -- with the sudden
deployment, prospect of heavy casualties and uncertain date of return -- has
taken a psychological toll.;    Some children are withdrawn and depressed at
school; others crave attention and become behavior problems. Young children
sometimes burst into tears when the Persian Gulf crisis comes up in class or
on TV.;    "Because of the potential danger, a lot of parents at home are more
worried and depressed, and that's passed along to the kids," said Steven
Sparta, chief psychologist at Children's Hospital in San Diego. "So these
children have to deal with a double punch -- the loss of one parent, with the
remaining parent less available to deal with their needs.";    Southern
California schools near military bases are trying to help. Teachers are
including more information on the Middle East in their classes to dispel
rumors and reduce confusion. School districts are training teachers to
identify and assist children troubled by a parent's absence. Group counseling
sessions for children are common. And some school districts have contingency
plans for counseling those whose parents are killed in combat.;    The array
of programs is unprecedented, school officials say, and a sharp contrast to
what was offered during the Vietnam War. Many teachers avoided the subject of
war and made no special efforts on behalf of students whose parents were
overseas.;    "We're much more aware of the emotional needs of children
today," said Joan Burnside, assistant superintendent at the Morongo Unified
School District, which includes schools near the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps
Base. "When you're dealing with a group of kids who every night are reminded
on TV that their dads might be blown up . . . well, you don't just ignore this
and try to teach them to read. If they're going to learn anything, you're
going to have to deal with some of their anxieties first.";    Phyllis Chutuk,
a child development teacher at Oceanside High School, said one of her best
students has been ignoring homework assignments recently and has been
distracted in class.;    "Lately I haven't been up to par in any of my
classes," the student wrote in a note to her. "See, since my dad left for
Saudi, my life has been a big, huge mess. You figure I'd be used it by now,
but you don't really get used to it.;    "It's been real hard on my mother . .
. and all these military wives keep my mother stressed and upset by calling
her, crying. She doesn't need that, seeing how she's sad too. I'm not trying
to blame people or make excuses. I just feel real bad about my performance and
I plan to improve. Please forgive me.";    On a recent Monday morning at the
Operation Desert Shield Counseling Group, a 16-year-old girl tells other
Oceanside High School students that she feels "all alone." Her father, a
Marine, has been in Saudi Arabia since August. Her mother, a member of the
Army Reserves, was called up over the weekend.;    "I have nobody left.
Everybody I care about is over there," the girl says. "I worry all the time
now that something is going to happen to them." She begins to cry.;    The
school psychologist hands her a tissue. He asks who is taking care of her. She
is staying with her aunt, but they do not get along. She has few friends
because her family moved to Oceanside only a few months ago.;    "It sounds
stupid," the girl said, "but yesterday I took down all the pictures of my
parents from the walls. I thought it wouldn't hurt so much if I didn't think
about them all the time. It just doesn't seem fair that the president took
both my parents. Why couldn't he have left just one?";    The psychologist
counsels her for a few minutes. Then other students begin to talk about
themselves and their families.;    "My dad called last night, said hello, and
before he could say anything else, my mom broke down.";    "I hear they just
sent 2,000 body bags over there. That's scary.";    "My dad left a few days
ago and it was real hard for him. He walked up to the ship and never even
turned around and looked back.";    "A friend of the family was over the other
night and he said it's not going to get better over there, it's only going to
get worse. My sister started crying, and the whole family got depressed.";   
School psychologist Gene Ramos has been participating in these weekly
sessions, along with two counselors, since the beginning of the school year.
As the deployment drags on and tension at home mounts, he said, students are
increasingly anxious about their parents' safety.;    Elementary-school
children often ask if their parents are going to die in the Middle East.;   
"You can't reassure them that dad will make it home safely and that nothing
will happen to him. That's unrealistic," said Charles Hogan, a psychologist at
Hancock Elementary School in San Diego, next to a Navy housing complex. "If
something does happen, then you'll lose your credibility. The best thing we
can do is let them express their concerns. And we can explain that this is all
part of their dad's job, he has been well trained and they need to trust in
the fact that he'll do his job well."  </TEXT>
