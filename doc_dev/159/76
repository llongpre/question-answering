   A woman with cerebral palsy who had two
sons taken away by county officials is ending the custody fight her
lawyer says ``galvanized the cause of disabled parents' rights
across the nation.''
   Tiffany Callo, 21, says she has agreed to a settlement that
would allow her 18-month and 8-month-old boys to be raised together
by foster parents and let her visit them every six months.
   ``In this case, it just boiled down to an individual mother's
decision that, at this point in time, it was in her children's best
interest and her best interest to let the open adoption go
through,'' Callo's attorney, Clay Bedford, said Monday.
   Bedford said the custody proceedings Callo had faced were
unconstitutional, an ``all or nothing'' gamble that encourages
parents like Callo to settle for limited visitation. Had Callo
lost, he said, the children likely would have been placed in a
``closed adoption,'' with visitation forever lost.
   ``She would have never been able to see the kids again or hear
from the kids again. It would have been just as if she had died or
the kids had died,'' Bedford said.
   Despite the decision to end the custody battle, Bedford said the
case won support from many other disabled parents.
   ``I think Tiffany has galvanized the cause of disabled parents'
rights across the nation,'' he said. ``There's going to be other
cases because there's a lot of disabled parents out there.''
   After stories about Callo's case appeared in newspapers around
the country last year and earlier this year, she received dozens of
letters in support of her fight and offers to help her raise her
children.
   Callo, who needs a wheelchair to get around, said she has
developed a warm relationship with the foster parents who plan to
adopt the boys.
   ``I feel good about them,'' Callo said of the parents. ``The
lady is taking very good care of my boys.''
   Callo and the boys' father, Tony Rios, who also uses a
wheelchair, married in November but separated soon afterward,
Bedford said. She is now seeking a divorce. Rios did not return
messages seeking comment on the custody arrangement.
   Callo's first son, David, was removed from her home by social
workers last year. Her second son, Jessie, was removed the day
after he was born in January. Neither boy is disabled.
   Callo said Santa Clara County officials initially told her she
was incapable of caring for her children because of her disability.
Later, officials cited other reasons, including her psychological
evaluation, Callo said.
