   The more time that children _ especially boys
_ spend in one-parent homes, the less schooling they are likely to
complete, university researchers say.
   And time spent with a single parent during the formative,
pre-school years seems to have a particularly negative impact on a
boy's future education, according to Sheila Fitzgerald Krein and
Andrea H. Beller of the School of Human Resources and Family
Studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana.
   Single, working mothers appear to provide greater incentive, as
a role model, for their daughters than their sons, Beller said in a
telephone interview Monday. She said that while the role-model
influence, in the case of girls, appears to compensate for the
mother's loss of time at home, ``the boy doesn't have this model,
he just has the loss of a parent.''
   With the nation's increasing divorce rate, about 60 percent of
all children are now estimated to spend at least some of their
childhood in a single-parent situation, Krein and Beller reported.
   ``This trend has aroused social concern in part because these
families typically have fewer resources, in particular time and
money, than two-parent families,'' they reported in Demography, the
journal of the Population Association of America.
   ``Educational advancement is one route out of poverty, but the
children in these families get significantly less of it. Thus, this
lower level of education will have long-term consequences for the
economic well-being of the future family of this young adult,'' the
report states.
   While many studies have focused on the psychological
consequences for children in one-parent families, few have looked
at the long-term economics, the report went on.
   The two Illinois researchers said they studied effects on
education because it ``has been shown to be a predictor of welfare
recipiency and persistent poverty'' and ``lack of education is one
determinent of chronic unemployment.''
   Beller and Krein used a pair of long-term surveys to study two
generations of mothers and their offspring, totaling 2,500 boys and
girls.
   ``In general, the longer time spent in a single-parent family,
the greater the reduction in educational attainment,'' they found.
   The largest impact was among white males, they reported, with
each year spent in a one-parent family reducing eventual education
by about one-tenth of a year.
   ``White men who spent an average number of years (5.1) in a
single-parent family completed 0.5 fewer years of schooling than
those who spent none; white men who spent all 18 years in a
single-parent family completed 1.7 fewer years of schooling,'' they
found.
   Black males, on average, spent 8 years in a one-parent
situation, and received 0.6 year less schooling than those who
spent their entire childhood in a two-parent home. Black males
spending 18 years with just one parent finished 1.3 fewer years of
school.
   The impact was much less significant for women. Indeed, for
white women time spent in a single-parent family had no impact on
eventual education. The impact was slight for black women.
   ``This suggests room for a powerful role-model effect of the
working mother,'' reported Krein and Beller.
   A follow-up study, not yet published, found that the effect of
the missing parent is reduced, although not eliminated, in cases
where the father pays child support, Beller added.
   In these cases, though the father may not be present, he still
serves as a good role model and ``that affects educational
attainment in a positive direction.''
   The greatest impact on eventual education was among youngsters
whose pre-school years were spent in one-parent families, the study
said. It suggested that ``Since the pre-school years matter most,
affordable day-care with an educational component could replace
some of the functions of the absent parent.''
   Living in a family with brothers and sisters _ thus reducing the
time available for the parent to concentrate on any one child _
also reduced eventual educational attainment, Beller and Krein
found. Again, the effect was most pronounced among boys.
   Factors the researchers found to boost educational attainment
were higher family income, amount of reading materials in the home
and the mother's education. The father's education appeared to be a
factor among whites, but not blacks, they added.
