   Carla Southwell recalls vividly the 53
days ``of sheer hell'' she spent in a jail cell for refusing to
disclose the whereabouts of her two daughters, who she says were
sexually abused by her former husband.
   Nine months later _ with her contempt-of-court case under appeal
_ she's back with her children but worried the reunion may be
temporary.
   A judge is expected to rule by year's end whether Ms. Southwell
or her former husband, William Southwell, should be granted
permanent custody of the girls, ages 5 and 6.
   Ms. Southwell acknowledges that her earlier defiance may work
against her.
   ``I can't even imagine my kids living with him. It would destroy
these girls,'' she said recently, sitting in her mobile home behind
her parents' rural home. ``As it is, I don't know that they'll ever
fully recover.''
   Ms. Southwell, 27, speaks in a whisper at times as the girls
fight over a Barbie doll a few feet away. Tears well as she talks
about the girls' depression and the distant look they sometimes
have.
   The younger girl repeatedly sweeps her hand over her genital
area, a nervous response Ms. Southwell attributes to the alleged
molestations. Her sister, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, wears
diapers to bed since she began bed-wetting two years ago, after the
alleged abuse began.
   The girls recently have begun seeing a counselor ``because they
seem to need to talk about it, and I don't know how to handle it,''
said Ms. Southwell, who also has a 17-month-old son by her fiance.
They plan to marry when the custody battle ends.
   Women have been jailed in several cities recently for contempt
of court, choosing to serve time rather than submt their children
to what they believe i{ a sentence of abuse.
   In the best-known case, Elizabeth Morgan, a plastic surgeon, has
been jailed since August 1987 in the District of Columbia for
hiding her daughter from court-ordered visits with her father.
Congress is considering legislation that would set a cap on such
jailings.
   In the Southwell case, the girls indicated in a videotape for a
custody hearing last year they had been molested, and a doctor
testified that at least one of the girls had injuries typical of
child abuse.
   An investigation of Southwell, 30, and his younger brother
turned up no evidence of abuse, said Sgt. Ken Kleinheksel of the
Kent County Sheriff's Department.
   ``This is one of the toughest cases I've seen and I feel sorry
for both sides,'' Kleinheksel said. ``But as far as I'm concerned,
the case is closed.''
   Southwell contends the girls were coached by their mother to
make the allegations.
   ``I would kill myself before I would sexually abuse those
children,'' Southwell said Wednesday. ``As far as I'm concerned,
that's about the worst thing a person can do.''
   He said he has a strong relationship with the girls and is
confident he'll win custody. ``They know their dad never hurt them
and that I love them; that's one thing Carla can't take away. When
they're here, they ask if they can stay.''
   Carla Southwell was pregnant when the couple married in 1983.
Less than two years later, they were separated, and they divorced
in 1986. She contends Southwell physically abused her during their
marriage and that ``he didn't even know these kids existed. He was
never around.''
   She said her daughters told her in 1987 their uncle had sexually
abused them on a visit to their father's. Later the allegations
included her former husband, she said.
   She began canceling visits and Southwell went to court seeking
permanent custody. Her request for supervised visitations was
denied, and a family services counselor told the court that unless
Southwell was granted custody he likely would never see the girls.
   Upon learning that custody might go to her former husband, Ms.
Southwell fled with the girls, found them a place to stay and
returned to face court proceedings.
   ``I knew I had to protect my daughters, but I never felt that I
should run away with them for good because I hadn't done anything
wrong,'' she said. ``All I wanted was supervised visitation and him
to get treatment.''
   Kent County Circuit Judge George Buth charged her with contempt
of court and ordered her jailed Sept. 7 until she produced the
children. She was released Oct. 28 when the state Court of Appeals
ordered a stay of the contempt ruling while the case is appealed.
   Since then, Southwell has agreed to supervised visitations until
an independent evaluation of the girls is completed and the judge
rules on custody.
