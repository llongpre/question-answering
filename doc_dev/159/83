   A judge today granted surrogate mother Mary
Beth Whitehead-Gould immediate, unsupervised visitation of eight
hours a week with the child she agreed to bear under a $10,000
contract.
   Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
visits with 2-year-old Melissa Stern would be expanded from one
eight-hour day weekly to two days every other week in September,
overnight visits in April 1989 and two weeks during that summer.
   ``The court finds no credible evidence or expert opinion that
Melissa will suffer any psychological or emotional harm by
continued and expanded visitation with her mother,'' Sween said.
   His order barred both sides in the case from discussing Melissa
publicly, such as in the promotion of books or movies.
   The Sterns had argued during a three-day visitation hearing last
week that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould would use Melissa in a tour to
promote a book she is writing about the case.
   Sween's order doesn't not affect publication of Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's book, however, nor does it have any effect on a
television movie being made about the case.
   The judge also ordered the adults in the case to undergo
counseling to ease the emotional burden on the child, who lives
with her father, William Stern, and his wife, Elizabeth. The
Sterns, who hired Mrs. Whitehead-Gould as a surrogate, have custody
of Melissa
   ``The court finds that Melissa's best interests will be served
by unsupervised, uninterrupted liberal visitation with her
mother,'' Sween said in a written decision given to attorneys.
   ``She and her mother have the right to develop their own special
relationship,'' the judge said.
   In a statement issued by her attorneys, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould
said she was happy her relationship with her daughter ``has been
preserved.''
   ``I am delighted and grateful to know that as Melissa grows up,
we'll have a meaningful and substantial relationship with each
other,'' she said.
   The Sterns were disappointed by the decision, said their
attorney, Gary Skoloff, noting that the Sterns had sought to delay
contact between Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and Melissa for several years.
   ``We did not get the hiatus we asked for,'' said Skoloff. ``They
were pleased with the mandatory counseling. And they were pleased
with the privacy issue.''
   He said the Sterns would make no public statement on the ruling.
   Skoloff had said following the three-day hearing last week that
the couple did not plan to appeal Sween's decision, whatever the
outcome.
   The Sterns argued that visitation should be stopped for at least
six years, while Mrs. Whitehead-Gould sought the gradually
expanded, unsupervised visitation she won today.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, an East Brunswick housewife who turns 31
Thursday, was allowed to visit the child for two hours once a week
under supervision during the legal battle.
   She testified during the custody hearing that her daughter would
benefit by a ``more natural'' relationship with her mother.
   The Sterns said they feared Mrs. Whitehead-Gould could
emotionally harm the child and try to undermine their relationship
with Melissa.
   If there is no appeal, today's ruling would bring to a close a
highly publicized, unprecedented court battle that sparked a
worldwide debate on parents' rights and reproductive technologies.
   The dispute began shortly after the child's birth March 31,
1986, when Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, then married to Richard Whitehead
and the mother of two, decided to turn down the $10,000 surrogacy
fee and refused to hand over the child. No money ever changed
hands. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould is now expecting her fourth child by
her second husband, Dean Gould.
   The Sterns turned to surrogacy because they feared Mrs. Stern,
42, who suffers from a mild form of multiple sclerosis, could
develop complications with the disease during pregnancy.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould fled with the baby to Florida for three
months before authorities tracked her down and returned the child
to the Sterns, setting the stage for the emotional court battle
over custody.
   After a three-month trial, Superior Court Judge Harvey R. Sorkow
upheld the surrogate contract and stripped Mrs. Whitehead-Gould of
her parental rights, ordering her never to see the child again. The
judge then presided over a speedy adoption of the child by Mrs.
Stern.
   But the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned most of Sorkow's
ruling in its landmark Feb. 3 ruling. The state's highest court
outlawed surrogacy-for-pay and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
parental rights, but upheld custody for the Sterns while ordering
the lower court hearing on visitation rights.
