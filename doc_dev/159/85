<LEADPARA>  THAT girls are boy crazy is hardly news.;    The news, according to Newsweek,
is that today's girls are going to extremes to get their boys. Some limit
their aggressive courting behavior to harassing phone calls. Others go
further, sending sexually explicit candygrams.  </LEADPARA>

WHAT'S NEW?  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Across the board, girls are using sexuality as never before in an attempt
to get attention, according to Newsweek.;    Explanations vary.;    Some
social commentators and psychologists say today's little girls are starved for
male affection (absent fathers) at the same time they are inundated with
media-driven images of young women as sexualized playthings (Madonna).;   
What would we do without Madonna?;    The problem is apparently widespread.
Upon publishing a series of letters from mothers of teen-age boys besieged by
such aggressive girls, Ann Landers received more than 20,000 letters of
commiseration.;    Meanwhile, some therapists are crying "double standard."
Girls aren't supposed to be sexual or to want boys in the same way boys want
girls, said one member of the Harvard Project on the Psychology of Women and
the Development of Girls.;    A 15-year-old girl quoted in the article
lamented that boys can "sleep around" and be considered "just it." Girls who
sleep around, on the other hand, are considered "sluts.";    Perhaps this is
the sort of philosophical commentary one can expect when children are engaged
in discussions of adult behavior.;    As a mother of three boys -- ages 7, 14
and 18, I too, am witness to the phenomenon. I don't mind girls calling boys.
But I do mind girls (and boys) who don't identify themselves and who have no
consideration for the fact that most of us do not happily receive calls after
midnight.;    Meanwhile, a 6-year-old girl in my youngest son's first-grade
class was so desperate for the boys' attention that she begged one of the boys
to tie her up.;    By his teacher's account, the begging went on -- and on --
until the boy finally surrendered to her demands. He tied her to a football
field goal post. The only problem was that he tied her neck to the pole and
the girl nearly collapsed before a playground attendant came to her rescue.;  
 An isolated incident? Maybe. But it is hard to deny that something is going
on. To label the trend an escalated form of boy craziness is to do what
parents do best -- deceive themselves.;    It is, indeed, time to bury the
ridiculous notion that girls are not supposed to acknowledge their sexuality.
Girls may come equipped with different hormones than boys do, but they're
every bit as effective in ensuring survival of the species. To acknowledge
one's sexuality is both normal and desirable, especially if accompanied by the
guiding wisdom of a parent.;    But girls, more than boys, receive mixed
messages from our society. They always have.;    When I was a girl in the '50s
and early '60s, Hugh Hefner illustrated in no uncertain terms that we were sex
objects. Our toys -- Barbie dolls -- reinforced the idea that our bodies had
to be perfectly molded if we were ever to have our Kens.;    Today's girls are
told on the one hand that they shouldn't "mess around," or else. On the other,
they're barraged by advertising, media stars and other female role models with
the very clear message that sex paves the road to success.;    The difference
between then and now is the essential "or else." To many young girls today,
the "or else" is an empty threat.;    In my day, "or else" meant you got
pregnant, you lost your friends, your school, your boyfriend, the affection of
your parents, your life, your place in heaven. It was a fairly impressive
deterrent.;    Abortion and a relaxing of social mores have weakened the
deterrent. Which is not to suggest that we go back to the good old days where
girls were unattainable sex objects and boys were boys.;    The key,
undeniably missing, is the understanding that sex is an adult thing. It is for
grown-ups -- for people who have the moral sway to decide whether to have a
family, the integrity and wherewithal to support one, the wisdom to know that
not "doing it" is a reasonable option under most circumstances.;    Besides,
the grown-up truth is no one really admires people who "sleep around," whether
they're male or female. They're just not "it."  </TEXT>
