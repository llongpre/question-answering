<LEADPARA>  ADULT siblings inhabit a twilight zone of family relationships.;    They have
no roles, no rituals, no clear-cut patterns of behavior, a few proscribed but
no prescribed ways of relating -- no relationship at all, sometimes, since as
freewheeling adults theirs is a voluntary association.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  "Sometimes it seems like little more than that -- an association," said Janice
A. Cummings, publisher of Memory Lane Magazine for radio station KXAM in
Scottsdale, Ariz., and the eldest of five siblings ages 22 to 35. "I mean,
sometimes I can't believe that we were all raised under the same roof. I look
at my brothers and sisters as adults and think, 'Who the hell are you?' ";   
Now, it seems, Cummings and tens of millions of other American adults are
going to have to find out. Demographic trends show the emergence of a
generation of grown-ups with more siblings than children.;    Steve W.
Rawlings, a family demographer for the U.S. Census Bureau, projects that as
many as 10 percent of the adult population may not marry during their
lifetime, up from 5 percent in recent years.;    Of women born in the early
1950s, he said, 17 percent are remaining childless in their lifetime, up from
9 percent of women born in the 1930s. Rawlings also noted that overall family
size has been steadily declining.;    With Americans living longer, the
importance of siblings as potential care givers looms large. Their role is
further underscored by the economic downturn and the AIDS pandemic, which are
sending many adults to family members for support.;    That makes siblings
"the ultimate insurance policy," says Deborah T. Gold, a medical sociologist
at Duke University Medical Center.;    "They are the only people with the
potential to know us from birth to death," she said. "They can meet us on an
equal footing not possible in a parent-child relationship. And they are the
only ones who can help us look over the chaos of our lives and make it make
sense.";    More often than not, the summons for help is likely to be
answered.;    Researchers say and siblings agree that there is a deep-seated
sense of obligation for brothers and sisters lurking between the biblical
mandate that they are each other's keepers and the hope that if worst came to
worst, they would come to each other's aid. And there is a shared family
history.;    These ties, however, can often be buried by adulthood.;   
'Dormant emotional tie';  "The adult sibling relationship is a revocable
detachment, a kind of dormant emotional tie that we can mobilize when we
choose," said Ingrid Arnet Connidis, an associate professor in the Sociology
Department of the University of Western Ontario.;    The tie seems to operate
independently of the relationship at times. "After our father died, it seemed
that she was the grieving widow, not my mother," Donald G. Bauchner said of
his sister.;    Bauchner, 50, who is president of the Perfumer's Workshop in
New York, said, "We had a major breakup over this.";    But he said he always
knew she was there if needed. "I just didn't want to put our bond to the
test.";    That bond is begun in childhood, with parents writing the script.
"Many years ago, after her divorce, Mom selected my sister as the one who
would help raise us -- a mini-mom," said Dana Wood, associate beauty editor
for W magazine and Cummings's 28-year-old sister. "I always felt like I could
never be as good as her.";    Psychologists say many parents inadvertently
place children in comparative categories. "One is 'the smart one,' another
'the responsible one' in a unidimensional labeling that can stunt sibling
growth," said Renee A. Cohen, a clinical psychologist in West Los Angeles.;   
Issues of rivalry and favoritism during childhood can be played out later in
grown-up terms, says Matti K. Gershenfeld, president of the Couples Learning
Center in Jenkintown, Pa.;    Outgrowing childhood roles; Popular avenues,
Gershenfeld says, are money -- who has more and how that largess is given and
received among siblings -- and the comparative success of children.;    But
these childhood roles can be tossed aside, as Dr. Gershenfeld knows. Born six
years after the accidental deaths of the first children in the family, she was
the "miracle child" in her family.;    "I was 10 before I realized that
breathing wasn't special," Dr. Gershenfeld said. "Two years after me, my
sister was born. She has had to live with that.";    So the sisters
"intentionally took separate paths to outgrow our parents' definition of me,"
Dr. Gershenfeld said. "We did not attend the same college. We don't even
belong to the same synagogue.";    Not all such sibling baggage is as easily
disposed of. Dr. Gold says she and her colleagues see about 80 percent of
siblings age 65 and older in varying degrees of closeness, 10 percent more in
neutral relationships and the remaining 10 percent in negative relationships.;
   Research, mostly among older adults, suggests, for example, the importance
of family size, with larger families producing closer sibling ties, and the
relative insignificance of birth order.;    A family's race and ethnicity,
even its gender composition, help shape the nature of the sibling bond
throughout its life cycle.;    Adulthood, says Victor G. Cicirelli, a
professor of developmental and aging psychology at Purdue University, reduces
emotional distances after a period of individual family and career building; a
collapsing of age differences under the weight of events that all adults can
experience: marriage, divorce, children, jobs.;    "Today, my younger brother
and I can greet each other as adults in our 40s, with respect for the separate
tracks we took in life," said Barbara G. Nye, vice president of strategic
planning and development for Jostens Inc., a maker of education and training
products in Minneapolis.;    But the same adult events that can strengthen the
sibling bond can readily weaken it.;    Their mother's death, which could have
come between Cummings and Wood, led to reunion. "We can have some fun with
each other when we see each other, now that we no longer have to please
someone who was hard to please," Wood said.;    Caring for parents;  But for
Bauchner, his sister's marriage pushed them apart. "I never cared for any of
her husbands," he said.;    But the need to care for elderly parents has
become a shared concern for Nye and her brother. "We've talked about him doing
the bulk of the work," she said. "But I see him more clearly now as an adult,
and I appreciate the fact that he is more patient with them than I would be.";
   Seeing siblings as adults and renegotiating roles, psychologists say, are
tools with which even damaged relationships can be improved.;    The starting
point is a continued tie to shared memories, even painful memories, said
Stephen P. Bank, an adjunct professor of psychology at Wesleyan University,
and an author of "The Sibling Bond" (Basic Books, 1982).;    The search for
common ground, Dr. Cicirelli says, can be a challenge. "Siblings are brought
up to share certain similarities, values and interests, but life circumstances
can weaken that glue," he said. "Operating counter to that, however, is what I
believe to be a basic drive to preserve the relationship.";    It is that
drive that Cummings sees in many adult sibling relationships.;    "As adults,
we've all been undergoing a renegotiation of roles," she said. "Some of us
have been successful, and some of us not. We all have the capacity to have
incredible arguments, and then get in touch. In the end, we all seem to come
back to each other."  </TEXT>
