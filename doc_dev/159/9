<LEADPARA>  CHILDREN who are held, cuddled and showered with hugs and kisses are more apt
to grow into successful adults than those who "learn discipline" at an early
age, psychologists say.;    Following up on studies conducted 36 years earlier
on a group of 5-year-olds in Boston, the researchers say parental warmth has
more influence on adult social adjustment than any other factor.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although warmth from both parents is significant in a child's ultimate
success, the results lend particularly strong support to the notion that a
father's manner is important to development.;    The study compared mothers'
assessments of the way 5-year-olds were raised in 1951 with the psychological
and social well-being of those same children in 1987.;    "Adults whose
mothers and fathers were warm and affectionate were able to sustain long and
relatively happy marriages, raise children and be involved with friends and
recreational activities outside their marriage at midlife," the authors
concluded in a report released Wednesday in the Journal of Personality and
Social Psychology.;    In comparison, children of cold parents were more
likely to be depressed.;    On the other hand, contrary to the authors'
predictions, there was no significant correlation between "difficult
childhoods" or "parental harmony" and ultimate success.;    Original
information on the manners in which the 5-year-olds were being reared in 1951
was conducted by a team of Harvard University psychologists who interviewed
mothers and teachers of 379 kindergarten-aged children.;    The mothers were
asked to rate the amount of parental affection the child received in terms of
"hugs, kisses, holding and cuddling.";    Both mothers and kindergarten
teachers rated each child on how well he or she got along with other
children.;    In 1987, psychologists Carol Franz and David McClelland of
Boston University and Joel Weinberger of Adelphi University located 78 percent
of the original group for follow-up interviews.;    Their study is the first
to look at the long-term influence of parental warmth on the development of
social skills in adults.;    The researchers used complex statistical
calculations to draw associations between measurements of parental warmth
recorded in 1951 and measurements of social success 36 years later.;    The
"most important finding," they wrote, was a significant association between
cases in which mothers reported parental warmth in child rearing in 1951 and
the child's conventional social accomplishments at age 41.;    The term
"conventional social accomplishments" referred basically to an adult's ability
to maintain a marriage and friendships.;    "It was especially interesting
that father warmth was meaningfully related to later social accomplishment,"
they said. "These results provide more support for the notion that a father's
contribution to his child's well-being is important.";    Children whose
mothers saw them as sociable were not more likely to have higher levels of
social accomplishment.;    On the other hand, girls who did not seek lot of
help from their teachers and boys who got along well with their peers were
higher in social accomplishment.;    There was an odd relationship between a
girl's social class and her ultimate psychological success as an adult, the
psychologists reported: Women from middle-class families tended to be lower in
social accomplishment than women from lower-class families.;    "Perhaps
middle-class women, who were also more likely to get more education than
lower-class women, were more susceptible to cultural messages of the time
regarding alternative roles for women," the authors observed.;    Lower-class
women, on the other hand, may have had fewer options and therefore saw
traditional lifestyles more positively, the researcher suggested.  </TEXT>
