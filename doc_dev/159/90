   The parents of child prodigy Adragon De
Mello agreed Wednesday to have their son named a temporary ward of
the court, temporarily halting plans for him to attend graduate
school.
   Augustin De Mello, the boy's father, said his son intended to
begin advanced studies in mathematics at the Florida Institute of
Technology in Melbourne, Fla., this fall.
   Following Wednesday's court decision, Adragon De Mello will
remain at least six months in the foster home where he has been
since his father was arrested two months ago for investigation of
child endangerment.
   Adragon gained national attention in June when he graduated at
age 11 from the University of California at Santa Cruz after earning
a bachelor's degree in computational mathematics in one year instead
of the unusual two years.
   According to the 1989 Guinness Book of World Records, Adragon is
the youngest college graduate.
   County officials won temporary custody of the child Sept. 19,
after the boy's mother, Cathy Gunn, alleged that De Mello had
threatened violence and previously made a suicide pact with his son.
   Police found five loaded handguns and suitcases filled with
ammunition, but no charges were filed. De Mello, who denied making
the death pact, was taken to a psychiatric institution and he was
under observation little more than a day. Superior Court Judge
Thomas Black made Adragon a ward of the court in an agreement with
the boy's parents, welfare officials and attorneys. He will decide
March 7 whether to make the child a permanent ward.
   Earlier this year, Adragon's mother, Cathy Gunn, filed a lawsuit
to gain custody of the child after Augustin told reporters that the
boy may go abroad for graduate school. De Mello and Gunn, a Silicon
Valley technical writer, lived together until 1986 but were never
married.
