   A psychologist who contended that the
1942 Walt Disney classic ``Bambi'' may be too upsetting for some
very young children to watch says she didn't expect her comments to
create such a stir.
   ``I don't have a vendetta against Bambi. I really don't give a
darn. It was just my ersonal opinion,'' Louise Bates Ames,
associate director of the Gesell Institute of Human Development,
said Wednesday.
   Ames, who for 25 years wrote a syndicated column on child
behavior, told USA Today last week that she personally would not
take a child 5 years or younger to see the G-rated animated movie,
which has drawn large audiences since its recent re-release.
   For very young children, ``possibly their worst fear is they
would lose their mother, or father,'' she said.
   That is exactly what happens to Bambi, the young deer and prince
of the forest whose mother dies off-screen at the hands of a hunter.
   ``It's a movie in which a child loses its mother and there is no
resolution. The mother (is just) gone,'' she said.``I felt it would
be too hard for many children.''
   Howard Green, a Disney spokesman in Burbank, Calif., said the
film contains many moral lessons about life and man's relationship
to animals which ``outweigh any possible complaints'' anyone might
have.
   ``Clearly the film is one of the most respected and critically
acclaimed of all animated films,'' Green said. ``Children have been
seeing it since 1942 and I don't think any damage has been done.
   ``Every Disney film has an element of fright to it, which makes
them so powerful and emotionally involving,'' he added.
   After the newspaper article appeared, Ames said she was
bombarded with telephone calls from all over the country.
   ``The personal calls were from parents who agreed with me,'' she
said. A Boston rabbi who is an authority on how children relate to
dying also was quoted as saying it might be harmful for very young
children to watch the film.
   Some Bambi fans objected, however. Ames participated in a radio
call-in show from Phoenix, during which she received several angry
calls.
   ``One man from New York was very angry. `What do you know about
all this?' he asked. I said this is not a big issue on my mind. I
don't really care,'' Ames said.
   Some callers said that because a deer and not a human died, the
film provides a way to introduce children more gently to the topic
of death.
   But Ames said a young child will not depersonalize the film. ``A
mom is a mom,'' she said.
   Green countered that the death of Bambi's mother is an example
of ``classic understatement. You hear a shot but you don't see
anything.''
   When Bambi realizes his mother has not returned home with him
after telling him to run, it is left to his father to tell him what
happened. The father tells Bambi that his mother won't be with him
any more because man has taken her away.
   Green said the sixth re-issue of ``Bambi'' produced the second
biggest opening last weekend for an animated Disney re-issue _ $7.2
million.
