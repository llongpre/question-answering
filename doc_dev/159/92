Men's Changing Commitments to Family and Work

Basic Books, Dollars 25, 366 pages
WOMEN AND THE WORK/FAMILY DILEMMA
By Deborah Swiss and Judith Walker
Wiley, Dollars 24.95, 255 pages
'Hi, hon, I'm home,' announces Joe Blow, scooping his infant daughter to his
chest as he enters the kitchen of his home in suburban Nowheresville, USA.
'Say,' he exclaims, 'you've scrubbed them dirty pans from last night. I said
I'd do them, when I got a chance. But I've been so busy.'
'How long am I meant to wait, Joe?' interrupts Mary, his wife, as she dabs
infant dribble from her stylish black business suit. 'They made the place
look so dirty, so . . . untidy.
'And talking of busy,' she growls, 'I haven't exactly been sitting on my
butt, Joe; I was up before you this morning, gave my presentation to the
board this afternoon, rushed home to take the kids to the dentist and did
the dishes.'
'Hey,' says Joe, grinning smugly as he pulls a six-pack of beer from the
fridge, 'is it my fault you've got this crazy female obsession with
tidiness? Now, hon, where's my dinner?'
Mary pours a container of hot, E-Z-Cook, low-calorie, microwaved vegetable
lasagne over his head.
So ends another skirmish on the new frontier of western marital life - that
dangerous, uncharted territory where couples grapple with the ramifications
of one of the biggest social changes of the past three decades - the entry
into the workforce of a large percentage of the married female population.
In the US, about 67 per cent of mothers are now employed or looking for work
 -a radical change from the 1950s, when bread-winning husbands and
stay-at-home wives made up roughly two-thirds of American households.
Yet, as both these books point out, western culture and social institutions
have hardly begun to reflect these changes. 'The unspoken assumption
persists that there is still a woman at home to raise the children and
manage the household,' say Swiss and Walker.
Husbands are not keen to swap the power and freedom their breadwinning
fathers enjoyed for greater family involvement. Wives struggle to be
'superwoman', combining the domestic role their mothers trained them to
assume, and the demands of a job.
The business world, while just starting to pay attention to work/family
issues, generally buttresses these positions: men who take time off for
family matters tend to be viewed as wimps. Women who do so risk being
branded 'mommy trackers' - second-class beings who lack the corporate
commitment needed to get to the top.
These books examine life on this frontier, though from very different
perspectives. Swiss and Walker, professional consultants in the work/family
field, interviewed female Harvard graduates, to see how some of the
'brightest and best' of America's new generation of professional women were
coping with the demands of home and family.
The answer: with difficulty. The book explodes the myth that a modern
professional woman can 'have it all' - a career and family - without
suffering considerable physical and psychological stress.
They conclude that the 'glass ceiling' which prevents women reaching the top
because of their sex is 'buttressed by a maternal wall - a transparent but
very real barrier that significantly hinders a mother's ability to balance
successfully work and family'.
The husband's changing role is the subject explored by Kathleen Gerson, an
associate professor of sociology at New York University, in a book which is
long and ponderous, yet original in subject matter and mercifully free of
jargon.
She maintains that men are growing confused about their position. 'As women
have become almost as likely as men to shoulder the responsibilities of
supporting a family, it has become harder for men to defend and justify
advantages based solely on being born male. The demise of a cultural
consensus on the meaning of manhood has left men in a no-man's land,
searching for new meanings and definitions of maturity.'
Her book, based on interviews with American men from all social backgrounds,
argues that men are responding in different ways, with many seeking to hold
on to their traditional breadwinner privileges, but others taking on varying
degrees of involvement with their families. However, even the most involved
fathers still tend to evade what they consider the routine, dirty work of
childcare.
Both books argue that companies need to be more flexible in allowing
employees to balance the demands of work and home. But the vast majority of
US companies, while playing lip service to family issues, would rather not
get involved - and for good reasons: they view this as a private, individual
matter, fear discriminating against employees with no families, or worry
that greater provisions will hurt their bottom line.
They also note that, however flexible a corporation's policies, many women
who can afford to quit work still do so after giving birth, feeling that
their offspring need greater parental guidance than a child-minder can give.
Of course, a man could provide such guidance. But western culture has yet to
accept the idea of the house-husband, not least because of economics: men
are still generally paid much more than women, so in a one-income family it
makes sense for the man to work.
As Gerson points out: 'Women cannot enjoy equal employment opportunites
until men shoulder equal family obligations, and men are not likely to
become equal partners until women enjoy equal economic opportunities.' In
other words, true equality will be a very long time coming.
