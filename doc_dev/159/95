   A man armed with a shotgun broke into a
home early today and killed his ex-wife, their two daughters and
the woman's new husband before killing himself, authorities said.
   The assailant left a suicide note to his parents saying ``he was
sorry for what he had to do,'' said Pierce County sheriff's
spokesman Curt Benson.
   The gunman smashed through a sliding glass door at the rear of
the house and shot the husband as he was calling the sheriff's
office from his bedroom to report the break-in, Benson said.
   When deputies arrived minutes later, shortly after 5 a.m., they
found the gunman's body, Benson said.
   ``We then went into the master bedroom. We found a husband and
wife on the floor. Both died of apparent gunshot wounds.''
   A 6-year-old daughter was found dead in her bedroom, and a
14-year-old daughter was gunned down in the doorway to her room, he
said. Benson identified the assailant as the woman's ex-husband and
as the girls' father.
   Authorities would not confirm the victims' identities.
   Spanaway Fire District Capt. Bruce Carpenter said all had more
than one gunshot wound, apparently from a shotgun and another gun.
   The home is in a quiet, tree-shaded neighborhood about five
miles south of Tacoma.
   Benson said the woman had divorced after a 19-year marriage and
remarried about a year ago.
   A neighbor, Michelle Silvernail, said there had been ill
feelings between the woman and her ex-husband and a custody battle
over the two girls.
   Another neighbor, Jesse James, said he was awakened around 5
a.m. when he heard five shots.
   ``It was so loud, it sounded like it was coming in my house,''
James said. ``They were having a custody fight. They had marriage
problems.''
   Deputies were interviewing the ex-husband's parents, who lived
next door.
   A neighbor, Louise Hollingsworth, said the woman feared her
ex-husband and had called police several times about him.
   Principals at the schools the girls attended said they had told
their pupils of the tragedy and brought in psychologists to counsel
the children.
   ``She was a very nice little first-grade student,'' Principal
Chuck Brock of Evergreen Elementary School said of the younger girl.
   Pat O'Brien, principal at Cedar Crest Junior High, said most of
the student body had heard of the shooting before school started at
7:30 a.m.
   ``I told them what I knew about it during morning announcements
over the intercom,'' O'Brien said. He described the older daughter
as ``a good student, very respected by her teachers and her
friends.''
   The mother was a frequent substitute teacher at the junior high,
O'Brien said.
   ``We knew there were some domestic problems a year or so ago
when there was a divorce,'' he said. ``As far as we could tell it
didn't have an effect on the daughter, and the mother could do her
work very well.''
