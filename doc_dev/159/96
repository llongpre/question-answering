<LEADPARA>  THE horrifying flashbacks are triggered unexpectedly: by dreams, or while they
tuck their toddlers in at night, or during a massage, in therapy sessions,
during sexual intercourse, on their honeymoons.;    The recollections jolt
them full-blown and detailed, or more typically trickle into their
consciousness in loathsome bits and pieces. They are often preceded by
unexplainable bouts with confusion, depression, anxiety, anger, sexual
dysfunction, dread and foreboding, illness. The chaser usually is fear of
going insane.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Wedding-night flashback;  These are the childhood memories no one warned us
about, the freeze-frames of innocence we don't want in our photo albums. Ugly
and tormenting, these are images of childhood trauma and sexual abuse that, in
alarming numbers, adult Americans are dredging up from long-repressed
memories, often decades after the fact.;    In King County, Wash., a
25-year-old woman who'd grown up in a serene and picturesque mountain town
became distraught on her wedding night six years ago when the face of her
elementary-school teacher flashed in her mind as she made love to her husband.
More graphic scenes of childhood gradually returned, sending her in a tailspin
from being a healthy and intelligent adult to an anorexic and suicidal
convalescent. With the help of her therapist and attorney, she filed a civil
suit against the school and the respected, community-minded teacher who, she
now fully recalls, molested and raped her at least 30 times -- starting in the
fourth grade.;    At 56, a New York City man who'd been in therapy for
impotence had a dream that touched off his regaining long-lost memories of an
aunt who had sexually abused him when he was between 9 and 11. When his
parents refused to believe him, all traces of the incidents were buried almost
irretrievably in the depths of his unconscious.;    In a murder trial in
Redwood City last January a 29-year-old woman testified that after 20 years,
she suddenly remembered that her father had killed her childhood playmate.
Gazing at her own young daughter had jarred Eileen Franklin-Lipsker's memory
of the day her father drove her and 8-year-old Susan Nason to a reservoir and
molested the girl before bludgeoning her with a stone. Franklin-Lipsker also
remembered that her father sexually abused and beat her when she was 5. Her
father, George T. Franklin Sr., was convicted of first-degree murder in
November and sentenced to life in prison. He has appealed.;    "Our minds are
incredible. They protect us from what we are unable to bear," says Lynne
Finney. A Utah attorney and therapist who specializes in such cases, Finney is
all too familiar with the psychological plight of adults who were abused as
children. Until she was in her 40s and undergoing hypnotherapy for a variety
of elusive mental and physical problems, she remembered nothing of the first
11 years of her life.;    Hidden reasons;  Finney's first images of abuse
surfaced when a therapist asked her, under hypnosis, if there were reasons in
her past for her illnesses. "Yes," she answered, and saw herself as a child
floating in the hallway of what she has since dubbed "the house of horrors."
She heard herself screaming from behind a closed bedroom door. "I figured
out," she says, "that something terrible had happened to me.";    As a
youngster, Lynne Finney lived in Los Angeles, in what she always believed was
a picture-perfect family life -- her father wrote successful novels and
screenplays and her mother was an artist. What she'd omitted from that picture
was that her mentally ill father sexually abused and brutally tortured her
from when she was 4 until she turned 8. As therapy began to bring back details
of those years -- that he had raped her, hurt her with a fire poker and letter
opener, battered her with his fists, even killed her kitten in front of her --
Finney denied it all at first. Then she thought she was going crazy.
Eventually she felt her entire life had fallen apart.;    "Abused children
have only three choices," says Finney, whose own survival (advocates prefer
the term "survivor" to "victim") led to her writing a 1990 book, "Reach for
the Rainbow," and becoming a therapist. "They can die. They can go insane and
become dysfunctional. Or they can repress it from their conscious minds until
they are able to deal with it.";    Lately, because sexual abuse and incest
have gone public as major mental-health problems, more Americans seem willing
and able to deal with this once-taboo topic. Several celebrities have stepped
forward to set the record straight on their storybook lives: This spring,
former teen movie queen Sandra Dee revealed her story of sexual abuse at the
hands of her stepfather that took 30 years for her to confront.;    Attorneys
talk of a trend in civil actions brought against elderly parents, relatives,
teachers, therapists and others alleged to have abused plaintiffs during
childhood. Roberta Riley, the Seattle lawyer who represented the plaintiff in
the King County case which the accused teacher's employer, the Seventh Day
Adventist Church, settled in April for $1.4 million, says, "It was my first
sexual-abuse case. Now I have millions of them." Fourteen states have now
altered their statutes of limitations in civil cases to allow an adult three
years after recovering a repressed memory of abuse to go to court; at least
another dozen states are considering similar revisions.;    Researchers
estimate the problem nationally has reached near-epidemic numbers: One in four
or five children is sexually abused before reaching age 18; upward of 15
million men and women were abused sexually as children. Experts are reluctant
to approximate how many victims repress the memories.;    Skeptics who point
out that science has yet to demonstrate the reliability of long-term memory
are finding themselves in the thick of an intensifying and emotionally loaded
controversy.;    "There is virtually no scientific documentation of the
reliability of these memories," says Elizabeth Loftus, a cognitive
psychologist at the University of Washington who specializes in long-term
memory and memory distortion. "We do know that false memories are created in a
particular way and the potential for that exists here," she says. "We're going
to have a real problem sorting out the real cases from the false ones.";   
Washington, D.C., psychotherapist Richard Mikesell wonders if the wave of
long-repressed memories of sexual abuse might be a behavioral contagion. "I
think it is really overblown," says Mikesell, who doesn't discount the
emotional trauma resulting from sexual abuse, but worries it is the current
"in" mental-health issue. "It may be an epidemic we're uncovering, but if a
therapist goes looking for something, it is more likely they'll find it
whether it happened or not.";    Many therapists and adults victimized as
children agonize over such skepticism. "It is nonsense," says Lynne Finney,
who is adding to the third edition of her book a new chapter titled "Am I
Making This Up?" in response to such doubts. "You can't deny the photographs
that every police department and every social service agency has of children
with torn vaginas and ruptured rectums," she says angrily. "These things don't
happen by themselves. How is it so unbelievable that these things happened 20
or 30 years ago?"  </TEXT>
