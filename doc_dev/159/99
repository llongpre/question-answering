   One of Yossi Peled's earliest memories was of
the night he was hiding in a house in Belgium when Nazi soldiers
arrived, looking for Jewish children they heard had been given
shelter.
   ``We were in the basement, and I remember the sound of their
boots,'' he recalled, banging his fist on the table to emphasize
the sound of the jackboots. ``It was the most frightening thing I
ever heard in my life.''
   Like Peled, who is now a major-general and commander of Israeli
troops along the borders with Lebanon and Syria, the Holocaust
still haunts Israelis, shadowing private lives and public
decision-making.
   Israel's extreme security-consciousness and the distrust of the
outside world, both byproducts of the Holocaust, are embodied in
politicians like right-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, born
Yitzhak Ysernitzky 74 years ago in Ruzinoy, Poland.
   Shamir's father Shlomo, a Jewish community leader, escaped from
a train bound for a Nazi death camp and sought shelter in a nearby
village.
   ``While seeking shelter among friends in the village where he
grew up, they _ his friends from childhood _ killed him,'' Shamir
recalled bitterly at a remembrance ceremony this year.
   It shaped the thinking of many top military leaders, such as
Peled.
   ``I am sure that whenever a leader has to make a decision, our
background _ our terrible background _ is in his mind,'' Peled, 49,
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Peled, born Jefke Mendelevitch in Belgium, was hidden with a
Christian family in Antwerp before his parents were deported to the
Auschwitz death camp. At Auschwitz, Peled said, his father was
killed and his mother was ``destroyed as a person.''
   The Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews died, left Peled
hypersensitive about the treatment of children _ to the point where
he told friends he would have to leave their house if they could
not stop their baby's crying.
   Partly as a result of this background, Peled said he has clashed
with Israeli-allied Lebanese militiamen in south Lebanon when they
have wanted to use artillery to shell civilian villages.
   ``Hundreds of times, I have put limits on operational activities
to try not to hurt innocent people and, of course, children,'' he
said.
   About 300,000 Israelis who survived the death camps and
persecution still suffer directly, and psychological studies
indicate the side effects have been passed on to a ``second
generation of victims,'' the 800,000 children of suvivors.
   Billy Laniado, head of the Second Generation Society that
represents 1,200 survivors' children, said the Holocaust still has
a pervasive influence in Israel.
   ``Even though we look strong and sometimes appear even rude, in
some ways we still feel very vulnerable,'' she said.
   In Psychologia Magazine, three army psychologists wrote in
November that based on a study of 212 soldiers who suffered shell
shock in the Lebanon war, the sons of Holocaust victims were more
susceptible to stress and took longer to recover than a control
group.
   ``The second generation was raised to correct the damage the
Holocaust caused their parents. The level of expectation increases
pressure on the battlefield but also the feeling of failure in a
soldier who breaks down and suffers from battle shock,'' wrote
Zahava Solomon, Moshe Kotler and Mario Mikulincer.
   Rabbi Menachem Fogel of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial said
in an interview the Holocaust ``is losing force, but it is still
something very vivid and potent and overwhelming in the lives of
those who lived through it.''
   The feeling that there is a real threat of annihilation even
today ``is part of our national psyche,'' he said.
   The Holocaust has deeply influenced Israeli politics, but in
different ways.
   For example, the left is constantly on guard against human
rights violations, and the right is obsessed with security.
   ``One lesson is that you learn to protect your own against any
possible threat. You also learn from the Holocaust that you cannot
persecute people because your own people's persecution has been so
traumatic,'' Fogel said.
   Yehudit Richter, a Tel Aviv University sociologist whose father
was subjected to cruel experiments by Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele,
said the outlook about what to do with the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip is entangled in the Holocaust experience.
   ``My parents feel that while we have the territories we are
strong, and they don't want to give them away,'' she said.
   But Ms. Richter and other Israelis recoil from statements by
Palestinian activists, who often liken the measures used by Israeli
soldiers fighting the Palestinian uprising to those of the Nazis.
   ``This is really enraging,'' she said. ``This (Palestinian
uprising) is not a question of existence. There is no concept of
total destruction, or wiping a people from the face of the earth.''
