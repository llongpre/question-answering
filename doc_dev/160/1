Set to battle over free agents Mark Langston and Robin Yount in what may become 
a Freeway Series of a different nature, the Dodgers and Angels begin the 
process today, when Fred Claire, the Dodgers executive vice president, meets 
with left-handed pitcher Langston and his agent, Arn Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, according to a source, have a Wednesday meeting with Langston and 
Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
Langston is believed to favor the Dodgers, Angels and San Diego Padres on the 
basis of location, but bidding is expected to stretch from coast to coast, and 
began Monday when the 90 players who filed for free agency were eligible to 
accept offers from clubs other than their own. 
</P>
<P>
Langston heard from only the Seattle Mariners, under new ownership since 
Langston, who spent five-plus seasons there, was traded to the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Yount, as a center fielder who can bat leadoff, represents the solution to the 
Dodgers' two most pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Yount is vacationing in Hawaii. The speculation is that, at 34, he is reluctant 
to leave the American League and may be interested in the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tony DeMarco, the agent for free agent pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, 
said the Dodgers have increased their offer from one year to one year and an 
option for 1991, but the money in both years is still less than the $1.85 
million that Valenzuela received in 1989 and far less than the three-year, 
$6-million package that Valenzuela is believed to be seeking.
