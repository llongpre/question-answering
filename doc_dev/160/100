Lance Parrish said the best thing about batting against Nolan Ryan on Monday 
night was seeing a lot of fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
Those fastballs accounted for 11 strikeouts, but Parrish got a good look at one 
in the seventh inning and hit a two-run homer that helped the Angels beat Ryan 
and the Texas Rangers, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"If you swing enough times you can catch up to it," Parrish said of Ryan's 
fastball. "I felt like I was on his fastball. I felt sooner or later I'd catch 
up to one. I didn't hit it good, but it got out." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan held the Angels hitless for 5 2/3 innings and lost despite pitching a 
four-hitter. The 43-year-old Ryan (13-8) took over the major league strikeout 
lead with 221 but was beaten by Mark Langston (10-16), who gave up four hits in 
8 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan struck out Brian Downing and Dave Winfield to start the seventh but walked 
Lee Stevens, who stole second before Parrish hit his 22nd home run on a 2-2 
pitch. Ryan has yielded only 12 runs in his last six starts but is 1-1 over 
that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"Nolie was overpowering," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "Fortunately, Mark did 
a tremendous job of getting out of a bases-loaded situation (in the fourth) and 
Devon White made a super catch in the fifth (leaping against the wall to pull 
down Ruben Sierra's drive with a man on first). I thought that ball was 10 rows 
deep." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, 5-1 in his past eight starts in a season to forget, struck out eight 
and walked seven. He left after Rafael Palmeiro hit his 14th home run with one 
out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey yielded a hit and a walk before nailing down his 24th save and 
66th of his career, a club record. Dave LaRoche held the old mark of 65.
