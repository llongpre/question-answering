<LEADPARA>  Mark Langston will not be the American League's starting pitcher tonight at
the SkyDome, which is just fine with him. After what he went through last
year, just being an All-Star is enough.;    The former San Jose State pitcher
signed a five-year, $16-million contract to join the California Angels for the
1990 season. He went 10-17, and although the Angels scored only 18 runs in
those losses, he was seen as another free-agent flop.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     After this half-season, Langston has begun to justify the expenditure. He
is 12-3, winning two more games than he ever had by an All-Star break. He has
pitched into the seventh inning or later in 15 of his past 17 starts and has
teamed with Chuck Finley to lead California into contention. Why the dramatic
change?;    "Just having a very good team to play for has helped," Langston
said Monday. "We have a different team than last year. We have Dave Winfield
for a whole year, Wally Joyner is healthy and doing well, and we picked up
Gary Gaetti at third base.;    "Defensively, we're extremely sound. We have
the bats to keep us close, and the bullpen, with (All-Star teammate) Bryan
Harvey, has been outstanding. That's all helped.";    Langston spent most of
his career as a bright spot on a bad Seattle team. He made the All-Star team
in 1987, finishing that season with 262 strikeouts in 272 innings. He was
traded to Montreal in May 1989 for Randy Johnson, Brian Holman and Gene
Harris, and he bolted for big money and a big market after that season.;   
Langston began his Angels career by teaming with Mike Witt to throw a
no-hitter, but it went all downhill from there. "I lost four games in a row,
2-1," he said. "Then I got beat around pretty badly and lost confidence. I had
made my living being an offensive, aggressive pitcher, and I lost that. I
tried to pick my spots, and I fell behind in counts.";    Through it all,
Langston never threw so much as a tantrum. He never kicked a water cooler. "To
me, he's an All-Star two years in a row," Angels Manager Doug Rader said. "Not
necessarily from a performance standpoint, but from a character standpoint."; 
  Longtime rival Kirby Puckett of Minnesota said of Langston: "There's nothing
any different about him that I've seen. You just try to make him get the ball
down.";    Langston and Finley each have 12 victories, tying Minnesota's Scott
Erickson for the league lead. At this rate, Langston could have his first
20-win season. He won 19 games in '87, a Seattle record.;    "You can win 30
games, but if your team doesn't get into the playoffs, it doesn't really
matter," he said. "I felt I had a legitimate chance with Montreal. We were in
first for 2 1/2 months before folding, and I still think we had the best team.
Now, even though it's a tough division, we're in a very good position.";   
Langston has come a long way in a season, and a long way since he left defunct
Buchser High School in Santa Clara. He was offered plenty of soccer
scholarships, but there was not much interest in him as a baseball player. His
heart said baseball, and he said Monday with a rich man's grin, "It was the
right decision.";    "I had a good time at San Jose State," he said. "The main
thing there was just that the competition was up a little bit. It was a lot of
fun, and it sent me on my way."  </TEXT>
