The Padres, in hopes that reliever Mark Davis forgets all about this free-agent 
business, offered him a new contract proposal Tuesday, one which they believe 
will convince him to remain in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
While awaiting their answer, the Padres went ahead Tuesday and contacted Arn 
Tellem, the agent for free-agent pitcher Mark Langston, informing him that they 
will pursue the left-handed starter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very interested in him," said Chicago attorney Fred Lane, who will 
conduct the negotiations for the Padres, "and I think they're very interested 
in us." 
</P>
<P>
Lane, who along with La Jolla attorney Beth Benes is conducting the Davis 
negotiations for the Padres, said however that the Padres' first priority in 
the free-agent market continues to be Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a left-hander who saved a Padre-record 44 games in 1989 and was selected 
as The Sporting News' National League pitcher of the year, filed for free 
agency Monday night. But before Davis' agent, Alan Hendricks, even had a chance 
to test the marketplace, the Padres had a new contract proposal awaiting 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We had already made them a fabulous offer, but we made them even a more 
fabulous offer after we learned that they filed for free agency," Lane said. 
"We wanted to give Mark something to think about. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Mark to know that we're very sincere, and how much the Padres want 
him. He knows that from our words. And now he knows that from our numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Lane refused to reveal the Padres' offer, saying, "I don't want to educate my 
competition," but it is believed that it is a three-year guaranteed contract 
for at least $7 million with possibly an option for a fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was unaware of the Padres' new offer Tuesday. Hendricks, his agent, was 
undergoing foot surgery, Davis said, but he's expected to speak with him today 
and discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back to San Diego is still my first choice," Davis said. "Just because 
I filed for free agency doesn't mean that I'm not even thinking about San 
Diego, that's far from my intention. I just want to protect myself." 
</P>
<P>
Davis would not disclose how much it will take for the Padres to keep him, but 
said that he's seeking a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"A contract for more than three years is something I'd definitely like," Davis 
said. "I know they're not common, but it's something I think a team and a 
player could work out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lane: "We can probably work out anything, but we don't want to do 
something nuts. I'm certain everything will work out. We're going to get him; 
we're going to get him. 
</P>
<P>
"This offer is something that'll be so attractive to him that he'll have to 
take it now." 
</P>
<P>
And if Davis and Hendricks continue to explore the possibilities of the 
free-agent market? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, in that case," Lane said, "I'll just hope he's not interested in the 
teams that are interested in him." 
</P>
<P>
While in the marketing mood Tuesday, the Padres officially launched their claim 
in the Langston sweepstakes. They are considered to be among Langston's top 
three choices, along with the Dodgers and Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown just how much it will cost to lure Langston to the Padres, but 
it's almost certain that he will become the highest-paid pitcher in baseball, 
exceeding $3 million a year. The Padres, and every other team with the 
exception of the Montreal Expos, are not allowed to negotiate with Langston or 
discuss monetary terms until after Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres are successful in acquiring Langston, 12-9, 2.39 ERA, they would 
enter the 1990 season with perhaps the strongest pitching rotation in the 
National League: Bruce Hurst, Ed Whitson, Eric Show, Andy Benes and Langston. 
It also would enable them to package one or two pitchers along with a catcher 
to obtain a starting center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also could be in the market for other free agents, such as 
outfielder Hubie Brooks and first baseman Keith Hernandez, but have yet to 
decide if they'll pursue any others besides Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have to sit down, get a list together, and discuss just who fits our 
needs," said Tony Siegle, Padre vice president, player personnel. "It's quite 
obvious we can't sign everybody." 
</P>
<P>
In reality, they'd be ecstatic just to sign a certain pair of left-handers.
