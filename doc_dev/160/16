<LEADPARA>  The California Angels think Mark Langston, the left-hander they signed to a
five-year, $16 million contract last year, is going to bounce back strongly
from his 17-loss season in 1990.;    So does Langston.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LANGSTON HELPS ANGELS TO SERIES SWEEP
HE PITCHES SIX SHUTOUT INNINGS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  A.L. ROUNDUP  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Langston took a step in that direction Thursday when he pitched six strong
innings in a 5-0 victory over his old team, the Seattle Mariners.;    The
victory allowed the Angels, an 80-82 team last season, to sweep the Mariners
in the season-opening, three-game series. It also gave the Angels their best
start since going 5-0 in 1970.;    "He didn't doubt himself last year," Angels
Manager Doug Rader said of Langston. "It's important for anybody to get off to
a good start just simply because it's something to be proud. If he were going
to self destruct, it certainly would have been last year. It wouldn't have
been for an unsuccessful debut in 1991.";    A year ago, Langston was one of
the biggest free-agent flops in baseball, going 10-17 with a 4.40 ERA. His
only highlight came in his debut, exactly a year ago, when he pitched seven
innings against Seattle and combined with Mike Witt in the first of baseball's
record nine no-hitters.;    In Thursday's game, Dave Winfield drove in three
runs for the second straight game. He had a two-run double in the seventh.;   
"It takes a lot of pressure off of you when you've got the runs," Langston
said. "Dave had a really big hit. It gave us a really big lift.";    Langston
gave up a two-out single to Ken Griffey Jr. in the first inning and then
retired 13 straight Mariners before Dave Valle opened the sixth with a
single.;    Langston was lifted when the Mariners loaded the bases on singles
by Edgar Martinez and Griffey and a walk to Alvin Davis. But Jeff Robinson
came in and got the next three outs.;    Robinson got Jay Buhner to foul out
to first baseman Wally Joyner, Pete O'Brien to pop out to shortstop Dick
Schofield and struck out pinch hitter Greg Briley. He retired the Mariners in
order in the eighth and ninth for a save.;    "You can't read too much this
early," Langston said. "But it's very encouraging. It's outstanding to be able
to come in here and take three from probably their three best pitchers.";
INDIANS 6, RED SOX 4: Brook Jacoby drove in three runs and Cleveland spoiled
Danny Darwin's debut in Boston.;    Eric King blanked Boston on three hits
over six innings before tiring and needing relief help in a three-run seventh.
Doug Jones pitched the ninth for his second save.;    Darwin, signed for $11.8
million as a free agent after leading the National League in ERA last season
for Houston, was unimpressive in his first start for the Red Sox.;    The
Indians rocked Darwin for three runs in the first inning and added three more
in the second, the last two coming on Jacoby's wind-blown triple off reliever
Tom Bolton.; BLUE JAYS 7, BREWERS 3: Off-season acquisitions Devon White and
Joe Carter continued to spark the offense and David Wells pitched eight strong
innings as host Toronto beat Milwaukee.;    Carter, acquired from San Diego,
drove in two runs, giving him five in four games while batting .400 for the
Blue Jays. White, traded by California, went 3 for 5 and scored three runs,
giving him five for the season to go with a .389 average.;    Wells (1-0), who
has never pitched a complete game in 28 career starts, allowed three runs on
eight hits, struck out two and walked one.; TIGERS 11, YANKEES 5: Cecil
Fielder drove in three runs and scored four times as Detroit beat visiting New
York.;    Travis Fryman also had three RBIs for Detroit, and Roberto Kelly
drove in a career-high five runs for the Yankees.;    Fielder, who led the
majors last season with 51 homers and 132 RBIs, singled home two runs in the
seventh and drove in another with a fielder's choice grounder in the eighth.  </TEXT>
