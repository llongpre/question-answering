<LEADPARA>  THE morning-after found Mark Langston smiling, for a change.;    He was
happiest about having thrown strikes. He didn't do that last season. He didn't
do much of anything, except collect his paycheck, which was then among the
richest in baseball history.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For $3.2 million, Langston gave the California Angels 10 wins, 17 losses
and a 4.40 ERA. In the bargain, he got a big case of self-doubt, the biggest,
he said, since his junior season at San Jose State in 1981.;    "I lacked
confidence last year," Langston said Tuesday morning. "This year, it's a
different story.";    For Langston, this year officially began Monday
afternoon at Packard Stadium, on the campus of Arizona State University.
There, against the San Diego Padres, Langston pitched three innings of
two-hit, shutout ball. He threw strikes. He threw hard. He won. He did all the
things he was expected to do last season.;    Explaining a season gone bad is
like explaining a marriage gone bad. You've got all kinds of reasons, and no
clue where to start. Which was the biggest? Which was first?;    Langston
insists on this much: The money had no part in it. None.;    When a guy signs
a big contract and then flops, the standard explanation is that he pressed, he
tried too hard to justify the salary he's making. It's tired, but very
possibly true. It's logical. It's in line with what we know about human
nature. But, where it concerns him, Langston fights this notion with the
bulldog tenacity for which he is not known.;    "I never thought about (the
money)," he says. "I don't think any guy could live up to that kind of
contract; you wouldn't even try. You're basically paid on what you've done in
the past, anyway. . . . It wasn't the money.";    The 1990 season began so
promisingly for Langston. Signed to a free-agent contract for five years and
$16 million, Langston made a debut that was worth every penny: He pitched a
no-hitter at Anaheim Stadium. Against his old team, no less. The downer was
that Langston couldn't finish the game; he left after seven innings and even
that had been a gamble, given the short spring training.;    It was mid-August
before Langston won another game at Anaheim Stadium. He lost nine straight
decisions there. He didn't win anywhere between June 5 and Aug. 1, his record
dropping from 4-5 to 4-13. At his worst, he was 5-15. He finished with his
lowest win total since 1985 and his most losses ever.;    "A lot of things
were involved," he said. "Probably, it was more mental than anything.";   
Langston got frustrated, understandably so. In early June, he lost 2-1 despite
12 strikeouts. Two weeks later, he lost again 2-1, despite striking out 10. In
June, Langston had a 2.36 ERA -- and a 1-3 record. And he let it get to him.; 
  "I kept looking at the next start as the one that would turn me around,"
Langston said, "and then, during the course of the game, I'd get defensive."; 
  He'd nibble at the corners. He'd fall behind. He'd walk the guy, or be
forced to come in with a hittable pitch. And the streak went on, including an
8-1 loss at home in which Langston allowed 10 hits in 2 2/3 innings and was
booed off the mound.;    Langston, 30, put in a winter of hard work, riding a
bike to build his legs and endurance. Not that either were a problem last
season.;    He also is ironing out a flaw in his delivery. Not that it
matters, either. Langston noticed the flaw while studying videotape; later, he
discovered he had pitched with the same flaw in 1988, when he went 15-11 for
Seattle.;    So it wasn't mechanics. And it wasn't physical. And, dammit, it
wasn't the money. Whatever it was, it's gone. It's a new year, a fresh start,
and that might make all the difference for Mark Langston in 1991.  </TEXT>
