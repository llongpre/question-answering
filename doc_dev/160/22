Comments: Considered baseball's premier free agent last fall, Langston's 
presence has given the Angels a surplus of quality starters. The left-hander is 
best known for his fastball, which has helped him strike out at least 200 in 
five of the last six seasons, but he also can be effective with a variety of 
breaking and offspeed pitches. Langston has had a tendency to give up the long 
ball -- he allowed 30 or more home runs a season from 1986-88 -- but many came 
inside Seattle's cozy Kingdome. His earned-run average has improved in each of 
the last four seasons, from 5.47 to 4.85, 3.84, 3.34 and 2.74, and he has 
proven a durable commodity. He has been on the disabled list just once in six 
years.
