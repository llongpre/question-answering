THE NEGRO SPEAKS OF RIVERS BY LANGSTON HUGHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've known rivers: 
</P>
<P>
I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the 
</P>
<P>
flow of human blood in human veins. 
</P>
<P>
My soul has grown deep like the rivers. 
</P>
<P>
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young. 
</P>
<P>
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it. 
</P>
<P>
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln 
</P>
<P>
went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy 
</P>
<P>
bosom turn all golden in the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
I've known rivers: 
</P>
<P>
Ancient, dusky rivers. 
</P>
<P>
My soul has grown deep like the rivers. 
</P>
