Maybe it's simply that I no longer understand baseball. I used to; when I was a 
kid, I seemed to know quite a bit about baseball. Maybe I've just gotten stupid 
when it comes to baseball. That's the only logical explanation. 
</P>
<P>
What brought this to mind was a newspaper story reporting that one Mark 
Langston had become the highest-paid player in the history of baseball. 
Langston, a left-handed pitcher, had signed a five-year contract with the 
California Angels for $16 million. No other player has ever received a total 
package of $16 million before. 
</P>
<P>
The story was filled with dollar figures, and there was a nice quote from Mark 
Langston's agent, and then finally -- in the next-to-last paragraph -- was the 
one piece of information I had been looking for: 
</P>
<P>
Langston's record last year was 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
I thought that might be a typo. A pitcher has a season in which he wins 16 
games and loses 14, and he becomes the highest-paid player in the history of 
baseball? 
</P>
<P>
I did some research. Mark Langston, the highest-paid player in the history of 
baseball, has never had a season in which he won 20 games. The season before 
last, Langston had a record of 15-11. Two years before that, he was 12-14. In 
'85, he was 7-14. His career record is 86-76. The highest-paid player in the 
history of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
I called a friend whom I consider a true baseball expert. His name is Rob 
Fleder; he is former articles editor for Sports Illustrated, and now is 
executive editor of The National, the soon-to-debut sports daily. Basically 
Fleder told me that, yes, I was stupid. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where the records lie," Fleder said. "Mark Langston has played 
most of his career for the Seattle Mariners, a terrible baseball team. You 
can't judge Langston's skills by his won-loss record." 
</P>
<P>
That seems to make sense -- at least a little sense. Certainly if Langston has 
spent most of his career with a bad team, it figures that he might not have won 
as many games as he might have with a good team. Still, though . . . a player 
whose lifetime record is 86-76, a player coming off a 16-14 season, getting the 
biggest contract in history? 
</P>
<P>
"He's really pretty good," Fleder said. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure he is. Ted Williams was pretty good, too; many say he was the best 
hitter who ever played baseball. In 1941, the year that Williams hit .406, he 
was just coming off a contract that paid him $10,000 a year. That's not so 
important, though -- $10,000 in 1941 meant something different. What is 
important is what happened much later, in 1959. Williams, for the first time in 
his baseball career, was having a bad year. For the first time ever, Williams 
hit below .300. The Boston Red Sox, knowing how valuable he had been to the 
team and the city, offered him a raise for the next year -- a salary of 
$125,000, which would have been his highest salary ever. Williams turned it 
down. He wanted less. He said he had not performed well, and he demanded a pay 
cut. He got it. The Red Sox paid him $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston (16-14), the highest-paid player in the history of baseball, will 
make $3.2 million a year. "The thing you've got to remember," Rob Fleder said, 
"is that Langston's timing was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Fleder was not referring to Langston's timing on the pitcher's mound. He was 
referring to the fact that CBS television has just signed a $1.1-billion, 
four-year deal to broadcast Major League baseball. This TV deal has made 
baseball's owners incredibly wealthy before they sell a single ticket -- so 
wealthy that they can afford to make Mark Langston (16-14, 86-76 lifetime) the 
highest-paid player in the history of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it really all comes down to Kim LeMasters, doesn't it?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, it does," Rob Fleder said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim LeMasters is the CBS entertainment executive who resigned recently because 
he had a bad streak of luck in choosing the shows on CBS' prime-time schedule. 
Because of Kim LeMasters' losing streak, CBS has been finishing last in the 
ratings. Because CBS has been finishing last, it needed a symbolic programming 
stroke in an attempt to turn the network around. Because CBS needed the 
symbolic programming stroke, it swallowed hard and paid $1.1 billion for the 
rights to telecast baseball. Because it paid the $1.1 billion, the California 
Angels could afford to hire Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
Kim LeMasters may be temporarily out of work, but thanks to him Mark Langston 
(16-14, 86-76 lifetime) is the highest-paid player in the history of baseball 
-- a sport about which I am stupid. Was Ted Williams stupid, too?
