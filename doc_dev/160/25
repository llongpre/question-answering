The proposition for Mark Langston, the baseball player, is really quite simple: 
does he want to be a left-handed pitcher or a lanceur gaucher? Does he want to 
be known as a strikeout king or le roi des retraits au baton? 
</P>
<P>
 Can he cope with an environment where an earned-run average is a moyenne des 
points merite with an accent over the "e"? Where his fastball is known as the 
rapide and his slider as a glissante? And his curve is spelt courbe? The 
changeup is a changement de vitesse? A walk is a but sur balles? 
</P>
<P>
Does Kevin Mitchell look any easier to pitch to because he's a frappeur instead 
of a power hitter? Is a home run any easier to give up because it's a coup 
circuit? Is it any more comforting to give up a base hit when it's described as 
a coup sur? 
</P>
<P>
Like to see your shutout referred to as a blanchissage. Would you? 
</P>
<P>
French is a beautiful language. I mean, it's got words such as Beaujolais and 
mon petit chou. It's the language of love. 
</P>
<P>
But is it the language of baseball? Does the game lose something in 
translation? Ballplayers who play the game in Montreal tend to feel they're on 
a demonstration tour of southern France. "You never feel as if you have a home 
game," Ron Fairly, who played there for five years and rolled up several 
hundred coups sur, once observed. "The weather was very changeable. It ranged 
from bad to terrible. The announcer used to come on in the morning to predict 
the day would be 'cold and windy with intermittent daylight.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston is the curious case of a guy who belongs on Broadway but finds 
himself playing Bridgeport. Or Peoria. Or, as in his case, a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of the best pitchers in the grand old game but found himself on the 
mound for the Seattle Mariners. That's like Caruso winding up in a barber shop 
quartet, Laurence Olivier in "Smokey and the Bandit II." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners are less a team than a sitcom. Pitching in the Kingdome is not a 
job, it's a sentence. Four times in its brief history, it has been the home run 
capital of the world. Most of those were hit by the visitors. The "power" 
alleys are a laughable 357 1/2 feet, the foul poles are 316 feet away. Umpires 
have to be careful invoking the infield-fly rule. It might turn out to be a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
Finding yourself in the Kingdome with Jose Canseco is like finding yourself in 
an elevator with a lion. Nevertheless, Mark Langston won 19 games in this 
closet in 1987, a year when 218 home runs rattled out in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
Langston learned early on the importance of geography. Pitching in that 
glorified tent, Langston won 17 games, led the league in strikeouts, even had 
two shutouts, in 1984, his rookie season. Nobody even looked up. Meanwhile, 
over in New York, another rookie pitcher, Dwight Gooden won the same number of 
games, did not lead the league in strikeouts and only had one more shutout. 
But, he became rookie of the year, Doctor K, and, the next year, Cy Young 
winner. Langston became What'd-you-say-his-name-was-again? 
</P>
<P>
Old What's his name has more lifetime strikeouts than Dr. K. He has led the 
league three times in strikeouts. He struck out 16 in a game (against Toronto) 
last year. He just missed a no-hitter, throwing a one-hit game against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he had to hire a Hollywood publicity firm to get his name in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
He played in the Kingdome on a team that finished last two of the five seasons 
he pitched there and next-to-last in two others. He knew he had to get out of 
there. So, he forced a trade. And he got to go to -- ta, da! -- Montreal! 
</P>
<P>
Now, Montreal is not exactly the show-biz capital of the world. It's a nice 
place to visit, but I wouldn't want to pitch there. At least in Seattle, they 
knew he was a hurler and not a lanceur. And Mark has no great desire to become 
Doctor Retraits Au Baton. He probably knew he was in trouble the minute he 
stepped off the plane and someone addressed him as mon vieux (old friend). The 
trouble with Montreal is their heroes come with hockey sticks attached. 
Everyone else is Coco Laboy. 
</P>
<P>
So, when does Mark What's-His-Name get to play the Palace, trod the boards at 
the Old Vic, so to speak, get on prime time? He needs a compass, not a curve. 
Fame and fortune lies south and Langston seems to be looking for the Northwest 
Passage. One more move and he'll need a dog sled. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal would like to keep him. He's the best lanceur they've got. But the 
Expos would have liked to have kept Andre Dawson, Gary Carter, Rusty Staub and 
Warren Cromartie. They all went over the wall. Tim Raines tried. Andre Dawson 
even signed a blank contract at Chicago rather than go back over the border. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal took a calculated risk in trading for Langston. He becomes a free 
agent at the end of the year. Montreal is hoping he will find their city rich 
in Old World charm. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's gerant (manager), Bob Rodgers, is acutely aware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I know. Everybody wants to play in Southern California or New York," he 
admits. "What we have to do is convince them we have a first-class operation 
here, that it doesn't snow in Montreal in July, and that it just might be one 
of the best places in baseball to win a pennant." 
</P>
<P>
Gerant Rodgers acknowledges lanceur Langston, who has won 10 games for the 
Montreal Expos since his escape from Seattle, will be avidly sought when he 
reaches free agency this fall. "He has great stuff, but he's a pitcher not a 
thrower. He could mean a pennant to a number of teams. I would hope one of them 
would be us." 
</P>
<P>
Langston is unsure. He admits he is pitching this year with his bags packed and 
the car running and double-parked. "But, what I wanted basically was to get 
into a pennant race. I had never been in one and I like having the games mean 
something." 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what the French word is for pennant. Up to now, of course, they 
haven't needed one up there. If they don't get one this year, the word for 
Langston next year may be au revoir.
