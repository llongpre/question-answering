Mark Langston's signing with the Angels wasn't the best news Sandy Alderson 
heard Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, congratulate the Angels," said Alderson, general manager of the World 
Series champion Oakland Athletics. He paused, obviously thinking about his own 
club's concerns. "I think," he added somberly. 
</P>
<P>
Angel players and coaches exulted over the signing of Langston, interpreting 
the addition of the 29-year-old left-hander as a sign of the club's commitment 
to the future and proclaiming that his $16-million, five-year contract won't 
spark envy among his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting a World Series ring on our fingers at the end of '90, that's the only 
thing we're thinking about," right-hander Bert Blyleven said. "I don't think 
the players are jealous. Other people see the big money, but we don't talk 
about that among ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased we got Mark Langston. He's been very consistent and I know he 
wants to play on a winning ballclub. This shows that (General Manager) Mike 
Port really wants to put a winning team on the field. I think everybody in the 
organization has to feel pleased." 
</P>
<P>
And apparently they do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," Wally Joyner said. "I think this will help us close the gap 
between us and the A's. One of the reasons we went after Mark Langston was to 
better the ballclub. This is not going to do anything but improve our club and 
our staff. Hopefully, down the line there's a couple of players left that they 
might sign." 
</P>
<P>
Marcel Lachemann, the Angels' pitching coach, was skeptical about the news 
until he was repeatedly reassured that Langston's signing was certain. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the case, it's great," said Lachemann, whose staff's earned-run 
average of 3.28 was second-best in the American League last season. "Obviously, 
we've improved the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark's been a great pitcher in our league before he went over to the National 
League. It's an indication that (owner Gene) Autry and Mike Port are really 
concentrating on trying to win. They realize we had a very fine year but came 
up eight games short. This is an indication they want not just a winning 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"When you say winning, you talk about being over .500, but really winning is 
what Oakland did this year, winning the pennant and the Series." 
</P>
<P>
Lachemann said he knew Langston casually from the pitcher's time in Seattle and 
is already looking forward to working with him in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"I was relatively eager for spring training three days after the season ended," 
Lachemann said. "This makes everything that much easier." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven is also anticipating Langston's arrival because he expects to reap a 
financial benefit of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Now maybe Chuck Finley will leave me alone and won't bother me to buy him 
lunch all the time," Blyleven said. "Mark Langston makes more money, and Chuck 
will probably hook onto him now."
