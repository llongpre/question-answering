When the Seattle Mariners turned down some big names to get three young 
pitchers for Mark Langston last month, it raised plenty of eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners, it turns out, may have known exactly what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Holman earned his first American League victory and Gene Harris got his 
first major-league save Sunday at Cleveland as the Mariners beat the Indians, 
6-3. Holman and Harris both came in the trade with the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Johnson, the third player obtained from the Expos, pitched three-hit ball 
for 7 2/3 innings in Saturday's 3-1 victory over the Indians, improving his 
record with Seattle to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what I see a lot," Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "That's three top quality 
arms and three competitors out there. I'm tickled to death for us." 
</P>
<P>
Holman (1-1) allowed seven hits, including a homer, double and single by Pete 
O'Brien, in Brian Holman 
</P>
<P>
5 2/3 innings. Harris worked the final 3 1/3 innings for the save. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not Mark Langston," Holman said. "We're Randy Johnson, Gene Harris and 
Brian Holman. People are never going to be satisfied if they're looking for us 
to be Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe I was trying too hard to impress people (at first) because it 
was a big trade." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Bill McGuire hit his first major-league homer, a three-run shot off 
Bud Black, in a four-run sixth inning that made it 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Black (5-7) yielded five runs, two of them earned, on seven hits in 5 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Texas 1 -- Dave Parker and Mark McGwire hit back-to-back homers in 
the sixth inning as the A's increased their AL West lead to three games over 
the Angels by downing the Rangers at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (8-4) allowed Texas three hits in 6 1/3 innings, lowering his 
earned-run average to 1.91. Greg Cadaret got one out and Gene Nelson retired 
all seven batters he faced for his first save and Oakland's 23rd, tops in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
The A's had a 2-1 lead when Parker led off the sixth with his ninth home run 
and McGwire followed with his 12th, both off Kevin Brown (5-3). McGwire also 
had a sacrifice fly in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, Chicago 2 -- Randy Bush hit a two-run homer and Kirby Puckett 
added a two-run single, leading the Twins past the White Sox at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Anderson (7-4) allowed eight hits in seven-plus innings and got solid 
relief from Juan Berenguer and Jeff Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
Berenguer entered with a 4-1 lead, the bases loaded and none out in the eighth. 
He retired Ivan Calderon on a foul pop and struck out Carlos Martinez before 
walking Dan Pasqua to force in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Reardon came on to get the side out and pitched a scoreless ninth to register 
his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Melido Perez (3-8) lost for the fifth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Detroit 0 -- Mike Flanagan and Duane Ward combined on a four-hitter 
at Toronto and the Blue Jays handed the Tigers their fourth shutout of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan (4-5) allowed three hits in seven innings. It was his first outing 
since a sore left shoulder forced him to miss two starts. Ward finished for his 
fifth save, striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto rookie Junior Felix went four for five with a two-run homer. Rookie 
Mike Schwabe (1-1) shut out Toronto until the fifth, when Rance Mulliniks 
doubled and Felix hit an 0-and-2 pitch into the second deck for his fifth home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 3, Baltimore 1 -- Rob Deer doubled home the go-ahead run in the ninth 
inning at Baltimore and the Brewers handed the Orioles their fourth loss in 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, leading the AL East, won eight straight before their recent slump. 
Milwaukee has won eight of 12. 
</P>
<P>
B.J. Surhoff got a bunt single with one out in the ninth against Kevin Hickey 
(1-1), who gave way to Gregg Olson. Surhoff stole second and third before 
coming home on Deer's double. Deer took third on Mike Felder's single and 
scored on Olson's wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Crim (5-3) pitched one inning to get the victory. Dan Plesac worked the 
ninth for his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4-8, Boston 2-7 -- Rickey Henderson snapped an eighth-inning tie with 
a run-scoring pinch single to win the nightcap and Don Mattingly drove in six 
runs as the Yankees swept the Red Sox at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly hit a pair of two-run homers in the second game and had a two-run 
double to back the pitching of Andy Hawkins (6-7) in the opener. Hawkins 
allowed four hits and two runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly was five for eight for the day and has 40 runs batted in this season. 
His second home run gave New York a 7-2 lead in the seventh inning of the 
second game, but the Red Sox rallied for five runs off Lance McCullers to tie 
the score. Scott Nielsen (1-0) halted the Boston rally and got the win.
