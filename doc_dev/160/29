The Angels knew for whom the rally bells tolled Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
With 34,370 fans at Anaheim Stadium ringing the souvenir bells they had 
received upon arrival, the Angels rallied from a three-run deficit in the sixth 
inning on Dante Bichette's third home run of the season to pull even with the 
Oakland A's at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
But Oakland scored two runs in the 12th to win, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Mark Langston, who pitched seven hitless innings against Seattle 
last Wednesday in his previous start, did not approach that form Tuesday. He 
gave up seven hits, including home runs to Carney Lansford and Mark McGwire in 
the third inning, and left after six innings. The Angels rallied in the bottom 
of that inning to tie the score, ensuring that Langston would not be the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was charged with four earned runs and made a throwing error on a 
pickoff play to set up the fifth Oakland run. He struck out six and walked two 
while making 105 pitches, a hefty total for so short a stint. He made 98 over 
seven innings last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A victory by the Angels would have given them a 6-2 record and equaled their 
best starts. They had 6-2 records after eight games in 1970 and '74. 
</P>
<P>
A's starter Mike Moore, once a teammate of Langston's in Seattle, gave up three 
runs Tuesday. Reliever Todd Burns gave up the three-run home run to Bichette, 
who leads the Angels in home runs with three. 
</P>
<P>
The question of what Langston would do for an encore was answered quickly. As 
during his no-hitter, he walked the leadoff hitter, Rickey Henderson. But the 
pattern was broken when the second hitter, Carney Lansford, rapped a single to 
right. Langston got out of the inning with the help of an excellent pickoff 
throw to second that caught Rickey Henderson leaning, but he couldn't escape 
the third inning unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
The A's did their damage with two outs. Third baseman Carney Lansford powered a 
1-and-0 pitch a few rows into the left-field seats, and Jose Canseco followed 
with a shot up the middle that blew past Langston's upreached glove and into 
center field. McGwire followed by reaching down for Langston's first pitch and 
slamming a home run deep to left field. It was his third home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Langston did recover his poise, striking out two in the fourth inning for a 
total of five. He had struck out three Mariners in his seven hitless innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels could do little against Moore until the fourth inning. Wally Joyner 
walked and scored when Chili Davis blasted a 2-and-0 pitch 420 feet to center 
field that pulled the Angels to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Langston seemed to settle into a groove in the middle innings. He struck out 
the last two batters of the fourth and first man in the fifth for a total of 
six strikeouts before Rickey Henderson bounced a ground-rule double down the 
left-field line. Canseco followed with a double off the wall in left, scoring 
Henderson for a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The A's padded that to 5-2 in the sixth, without benefit of a hit. Dave 
Henderson drew a leadoff walk and went to third when Langston threw away an 
intended pickoff throw to first. Henderson held at third on Terry Steinbach's 
grounder to third, but with the squeeze play on, Lance Blankenship laid down a 
perfect bunt up the first-base line that allowed Henderson to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels then tied the score with one swing of Bichette's bat. Johnny Ray 
beat out a grounder to third for an infield hit and Joyner barely missed a home 
run, sending center fielder Dave Henderson crashing into the wall to make the 
catch. That was all for Moore, who was relieved by right-hander Todd Burns. 
</P>
<P>
Burns threw four straight balls to Davis, who had switched to the left side of 
the plate. That brought up Bichette, a right-handed hitter, who slammed a 
3-and-1 pitch over the center field fence. The drive was measured at 422 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
A's Manager Tony La Russa said his club wasn't taking this series against the 
Angels lightly. "You can't waste a golden opportunity to take your best shot," 
he said. "It's kind of unusual because we play them two and then don't see them 
for three months (July 23-26 at Oakland). We can't waste these games." 
</P>
<P>
His team didn't waste any games in the first week of the season, winning five 
of six. "The truth is, we had a solid first week," he said. "The starting 
pitching, relief pitching, hitting. The only problem is that it was last week, 
not this week." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa also said his team is aware of the defensive exploits of Angel 
outfielder Dante Bichette, who had five assists last week, but isn't about to 
change its strategy. "We know he throws well. We knew that last season," he 
said. "Still, our style is to push. If there's a guy on second base and there's 
a single to left field, unless the ball is in the guy's hand, we're going to 
send him. You don't take foolish chances, though." 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson's first-inning walk was the 1,000th of his career, fifth among 
active players. Dwight Evans, Willie Randolph, Keith Hernandez and Brian 
Downing are ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being on the disabled list, Bob McClure, Dick Schofield and Bill 
Schroeder will make the upcoming road trip. Trainer Ned Bergert said Schroeder 
(sore right elbow) is throwing again and is feeling better. However, Schroeder 
will still see Dr. Paul Jacobs, who surgically repaired his elbow in 1985, 
Friday. Schofield (strained right hamstring) is running and hitting but not 
taking grounders. McClure (inflamed left elbow) is undergoing therapy to 
strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels set a club record with sacrifice hits in five consecutive games 
before Tuesday. . . . Every player on the 27-man roster except Sherman Corbett 
had played before Tuesday night.
