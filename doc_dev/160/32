Bryan Scott, one of the co-producers and co-creators of San Diego's "Suds" went 
to London and got a staff writing job with the British Broadcasting System. The

The Old Globe will need two actors to fill actor Richard Easton's shoes when 
Easton misses two performances of "Hamlet" to take a part in the new Kenneth 
Branagh film "Dead Again." Easton had been playing a double role as the Ghost 
and Claudius. William Anton will fill in as Claudius and MFA student Will 
Crawford will play the Ghost Oct. 9 and 10. . . .

Old Globe associate artist Kandis Chappell will play a television producer in 
the fourth episode of this season's "L.A. Law." John Vickery, whose last San

Chappell's lawyer. . . .
