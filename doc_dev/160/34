<LEADPARA>  You could almost hear the plop, plop and fizz, fizz Saturday night, the sound
of American League West general managers reaching for relief after they heard
what Ron Darling did.;    Those G.M.s could discount the trade that sent
Darling to the A's because his numbers with the New York Mets and Montreal
Expos said he was a high-risk acquisition. They could discount his debut --
seven innings of two-hit, shutout work against Seattle on Monday -- as a
one-time fluke. But how can the G.M.s write off Darling's second superb outing?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He limited the California Angels to three hits over seven innings in the
A's 3-1 win, and afterward he took a measure of satisfaction in proving his
critics wrong.;    "The last year and a half, for whatever reason, there's
been a lot of negative stuff said about me, and I haven't answered it. I still
won't," Darling said. "Those people have got their opinions. I still think I
can pitch.;    "I think the biggest thing for me is one, to be given the
opportunity to pitch for a good ballclub and two, knowing that they really
want me out there. That's a nice feeling as opposed to what it's been like
over on that other coast.";    The A's can't say enough about what Darling,
5-8 with a 4.37 ERA in 20 starts in the National League this season, has done
on this coast. He had been shipped to Montreal on July 15 because the Expos
wanted to unload Tim Burke's salary. The Expos gave Darling away for two
obscure minor league pitchers a half hour before the July 31 trading
deadline.;    The A's were willing to assume $600,000 in salary and
considerable risk. And Darling's making a difference in the West race. The A's
won their fifth straight and cut the gap between themselves and the
front-running Minnesota Twins to three games. The Chicago White Sox stand
between the A's and Twins, a game out of first.;    Mark Langston (14-6)
hasn't beaten the A's in nine consecutive starts. He lost a no-hitter in the
sixth on Dave Henderson's 24th homer.;    Darling wasn't fazed. His composure
must have been comforting for a team that has watched its starters pitch
erratically all season. He left the bases loaded in the second, then made
perhaps the play of the game in the third when he picked off Luis Polonia at
second.;    "How much of the season do we have left? How many starts does he
have left?" A's Manager Tony La Russa asked. "Just keep doing that, getting
into the seventh or eighth inning and giving up nothing. Whew.";    The play
of the game unfolded so quickly that La Russa marveled. Polonia opened the
bottom of the third with a double off left fielder Willie Wilson's glove, and
Darling walked Wally Joyner. With one out, Darling threw to second, and
shortstop Mike Bordick applied the tag.;    "I had no idea. I'd never seen
him. But that was a hellacious pickoff move," La Russa said.;    Darling sent
accolades Bordick's way, saying Bordick's play and catcher Terry Steinbach's
pitch-calling were the keys.;  HOW THEY SCORED;    A's 6th -- Gallego walked.
Bordick sacrificed, moving Gallego to second. Wilson grounded out, moving
Gallego to third. D.Henderson homered. A's 2, Angels 0.;    A's 8th -- Gallego
homered. A's 3, Angels 0.;    Angels 8th -- Klink pitching. With one out,
Joyner doubled. Winfield walked, and on Klink's wild pitch, Joyner went to
third. On Klink's wild pitch, Joyner scored. A's 3, Angels 1.; OAKLAND
