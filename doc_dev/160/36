<LEADPARA>  The laws of nature took Tuesday night off -- a good thing for the A's Ron
Darling and Dave Henderson, but not so good for California's Mark Langston.;  
Darling again showed the American League what a washed-up National Leaguer can
do. And Henderson again was his usual less-than-neighborly self to Langston
(15-7), winless in three complete games against the A's this season.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Together, they produced an inexplicable 3-2 victory over the Angels that
allowed the A's to remain six games behind A.L. West-leading Minnesota, a 10-5
winner over Seattle.;   Darling (3-0) reached the eighth inning for the first
time in four starts for the A's. More important, he was successful the second
time he faced the Angels, debunking the theory that pitches considered a
mystery the first time around would be easily solved the second.;   "If you
throw good pitches, it doesn't matter who's up there," Darling said. "In a
sense, it's easier for me, because they (the hitters) haven't seen me before,
but I haven't seen them.;   "I don't know. I'm not Bill James.";   In four
starts and 26 1/3 innings with the A's, Darling has allowed 16 hits and five
earned runs, for a 1.69 ERA. He has given up fewer hits and runs in four
starts than he did in his last two in the N.L., for Montreal.;   "I trusted
the people I talked to in the N.L.," Manager Tony La Russa said. "The people I
talked to were all Ron Darling fans.";   Henderson's mastery of Langston is
even stranger. Though they're next-door neighbors in Seattle, Henderson holds
squatter's rights whenever the two are together in Oakland or Anaheim.;  
Henderson went 2 for 3 against Langston, with both singles contributing to A's
runs. Henderson is 10 for 12 against Langston this season and 16 for 34 (.471)
lifetime.;   "It's more the luck of the draw. I've hit the ball, and it's
fallen in," Henderson said. "It just so happens Mark's on the mound. I
wouldn't make much more out of it than that.";   Like Darling, La Russa
referred to a baseball authority in trying to explain it.;   "That's why they
have that Elias thing, that this guy hits that guy," he said. "Everybody has
somebody -- I never had anybody -- but everyone else has somebody they hit.
That shows you how important confidence is.";   If not for Henderson, Langston
might be 18-4 and the Cy Young Award front-runner. Instead, he has come away
with losses of 4-3, 3-1 and 3-2 in his last three starts against the A's.;  
Langston also had errors to blame for Tuesday's loss.;   Both A's runs in the
third were unearned. Second baseman Luis Sojo failed to catch a high throw
from shortstop Dick Schofield in the third, negating what might have been an
inning-killing double play. Instead, Henderson's single sent Mike Bordick home
from second, and Rickey Henderson eventually scored on Terry Steinbach's
sacrifice fly.;   The fifth-inning error, though, was made by Langston. His
pickoff attempt on Rickey Henderson at second bounded into center field,
eventually leading to another run scored via a sacrifice fly.;   "It's
disappointing," Langston said. "It is very frustrating.";   Nature-defying,
too.; HOW THEY SCORED;   Angels 3rd -- Parrish was hit by a pitch, took second
on Sojo's sacrifice and third on Schofield's groundout. Polonia singled,
scoring Parrish. Angels 1, A's 0.;   A's 3rd -- With one out, Bordick walked.
R. Henderson reached first on a fielder's choice, with Bordick safe at second
on second baseman Sojo's fielding error. D. Henderson singled, scoring Bordick
and moving R. Henderson to third, and D. Henderson took second on the throw.
Canseco was walked intentionally. Steinbach's sacrifice fly scored R.
Henderson. A's 2, Angels 1.;   A's 5th -- R. Henderson walked. D. Henderson
singled, moving R. Henderson to second. R. Henderson took third and D.
Henderson second on Langston's throwing error on pickoff attempt. With one
out, Steinbach was walked intentionally. Jacoby's sacrifice fly scored R.
Henderson. A's 3, Angels 1.;   Angels 8th -- With two out, Polonia singled and
stole second and third. Abner singled, scoring Polonia. A's 3, Angels 2.;
