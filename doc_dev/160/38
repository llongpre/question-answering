Joel Skinner's strategy at the plate seems to be a simple one: Ignore a 
pitcher's past glories, forget his notoriety and never consider him unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy's got a ball in his hand and you try to hit it," said Skinner, a backup 
catcher for the Cleveland Indians. "You take pride in what you're doing, that's 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner had reason to be proud Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in place of Sandy Alomar Jr., Cleveland's All-Star catcher who was 
sidelined by a sprained left thumb, Skinner had a double off starter Mark 
Langston, a three-run home run off reliever Willie Fraser and scored twice to 
help the Indians defeat the Angels, 8-1, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
His homer to left, his first of the season, came on a 3-2 pitch in the third 
inning. It gave Indians a 7-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point in time, I was just trying to work myself back in the count," 
said Skinner, who was playing in only his 25th game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to make contact. . . . Striking out has always been a thorn 
in my side. My ratio is not all that good." 
</P>
<P>
Going into Sunday's game, Skinner, a former standout at Mission Bay High School 
in San Diego, had struck out 24 times in 66 at-bats. The last time the Indians 
met the Angels in Cleveland, July 1-2, Skinner struck out four times in five 
at-bats, but also received a bases-loaded walk. 
</P>
<P>
The last time he faced Langston, on May 30 at Anaheim, Skinner drove in two 
runs with a single in a 4-2 Cleveland victory. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner shrugged when asked about his success against Langston, whose record 
fell to 4-12 with the loss Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a tough pitcher over my career," said Skinner, 29, and a six-year 
veteran of the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have much luck against him when he was in Seattle. I think coming 
into this year, I only had one or two hits against him." 
</P>
<P>
But Skinner was sharp Sunday. After Felix Fermin grounded to third to lead off 
the second inning, Skinner hit a breaking ball down the left-field line for a 
double. He scored on Jerry Browne's single to give Cleveland a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Skinner also played a part in an impressive outing by starter Greg 
Swindell, who improved to 6-5 after giving up six hits and one run in eight 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He did real well," Swindell said of his catcher. "I think with him and Sandy, 
we have two of the best catchers in the league. I tend to know him better than 
I know Sandy anyway, so it was nothing (to pitch to him). I never had to shake 
him off once." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner said it was just a matter of making the most of his opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"You just try to contribute," he said. "You can't go out and play for yourself 
-- that's a key part of being professional. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing people don't realize is that it's a lot of fun to play. And when you 
get to, you make the most of it so you can keep playing."
