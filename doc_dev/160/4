<HEADLINE>  THIRTY YEARS AGO, LANGSTON HUGHES WROTE A BLACK
NATIVITY PAGEANT THAT REMAINS ONE OF A KIND
GOSPEL CHRISTMAS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     His early poem "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" (1922), written the summer
after he graduated from high school (1922), is still a landmark work,
anthologized in countless college texts and collections. Later works were
built on speech rhythms derived from the blues and jazz.;   He won poetry
prizes and a writing scholarship to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania at a
time when blacks in the fine arts were almost as rare as unicorns. Though
circumspect about his sexual orientation, he also was honest about being gay
in a culture that has always viewed homosexuality with suspicion.;   In
addition to his own writings (poetry, novels, stories and an autobiography),
Hughes also translated the work of Federico Garcia Lorca and Gabriela Mistral
from the Spanish, wrote the lyrics to Kurt Weill's naturalistic folk opera
"Street Scene" and collected black poetry and folklore for two standard
anthologies published in the '50s. He also created a popular comic-strip
character, Jess B. Semple, who lived on the funny pages of the New York Post
for many years.;   In 1967, just before his death, he published "The Panther
and the Lash," a final burst of bitter poetry about the betrayal of
African-Americans by the compromises of civil rights.;   And in 1961, he wrote
"Black Nativity," a Christmas pageant with gospel music.;   Betty Gadling,
minister of music at Allen Temple Baptist Church in Oakland, saw a production
of "Black Nativity" on television in the '60s, featuring Alex Bradford. She
obtained a copy of its still-unpublished script and spent years tracking down
its music.;   Some of the music was gospel standards, such as "Go Tell It On
the Mountain," and familiar Christmas carols. But some of it, like "Rise Up,
Shepherds, and Follow," she had never heard, she said.;   She located what she
could, with the help of several friends' collections and the library of the
American Baptist Theological Seminary of the West at the University of
California, Berkeley's Pacific School of Religion.;   "The rest we wrote," she
said matter-of-factly. Who is "we"? "Well, me," she answered.;   The result is
an annual "Black Nativity" production, performed by 47 singers from the temple
choir and a dance group.;   In this, the pageant's 10th year, it has expanded
to two weekends of performances and has traveled to Richmond and Sacramento.
Next year, the production has an invitation to perform at a church in San
Mateo.;   Gadling describes it as ideal for children and families. (It runs
about two hours and 15 minutes.) The first act tells the story of the Nativity
in song and dance. The second is a '40s revival meeting, led by a preacher
(Michael Johnson, who is a deacon at the temple).;   Why is it important?
"It's the only black thing of its kind," says Gadling. And Langston Hughes
wrote it.; Black Nativity; By Langston Hughes; Producer: Allen Temple Baptist
