LANGSTON DOESN'T BLAME TEAMMATES FOR HIS 4-11 MARK

The Angels' paltry offensive efforts in his support are unfortunate, Mark 
Langston says, but he doesn't believe they are the product of resentment toward 
him as a newcomer or his $16 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who was a free agent when he signed a five-year deal with the Angels 
last winter, has lost his last six decisions, is 1-8 with three no-decisions 
since a victory May 15 at Milwaukee and is 4-11 overall. During his 19 starts 
this season, opponents have outscored the Angels, 57-45, while he was in the 
game. His next start is Sunday against Cleveland at Anaheim Stadium, where he 
is 1-6. 
</P>

"Not at all," he said when asked if jealousy might play a part, however 
subconscious, in his teammates' stingy production. "I've never felt that. There 
have just been some tough losses. If there is, they keep it to themselves. I 
haven't seen it. Maybe it's something you (reporters) think about, but I don't. 
They realize I'm a human being and I'm out there competing like everyone else. 
I'm the first to admit I wish things were a lot different than what they are, 
but you win as a team and you lose as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Langston said his Christian faith helps him endure. "I pray to the Lord and put 
a lot of it on Him," the 29-year-old left-hander said. "I go out with the 
ability He gave me and do my best to pitch as capably as I can. The results 
haven't been there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Every game I'm going out expecting to win. I feel every time I go out there I 
have a very good opportunity to win and I look forward to every one of my 
starts. I've never been one to put that much pressure on myself. I'm a poor 
loser and I don't like to lose. I'll never be satisfied with losing. That's 
what's been frustrating through this whole ordeal. Even though I pitch decent, 
I've made mistakes and they've turned out to be big mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' offense hasn't given him -- or Jim Abbott -- much room for error, 
but he refused to condemn his teammates. "This is a team-oriented situation. 
You can't blame one person," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't feel compelled to satisfy observers who expect him to put up big 
numbers because of the numbers on his paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true, my contract is large," he said, "but what they pay me for is to 
give the best I can give. That doesn't guarantee anything, which is sad. I give 
everything I've got every start I have, and the way I look at it, that's what 
I'm paid for." 
</P>
<P>
After his last start, a 3-1 loss to Milwaukee on Monday, Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said Langston was pitching well enough to be on the verge of 10 
consecutive victories. Langston smiled at the thought, but he isn't thinking in 
such grandiose terms. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be very nice, but I've got to win one before I can win 10," he 
said. "I have to look at it one game at a time."
