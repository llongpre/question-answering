<P>
First Dave Winfield kept the Angels in a game they had won for seven innings, 
nearly lost in the eighth and then were forced to work overtime to gain some 
semblence of control. His catch in the 14th inning kept the game under control. 
</P>
<P>
Then he scored the winning run in the 16th inning on Dante Bichette's topper to 
give the Angels a 9-8 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers Friday night in the 
longest game of the season for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Minton was the winning pitcher after being activated from the disabled 
list earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Wags here say the Brewers' emblem, which features a ball nestled safely in a 
glove, would be more accurate if it depicted a ball falling out of that glove. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers are the American League's worst fielding team, and they showed how 
richly they deserve that distinction Friday when they committed six errors. 
</P>
<P>
The errors gave Milwaukee 87 for the season. The Angels are second-worst at 76. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by the six Milwaukee errors, the Angels scored more runs for pitcher Mark 
Langston Friday than they did in his last five starts. That was all to no avail 
because Langston, who had lost his last four decisions, was unable to protect 
leads of 5-2 and 8-4. In his last 10 starts since he was an 8-3 winner over 
Milwaukee on May 15, Langston is 1-6 with three no-decisions. Overall, the 
29-year-old left-hander is 4-9. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was charged with seven earned runs Friday in 7 2/3 innings, raising 
his earned-run average to 3.71. He walked five and struck out four for a total 
of 107 strikeouts in 119 innings. He leads the Angel staff in innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
The six errors -- which included a hat trick on three routine plays by 
shortstop Kiki Diaz -- tied a Brewers' club record set on July 26, 1978, 
against the Angels. The muffs undermined the efforts of starter Dennis Powell 
and reliever Jaime Navarro and rendered seven of the Angels' eight runs 
unearned. 
</P>
<P>
The only untainted run resulted from Dave Winfield's two-run home run in the 
sixth inning, Winfield's 10th homer of the season. It followed an error by 
third baseman Gary Sheffield on a grounder by Johnny Ray. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 3-0 lead in the first inning on the springboard of second 
baseman Jim Gantner's error on a grounder by leadoff hitter Brian Downing. 
Lance Parrish drew a bases-loaded walk to force in the first run, and Dante 
Bichette drove in two more with a single to left. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee got two runs back in the bottom of the inning when Langston struggled 
with his control. He walked three, then yielded a two-run single to Greg Brock 
with two out, continuing his habit of allowing a high percentage of two-out 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz's first error, on a Dave Winfield grounder, allowed Downing to score for a 
4-2 Angel lead after he had walked, moved to second on a single and to third on 
a grounder. The Angels added a run in the third inning when Bichette doubled 
and scored when Diaz threw away Jack Howell's grounder for a two-base error. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers cut their deficit to 5-4 in the fifth. Singles by Diaz and 
Sheffield put runners on first and second, and Dave Parker -- Milwaukee's lone 
representative in Tuesday's All-Star Game -- drove them in with a double that 
rolled past the glove of center fielder Bichette. Winfield, the right fielder, 
recovered in time to throw back to the infield where a relay beat Parker to 
third base. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's home run into the left-field seats gave the Angels a 7-4 lead, and 
they added a run in the seventh inning on singles by Howell and Schofield and 
an error by Sveum, who had replaced the hapless Diaz at short. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee erased that lead by batting around in the eighth against Langston and 
Mark Eichhorn. All of their runs were scored with two out, and the tying run 
scored on Sheffield's perfectly executed squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
The danger began when Rob Deer walked with one out. Brock doubled past Wally 
Joyner at first, sending Deer to third. The Angels turned Greg Vaughn's 
fielder's choice grounder into an out at home, although Deer didn't appear to 
touch the plate and catcher Lance Parrish didn't appear to tag him. 
</P>
<P>
The inning continued when B.J. Surhoff lined a single past Langston's head, 
scoring Brock and moving Vaughn to third. That was all for Langston, who threw 
124 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn struggled through the rest of the inning. Sveum singled to center, 
scoring Vaughn, and Jim Gantner singled to right, scoring Surhoff. Sheffield 
scored Sveum with the fourth run of the inning when he bunted toward third, a 
slow roller Jack Howell charged but couldn't play in time to first. Robin Yount 
ended the inning by grounding into a force play. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels loaded the bases in the ninth by working out three walks (one 
intentional) against Milwaukee reliever Dan Plesac, but the Brewers got out of 
that jam with a rare bit of fine fielding. The Brewers pitched carefully to 
Dick Schofield before walking him to get to Downing, and Downing vindicated 
that decision by bouncing into a double play, third to home to first. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Bryan Harvey left the club to be with his father, Stan, who suffered a 
mild heart attack Thursday in North Carolina. A club spokesman said Harvey will 
get as much time off as necessary. Stan Harvey, 47, was in guarded condition 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader said Harvey's absence had some influence on his decision to 
activate Greg Minton off the 60-day disabled list Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Minton arrived at County Stadium at 12:30 p.m. planning to run and pitch in a 
simulated game, not expecting to be activated. "I walk in and Doug says, 'We're 
not going to simulate you today. We're going to stimulate you,' " Minton said.
