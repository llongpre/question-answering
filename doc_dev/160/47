MIKE PENNER: PORT EMPTIES POCKETS WITH BOLDEST MOVE

You pay 16 mil and what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston on the mound, but you shouldn't stop yet. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels looked back in time and far into the '90s all at once Friday 
afternoon as they completed what easily ranks as the boldest move of the Mike 
Port era. Hello, Mark Langston. Halo Mark Langston. Sixteen million buys a lot 
of fastballs these days. 
</P>
<P>
This is how the Angels used to do it. This was the Buzzie Bavasi buzz-saw 
approach to baseball -- annual shoot-outs at high noon with George Steinbrenner 
for the biggest free agents in the land. 
</P>
<P>
That it failed more often than it worked is a lesson that had altered the 
course of Angel history during the past decade. Memories of Bill Travers and 
John D'Acquisto die hard, and once they added Reggie Jackson to the payroll in 
1982, the Angels sought safe asylum from the free-agent wars. 
</P>
<P>
We would build from within, the Port credo read. 
</P>
<P>
We would hazard no risk. 
</P>
<P>
We would be cheap. 
</P>
<P>
After tentatively testing the waters last winter and getting the chill from 
Nolan Ryan and Bruce Hurst, the Angels finally decided to damn the torpedoes 
Friday. More than just taking the plunge, the Angels went in cannonball style. 
</P>
<P>
No one gets five-year contracts anymore? 
</P>
<P>
No one makes more than Rickey Henderson? 
</P>
<P>
They do now. 
</P>
<P>
Time out should be taken to commend Port and Gene Autry for doing the right 
thing. Considering that the Oakland Athletics still reside in the American 
League West, it was really the only thing. At least now, the Angels can say 
they have a fighting chance. 
</P>
<P>
Just don't let them say they're done. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the Angels still lack anyone approaching the offensive talents 
of Jose Canseco. Or Rickey Henderson. Or Mark McGwire. Or Carney Lansford. 
</P>
<P>
No one currently wearing a halo is going to contend for a batting championship 
any time soon. No one is applying for admission into any 40-40 club. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels don't even have a leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Steps remain to be taken before thoughts of catching the A's can be undertaken. 
Langston was an important one, but let it only be the first one. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any money left for Robin Yount? 
</P>
<P>
As long as the Angels are in the mood, a second strike is in order. Yount, 
baseball's next $3-million man, is presently renegotiating with his present 
employers, the Milwaukee Brewers. Reportedly, Brewer General Manager Harry 
Dalton recently asked Yount what it would take to re-sign him. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, Yount replied, "Sign Mark Langston." 
</P>
<P>
If Yount still wants to share clubhouse space with Langston, he knows where to 
look. 
</P>
<P>
If not, the Angels, at last, have some bargaining power at the trade table. 
They have a surplus of designated hitters (Brian Downing and Chili Davis), a 
surplus of second basemen (Johnny Ray and Mark McLemore) and, now, a surplus of 
starting pitching. 
</P>
<P>
A package for Joe Carter or Vince Coleman or Eric Davis or Danny Tartabull is 
no longer out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
The new question is: Which starting pitcher to trade? Mike Witt is the obvious 
choice, but his dreadful 1989 numbers (9-15, 4.54) have diminished his market 
value. The Angels' best hope is finding a buyer willing to take a flyer on a 
still-young (29) former ace who won 16 games as recently as 1987. 
</P>
<P>
With old right-hander Bert Blyleven and young left-handers Chuck Finley and Jim 
Abbott entrenched in the rotation, Kirk McCaskill's name might start making the 
rounds. Getting by more on finesse than power since his 1987 and 1988 arm 
problems, McCaskill's 15-10 record last season reopened some eyes. Kansas City, 
among others, is said to have a keen interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels can also use some help in the bullpen, and there's the Lance Parrish 
matter to attend to, so if Port is truly intent on closing the gap in the AL 
West, his work has really just started. 
</P>
<P>
But Langston is some first domino. He was the one everybody in Nashville was 
waiting to see drop, the action that had to be taken before 25 other teams 
could react. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the games may begin. 
</P>
<P>
And who would have cast the Angels as trend-setters, as catalysts? Finally, for 
the first time under Port, the safety of the sidelines has been abandoned for a 
spot in the front line. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Big A stands for aggressive.
