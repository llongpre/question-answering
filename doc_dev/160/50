Mark Langston's mastery of the Minnesota Twins Tuesday night came far too late 
to affect the American League West division race, but the rediscovery of his 
poise and control has come in time for him to grab a few shreds of hope from an 
otherwise dreadful season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been a real flustrating year. It hasn't gone too well from my 
standpoint, and the one thing I want to do is finish strong and come out next 
year and be more aggressive," Langston said after he and the Angels overpowered 
the Twins, 9-0, before a crowd of 21,908. It was only his third victory in 15 
starts this season at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to finish consistent and let the team behind me know I can do the 
job and get a little confidence in myself. I'll be able to block this season 
out as quick as possible and work very hard over the winter and be ready next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Langston (9-16) allowed four hits, struck out six and walked one in earning the 
fourth victory in his last five decisions and his first shutout since Sept. 17, 
1989, when he was with the Montreal Expos and defeated the New York Mets, 1-0. 
The shutout, achieved on 102 pitches in 2 hours 19 minutes, was also his first 
in the league since April 8, 1989, when he was with Seattle and beat the 
Angels, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
"That was perfect. Just great," Manager Doug Rader said. "He changed speeds 
well and had a nice ratio of balls to strikes. . . . I think he's finally 
starting to feel better about everything, and that's great. He's persevered and 
worked his tail end off, and I'm very happy for him." 
</P>
<P>
Rader had much to be happy about. The Angels scored twice in the first inning 
off starter Kevin Tapani (11-7), who left after three innings to protect a 
strained rib-cage muscle that had prevented him from pitching since Aug. 13. 
They scored again in the fourth on Jack Howell's run-scoring single off Roy 
Smith. They pulled away in the fifth on Johnny Ray's double-play grounder and 
Dave Winfield's two-run home run to center, the 373rd home run of his career, 
and made it a romp in the ninth when Kirby Puckett misplayed Luis Polonia's 
single for two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis ended a one-for-27 slump with three hits and an RBI, but in the 
night's lone negative note, he aggravated the sore back that sidelined him for 
five games last week and his status is day to day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is for all the times we didn't score for (Langston). Now we're even," 
Winfield joked. "We're just playing loose, getting hits and playing good ball. 
Home cooking, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, who was three for four Monday and two for four Tuesday, credited his 
resurgence to adjustments he has made at the urging of hitting instructor Deron 
Johnson. He also credited, as he called it, "that announcement July 30," 
referring to Commissioner Fay Vincent's sanctions against former New York 
Yankee general partner George Steinbrenner. Before that announcement, Winfield 
was hitting .231 with 37 RBIs. In 34 games since then, he's hitting .320 (40 
for 125) for an overall average of .259, with 22 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I got an emotional boost at that point," Winfield said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Langston is getting an emotional boost from his strong finish, although he 
won't permit himself to think about how different the season might have been 
for him and the Angels if he had pitched this well. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened and I'm disappointed with the way it's turned out, but I just look 
forward. I can't do anything about what happened in the past," he said. "The 
flustrating part is we know we're such a better team than the way we've 
played." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
A decision on Manager Doug Rader, whose contract expires after this season, is 
unlikely before Friday. General Manager Mike Port had said he would confer with 
Rader this week to discuss plans for next season, but Port is attending owners' 
meetings in Pittsburgh and won't return until late Thursday. No meeting between 
the two has been set, and Rader declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette was miffed to see his name omitted from the groups of hitters 
for batting practice Tuesday, although he was told it was inadvertent. "They 
don't even know I'm here," he said. . . . Kirk McCaskill plans to complete the 
season rather than move up his elbow surgery, which is scheduled for the 
off-season. "It's important for me to finish because I've been hurt two of the 
last three years and it wouldn't be very good for my career to make it three 
out of four," said McCaskill, who will have bone spurs removed from his right 
elbow. "Plus, I'm still able to pitch. (Continuing) isn't threatening my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill was reinstated off the disabled list although his sprained left 
wrist is too sore for him to hit. He was available as a defensive replacement. 
. . . Max Venable sprained his right ankle in a fall down stairs at home 
Tuesday and was unavailable. . . . Devon White has had more than 100 strikeouts 
for the third time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' Quad Cities farm club won the Class-A Midwest League title, but 
Boise lost in the Class-A Northwest League finals to Spokane, which is owned by 
the family of Angel broadcaster Ken Brett. The Angels' triple-A Edmonton club 
has lost the first two games of the best-of-five Pacific Coast League 
championship series with the Dodgers' Albuquerque club. . . . Larry Casian, who 
attended Lakewood High School and Cal State Fullerton, will make his first 
major league start tonight for Minnesota.
