During postseason play, Rickey Henderson said that he was a money player. 
Oakland Athletics negotiators have an idea that he plays fiscal hardball during 
the off-season, too. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson got a $12 million reward Tuesday for helping the Oakland Athletics 
win the World Series, signing the first four-year baseball contract since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The A's also included a no-trade clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, first to sign a four-year deal since Ken Oberkfell with Atlanta in 
1985, gets a $1 million signing bonus, $2 million in 1990 and $3 million in 
1991, 1992 and 1993. It makes him baseball's second $3 million-a-year player. 
Minnesota Twin center fielder Kirby Puckett agreed to a $9 million, three-year 
contract last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arn Tellem, who represents free agent pitcher Mark Langston, was pleased to 
hear about Henderson's four-year deal, calling it an encouraging break with the 
owners' pattern of the last few years. He couldn't predict what impact it would 
have on Langston's negotiations, but added that length of contract will be a 
factor in Langston's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm asking for a five-year deal," Tellem said. "I'm waiting for someone to 
step forward and offer five years." 
</P>
<P>
There are rumors that Gene Autry, the Angels' owner, has already done that, but 
Tellem said he wouldn't comment on specific aspects of his negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's agent, Richie Bry, said his client "has the largest guaranteed 
contract in baseball, by a wide margin." 
</P>
<P>
"My heart was set on playing in Oakland," said Henderson, 30, an Oakland 
native. 
</P>
<P>
A's General Manager Sandy Alderson knew he needed to act fast to avoid giving 
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner a chance to lure Henderson back to New York. 
The Yankees traded him to Oakland on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson was named the outstanding player in the playoffs against Toronto, 
batting .400 with two home runs, five RBIs and eight steals.
