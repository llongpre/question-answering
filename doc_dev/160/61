<P>
With one minor variation, Mark Langston struck the same losing chord Monday as 
he has so often this season. 
</P>
<P>
His 3-1 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers at Anaheim Stadium represented a change 
from the 2-1 defeats he seemed destined to absorb, but the end result was of 
prime importance -- and the loss was the same result he experienced in his 
previous five decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Deer broke a 1-1 tie in the seventh inning with a home run to left, and the 
Brewers added another run on a pair of singles around a walk as Langston (4-11) 
took his eighth loss in 12 starts since May 15. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, anytime you lose there's an error in your work," 
Langston said. "The home run to Deer, that's the situation I mean. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it's not difficult, because it is. I can't say how much I want to 
turn it around, but I can't dwell on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't laying (the pitch to Deer) in, but I obviously was trying to throw a 
strike. He was swinging in that situation. You expect it." 
</P>
<P>
In the span since May 15, Langston has three no-decisions and one victory, June 
5 at Kansas City. In his last six starts, he is 0-5 with one no-decision and a 
4.14 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the 29-year-old left-hander is 1-6 in nine starts, having won only on 
April 11 when he combined with Mike Witt to pitch a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have scored 15 runs in the 11 games he has lost and had scored only 
nine runs at the time of his departure. They got 11 hits Monday, and one Angel 
was thrown out at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Angels' three-game winning streak and spoiled a memorable 
night for rookie first baseman Lee Stevens, who got his first major league hit 
in his first at-bat and drove in the Angels' only run in the fourth inning off 
Ron Robinson (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was recalled from triple-A Edmonton late Sunday to take the place of 
Wally Joyner, who went on the 15-day disabled list because of a possible stress 
fracture in his right kneecap. 
</P>
<P>
Using Joyner's glove because some of his baggage had been lost, the 23-year-old 
power hitter had two singles and a double in his first three at-bats and 
commanded enough respect for the Brewers to summon ace reliever Dan Plesac to 
face him with two out and two on in the eighth. Stevens struck out, sending 
fans scurrying toward the exits. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who was batting .293 with 16 home runs and 66 RBIs in 90 games with 
the Trappers, led off the second by lining a single to right off Robinson in 
his first major league at-bat. Recognizing the importance of the feat, the 
crowd of 24,643 rewarded him with a round of applause. The ball was thrown in 
from the outfield for Stevens to save as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' glory was short-lived. He was thrown out stealing second, but trotted 
back to the dugout to the accompaniment of scattered cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel I'd be this successful. I felt it would be a learning experience 
from Day 1," said Stevens, who singled in each of his first two at-bats and 
doubled in the sixth before striking out against Plesac with the tying run on 
second in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I can make something out of this chance they're giving me. I made 
something out of my minor league experience and I will make something out of my 
major league experience." 
</P>
<P>
He also made a quick lunge to snare a liner by Dave Parker in the eighth that 
Milwaukee Manager Tom Trebelhorn called, "as impressive to me as anything," but 
was less successful in trying to score from second in the sixth after he had 
doubled and Hill singled. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really happy and excited (about the promotion). I didn't get a whole lot 
of sleep (Sunday) because we were out celebrating our anniversary last night," 
said Stevens, who brought his wife, Kim, to the game. "It's been a nice week 
for me. A nice present. . . . Hopefully, we'll get a win tomorrow instead of a 
loss." 
</P>
<P>
Not even Stevens' heroics could save Langston. 
</P>
<P>
Through four innings, Langston had yielded one hit, on a ground ball that might 
have been scored an error. Shortstop Dick Schofield cut in front of second 
baseman Donnie Hill to play Bill Spiers' bouncer and fumbled the ball while 
taking it out of his glove and throwing. But Langston wasn't ruffled, and he 
ended the inning by getting Jim Gantner to tap the ball back to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens made himself the new fan favorite in the fourth inning, when he drove 
in the Angels' first run, then took second baseman Gantner out at second base 
to avert a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield led off the fourth by beating out a bouncer to deep short. Lance 
Parrish broke his bat, poking the ball through the hole between first and 
second, moving Winfield to third. Stevens didn't wait to see any more of 
Robinson's repertoire and grounded the first pitch into right field, scoring 
Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
When Hill grounded to short, Stevens barged into Gantner and bothered him 
enough to make him throw too late to get Hill at first. Bichette ended the 
inning by grounding into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers pulled even at 1-1 in the sixth. Gantner began things with a sharp 
grounder that deflected off Hill's glove for a hit. He moved to second when 
Robin Yount grounded a single through the left side and scored on Sheffield's 
single to center on a two-strike off-speed pitch. Langston was able to bear 
down and strike out Parker and do the same to Greg Vaughn on a 3-and-2 pitch. 
Those were Langston's fourth and fifth strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens further endeared himself to the crowd by lining a double to left-center 
field past the outstretched glove of Yount with two out in the sixth. But on 
Hill's single to left, home plate umpire Mark Johnson signaled that Stevens was 
out on a fine throw by Vaughn and a good block of the plate by catcher B.J. 
Surhoff. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
With Wally Joyner on the 15-day disabled list because of a possible stress 
fracture in his right kneecap and Lee Stevens at first base, the Angels used 
their 89th lineup in 90 games. Should tests Monday on Chili Davis' lower back 
show a problem, Manager Doug Rader's lineup juggling could intensify. Davis 
wasn't available Monday, but word on his condition is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the Toronto ballclub and the talent they have and they don't have 
a set lineup," Rader said. "If you use a set lineup, people accuse you of being 
set in your ways and not imaginative. If you use a lineup you think is best on 
a given day, people say you're tinkering too much."
