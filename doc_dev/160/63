   Former hostage Frank Reed will return home
Sunday from the U.S. military base where he underwent medical
checkups after 42 months in captivity in Lebanon, his daughter said
today.
   Marilyn Langston, 33, said Reed called her this morning to tell
her he would come Sunday to Malden, where his wife and 9-year-old
child live with his mother.
   Since he returned to the United States, Reed has been held under
observation at the Malcolm Grow Medical Center at Andrews Air Force
Base.
   ``It will be exciting to have him come across Massachusetts
soil,'' Langston said.
   Reed's wife Fahima shared the excitement. ``I'm delighted. I
can't wait,'' Mrs. Reed said. She and their son, Tarek, saw Reed in
Frankfurt, West Germany, when he was released.
   Langston said Reed's 91-year-old mother, Leota Sprague, who
didn't travel to Germany, was especially eager to see her son.
   ``I think what's kept her going for the past three and a half
years is (that) this day will come. She's been weary lately and
she's just anxious to see him and once she sees him and touches him
that will be very, very wonderful for her,'' Langston said.
   Reed was head of the private Lebanese International School in
1986 when he was seized from his car by gunmen. He was held by
Moslem extremists for the next 3{ years.
   Released last month, Reed, 56, told of being beaten when he
tried to escape and of being chained and blindfolded for months at
a time.
   Thursday, Langston said her father told her he had regained
about 15 pounds of the 50 pounds he lost. She also says his energy
has much improved.
   ``He's been playing golf. They've had him out on the golf course
at the base. He's also been undergoing physical therapy to get him
going.'' Langston said.
   Upon his return, Reed will be taken home by limousine with a
police escort, Langston said. She said she believed he would be in
the city's Memorial Day parade.
