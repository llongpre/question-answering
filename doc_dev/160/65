Now or never? 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Montreal Expos to trade pitching prospects Randy Johnson, 
Brian Holman and Gene Harris for the Seattle Mariners' Mark Langston isn't a 
now or never situation, but it's close. 
</P>
<P>
Call it: Win now or, perhaps, not again in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a calculated gamble -- three prospects for a proven pitcher who becomes 
a free agent at the end of the season, and had already rejected a three-year, 
$7.1 million contract from the Mariners and looms as difficult to sign for the 
Expos. 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of our team is in its prime," Montreal Manager Buck Rodgers said. "We 
think we can win this year and felt we needed a top-line pitcher. We tried 
Holman. We tried Johnson. We felt they are still a year or two away. We felt we 
couldn't wait to break in a young pitcher with most of the team in its prime. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had to go out and get someone who can win now. I asked one of our 
scouts about Langston and he said that if he had his pick of five pitchers to 
start a rotation, Langston would be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We know he's turned down a lot of money, that he obviously thinks he's in the 
(Frank) Viola, (Roger) Clemens, (Dwight) Gooden, (Orel) Hershiser class, and he 
may very well be. We're going to try like hell to sign him. We know that with 
the money he's asking, the exchange rate and the aspect of living in a foreign 
country, the odds aren't good, but we think the chance to win outweighs the 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos have had little success in luring top line free agents across the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
They retained Tim Raines -- with help from collusion -- and lost Andre Dawson. 
They signed a quality second baseman, Dave Cash, in 1977 and pitcher Ross 
Grimsley, who went on to become the only 20-game winner in franchise history, 
in 1978. A fading Pete Rose signed for part of the 1984 season. Otherwise, the 
free agent cupboard has been filled with generics. 
</P>
<P>
Langston has already spent more than five seasons in the comparative anonymity 
of Seattle. He wants his place in the spotlight, the big market. A California 
kid accepting Montreal? 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't there anywhere else?" he reportedly asked agent Arn Tellum after the 
Mariners agreed to the Expos offer when Langston and Tellum turned down the 
$7.1 million proposition late Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers, as he said, knows the odds. 
</P>
<P>
He also knows that the potential of a Johnson, Holman and Harris often goes 
unfulfilled. He knows his fourth and fifth starters have a 1-13 record this 
year, that he has had to send Pascual Perez to the bullpen with an 0-7 record 
and that Raines will be 30 this year, Tim Wallach will be 32 and Hubie Brooks 
33. 
</P>
<P>
There is one other thing. 
</P>
<P>
He knows the New York Mets are vulnerable and the National League East is up 
for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mets are like everyone else now. They're not the super team they were two 
or three years ago," Rodgers said. "I said that in spring training and still 
believe it. They have problems like the rest of us. They can be beat, and I 
feel we can put together the club that can do that. 
</P>
<P>
The new Seattle rotation? It wasn't clear immediately, but apparently Johnson, 
the 6-foot-10 former USC left-hander who was 0-4 before being sent out by the 
Expos, and Holman, who is 1-2, will join Scott Bankhead, 2-4 entering a weekend 
series in Milwaukee, Erik Hanson (4-4) and Bill Swift (2-0) as the starters. 
That's a cumulative 9-14 and a new test for Jim Lefebvre's managerial skills. 
</P>
<P>
Just off the disabled list, his ailing hamstring still not 100%, Kirk Gibson 
agreed to move from left field to the more demanding center field for the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Just off the disabled list, his ailing hamstring still not 100%, Eric Davis 
opted to play it safe, moving from center field to the less demanding right 
field for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
It's a temporary transition that Davis would like to make permanent. "I'd like 
to move," he said the other day. "It would probably add another four or five 
years to my career, but I don't expect it to happen soon. If you have a real 
good center fielder, that's a rarity. And I take pride in being a real good 
center fielder." 
</P>
<P>
Walt Hrniak, who defected from the Boston Red Sox to join the Chicago White Sox 
and become baseball's highest salaried batting coach at $500,000 a year, is 
earning his pay, helping elevate the team batting average more than 25 points 
from last year's .244. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's revolving door pitching staff, however, has baseball's worst 
earned-run average, and General Manager Larry Himes refuses to use youth and 
inexperience as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from 39-year-old Jerry Reuss, the other nine Chicago pitchers are all 29 
or younger with an average age of 25.2. Himes went on a Chicago radio show the 
other day and said eight of his 10 pitchers seemed to belong in the minors. He 
excused only Eric King and Bobby Thigpen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting ready to wave goodby to some of these guys," Himes said. "It's 
like driving a car with four blowouts. I'm fed up and disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
Himes' comments followed a one-hour meeting with Manager Jeff Torborg in which 
they decided to demote Ken Patterson and Jose Segura and call up Jeff Bittiger 
and Jack Hardy, the 13th and 14th pitchers to appear for the Sox this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dog Days: It rained so hard Monday night in Cincinnati that it appeared that 
the Reds and St. Louis Cardinals would be unable to play. 
</P>
<P>
However, Reds management waited two hours past the scheduled start, then 
ordered the game to begin. Two innings later, the umpires ordered the field 
covered, and one hour and 15 minutes after that, at 11:25 p.m., they called it. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Magrane, the St. Louis starting pitcher, concluded that Reds owner Marge 
Schott was to blame for even thinking the game could be played. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the phenomenon before of the master taking on the appearance of the 
dog," Magrane said, alluding to Schott and her St. Bernard, Schottzie. "That's 
already been established. But I never heard it went as far as the master taking 
on the thinking process of the dog." 
</P>
<P>
Still a thrill a minute with his erratic control, Mitch Williams has filled a 
major void for the Chicago Cubs, converting 12 of 15 save opportunities, only 
one shy of Goose Gossage's club leading total of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the National League East leaders have no regrets about the 
seven-player deal in which Rafael Palmiero went to the Texas Rangers for 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll trade zero game-winning RBIs (Palmeiro's total of last year) for 12 saves 
at this point anytime," Chicago pitching coach Dick Pohl said. "Rafael was 
cute. The female fans were upset with the trade because he was cute, but cute 
doesn't win games." 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Moyer, who went from the Cubs to the Rangers in the same deal and was 3-0 
with a 2.82 ERA in April, is 0-4 with a 6.85 ERA in five May starts and will 
try again Monday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Those same Detroit Tigers who drove Sparky Anderson to his Thousand Oaks home 
on the brink of exhaustion are 6-1 under interim manager Dick Tracewski, who 
has an 11-2 career record replacing Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between coaching and managing, as it pertains to the media? 
</P>
<P>
"I used to say hello to everyone and they'd never answer," Tracewski said. "Now 
they want to know what color underwear I'm wearing." 
</P>
<P>
In quest of a successor to fired manager Jimy Williams, the Toronto Blue Jays 
have now interviewed Bob Bailor, manager of their Syracuse farm club; Terry 
Bevington, the White Sox first-base coach, and Lou Piniella, the former New 
York Yankee manager who now does color commentary on the Yankee cable 
telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella is the front-runner, but Yankee owner George Steinbrenner will 
reportedly demand player compensation in return for letting Piniella out of his 
contract, and during this week's series with the Angels he ordered Piniella 
onto the field to work with Yankee hitters during batting practice in what 
seemed to be a blatant attempt to show that Piniella's value to the Yankees 
extends beyond the broadcasting booth, beefing up his compensation demands. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate result was an awkward situation in which Piniella, in street 
clothes, stood on one side of the cage and hitting instructor Frank Howard, in 
uniform, stood on the other, with the players caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, asked about his interview by six members of the Toronto front 
office, Bailorsaid: 
</P>
<P>
"You ever see one of those Iran-Contra hearings? I felt like Oliver North. 
Every once in awhile they'd ask me a question like 'would you go fishing with 
one of your players?' 
</P>
<P>
"I think I answered, 'yes, but not all the time. It would depend on if 
something good came out of it. It would depend on who was paying for the boat 
and who was buying the beer.' " 
</P>
<P>
Offering a solution to the Blue Jay managerial situation, pitcher Mike Flanagan 
said Cito Gaston "should sign a three year deal as the interim manager. That 
would solve everything. When you get right down to it, they're all interim 
managers anyway."
