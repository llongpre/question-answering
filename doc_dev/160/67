Harold Reynolds was the first Seattle Mariner to bat against Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
On May 21, he stood behind Langston at second base in a game against New York, 
a teammate in Langston's final game as a Mariner. 
</P>
<P>
He was no teammate Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw that first pitch, it was probably the hardest ball I've ever seen in 
my life from a left-hander," Reynolds said. "The next one was even harder. You 
don't see that when you're playing behind a guy." 
</P>
<P>
Langston began his career as an Angel by throwing four consecutive balls to 
Reynolds, sending him to first. It did not seem a debut to merit $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
Then he didn't allow a hit over seven innings, combining with Mike Witt on a 
no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw the ball good, good stuff, that was evident," Reynolds said. "It felt 
like once they started giving him the high strike he was hard to hit. He 
pitched a great game. I knew once he settled down he'd be all right." 
</P>
<P>
It was different from playing behind Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"You play behind a guy, you don't face him," Reynolds said. "The only advantage 
I felt I had was on the bases. I knew his moves. He was on. He pitched a great 
game. He's one of the best. He's the best left-hander I've ever faced." 
</P>
<P>
They were friends and teammates, but there was no joy in the Mariner clubhouse 
after the 1-0 loss to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible, Reynolds was asked, to be happy for Langston? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. "He pitched a great game. That's good for him. I wish we'd worn 
him out, actually . . . I don't think he's worried about how we feel about it. 
We'll get him again." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre was wearing a stern face. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark threw good," he said. "He had a good hard slider. . . . When he needed to 
get the out, he got it. . . . On the whole, the only thing I feel upset about, 
not upset, disappointed, is we had great pitching ourselves. Good pitching on 
both sides. Unfortunately, it would have taken a no-hitter to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Only the Angels had one. 
</P>
<P>
"He was on," Reynolds said. "What can I say? We knew he would be." 
</P>
<P>
They knew he would be on, but that didn't make it easier. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw a no-hitter, man," Lefebvre said. "I don't give a . . . if he's 
throwing power or not. Even a no-hitter isn't hard to swallow. Losing 1-0 is 
hard to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing they could do.
