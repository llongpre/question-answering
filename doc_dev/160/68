   A 36-year-old white man accused of
lobbing a hand grenade into a crowd of blacks during a racial melee
could be charged with as many as nine counts of attempted murder,
police said.
   The brawl between club-wielding whites and rock- and
bottle-throwing blacks capped long-simmering tensions in a racially
mixed community, residents said.
   Wayne T. Langston was arrested Monday and charged with two
counts of attempted murder and with throwing an explosive device,
Manatee Sheriff Charlie Wells said.
   Langston was held in the Manatee County jail with bail set at
$150,000.
   There were no critical injuries from the blast, authorities
said. Seven people were treated for shrapnel wounds and two others
suffered minor injuries, Wells said..
   ``We possibly will be charging him with as many as nine counts
of attempted murder,'' said Wells, who described the grenade attack
was ``an isolated racial incident.''
   But residents of the neighborhood, called ``Duplex City,'' said
racial tensions have run high since the opening three months ago of
the Midway Bar, which they said is frequented by ``rednecks'' and
members of a motorcycle gang.
   It was not known whether Langston, who worked at the pub, was a
member of a motorcycle gang, Wells said.
   The fight broke out Sunday evening between about 15 blacks in
the parking lot of a convenience store and about 35 patrons of the
adjacent bar, police said.
   Whites yelled racial slurs as the confrontation grew heated,
according to witness Lynn Butler, 19. He said he saw a white man
emerge from the area of the bar and lob the grenade.
   ``He just popped the clip. He just threw it. Then in five
seconds there was a boom!'' Butler said, adding that everyone in
the parking lot scrambled for cover.
   The explosion caused about $30,000 damage to the cars and
shattered windows of surrounding businesses. ``It looked like
guerilla warfare,'' Butler said.
   Langston was arrested on warrants issued after witnesses and
acquaintances talked to police, Wells said. Police reports show
Langston has been charged twice since 1981 for aggravated battery
but never convicted.
