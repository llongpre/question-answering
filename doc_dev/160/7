The Blue Jays, held hitless for eight innings by Seattle's Mark Langston, 
rallied for three runs in the ninth today and beat the Mariners 3-2, with 
George Bell driving in the winning run with a bloop single off reliever Mike 
Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
Langston had shackled the Blue Jays through the first eight innings, allowing 
only one baserunner, on shortstop Omar Vizquel's error in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
But in the ninth, Langston unraveled quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lawless, pinch-hitting for Lloyd Moseby, led off the inning with a solid 
single to center, ending Langston's chance to become the first Seattle pitcher 
to hurl a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
After Nelson Liriano sacrificed Lawless to second, Bob Brenly, batting for Rob 
Ducey, doubled down the left field line, scoring Lawless and ending Langston's 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Felix then tied the score 2-2 with an RBI single to center, driving in 
pinch-runner Alexis Infante. Felix went to second on the throw to the plate, 
and Langston was replaced by Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
Schooler retired Kelly Gruber on a grounder to third and intentionally walked 
Tony Fernandez to pitch to the slumping Bell.
