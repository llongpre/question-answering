If he was tired, it was born of frustration, not fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader was tired of seeing his team unable to muster much of an offense, 
and he wouldn't accept the obvious excuse that the Angels might have been 
exhausted after a 13-game trip and unable to do better than five hits against 
the New York Yankees on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels been running on near-empty offensively all season, and their 5-2 
loss to the Yankees emphasized how low their fuel level is. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't accept (fatigue). If you're tired, you suck it up," Rader said after 
the Angels' sixth loss in their last nine games and 11th in their last 16. "You 
have no right to be fatigued. Possibly mentally fatigued, but physically 
fatigued, not these people here. I doubt that very few of these people here 
have been physically fatigued. Sometimes you might think you are, but you never 
are." 
</P>
<P>
They had to be tired of having little to show for their at-bats against Dave 
LaPoint (2-2), who last Sunday lasted only two innings against the Angels, 
giving up four runs (one earned). 
</P>
<P>
This time, after Luis Polonia tripled to lead off the first inning and scored 
on Devon White's sacrifice fly, the Angels had only two more hits off LaPoint 
in five innings and only one more run against the Yankees, who had lost their 
previous five games. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody did what Luis Polonia did," Rader said, "we would have scored 
nine runs and won." 
</P>
<P>
They scored one more, when Chili Davis walked and Dante Bichette doubled in the 
ninth off Dave Righetti, the fourth New York pitcher. By then, they had 
squandered a bases-loaded, two-out chance in the fourth, leaving them one for 
10 in bases-loaded situations this season, and the Yankees had benefited from 
Jesse Barfield's three-run home run in the sixth off Mark Langston (2-2), who 
had earned the victory in that game against the Yankees last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same old David," said Rader, who was a coach with the Chicago White 
Sox when LaPoint pitched there. "He changes speeds, turns the ball over and 
sinks it. He gives you the opportunity to get yourself out and that's exactly 
what we did for him." 
</P>
<P>
LaPoint was grateful that the Angels accepted his invitation and continually 
were retired on groundouts this time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was different last week because I had a passed ball (which set up a 
three-run Angel rally in the second inning) and I instantly went and tried to 
make too perfect pitches and they were taking them," LaPoint said. "This time, 
I relaxed and threw my pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug knows me. He's seen my stuff. He knows if he's got a chance to bury me, 
he has to. My job is to just keep the game close." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who went eight innings, was bent on the same mission but could not 
accomplish it. The two second-inning walks he issued were an indication that he 
was in for some problems, and he gave up a run in the third on a walk, a stolen 
base and a run-scoring single by Don Mattingly, one of the few left-handed 
hitters who owns a good (.289) career average against him. 
</P>
<P>
"If you flirt with danger as much as he was, one bad pitch is going to happen," 
Rader said. "That's not to belittle him, but when you're that wild and not able 
to control your pitches any better than that, problems are almost inevitable. 
You can't avoid danger if you put yourself in that position over and over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees chipped away for another run in the fifth, using a walk, a stolen 
base and a run-scoring single by Roberto Kelly. Then they pulled away in the 
sixth. With one out, Langston hit Steve Balboni and then gave up a single to 
Dave Winfield. Barfield's home run to right-center came on a fastball down and 
away, and it left the Angels too far down to recover. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't getting my fastball over and that's the big key for me," said 
Langston, who had not given up more than four earned runs in any of his 
previous four starts this season. "I felt pretty lucky, considering how wild I 
was in the first couple innings. I never really got into a groove until after 
the damage was done and then I settled down and got ahead of the hitters. It 
was too late by then. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt rested. That wasn't the problem. It was location." 
</P>
<P>
He might have been assuming too much blame. Given the Angels' .233 team 
average, they are not likely to overcome many deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Or build many leads.

Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Jackson, now a TV commentator on Channel 5, gave Yankee outfielder Dave 
Winfield a hard time while the Yankees were doing their pregame stretching. "So 
you're a part-timer now," Jackson began, as Winfield, who missed the 1989 
season after undergoing back surgery, did his calisthenics. "You know what 
happens when they make you the DH. That's how they ran me out of baseball. . . 
. Don't leave anything on the warning track tonight because you know what 
people are going to say. They're going to say, 'Years ago, that would have gone 
out.' " The other Yankees smiled, giving Jackson more fuel. "The guys that are 
laughing the hardest are thinking the same thing," Jackson said. "Oh, and you 
know I need you for an interview?" Jackson's jesting may have inspired 
Winfield. He ended a career-worst 0-for-23 streak in the fourth with a single.

To the delight of Angel newcomer Luis Polonia, Donnie Hill gave Polonia uniform 
No. 22 -- which means Polonia can keep the ornate gold "22" charm he wears 
around his neck instead of selling it to Hill. "I figured I'd have to change my 
whole wardrobe if he gave it to me," said Hill, who took 18. Polonia was even 
more delighted to be in the starting lineup Friday against a left-hander. "It's 
great. That's telling me I don't have to think about whether I'm playing or 
not," he said. "That was the tough thing for me -- I'd be home and then come to 
the game and see I'm not in the lineup. Now I don't have to think about it or 
read the paper to see who's pitching. I'm going to be there and I'm going to do 
my job day by day."
