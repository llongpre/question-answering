<LEADPARA>  The votes are in, and you, the readers, gave Giants center fielder Willie
McGee a vote of confidence.;    When we asked you to vote for the real major
league All-Star teams, you responded by electing McGee to the National
League's starting lineup.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Unfortunately for McGee, he wasn't even selected as a reserve to the team
that will play in Toronto on Tuesday night.;    But, readers, take heart. Your
All-Star picks are to be commended. In fact, your choices at several positions
are obviously better than those resulting from the fans' ballots.;    For
instance, can you believe the fans elected . . .;    (check) A's first baseman
Mark McGwire (.201 batting average) over Detroit's Cecil Fielder (21 home
runs, 65 RBIs)?;    (check) Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar (.219) over the A's
Terry Steinbach (.285)?;    (check) Toronto second baseman Roberto Alomar
(.284) over Texas' Julio Franco (.318)?;    (check) Seattle outfielder Ken
Griffey Jr. (.273) instead of Texas' Ruben Sierra (.326)?;    Look, we know
you have nothing against the Alomars; you just knew that Steinbach and Franco
were having better seasons than they were. And if the fans were going to
overlook Sierra, they may as well have voted in Ken Griffey Sr.;    We also
liked your choice of Pittsburgh's Bobby Bonilla over Cincinnati's Chris Sabo
as the National League third baseman. And the fans clearly blew it when they
voted in Los Angeles outfielder Darryl Strawberry.;    But we do have a
question for you, the readers:;    How the heck could you leave Andre Dawson
out of your lineup?;    And just when you thought it was safe to put all this
All-Star controversy to rest, here's the way our staff experts picked 'em:;
