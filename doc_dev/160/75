<LEADPARA>  The Hendersons are back.;    Rickey's celebrated return from the disabled list
was uneventful; he was hitless and didn't get to test the stolen-base record,
but his injured left calf muscle held up in the outfield and the batter's box.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  RICKEY'S BACK, BUT DAVE (.406) TOPS HENDERSON
ACT
NOT SO HOT? HOW ABOUT A 4-FOR-4 PERFORMANCE?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Dave's "absence" -- by his declaration only -- ended with a 4-for-4
afternoon that raised his batting average to .406 and helped the A's defeat
the California Angels 4-3 Saturday, along with Terry Steinbach's three RBIs
and Mike Moore's third victory.;    Yet, Dave Henderson, 0-for-his-last-11
entering the game, declared, "I'm not hot any more, by the way.";    Oh?;   
"Hot is when you can walk up at any time and get a hit," he explained. "Right
now, I'm like anyone else up there, struggling to get a hit.";    Hot, by
anyone else's definition, would be getting three hits on a cracked bat, as he
did, or getting his ninth hit in 10 at-bats when next-door neighbor Mark
Langston is the starting pitcher, as he did.;    Henderson has a home next
door to Langston's on a cul de sac in Seattle, a house that Langston helped
pick out. They live about 30 feet from each other, Henderson said.;    "Not 60
feet, 6 inches, but close enough," he cracked.;    Langston, otherwise strong
over eight innings, might need to throw to Henderson from 30 feet to get him
out these days. The last time Langston started against the A's, Henderson went
5 for 6 with two doubles, a home run and five RBIs. This time, he had four
singles.;    Henderson cracked the beloved bat that he has been using since
spring training in his second at-bat against Langston. The crack started near
the handle and crept toward the barrel, yet Henderson used it the entire
game.;    "I figured, it's been good to me," he said. "It just went down for
the last time. We'll have a burial tomorrow.";    Henderson has two World
Series bats "with a couple of knocks in them," he said, to replace his old
bat.;    The "other" Henderson -- in this case, Rickey, the 1990 American
League MVP -- made news merely by his presence. He had left open the
possibility that he might not be ready to play Saturday, but he said he felt
fine other than some soreness in his left knee from recent conditioning.;   
Rickey said he was more concerned about hitting -- because of the powerful
stride he takes with his left leg and the driving first step coming out of the
batter's box -- than he was playing in the field or getting an opportunity to
steal. He needs two steals to break Lou Brock's record.;    He also admitted
battling nerves.;    "It seemed like it was opening day for me," he said. "And
I was nervous about reinjuring the leg.";     HOW THEY SCORED;    Angels 1st
