   During 42 months of captivity, Frank Reed endured
the psychological pain of being told his mother had died and the
physical pain of being badly beaten when he tried to escape, his
daughter said.
   It was only after he was released Monday that Reed learned his
mother was still alive, his daughter, Marilyn Langston, said
Thursday. The wounds from his beating still ache, she said.
   Reed, 57, was scheduled to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base
today and spend a few more days undergoing tests at a military
hospital before continuing home to Massachusetts, a U.S. State
Department spokeswoman said.
   In a telephone conversation early Wednesday, Reed said his
Islamic captors told him his mother, 91-year-old Leota Sprague, had
died, Langston said said.
   ``He was told she had passed away,'' Langston said in a
telephone interview from her home in Malden. ``He didn't know she
was alive until he was released. We were able to tell him she was
very much alive.''
   Reed's mother shares an apartment in Malden with Reed's wife,
Fahima, and the couple's 9-year-old son, Tarek.
   Langston said she would fly to Washington today to meet her
father.
   In a telephone call early Wednesday, Reed told Langston he had
tried to escape his captors but was quickly caught and badly beaten
for the attempt.
   ``He told me he'd been beaten. He did try to escape and they'd
beaten him very badly,'' Langston said.
   On Wednesday evening, Langston tied a yellow ribbon around a
tree in front of her home. On the house she hung a large banner
reading, ``Free at last, Frank Reed, April 30, 1990.''
   She said Reed was denied medical attention for his wounds and is
still recovering from them. Reed said he had tried to escape alone,
but it was unclear when during his captivity he had made the
attempt, she said.
   Langston said she had previously heard of the beating in news
reports from the French hostages who had been released in 1988.
   Reed expressed concern about what he would do following his
return to the United States, she said.
   ``He's concerned about what will happen now,'' she said. ``He
feels his school is gone, and he's wondering about the future.''
   The founder of a private school in Beirut, Reed was abducted on
Sept. 9, 1986 and spent 3{ years in captivity.
   He was the second American hostage to be freed in nine days.
Robert Polhill, freed April 22, went through the same battery of
medical tests and questioning last week that Reed is currently
undergoing.
   In his first public statement since his release Monday, Reed
told reporters outside a military hospital in West Germany that he
had believed he was the last hostage to be released and he was
angry that other Americans are still being held.
   Reed, a native of Malden, said he spent several years in
captivity with hostages Terry Anderson, Thomas Sutherland, John
McCarthy and Brian Keenan.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted on a Beirut street in March 1985. He is the
longest-held hostage.
