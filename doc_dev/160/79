<LEADPARA>  There have been six combined no-hitters of at least nine innings in major
league history, and the A's or Orioles have been involved in four of them. The
1975 A's were the only previous team to use four pitchers in achieving the
feat.;  Date           Team Pitchers,      Inn. Opp.  Result; May 26, 1956

    Gregg Olson, 1; x -- Milwaukee's Jack Ditmer doubled with two out in the
10th inning, and Black lost on three hits in 11 innings.; ...; BYE-BYE, BABE;
For reasons known only to the folks who put together the baseball record
books, the list of shared no-hitters does not include perhaps one of the
game's strangest no-nos. Although two pitchers worked for the Boston Red Sox
in their no-hitter against the Washington Senators on June 23, 1917, the game
is not considered a combined no-hitter but is considered a perfect game for
one of the two.;       Seems the Boston starter was so ticked off at umpire
Brick Owens about a walk to leadoff batter Ray Morgan that he got himself
tossed from the game. Ernie Shore relieved, Morgan was caught stealing, the
next 26 batters went down in order, and Shore was credited with the perfecto
and the starter with nothing.;       And within a couple of years, that
starter was through as a pitcher in baseball, though he did go on to a measure
of success as an outfielder. Name of Babe Ruth.; ...; ORIOLES NO-NOS; After
having no-hitters in three consecutive seasons from 1967 to '69, it took
Baltimore 22 years to record the next.   In all, there have been five Orioles
no-hitters, since the team once known as the Browns left St. Louis for
Baltimore after the 1953 season.; Date            Pitcher(s)              Opp.

Bob Milacki's previous no-hit experience as a professional also had a strange
twist. On May 28, 1987, Milacki set a Southern League record by pitching 11
1/3 hitless innings for Double-A Charlotte against Chattanooga, and eventually
pitched 13 innings of one-hit ball in a victory.; ...; SO WHY ALL THE FUSS?;
Remember when no-hitters used to be rare? There have now been 12 in the majors
the past two seasons. A.L. West teams have been involved in eight of them. The
Phillies and Rangers each have two, and the A's and Blue Jays each have been
victims twice (so have the Yankees, if you consider they lost Andy Hawkins').
Just in case you've long ago lost track, here's the list:; Date

losing end of a no-hitter is nothing new to the A's. In the 24 seasons they've
been in Oakland, there have been seven pitched against them. The strange thing
is that five of the seven have been in the month of July.;           Pitcher
