Larry Horne could hardly contain his excitement at last winter's Berlin Gay and 
Lesbian Film Festival when he saw "Looking for Langston," director Isaac 
Julien's study of homosexuality during the Harlem Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
"I considered it the first black gay feature film ever made," said Horne, the 
director and founder of the seventh Los Angeles International Gay and Lesbian 
Film and Video Festival, which runs through Sunday at the Directors Guild of 
America Theater in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Horne, who has shown all of the London-based Julien's previous films, had 
decided to open the festival with "Looking for Langston," which deals with 
intimate bonds between gay blacks and whites. Langston Hughes' poetry is 
presented as a voice-over in parts of the movie. The black poet died in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"It would set the tone," Horne proclaimed, "of a festival that was shaped along 
the themes of multi-culturalism." 
</P>
<P>
But Horne's dream recently fell apart when Ada Griffin, director of the New 
York-based Third World Newsreel, the distributor of "Langston," called and 
demanded that he not show the film. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes estate sent a cease-and-desist letter to Julien in mid-June 
informing him that he would put Griffin, Horne's festival and himself in legal 
jeopardy if the film were screened. 
</P>
<P>
The cause for the crisis? Julien had secured the rights to quote Hughes' poetry 
in the film, but only for use in Britain. ("Langston" already has been shown on 
"Out on Tuesday," a gay series on Britain's Channel 4.) 
</P>
<P>
But according to Griffin, film maker Julien apparently wasn't aware of the 
resistance he would meet from the "black bourgeoisie" who, she feels, "see 
Hughes as a racial icon." 
</P>
<P>
"They (the estate) were appalled at any inference that Hughes might have been a 
homosexual and they wanted all mentions of him out," said Griffin from her New 
York office. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' sexuality has long been debated among academics. Lately, an acclaimed 
biography of Hughes' life by Arnold Rampersad, published by Oxford University 
Press, was unable to confirm that Hughes was homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
However, the editors of "Gay and Lesbian Poetry of Our Time," published by St. 
Martin's Press, included four poems by Hughes in their anthology. 
</P>
<P>
Why the fuss then about "Langston"? 
</P>
<P>
According to Horne, "the power of celluloid is formidable, even if we're 
talking independent art films -- which is why I wanted to program this festival 
along multicultural themes." 
</P>
<P>
For Horne's part, "the absence of 'Langston' doesn't necessarily detract from 
the festival." Rather, he says that "the mess" points out how "much we still 
need gay and lesbian film festivals." 
</P>
<P>
Julien, who was contacted at his London production company, SanKoFa, seemed to 
take the pulling of the film from the festival in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hughes estate had four major points of contention: that we delete all of 
Hughes' poetry, all mention of the estate in the credits of the film and all 
excerpts of Hughes reading his poetry on NBC television, as well as pay for the 
estate's legal expenses in suing us. 
</P>
<P>
"We will delete the poetry," Julien said. "I want the film to get shown -- and 
the film isn't so much about Hughes as it's about 'looking' for cultural pride. 
</P>
<P>
"But I will not comply with deleting the NBC footage because that is part of 
the public domain. And even though we are trying our best to act in good faith 
with the estate, we will not go so far as to pay for their expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Harold Ober Associates, an agency that represents the Hughes 
estate, refused to comment on the legal or social implications of their 
cease-and-desist letter when questioned by The Times.
