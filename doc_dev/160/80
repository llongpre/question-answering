Angels Stadium was witness to another massive home run by the Angels' massive 
rookie outfielder, Dante Bichette, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
This one, Bichette's second in as many days, was a fourth-inning grand slam off 
the Seattle Mariners' Mark Langston, a feat that brought the right-field 
bleacherites to their feet for a simple but rousing chorus as Bichette trotted 
out to his position in the top of the fifth: 
</P>
<P>
"Dante's Gonna Stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad baseball rosters aren't assembled by popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
By Angel Manager Doug Rader's admission, Bichette has done everything he has 
had to do this spring. Hit for average? Bichette is batting .349. Hit for 
power? His four home runs lead the Angels. Drive in runs? Bichette and Devon 
White share the club lead in that department with 13 runs batted in apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette is even fielding, which had been a major blemish on his scouting 
report. In the sixth inning Saturday, Bichette raced back to the wall to pick 
off, backhanded, a drive by Greg Briley, turning a potential double into a long 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
All this . . . and it still might not be enough to earn him a roster spot on 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Rader about Bichette's bid to break into the Angels' congested outfield 
alignment and he'll respond with a mock grimace. "Why do you got to bring that 
up?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
Selecting an outfield was supposed to have been the least of Rader's worries. 
White, Chili Davis and Claudell Washington were going to play every day. Tony 
Armas, who hit 13 home runs as a reserve in 1988, was going to back them up. A 
done deal. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette, coming into camp with the one-year-away tag, has cramped Rader's 
style, no doubt, but the manager continues to hold to his original line of 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much against players going into spring training and making the club 
out of the blue," Rader said. "Spring training is a very difficult place to 
accurately appraise talent. The mistakes you can make outweigh the correct 
guesses, 110-1. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . When you look at what (Bichette) did at triple-A last year, there 
certainly was no indication that he could have a spring like this. It's like 
he's gone from a prospect to a can't-miss prospect overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear he's not out of the picture. But based on what he did 
at Edmonton last year, he still needs to have a solid year there." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, at age 24, Bichette batted .267 with 14 home runs and 81 RBIs in 132 
games. "And that's in a hitter's league," Rader noted. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette, not surprisingly, is not particularly keen on spending another summer 
north of border and south of the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a big disappointment, going back to Edmonton," Bichette said. 
"That would mean I'd been at Edmonton three years in a row. It would seem like 
I'm going nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette said he would take Anaheim any day, even if it means sitting on the 
bench most days. "I've looked at both sides of it and being in the big leagues 
outweighs playing every day in Edmonton." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels evened their record at 8-8 with a 7-6 victory over Seattle. The 
Angels totaled 10 hits, including Dante Bichette's grand slam and a two-run 
home run by Devon White. White went two-for-four to raise his batting average 
to .465. "He's going to be tired when this year's over," Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said, "because I can't see playing anybody out there but him." . . . Tony 
Armas intrepidly ventured out to first base for Round 2, after committing two 
errors in one play during Round 1. Armas' Saturday line: no errors, two slick 
plays, including a diving stop of a sharp grounder by Harold Reynolds. . . . 
Seattle pitcher Mark Langston was forced out of the game after taking a Dick 
Schofield line drive off his right ankle. Preliminary X-rays showed no fracture 
and Langston limped away with a bad bruise.
