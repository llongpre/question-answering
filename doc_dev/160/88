   A school janitor on Friday denied he tried to
electrocute his boss because of a poor work evaluation.
   Richard Dale Langston pleaded innocent to a charge of attempted
murder and was returned to jail under $150,000 bond. A pre-trial
hearing was scheduled for Nov. 5.
   Langston, 26, of Lynwood, was arrested Oct. 12 after boarding a
jet at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport with a one-way ticket
to Hawaii.
   Prosecutors allege that Langston wired a chain link fence at
Kellogg Middle School in Seattle in an attempt to electrocute his
supervisor, Jeffrey Minnix.
   When Minnix touched the fence the morning of Oct. 9, showers of
sparks and smoke went off, said Dan Donohoe, a King County
prosecutor's office spokesman.
   Minnix was saved from serious injury because he still wore his
insulated motorcycle gloves, said Donohoe.
   A bare wire had been connected to the fence and plugged into a
portable school building, he said.
