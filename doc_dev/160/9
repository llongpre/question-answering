In a bold move sure to send the skyrocketing price of baseball free agents even 
higher, the Angels today signed Mark Langston to a five-year contract worth $16 
million, making the 29-year-old left-hander the game's highest paid player.

Langston, who had a combined 16-14 record with the Mariners and Expos last 
season, got the longest contract awarded a player since the mid-1980s. Only 
Tuesday, Rickey Henderson broke the $3-million contract barrier when he 
re-signed with the World Champion Oakland A's for $12 million over four years. 
That was the first contract of that length since October, 1985, when Ken 
Oberkfell signed a four-year, $3-million agreement with the Atlanta Braves.

This off-season, which promises to be the busiest free-agent market ever, has 
seen Bryn Smith leave Montreal to sign a $6-million, three-year deal with the 
St. Louis Cardinals, Kirby Puckett re-sign with the Minnesota Twins for $9 
million over three years and Pascual Perez sign with the New York Yankees for 
$5.7 million for three years.

Langston, a native of San Diego, had held discussions with the Dodgers and 
Yankees before signing with the already pitching-rich Angels. The staff last 
season had a collective earned-run average of 3.28, second-best in the American 
League.
