   A new study indicates a drug called deprenyl
delays serious symptoms of Parkinson's disease and allows patients
to work and function twice as long as people not taking it.
   In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science, Dr. J.
William Langston of the California Parkinson's Foundation reported
that patients with early symptoms of Parkinson's who were treated
with deprenyl postponed progression of the neurological disease for
an average of almost eight months.
   ``It seemed to slow the rate (of symptom progression) by about
half and doubled the time before they needed treatment,'' Langston
said in a telephone interview. If the findings are verified by
later studies, he said, ``it suggests that we are tapping into the
basic mechanism'' that causes Parkinson's.
   Parkinson's is a brain disease marked by a progressive loss of
brain cells. The symptoms include palsy, a shuffling gait, a fixed
expression with unblinking eyes and, sometimes, emotional
instability. It affects about one person in 50, and strikes
patients most frequently in their 50s and 60s.
   The cause of the disease, which affects about 500,000 Americans,
is unknown and it is not curable.
   Progression of Parkinson's can be slowed with a drug called
levodopa, or L-dopa, but this drug can have serious side effects
and it loses its effectiveness over time.
   Langston said his study was conducted to determine if deprenyl
could slow the progress of the disease and thus give patients more
time before they were forced to start taking L-dopa.
   The study involved 54 patients, all of whom were evaluated by
tests to be at approximately the same early stage of Parkinson's.
Half of the patients were treated with deprenyl and half with a
placebo, or sugar pill.
   On average, those patients receiving the placebo required L-dopa
therapy within 312 days. But those taking deprenyl did not require
L-dopa for an average of 548 days.
   This means, said Langston, that serious symptoms of the disease
_ as evaluated by five different assessment methods _ were delayed
for more than 33 weeks on average.
   ``Overall, there was about a 50 percent decline in the rate of
progression,'' said the researcher. He said this translates into
maintaining a quality of life that could allow patients to work and
function longer.
   Dr. Erwin Montgomery, a professor of neurology at Washington
University in St. Louis who treats Parkinson's patients, said the
study is ``of very major significance.''
   ``Reducing the onset of symptoms has a tremendous effect,'' he
said. ``This translates into people being employed longer. This can
have a great importance in their lives.''
   The precise effect of deprenyl on brain tissue cannot be
determined without an autopsy, Langston said, but if later studies
show that the drug can actually protect brain cells that usually
die in Parkinson's then the findings may be a step toward finding a
cure.
   ``If we have altered the course of cell death in Parkinson's and
slowed it down, it suggests that we are tapping into the basic
mechanism that is causing those cells to die,'' said Langston.
``That's a very exciting clue of the possible cause.''
   Deprenyl, manufactured by Bolar Pharmaceuticals Co. of Copiague,
N.Y., is approved for use with L-dopa, but Langston said he used
the drug alone as a clinical trail approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. The drug will be sold starting in September under
the brand name Eldepryl.
   Langston's co-author in the study was Dr. James W. Tetrud, also
of the California Parkinson's Foundation. Science, which published
the study, is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
