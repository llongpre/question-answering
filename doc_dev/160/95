<LEADPARA>  DAVE STEWART scoffs now when anyone dares to consider those Stewart-Roger
Clemens duels as classic confrontations.;    "There isn't a rivalry between me
and Clemens anymore. You know that," Stewart said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He has a point. In this corner is Stewart, 7-0 against Clemens since he
joined the A's, 7-1 lifetime. Stewart also won a game after Clemens departed
last season. Undisputed champion.;    The guy who really took Stewart 15
rounds -- well, 10, anyway -- last season was up-and-coming Seattle Mariners
right-hander Erik Hanson. And this afternoon, we get the rematch of one of the
better-pitched games in years.;    Hanson was brilliant last Aug. 1, striking
out 11 and limiting the A's to two hits through 10 innings. But Stewart,
determined not to bow under, outlasted him and went 11 innings for the first
time in his career to claim the 1-0 victory.;    Afterward, even plate umpire
Rich Garcia raved about Hanson. Garcia's face lit up last week as he talked
about the game.;    "I said I worked Len Barker's perfect game and this guy
had better stuff that day than Len Barker had, and Len Barker had some great
stuff that day. He (Hanson) was excellent," Garcia said. "It was probably the
best-pitched game I've ever seen. . . . I loved that game. I enjoyed that
game.";    Rarely will you hear Stewart concede anything to an opponent, but
he says, "To be honest, if you look at just plain and simple who pitched the
best for 10 innings, he outpitched me. I just got out of trouble more than he
did. He wasn't in much trouble.";    But Garcia says Stewart deserved more
credit than he received.;    "It's really unfortunate that Hanson got a lot of
the credit. . . . He got a lot of the credit because he was young and I
shouldn't say because it was unexpected, but you expect that from Dave every
time he goes out there," Garcia said. "A guy like Dave is almost taken for
granted.";    Stewart knows one thing: The kid wore him out.;    "I tell you
what, I'm not looking forward to having to go through 11 innings to win a
ballgame again, that's for darn sure," he said.;  YOU CAN CALL HIM 'Al': When
outfielder Albert Belle smacked 11 homers this spring, it was the most by an
Indians player since Rudy Regalado hit 11 in the spring of 1954. Of course,
it's hard to shake the defeatist mentality that exists in Cleveland.;   
Regalado is remembered as one of the all-time great spring-training fizzles in
club history. His spring prompted the Indians to insert him at third and move
Al Rosen to first. Rosen hurt his hand, and Regalado hit two homers in 65
games. He played briefly in '55 and '56 and never hit another major league
homer.;    Belle's spring was viewed with some suspicion. But hitting coach
Jose Morales came to the defense of Belle, known as Joey before he missed most
of last season being treated for alcoholism.;    "The fact he did it in spring
training is no big deal. Guys still have to throw the ball and you have to hit
it. There's a lot of guys with the same number of at-bats as Albert, but they
didn't do what he did," Morales said.;    Belle continues to answer his
critics. He hit a homer into the fountains at Kansas City on opening day, and
he opened the season 5 for 16 with a homer and three RBIs.;    "I had to
answer a lot of questions this spring, and I wanted to answer them fast,"
Belle said. "The pitchers aren't as sharp in spring training. They made a lot
of mistakes, and I'm a good mistake hitter.";  GUARDIAN ANGEL: Dave Parker, a
designated hitter and designated morale booster in the twilight years of his
career, was the first player out of the dugout to greet Mark Langston on
Thursday when he left the game with the bases loaded. Langston, the California
Angels' hard-luck pitcher in '90, had thrown six scoreless innings.;    "He
did a real good job. I wasn't here last year, but I know he had a very tough
year and that he held up very well," Parker said. "What you want to create is
an atmosphere that shows you care about each other. We're trying to create a
family atmosphere.";    The Angels' bullpen preserved the win for Langston,
who was touched by Parker's gesture.;    "He's a big influence on this team,
even though he hasn't been here that long. There's a real good feeling in this
clubhouse now," Langston said.;  NEWS FROM OUR WEST DESK: Bob Welch, 0-1 after
his complete-game loss to the Twins last week, completed only two of 35 starts
in going 27-6 and winning the Cy Young Award in 1990. . . . Rangers pitching
coach Tom House on his patchwork bullpen: "I call them the Motley Crew. I
don't mean that they're bad. There's a lot of talent there, but as a group,
they're different." . . . The Mariners emphasized situational hitting this
spring, then promptly opened the season 4 for 40 with runners in scoring
position. . . . Chicago White Sox left-hander Ken Patterson says he won't give
up his No. 34 for Bo Jackson, if Jackson actually ever requires a White Sox
uniform. When Jackson was introduced to the Chicago media on April 3, he had a
No. 8 jersey.;  NEWS FROM OUR EAST BUREAU: Something for Yankees fans to
remember during a long, long summer: The Yankees traded away the 1990 A.L. MVP
(Rickey Henderson), the 1990 N.L. Cy Young Award winner (Doug Drabek) and the
1990 World Series MVP (Jose Rijo). . . . The Indians continue to make it
evident they're unwilling to compete for big-dollar players. They released Ron
Kittle in an economy move and won't negotiate with Tom Candiotti and Brook
Jacoby, who'll be free agents after this season. The payroll is $18 million,
little more than half what the A's project, and 13 players on the 25-man
roster are making $200,000 or less.  </TEXT>
