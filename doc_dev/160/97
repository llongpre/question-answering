ABBOTT PITCHES COMPLETE GAME, BUT ANGELS COME UP SHORT, 3-2

Jim Abbott had the right idea in his last start, pitching a shutout against the 
Toronto Blue Jays to assure himself no worse than a tie. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old left-hander was only marginally less effective Wednesday 
against the Milwaukee Brewers, but the Angels' inconsistent offense gave him no 
margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to get too caught up in results," Abbott said after pitching his 
second consecutive complete game and third in four starts, only to wind up with 
a 3-2 loss at Anaheim Stadium. "Sure, I'd like to win. I'm real disappointed 
that we didn't. But for the most part, I've got to look upon this start as 
being positive. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Mark Langston. It's just not happening for him, and he's pitching 
great. He's not winning, but it doesn't mean he's 
</P>
<P>
any less of a pitcher. That's how I have to look at this. When you start 
punishing yourself for good games, that's when you get in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Maturity and mechanical adjustments have made Abbott a better pitcher than he 
was even a month or two ago, but his record hasn't reflected that because the 
Angels' offense hasn't provided much support. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott (6-8) pitched an outstanding game, except for a tenuous first inning 
complicated by a mixup in signs with catcher Ron Tingley that turned into a 
passed ball and set up Dave Parker's two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Deer muscled a 2-and-0 fastball into the seats in left-center field in the 
second inning -- "The only bad pitch he threw," according to Angel Manager Doug 
Rader -- to provide the Brewers' final run, and although Abbott allowed only 
four more hits, that run was decisive. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring eight runs Tuesday night for Kirk McCaskill, the Angels mustered 
only two for Abbott off Mark Knudson (7-4), the first on Johnny Ray's home run 
in the fifth and two singles and a sacrifice fly by Dave Winfield in the sixth. 
In Abbott's 19 starts, the Angels have been outscored, 99-72. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, who has yet to win consecutive games this season, struck out three and 
didn't allow a walk for the second consecutive start. Over his last four 
starts, he has allowed six earned runs in 34 1/3 innings for an earned-run 
average of 1.57. His overall ERA is 4.19, his lowest since the second game of 
the season. And his record remains below .500. So does the Angels', at 45-47. 
</P>
<P>
"We've squandered some good pitching," Winfield said. "We're unpredictable, 
that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
That's all they can be sure of. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched a great game," said Max Venable, whose hit-and-run single in the 
sixth inning moved Luis Polonia to third base and into position to score on 
Winfield's fly ball. "It seems (Langston) and Abbott, we don't score a lot of 
runs for them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not fair. There's not much justice. We've got to have a few more 
guys hitting and pull things together. We're not balanced offensively very 
well. The chemistry is not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
The delicate chemistry between pitcher and catcher went awry in the first 
inning when Tingley, who was recalled from triple-A Edmonton on Tuesday, gave 
Abbott the wrong sign on an 0-and-1 pitch to Parker, after singles by Robin 
Yount and Gary Sheffield. 
</P>
<P>
"The sequence I'd gone through, I thought I'd given the sign for a fastball 
inside and I didn't -- I gave the sign for a breaking ball," said Tingley, who 
last caught Abbott during a brief exhibition outing in Palm Springs. "I set up 
for a fastball and it got away from me. That killed us. It put runners on 
second and third. I was getting a little anxious behind the plate wanting to 
get out of a jam. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute I got out there (to the mound) I said, 'Hey, it's my fault. Now 
let's shut them down.' " 
</P>
<P>
Except for Parker's single and Deer's home run, Abbott did. "He was in such a 
good groove, I could have thrown down any (sign)," Tingley said. 
</P>
<P>
By then, though, the damage was done, and the Angels were incapable of doing 
much offensive damage of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to see what would have happened in the first inning if the 
passed ball had not occurred," Rader said. "It changed the way the whole inning 
was set up. . . . The inning would have been a lot different had that not taken 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott deflected the blame from Tingley and downplayed the impact of that play. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had the first inning back," he said. "Some things that happened might 
have been avoided. (Working with Tingley) went real well except the first 
inning, and that was my fault. There were some other things, too. That wasn't 
the key. There were different pitches that could have been made. I should have 
known that. I think Ron did a great job back there as soon as he got used to my 
pitching pattern, and that's to his credit because it's not always easy to pick 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott has found that victories aren't easy to pick up, either, but he is 
encouraged by his improvement. If that hasn't yet translated into improvement 
in his record, he intends to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to speak too prematurely," he said. "But I give a lot of credit 
to (pitching coach) Marcel Lachemann. Mechanically, a lot of things have come 
together and that's led to more consistency throwing the ball over the plate 
with all four pitches. Because of that, that's turned into quality starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just got to keep at it. This is not the end of the world. Maybe I'll win 
a few 9-8 games or 7-6 games and everybody will forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today will be a day off for the Angels, their first at home since April 16. 
Another day off scheduled during a home stand in May was wiped out by a makeup 
game in Seattle. Other days off have actually been travel days. . . . Manager 
Doug Rader held a workout on an off day during a trip in April but left today 
open. "They need to rest their minds," said Rader, who plans a morning round of 
golf, an afternoon at the beach and time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott's plans include playing golf. "Maybe you'd better not say that," he 
said, referring to General Manager Mike Port's recent ban on bringing golf 
clubs on the road. . . . Abbott's complete game was the Angels' third in four 
games. Only one was a victory -- Chuck Finley's 3-2 decision over Toronto 
Sunday. Mark Langston had a complete-game 3-1 loss to Milwaukee Monday. The 
Angels' staff has 10 complete games this season, three each by Langston and 
Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took the season series from Milwaukee, 7-5, for the second 
consecutive season. . . . Johnny Ray's home run in the fifth inning was the 
Angels' 18th against the Brewers this season, the most they have hit against a 
single club since they got 18 against the New York Yankees in 1988. . . . Chili 
Davis, who has a strained lower back, is receiving therapy, but Wally Joyner, 
who had a possible stress fracture in his right kneecap, is limited to 
upper-body work.
