   This man knows what justice on the job means. He has long
recognized that without equal economic opportunity and economic
rights, there can be no real political democracy.
   No real freedom.
   And, yes, this man is a man of history _ a mover and shaker in
the power struggles of freedom and tyranny _ of democracy and
autocracy.
   The poet Langston Hughes long ago said it for us all. And I
quote him now:
   
   A long time ago,
   An enslaved people heading toward freedom
   Made up a song:
   Keep your hand on the plow! Hold on!
   That plow plowed a new furrow
   Across the field of history
   Into that furrow the freedom seed was dropped
   From that seed a tree grew, is growing,
   Will ever grow.
   That tree is for everybody,
   For all America, for all the world.
   May its branches spread and its shelter grow
   Until all races and all peoples know its shade.
   Keep your hands on the plow! Hold on!
   
   Any American worker _ blue collar, gray collar, pink collar or
white collar _ who has been displaced or dispossessed of his or her
job, who has been subjugated to a master-slave relationship by
corporate arrogance and profits without production _ can identify
with Langston Hughes and freedom's plow.
   And it well may be today's unreported and untold story, but the
man I'm about to nominate has been telling it like it is.
   And I am inordinately proud and uniquely privileged to offer in
nomination for the office of president of the United States, Jesse
Louis Jackson.
