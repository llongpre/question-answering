<P>
Having used the annual June draft of high school and college players to help 
build their budding dynasty, the Oakland A's have a chance to reinforce it with 
seven of the first 66 choices in the three-day process that begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
And the A's seem to have the right formula. 
</P>
<P>
They have drafted and developed three of the last four winners of the American 
League's rookie of the year award -- Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire and Walt Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
Their seven early selections in this year's draft include five compensation 
picks for the loss of free agents Storm Davis, Dave Parker and Tony Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited," said Dick Bogard, A's scouting director. "We know we're going 
to get some good players. Our biggest need throughout the system is pitching, 
and that's what we'll try to address." 
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Expos have a shot at an even bigger jackpot with 10 of the first 
53 picks, the compensation for failing to sign their No. 1 selection of last 
year and losing Hubie Brooks, Mark Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez as 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos always have done well in the draft. All of their regulars, except 
shortstop Spike Owen, were drafted and developed in the Expo system. Montreal's 
problems surface when their players become eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gary Hughes, Montreal's scouting director: "We haven't had much success in 
attracting or keeping free agents. But if we build a successful organization, 
players will want to stay and players will want to come." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's No. 1 is pitcher Todd Van Poppel of Martin High in Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
But Van Poppel has said that he will attend the University of Texas rather than 
sign. Is that leverage? 
</P>
<P>
The Braves have the first pick and Paul Snyder, Atlanta's scouting director, is 
spending the weekend in Arlington, trying to convince Van Poppel that owner Ted 
Turner has a lot to offer. 
</P>
<P>
If Van Poppel convinces the Braves that he will not sign, the Expos, who draft 
11th, are expected to risk one of their top 10 picks on him, with the Braves 
making Iowa shortstop Tim Costo their No. 1 choice. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California players expected to go in the first round include 
outfielder Tony Clark of Christian High in El Cajon, who is also considering 
playing basketball at Arizona; first baseman Mark Newfield of Marina High in 
Huntington Beach; catcher Mike Lieberthal of Westlake High in Westlake Village; 
catcher Paul Ellis of UCLA; shortstop Aaron Holbert of Jordan High in Long 
Beach, and pitcher Kurt Miller of West High in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Two local players with familiar bloodlines could go in the second round or 
higher -- infielder Bret Boone of USC and outfielder Gary Mota of Fullerton 
Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Boone, who enhanced his status with an impressive display of power in NCAA 
regional play, is coveted by the Boston Red Sox, for whom his grandfather, 
former major leaguer Ray Boone, scouts. Mota is also being wooed by Arizona 
State and has yet to complete the three years of college that his dad, Manny 
Mota, demands of his sons. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, coming off what can be kindly called spotty performances in recent 
drafts, select ninth in the first round but do not hold a second- or 
third-round choice because of the signing of free agents Brooks and Jim Gott. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers do get two compensation picks between the second and third rounds 
after losing free agents John Tudor and Dave Anderson, and Scouting Director 
Ben Wade said he expects to find quality players. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who draft 24th, do not have a first-round selection because of 
Langston's signing, but they are not upset. After making Jim Abbott their No. 1 
in 1988 and Kyle Abbott their No. 1 in 1989, there is not another Abbott who 
fits their No. 1 mold anyway. 
</P>
<P>
There has been suspicion that the 1990 baseball contains the same juice as the 
1987 model, but, although home runs are up in both the American and National 
leagues over last year, the pace does not compare to '87, when the National 
produced a record 1,824 homers and the American had a record 2,634. 
</P>
<P>
The current American League pace projects to 2,165, the National to 1,531. 
</P>
<P>
Through 40 games for every team, the yardstick employed by the Elias Sports 
Bureau, there had been 378 homers hit in the National League, an increase of 83 
over a similar period in 1989 but 106 behind the '87 pace. 
</P>
<P>
In the American League, there had been 481 homers hit, an increase of 65 over 
last year but 165 fewer than the '87 pace. 
</P>
<P>
In analyzing the increase over last year, most cite the full-time availability 
of Jose Canseco and Andre Dawson, the emergence of Cecil Fielder, the lockout 
that left starting pitchers unprepared to sustain their stamina or throw 
breaking balls through April and a deterioration of quality pitching in the 
National League. 
</P>
<P>
Having surpassed Ty Cobb's American League stolen-base record with his 893rd 
steal Tuesday night, Oakland's Rickey Henderson is confident he will top Lou 
Brock's major league record of 938 sometime in August. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be remembered as an all-around player, but I know that the 
base-stealing will stand out," he said. "I expect to steal 1,200 to 1,500 
before I'm through." 
</P>
<P>
Fired manager Davey Johnson will get $850,000 in guaranteed salary from the New 
York Mets through 1991, but the decision could prove even more costly to the 
Mets if Darryl Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds make good on indications that 
they will now leave as free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, eligible to go after the 1990 season, said Johnson's firing "pretty 
much finalizes my decision." 
</P>
<P>
He and Johnson had a number of confrontations, but Strawberry said, "Even with 
all our disagreements, I love the man, I really do. He stood by me when it got 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds, eligible to leave after the 1991 season, said of the Mets' 
decision, "It stinks. I mean, I guess his history with the Mets doesn't matter 
to the geniuses in the front office." 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds may not have to think about moving far. Rumors persist that Johnson 
will ultimately replace Bucky Dent as manager of the cross-town Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
A headline in the New York Daily News the other day read: "Davey Preys While 
Bucky Prays." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledged Johnson: "I'd like to manage the Yankees. I don't want to put any 
pressure on Bucky, but I've learned to manage in the toughest market in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Yankees make it that much tougher, considering the involvement 
of owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Johnson wasn't sure who ran the Mets, calling General Manager Frank 
Cashen and Vice Presidents Joe McIlvaine and Al Harazin a three-headed monster. 
</P>
<P>
"At least with George you'd have some conversations," he said, pausing before 
adding, "maybe too many." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, meanwhile, continues to leave the door open concerning Dent. He 
told New York reporters in Chicago the other day that he considered Johnson "a 
wonderful guy" and asked, "If you were the owner of a team 14 games (10, 
actually) under .500, what would you do?" 
</P>
<P>
One thing seems certain. Unless the Yankees -- who on top of all else lack 
heart and guts, according to outfielder Mel Hall -- make a move in the 
standings during a 26-game stretch against Eastern Division opponents that 
began Friday, Dent will be out. Caught in the current crossfire, Dent's skin is 
thickening in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets aggravating and annoying to hear the same questions every day," he 
said. " 'Are you secure? Are you worried?' I don't even think about it. As I've 
said, by the time I leave I'll be an armadillo." 
</P>
<P>
The miseries continue to mount for the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outfielder Kevin Bass goes on the 21-day disabled list and will be 
sidelined two to three months because of knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher Rick Reuschel, 6-0 in May of last year and 0-5 in May of this year, 
twists a knee and joins two other starting pitchers, Kelly Downs and Mike 
LaCoss, on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another starter, Don Robinson, is activated after rehabilitating a 
surgically repaired knee, only to suffer back spasms that require a cortisone 
injection and leave him an indefinite starter today against the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kevin Mitchell, batting .375 on the road through Thursday but only .253 at 
home, where the Giants were 6-16 through Thursday, decides that the wind and 
dust at Candlestick Park are too tough on his contact lenses and will try 
glasses as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will Clark, with one hit in his last 22 at-bats through Thursday, ends a 
string of nine consecutive months in which he has hit .300 or better by batting 
.203 in May. 
</P>
<P>
The surprising success of his Minnesota Twins hasn't created any illusions for 
Manager Tom Kelly in a division dominated by the A's. 
</P>
<P>
What will it take for the Twins to win? 
</P>
<P>
"A miracle. That's all, a miracle," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Padres opened a 13-game home stand Thursday -- a make-or-break 
span, perhaps. The Padres won three in a row and five of their last six on the 
road after a team meeting prompted by Mike Pagliarulo's comments regarding the 
selfishness of a leading San Diego player. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo didn't identify the player but left no doubt that it was Tony Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
The situation festered, with Gwynn and Pagliarulo exchanging media potshots, 
until Manager Jack McKeon called the meeting. Gwynn reportedly exchanged views 
with several players who supported Pagliarulo. Pitcher Eric Show and catcher 
Benito Santiago were among others who drew teammates' fire for their attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there were some hurt feelings, and I know a lot of guys didn't like 
what was being said about them, but you don't have to be best friends to play 
good together on the field," Pagliarulo said. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, if guys don't like me for what I said, get in line. I'll be damned if 
I'm going to play for a mediocre team. I want to play on a winner, and I'm 
going to do everything I possibly can to make it a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack Clark: "There was a lot of bad stuff going on. When guys were 
stealing bases, for instance, we'd actually step out of the way to give the 
catcher a better chance of throwing the runner out. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're a team again. We've come a long way in the past week. I'm not saying 
everything's perfect yet. We're still going to have a few more meetings to get 
things ironed out, but this is a start." 
</P>
<P>
Some comments . . . 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Tom Grieve of the Texas Rangers on speculation that Manager 
Bobby Valentine is in trouble: "I don't believe in firing the manager when 
things go bad. That's a panic move, and I don't panic." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson on Bo Jackson's acceleration: "Yes, he 
can really excel." 
</P>
<P>
Recently retired pitcher Dan Quisenberry, on his decision to reject job offers 
that would have put him on the road again: "I want to see what it's like being 
married with children."
