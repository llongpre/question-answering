THE IDEA of a special autumn EC summit to discuss implementing the
Maastricht treaty received the backing yesterday of Mr Hans van den Broek,
European commissioner for external political relations.
Speaking in London, he said such a meeting would provide 'new and credible
impulses for carrying out and bringing forward the integration process'.
The proposal was made on Wednesday by six Christian Democrat leaders, headed
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The idea of calling a special summit to mark the
ratification of the Maastricht treaty fits in with the German chancellor's
desire to revive popular enthusiasm for the Community and give it 'a special
push ahead'.
One idea which could be explored is the possibility of bringing Austria,
Finland, Norway and Sweden into the Community before the end of 1995, as
currently planned.
A second theme would be to offer a better deal to eastern Europe countries
whose full EC membership is a much more distant prospect.
Yesterday, Mr van den Broek said he was optimistic that the regular
six-monthly EC summit to be held in Copenhagen later this month would
endorse Commission proposals for further liberalisation of trade with
central and eastern Europe.
The measures are due to be discussed by EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg
on Tuesday.
As for the suggested special summit, there is some doubt in Bonn whether it
should try to settle the thorny problem of siting new EC institutions, in
particular the European Monetary Institute. It would require tough
negotiations, particularly between Germany, which wants the EMI in
Frankfurt, and Britain, which would prefer any other site.
Such haggling would be out of keeping with an optimistic, smiling summit,
which is clearly what Mr Kohl wants.
Just when a summit could be called depends not only on the British
parliament, but also on the German constitutional court, which is
considering a series of legal challenges to ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
The court is expected to hold its oral hearing into the complaints by the
end of June. Mr Kohl hopes that a final decision will come before the summer
recess, but other officials are more cautious, suggesting that it may not be
ready until mid-September, or even early October.
That would still allow the special summit to be held by the end of October.
The incoming Belgian presidency of the EC yesterday declared its
determination to set up the European Monetary Institute on schedule by
January 1, 1994 - the start of the second stage of European monetary union,
Lionel Barber adds from Brussels.
In a speech in Brussels, Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister,
called upon EC member states to make the process toward Emu irreversible.
Failure to do so would encourage currency speculators, he said.
Federalist-minded Belgium takes over the presidency from Denmark on July 1.
