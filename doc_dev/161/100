Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, yesterday appeared to harden
the criteria for monetary union in Europe: he said that the conditions set
by the Maastricht treaty would have to be met at all times, not just during
periods of economic boom.
He said the Maastricht convergence criteria for economic and monetary union
in Europe had to be 'strictly observed'. 'It is crucial that entry into Emu
is open only to those countries which meet the criteria in full,' said Mr
Tietmeyer.
In particular, he said it was not good enough merely to reduce budget
deficits to within the agreed limit of 3 per cent of GDP in times of
economic boom. Countries needed to hold deficits below the 3 per cent mark
during their recovery periods as well.
Luxembourg and Ireland are the only two European Union member states which
meet the criteria at the moment.
His comments come amid renewed discussion recently about the prospect of a
multi-speed approach to European integration.
Speaking to the the German British Chamber of Commerce in London, Mr
Tietmeyer also fired a warning shot across the bows of the UK. He said:
'Countries that do not have the willingness and the readiness to enter into
a broadly conceived and politically constructive community of solidarity
should exercise caution in entering a monetary union.
'In the long run, any monetary union which lacks extensive political
underpinning is likely to remain a fragile construction.'
On the topical question of central bank support for the dollar, Mr Tietmeyer
was coy about the prospect of Bundesbank co-operation in any programme of
concerted intervention. The US Federal Reserve intervened to support the
ailing dollar on both Wednesday and Thursday.
'I welcome any action that is supporting the dollar. We are all interested
in a strong dollar, as we are, of course interested, at the same time, in a
strong D-Mark. We have no problem with the strong D-Mark.'
He said: 'Joint signals to the markets can under special circumstances play
a useful role.' But he stressed that to be successful, 'signals must be
based on consistent and credible policies.'
In his comments on Emu, Mr Tietmeyer chose to stress the fiscal aspect of
convergence. According to Maastricht, Emu and a single currency would only
come about if member states met treaty rules on convergence of inflation and
interest rates, budget deficits and government debt.
The 3 per cent fiscal target for budget deficits, Mr Tietmeyer stressed, was
'an indicator that should be met over some time. It cannot only be met in
one year, and in a special recovery when tax revenues are increasing
strongly.'
He said the deficit needed to be in line with the 3 per cent 'upper limit'
during the whole economic cycle. 'That means during a recovery, clearly you
have to be below 3 per cent, and not only to a small extent.'
Mr Tietmeyer said it would 'not be appropriate' to overshoot the 3 per cent
target. It should be seen as a 'maximum', rather than as an average.
He endorsed the view that of the two deadlines envisaged in the Maastricht
treaty for transition to monetary union, the prospects for 1999 were better
than for 1997. 'The chances that a majority of the EU countries will qualify
(for Emu) by the end of 1996, as stipulated by the treaty, are not very
great at the moment,' he said, noting that countries 'able' to form a
monetary union should do so. This 'inner circle' would be open to other
countries which later satisfied the economic criteria for joining.
