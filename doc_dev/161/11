The Belgian presidency of the European Union yesterday called for a stronger
role for the European Monetary Institute in the co-ordination of monetary
policies and the management of the exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, said the ERM crisis and
introduction of wider fluctuation bands last summer made closer co-operation
imperative.
Without 'a significant qualitative improvement' in this area, the goal of
monetary union by the end of the decade could be at risk.
In a speech to the European Finance Convention in Brussels, Mr Maystadt also
admitted that the January 1, 1999, deadline was more realistic than the
original 1997.
He offered several proposals for filling the political vacuum in the wake of
the August crisis which led to the introduction of 15 per cent fluctuation
bands for ERM currencies.
The EMI should be given 'an explicit role' in decisions leading to the entry
or realignment of an ERM currency.
States with low inflation might consider aligning their monetary policies to
a 'common intermediate target', in which case the EMI might be allowed to
issue joint statements on national policy decisions taken by central banks
in this low-inflation zone.
The ERM should be strengthened, possibly through a more equitable sharing of
potential exchange rate losses arising from open-ended interventions. This
is a response to Bundesbank criticism that its obligations to defend other
currencies was undermining its domestic monetary policies.
