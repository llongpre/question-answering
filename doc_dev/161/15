FT  08 OCT 93 / A caravan lost in the sands: Hard thinking on prospects for
European monetary union has begun

In a secluded hotel outside Brussels, European Community finance ministers
gather today for a strategy meeting that could also represent a session of
revelatory group therapy. For the first time since the summer monetary
crisis which led to the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate
mechanism, the ministers will discuss what went wrong, and what happens
next.
Although French and Belgian politicians have made intermittent statements
blaming 'Anglo-Saxon speculators' for the currency unrest, the public debate
on the lessons of the July-August debacle has barely begun.
But in private, there has been plenty of hard thinking about the future of
European monetary co-operation and the goal of economic and monetary union.
The question is whether the EC has the political will to chart a new course
to restore confidence in the project for economic and monetary union - or
whether European currencies will continue to drift apart.
The emergency agreement on August 2 on wider 15 per cent fluctuation bands
in the ERM brought the EC a breathing space after the successive currency
upsets since autumn 1992.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, has forecast a slippage of 'a year or
two' in the Maastricht timetable. The Bonn government and the Bundesbank,
however, maintain that the band widening leaves the EC fundamentally on
track for the Maastricht aim of achieving Emu by 1997 at the earliest and
1999 at the latest. In spite of discomfort in Paris over the weakening of
the French franc's link with the D-Mark, this view is backed by the French
government.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, has struck a jarring note by saying
the Emu plan has 'all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same
potency' - a statement which has caused irritation in the EC Commission in
Brussels.
In some German business and financial circles, there is agreement with Mr
Major's view that the Maastricht timetable is unrealistic - but this is a
long way from the official line in Bonn.
One point seems to be undisputed: there will be no return to the old ERM, in
which most currencies fluctuated around a 2 1/4 per cent band, until the
recession on the Continent has clearly come to an end. Earlier hopes of a
progressive narrowing of the 15 per cent fluctuation bands by the end of the
year have been quietly dropped.
Yet the common European interest in monetary stability should not be
under-estimated. Most member states want to avoid competitive currency
devaluations - shown by the way that ERM members have not used their
new-found flexibility during the last two months to lower their currencies
significantly against the D-Mark.
Far less common ground exists on what might replace the old narrow-band ERM
which was supposed to represent the route to Emu.
Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, has toyed with the idea of
curbing currency speculation by placing exchange controls on speculative
borrowing. His sentiments are fairly widely shared on the continent, but his
suggestion has drawn criticism from the UK, and even the French government
regards it as a non-runner.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC Commissioner for external affairs, has meanwhile urged
states to stick to the Maastricht objectives but to make use of their
greater exchange rate flexibility. He has called on countries such as France
and Belgium to take advantage of the looser ERM arrangements to cut interest
rates and promote economic recovery.
In Brussels, the Commission is pinning its hopes on the European Monetary
Institute. It is to be set on January 1, 1994 - at the beginning of
so-called 'stage two' of Emu - as the forerunner of a future European
Central Bank.
One idea circulating in Brussels is that individual central banks should
pool resources so the EMI can intervene to defend embattled currencies. This
idea is, however, rejected by the Bundesbank, which wants to retain complete
autonomy before the planned establishment of a fully-fledged EC central
bank.
A broader goal of most EC governments is to use the EMI to help persuade the
Bundesbank take other countries' economies into account when taking interest
rate decisions. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said this
week he hopes the EMI will ease the 'frustrations' of having to wait 'week
by week' for the Bundesbank to lower interest rates.
So far, member states have failed to agree on the EMI's location or its
president. EC leaders will try to break the deadlock at a special summit on
October 29, when the Community is expected to place the EMI in Germany.
However sensitive the question of where to site the EMI, the real issue is
the drive by other EC members to draw the Bundesbank into a more formal
system of monetary co-operation.
Much will depend on the state of the Franco-German alliance, which was badly
bruised during the summer. Mr Horst Teltschik, former foreign policy adviser
to Chancellor Kohl, and now a board member with the Munich-based BMW motor
group, describes French requests for unlimited support for the franc during
the monetary upset as irritating: 'They sometimes confuse our interests with
theirs,' he says.
One senior member of the Bundesbank council singles out for criticism Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, over his much-publicised
call in June for the Bundesbank to lower interest rates: 'He is a beginner,
and he made a beginner's mistakes.'
France wanted to take advantage of Germany's perceived economic weakness
caused by reunification to push for greater monetary co-ordination. The
signs are that Paris has not abandoned this strategy.
In August, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, persuaded Mr Kohl
to agree to a 'convergence' programme which Brussels and Paris officials
believe could pave the way for more institutionalised co-operation.
The immediate outlook, however, for progress along the path towards Emu
appears gloomy. Three obstacles are apparent.
Germany's own post-unity problems. Large fiscal transfers from west to east
Germany - currently more than DM150bn a year - will be needed for at least
another decade to maintain east German living standards. During this period
of strain for the 'anchor' economy in Europe, Germany is unlikely to be
politically or economically ready to subsume its D-Mark into a single
European currency.
The diminishing chances that member states can meet the Maastricht
convergence targets, set down as conditions for Emu. This year, general
government deficits across the EC will average about 6 per cent of GDP -
double the 3 per cent target set at Maastricht.
The increasing temptation for European countries to see exchange rate
flexibility as a means of solving economic problems. Britain, Italy, Sweden
have shown that devaluation can be the clue to lowering interest rates and
restoring modest economic growth.
France's position is crucial. It remains torn between its desire to maintain
a tight link with the D-Mark and its need to engineer an economic recovery.
The Paris government's cautious monetary policy since August has allowed
French long-term interest rates to fall again to German levels. France is
hoping for a faster lowering of German interest rates next year, and a
corresponding weakening of the D-Mark. But this is a gamble for the Balladur
government as France heads towards the 1995 presidential elections.
The French strategy underlines how the Bundesbank remains the EC's supreme
monetary arbiter. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, its new president, last week signalled
that the central bank's policies would remain geared to Germany's economic
priorities, not the rest of Europe.
Thus for all the ERM's new-found flexibility, the Bundesbank's
anti-inflation stubbornness could still cause difficulties. Some EC
Commission officials worry that members of the ERM 'hard-core' such as
France, Belgium and Denmark will be unable to maintain their recent currency
stability unless they soon act to restore economic growth through more
aggressive cuts in interest rates. If these cuts do not materialise, these
Brussels officials believe, another currency upheaval could be in store - an
event which would postpone Emu until the next century.
