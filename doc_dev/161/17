MR ALEXANDRE Lamfalussy, president-elect of the European Monetary Institute,
has promised to be a strong critic of 'unbalanced' economic policies which
threaten the European Community's objective of monetary union.
In the first public indication of how he sees his role - contained in
written answers to members of the European Parliament - Mr Lamfalussy also
cast doubt on a return to the old European exchange rate mechanism, saying
he was not sure it was 'a realistic objective'.
Mr Lamfalussy is due to appear tomorrow before the parliament's committee on
economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy. MEPs must deliver an
opinion on his candidacy before he can be formally confirmed as president of
the Frankfurt-based forerunner of a European central bank. He is currently
general manager of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. His
written replies to the committee's questions were obtained yesterday by the
Financial Times.
The EMI will supervise the second stage of Emu, beginning on January 1 1994,
and advise EC members on monetary and exchange rate policy leading up to
full currency union by 1999.
In his reply to the parliament's questionnaire, Mr Lamfalussy said the EMI
would be more than just a passive observer of EC economic and monetary
policy.
In particular, he said he would be prepared to highlight any imbalances
between monetary and fiscal and other economic policies which could
jeopardise the Emu aims. 'I shall make it my duty to draw attention to the
risks arising from an unbalanced policy mix,' he said.
He indicated he would be ready to act decisively if monetary and economic
policies appeared to be contradictory, and make full use of the EMI's power
to encourage dialogue between central banks and governments.
'At a certain point . . . if and when divergencies persist, public opinion
should be made aware of potential conflicts and of their possible
consequences,' he said.
Referring to August's decision to allow ERM currencies to fluctuate more
widely, Mr Lamfalussy said the currency crises of the past 18 months had
removed the 'disciplinary framework' which had helped promote convergence of
monetary policies.
He said co-ordinating monetary policies effectively in such a situation
would be one of the EMI's main challenges.
The EMI 'should spare no effort' to prevent exchange rate fluctuations
undermining the single market, he said. But he added: 'I am sure that it
would not be advisable to set any precise timetable for re-establishing a
more constraining exchange rate mechanism.' Member states should wait until
the business cycle had improved and renewed progress could be made towards
'broadly based convergence'.
