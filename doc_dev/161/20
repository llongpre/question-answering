EU member states have turned a corner and could realistically consider the
prospect of a single European currency, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president
of the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the European Central Bank,
declared yesterday.
Falling interest rates, low inflation and close monetary co-ordination among
EU central banks had substantially reduced currency instability, Mr
Lamfalussy said. In one or two years, there could be some 'pleasant
surprises' among countries aspiring to join the planned economic and
monetary union.
Mr Lamfalussy's upbeat remarks to the European economic and social committee
in Brussels came ahead of weekend talks among EU finance ministers in
Lindau, near Lake Constance. They will discuss the procedures for dealing
with big national budget deficits, one of the most important tests for Emu
membership.
Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, has signalled it is unhappy
with the European Commission recommendation to exclude Ireland from the
'excessive deficits' rules. Luxembourg, the only country which meets
Maastricht's deficit criteria, is also excluded.
The Commission supports a generous interpretation of the debt rules because
Ireland has in recent years held its annual budget deficit within the
Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But Germany does
not want to create a precedent that will make it easier for countries with
bigger debt problems, such as Italy, to become full Emu members.
The EU's secretive monetary committee, meeting in Brussels yesterday, was
said to have approved Commission proposals for deficit reduction procedures
by EU states other than Luxembourg and Ireland.
Mr Lamfalussy steered clear of the controversy over proposals to create a
'hard core' of five nations committed to faster integration in the EU.
Germany's ruling Christian Democrat party and its CSU coalition partner
proposed last week that the hard core should consist of France, Germany,
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Mr Lamfalussy stressed it was too soon to predict which EU members would be
ready to form a monetary union by 1997 or 1999, the two dates named in the
Maastricht treaty.
Without mentioning Italy, Spain or the UK, the EMI president paid tribute to
countries which seemed to have escaped 'the infernal cycle of inflation',
even while allowing their currencies to depreciate during the monetary
upheaval of 1992-93.
