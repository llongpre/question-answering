optimistic assessment of EU economies

Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute,
declared yesterday that EU member states had turned a corner and could
realistically consider the prospect of a single European currency.
Falling interest rates, low inflation, and close monetary co-ordination
among EU central banks had substantially reduced currency instability, Mr
Lamfalussy said. In one or two years, there could be some 'pleasant
surprises' among countries aspiring to join the planned economic and
monetary union.
Mr Lamfalussy's upbeat remarks to the European economic and social committee
in Brussels came ahead of weekend talks among EU finance ministers. Their
meeting in Lindau, near Lake Constance, will discuss politically sensitive
procedures for dealing with big national budget deficits, one of the most
important tests for Emu membership.
Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, has signalled it is unhappy
with the European Commission recommendation to exclude Ireland from the
'excessive deficits' rules. Luxembourg, the only country which meets
Maastricht's deficit criteria, is also excluded.
The Commission supports a generous interpretation of the debt rules because
Ireland has in recent years held its annual budget deficit within the
Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But Germany does
not want to create a precedent that will make it easier for countries with
bigger debt problems, such as Italy, to become full Emu members.
The EU's secretive monetary committee, meeting in Brussels yesterday, was
said to have approved Commission proposals for deficit reduction procedures
by EU states other than Luxembourg and Ireland.
Mr Lamfalussy steered clear of the controversy over proposals to create a
'hard core' of five nations committed to faster integration in the EU. The
ruling Christian Democrat party and its CSU coalition partner proposed last
week that the hard core should consist of France, Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg.
France, Germany and the Benelux are often viewed as the most likely nucleus
of the planned monetary union. But Mr Lamfalussy stressed it was too soon to
predict which EU members would be ready to form a union by 1997 or 1999, the
two dates named in the treaty.
Without mentioning Italy, Spain or the UK, the EMI president paid tribute to
countries which seemed to have escaped 'the infernal cycle of inflation',
even while allowing their currencies to depreciate during the monetary
upheaval of 1992-93.
This turbulence, which led to the widening of fluctuation bands in the
European Monetary System in August 1992, appeared to be over, said Mr
Lamfalussy. However, he insisted that the wider EMS bands should be
preserved in order to defend currencies against speculative pressures.
