The European Monetary Institute, expected to be established on January 1 to
supervise the move towards economic and monetary union, will lead a phantom
existence for the first six months of its life.
The EMI, forerunner of a European central bank, will be based in Frankfurt.
But its shareholders - national central banks from European Union countries
 -will take at least until the end of next month to decide where to house
the institute.
The provisional nature of the EMI's initial running arrangements symbolises
the faltering progress towards Emu after the emergency widening of
fluctuation bands forced by the summer currency crisis.
Governors of the 12 central banks will hold a formal inaugural meeting of
the EMI on January 11 in the rebuilt fifteenth century Frankfurt city hall.
At least until the summer, though, the EMI will be run from Basle,
headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements and the site of the
present 34-strong secretariat of the committee of European central bank
governors.
That means that Mr Andrew Crockett, who takes over as BIS general manager on
January 1, will 'cohabit' for several months in Basle with Mr Alexandre
Lamfalussy, the EMI's president-designate, and the BIS's current general
manager.
Mr Crockett, at present the Bank of England's international director, was
selected in the autumn to succeed Mr Lamfalussy.
The EMI is looking for an office that will hold no more than 150 to 250
people. A larger site capable of housing a fully-fledged central bank has
been ruled out.
Although no budget for the EMI's first-year costs has been drawn up, central
banks are expected to face a 'nasty surprise' on the high cost of
refurbishment, according to one well-informed official. In particular, it
includes the task of equipping the chosen office for the task of holding
three simultaneous round-table meetings of European central bankers.
The EMI is expected to employ between 130 and 150 staff by the end of 1994,
many of whom will be seconded from central banks. Most will be economists
and statisticians.
The EMI will pool information about European financial developments, help to
harmonise monetary statistics and instruments, and host regular meetings of
European central bankers.
During the so-called stage two of the move to Emu, which begins on January
1, monetary decision-making will remain in the hands of national central
banks. Joint decisions on monetary policy will not be made until the
irrevocable fixing of exchange rates under stage three of Emu. According to
the Maastricht treaty, that is due between 1997 and 1999.
The EMI will take over some of the technical arrangements for running the
European Monetary System which are at present handled by the BIS.
