SIX Christian Democrat leaders headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl last night
agreed in principle to convene a special EC summitimmediately after full
ratification of the Maastricht treaty to relaunch the drive to political and
monetary union.
The move underlines impatience among federalist-minded Europeans at the
delay in ratifying the treaty and their determination to put all aspects of
Maastricht into force, whatever the reservations in Britain.
Meeting in Brussels yesterday were the heads of government of Germany,
Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Greece as well as the Italian
foreign minister.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, said last night the summit
could help end uncertainty about the EC's future. 'It would send a message
to Europe that we know where we are going.'
A more specific goal would be to settle the site of the European Monetary
Institute, forerunner of a European central bank in the planned monetary
union (Emu).
Prospects for agreement at next month's EC summit in Copenhagen are
considered slim, but the EMI is due to start operation next January 1 - the
official launch of the second stage of Emu.
The idea of an special summit emerged during talks between Chancellor Kohl,
President Francois Mitterrand, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France
which ended in Beaune yesterday. The Christian Democrat leaders gave the
initiative broad support without taking a final decision.
Mr Dehaene, who will chair EC heads of government meetings when Belgium
takes over the EC presidency on July 1, said he needed to discuss it with
his coalition partners.
