MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, will today begin a
campaign to breathe life into the Maastricht treaty to build up momentum
ahead of Friday's special EC summit in Brussels.
Working with the Belgian Presidency of the EC, Mr Delors will call for
closer macro-economic co-operation and a strengthening of the faltering EC
'growth' initiative at a meeting of EC finance ministers today in
Luxembourg.
The meeting marks the start of an intensive round of European diplomacy
which could end on Friday with a decision on the site of a future EC central
bank, more openness in the Community, and new 'joint actions' to intensify
humanitarian operations in former Yugoslavia and monitor the parliamentary
elections in Russia set for December.
However, the summit could still be clouded by disagreements over
implementation of economic and monetary union. Mr John Major, the British
prime minister, yesterday dismissed attempts by some of Britain's European
partners to re-establish the Maastricht timetable for a single currency as
'folly'.
He also indicated Britain would strongly resist any watering down of the
economic convergence criteria for economic and monetary union, saying the
criteria - covering such things as relative inflation rates and the size of
public sector deficits - were 'desirable in their own right'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, is expected to reinforce that point at
today's meeting of Community finance ministers by telling colleagues that
the criteria have a role independent of the proposed timetable for a single
currency in promoting sustainable economic growth.
Elsewhere, the pre-summit mood has been improved by the Bundesbank's
unexpected decision to trim short-term interest rates by half a point.
However, member states such as Belgium and France remain wary of cutting
rates for fear of breaking their link with the D-Mark in spite of the
increased flexibility offered by wider 15 per cent fluctuation bands in the
European exchange rate mechanism,
Mr Delors views Friday's summit as a chance to relaunch the Community after
months of drift caused by the delay in ratification of Maastricht. He wants
EC leaders to agree to closer macro-economic co-operation exploiting the
provisions of the treaty.
At today's Luxembourg meeting, finance ministers will put the final touches
to legislation allowing the second stage of Europeon monetary union to begin
on January 1 1994. This would also create the European Monetary Institute,
the precursor of the European Central Bank.
