<F P=106> [Editorial: "Europe's New Monetary Forum"] </F>
  [Text] At a season associated with the arrival of wise men, 
the establishment of a new institution to supervise European 
monetary arrangements might be heralded as a sign of hope. The 
European Monetary Institute [EMI] is being formally set up on 
January 1 as part of the European Union's so-called second stage 
of progress towards economic and monetary union. By 
concentrating on a few necessary tasks, firmly defined by 
governments and central banks, the EMI can improve the prospects 
for successful monetary integration. 
  Conceived as an embryonic European central bank, the 
institute will have to lower its sights from the ideas that 
inspired its creation. An important priority will be to improve 
co-ordination within the present European Monetary System [EMS], 
which is a long way from carrying out its original and still 
badly needed function of providing a stable exchange rate 
environment for European business. 
  In view of the EMS disturbances since autumn 1992, along 
with 
other setbacks to the Maastricht timetable for a single 
currency, the gestation period for the new monetary body has 
been highly problematic. Because of delays in deciding to place 
the institute in Germany, the EMI will not even be able to move 
to a permanent home in Frankfurt before the summer. 
  In 1988-89, when plans for setting up the institute were 
first laid, the European Commission, backed by the French and 
Italian governments, wanted it to carry out some fully-fledged 
central banking operations. This idea has been watered down, 
above all because of opposition from the German Bundesbank. 
Monetary decisionmaking will remain the preserve of the EMI's 
12 member central banks. French-backed proposals for the EMI to 
help manage currency reserves look unlikely to get off the 
ground. 
<H5>  Harmonisation Drive </H5>
  The task of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the EMI's designated 
president, will thus be to assemble a staff of statisticians and 
economists, rather than to wield power. 
  This does not mean that the EMI will not have a job to do. 
First, it will have to accomplish detailed technical work to 
prepare for the harmonisation of monetary statistics and money 
market instruments that forms an essential precondition for EMU 
[Economic Monetary Union]. If the harmonisation drive leads to 
an increase in efficiency of different countries' monetary 
systems, then the benefits would extend beyond making EMU more 
viable. 
  Second, the EMI can provide a forum for general debate on 
European monetary matters. Mr Lamfalussy sees the need to 
uphold the consensus on the desirability of EMU, but he also has 
the experience and independence to speak plainly about the 
hurdles that lie in its path. He will be helped in his task of 
nurturing public understanding of Europe's unhealthily secretive 
central banking system, if the EMI is required to publish 
detailed minutes of its monthly meeting of central bank 
governors. 
<H5>  Vital Arbiter </H5>
  Third, in a less high-profile role, the EMI president can 
function as an arbiter, providing advice and assistance to 
member countries. The misunderstandings and mismanagement 
evident during the monetary system flare-ups in September 1992 
and July-August 1993 could have been lessened had an 
intermediary been on hand to adjudicate between countries 
pursuing different monetary priorities, or even to ensure that 
rival positions were clearly communicated and understood. 
  After the upsets of the past 17 months, it seems still more 
likely than before that EMU, if it takes place at all, will be 
reached first by a relatively small group of countries willing 
to combine a lasting political commitment to EMU with a 
readiness to gear their monetary policies to Germany's. If 
monetary convergence stops short of EMU, the task of managing 
that process will require expertise and sensitivity of the 
highest order. 
  Creating a new institute will not, by itself, solve Europe's 
monetary problems. But if it can successfully combine the roles 
of trouble-shooter and think-tank, the EMI will have a good 
chance of bringing Europe closer to objectives that individual 
central banks are incapable of fulfilling. It is a welcome 
addition to the institutional landscape of the European Union.
