EUROPE is entering a 'test phase' for monetary union, when individual
central banks have it within their power to create a solid basis for it, the
president of the Bundesbank said yesterday.
Countries now had to prove the credibility of their national monetary
policy, rather than engage in disputes over the framework of European
monetary union (Emu) as set down in the Maastricht treaty, Mr Hans Tietmeyer
told the VWD news agency.
This would be the only way that monetary union had a chance of being
successfully implemented in practice, Mr Tietmeyer cautioned. Countries
would have to show a firm commitment to monetary stability in the years
ahead and implement the institutional changes necessary to give national
central banks the necessary independence.
It was also important for public opinion to develop a 'stability culture',
he said. Mr Tietmeyer was giving his reaction to the German Constitutional
Court's ruling on Tuesday that Germany's ratification of the Maastricht
treaty was valid.
The second stage of monetary union is due to to start on January 1 next year
when the European Monetary Institute (EMI) will start operations. Mr
Tietmeyer said its role would be to strengthen co-operation between EC
central banks and to co-ordinate the monetary policy of member nations with
a view to price stability.
But responsibility for monetary policy will remain with national central
banks during the second stage of monetary union, and all important decisions
on the EMS will continue to be taken unanimously, he said. Mr Tietmeyer
reiterated his call for the EMI to be located in Frankfurt.
