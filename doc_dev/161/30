These are busy days for Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European
Monetary Institute. After 10 months squatting in buildings belonging to the
Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, the forerunner of the
planned European central bank is about to move to its new home in Frankfurt
and start working at full speed.
From the 35th floor of an office block re-christened the 'Eurotower',
Lamfalussy will preside over a staff of around 150, who will be charged with
making possible European monetary union according to the procedures laid
down by the Maastricht treaty.
It is a two-pronged task. The EMI's job is to make the preparations needed
for setting up the European System of Central Banks and, with that, a single
monetary policy and single currency, if and when the EU moves to the third
and final stage of Emu.
The institute also has to help prepare for Stage 3 by co-ordinating monetary
policy among the EU's 12 central banks and promoting the convergence of the
EU member states' economies on a path of sustained low inflationary growth
in the present Stage 2 of Emu.
Although the EMI is about 10 months behind schedule - thanks to prolonged
wrangling among European Union countries over its eventual site - Lamfalussy
is hopeful it will be able to achieve its goals.
Interviewed in his still-temporary headquarters in the BIS, he says: 'Things
are not as negative as they looked a year ago. Europe is enjoying a
broad-based, non-inflationary recovery. If this goes on for two to three
years it will create a climate which at least provides a framework for the
political decisions to move ahead.'
Like most Belgians, the 65-year-old Lamfalussy is a card-carrying Emu
enthusiast. In his previous capacity as BIS general manager, he was a member
of the Delors committee of central bankers that in the late 1980s plotted
the three-stage route march to monetary union, later adopted in the
Maastricht treaty.
But Lamfalussy is also a realist. Achieving Emu by 1997, the earliest
possible date envisaged in the Maastricht treaty, he says 'is not very
plausible' because it is difficult to imagine seven of the 12 EU member
states fulfilling the treaty's strict economic convergence criteria by then.
On the other hand, his belief is that there will eventually be a European
central bank 'in five, six or 10 years' time.'
'The degree of internationalisation and integration of our economies is so
fast and the European single market is moving ahead so fast and is going so
deep, that so many vested interests will want stable exchange rates,' he
says.
His gut feeling, speaking as an economist, is that Britain will be unable to
stand aside from Emu. But whether the UK joins Emu is a matter of high
politics. The EMI has to focus on nitty-gritty matters and achieve agreement
on such technically difficult issues as the preparation of banknotes to be
used after the introduction of a single currency, as well as the drawing up
of common features of payments systems in the EU.
A potentially difficult issue is management of the single monetary policy.
The Bundesbank is actively promoting the notion that the proposed European
central bank should follow its example and set monetary policy according to
a money supply measure, while the Bank of England is promoting its more
eclectic approach of steering policy according to an inflation target.
Here, too, Lamfalussy is relatively sanguine. There is, he explains, 'no
cleavage in ideology' among the European central bank governors that make up
the EMI's council. All agree on the need for low inflation and the paramount
importance of governments reducing their fiscal deficits.
There may be different techniques of monetary management but there are also
similarities. The Bank of England, for example, looks at narrow and broad
money figures as part of its policy for controlling inflation.
Reconciling differences will be a big part of Lamfalussy's job at the EMI.
As president, he is both chief executive officer and chairman of the board.
His task will be 'to make sure things are going to happen,' driving the
technical committees - comprised of EMI staffers and national central bank
officials - so that they come with answers to problems.
He has been able to hand-pick his senior staff and has managed to avoid
placing people in posts according to national quotas.
Although Frankfurt-based, the institute's working language will be English.
But language will be the least of Lamfalussy's problems. He has perfected
his English since a spell as a research student at Nuffield College, Oxford,
in the 1950s. That was shortly after he fled to Belgium from Hungary at the
age of 20 to escape communism.
He was a bank economist and academic until the mid-1970s, when he became an
executive director and chairman of the Banque de Bruxelles. He joined the
BIS in 1976 and was general manager of the central bankers' bank from 1985
until the end of last year.
He can claim to be the inventor of the EMI because, as a member of the
Delors committee, he proposed that Europe's central banks should create a
joint subsidiary to advance the progress of Emu in Stage 2.
The job of running the institute is 'different from anything else I have
ever done before,' he says. He admits that he had more power as BIS general
manager because, as the man in charge of the central bankers' bank, he was
'living the markets' and had to take banking decisions.
It is the banking that he misses most: 'It was great fun, of great interest,
and it gave me, as an economist, a lot of feedback'.
On the other hand he believes he has much greater influence as head of the
EMI. 'I have a much more politically exposed profile, there is no doubt
about that. Even if you define the job in a narrow technical way, it still
has very deep political connotations.'
Then there is challenge of building a new institution. 'I have never built
an institution in my life. You can't imagine what it means to build up
something from scratch. It is a very, very full time job.
'I am trying to use the present relatively calm waters to make the
institution function, to build up its staff and working methods. If and when
a crisis breaks, we will see how I shall be able to handle it'.
Lamfalussy has been appointed for three years. At the moment he has no
intention of seeking to extend his term beyond 1996.
But given Europe's recent turbulent monetary history there is no guarantee
that he will avoid adding crisis management to his workload.
