FT  05 MAY 92 / Race for Europe's central bank hots up: An acrimonious
tussle between governments

WHEN Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris, entertained Sir Brian Jenkins, Lord
Mayor of London, to lunch last Tuesday the two men had billions of dollars
on their minds.
Sir Brian was in Paris, accompanied by Mr Pen Kent, an associate director at
the Bank of England, as part of a Pounds 1.5m campaign by the City to try to
bring the future European central bank (ECB) to London.
It was the latest move in an acrimonious tussle over the site of the EC's
planned supranational monetary institution, a dispute primarily pitting
Britain against Germany, which has lodged a strong bid to make Frankfurt the
ECB's home.
Under plans for European monetary union (Emu) by the end of the century, the
ECB would operate interest rate policies across Europe and pool huge
quantities of foreign exchange reserves. At stake is not simply the prestige
of hosting the bank which controls European money, but also the additional
financial business activity which could be brought in its wake.
EC heads of government are scheduled to decide on the issue by the end of
the year, possibly at the EC summit in Edinburgh in December. Initially they
have to choose a site for the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the
embryonic central bank which is due to open its doors at the start of stage
two of Emu on January 1 1994.
The EMI will be converted into a fully-fledged central bank when the third
and final stage of Emu starts  - either in 1997 or in 1999, on present EC
plans.
Because of the complexities of the problem  - which also involves decisions
on the sites of a number of other European institutions  - the matter may
drag on into next year. The Paris Foreign Ministry, for instance, says
France will block any decision on the site of the central bank until the EC
agrees that Strasbourg will be the permanent home of the European
parliament.
Central bankers warn that postponement would greatly damage chances of
choosing staff and facilities for the EMI in time for its planned start-up.
Paris has not put in a bid to attract the ECB, although both Lyons and
Strasbourg are contenders. But Mr Chirac, as one of the leaders of France's
right-wing opposition, will play a role in forming public opinion on the
issue.
Sir Brian met Mr Chirac above all to try to enlist France's support to stop
the ECB going to Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Bundesbank have
energetically backed Frankfurt, arguing that a decision in the city's favour
is necessary to combat unease in Germany about giving up the D-Mark.
A more likely outcome of London's high-profile campaigning, however, will be
to encourage EC governments to place the bank in a city outside one of the
continent's three largest financial centres. This would prevent either
London, Frankfurt or Paris claiming that one of the other centres was
clinching an unfair competitive advantage.
On this reckoning, Amsterdam is a clear favourite as a compromise.
'People know that smaller countries get their chance when larger countries
disagree. Then the choice should be for Amsterdam,' says one Dutch official.
If Amsterdam was held to infringe the competitive status of, say, Paris,
then a still more modest financial centre  - Luxembourg  - would come into
the running.
Germany's insistent pro-Frankfurt stance is prompting criticism from other
EC countries. One top European central banker  - from a country not seeking
for itself the ECB site  - said: 'They (the Germans) are bringing it to a
level at which it is difficult to have a reasonable discussion.'
London's candidature, on the other hand, is greeted with derision from
German officials. They point out that Britain is the only EC country not to
have declared its willingness to proceed to the (final) stage three of Emu.
Germany is stepping up the drumbeat in favour of Frankfurt. Bonn has stopped
short of suggesting it will not ratify the Maastricht treaty unless the
Commission opts for Frankfurt. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minster, has
however said that Germany will find it more difficult to accept a single
European currency unless the decision-making centre is Frankfurt.
According to Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive of Commerzbank, the
third largest German bank, Frankfurt is the 'obvious and logical' choice. In
view of the symbolic importance of Frankfurt as the home of the Bundesbank,
Mr Kohlhaussen argues that a vote for any other city would appear as if
'stability as the precondition of a hard currency was no longer seen as so
important'.
Central bankers point out that, for money dealing purposes, the geographical
location of the bank is irrelevant.
The decision will be a matter of pure politics. Other matters, for instance
on the application of the Maastricht criteria drawn up to decide which
countries should join Emu, are economically more important. The wrangling
indicates, however, that  - nearly five years before the earliest date at
which monetary union could actually start - the political consensus behind
Emu is still remarkably fragile.
