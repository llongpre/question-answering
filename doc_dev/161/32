Democracies are notoriously bad at making long-term plans.
So it is not surprising that between the Danish 'no' vote in June and the
French referendum on September 20, few policymakers seem to be thinking hard
about more distant issues relating to European economic and monetary union.
Admittedly, the Maastricht Treaty is heavy going. But while last week's
opinion polls in France showed a slip in support for Maastricht, the odds
must still be in favour of a French 'yes' vote.
In these circumstances, European finance ministries and central banks should
be thinking hard about the many difficult issues still to be solved along
the route to a single European Currency Unit and central bank. And arguably,
no nation should be giving more thought to the minutiae of Emu than Britain.
The Maastricht Treaty determined that the Ecu should be the eventual
European currency but left much else unclear about the final shape of Emu
and about how much responsibility for managing it will be left to the
individual European Community states.
Since Maastricht, much attention has focused on the need for governments to
agree a home for the proposed European Central Bank and its forerunner, the
European Monetary Institute. As the EMI is due to start preparing the
community for Emu from 1994, the timetable is looking tight. The showdown on
this issue is due at the next European summit in Edinburgh in December.
But there are other big problems. The contours of Europe's future monetary
policy are still unclear, including the amount of responsibility to be left
to national central banks under the principle of subsidiarity, which calls
for decisions to be taken at the lowest possible level of government.
These questions at least are being considered by experts reporting to the
EC's committee of central bank governors. The governors have also asked a
committee to start considering the potentially emotive issue of the design
of future EC-wide bank notes.
Other matters concerning the Ecu seem to be in limbo. EC states will have to
agree on names for the 10th or 100th parts of the Ecu, a matter ignored in
the Maastricht Treaty.
Computers and accounting systems will need to be adapted to Ecu.
Each EC country will need a full legislative framework defining the Ecu and
making it legal tender.
A recent report from the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe and
Barclays Bank gives an idea of what the change to the Ecu could entail for
companies. 'Thinking and planning for the single currency needs to start
now,' it said.
No wonder. The report urged each company to set up an internal working group
to address the change. Such groups, reporting to the main board, should
include people involved in 'purchasing, marketing, pricing and sales;
borrowing, investing, lending, treasury management, accounting; contracts
and legal affairs and information systems'. Banks would have to review the
impact of Emu on matters ranging from foreign exchange, capital markets to
automatic cash dispensers. Retailers would have to examine stock management
and point of sales systems.
While the treaty envisages 1997 as the earliest deadline for monetary union,
1999 appears a more likely date. But 1999 is not so far away in view of the
complex problems to be solved. British decimalisation, a relatively easy
affair, took five years' planning. Some officials believe it could take 10
years to complete the technical work to implement Emu. Even then, there
would be no guarantee that abandonment of national currencies such as the
D-Mark or sterling in favour of the Ecu would be politically acceptable to
the peoples of Europe.
These factors are prompting some monetary officials to question the present
plans for stage three of Emu, which envisage irrevocably locking parities
and then moving as quickly as possible to the Ecu as the EC's single
currency. Instead, they believe that the community should not rush to leave
stage '3A' in which a European system of central banks would operate a
single monetary policy but retain national currencies at permanently fixed
exchange rates.
One obvious loss from not moving to a single currency would be the continued
need for travellers to change bank notes at national frontiers. But truely
fixed parities would reduce transaction costs to a minimum. Most travellers
would pay costs abroad with credit or cash cards. Big businesses could
behave as if the Ecu were already the European currency.
The big advantage of an extended stage 3A would be political. EC countries
could wait for companies to adapt and popular support to grow in favour of
the Ecu and so avoid the tensions and backlashes - possibly amounting to the
rejection of governments by their electorates  - that imposing a strange,
unfamiliar money might produce if the D-Mark, sterling or French franc were
to be removed overnight.
For Mr John Major such an approach would have the attraction of taking on
some of the spirit of the UK government's earlier evolutionary approach to
Emu which he espoused when chancellor.
But an extended stage 3A would have to be negotiated. The EC Commission and
the 'Club Med' nations led by Italy and France could be expected to oppose
the idea.
A useful start for Britain would be to recognise that the battle to base the
EMI and the ECB is London is lost and that the bank will go to Bonn just as
soon as the German government decides to drop its formal support for
Frankfurt.
If Mr Major is really serious about placing Britain at the 'heart of Europe'
he could then start pressing for an extended stage 3A in an economic and
monetary union that would stand a better chance of gaining support in the
Tory Party and parliament.
