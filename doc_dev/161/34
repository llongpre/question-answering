FT  24 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Kiss of life fof Ecu bond
market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S ratification of the Maastricht Treaty last week provided a welcome
kiss of life for the Ecu bond market.
And with the Danish referendum out of the way, the Ecu Committee of the
European Bond Commission - an industry organisation - was quick to announce
clarifications over the role of the Ecu as the single European currency for
the benefit of market participants.
Mr Bob Tyley, chairman of the Ecu Committee and an economist at Paribas
Capital Markets Group, said the committee had received clarifications from
the European Commission and the European Council on the role of the Ecu.
'We found that certain aspects of the Ecu were not very well understood,' he
said, but added that the clarifications provide market operators with a
'concise and reliable reference for the development of the Ecu' which can be
seen as an appendix to the Maastricht Treaty.
'With regard to the current basket Ecu prior to the commencement of European
Monetary Union, its currency composition will be frozen once the treaty has
been ratified,' Mr Tyley said. The European Monetary Institute, which will
be set up on January 1 1994, will facilitate the use of the Ecu and oversee
its development.
The Ecu will lose its current basket nature and become a currency in its own
right on the first day of monetary union, and rapid introduction of the Ecu
as the single currency will ensue. On the first day of EMU, the exchange
rates between participating national currencies and the Ecu will be fixed
irrevocably, and the Ecu will rapidly replace those currencies.
EMU will start on January 1 1999 unless another date has been decided
beforehand. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the EC, stressed in a letter to
the Ecu Committee that this could take place well ahead of 1999.
'Sufficient conditions for this to be the case are that a majority of
countries qualify for membership (on the basis of the convergence criteria)
and that the European Monetary Institute has completed its work of
preparation of Stage 3 (which it will start to do after its creation on
January 1 1994 and must finish by December 31 1996 at the latest).'
