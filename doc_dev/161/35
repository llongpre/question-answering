THE European Commission remains adamant. Despite siren calls from London and
other Euro-sceptical quarters, EC officials insist there will no fundamental
shift in strategy in response to the de facto suspension of the exchange
rate mechanism.
Mr Jacques Delors made clear during last Friday's special meeting of the
European Commission that the EC must 'tough out' the latest crisis - mainly
by using the tools offered by the Maastricht treaty for reinforcing economic
and monetary co-operation within the Community.
The Commission president is also reported to be pinning some hope on a
Franco-German political initiative before the EC summit in Brussels in
December. This would serve to show the rest of the Community that the
Franco-German alliance remains in good working order, but it would also
demonstrate that European monetary union remains on track.
Recent comment in the British and US press about a permanent rift between
the French and Germans in the run-up to the ERM crisis is dismissed inside
the Commission as 'wishful thinking'. The official view is that
Franco-German differences were not so serious as to overwhelm the European
monetary system. 'The structures remain, even if (some of) the rules have
changed,' said one official.
Mr Delors recognises, however, that the ERM crisis has created a vacuum in
monetary co-operation. This explains the importance which he attaches to two
separate reports which the Commission will publish before next January 1,
starting-point for Emu's second stage.
The first report will focus on the progress which the 12 member states have
made on economic and monetary convergence; the second will set out the main
political and economic guidelines for the Community, to be adopted by a
qualified majority vote of the Twelve.
According to EC monetary officials, both these reports should be used to
define the EC's future route to Emu as set out in Maastricht. The British
proposal to revive the 'hard Ecu' is likely to get short shrift in Brussels.
One option to convince the financial markets that the Community is serious
about monetary union would be to narrow the ERM's newly widened fluctuation
bands. These were fixed at 15 per cent nine days ago to halt speculation
against the franc and weaker ERM currencies; but EC officials note with
satisfaction that Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark are all seeking to return
to their 'narrow bands' rather than rushing towards lower interest rates.
Another favoured option is to strike a deal on the location of the European
Monetary Institute, the precursor of the European central bank, which would
supervise a putative single EC currency. Such a bargain would also include a
'big name' to run the EMI, most likely a current EC central bank governor,
but possibly an outsider.
The policy is characteristic of Mr Delors, a man who believes that a little
pain is often necessary for true salvation. It is also reminiscent of a
certain former British prime minister who declared, with similar conviction,
that 'there is no alternative'.
