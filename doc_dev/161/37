the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels

European Union leaders yesterday prepared the way for much closer
co-operation on macro-economic performance in the run-up to full economic
and monetary union.
They agreed the principle of legally binding macro-economic guidelines,
including a general call for lower interest rates, wage restraint, lower
budget deficits and government debt. But French objections to the details
delayed formal adoption of the proposals.
Mr Henning Christophersen, European economics commissioner, said the
guidelines - required under the Maastricht treaty - would probably be
adopted by EU finance ministers in Brussels on Monday.
The guidelines are a diluted version of the original proposal but Mr
Christophersen said they would still be used 'as a basis for the examination
of the (economic) performance of member states'.
The French difficulties concern the wording on wage restraint - France and
others believe they should be tougher - and binding commitments to the EU
budget limits agreed at last year's Edinburgh summit.
Finance ministers also discussed yesterday the practical work of the
European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of a European central bank,
which will supervise the second phase of Emu, beginning on January 1.
Officials said that European Union leaders were likely formally to endorse
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, a Hungarian-born Belgian, as first president of the
EMI before the summit ends tomorrow.
Mr Lamfalussy made clear he expected to be heavily involved in the
discussion of EU economic affairs, even though the EMI's statutory role is
mainly supervisory.
Germany and Britain have resisted suggestions by the Belgian presidency and
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, that the EMI's role should be
beefed up.
But Mr Lamfalussy is still likely to work closely with the finance
ministers, Belgian officials said yesterday. He will attend their meetings
when the preparations for Emu are discussed.
The first EMI board meeting is likely to take place on January 3, although
it will take a few months for a working secretariat to be established in
Frankfurt, where the EMI will be based.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said the Bundesbank would restrict
itself to providing technical help to establish the EMI. He added that
Germany would not be among those countries which would allow the EMI to
manage their monetary reserves during the second phase of Emu.
Mr Christophersen played down German opposition to a strong EMI. 'I think
they (the Germans) have been so keen to get it to Frankfurt .. because they
want it to be a real institution, with some influence,' he told journalists.
'Why in heaven have it in Frankfurt unless it has real powers?'
