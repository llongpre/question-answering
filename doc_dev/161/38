THE German government yesterday firmly denied a report that European
Community leaders have reached a secret agreement to base the new European
Monetary Institute, the core of the future European central bank, in
Frankfurt.
'This report is too good to be true,' said a German government spokesman.
'There has been no such agreement yet. We do not yet have the agreement of
all our partners.'
German officials made it clear they believe that Britain remains the only EC
member state opposed to Frankfurt, but they also recognise the political
difficulty for Mr John Major, the British prime minister, should the bank be
sited there.
There was considerable embarrassment in Bonn yesterday over the report,
confidently published by Handelsblatt, Germany's business newspaper, that
Frankfurt had won the battle for the EMI. They fear that, by reviving the
question just as the British parliamentary debate on Maastricht is coming to
its climax, British capitulation will be less likely.
The decision of EC heads of government on the location of the Monetary
Institute, which is supposed to be in operation by next January 1, merely
requires a country to be chosen. It will then be up to the government of
that country to choose the precise site - taking into account the views of
all member states.
Britain has strongly resisted Germany's equally firm determination to
promote Frankfurt, on the grounds that it could undermine the city of
London's position as Europe's main financial centre. The Bonn government
believes that only by siting the bank in Frankfurt, home of the German
Bundesbank, will sceptics - especially Germans  - be reassured that the new
institution will be as independent and stability-conscious as the German
central bank.
In any case, it is clear that negotiations have reached an end-game.
The negotiations are part of an elaborate division of the Euro-spoils which
involves more than a dozen new agencies and institutions. Each brings the
promise of jobs, prestige and a hole in taxpayers' wallets.
The European central bank is the most valuable prize. Other agencies include
Europol, a mini-European FBI which would replace Interpol, a European
environmental office, a European trade-mark office, a European drugs agency
and a European plant and vegetable office.
After the recent upheaval in the exchange rate mechanism, and amid popular
doubts in Germany about giving up the D-Mark, the Bonn government's claims
have grown stronger.
Uncertainty over Maastricht ratification has damaged market confidence in
European monetary union. The Belgian presidency of the EC is therefore
pressing for a deal on the EMI, possibly at a special summit in the autumn.
This would allow stage two of EMU to start on schedule on January 1 1994.
Another factor appears to be the race to succeed Mr Jacques Attali as
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Under an earlier deal, France won the EBRD presidency and the UK won
agreement to put the bank in London. The question now is whether Mr Attali's
high-rolling habits have made it impossible for a Frenchman to keep the
post.
Mr Henning Christopherson, EC commissioner for economics and a strong
candidate for the EBRD job, has let it be known there should be 'no more Sun
Kings'.
If the Danish-born Mr Christopherson wins the EBRD job, what will become of
Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France and a rumoured
front-runner for the post? The French are not saying; but some believe the
de Larosiere candidacy is actually an elaborate bluff to increase leverage
in negotiations on who should be the president of the EMI.
