BELGIUM opened its EC Presidency yesterday with a pledge to 'play by the
rules' of the Community and a warning that the difficulty of enlargement
negotiations had been underestimated.
The two statements by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister,
underlined a shift in priorities after two nationalist-minded presidencies
under Denmark and the UK, both of which pushed for speedy enlargement with
Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria.
Mr Dehaene, who shares a passion for federalism and football, listed
Belgium's priorities as giving life to the Maastricht treaty and
strengthening EC institutions, particularly the European Commission.
He also said he was favourable to holding an early EC summit in October,
assuming ratification was wrapped up in the UK and Germany. But a summit
required concrete decisions such as an agreement on the location of new EC
institutions, notably the European Monetary Institute.
The EMI is the precursor of the European Central Bank which will supervise
the putative single EC currency. The UK is blocking a deal under which the
EMI would go to Germany and some ministers are arguing that London's status
as an international financial centre should give it control of some of its
operations.
Mr Dehaene warned that failure to reach a deal on the EMI could jeopardise
the second stage of European Monetary Union, due to begin on January 1,
1994. A delay could lead to a repeat of the monetary instability of the past
nine months which 'should be avoided at all costs,' he said.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President, said he was enthusiastic
about working with the Belgian Presidency. It was time to dispel the
Euro-gloom and recreate the successes of the mid-1980s, a period of dynamic
growth and job creation.
Mr Delors recalled that an acquaintance from Harvard University had recently
published an article suggesting that Europe was dead. But Americans had
written off Europe in the early 1980s, and had been proved wrong. The
Commission President, still hobbling from sciatica, said he intended to
finish his study on European competitiveness by the Brussels summit in
December.
