THE Belgian presidency of the EC, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president,
and European Community employers, yesterday threw their weight behind
existing plans for economic and monetary union.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, said the European Monetary
Institute - forerunner of a European central bank - should play a forceful
role in preparing for a single currency by 1999.
The EMI will begin its work on January 1, 1994, provided EC leaders can
decide on a site for the institution at their summit in Brussels on Friday.
Mr Delors also stressed the importance of the Emu objectives, and the role
of the EMI. In an interview for Belgian television, he said the EMI would
'round up the lost sheep (among EC economies), give new stability to a
relatively fixed exchange rate system, and lead to economic convergence'.
The currency turmoil of the last year has left the European monetary system
in disarray and recession has raised doubts about the original plans for
economic union. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, recently
dismissed the timetable for a single currency as 'folly'.
But Mr Maystadt, one of the EC's longest-serving finance ministers, said
yesterday that the Maastricht deadline of 1999 for monetary union was still
feasible, even if the more ambitious target of 1997 would be difficult to
achieve because of the EC's economic problems.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Maystadt also defended the
nomination of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy as the first president of the EMI. The
choice should be confirmed by EC leaders on Friday. Mr Maystadt said Mr
Lamfalussy, Belgian general manager of the Bank for International
Settlements in Basle, would give a new impetus to the Maastricht aims. 'We
know that Mr Lamfalussy is really convinced of the need for Europe to go to
a single currency: he's a true believer in the single currency and that's
not the case with all the bank governors.'
He said the EMI would be 'a more permanent and more objective supervisory
body for the European monetary system' than existing inter-governmental
bodies like the secretive EC monetary committee. Unice, which represents EC
employers' federations, also called for EC leaders to refocus on the Emu
objectives. 'We think that the single market without a stable monetary
relationship will be very difficult to sustain,' said Mr Carlos Ferrer,
Unice's president.
