  [Text] As briefly announced in yesterday's EUROPE (page 6), 
the Council of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), met on 
Tuesday [11 January] -- for the first time since the EMI came 
into existence on 1 January -- with Mr. Alexandre Lamfalussy 
chairing the proceedings held in Frankfurt municipal buildings. 
The Council appointed Maurice F. Doyle, Governor of Ireland's 
central bank, as vice-president and adopted various provisions 
related to the EMI organizational framework and functioning. In 
contrast, no decision was taken on the building that will house 
the Institute (and later the European Central Bank) on a 
permanent basis. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. 
Lamfalussy reviewed a number of aspects concerning the work of 
the EMI and European Monetary Union [EMU] in general, as follows: 
  - election of Mr. Doyle. Mr. Lamfalussy said he was happy to 
announce this appointment because Mr. Doyle is a "heavyweight" 
who enjoys a far-reaching reputation among professionals. The 
EMI president underscored Ireland's remarkable macro-economic 
results in recent years, "due in large measure to monetary 
management of the country," before going on to stress the 
"absolutely substantial" role played by Mr. Doyle in this 
context. As Ireland remains a relatively poor country, it also 
is particularly sensitive in various areas; 
  - EMI offices. The two buildings mentioned most often 
(namely, Posseidon-Haus and Messeturm) "are not the only ones" 
in the running. "I am still receiving and reviewing other 
proposals and I do not think a final decision can be taken 
before the next Council meeting." Mr. Lamfalussy will try to 
submit a proposal at this next meeting. This delay is related 
to the EMI's very specific needs as it is a "foreign 
institution" with extremely frequent meetings. The final choice 
will also have to take account of concerns to limit the costs of 
the operation as much as possible. This first meeting was held 
in Frankfurt for purely symbolic reasons, "to show the entire 
world that we respect the choice of Frankfurt," said Mr. 
Lamfalussy. He then said this location close to the Bundesbank 
would in no way change the Institute's relations with German 
monetary authorities. "I will not accept a greater Bundesbank 
influence on our work due to the fact that I will be in 
Frankfurt than I would if I were on a mountaintop elsewhere," he 
commented; 
  - transitional period. A period of "probably six months" was 
agreed, during which the work of the Committee of Governors of 
central banks will continue as in the past (this committee 
ceased to exist with the start of the second stage of EMU) 
pending the recruitment of appropriate personnel. Recruitment 
is expected to be concluded next summer and should coincide with 
the EMI's move into its definitive location in Frankfurt. Until 
then, the main staff members the EMI inherited from the former 
Committee of Governors will continue working under Mr. 
Lamfalussy's command in Basel, where meetings of the EMI Council 
will also take place during the transitional period. 
"Obviously, once the decision on the building has been taken, 
we will transfer more staff members to Frankfurt with a view to 
preparing the Institute's move," he added; 
  - decisions of an organizational nature. These concern 
fixing the pay of six EMI "key officials" (who will have a grade 
equivalent to director at the European Commission), making it 
possible to hire the appropriate individuals for these key 
posts. These include the director general (a post for which Mr. 
Lamfalussy intends to propose a candidate at the next Council 
meeting), and five heads of departments for the following 
sectors: economic and statistics unit, secretariat general, 
administrative service, information systems and financial unit 
(essentially responsible for managing the monetary reserves of 
the national banks wishing to deposit them with the EMI). At 
the end of 1994, the EMI is expected to have around 140 
employees, a number that could rise to 250 once it is fully 
operational. Answering questions, Mr. Lamfalussy added the 
following information: 
  - the single currency from 1997 "seems an unrealistic 
perspective for the moment" (he declined to make any projections 
about achieving this objective in 1999). Meanwhile, the EMI 
president can nevertheless imagine other sorts of arrangements 
between member states, such as those concluded in August 1993 
between Germany and the Netherlands to maintain a stable link 
between the Deutsche mark and the guilder; 
  - asked about Mr. Delors' recent statement that the first 
stage of EMU was a failure and that study should begin on how to 
boost the second stage, possibly by giving the EMI greater 
responsibilities, Mr. Lamfalussy voiced some reluctance 
regarding an expansion of the EMI's powers even before he has 
begun to work on the basis of existing prerogatives. Moreover, 
he added, unquestionable progress (though still "too slow") has 
been made in the last five years in several areas aiming at 
improving convergence between the member states (to curb 
inflation, in particular) and several currencies have moved 
closer in recent months to the initial fluctuation bands of the 
EMS, which proves that an attitude of "common interest" is 
developing and is promising for the future; 
  - despite the difficulties currently facing the EMS, the 
single currency objective will one day become a reality because 
"with the extremely high degree of economic integration in 
Europe, I cannot imagine that it could eventually function 
correctly without a single currency." For now, it is still 
premature to say what states will take this step, when and under 
what circumstances, "but I am absolutely convinced that the 
process will lead to this specific objective;" 
  - outside of France, which during the negotiation of 
Maastricht raised the possibility of depositing currency 
reserves with the EMI (as provided in the protocol of the EMI 
statutes, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht), up to now no 
central bank has requested the Institute to manage its monetary 
reserves, said Mr. Lamfalussy. This is due to "practical 
reasons," in his view, because it is a highly specialized task 
that must be carried out with great caution and which 
necessitates a "major technological investment." The EMI will 
be prepared to set in place such capacity "as soon as we have 
the impression there is a real demand along these lines".
