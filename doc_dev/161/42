EU finance ministers yesterday left open the door for a move to a single
European currency in 1997 with a carefully-couched endorsement of the
current wide fluctuation bands in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The 1997 date for the creation of a monetary union in Europe is still viewed
as a remote possibility only, but the decision in Brussels yesterday
underlined political commitment to the Emu project.
The 15 per cent fluctuation bands were introduced as a temporary measure
after the currency crisis in 1992-93 which forced several devaluations and
the departure of sterling and the lira from the ERM. The wider bands have so
far helped to deter similar speculative assaults.
In a joint statement yesterday, EU finance ministers studiously avoided
declaring that the present arrangements were 'normal'. One of the key
provisions of the Maastricht treaty is that a currency seeking to join Emu
must have been inside its so-called normal bands for at least two years.
Instead, ministers agreed to endorse an opinion on the wide bands drawn up
by the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the future European
central bank which is supposed to supervise the single currency.
The EMI noted that the wider bands had prevented big exchange rate
depreciations and excessive exchange rate intervention with their
potentially inflationary consequences. 'In the light of this experience and
in the current circumstances, the EMI council considers it advisable to
maintain the present arrangements.'
Mr Waigel resolutely refused to say whether the 15 per cent bands would
continue right up to the point of a decision on whether to move to a single
currency, or whether ministers would support a progressive narrowing of the
bands.
Instead, he reaffirmed the need for price stability and sound public
finances which would avoid exchange rate stability. The August 1993 decision
to suspend intervention obligations and introduce 15 per cent fluctuation
bands had succeeded, he said.
The other important criteria for moving to a single currency are that
government budget deficits fall to 3 per cent or less of gross domestic
product, and that government debt falls consistently towards a target of 60
per cent of GDP.
Though 1997 remains a highly ambitious target, many observers are
reassessing the possibility of a move by a privileged few currencies led by
the D-Mark to monetary union in 1999. However, public opinion in France,
Germany and the UK among the main European economies remains divided.
The European Commission pressed for a statement on the wide bands to keep
hopes alive that the 1997 date for Emu could be met, arguing that it was
important not weaken the provisions of the Maastricht treaty.
