  [Text] Frankfurt, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The European Monetary 
Institute held its first meeting Tuesday afternoon [11 January] 
in Frankfurt on what is expected to be a rocky journey to 
creation of a European central bank, with an initial team of 30 
banking pioneers. 
  At a news conference after the meeting, institute president 
Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium emphasizerd the breadth of the 
task awaiting his small team. And he said that the EMI status, 
resulting from the European Community's Maastricht Treaty, does 
not facilitate the new agency's task, as it is too "ambiguous." 
  The main difficulty lies in the fact that control of 
monetary 
policies remains in the national central banks' hands, he 
commented. But over time, the institute is to work out the 
technical procedures for putting the European Community's 
planned single currency into effect and prepare for installation 
of the future European Central Bank, he noted. 
  One of the key tasks given to the institute under the 
Maastricht treaty for European economic and monetary union (EMU) 
is preparation of banknotes denominated in ECUs [European 
Currency Unit]. 
  The institute also has authority to make recommendations, 
but 
not give instructions, to members of the European Community on 
monetary policy, exchange policy and associated matters. 
  The institute is expected to tighten cooperation among EC 
central banks and coordinate monetary policies. But it has no 
monetary powers, and in December, German secretary of state for 
finance Gerd Haller said that the German Government would not 
tolerate any action which exceeded the institute's powers. 
  Responsibility for monetary policy remains in the member 
states' hands during the second phase of EMU, as Bundesbank 
chief Hans Tietmeyer has emphasized many times, and he has also 
said that "entering the third phase is unlikely at the end of 
1996." 
  Last week the French Government gave the Bank of France 
independence in setting monetary policy but stressed that the 
government remained responsible for exchange rate policy and the 
franc's exchange rate, and that the central bank had to take 
account of overall economic policy. 
  The forced exit of sterling and the lira from the European 
Monetary System (EMS) in September 1992 and the European 
monetary crisis of last July, leading to a vast widening of the 
EMS currency fluctuation margins, were a serious blow to the 
credibility of the Maastricht monetary programme. 
  The EMI, the forerunner of a fully-independent European 
central bank, is part of a complex framework of measures to 
force national economies within the European Community to 
converge to enable the community to adopt a common currency by 
2000. 
  Actually, no Community member now meets the criteria laid 
down in the Maastricht Treaty for entering the third phase of 
EMU. 
  A big institute asset is Lamfalussy, previously managing 
director of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. He 
is universally praised for his serious approach, knowledge of 
monetary questions, and feeling for diplomacy. 
  Thanks to his "neutral" position, he might act as arbitrator 
in conflicts sure to arise in installing the single currency, or 
before a possible devaluation of an EMS currency, banking 
sources say.
