FT  03 AUG 93 / ERM crisis vindicates UK monetary policy, says Major

THE MAASTRICHT timetable for European monetary union is now 'totally
unrealistic', Mr John Major said yesterday, as he claimed that the emergency
steps taken to salvage the exchange rate mechanism vindicated his decision
to suspend sterling's membership last September.
As government loyalists and Euro-sceptics alike sought to draw comfort from
the day's events, which also saw Britain become the eleventh European
Community state to ratify Maastricht, the prime minister said he hoped the
decision to allow wider fluctuation of currencies within the ERM would
promote economic recovery in Europe.
In the timetable, if a commencement date for stage three of monetary union
has not been set by the end of 1997, then Emu must in any case go ahead by
January 1999.
In a remark later played down by Downing Street, Mr Major appeared to hold
out the prospect that the changes could herald lower domestic interest
rates.
There remained 'no prospect' of Britain returning to the ERM 'in the near
future', he said. The government would continue to set monetary policy by
'what's right for the United Kingdom'.
But as senior ministers trumpeted the message that recent developments
justified the government's European policy, their thunder was partly stolen
by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who predicted there would be no
single European currency and described Maastricht as 'a bit of a fossil'.
Tory Euro-sceptics, meanwhile, pointed to the 'supreme irony' of Britain
ratifying Maastricht on the day the ERM collapsed.
Downing Street emphasised that 'relative currency stability' remained a
desirable objective and looked ahead to a process of examining why the old
system did not work and how existing fault-lines could be eradicated.
It pinned the blame for the system's difficulties squarely on the strains
resulting from German reunification. It indicated that an autumn summit of
member states to discuss possible solutions was likely.
In his forthright reaction to the decision to create a 15 per cent
fluctuation band for all ERM currencies except the D-Mark and the guilder,
Mr Lamont said: 'This does mean the end of a single currency, the end of
monetary union in Europe. This makes the Maastricht treaty redundant.'
It was 'extraordinary that we have spent so much time constructing this
artificial creation and, frankly, it has gone out of the window', he said.
