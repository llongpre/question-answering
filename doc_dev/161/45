BRITAIN appears ready to drop its claim to base the European Monetary
Institute, the core of the future European central bank, in London.
The pending shift would clear the way for a deal at the European Community
summit on October 29 to locate the EMI in Germany which has recently stepped
up its campaign in favour of Frankfurt.
Officials in Brussels said the UK government's readiness to soften its
position reflects a tactical calculation that it is no longer worth fighting
a losing cause against German claims which are supported by the rest of the
Community.
The same officials said the UK government also appeared to have been
influenced by the faltering momentum behind the EC's goal of economic and
monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty - a view summed up by Mr
John Major's recent comment that plans for Emu had 'all the quaintness of a
rain dance and about the same potency'.
The British prime minister's statement caused irritation in Brussels, where
the European Commission is trying hard to build up the EMI as an embryonic
European central bank ready to start business on January 1, 1994, under the
so-called stage two of Emu.
EC finance ministers, who are holding informal talks in Genval, near
Brussels, will today hear details of legislation regarding the operation of
the EMI from Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner.
The legislation bans governments from borrowing indirectly from central
banks; bars privileged access by governments to financial institutions;
encourages governments to rein in excessive budget deficits and debt, and
sets out the various contributions of central banks towards financing the
institute.
It must be given a favourable opinion by the European parliament by the end
of the year to go into effect by January 1, 1994.
Mr Christophersen is said to be determined that the EMI will not be 'a
shell'. He believes that it could serve to draw member states and central
banks into a more formal system of monetary and macroeconomic co-operation.
Last night, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, gave a
presentation to finance ministers on the economic outlook in the Community
as well as his thoughts on jobs, growth and competitiveness. These are to be
combined in a White Paper to be submitted to the EC summit in Brussels in
December.
At the Genval meeting, ministers will also have a broad discussion on the
lessons of the August 2 currency crisis which led to the virtual collapse of
the exchange rate mechanism. However, diplomats cautioned that it was 'too
early' to expect any conclusions or decisions.
