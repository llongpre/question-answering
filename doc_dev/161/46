margins need not disrupt integration

THE BUNDESBANK said yesterday that the new wide margins of fluctuation
within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System need not
disrupt the process of monetary integration in Europe.
The German central bank said the second stage of European monetary union
would still come into force by next January 1, in line with the Maastricht
treaty.
It left uncertain, however, the future timetable towards a single currency,
saying 'the further steps on the road to economic and monetary union will .
. . hinge crucially on whether, and how soon, the economic and political
prerequisites for a common currency can be fulfilled'.
In a staunch defence of its own actions, published in its latest monthly
bulletin, the Bundesbank said its credibility had been 'hardened' by its
proven independence, and its absolute priority for an anti-inflationary
monetary policy, in recent weeks.
The article gave no hint of remorse for the stern monetary policy which
precipitated the latest ERM crisis.
It said the system had become vulnerable to massive speculation because the
limits to exchange rate stabilisation had become clear.
The Bundesbank bought EMS partner currencies equivalent to almost DM60bn
(Dollars 34.80bn) in July - mostly French francs. Purchases on July 30, when
the Danish krone also fell to its lower intervention point, totalled almost
DM30bn.
While it agreed that the new broad currency bands in the ERM would offer
Germany's EC partners greater latitude for a monetary policy independent of
its own, the bank warned they must 'exploit this monetary policy scope with
circum-spection'.
From an all-European point of view, the temporary widening of the margins of
fluctuation in the EMS is not to be regarded as a relapse into less orderly
monetary conditions.
'As long as member states' monetary policy makers abide by the medium-term
objectives for price stability, and neither succumb to the temptation of
economic policy hyperactivity, nor aim at gaining short-term competitive
advantages, the preconditions for exchange rate stability remain in place.
'By the latest monetary policy measures, the authorities have succeeded in
preserving in principle the rules of the EMS. Owing to the greater
flexibility in the operation of these rules, potential tensions have been
lessened at the same time, and thus a major contribution has been made to
containing intervention volumes.'
The analysis of the ERM crisis puts the long-term blame on the premature
effort to operate a system of unchanged parities.
