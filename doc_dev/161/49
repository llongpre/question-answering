  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- In the run-up to 
establishing the European Monetary Institute (EMI) in 
Frankfurt/Main on 11 January, Gerd Haller, state secretary at 
the Finance Ministry, underscored the political framework for 
the EMI's activity. Haller stressed today on Hesse Radio that 
"from a German viewpoint there is absolutely no question" that 
the Bundesbank's monetary policy "will be influenced in some 
way" via the EMI. The state secretary said that one essential 
function of the EMI will be to coordinate monetary policy 
between the member states in keeping with a policy of stability, 
without detriment to the autonomy of the member states. He 
stressed that the Bundesbank remains "entirely free" with regard 
to its monetary policy. Another function is the EMI's 
preparation of a common European currency for the third phase of 
monetary union, which will be realized in a few years' time. 
  Haller pointed out that the functions and competences of the 
EMI have been finally laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. "It 
goes without saying that we, and I believe the Bundesbank too, 
will not allow the Institute to go beyond the competences 
clearly outlined there," he stressed. 
  The state secretary expressed his lack of understanding for 
the stance otaken by Spain, Portugal, and Greece in wanting to 
exclude Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland -- the prospective 
newcomers to the European Union -- from the development of 
monetary union. "We cannot accept this demand from the German 
point of view." 
  It is important for Germany that monetary union is achieved. 
Open markets without monetary borders bring many advantages, 
said Haller, pointing out that many German jobs are dependent on 
exports.
