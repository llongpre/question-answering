It is, according to one old saw, better to travel hopefully than to arrive.
But as in so many things in life, the European Community is turning
conventional wisdom on its head. Increasingly, the transitional second stage
of economic and monetary union, which starts on January 1, is shaping up to
be an especially difficult venture with many incalculable problems.
By contrast, the third and final stage of Emu, with its planned single
currency and central bank, has been subject to so much analysis and
discussion over the past five years that its hazards, although real enough,
appear familiar and less daunting.
The second stage of Emu is supposed to pave the way for fully fledged
monetary union towards the end of the decade. In it, EC member states are to
strive for ever greater convergence of economic performance, particularly in
terms of price stability and sound public finance, and to step up policy
co-ordination.
Such far reaching changes are best attempted on a sound institutional basis
and against a favourable economic background. The past year's crises in the
European exchange rate mechanism and the continuing recession on the
continent mean neither condition applies at present. Compounding the
difficulties are policy inconsistencies, notably in France, and widely
divergent ideas among member states as to how far the EC should move down
the path of institutional integration in stage two.
With the community heading for yet another year of sub-optimal growth, the
economic background is especially bleak. Although Mr Henning Christophersen,
the EC's economic affairs commissioner, has suggested that EC growth could
be as high as 2 per cent next year, others are far less hopeful.
The commission's own forecasters have suggested that growth next year will
be about 0.9 per cent, largely because they believe Germany is heading for
another year of declining economic activity. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the
Belgian finance minister and current president of the EC economic and
finance ministers' council, noted last week that the commission was likely
to revise its growth forecasts upwards. But he added that many countries,
including Belgium, would not be following suit.
Low growth will make it more difficult for member states to control their
budget deficits and so will hamper progress towards meeting the Maastricht
Treaty's convergence criteria, which include a 60 per cent limit for the
ratio of government debt to gross domestic product.
In the absence of draconian public spending cuts, which would be politically
risky, public debt is bound to keep rising as a percentage of GDP in those
EC countries where economic growth rates are lower than real interest rates.
This condition applies in France and Belgium. In Belgium's case, where the
ratio of debt to GDP is around 130 per cent, the outlook is one of further
deterioration unless and until growth exceeds real interest rates. In spite
of last month's easing of Bundesbank monetary policy, that date is probably
some way off.
Doubts about convergence will make EC economies vulnerable to financial
market pressures in stage two. Belgium's debt problem has exposed its
currency the Belgian franc to selling pressure in recent weeks.
International investors have also been looking askance at other signs of
economic divergence that are not singled out in the Maastricht Treaty.
France's sharply rising unemployment rate was a key factor behind the loss
of confidence in the French franc ahead of the July and August currency
crisis that culminated in the widening of the ERM fluctuation bands to 15
per cent. Looking ahead, there is no early sign that French unemployment
will decline from its current 11.8 per cent level, while youth unemployment
at about twice that rate is especially disturbing.
The joint Franco-German convergence programme, unveiled on Tuesday, has
caused surprise among some European officials for its optimistic view that
French growth could be as much as 3.5 per cent after 1995. One non-official
view, expressed last week by Professor Christian de Boissieu of the Sorbonne
University in Paris, was that growth would be nearer 2.5 per cent.
As worrying to European monetary officials is an apparent lack of coherence
in French monetary policy. At a recent monetary conference in Amsterdam, Mr
Andre Icard, director general of research at the French central bank,
insisted that currency stability was the main plank of monetary policy, in
spite of the franc's decline against the D-Mark since August. But he also
said France would pay more attention to the M3 money supply measure than in
the past.
Those who took his remarks at face value were left wondering how the Bank of
France would react to conflicting signals from its chosen indicators. Others
concluded that France's current monetary policy was to shadow German
interest rates.
According to Mr Maystadt, the planned European Monetary Institute, which is
due to begin operating in Frankfurt in January, is the ideal institution to
iron out such wrinkles and demonstrate consistency of decisions among
national central banks in the run up to stage three.
But that presupposes that EC member states will have achieved a consensus on
what the EMI should do and on the technicalities and instruments of an
eventual Europe-wide monetary policy.
Although discussion on the role and functions of the EMI is just beginning,
it is already clear that there are wide divergences between authorities such
as the Belgian finance ministry that see it as an instrument to force
integration and the Bank of England and Bundesbank which think its role
should be mainly advisory.
It is too early to predict that the problems of stage two will prove so
great as to jeopardise the goal of monetary union. But they are much greater
than when the Maastricht Treaty was signed in February 1992 and throw an
unflattering light on the EC's habit of setting deadlines for policy change
without regard to economic developments.
