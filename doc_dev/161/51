MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, admitted last night that strict
insistence on economic convergence between EC member states could delay
creation of a single European currency 'by a year or two,' but he said the
ultimate objective would be unaffected.
The timetable of European economic and monetary union would be discussed at
the special EC summit planned for October, he said in an interview on SAT-1,
a German television station.
A decision on the location of the future European monetary institute - the
forerunner of the planned European central bank - would also be taken at
that summit, which is intended to mark the final ratification of the
Maastricht treaty.
The chancellor staunchly defended the actions of the Bundesbank and the
German government during the recent European currency crisis, saying Germany
had yet again proved its firm commitment to European co-operation. 'The
Bundesbank fulfilled its obligations fully and without any hesitation, fully
supported by the German government,' he said.
'The close and good co-operation between Bundesbank and government proved
its worth, especially in recent days.'
The decision to relax the margins of currency fluctuation within the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System was 'not a decision
against Maastricht', he insisted.
However, he agreed that the timetable of economic and monetary union would
have to be discussed by the EC heads of government at the special October
summit.
In a firm reiteration of his commitment to European integ-ration, Mr Kohl
repeated Germany's insistence that the strict economic convergence criteria
 -including limits on government indebtedness, budget deficits, and
inflation - must be maintained.
'We must on no account ease the very strict conditions for national
economies,' he said. 'If this has the consequence . . . that the timetable
now envisaged is delayed by a year or two, then I would simply ask: how does
that change the basic course?'
The decisive thing, he said, was that a united Europe would be built in this
decade, something which had been unimaginable for the previous 90 years of
the century - a Europe in which individual peoples, such as the Germans and
French, would still maintain their national identity, but under a single
'European roof'.
Mr Kohl said recent upheavals in the EMS were 'nothing new'. The problem was
that they were compounded by the international recession, which was a
structural crisis in the world economy. EC member states had also failed to
bring their budget deficits under control.
He expressed surprise that the French government had proposed the temporary
withdrawal of the D-Mark from the ERM during negotiations. He said he told
the French that other EC member states would object, 'and that is what
happened'. There was no German 'plot' against France.
Mr Kohl repeated that Germany was the obvious choice for the site of the
EMI, in spite of the 'reluctance' of one or more member states, in a clear
reference to British opposition. He was 'quite optimistic' that the German
battle to have the institute in Frankfurt would win in the end.
