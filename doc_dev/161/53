The Bundesbank's president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, has ruled out transferring
any of its currency reserves to the newly-established European Monetary
Institute.
Speaking at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, he
stressed that the EMI would have only an advisory role throughout the
so-called phase two of the process towards European monetary union.
Responsibility for monetary policy would remain in the hands of member
country central banks.
He pointed out that, according to the Maastricht treaty, important decisions
of the EMI during this period would have to be unanimous.
The treaty permitted central banks to transfer reserves to the EMI, but Mr
Tietmeyer said he had not heard of any country willing to do so. 'The
Bundesbank will not do this. We feel we are equipped to manage our reserves
in the appropriate way. Of course this will change when we move into the
situation of a European central bank.'
He also cautioned the EMI against promoting the Ecu as a currency. 'The
EMI's task is to facilitate but not to promote the Ecu. The Ecu is not a
currency, it is a basket, and there are exchange risks in it during phase
two.'
The EMI, which is to be located in Frankfurt, began work on January 1 and
has the task of preparing the ground for eventual monetary union, due in
1999. Mr Tietmeyer said he did not believe lasting monetary union could be
achieved without a parallel political union of EU countries.
He said numerous issues connected with monetary union still had to be
resolved, including what the main policy aims of a European central bank
should be. While the Bundesbank set priority on money supply targets, the
Bank of England stressed price stability, and other countries pursued
exchange rate policies, he said.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said the EMI's most
important task was to prepare the ground for monetary union, seeking
solutions to technical obstacles in member countries and promoting
standardisation of statistics.
