The European Union could disintegrate if it takes in new members before
deepening monetary and political ties in a core group of the existing 12
members, according to Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president.
Mr Tietmeyer, picking up the theme of a multi-track, multi-speed Europe,
warns today in the German newspaper Handelsblatt that the Union will fall
apart if progress towards monetary and political union is oriented towards
the 'slowest ship'.
Spelling out what a multi-speed Europe might look like, Mr Tietmeyer said it
was unlikely a majority of EU countries would fulfil the convergence
criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty by 1997.
'But stability is more important than the timetable,' he insisted, saying
that whether the union took effect in 1997 or 2000 was not the decisive
factor.
His hard-hitting remarks amplify the Bundesbank's view that monetary union
is appropriate only for a core group of countries which fulfil the
anti-inflation criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty.
His remarks also lend support to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the German leader,
who is in favour of a core group of countries pressing ahead with further
integration.
'A monetary union represents a long-term community of solidarity and risk,
which requires a corresponding long-term political union,' Mr Tietmeyer
said.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, echoed Mr Tietmeyer's view
that convergence was the priority. In a London speech at the weekend he said
convergence was the first concern and that an early move to a single
European currency would be a mistake.
'However appealing the vision of a single currency may be . . . the
absolutely essential prior economic condition is to establish sustainable
convergence, based on an underlying stability in the participating member
states,' Mr George said. 'I believe that we have a long way to go before
that necessary pre-condition will be met.'
The remarks of the two central bankers comes against the backdrop of a
sustained period of exchange rate stability within the European Monetary
System, following the substantial widening of the fluctuation margins last
August.
Mr Tietmeyer did not specify when he thought monetary union could be
achieved by the 12 existing states. He also failed to indicate which
countries he thought might be able to move more quickly to the first stage
of monetary union.
However, it is the Benelux countries, Germany and France that have achieved
most, so far, in co-ordinating interest rate policy and establishing
exchange rate stability, although it is only Luxembourg that fully meets the
tough convergence criteria.
Mr Tietmeyer's remarks represent an implicit rebuke to those who believe the
union can simply take in new applicants, in particular from eastern Europe,
without first deepening integration among the 12.
The EU had to to become deeper - in terms of closer co-operation between the
core member-states - at the same time as it became broader, Mr Tietmeyer
said.
