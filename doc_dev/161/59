THE European Commission in Brussels was jubilant last night as news of the
first exit poll indicated a comfortable majority for ratification.
'The treaty will certainly go through now,' smiled one of the Commission's
top civil servants, who said he expected the Maastricht treaty to be in
place by September 1.
Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner for external political affairs,
described the outcome as 'an important day for Europe' and said 'we are
looking with high expectations towards London' for the British House of
Commons to complete its ratification of the treaty.
Sir Leon Brittan, the British commissioner for external economic affairs,
expected the Danish vote to give Mr John Major's government a strong boost
in getting the Maastricht bill through.
'The Danes have decided after long and detailed analysis that the Maastricht
treaty, far from forcing them down the road to an over-centralised and
bureaucratic union, will strengthen ties between European nations without
threatening their identity,' Sir Leon said.
'This conclusion is as relevant for Britain as it is for Denmark,' he added,
'and it will substantially boost the British ratification process.'
Officials dismissed the possibility of a treaty upset in Germany, where
although both houses of parliament have ratified Maastricht, it is being
challenged on constitutional grounds in the courts.
Officials from Norway and Austria, which along with Sweden and Finland are
negotiating entry to the EC, were also mightily relieved and hopeful that
the change of heart among Danish voters would boost waning Euro-enthusiasm
in their own countries. A No in Denmark would have scuttled their
negotiations.
Several commissioners emphasised that Brussels and the Community could now
get back to work after nearly a year of internal wrangles.
Mr Henning Christopherson, the Danish commissioner in charge of economic
affairs, stressed the need to get on with the second stage of economic and
monetary union (Emu), due to start next year with the creation of the
European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of an eventual European central
bank.
Mr Christopherson insisted that Emu and a single currency was still a viable
goal by its earliest date in 1997. 'I still believe that a majority of the
member states could meet the (fiscal and monetary convergence) criteria,' Mr
Christopherson said. 'A lot can be done within the next three to four
years,' he added.
