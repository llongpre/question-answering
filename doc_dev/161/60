MR John Major, the prime minister, yesterday entered the debate over the
future of European monetary union by reviving his proposal for a 'hard Ecu'
currency unit to trade alongside Europe's national currencies.
A spokesman for Mr Major said a proposal for a hard Ecu would be considered
as 'one of a number of options' for improving economic co-operation in the
European Community.
The move appears designed to ensure that the recent turmoil in Europe's
exchange rate mechanism does not trigger an attempt by an inner core of EC
states to accelerate progress towards monetary union.
During negotiations on the Maastricht treaty in 1991, Mr Major lobbied
strongly for the hard Ecu concept as an alternative route towards European
monetary union. The idea was rejected by Britain's EC partners. But last
weekend's agreement to widen the fluctuation bands for most ERM currencies
has raised strong doubts about whether the current Maastricht plan for Emu
remains valid.
There was no reaction to the proposal from European officials yesterday. But
the finance ministers of France and Germany reiterated their confidence that
the existing timetable for Emu was valid and that the ERM could return to
narrow bands in the near future.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, told German television that the
widening of the ERM bands did not compromise the move to stage two of the
Maastricht treaty at the start of 1994, which involves the setting up of a
European Monetary Institute to act as a model for an EC central bank.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, his French counterpart, commented: 'People have
underestimated the strength of our collective European commitment.'
The credibility of the ERM may be tested again this week as France, Denmark
and Belgium continue to keep their currencies closely tied to the D-Mark by
maintaining overnight interest rates in their domestic money markets at very
high levels. Some dealers believe the high interest rate policy will not be
sustainable because of high unemployment.
Senior Tories have continued to bicker over Europe in the wake of the ERM
crisis. But there was immediate support for the hard Ecu from Mr Norman
Lamont, the former chancellor, who told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend
that the idea was 'attractive'.
However, Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, told BBC TV's
Breakfast With Frost he did not think it would work. However, he thought the
timetable for monetary union set out by Maastricht was 'too slow.'
The hard Ecu project envisages the launch of a pan-European currency which
would keep pace with the strongest European currency at all times. If the
new currency became popular, it would gradually replace national currencies
as legal tender. If not, it would be allowed to die.
However, economists were sceptical as to whether Britain's EC partners would
adopt the idea. Mr Brian Hilliard of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said
the project would involve considerable costs because central banks would
have to pledge to buy the Ecu in exchange for Europe's strongest currency.
