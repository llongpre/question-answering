remain in place for foreseeable future

THERE WILL be no early return to the old European exchange rate mechanism
European Community finance ministers agreed after two days of talks this
weekend.
The talks among EC ministers, central bank governors and top Treasury
officials ended with a consensus that the wider fluctuation bands in the ERM
will remain in place for the foreseeable future.
The agreement that the old ERM will remain unworkable for a time was the
main conclusion of a two-day assessment of the consequences of the August 2
European currency crisis.
That led to the de facto suspension of the ERM through the introduction of
15 per cent currency fluctuation bands.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, warned ministers meeting in
Genval, near Brussels, that the European economy faced low growth and high
unemployment until 1996. Although Europe remained capable of a strong
rebound, a recovery depended on a fall in EC interest rates, lower
employment costs and a stronger dollar.
The sober outlook for the EC economies emerged along with signs that the
European Commission has abandoned hopes that a 'hard core' of currencies
built around the D-Mark might be ready for economic and monetary union by
1997.
The ministers, central bank governors and senior Treasury officials rallied
behind the goal of greater economic 'convergence' on inflation, budget
deficits and interest rates as the precondition for a single European
currency.
But the UK, France and Germany resisted efforts by the Commission to set
specific performance targets to measure the success of their efforts to
return to convergence.
The 'Big Three' told Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner,
that they could support only general guidelines on convergence at the EC
summit in Brussels in December.
Their resistance set back hopes in Brussels that the Commission might be
able to use the impending ratification of the Maastricht treaty to draw
member states into a more formal co-operation on macro-economic policy.
Ministers appeared anxious to avoid the recrimination that has bedevilled
relations in the past 12 months, and steered clear of earlier suggestions
that capital controls should be considered as a means of strengthening the
ERM against speculators.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, said he was still
convinced of the need to reinforce the ERM. 'But we also think there are
some preconditions to be met before we talk of a return to narrow margins,
and one of those is greater convergence.'
In an effort to shore up the credibility of the Emu project, ministers
expressed support for the introduction by the end of the year of the
national legislation for Emu to take effect.
The legislation would allow Emu 'stage two' to begin on time on January 1
1994; and it would create the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of
the European central bank.
The legislation would ban governments from borrowing indirectly from central
banks; bar privileged access by governments to financial institutions;
encourage governments to rein in excessive budget deficits and debt; and set
out the various contributions of central banks to the EMI.
