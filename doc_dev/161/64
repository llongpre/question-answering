FT  21 JUN 93 / ERM should be reorganised

The European exchange rate mechanism should be reorganised with wider
currency fluctuation bands so that members can have scope to follow
differing monetary and fiscal policies, a British bank economist has
suggested, Peter Norman writes.
Mr Patrick Foley, chief economic adviser at Lloyds Bank, said ERM countries
would be better able to achieve economic convergence if exchange rate bands
were widened to perhaps 10 per cent either side of their central rates, from
the present 2.25 per cent.
The planned European Monetary Institute (EMI) should be given the task of
determining central rates in the new wider bands by assessing underlying
economic fundamentals in the ERM countries, he said. The EMI, which is due
to have a co-ordinating role for monetary policy when stage two of the
Maastricht plan for economic and monetary union begins in January, could
also orchestrate regular 'inflation realignments' to keep real exchange
rates in the ERM relatively constant.
Mr Foley's proposals would change the ERM into a 'crawling peg' currency
system from one of fixed but adjustable exchange rates.
