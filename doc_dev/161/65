   Efforts to achieve economic and monetary union
within the European Community hit a snag Saturday in disagreements
among the 12 member states over when and how union should be
accomplished.
   At a one-day session, the EC finance ministers reached no accord
on a timetable for moving toward a single currency and central bank
patterned after the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   They met with only three months before the final negotiations on
monetary union are to take place. The ministers agreed to meet
again here in November.
   The final talks, due to open in December, must produce
amendments to the EC's 1957 founding Treaty of Rome to bring about
monetary union.
   The meeting was a boost for British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who opposes a single EC currency and an EC central bank.
Some EC nations have expressed support Britain's alternative
proposals for monetary union.
   Supporters of a single currency and a central bank _ notably
France, Belgium and Italy _ had hoped Saturday's meeting would put
the final touches on preparatory work for the start of the December
talks.
   The EC's drive for monetary union is a complex, three-stage
journey.
   The first stage began July 1 and the EC nations now are more
closely coordinating their economic and monetary policies.
   Also, all EC currencies, notably the British pound, will join
the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism. The pound,
the Greek drachma and the Portuguese escudo are not in the ERM now.
   On Saturday, several nations rejected a proposal by the EC
executive Commission that the second stage _ during which the EC
would create a central bank _ begin on Jan. 1, 1993.
   West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, and Portugal argued that
before the second stage begins, the EC nations must first narrow
the gaps between their inflation, unemployment and interest rates.
   ``There was a long discussion about the moment at which you must
go to phase two. There are difficulties there,'' said Dutch Finance
Minister Wim Kok.
   Under the EC Commission's proposal, in the third and final stage
of monetary union the nations would permanently fix exchange rates
among their currencies. These eventually would be replaced by a
single currency known as the ``European currency unit,'' or ECU.
   Spanish Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga Saturday proposed that
a single currency not be created until the year 2000.
   He described his proposal as a compromise between Britain _
which prefers the retain the 12 EC currencies plus a ``hard ECU'' _
and the EC Commission's monetary package.
   But Solchaga's plan ran into opposition from West German Central
Bank President Karl Otto Poehl, who said, ``I am very much against
it. I cannot see many merits'' in a parallel currency.
