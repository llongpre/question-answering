FT  17 FEB 93 / Europe keeps on tortuous path towards Emu: The latest
finance ministers' meeting, 'a kind of intellectual warming-up exercise for
monetary union'

THE meeting on Monday of European Community finance ministers in Brussels
began innocuously enough. First a two-hour TV debate on the European
economy, enlivened only by Irish complaints about the Community's failure to
prevent the devaluation of the punt; and then the usual retreat behind
closed doors.
What followed remains open to interpretation. By some accounts, the
decisions adopted reveal the first public signs that the Maastricht treaty's
timetable for European Monetary Union was slipping. Others inside the
European Commission argue that nothing has changed. Some Emu enthusiasts
even suggest that an early push for monetary union is now more likely than
ever.
The debate centres on the significance of the finance ministers' decision to
accept the European Commission's request to prolong member states' existing
economic 'convergence' programmes to 1996 and to set common standards for
measuring these economic performance targets. Convergence programmes are the
rigorous action plans which aim to reduce inflation, budget deficits and
government debt so that member states economies' 'converge' and qualify as
members of a future Emu club.
Paradoxically, these convergence plans began as an Italian initiative with
no direct relationship to the Emu project. Italy wanted to use
Brussels-approved targets as an external political discipline to justify
unpopular economic belt-tightening at home. Seven EC members followed, each
presenting differing, often contradictory, programmes with varying
timetables (see table). 'It was all very haphazard,' says a senior EC
official, 'a kind of intellectual warming-up exercise for monetary union.'
To be eligible for Emu, a country has under the Maastricht provisions to cut
its government budget deficit to no more than 3 per cent of annual economic
output and government debt to no more than 60 per cent of annual output - or
at least persuade fellow member states it has a realistic chance of meeting
these conditions in future.
Emu enthusiasts argue that extending convergence programmes to 1996 is
important since it gives Germany an extra year to cope with the huge costs
of unification. Germany is in the embarrassing position of not meeting Emu
performance targets for inflation or budget deficits - though it could
reasonably expect to do so after the medium-term tax package planned to
begin in 1995. One EC official said: 'Without Germany, there is no Emu.'
Emu sceptics believe extension of the convergence programme to 1996 and
beyond is a smokescreen, obscuring the fact that a deeper-than-expected
recession means that the convergence criteria are no longer realistic. At
Monday's meeting, there were clear signs of unrest as finance ministers
wrestled with two conflicting aims: the need to pursue deflationary
convergence programmes as well as to fight unemployment and head off what
one senior Italian diplomat described as the risk of people rioting in the
streets.
Fears that the price of monetary union may be too high are not new. Mr
Jacques Delors, Commission President, has long argued that member states
needed to compensate for the deflationary drive to convergence with EC
co-ordinated growth and greater consideration of employment. The EC's
monetary committee - comprising senior Treasury civil servants in the EC -
is now considering how to take greater account of lower-than-expected growth
in measuring convergence. Senior EC officials are admanant this does not
imply either a weakening of the Maastricht convergence criteria or a
'stretch-out' of the timetable for Emu.
Even the most hardened Emu supporters acknowledge an element of bluff. The
convergence programmes are voluntary. Convergence criteria under the treaty
allow an element of discretion. As one EC economist notes, it suits no-one
to utter these truths, because to do so would encourage backsliding among
weaker members and arouse a backlash in Germany which has insisted on strict
performance targets as the price for giving up the D-Mark.
In the end, judgment on which countries are Emu candidates will be
political. The importance of this Monday's skirmish in Brussels was that it
signalled the start of a wider battle on conditions for Emu membership.
