CENTRAL BANK governors from the European Community yesterday issued a thinly
veiled warning to Germany that it should try to contain wage inflation, for
the sake of progress towards economic and monetary union (Emu).
In their first annual report on EC monetary and financial conditions, the
central bankers' committee said their attempts to co-ordinate interest rate
policy would not be enough on their own to guarantee falling inflation and
economic convergence.
'The national authorities will not only have to rein back fiscal deficits
where they are excessive, but strong efforts should also be made to contain
wage pressures,' says the report, which the committee has to publish as part
of the Emu process.
Germany, which is currently grappling with escalating wage demands, is not
named, but the report says such respon-sibilities are particularly important
for member states 'which play a pivotal role in shaping the economic and
financial conditions in the Community'.
After yesterday's monthly meeting of central bankers, Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
head of the Bundesbank, said all his colleagues were convinced the bank was
pursuing the necessary monetary policy.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the Danish central bank and the committee
chairman, said it was clear that many countries resented having to increase
short-term interest rates in line with Bundesbank policy. But he added: 'The
policy mix in Germany is not the sole responsibility of the German monetary
authorities.'
The report refers to the difficulties of co-ordinating monetary, wage and
fiscal policy without disturbing EC exchange rates.
'If the benefits of exchange rate stability are to be preserved, a monetary
response to shocks originating in one country. . . . would be quickly
transmitted to the other Community countries,' it points out.
EC central bankers are trying to co-ordinate interest rate policy as a
prelude to stage two of Emu, which begins in 1994 with the establishment of
a European Monetary Institute (EMI) with broadly the same tasks.
The EMI will itself be replaced by a European central bank, when a date is
set for EC members move to a single currency, no later than 1999.
Mr Hoffmeyer said yesterday that the committee had not discussed the
sensitive question of the location of the EMI and central bank, which he
said was a matter for national governments.
Separately, Mr Hoffmeyer confirmed that Sweden was discussing linking the
krona more closely to the Ecu.
He warned that there could be difficulties in arranging 'associate'
membership of the EMS, because of the new obligations that would impose on
Sweden and existing members of the system. 'The question is whether you can
find a system where there is closer co-operation short of full membership,'
he said.
