acceptance of EMI as monetary force in Europe

There are growing signs that the president of the European Monetary
Institute, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, will have a struggle to get the
organisation accepted as a significant force in European monetary affairs.
The institute's council holds its inaugural meeting in Frankfurt tomorrow
with difficult questions over the pay and conditions of the staff yet to be
resolved.
There are also differences among the European central banks, who own the
institute, over how far jobs should be allocated on grounds of nationality.
More fundamentally, there are wide divergences between authorities such as
the European Commission and Belgian finance ministry, which see the EMI as
an instrument to force integration in the EU, and others, notably the Bank
of England and Bundesbank, which think its role should be mainly advisory.
Last week, the Greek government, which took over the presidency of the
European Union at the new year, cast doubt on the status of the EMI. Mr
Yannos Papantoniou, the alternate economy minister who will chair meetings
of EU economics and finance ministers until the end of June, said he doubted
whether Mr Lamfalussy would be invited to the monthly meetings of 'Ecofin'
ministers on a regular basis.
Senior European monetary officials say the Greek threat is one of Mr
Lamfalussy's lesser problems. The EMI's statutes make clear that Mr
Lamfalussy can expect to attend ministerial meetings when the functioning of
the European monetary system or broad macro-economic issues are being
discussed - which will be the case with most of them.
The officials consider the first two meetings of the EMI council will be a
significant test of Mr Lamfalussy's influence. But it will only become clear
around mid-year, when key staff have been recruited, whether the EMI will
play an important role in EU monetary policy.
Mr Lamfalussy, a Hungarian-born Belgian banker, is having to build the
institute from small beginnings. He has to recruit four or five key people
soon, including a director-general and department heads.
Meanwhile, many of the officials who served the EMI's forerunner - the
Basle-based EC central bank governors' committee - are returning to their
national central banks at the end of three-year secondments.
Officials say the EMI has 'hundreds of candidates' for senior posts, mainly
nominated by EU central banks, but they cannot be selected until the terms
and conditions of employment are fixed.
Among unresolved questions are whether non-German officials should be given
expatriate allowances as an inducement for living in Frankfurt or whether
there should be some other form of dislocation allowance for new employees
of the institute that does not discriminate against Germans. Mr Lamfalussy
will have to fight for conditions that are good enough to attract high
quality staff to the EMI.
The EU central banks believe the EMI should be kept on a tight budgetary
rein so that there is no suspicion of the extravagant behaviour that marked
the start-up of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
In the meantime, Mr Lamfalussy is unable to provide the officials to chair
the various EMI sub-committees responsible for guiding the current second
stage of European economic and monetary union. A key test of the EMI's
status will be whether his staff take over such duties when it is properly
operational later this year.
Although tough battles lie ahead, Mr Lamfalussy has one thing in his favour;
he was asked to do the job of EMI president. As long as the majority of EU
states are committed to Emu, they have a vested interest in ensuring that
the EMI plays a constructive part in the process even though the Maastricht
Treaty is vague about the institute's precise role.
