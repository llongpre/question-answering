all - Martin Wolf discusses the feasibility of stage three of the Maastricht

It has become a commonplace in the UK that economic and monetary union is so
distant a possibility as to be irrelevant. Some continental politicians,
notably in Germany, seem to agree that the Maastricht timetable is no longer
realistic. The main reason people argue that Emu is off the agenda is that
member states will not be able to meet the criteria on inflation, interest
rates, exchange rates and fiscal policy laid down in the treaty.
This judgment is likely to prove quite wrong with a profound effect on the
future of the Bank of England.
The average of the Commission's forecast 1994 inflation for the three best
performers (France, Denmark and the Netherlands) is 2 per cent. Germany, the
UK, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg all meet the criterion that their
inflation be within 1.5 per cent of this level. In early July, the average
bond yield of the three lowest inflation countries (which are not the three
countries with the lowest bond yields) was around 7.75 per cent. The
interest rate criterion - that bond rates be within 2 percentage points of
the average for the three lowest inflation countries - was met by Germany,
the UK, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg (the latter automatically, by virtue
of its monetary union with Belgium). In short, eight countries already meet
these criteria.
The requirement on exchange rates was that 'a member state has respected the
normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the two
years before the examination'. It may have been serendipity, but the wider
bands can now be used to define what is normal. Those with an excellent
chance of meeting this criterion are Germany, France, the Benelux countries,
Denmark and Ireland.
At first glance, fiscal policy is the obstacle. The treaty offers two
reference values, '3 per cent for the ratio of the planned or actual
government deficit to gross domestic product at market prices' and '60 per
cent for the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product at market
prices'.
The Commission forecasts that Luxembourg and Ireland should meet the first
criterion this year, though Germany and the Netherlands will be close (at
3.1 and 3.6 per cent, respectively). The public debt criterion should be met
this year by Germany, France, Luxembourg, the UK, though Spain (at 64.2 per
cent), Denmark (at 68.5 per cent) and Portugal (at 70.6 per cent) come
close.
If unchanged, the fiscal position would appear to preclude Emu by early
1997, when a majority of the members need to meet the criteria if there is
to be a union. Furthermore, if Emu is to start in January 1999, regardless
of the number who meet the criteria, as intended in the treaty, there might
be few participants. A monetary union between Germany and Luxembourg would
seem a definition of futility.
This analysis is misleading because the 'excessive deficit' procedure, of
which the fiscal reference values are essential components, is highly
judgmental. Furthermore, responsibility for monitoring the member states
falls on the Commission, a far from disinterested party. It will be quite
easy for the Commission to argue that without the recent recession Belgium,
France, the UK and Denmark would meet the deficit criterion. All could, in
any case, cut their deficits to meet it; most already have plans to do so.
These countries can then be added to Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands, which already either meet or almost meet the deficit criterion.
Furthermore, as recovery proceeds, deficits should shrink.
Deficits can be adjusted quite swiftly, if need be. Barring default, ratios
of public debt to GDP cannot be adjusted so swiftly. Furthermore, three
member states have ratios of above 100 per cent - Greece (110 per cent),
Italy (120 per cent) and Belgium (146 per cent). The Netherlands has a ratio
of 81 per cent and Ireland one of 88 per cent, both well above the 60 per
cent reference point.
The question is whether the debt ratio will be judged to be 'sufficiently
diminishing'. If a country has a large enough primary budget surplus - a
surplus, excluding interest payments - the ratio will at least diminish. Of
the relatively high debt countries, Ireland and Belgium both had substantial
primary budget surpluses (of close to 4 per cent of GDP) last year, the
Netherlands one of 2.3 per cent of GDP and Italy one of 2 per cent. In 1996,
the Commission is likely to argue that the eight countries that already meet
the inflation and interest rate criteria also meet the fiscal criteria.
Admittedly, the point will be stretched for Belgium. But it is already clear
that the others are likely to be cleared, since the Commission has proposed
that Ireland not be deemed to fail the fiscal tests, despite the country's
high indebtedness, because of its low fiscal deficit.
The Maastricht treaty offers two dates on the move to the third stage of
Emu. The first is not later than December 31, 1996, by when the Council,
acting by qualified majority, shall decide 'whether a majority of the member
states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single
currency'. It seems likely that seven members - Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - will be judged to meet
the criteria. The UK may fail the ERM criterion (by virtue of not being a
member), but might meet the others. Denmark and the UK also have opt-outs.
Opt-out or no opt-out, the Bank of England may be enjoying no more than an
Indian summer of semi-independence. It could well find itself locked in the
iron embrace of Emu before the end of the decade.
