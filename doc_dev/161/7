ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN in Europe has cast doubt on the ability of European
Community member states to meet the timetable for monetary union contained
in the Maastricht treaty, according to a Commons committee report published
yesterday.
The Treasury and Civil Service committee's report says it is not confident
that seven of the 12 member states, including Germany, will be able to
fulfil the convergence criteria in time for monetary union in January 1997.
It will not be achieved before 1999 if Germany does not meet the criteria
within the next four years, says the committee, but in view of Germany's
present difficulties this may not happen.
In spite of doubts about the timetable, the report points to a widespread
belief among politicians in France and Spain, and probably elsewhere in the
community, that monetary union should, and will, take place in 1997. The
view among most member states is that there should be considerable
flexibility in interpreting the convergence criteria, a view not shared by
Germany.
Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty by all member states does not mean
that prospects for monetary union would disappear, says the report.
'It is important not to underestimate the strength and depth of commitment
to monetary union amongst politicians elsewhere in the community,' it says,
adding that a number of member states would probably seek to create an
alternative institutional framework to pave the way for monetary union
should the Treaty be rejected.
The committee believes political pressure on the UK from other member
countries to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism will grow.
Non-membership following UK ratification of the Maastricht treaty would
'cause difficulties' it says.
The report says that only limited progress has been made in practical
preparations for the establishment of the European Monetary Institute and
the European Central Bank, 'a fact that may reflect the wider uncertainties
surrounding the prospects for monetary union'.
