EUROPEAN COMMUNITY finance ministers yesterday agreed to prolong member
states' economic 'convergence' programmes beyond the end of 1995, a move
which leaves open the possibility of a delay in economic and monetary union.
The European Commission portrayed the decision as a 'technical' matter which
would set a common framework for measuring EC members' performance on
inflation, budget deficits and government debt - the convergence criteria
set down as conditions for Emu in the Maastricht treaty.
But senior Commission officials were last night on the defensive after
several EC delegations suggested that the extension of convergence
programmes into 1996 could signal a delay in the Emu timetable, beyond the
earliest possible date of 1997.
Doubts about the convergence programmes have grown because of their
deflationary impact at a time of rising unemployment, and because Germany -
cornerstone of a future monetary union - does not meet the convergence
criteria for Emu because of the soaring costs of unification.
The Maastricht treaty leaves open the possibility of a delay until 1999.
But, until recently, the Commission and Emu advocates have stressed strict
convergence, with a view to early Emu - despite widespread scepticism in the
financial markets and ill-disguised reservations in Germany.
EC officials said the main reason for prolonging the convergence programmes
lay in significant differences in national programmes. There is a need for
common standards and methods for measuring readiness for Emu, they added.
Confusion about a Commission retreat on Emu began to circulate at the end of
a meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels. The confusion grew after
Italian, German and Luxembourg diplomats reported that several delegations
had voiced disquiet about rising unemployment and poor growth prospects in
the EC.
A senior EC diplomat said several member states had complained that 17m
people were out of work in Europe, driving up budget deficits through lost
tax revenues and increasing the danger of social disorder.
A senior Luxembourg diplomat suggested that the Commission had laid the
groundwork for 'stretching out' the timetable for monetary union to take
account of lower-than-expected growth. But Mr Henning Christophersen, EC
economics commissioner, categorically denied it. He stressed that
co-operation on a Community-wide growth initiative would increase the
prospects for Emu, if possible by 1997.
Mr Christophersen said that convergence programmes would continue if
necessary, 'into eternity' so that all EC members would have the chance to
meet the strict Emu criteria. 'We are not talking about a delay in the
general process. We are talking about a common time frame.'
