THE European Community sum-mit at the end of this month in Brussels is
likely to decide to place the future European central bank in Germany, Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said yesterday.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Gonzalez said the expected
decision, dashing British hopes of bringing the central bank to London,
would help rebuild political momentum towards the goal of economic and
monetary union.
The site for the European Monetary Institute, to be set up next year as the
forerunner of the planned EC central bank, would reflect Germany's prime
role in the anti-inflation 'economic philosophy' behind Emu, he said.
'I believe - and everyone else believes the same - that it (the institute)
will be in Germany.'
He admitted the EC currency crisis had placed 'a tremendous question mark'
over whether the EC would accomplish the Maastricht timetable for Emu by
1997 or, at the latest, 1999.
After the emergency move in August to wider currency fluctuation bands, he
said the EC was unlikely to decide a firm date for returning to the previous
narrow bands within the EMS. 'We don't want to be trapped by dates.'
But he refused to endorse recent claims by Mr John Major, the UK prime
minister, that the Maastricht timetable was now unrealistic. Mr Gonzalez
spoke against softening the Maastricht 'convergence' targets designed to
force EC states to curb budget deficits and government debt as conditions
for joining Emu.
Although he admitted that EC budget deficits had been swollen by recession
to well above the Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product,
he said: 'I doubt that anyone would want to give up on this convergence plan
. . . the planned convergence targets represent a good path.'
Mr Gonzalez's remarks on the EMI are the clearest prediction so far from an
EC leader that the summit on October 29 will opt for the central bank to be
established in Germany.
