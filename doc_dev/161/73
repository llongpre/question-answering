FT  10 FEB 92 / Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: Conditions for monetary
union expected to be met

THE UK fully expects to meet the economic conditions for European economic
and monetary union by the time parliament decides whether to move to a
single currency and single monetary policy, according to the Bank of
England.
In its latest quarterly bulletin to be published tomorrow the Bank says that
the government and parliament will have to decide whether to move to the
final stage of European Monetary Union (Emu) shortly before the end of 1996.
It adds: 'In the meantime, the UK authorities fully expect to meet the
convergence conditions.'
This means that by the end of 1996:
The UK will have had for one year an inflation rate that is no more than 1.5
percentage points higher - and long-term interest rates that are no more
than 2 percentage points higher - than those of the three EC member states
with the best records for price stability.
The UK's budget deficit will be either at or near 3 per cent of gross
domestic product and its ratio of debt to GDP will not exceed 60 per cent.
The UK will have participated in the narrow band of the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System for at least two years and will
not have initiated a sterling devaluation in that period.
The Bank says that other factors such as the integration of markets and unit
labour cost developments will also be considered in assessing eligibility
for Emu. While acknowledging that the criteria 'probably cannot be applied
purely mechanically', the Bank says the UK has frequently urged that
judgments on convergence must be based on economic grounds.
The UK determination to fulfil the Emu convergence criteria will mean that
whichever government is in power after this year's general election will
have to put sterling into the narrow ERM band by the end of 1994. The narrow
band limits a currency's fluctuation to 2.25 per cent either side of its
central rate.
Convergence will also impose a constraint on future government borrowing.
This has been safely within the convergence limits in recent years, but is
generally expected to rise to around 4 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 as a
result of the recession and increased public spending.
Providing parliament ratifies the Maastricht agreement, the UK will
participate fully in the transitional second stage of Emu, which is intended
to begin on January 1 1994.
The Bank notes that EC member states will have to start granting
independence to their central banks before the start of the final third
stage of Emu, although action on this in Britain's case could wait for a
commitment to move to the final stage.
The Bank suggests in another article in the bulletin that the slow growth of
credit in the US cannot be blamed entirely on financially crippled lenders
holding back funds from borrowers.
It says: 'There is little consistent evidence of creditworthy borrowers
being unable to find credit, with the exception of particular industries and
regions, notably commercial real estate development and the north-east.' A
fall in demand is also responsible for the slow credit growth.
