EC FINANCE ministers yesterday vowed to press on with the Maastricht
timetable for economic and monetary union, and called on the European
Commission to make its forthcoming White Paper on competitiveness and
employment in the Community a real instrument for job-creation.
In a televised debate on Community economic and monetary policy, ministers
easily agreed that the jobs crisis was now top of the EC agenda, but showed
little uniformity in identifying solutions.
Mr Phillipe Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium which holds the EC
presidency, underlined the general agreement that EC credibility hinged on
starting stage two of Emu on time next January, and on offering realistic
solutions to unemployment.
All participants in the lacklustre debate backed his call for tighter
macroeconomic and monetary co-ordination, and for no let-up in attempts to
control budget deficits and inflation.
As Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, put it, 'the foundations for
Emu are the same as those for growth: sound and convergent economies
operating a completed internal market.'
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economic affairs commissioner, warned that
currency instability would wreck Europe's single market and bottle up
cross-border investment. Most ministers agreed job creation would need more
flexible labour markets, a re-examination of taxes and social security
charges on employment and wage moderation. But practical interpretation of
this varied sharply.
Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, for instance, stressed the need to
shift taxes on employment on to resources, calling for the EC to press ahead
with its stalled energy tax plan.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, called for the removal of
'all unnecessary and damaging controls on business activity', in line with
the UK's submission to the White Paper debate calling for the dismantling of
much actual and planned EC social legislation, and fuller labour market
deregulation. Mr Jean Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's finance (and employment)
minister, said 'frenetic deregulation' was not the way to boost EC
credibility, and that 'we can not take on the Asian model'.
Several member states from Denmark to Portugal emphasised the need to
preserve Europe's 'model' of social provision.
UK officials nevertheless sense the debate is moving their way, and Mr
Clarke said afterwards that 'what would be a complete waste of time would be
for the Commission to emerge with something as if the member-states'
contributions (to the White Paper debate) had never been made.'
