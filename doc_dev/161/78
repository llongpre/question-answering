FT  04 JUL 94 / Brussels moves to ease debt rules for Ireland

The European Commission has proposed to exempt Ireland from the tough rules
of the Maastricht treaty on government debt, offering hope to other
debt-laden member states such as Belgium and Italy that they may receive
similar leniency.
The Commission's move, at a meeting last week of the EU's secretive monetary
committee, might turn out to be a test of Commission powers under the
Maastricht treaty. If it succeeds, the Commission might create a precedent,
making it easier for countries with bigger debt problems eventually to
become full members of Europe's planned economic and monetary union.
Commission representatives surprised senior finance ministry and central
bank officials representing EU governments by proposing to exempt Ireland
from the 'excessive deficit' rules of Maastricht even though Ireland's debt
as a percentage of gross domestic product is well above the treaty's
guidelines.
Although it is unlikely that Emu will be achieved by 1997 or 1999, the two
dates named in the treaty, member states are already preparing for the
advent of the single currency and European central bank.
As part of the preparatory second stage of Emu, which began in January, EU
countries have started working with the procedure laid down in the treaty to
control, and if possible reduce, their large fiscal deficits.
At present, only Luxembourg meets the two Maastricht treaty deficit criteria
of having an annual budget deficit of less than 3 per cent of gross domestic
product and an overall debt of less than 60 per cent of gross domestic
product.
But at a meeting of the monetary committee last Tuesday, Mr Giovanni
Ravasio, the Commission representative, said it planned not to submit a
report to the EU council of ministers naming Ireland as an excessive deficit
country.
Ireland has made strenuous efforts to bring its deficits under control,
pushing its annual budget deficits below 2.5 per cent of GDP in recent
years. But its stock of debt, at around 90 per cent of GDP, has proved less
easy to cut.
Germany and some other EU member countries fear that any softening of the
criteria for Ireland could open the door to Emu for other countries with
bigger economic problems. Belgium, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120
per cent and a forecast budget deficit of 5.4 per cent of GDP this year,
wants to be a founder member of Emu even though economists believe it has
little chance of reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio to the Maastricht level this
century.
