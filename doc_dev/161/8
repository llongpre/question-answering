BELGIUM, which takes over the EC presidency in July, will press ahead with
implementing Maastricht's goals during the second half of the year, even if
Britain fails to ratify the treaty. But Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign
minister, said last night the Danish referendum result made him confident
all 12 member states would soon be ready to move towards greater European
union.
Priorities for the six-month Belgian presidency would include preparing the
next phase of economic and monetary union, and a common foreign policy.
The second stage of Emu - including establishing a European Monetary
Institute, forerunner of the central bank - begins next January 1 and should
end with a single European currency in 1999 at the latest.
Mr Claes said last night that the demanding timetable was essential. But he
added that Maastricht's tough economic criteria for joining a monetary union
might have to be renegotiated if recession continued. Mr Philippe Maystadt,
Belgian finance minister, came out in favour of amending the criteria at the
weekend.
Earlier in the day, in a speech entitled 'Against Euro-pessimism', Mr Claes
said the original Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act, which laid the
foundation for the barrier-free internal market, were not enough to respond
to the economic and political challenges of the 1990s. 'It's time to take a
further step and the Maastricht treaty gives us the means to do so,' he
said.
Pressed on the possibility that certain member states might not ratify the
treaty, Mr Claes told an invited audience in Brussels that the Belgian
presidency would still continue the task of deepening the Community with 10
or 11 member states, 'because there is no alternative'.
He said Belgium intended to 'exploit all the new possibilities offered by
the Maastricht treaty for following a true common foreign and security
policy'. That would include preparing the administrative framework for such
a policy, and asking member states to define the areas in which common
action could be developed.
