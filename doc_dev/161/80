Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, last
night warned strongly against the setting in advance of tight exchange rate
stability criteria for countries seeking to enter European Monetary Union.
After the first council meeting of the EMI - forerunner of the planned
European central bank - at its new Frankfurt headquarters, he said it would
be 'counter-productive and very dangerous' to set explicit exchange rate
bands ahead of monetary union which he expects after 1999. The decision
should be taken at the end of the two-year period in which 'normal
fluctuation margins' have to be adhered to. 'I just don't see how we can put
any precise figure on that today.' He said the 'very hard lesson' of crises
in the European exchange rate mechanism showed that very specific currency
fluctuation margins 'give a bonus to speculative pressure'.
