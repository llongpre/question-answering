FT  01 JUN 92 / Economics Notebook: Time to have a debate on Emu and the
Bank

IN the recent House of Commons debate on the Maastricht Treaties, Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, rightly underlined that the issues of European
economic and monetary union had been more fully debated in Britain than in
any other EC member state.
But questions concerning the constitution and responsibilities of the Bank
of England as the EC moves towards EMU have so far been given no attention
at all.
This is a gap in the public debate about Britain's economic future that
deserves to be filled soon. Not only are complex issues involved, but
timetable factors are coming to the fore. In particular, the term of office
of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the present Bank governor, expires at the end
of June next year. Whoever takes over from him for what can be expected to
be a five-year term will head the Bank through what may be its biggest
changes since nationalisation in the 1940s.
The Bank's status merits discussion for two reasons. One is a global trend
towards making central banks primarily responsible for combating inflation
and giving them independence from government to achieve price stability. If
the Bank of England retains its current status, it will increasingly be an
odd man out among the world's central banks.
The other is the Maastricht Treaty itself, which alongside a single currency
envisages the creation of a European System of Central Banks made up of an
independent European central bank and the central banks of the EC member
states.
The government's position - frequently articulated by Mr Lamont - is that
responsibility for economic policy, including the setting of interest rates,
should, as now, stay unambiguously in national hands during the preparatory
second stage of Emu which begins in 1994. As long as this state exists, the
chancellor has insisted that the Bank should not be given its independence,
otherwise there would be no way of making the conduct of monetary policy
accountable to parliament.
But it is inconceivable that the Bank can stay as it is if government and
parliament eventually decide to join the third and final stage of union in
1997, when a majority of EC members will be able to decide whether to go
ahead with a single European currency and European central bank, or in 1999
when as few as two states can create the union. If Britain decides to be a
full member of Emu, the Bank of England will also have to be independent.
The timetable agreed at Maastricht means the UK government and parliament
will have to debate whether to move to the third and final stage of Emu
before the end of 1996. This is likely to be during the life of the present
parliament. Even if the decision goes against joining the third stage of
Emu, 1996 would be an occasion for a debate, or even decisions, on the
constitution and responsibilities of the Bank of England.
A number of thorny issues that cannot wait until 1997 or 1999 are already
surfacing. Some are technical, such as the role that the Bank will play in
Europe-wide systems for settling payments between banks or supervising banks
throughout the EC. Other questions are more hypothetical but fundamental,
such as the objectives, governance and accountability of the Bank of England
if it becomes part of a European economic and monetary union.
One problem with Mr Lamont's present approach towards the Bank and Emu is
that it appears to assume that the Bank could move overnight from its
present non-independent status to one of independence within Emu. The change
would in fact have far-reaching implications.
The role of the Bank would have to be clearly defined if it became
independent. Would it concentrate on securing price stability, like the
Bundesbank? Or would it retain the responsibilities for the welfare of the
City and industry or bank supervision that the Bank has today?
What should be the decision-making body if the Bank assumes responsibility
for setting interest rates, either in the context of a European central
banking system or as an independent entity?
At present, interest rate decisions are taken by the chancellor after talks
between the Bank and the Treasury. But if the Bank became responsible for
monetary policy, even as part of a European system of central banks, it
would have to restructure its decision-making organs and their
accountability.
The Bank Court, which includes industrialists, City financiers and trade
unionists as well as Bank officials, clearly could not decide on interest
rates because several of its members would be exposed to a potential
conflict of interest.
If such decisions were to be taken by a new group comprising Bank officials,
operating most likely with a one-person, one-vote system, the individuals
concerned would have greatly increased power, raising questions as to whom
they should be accountable and how.
Also, who would they represent? Britain, as a unitary state, is peculiarly
ill-placed to inject regional interests and influences into its
bureaucracies. In contrast to the Bundesbank council or the US Federal Open
Market Committee, which give the representatives of the US and German
regions a say in monetary policy making, there would be no easy way of
reflecting the preoccupations of Scotland, Wales, the west Midlands or the
north of England in the decision-making centre of the Bank of England.
These are just some of the questions that have to be answered if the UK
finally decides to join Emu. The problem is that they are so wide-ranging
that they could not be tackled at the last minute.
Indeed, it may be that Britain will not become a full member of Emu. But the
implications of Emu for the Bank of England should be considered in depth
and in advance, lest the Bank be pitchforked into a new environment
completely unprepared and with a constitution that does not do justice to
the importance of monetary policy for the UK's economic welfare.
