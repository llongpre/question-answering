EC convergence can be achieved without narrow ERM bands

The special European Council meets on Friday to mark the entry into force of
the Maastricht treaty on November 1. Some people would have us believe that
this should be more of a wake than a christening. They would argue that the
crisis in the exchange rate mechanism, resulting in August in fluctuation
bands of plus or minus 15 per cent, has set back the cause of exchange rate
co-operation and the single currency by many years, if not indefinitely.
Such a view overlooks the strong commitment most governments still have to
European monetary union. The extent of this commitment can be seen in the
absence of any moves by European governments to 'make the most' of the wider
bands by cutting interest rates and letting their exchange rates depreciate.
The temptation to do this at a time of recession is obviously considerable.
So why have they not done so? The only credible explanation is that they are
still determined to proceed to stage three of Emu and the creation of a
single currency, and that this approach is indivisibly associated in the
minds of governments with maintaining priorities as close as possible to
their old, narrow 2.25 per cent fluctuation bands.
There are, however, dangers in sticking to this policy. The longer that
monetary policies remain too tight for domestic economic recovery to take
place, the more damaging the effects on the economy. In turn, the longer
recession lasts, the greater the reduction in demand for currencies of
stagnating economies. Moreover, in most European countries, budget deficits
are high, leaving governments little room to manoeuvre their economies out
of recession by stimulating demand.
The time is therefore right for some policy rebalancing towards looser
monetary and tighter fiscal policy, with two crucial provisos. First,
monetary policy should only be loosened in those countries where it is so
tight, in relation to underlying economic circumstances, that it can be
loosened without any risk of fuelling inflation. Second, policy moves in
this direction should take place in the context of a European consensus on
the extent and manner in which it could be done. It would, of course, still
be up to each country to decide whether and how it wished to take such
action.
For governments to adopt such an approach, they will have to be persuaded
that attaining Emu does not depend on sticking as closely as possible to the
former narrow bands. They will have to be persuaded that it is possible to
have a sound monetary policy without relying exclusively on the external
anchor. It will also mean overcoming the fears in many quarters about the
dangers of excessive volatility if member states decide to use their new
freedom to permit substantial movement in exchange rates. This could damage
the single market in manufactured and agricultural goods as well as economic
co-operation between member states. This is why any greater flexibility must
be exercised within an agreed framework, which would not encourage
competitive devaluations but only permit interest rates to be lowered where
domestic monetary conditions justified it.
Friday's Council meeting provides an opportunity for such a framework to be
put in place, and for the road to Emu to be redefined in a way that takes
account of changing circumstances and that will also help a number of
economies to move out of recession.
As a minimum, the Council must agree on the site of the European Monetary
Institute, which will oversee stage two of Emu, and appoint its head. But
this is not enough: it would enable Europe to comply only with the letter of
the treaty, not with the spirit, and would not represent a move closer to a
single currency in itself. Heads of government therefore also need to
encourage the sort of changes in European economic management, which I have
outlined, to take place.
They should not just restate their commitment to Emu, but take action to
make it more likely. They should use the fact that stage two of Emu begins
in January to strengthen policy co-ordination in compensation for the wider
bands. The Maastricht treaty establishes that it is a key task of the EMI in
stage two 'to strengthen the co-ordination of the monetary policies of
member states with the aim of ensuring price stability'. It also says that
member states shall regard their economic policies as a matter of common
concern and should co-ordinate them.
The European Council should therefore commission from EC economic and
finance ministers (Ecofin), for the December summit, an outline economic
strategy for member states and the Community as a whole, which provides
enough flexibility to allow member states to rebalance their policies as
necessary, while also reinforcing their co-operative nature.
Ecofin could help this to happen by agreeing an overall target inflation
range. Member states could then express this in terms of individual money
supply growth limits which would act as an intermediate target in place of
the exchange rate. ERM participants will then find in many cases that their
present rate of monetary growth will justify much-needed interest rate cuts,
without injecting inflationary pressures into the economy.
This regime has a number of advantages, notably flexibility, since each
member state will be able to follow the monetary targets it considers most
appropriate, within the agreed overall discipline. Additional discipline
will stem from the fact that the EMI, alongside the council, could provide a
forum for discussion which would help to add further credibility to the
pre-announced targets. In many ways this sort of scrutiny would be a natural
extension of existing arrangements for submitting convergence programmes.
Nonetheless, fears about exchange rate volatility and the impact that could
have on intra-EC trade are not to be discounted. It is understandable that
member states should not want to trigger such volatility by interest rate
cuts, but it is far from clear that exchange rates will move more
erratically as a result of looser but informally co-ordinated monetary
policy. Interest rate actions would once again be taken on the basis of a
publicly announced anchor. And the maintenance of the present informal
policy of sticking close to the old narrow bands is not likely to be a
permanently viable option.
This alternative that I suggest would mean that there would probably be
changes in the current central parities within the ERM. But, quite apart
from the fact that that would help some countries to move out of recession,
it would paradoxically bring Emu nearer, rather than push it further into
the distance. In the first place this approach would promote closer monetary
and economic policy co-ordination, which is an essential prerequisite for
the move to Emu. But in addition the new parities that would emerge from
such a policy would be more firmly based on economic fundamentals than the
present ones. As such, they could be more stable and realistic.
They would also lend themselves to an earlier return to narrow bands if that
is desired, although a return to the narrow bands should no longer be seen
as a necessary precondition for the final move to a single currency.
Before the recent upheavals it seemed reasonable to regard the gradual
freezing of ERM parities as the best way of achieving Emu. But the principal
lesson to be derived from the upheavals is that we were putting greater
weight on the ERM than it was ever intended to bear or was capable of
bearing. The ERM was intended by its founders to bring about greater
stability but not to prevent realignments when changes in economic
circumstances rendered this necessary. The use of an ever more rigid ERM as
a way of forcing convergence was tempting but in retrospect doomed to
failure.
Convergence must be attained by other means. This will in time lead to more
stable exchange rates, based on economic fundamentals and, in due course,
for those countries that are ready, the move to a single currency can be
decided and implemented directly, without the artificial prop of years of a
narrow-band ERM.
