assesses EC finance ministers' steps likely to restore confidence in
currency system

TO TALK of a new realism permeating the affairs of the European Community
may be premature. But after two days of talks in a former sanitorium in
Kolding, Denmark, over the weekend, EC finance ministers took several steps
likely to rebuild confidence in the European exchange rate mechanism, while
keeping the more ambitious project of European Monetary Union in their
sights.
Mr Horst Kohler, German state secretary of finance, picked up the meeting's
central theme: the need to regain credibility. He doubted whether a majority
of EC member states would be ready for monetary union by 1997, the earliest
date set down in the Maastricht treaty, and he served notice that Germany
would not support moves to water down the targets on inflation, budget
deficits and government debt - the so-called 'convergence criteria'.
Without as much as a whimper, all present agreed. Mr Jacques Delors,
European Commission president and one of the architects of Emu, declared
that there was no need for change.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, who just a week ago
predicted that member states would have to alter the targets if the
recession continued into 1994, said he had been misunderstood.
'There is not going to be a fast-track to monetary union,' said an EC
official. 'It's going to be a long hard slog.'
Clearly a funny thing happened on the way to Kolding. There are two likely
explanations: one is that ministers are desperate to capitalise on the
Danish Yes in the (second) referendum last week on the Maastricht treaty,
and are well aware that loose talk about amending its provisions would scare
the markets.
Just as important is the influence of the two high-level official
investigations into the exchange rate crisis last autumn which led to the
forced departure of the British pound and the Italian lira from the ERM,
followed by devaluations of the peseta, the escudo and the punt.
In a commendable exercise in transparency, the Danish presidency of the EC
won agreement to make public the reports, one by the committee of central
bank governors and one by the EC's monetary committee. Both reject wholesale
reform of the ERM, emphasising instead the need to apply the rules more
rigorously.
By spreading the blame for the crisis, the committees defuse the
Anglo-German row that followed it: the Bonn government is criticised for
financing unification through borrowing, a policy mix which forced up
interest rates and deepened the recession in Europe. The UK is implicitly
rebuked for sticking to an overvalued exchange rate and for failing to raise
interest rates to deter speculators.
The reports' conclusions could have come out of the mouth of the Bundesbank:
each member state must first put its own economic house in order, and no
member state has an obligation to intervene in the markets to prop up weaker
currencies.
Ministers supported a call for an 'early warning system' whereby the
monetary committee or central bankers would use confidential economic
indicators to strengthen the case for a member state to devalue.
The call for frank, if confidential, discussions prior to devaluation may be
easier said than done, according to an EC official involved. As was evident
during the crisis last September, ministers and officials prefer to use code
rather than spell out the case for a general realignment in the ERM.
Yet Kolding's achievement was to produce a consensus on the ERM - even among
the weaker currency members such as Spain and Portugal and those outside the
system such as the UK and Italy. This consensus is an essential building
block for Emu, said one EC official.
Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer and an outspoken critic of
the Bundesbank, conceded that the German central bank had fulfilled its
obligations in support of sterling in the run-up to Black Wednesday.
