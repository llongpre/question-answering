survive the pressures imposed by the ERM debacle

In Brussels yesterday, senior European Community officials appeared in shock
as they woke up to a world of floating European exchange rates. The
explosion within the European exchange rate mechanism ends 15 years of
relative currency stability and will play havoc with farm support prices,
the Common Agricultural Policy and the EC budget.
'We have not experienced anything like this,' said Mr Henning
Christophersen, EC economics commissioner. 'We may have to adjust farm
prices every third day.'
Sir Roy Denman, former EC ambassador in Washington, was one of the few
looking beyond immediate setbacks and remaining sanguine. He argued that the
case for exchange rate stability and monetary co-operation leading to a
single currency is as strong as ever. Paraphrasing General Charles De
Gaulle's message on June 18 1940, Sir Roy said: 'Europe has lost a battle,
but it has not lost the war.'
As the dust settled, the list of political casualties grew. Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, who pleaded in vain on Sunday
night for the D-Mark to leave the ERM, looks mortally wounded. For it was Mr
Delors who seized upon the ERM as the vehicle for forcing European economies
to 'converge' in order to reach European Monetary Union (Emu) within a fixed
timetable.
Mr Delors' world of grand designs and logical structures was suited
perfectly to the expanding European economies of the 1980s, which paved the
foundation for the single European market; but the pillars of the old order
came tumbling down through the external shocks of German unification and a
deeper-than-expected recession.
Now the Community must discover whether it has the strength and political
resilience to recover its internal equilibrium, or whether more turmoil is
in the offing. As one senior EC official put it: 'The question is not
whether we can move forward, but whether we avoid going backwards.'
Commission officials are already starting to lay the groundwork for a
rearguard action. The strategy will be discussed at a meeting of the full
Commission on Friday, at which Mr Delors, still suffering from sciatica,
will be present.
The first priority will be to stress that the ERM is not dead but remains
'in suspended animation'. All the EC finance ministers, including Mr Kenneth
Clarke, UK chancellor, came down against suspending the entire ERM system
when they met in Brussels on Sunday. There was a common understanding of the
importance of trying to maintain currency stability.
Thus the old EMS structures remain intact; the same rules on intervention
apply, albeit within much wider fluctuation margins; and there is at least
the technical possibility that the one-time hard core of stronger
currencies, including the German, French and Benelux, can be put back
together again.
Meanwhile, the Commission will continue to press the case for economic
convergence according to the timetable laid down in the Maastricht treaty,
stricter budget discipline, and the preparation for the second stage of Emu,
due to begin on January 1 1994. This involves tighter EC surveillance of
European economies and the (largely symbolic) opening of the European
Monetary Institute, the forerunner of the putative European Central Bank -
assuming EC leaders can agree on a location and a president.
The second priority will be the single market. Largely ignored in recent
months because of monetary turmoil, the 1992 project to allow the freedom of
movement of goods, services, people and capital continues to gain in
credibility.
Last week the Commission unveiled plans for harmonising the protection of
design and intellectual property rights; this week, the risk is that de
facto floating exchange rates could tempt member states into competitive
devaluations which could undermine the single market.
The third priority is enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway
and Sweden. Community membership for the sceptical Nordics was always going
to be a hard sell; the dent in the EC's image means it will be even harder.
The fourth priority will be Mr Delors' own white paper on competitiveness -
the wide-ranging study on why Europe is failing to create jobs at the rate
of the US and Asia, and what it can do to restore steady economic growth.
Mr Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister, said early yesterday that the Delors
paper could serve as the basis for a much more profound reflection on the
common push for Emu. In Mr Kok's view, the crisis in the ERM had exposed
fault-lines within the Community. The deflationary pressures inherent in
Maastricht's convergence criteria had pushed up unemployment in member
states, raising threats to social stability. Some member states were clearly
unwilling to pay the price of staying the course - a blunt reference to
France.
It is now clear that it will be virtually impossible for most EC member
states to meet the convergence targets on government debt, inflation and
budget deficits by 1997, the date for monetary union. Mr Christophersen
conceded as much yesterday when he agreed that the earliest date for Emu
could only occur if a majority of currencies were in narrow ERM fluctuation
bands by the end of 1994 - a prospect that seems remote.
Some in the Commission would like to see a loosening of the convergence
criteria to make Emu more credible. But such a development looks unlikely in
the face of Germany's insistence that domestic economic interests take
precedence over European considerations, and that the price of giving up the
D-Mark for a single currency must be price stability.
These twin imperatives were displayed by the Bundesbank's token interest
rate cut on Thursday. This left the French franc at the mercy of the
financial markets. The climax came on Sunday when the Germans would not let
the French bully them into a de facto revaluation of the D-Mark or a public
commitment to reduce short-term interest rates.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, spelled out on several occasions in
his early morning press conference yesterday that the Bundesbank had gone
out of its way to support weaker member currencies. 'We have more than
fulfilled our (ERM) obligations.'
Such strong words betray a certain resentment over French tactics; but one
European monetary official countered that the French and Germans had at
least opened the crisis talks on Sunday with a joint proposal for the D-Mark
to leave the system - only to have the deal founder on the opposition of the
Dutch, followed by Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark.
Thus, Germany is ready to compromise; but continues to be the dominant force
within the Community. In the past 12 months, events such as the initial
Danish rejection of Maastricht have raised questions about whether the
treaty is the correct approach for accommodating Germany, or whether looser
arrangements are required - for example, accelerating membership of former
communist countries.
Commission officials argue that inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary, or even Slovenia, into the EC would destabilise the Community and
could wreck uncompetitive eastern economies. But some German officials and
other diplomats acknowledge that early membership could help to balance
German might while strengthening the political cohesion of the former
eastern bloc countries.
An equally profound question-mark hangs over the resilience of the EC
itself, and whether it is simply 'a fair-weather community', an institution
which can function efficiently only in good economic times but which remains
acutely vulnerable to external shocks - such as the war in former
Yugoslavia.
This is the third time, after all, that the dream of European monetary union
set out in the Werner report in 1970 has foundered. First came the 1973
oil-shock; then the second oil-shock in 1979. Now, German unification
appears to have blown the project off-course.
Mr Christophersen is optimistic. Putting on a brave face yesterday, he
rejected the UK government's assertions that there were 'fault-lines' in the
ERM. 'I don't think the system was flawed, but the system was more fragile
than we thought.' He could well have been talking about the Community.
