THE MAN who will be keeping an eye on the next phase of European economic
and monetary union yesterday got his first look at the people who will be
keeping an eye on him.
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the Belgian president-elect of the European
Monetary Institute, the forerunner of a European central bank, was quizzed
by members of the European parliament, revelling in their new powers to vet
important institutional appointments in the European Union.
But while the deputies blustered through the three-hour session, Mr
Lamfalussy remained unruffled, like a grey-suited Mahatma Gandhi, softly
preaching a policy of passive resistance to currency speculators and
imprudent finance ministers.
Mr Lamfalussy, who will launch the EMI on January 1, 1994, renounced weapons
such as capital controls and central bank intervention. 'I think the only
way to influence the market is (with) the credibility and sustainability of
policies,' he told MEPs. 'Credibility leads to (exchange rate) stability.'
Were current government economic policies credible? Mr Lamfalussy refused to
be drawn, but he said recent combinations of monetary and economic policy at
least seemed to be having some positive effect on the European recession:
'Whether government policies were deliberately wise or whether they were
just lucky I don't know, but the result isn't too bad.'
It was too soon to consider reforms to the discredited exchange rate
mechanism, following the recent series of currency crises, he said. As a
result, Mr Lamfalussy said he thought it 'improbable' that the EU would meet
the Maastricht treaty's first EMU target by 1997. Instead, a few of the
strongest EU economies would probably press on with monetary union in
'jumps', rather than pursuing an unworkable 'gradualist' approach, he said,
adding 'it isn't an easy solution, but I think it's a practical solution' -
provided all EU members accepted the discipline of stable real exchange
rates.
Mr Lamfalussy will launch the Frankfurt-based EMI in January, and he told
MEPs it would have a staff of some 200 people. They would help him act as an
impartial 'honest broker' between independent central banks, which he said
had to have a clear mandate to preserve price stability. But certain MEPs
seemed unconvinced that Mr Lamfalussy, a Belgian baron and distinguished
central banker, would have a real influence over street-fighting finance
ministers such as Mr Kenneth Clarke of the UK.
But the MEPs approved his candidacy - unanimously.
