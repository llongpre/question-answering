<F P=106> [Allan Saunderson report: "Bands Play a Different Tune for </F>
the EMS"] 
  [Text] Basel -- Europe seems to be coming round to the 
realisation that the drastic widening of the European Monetary 
System [EMS] bands last August does not necessarily have to be 
reversed for monetary union to continue. 
  The experience of history -- particularly the long years 
when 
the world's currencies were pegged to gold -- shows that EU 
[European Union] members states wanting to fix their exchange 
rates will probably have to jump into Stage Three of European 
Monetary Union [EMU] without moving back to narrow bands at all. 
  This at least was the consensus of a high-level meeting last 
week at the "central banks' central bank" -- the Bank for 
International Settlements (BIS) in Basel. It also matches the 
broadening view that the narrow 2.25 percent Exchange Rate 
Mechanism [ERM] divergence bands may in fact be 
counter-productive. 
  The Bundesbank, for instance, is once more peddling its 
aversion to narrow bands in public. But its senior officers 
make clear that the intervention obligations associated with the 
old European Monetary System (EMS) regime are no longer on the 
table for discussion until or unless governments can co-operate 
more effectively on overall economic policy. 
  France is also in no rush to return to a system which -- 
during the run on the franc in July -- cost them more than their 
entire foreign exchange reserves. 
  In Germany, responsibility for the deutschmark's external 
relationships lies constitutionally with the Bonn government, 
not the Bundesbank. But in reality the coalition government led 
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl is unlikely to try to tie the German 
central bank back into the marginal intervention obligations any 
time soon. 
  The two EMS crises of September 1992 and July 1993 forced 
the 
Bundesbank to create massive amounts of extra deutschmark 
liquidity which then flooded back into the country, endangering 
its efforts to control money supply and hence future inflation. 
  The feeling on the continent is that although the Maastricht 
Treaty specifies that EU member states wanting to relax 
currencies in Stage Three must have held them with "normal" ERM 
bands for at least the prior two years, this and other aspects 
of the EMU convergence criteria will be subject to political 
negotiations starting in the intergovernmental summit in the 
summer of 1996. 
  Therefore "normal" may not turn out to be the 2.25 percent 
that pertained for most years since the EMS's foundation in 1979 
but could easily be interpreted as the newly current "normality" 
of 15 percent. 
  The meeting at the BIS, organised by the Frankfurt-based 
European Association for Banking History, brought together 
senior central bankers such as European Monetary Institute [EMI] 
president Alexandre Lamfalussy, new BIS general manager Andrew 
Crockett and former Bundesbank director Leonhard Gleske to 
discuss what history could teach about currency union. 
  University of California expert Barry Eichengreen said that 
a 
viable international arrangement had to: provide a method of 
adjusting exchange rate relationships when a system is subject 
to an unexpected shock; possess a set of "robust" rules credible 
to financial markets; and have a means of containing market 
pressures -- such as the ability to change domestic interest 
rate levels. 
  The hope at the BIS meeting was that wider ERM bands may 
oblige governments to pursue balanced and credible economic 
policies to hold the value of their currencies rather than 
paying lip-service to artificially narrow divergence ranges that 
eventually burst. 
  Gleske commented "by maintaining larger (ERM) margins a 
number of countries would stick together and achieve better 
convergence of domestic policies. If this happened for a number 
of years then the countries in a smaller band would be able to 
move to monetary union." 
  Crockett said considerable EU consensus already existed for 
having "robust" monetary rules. 
  Most countries wanted to bring inflation down to 2 percent 
or 
below although there were differences over the technical means 
of achieving this. 
  Eichengreen said that in the days when the world's major 
currencies were still backed by gold reserves, central banks 
were able to use various technical measures which in effect 
"widened the bands" whenever capital inflows or outflows exerted 
revaluation or devaluation pressure. 
  The central banks of Europe and America also co-operated if 
a 
currency was under pressure by lending gold reserves to one 
another in a system not unlike the foreign exchange reserve swap 
arrangements now institutionalised at the European Monetary 
Institute. 
  Given that the BIS was founded in 1930 to try to facilitate 
just such international swap arrangements the venue of the 
meeting turned out to be appropriate. Though BIS efforts were 
thwarted during the 1930's by international political tensions, 
the EMI in the 1990's should historically speaking have a better 
chance of success.
