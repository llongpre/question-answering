<F P=106> ["fk"-signed report: "The European Central Bank Will Not Be </F>
Simply Modelled on the German One"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Alexandre Lamfalussy firmly 
believes that European monetary union "will come sooner rather 
than later" and that it will be a union to promote stability. 
Addressing the German banking community, the president of the 
European Monetary Institute [EMI] made it clear that the 
European Central Bank (EZB) would not be modelled solely on the 
Bundesbank. 
  An extensive shift, a kind of "cultural revolution" geared 
toward price stability has taken place in Europe, explained the 
former general director of the Basel Bank for International 
Settlements (BIZ) in Frankfurt, addressing representatives of 
the German banking industry for the first time in his capacity 
as EWI president. It is no coincidence that inflation in a 
number of European countries has stood at below 3 percent for 
years and has even exhibited a downward trend in countries that 
have seen the value of their currencies fall. 
  According to Lamfalussy, Germany and the Bundesbank have 
earned the respect of their partners for the successful pursuit 
of a monetary policy geared toward price stability over a longer 
period of time. The decision to base the EMI and the future 
European Central Bank in Frankfurt is a tribute to that success. 
"However, it should come as no surprise to you that other 
European countries also have learned something that merits 
praise. A process of learning from one another" has commenced. 
  Lamfalussy recalled that the EMI's main task is to enhance 
the coordination of member-states' monetary policies while the 
responsibility for the formulation and implementation of 
monetary policies is still firmly in the hands of national 
central banks. He cannot share the view that this amounts to 
squaring a circle, because the Maastricht Treaty expressly 
describes "ensuring price stability" as the goal of coordination 
efforts. 
  Speaking about the preparations that the EMI has to make for 
the future European Central Bank, Lamfalussy focussed on the 
monetary supply target envisaged by the Bundesbank. The central 
banks could use goals of that kind to make themselves to a 
certain extent independent of political pressure and ensure that 
there is no relaxation of policy rigors. In any case, there has 
to be a sufficiently stable relationship between the money 
supply and prices, and this is something central banks are in a 
position to influence by means of medium-term money supply 
targets. 
  Germany and several other countries believe that both 
conditions "have been satisfied, not completely, but 
adequately," explained Lamfalussy. In the case of Great 
Britain, which is the most important example in Europe, at least 
one of these conditions is no longer relevant (the same applies 
to Canada and the United States). The EMI's chief's assessment 
of the present situation is "irrespective of what we agree on 
regarding a medium-term goal, the European Central Bank will in 
any event require a clear, operational medium-term goal, such as 
the level of short-term interest rates." 
  According to Lamfalussy, monetary union can be the result of 
a peaceful and gradual convergence process (with the EMI making 
its contribution in this respect) or possibly the result of a 
crisis (which the EMI could try to prevent). In any event, he 
believes that monetary union will occur "and sooner than 
sometime next century," because economic and financial markets 
"are forcing us to do so." 
  Lamfalussy warned that without a genuine monetary union, the 
reality of the European single market will be endangered by 
pronounced negative developments with regard to real exchange 
rates. The European Monetary System is a provisional solution, 
which can be torpedoed by pressure from speculation in a 
situation in which there is free movement of capital. It is 
"self-evident," said the EMI chief, that only those countries 
that have achieved a reasonable degree of convergence will 
maintain stable nominal exchange rates within the European Union.
