ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN in Europe has cast doubt on the ability of European
Community member states to meet the timetable for monetary union contained
in the Maastricht treaty, according to a Commons committee report published
yesterday.
The Treasury and Civil Service committee's report says it is not confident
that seven of the 12 member states, including Germany, will be able to
fulfil the convergence criteria in time for monetary union in January 1997.
It will not be achieved before 1999 if Germany does not meet the criteria
within the next four years, says the committee and in view of Germany's
difficulties this may not happen.
In spite of doubts about the timetable, the report points to a widespread
belief among politicians in France and Spain, and probably elsewhere in the
community, that monetary union should, and will, take place in 1997.
Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty by all member states does not mean
that prospects for monetary union would disappear, it says.
The report says that only limited progress has been made in preparations for
the establishment of the European Monetary Institute and the European
Central Bank.
