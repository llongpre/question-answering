THE Bundesbank said yesterday European monetary union (Emu) should be
accompanied by eventual political union and warned against any compromise on
the strict conditions for entry, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
It said it was happy with the Maastricht agreement but fulfilling the entry
criteria was more important than meeting the 1999 deadline.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, dismissed reports of
serious internal disagreements over the Maastricht agreement and the fact
that moves towards political union lagged behind progress on the monetary
front.
This special statement, to be included in the central bank's monthly report,
was unanimously approved by the Bundesbank directors. Mr Schlesinger said:
'We wanted to get rid of such speculation. As is often the case with
speculation, it was wrong.'
However, the statement said the Maastricht accord did not yet show agreement
on the future structure of the political union and how it would operate in
parallel with European monetary union (Emu). 'The further development in the
area of political union will be of central importance for the lasting
success of currency union.'
Mr Schlesinger and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president, emphasised that
decisions over monetary and political union were for governments and
parliaments.
Mr Tietmeyer, responsible for international monetary affairs, said: 'In
substance, and this is the clear view of all Bundesbank council members, the
requirements and recommendations of the Bundesbank for the final phase (of
Emu) have been achieved.'
The bank said the timetable for the transitional and final phases of Emu
would put great demands on the EC. Monetary and credit policies could not
alone ensure that member countries would move towards greater price
stability.
Central banks should be independent and budget discipline had to be assured.
Regional financial aid granted by the EC must not weaken governments' own
efforts at stability.
