The European Community's monetary committee meets in Brussels tomorrow,
giving officials a first chance to pick over the remains of the European
exchange rate mechanism.
While there has been little official comment on the ERM's future since the
near collapse of the system and the adoption of 15 per cent fluctuation
bands last month, attitudes have been polarising among those concerned with
international monetary policy making.
France and Belgium still hanker after narrow fluctuation margins: an
attachment illustrated by Belgium's decision last Thursday to raise
short-term interest rates to protect the Belgian franc on the very day that
the government announced a sharp increase in unemployment to 14.1 per cent
in August from 13.5 per cent in July.
Elsewhere, however, there is a rapidly dwindling faith in narrow bands as a
way of securing price stability or providing a 'glide path' to economic and
monetary union (Emu).
Officials and economists do want some monetary discipline in Europe,
however. A free for all, with the attendant risks of competitive devaluation
and eventual inflation, could seriously disrupt the European single market
as well as damage hopes of eventually moving to Emu.
So if narrow bands are not the answer, what should be put in their place?
The debacle in the ERM and the realisation that freely flowing capital
movements could undermine any attempt to rebuild the old structure have
prompted a growing interest in those countries that manage their domestic
monetary affairs through inflation targets.
New Zealand and Canada pioneered the use of inflation targets to determine
monetary policy and have so far operated them with success. Britain followed
suit last autumn after sterling was forced to quit the ERM. Other countries
have also adopted targets: Sweden converted to the system at the beginning
of this year.
Mr Lars Svensson, professor of international economics at Stockholm
University and an adviser to the Swedish central bank, says Sweden, which
previously had linked its krona to the Ecu, realised it had overestimated
the capacity of fixed exchange rate systems as a means of promoting
stability. 'Monetary stability and credibility need to be built at home,' he
says.
But how can domestic inflation targets replace an exchange rate regime
covering a number of countries, or point the way forward to Emu?
The answer could lie in a judicious mixture of minor alterations to the
Maastricht Treaty and peer group pressure among the EC countries.
The treaty could be strengthened by adding a specific goal for member states
of price stability (usually defined as 0 to 2 per cent consumer price
inflation). The convergence criteria already define objectives for
inflation, interest rates and budget deficits, but only in relation to other
member countries and not by any absolute standard.
EC member states, setting their inflation targets with the aim of achieving
price stability, would have to accept scrutiny of their policies by other
member states.
For example, a country might decide to slash its interest rates by 3
percentage points to boost growth, producing a sharp fall in its currency.
It would have to explain to fellow EC members how this squared with its
inflation target. If it could convincingly demonstrate that the action was
justified, all would be well. If however, such a move presaged rising
inflation, the others could exert pressure on it to keep its house in better
order.
If the EC member states pursued such policies they should gradually achieve
economic convergence and be in a position some years hence to move to Emu
with its single currency and central bank. Because there would be no narrow
ERM bands, there would be no obvious target for speculative operators, such
as the New York-based hedge funds, to attack.
One problem is that the EC's experience with peer group pressure has been
mixed. Existing surveillance procedures in the monetary committee and the
economic and finance ministers' council have had only limited success in
steering EC economies towards convergence.
However, the community could strengthen peer group procedures by adapting
the planned European Monetary Institute to monitor and comment on member
states' policies. The EMI is due to take over from the EC central bank
governors' committee at the start of next year to help prepare for a single
currency and central bank by the end of the decade. As things stand, the
near collapse of the ERM threatens to leave the EMI high and dry.
A straw poll of continental economists and officials last week showed
considerable interest in such ideas. One senior Italian official said
inflation targeting was 'the logical and reasonable way forward'.
But those advocating inflation targeting and peer review by the EMI said the
EC member states' central banks should be independent, because only then
would the peer review procedures be sufficiently rigorous.
Central bank independence might pose a problem for the UK, which has so far
refused to give independence to the Bank of England.
The idea of inflation targets could also run into problems with the
Bundesbank, which argues that a central bank cannot target inflation in the
way that it can target a monetary aggregate. But the Bundesbank law sets an
objective for the bank of price stability, suggesting that the German
central bank's philosophy is not too far out of line with the aims of an
inflation target strategy.
France would be sure to have big objections. It is the most attached of all
the big economies to exchange rate stability. Its monetary authorities have
invested immense prestige in the Maastricht process and the promise that it
offers of diluting the Bundesbank's control over Europe's economic future.
But an EC-wide monetary policy based on inflation targets has a lot going
for it: how else can Europe move towards Emu without falling prey to Mr
George Soros and his ilk?
