Economic and monetary union is the central part of the project for European
unification. For a country to transfer power over its currency to an
independent European central bank represents a most far-reaching form of
European integration, not least because the central bank's decisions would
affect governmental decisions in many other fields of economic and social
policy.
The European states linked by monetary union will need to show solidarity in
many other spheres. If they were to drift apart on fundamental questions of
foreign and security policy, for example, it would jeopardise the consensus
needed in the economic field.
Once the fundamental link between monetary and political union is
recognised, three important assertions can be made. First, European Union
members that form the 'core' of monetary union will also be, for the
foreseeable future, at the core of political union.
Second, any country that opposes monetary union can also be held to oppose
political union, and vice versa. Third, any country that comes out against
either of these goals clearly has no interest in the success of the 1996
intergovernmental conference to review progress since the Maastricht treaty.
This conference will be important for trying to bring about further
improvements in plans for political union, matching the agreements on
monetary union made at Maastricht in 1991.
No one can be in any doubt that monetary union is necessary. The D-Mark
occupies what some feel to be a dominant position in Europe. As a result,
the existing European Monetary System, which is in essence a German one,
cannot be a permanent solution for Europe's monetary arrangements. In the
long run, it is unacceptable for other member states to have to acquiesce in
monetary decisions made by the Bundesbank.
A recent discussion paper from the Christian Democratic Union/Christian
Social Union parliamentary group in Bonn attracted controversy because it
postulated the likelihood of a core group emerging in the EU comprising
those member states ready for monetary union. In reality, however, this
statement contained nothing that was new.
Not all 12 members of the EU will be able to take part in European monetary
union (Emu) in 1997, or even after 1999, because they will not meet the
convergence criteria for Emu set down in the Maastricht treaty. This has
already been tacitly acknowledged in recent budgetary projections by Spain
and Portugal, at least as far as 1997 is concerned.
After the publication of the CDU/CSU paper, some observers in Britain voiced
their hope that France would not join an Emu core group that included
Germany but not other larger EU member states. Some people in Britain even
appear to think that this could cause the Emu project to fail - perhaps for
good. Such an argument flies in the face of reality, however.
Even if monetary union were limited at first to a small core, each
non-German member would be in a better position than today, since decisions
would be taken not by the Bundesbank but jointly by a European central bank.
Any country that meets the convergence criteria, therefore, has an interest
in taking part in Emu as soon as practicable.
Countries that deliberately chose not to take part in such a union would be
in a difficult position. If the D-Mark is held to be dominant today, how
much more would this apply to a future European currency in a monetary union
comprising perhaps eight or 10 present and future member states?
Countries outside Emu would have no say in the decisions of the European
central bank. This would be a serious handicap to a country such as Britain
which has Europe's largest financial market.
There are other reasons, too, why Germany is interested in monetary union.
Germany is no longer capable of, or interested in, exercising some form of
European hegemony. Its strength vis-a-vis its European partners - in
economic, political or military terms - is not comparable with that of the
US vis-a-vis its partners in the Bretton Woods system or Nato after the
second world war.
The overwhelming desire of the German political establishment is to invest
the country's strength in the construction of Europe. That fact has not been
changed by the result of the German general elections, even though
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's majority in the Bundestag has fallen.
If, however, efforts to establish monetary union were to fail, the process
of political integration would also come to a halt, at least for the time
being. This would have disastrous consequences - not simply for Germany but
also, directly or indirectly, for all other EU states.
We Germans, facing various temptations and pressures to adopt a
'go-it-alone' policy towards eastern Europe, see - due to the catastrophe of
1945 perhaps a little bit clearer than other European states - the need to
learn the lessons of history. Yet the Europe of the future cannot and must
not be built simply on the lessons of the past. The imperatives of the
present are equally compelling, and these call for common European
institutions.
The nation states of Europe must face the reality that they are no longer
capable of mastering by ourselves all their external challenges. Those who
cling to national sovereignty are seeking solace in an empty shell. In
trying to escape from Europe, they are seeking to escape reality. And this
is an endeavour which, as everyone knows, is doomed to failure.
