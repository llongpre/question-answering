YESTERDAY'S agreement by EC finance ministers to recast the exchange rate
mechanism was one of the more dramatic and desperate tactical retreats in
the community's history. In delivering such a painful blow to French
political amour propre, it may yet unleash deadly recriminations.
Certainly it would have been better if the community had faced up earlier to
the fact that an inflexible ERM was likely to shatter on the rock of the
Bundesbank's legitimate determination to preserve its reputation for
controlling inflation during the testing post-unification period. It would
have been more logical and should have been possible for the community to
agree to reorientate the ERM, rather than waiting for the markets to blow it
out of the water. Had Germany been willing to depart temporarily from the
system, its remaining members would have been free to bring down their own
interest rates in a co-ordinated fashion and the weekend's embarrassments
might have been avoided.
But the most important point about the Brussels decision to move to broader
fluctuation bands is that it is a lot better than the available
alternatives: persisting with a policy which has driven Europe into a
recession of quite unnecessary depth, or abandoning the system entirely.
Indeed, the progressive re-shaping of the ERM in the last year can be seen
alongside the grudging public support for the Maastricht treaty as
delivering an unforgettable message: that the community must not allow its
dreams to run too far ahead of economic and political realities. If it does,
then its core achievement of having constructed from the chaos of post-war
Europe an effective single market and a base for more ambitious joint
political projects will be placed in jeopardy. These are the stakes as the
community adjusts to its new realities.
The good news is that monetary conditions can now be eased in Europe, even
though it appears likely that significant interest rate cuts in Germany may
still be some months away.
Unemployment rising
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has stated his determination
to use his new freedom cautiously, but he will surely recognise the case for
using it. With unemployment at 11.6 per cent and rising, and his colleagues
on the French right positioning themselves for a presidential election race,
he should take an early opportunity to lop a couple of points off interest
rates, although he will seek to achieve this with as little damage to the
franc as possible. Given the fundamentals of the French economy, this ought
to be achievable. As rates fall across most of Europe, economic prospects
will brighten, although a full return of confidence will not be possible
without the return of fiscal discipline and economic momentum in Germany.
The more debatable question is how the EC should proceed from here. Finance
ministers have set a target of January 1994 to return to narrow bands, at
which point the Maastricht treaty says the second stage of Economic and
Monetary Union should start.
Realistic objective
It is too early to judge whether this is a realistic objective. Rather than
spending too much time considering the Maastricht timetable for Emu, member
states should set about making a bigger success of their managed system of
floating exchange rates than they have, in recent times, of running the ERM.
Prior to the formal creation in January of the European Monetary Institute,
a committee of EC central bankers, this will not be a simple task. With the
Maastricht criteria for economic convergence a less rigidly fixed lodestar
than hitherto, member states now face squarely their own responsibilities,
desirable in their own right, to pursue credible, low-inflation economic
strategies.
If this easing of European monetary policy can be accomplished without an
outbreak of ill-tempered beggar-my-neighbour devaluations, it may indeed be
possible for the community to consider an early return to narrow bands. But
whether or not this target is met, the community cannot avoid the search for
effective mechanisms for monetary co-ordination. Rather than placing all its
bets on simply being able to restore narrow bands next year, it should
consider more far-reaching ERM reforms. Those who yesterday pronounced
Maastricht and the Emu process inoperable ignore the fact that the single
market remains incomplete, and sufficiently fragile for it not to be able to
withstand sustained volatility in exchange rates between member countries.
In Britain, the weekend's events have occasioned some misplaced
schadenfreude. More appropriate would be a sense of regret that Mr John
Major is so politically damaged that he cannot even consider rejoining a
more relaxed ERM, so resuming his position at the centre of the difficult
negotiations still to come about the community's monetary arrangements.
