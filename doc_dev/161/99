THE German parliament is expected to impose conditions on the country's
eventual membership of European economic and monetary union (Emu), when it
ratifies the Maastricht treaties later this year.
Both chambers of parliament, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, plan to demand
the right to 'take stock' of Emu again in 1996, before moving to a single
currency and monetary union under phase three of the transition. Monetary
officials closely involved in the Emu negotiations say it is planned that
parliament should attach its own resolutions to ratification, to ensure that
a future German government would accept no dilution of the country's
commitment to monetary and price stability.
The parliament would demand a report from the government before the start of
phase three, in either 1997 or 1999, to ensure those resolutions had been
fulfilled.
The officials say there is no question of Germany seeking a back-door way of
opting out of economic and monetary union. The aim is rather to ensure that
the economic convergence criteria for membership, laid down at Maastricht,
are enforced equally strictly throughout the Community.
The move is seen as a way of reassuring a sceptical German public that the
move to a single currency and monetary union is not going to endanger their
national economy. At the same time it would restrict the government's room
for manoeuvre in accepting any dilution of the convergence criteria under
political pressure from other EC member states. That would be welcomed both
in the German Bundesbank and the Ministry of Finance, but not necessarily in
the Chancellor's Office and the Foreign Ministry.
The German parliamentary debate on Maastricht, due to begin about April, is
regarded with growing trepidation by high-level government officials. They
fear that the ratification process could be linked to a whole range of
EC-related grievances, as well as inner-German politics. Most of all they
fear the looming battle between the 16 federal states and the central
government for future control of the EC policy-making process.
Until now, the parliamentary criticism of Maastricht has focused on the
weakness of the treaty on political union as inadequate compensation for
German acceptance of Emu. However the public concern, reflected in opinion
polls and articulated in popular newspapers is now focused more on the loss
of the D-Mark in Emu.
The monetary officials suggest that if other EC members failed to display
sufficient determination in combatting inflation and controlling their
public spending, the German government would be able to refer to the
parliamentary resolutions to persuade them to fall into line. They could
also justify a German decision not to go ahead with the project on the
grounds that aspiring partner countries were not eligible.
