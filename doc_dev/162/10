   Experts investigating why the Sphinx
is crumbling say the culprit is sewage from a tacky tourist village
and a hotel favored by the rich and famous.
   Cries of alarm were raised in early February after a chunk of
limestone fell from the 4,500-year-old statue's right shoulder.
Suddenly, salt oozing through the limestone statue and previously
ignored cracks in its pharaoh's face and lion's body were seen as
evidence the monument was near collapse.
   A committee of specialists from Egypt, France, West Germany and
Italy probed, scraped and tested the stone for four months to see
what is happening to one of the world's best-known ancient
monuments.
   The answer is quickened decay, and the reason is sewage, said
Zahi Hawass, an Egyptologist and director general of the pyramids
area where the Sphinx has crouched since the Old Kingdom.
   Hawass blamed sewage water flowing freely from the nearby
tourist village of Nazlet al-Samman and an inadequate sewage system
at the well-known Mena House Hotel.
   Once a sleepy town at the edge of the desert, Nazlet al-Samman
has mushroomed in the last 20 years with an injection of funds
earned by locals in the Persian Gulf oil countries. The town boasts
an ever-sprouting array of tourist shops selling pharaonic
bric-a-brac, with names like Moses' Place, Pharaoh's Perfume
Factory and Cleo's Bazaar.
   Just to the northwest, the Mena House was built in 1868 to house
dignitaries assembled for the opening of the Suez Canal.
   The stately hotel's reputation grew over the decades as it
hosted Charlie Chaplin, British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery,
Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Jimmy Carter, Winston
Churchill and others. In 1974, 400 rooms were added to the original
150.
   Hawass said no sewage system was installed to meet the needs of
the bustling village, and the hotel's system was inadequate for its
expanded size. Thus, excess waste water entered the water table and
undermined the Sphinx.
   Before the recent study, Hawass said, it was assumed the statue
was deteriorating due to changes in the underground water table,
caused by the Aswan High Dam's regulation of the Nile River's flow.
   Now that the cause of the damage is determined, he said, work
will begin on repairing it.
   Egyptian experts are being joined by others from West Germany,
Britain and the University of Louisville in the United States to
formulate a long-term save-the-Sphinx plan.
   The government already has allocated $2.3 million for a new
sewage system aimed at halting the dirty-water flow beneath and
around the Sphinx, Hawass said.
   A committee set up to oversee repairs met Thursday and approved
plans to have a masonry support of limestone blocks laid just below
where the chunk of rock fell in February, then to replace the rock
on July 9.
   Hawass said restoration work in recent years, especially an
effort that began in 1982 and was stopped when the latest piece
fell, did not match ancient attempts to protect the monument. The
first on record was a patch-up campaign that began 1,000 years
after the Sphinx was created about 2,500 B.C.
   Hawass said cement used to secure loose rocks after 1982 had
turned the limestone to powder. ``The cement didn't allow the rocks
to breathe. Now we're removing all the cement and testing gypsum
mixed with rocks from Giza Plateau itself to see if the mix can't
protect sensitive areas.''
   The team of local and foreign experts also is to study the
effects on the Sphinx of Cairo's air pollution, which on most days
can be seen from Giza hovering in layers over the city of 12
million.
   Next to the Cheops Pyramid, the Sphinx is the most popular among
Egypt's thousands of monuments. But as Egyptians laugh at many of
the modern world's tribulations, they have chuckled at the Sphinx's
sewage problem through newspaper cartoons.
   In one cartoon, the Sphinx has lost his ever-present subtle
smile. He says: ``I don't care whether they call it waste water or
sewage runoff, this stuff stinks.''
   In another, pharaohs Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus, builders of
the world's three most famous pyramids on the plateau behind the
Sphinx, stand before an immigration officer, obviously ready to
leave town.
   ``We don't care what country you choose,'' one pharoah says,
``as long as it has a sewage system.''
