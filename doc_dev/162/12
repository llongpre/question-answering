   The falling of a piece of rock from
the crumbling body of the Sphinx has caused an avalanche of debate
over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and Egypt's other
ancient treasures.
   The principal casualty of the uproar has been Ahmed Kadry,
formerly chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   Kadry lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister
Farouk Hosni, of staging the falling rock incident to reflect badly
on Kadry's stewardship of the Sphinx and the other relics of
Egypt's rich past. Hosni did not reply to the accusation.
   The limestone slab fell from the Sphinx's right shoulder on Feb.
7, six days after a sandstorm buffeted Giza Plateau.
   A restoration plan is in the works. The Sphinx has been fitted
with sandbags for support and scaffolding to help in the early
stages of the effort, and a committee of experts has taken rock
samples for analysis to help decide what steps to take.
   The Sphinx, which is 66 feet high and 160 feet long, has the
head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching lion. Many
Egyptologists think the face is that of Chephren, son of Cheops and
builder of the second pyramid on Giza Plateau next to Cheops' Great
Pyramid.
   A similiar accident six years ago brought down Kadry's
predecessor, Fouad Oraby, and a Sphinx-restoration project that
Kadry began as antiquities chairman remained unfinished when the
latest rock fell.
   Zahi Hawass, general director of the pyramids area and
archaeology adviser to Hosni, will direct the latest restoraton and
conservation efforts.
   The earliest restoration of the Sphinx began 3,600 years ago.
   ``Two hundred years from now all our monuments will be
finished,'' Hawass told The Associated Press.
   ``In the past the monuments were safe from many factors that
destroy them because they were buried in the sand. The monuments
were not subjected to pollution, the environment, tourists, the
things that are ruining them now.''
   The emergency work on the Sphinx should be finished by late
March, with fallen pieces of limestone replaced and weak places
beneath the neck and shoulders treated, Hawass said. Made of weaker
limestone than other parts, the neck long has been considered a
chronic problem.
   After the emergency work, experts will draw up an overall
restoration plan, Hawass said.
   A major problem, said Omar el-Arini, Cairo representative of the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, is that previous
restorers have not learned why the Sphinx continues to decay.
   ``In a nutshell, we have been looking at symptoms of the
problems, not the problems themselves,'' he said.
   ``We have been treating it as a rock carved 4,600 years ago, but
the limestone is 40 million years old. Our approach should be to
look at an object of 40 million years.''
   One of the problems facing the team will be how to rid the
monument of salt, which is visible on many portions of the body.
   Shawky Nakhla, chief restorer for the Antiquity Organization,
said restoration efforts in the 1940s and 1950s added to the
Sphinx's salt problem.
   ``They used cement, and a lot of salt started appearing,'' he
said. ``We don't know if a high water table level below the Sphinx
is a real cause of the salt problems, or whether the salt is coming
out of the limestone itself.''
