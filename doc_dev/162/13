   Experts have started conducting tests
to determine how to repair the Sphinx, the ancient monument that
lost a chunk of stone from its right shoulder.
   The limestone slab fell from the Sphinx Feb. 7, six days after a
sandstorm buffeted Giza Plateau.
   Damage to the Sphinx caused heated political and scientific
debate over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and Egypt's
other ancient treasures.
   The main casualty of the unrest was Ahmed Kadry, until early
February chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   Kadry lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister
Farouk Hosni, of staging the rock fall to reflect badly on Kadry's
stewardship of the Sphinx and, by extension, the other relics of
Egypt's rich past.
   Restoration work began on the Sphinx on Monday.
   The monument was fitted with sandbags for support and
scaffolding to help in the early stages of the effort.
   A committee of experts took rock samples to test for salt
content and damage and to see whether the stone is strong enough to
hold iron bars that will be inserted to strengthen it.
   Tests also are being conducted to determine what kind of mortar
should be used to cement the rock in place.
   ``We're not in a hurry. We want to do things right,'' said Zahi
Hawass, general director of the pyramids area and director of the
restoration.
   The Sphinx has the head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching
lion. Many Egyptologists think the face belonged to Chephren, son
of Cheops and builder of the second pyramid on Giza Plateau next to
Cheops' Great Pyramid.
   Any damage to the pyramids or the Sphinx _ symbols of the past
with deep emotional overtones for modern Egyptians _ brings instant
outcries in Cairo's national press. The rock fall proved no
exception, to Kadry's chagrin, and charges of incompetence and
corruption flooded the newspapers.
