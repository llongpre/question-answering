   After a year of scientific debate,
archaeologists still can't figure out how to keep the Sphinx from
falling apart.
   It's been almost six months since workmen made emergency repairs
and replaced a stone that fell Feb. 7, 1988, from the crouching
lion's right shoulder.
   But the experts can't decide what to do next.
   ``Scholars from Egypt and around the world have given us good
advice, but not one has been able to come up with a sure way to save
our wonderful Sphinx,'' said Sayed Tawfik, Egypt's top
archaeological official.
   As chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, Tawfik is
caretaker of Egypt's enormous treasurehouse of the past.
   ``In all the world there's only one Sphinx like this,'' he said.
``We love him and don't want to do anything to injure him. This is
why we have an international panel studying where to go from here.''
   The Sphinx, with its wide-eyed stare and smug expression, has
undergone the jabs and probes of restorers almost since anonymous
artisans sculpted the half-man, half-beast 4,600 years ago at the
base of Giza's pyramids plateau.
   None of the intermittent remedies has been able to stop
occasional rock falls.
   Major falls touch off political uproars in Cairo.
   A tumbling rock in 1982 cost the job of the antiquities chairman
at that time.
   Last year's rockfall brought the departure of Ahmed Kadry,
pressured out of office because of a vocal and highly public row
with his boss, Farouk Hosni, the minister of culture. Tawfik was
appointed to replace him in December.
   Such sensitivity illustrates the Sphinx's monumental importance
to the Egyptians. Ancient Egypt was a cat-worshiping country, and
the Sphinx remains a very personal and popular cat.
   At times mostly buried in desert sand, at times not, the Sphinx
has survived into the late 20th century as one of world's best-known
relics, although bruised and battered.
   Nobody knows how or why or when it lost its nose and pharaoh's
beard, but they are the most obvious reminders of the unseen
stresses at work.
   Tawfik said he believes the ancient stonemasons knew the Sphinx
wouldn't survive as long as the pyramids of Giza, which form a
backdrop against the horizon.
   Some of the Sphinx's building blocks are as strong as those of
the pyramids, he said, but others, especially in the neck, shoulder
and rear haunches, are weaker.
   ``Perhaps they knew after 4,000 years or so the Sphinx couldn't
survive any longer,'' said Tawfik, an archaeology professor. ``I
think the Sphinx is a decoration of Giza Plateau, a unique one, not
a monument for eternity as were other monuments.''
   The first known effort to help the Sphinx was 3,400 years ago. As
recorded in stone, the prince who would become Pharaoh Tuthmosis IV
followed an order that came to him in a dream during a daytime nap
to remove the sand from the Sphinx. He did so and, as promised in
the dream, the Sphinx repaid him by arranging for him to usurp the
throne of Egypt.
   Fourteen centuries later, Roman technicians performed emergency
restorations at a time when the pyramids and the Sphinx already were
drawing tourists from around the Mediterranean.
   In modern times, foreign and Egyptian teams have had a go at
stopping the decay. Applying mudpacks to remove salt clusters and
injecting glue down its throat didn't work. More drastic suggestions
like reburying the monument in sand or encasing it in glass arise
from time to time.
   In the year since the stone fell, experts from Egypt, Germany,
Italy, France, the United States and other countries have given
advice on how to proceed.
   Egyptian geologists are studying rock samples. Specialists are
monitoring desert winds that blast the Sphinx. Pollution experts are
studying the effects of dirty air. Water and soil technicians are
testing the water table level on and near Giza Plateau, checking
whether subterranean water is causing salt to weaken the limestone.
   Even so, the Giza Plateau's antiquities director, Zahi Hawass,
remains optimistic.
   ``I believe for the first time in its history we are able to save
the Sphinx,'' Hawass said, explaining that advanced scientific
findings in many fields are being applied to archaeological work.
   But for the Sphinx, he said, time is passing fast.
   ``He's like a suffering old man who needs an operation. But what
kind? When the rock fell (last year), it was kind of a red flag,''
Hawass said. ``At that time the government appointed a committee to
decide what to do. We're still meeting.''
   And it will continue to meet, he said, until it comes up with a
plan that won't repeat the earlier restoration efforts that harmed
the Sphinx more than they helped.
