   An ancient mummy of an aristocratic
young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in a plaster death mask, has
been unearthed in a shallow pit at the foot of the Great Pyramid of
Cheops.
   ``She's really lovely,'' said Aly Hassan, director of pharaonic
monuments for the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. Hassan dated
the mummy as 4,400 years old, one of the earliest ever found in
Egypt.
   Egyptologists expressed surprise at Thursday's discovery, noting
the Giza pyramids area has been looted repeatedly since antiquity
and excavated by some of the greatest archaeologists of the last two
centuries.
   Hassan said the seals of the grave were intact when an
antiquities inspector accidentally found the burial shaft.
   Officials who entered the grave found the mummy. She wore a
bronze crown covered with gold leaf on her head and jewelry around
her neck.
   Jewelry, pottery, wooden items, a piece of glass, flint,
obsidian, a clove of garlic and more than a dozen teeth lay nearby.
The wood and garlic may have been placed in the grave to keep
insects away.
   The mummy was not identified, but Hassan said the woman's
nobility was established both by the finery buried with her and the
site of her burial, a cemetery reserved for officials of the ruling
court.
   She was about 22 years old when she died and stood five feet
tall, Hassan said. He said the body dates from the Fifth Dynasty,
which lasted from 2465 B.C. to 2323 B.C. He said he dated her body
from that dynasty because other bodies in the cemetery were from
that period.
   Her body is so dried out that it has been wrapped in foam for
protection and bound beneath the head.
   Zahi Hawass, director general of the Giza area, said the new
mummy might have been an important person reburied for safekeeping
in the shaft where she was found.
   Two vast cemeteries lie under Giza Plateau, one with royal tombs
to the east of the Cheops pyramid. To the west lies the one with the
new mummy, put into use five years into the reign of Cheops 4,600
years ago.
   Inspectors have identified the owner of the complex in which the
shaft was found as S-ankh Ptah, but his position under the pharaohs
and his relation with the mummy remain mysteries.
   Egyptologists hope the mummy can provide clues into early
mummification, an art of preservation that spanned more than 3,000
years of Egyptian history into Christian times.
   ``Any find in the Giza area in such a condition is a great
addition to archaeology,'' said Hassan. ``This mummy changes our
concept of preservation and mummification and provides a new date
for (it).''
   The earliest true mummy is that of Waty, found in the tomb of a
court singer called Nefer at Sakkara. Waty's mummy dates from the
late Fifth Dynasty and was preserved so well by resin-soaked
bandages that even a callus on the sole of a foot is visible.
   Egyptians mummified their dead for thousands of years and was
refined over the ages using a solution of naturally occurring
preservative compounds.
   An obstacle to unraveling mysteries that still surround the
mummification process is that the ancients left incomplete pictorial
records of the embalming ritual.
   Some say the art of mummification was too sacred to be revealed.
