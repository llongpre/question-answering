   More than 4,200 years ago, Pharaoh
Pepy I heard one of his queens was plotting against him. He sent
Weni the Scribe to find out.
   Weni did. History didn't.
   Guilty or innocent? Cunning or faithful?
   Pepy's hapless queens have been suspects ever since.
   Now a French-Egyptian archaeological team, digging and recording
a queenly pyramid field 20 miles south of Cairo, is on its way to
unraveling one of ancient Egypt's most tantalizing intrigues.
   ``We have mention of three Pepy queens'' in ancient texts, ``and
now we have three burials,'' said Vassil Dobrev, a Bulgarian-born
Egyptologist on the team led by French historian Jean Leclant. ``As
we search on, we'll find the answers.''
   Which was the queen in question, and did she do it?
   Weni went to his grave with the secret, leaving a record of his
investigation that ended: ``I know the truth.''
   The scribe's silence did not enhance the pharaoh's reputation.
Pepy I, who died in 2255 B.C. after a 34-year reign, is remembered
for two things: an ability to keep Egypt's far-flung, troublesome
colonies in line and an inability to do the same with his queens.
   Early grave robbers, peasants revolting against the pharaohs and
generations of stone thieves left few clues to the alleged
conspiracy intact. The pyramids of Pepy's queens were so completely
ransacked that restorers work alongside archaeologists to minimize
the danger of falling walls.
   Generations of sycophantic tomb artists depicted ancient
Egyptian queens as perfect mates: beautiful, submissive, adoring.
   Egyptologist Zahi Hawass said the story of Pepy and his queen
shows that some ancient royal marriages were less than ideal,
especially since pharaohs had to deal with multiple wives and had
both major and minor queens.
   A pharaoh's chief queen, as consort of a god, received special
privileges, including the title ``great royal wife.'' Because of
the numerous other royal offspring, a young pharaoh-to-be often
married his sister to enhance his right to the throne.
   A few queens even managed to rule Egypt.
   ``We can understand the queens' importance by their tombs,''
said Hawass, who directs the pharaonic cemeteries of Giza and
Sakkara to the south. ``The largest was the pharaoh's tomb. After
all, he ruled Egypt. His tomb had to show that power.
   ``But directly after his tomb in size came the queens', then the
princes', then the nobles' and officials'; a cemetery easily shows
their ranks in life.''
   Allegations of a palace plot by a main queen was taken so
seriously that Weni was allowed inside the forbidden harem to
investigate the rumors. Hawass said Weni left no record of the
queen's name, referring to her only as a ``main consort'' of the
pharaoh.
   Until this dig, the only Pepy wives whose names were known were
Ankh-nes-meryre I and Ankn-nes-meryre II. Both were recorded by an
official named Khui, who said the king married two of his family
members. It is unlikely either sister would have been the main
queen because their blood wasn't royal enough.
   So who was the alleged plotter? Dobrev and his colleagues, who
are at the end of the dig for the season, hope the answer lies in
the third pyramid.
   The French-Egyptian expedition first came to South Sakkara, site
of the pyramids of Pepy I and his pharaoh sons Merenre and Pepy II,
in 1965.
   Its task was to record the last of the Old Kingdom's great
pyramid complexes on the edge of a 3-square-mile stretch of desert
graves spanning 3,000 years.
   Pepy I's pyramid proved particularly important because of
intricately carved texts of spells, rituals and myths designed to
help propel the soul of the dead pharaoh into the afterlife.
   For two decades, archaeologists were too busy to look for his
queens, but by 1988 high technology was available to help. Experts
combed 50 acres of rubble-strewn dunes adjacent to Pepy's pyramid
with ultrasound equipment developed in France.
   Soundings monitored by French technicians pinpointed two good
possibilities. The team started digging, and found two queens'
pyramids.
   A portion of a third pyramid was discovered last year, wedged
between the first two and roughly the same size, about 66 feet tall.
   Three pyramids. Three queens.
   Diggers began excavating the new pyramid early this year,
uncovering pottery shards, a chapel, a passageway and a burial
chamber.
   By the time digging ended March 28, there were two important
clues that could help solve the mystery of the accused queen.
   One was the name Nub-Unet on wall reliefs. The queen was unknown
to Egyptologists and may have been the royal wife Weni described.
She was buried in the eastern pyramid.
   The second clue was an empty basalt sarcophagus, its lid buried
beneath two massive boulders that once closed the burial chamber of
the middle pyramid.
   Dobrev hopes the lid, when uncovered, will bear the name of the
queen and something about her, but that is next season's work.
   Hawass thinks he knows what Weni the Scribe left unsaid about
Pepy's queen.
   ``Weni bragged that he alone investigated and he alone knew the
truth,'' the cemetery director said. ``He had solved the problem.
That's where the tale ends.
   ``I think Weni told Pepy his queen was not guilty, because Pepy
would never have allowed her to be buried next to him if she had
done something so evil.''
