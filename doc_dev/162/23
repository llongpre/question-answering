   Chunks of stone that fell from the
4,500-year-old Sphinx have been returned to their place, and the
statue will undergo emergency restoration at five other weak
points, an official said Wednesday.
   Besides weathering the ravages of desert sands and winds over
the centuries that caused the pieces to fall from the right
shoulder of the half-man, half-lion, the statue also has been
victim of a ``bad restoration project,'' which had further worsened
its condition, said Zahi Hawass, director general of the Pyramids
area.
   ``The Sphinx is like a suffering old man who needs an
operation,'' Hawass said of the world-reknowned statue, which lies
near the three famed Giza pyramids on Cairo's western outskirts.
   ``There are five weak points where stones can fall off any
minute,'' Hawass said. The worst problems, he added, stem from a
rising water table and a restoration project that ended just last
year.
   Hawass, who was appointed to his post in 1987, estimated the
repair cost at $10 million.
   Since the Sphinx was built of limestone around a large rock
about 2,500 B.C., it has alternated between being buried under the
sand or subjected to restoration projects that were begun by
ancient Egyptian pharoahs.
   About 3,000 years ago, Tuthmosis IV saw in a dream a suffering
Sphinx buried under the sand, which promised him rule of Egypt if
he cleaned up the area. Tuthmosis had the sand covering the statue
removed and soon afterward he became pharoah.
   Restoration work on the statue also was done during the
Greco-Roman era 16 centuries ago, and by enthusiastic foreign
Egyptologists in the early 20th century. Officials of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization pitched in between 1982 and 1987.
   Close-up, the proud-looking statue is a patchwork of the results
of the various restoration operations. The Greco-Roman and early
20th century attempts involved giving the vulnerable parts of the
statue a second protective skin of limestone.
   The restoration that ended last year included giving the Sphinx
a 10-inch thick coat of limestones, using cement and gypsum to
stick them together.
   It is this last operation that Hawass and other Egyptologists
have attacked, saying the cement and gypsum did not allow the
limestone to breath. Another problem, they said, was a rising water
table that caused salts to weaken the limestone structure.
   ``It was a very bad restoration project,'' said Hawass. ``We
have to remove this layer, but when we tried that, we found that it
will hurt the original body of the Sphinx. So now we do not know
what to do.''
   He said that Egyptologists and scientists were trying to develop
a chemical mixture to serve as mortar to hold the stones together
while allowing them to breathe.
   Hawass stressed that no damaging cement or gypsum were used in
Tuesday's restoration. The stones will be held in place with a wall
of dovetailed pieces of limestone.
