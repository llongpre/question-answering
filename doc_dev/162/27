   Finding a new home isn't easy if you're
30 feet tall and weigh 50 tons. But if your name is Ramses the
Great, welcome mats come out all over.
   The question for Egyptian antiquities officials was which mat to
choose and they now have decided the proper thing would be to bring
Ramses back home from Cairo to this quiet village on the edge of the
desert, known in Ramses' time as Memphis.
   The rose granite colossus of the warrior Pharaoh Ramses II, who
reigned in 1292-1225 B.C., was taken from Mit Rahina in 1954 to a
platform in front of Cairo's bustling central railway depot on
orders of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had taken power in a coup two
years before.
   That decision proved a headache for the officials, however. They
worried that exhaust fumes from heavy motor vehicle traffic would
cause the statue to crumble and that the vibration from railroad and
subway trains beneath it would cause it to crack.
   In the late 1980s talk turned to saving it. One suggestion was to
move Ramses to the Giza Pyramids and another was to put him on an
artificial island in the Nile.
   In early June, however, a different course was decided.
   ``We decided to take him home, back where we got him,'' said
Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   When Ramses left Mit Rahina for the square renamed for him, Cairo
was a city of tree-lined boulevards. Today it's a megacity of 12
million people and growing.
   ``Poor Ramses,'' Egyptologist Gamal Mokhtar, a former chairman of
the antiquities organization, said in Cairo.
   ``He was brought here at the request of ... President Nasser, who
had overthrown the monarchy and wanted a symbol of ancient Egyptian
power. Nobody questioned it. You didn't at that time. Nobody thought
whether being in the city center was good for the statue. It isn't.''
   Nasser died in 1970.
   The statue has to be moved not only for its safety but also the
Pharaoh's dignity, Mokhtar said.
   ``Such statues never belonged in a public square,'' he said.
``They belonged in temples, facing the people, as a warning and
reminder of the Pharaoh's might.
   ``When you come into Cairo from the north, you see Ramses'
backside. That was never meant to be on public view. For one of
Egypt's greatest Pharaohs, this isn't proper.''
   Mit Rahina is a fitting place for Ramses. It is rimmed with date
palms and swaying halfa grass, which, when it was called Memphis,
brought fear and dread to adversaries throughout the ancient world.
Memphis was Egypt's first true capital and later its military
headquarters.
   Ramses II brought great power and wealth to Egypt. He built more
buildings and more colossal statues than any other Pharaoh.
   He had other capitals, but Ramses had special affection for
Memphis, 17 miles south of Cairo. Memphis is thought to have begun
life as no more than a tiny fortress beside the Nile, protected by a
white wall. In its heyday it stretched for miles and incorporated
military barracks, temples, palaces, shipyards, weapons factories
and craftshops.
   Its cemeteries extended for 50 miles and included the Giza
Plateau, home of the pyramids. Historians record that its Temple of
Ptah, the creator god and Memphis' patron, was a third of a mile
long and a quarter-mile wide and fronted by monumental statues of
Ramses.
   How many colossi of Ramses graced Memphis is not known, but
records say at least 15 were at the Ptah temple alone. A fallen
statue that would have stood about 45 feet, with fingernails the
size of hands, lies toppled on its back.
   A third colossus is the centerpiece of the Ramses exhibit now in
Dallas, Texas, at the end of a tour of the United States.
   Pieces of other statues lie among ancient Memphis' ruins, red
granite torsos and heads mingled haphazardly with weeds. Some are
covered with dirt for protection from village children, who use the
ruins for playgrounds.
   For part of the year the sacred texts, column bases and statues
are trapped in marshes, salty water rising as high as 6{ feet,
soaking and decaying all in its path.
   Tawfik said he believes the return of Ramses will mark a new
beginning for the ancient city.
   ``When visitors come to Mit Rahina, they stay only 30 minutes or
so, just enough to see the fallen Ramses and the monuments on
display,'' he said. ``We want to provide enough to keep them here
all day.''
   He said Memphis suffered because it was too important for too
long. Lived in for 1,700 years by Ramses' time, the city was built
largely of perishable mud-brick. Generations built on the fallen
mud-brick houses of their forbears so that ``what we have now are
ruins, not a complete city,'' Tawfik said.
   Except for the remnants of the once-magnificent temples, little
of old Memphis remains in Mit Rahina.
   ``The ancient Egyptian ... was mainly interested in the
netherworld, the afterlife. This is where he put his major
efforts,'' Tawfik said. ``This is why we have left so many examples
of monuments for eternity but not so many for life.''
