   After years of controversy and public debate, a
renovated and sparkling Louvre museum opened today, crowned by a
tall glass pyramid at its new entrance.
   After President Francois Mitterrand cut the ribbon at the
inauguration ceremony and toured the collection, hundreds of people
crowded in for a look.
   ``It's light, it's beautiful, it's superb,'' said Martine
Bieri-Duminy, who lives nearby and watched the pyramid, designed by
American architect I.M. Pei, being built.
   ``In the beginning, people in the neighborhood were against it.
They thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture,'' she said.
   The dark, dingy Louvre most tourists remember is now a thing of
the past. In its place is what is called the ``Grand Louvre,'' a
splendid ultramodern and high-tech facility.
   The six-year, $850 million overhaul is the first part of a vast
project to turn the Louvre, once a medieval fortress and then a
royal palace, into the world's largest museum _ a distinction now
held by the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
   The Louvre project will be completed when the museum's northern
wings, occupied by the Finance Ministry for the past 100 years,
open to the public in 1993.
   The Grand Louvre is a unique blend of grandeur, history and
convenience.
   Visitors who once wandered looking for the museum's entrance
can't miss the new one _ a 70-foot, transparent pyramid soaring out
between the Louvre's main wings and flanked by three small pyramids
and fountains.
   At the ground-level entrance are escalators and a graceful
spiral staircase leading down to a vast, light-drenched lobby
featuring ticket windows, the museum bookstore, boutiques,
restaurants and a 400-seat auditorium.
   The lobby itself can handle 6,000 people time without crowding.
Escalators leading to other parts of the museum branch out from the
lobby, like spokes in a wheel, and shorten the routes to works like
the Mona Lisa and Winged Victory.
   The baroque architecture of the Louvre built under Napoleon III
looms large against the ever-changing Paris skyscape.
   ``I used to pray for sun,'' Pei said in an interview.
``Afterward, I realized that the pyramid is even more transparent
on a gray day when it takes on the moodiness of the Paris sky.''
   A visit to the Louvre is a trip back in time. Visitors now have
direct access to the vestiges of the medieval castle built by King
Louis Philippe in 1200 to protect Paris from invaders from England.
   Also on show is a history of the Louvre documented by thousands
of artifacts dug up in the Napoleon courtyard. They bring to life
the daily routines of Parisians from the 15th to the 19th centuries.
   With about 650,000 square feet of additional floor space,
hundreds of paintings will have been dusted off and displayed for
the first time.
   On view for the first time since 1963 are four mammoth murals by
Charles Le Brun (1619-1690) titled ``L'Histoire d'Alexandre.''
   When the Grand Louvre is completed in 1993, it will house about
4,000 items, nearly double what it displays today.
   Pei's pyramid, in specially manufactured slightly tinted glass,
was the most controversial aspect of the renovation.
   ``Five years ago, I had my doubts,'' Pei said. ``Not many people
would have bet on this project.''
   Backed strongly by Mitterrand, who initiated the project, Pei
perservered. The public was won over when a full-size model was
erected on the spot.
   ``All through the centuries, the Louvre has undergone violent
changes,'' Pei said. ``The time had to be right. I was confident
because this is the right time.''
