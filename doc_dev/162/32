   Workmen cleaning a heavily traveled tourist
area of a fabled temple stumbled across an ancient hoard of statues
of pharaohs and gods, a discovery that researchers called a
potential gold mine of historical data.
   Officials said five statutes so far have been dug up inside the
famous Luxor Temple in Luxor, a Nile River city about 450 miles
south of Cairo.
   ``There are other statues still buried, and only small parts of
them are showing,'' Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization. ``We will know more when we dig them up.''
   He said he expects the statues to represent leaders and deities
from a 750-year period that ended about 500 B.C., shortly before the
Persians conquered Egypt.
   Displaying the find to President Hosni Mubarak on Friday,
Egyptologist Aly Hassan described it as ``the most important of the
end of the 20th century.''
   Notable from the first half of the century are the discovery of
the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun across the Nile River from Luxor in
1922; a fabulous golden trove found in the Nile Delta at Tanis in
1939; and a dismantled full-size boat found beside the
4,600-year-old pyriamid of Pharaoh Cheops in 1954.
   Hassan said the Luxor Temple discovery turned up by chance on
Jan. 22 during routine cleaning of an area at the western end of the
temple's Amenhophis III courtyard, rimmed by towering and majestic
columns.
   Three of the five statues found so far have been identified, he
said.
   One is an 8-foot quartzite statue of Pharaoh Amenhophis III, who
ruled Egypt in 1391-1353 B.C. and founded the existing Luxor Temple.
The others are life-sized or larger.
   Another statue, 5{-feet long and made of black diorite, depicts
the cow-headed goddess Hathor, guardian of women, beauty and love.
The third identified statue, made of granite, is of General
Haremhab, a soldier who usurped the Egyptian throne at the end of
the 18th dynasty after Tutankhamun and his caretaker Aya died.
   He said the Amenhophis III statue became visible as workers were
cleaning.
   ``Nobody expected such a find because the area is visited by so
many tourists each day,'' Hassan said.
   Until Friday, the cache remained covered and under guard.
Antiquities officials debated whether excavating the relics would
damage the fragile temple and jeopardize the stability of columns.
   Luxor Temple, an island of stone beauty beside the Nile, is
considered the most endangered monument in the Luxor area,
undermined by a rising water table and a river of sewage water
flowing beneath it.
   During its construction, the temple underwent continual changes
and additions, including changes ordered by Tutankhamun, Ramses II
and Alexander the Great.
   After the reign of Amenhophis III, ancient Egypt's religion
underwent major upheaval when his son and successor Akhenaten
ordered that a new god, Aten, be given precedence over the existing
array of deities. His agents hacked the name of Amun, the
long-favored god of Thebes, from monuments throughout Egypt.
   The new discoveries give evidence of the turbulence, as the name
Amun was chiseled from Amenhophis's statue. Egyptian officials said
the cache surely will yield historical data from the period of
religious frenzy and violence.
   Antiquities officials said the statues probably were hidden by
temple priests.
   ``We can expect to find such caches from time to time,'' said
Zahi Hawass, archaeological adviser to the culture minister and
director of Giza Plateau. ``We think these objects were buried by
priests trying to hide them during periods when strife was occurring
throughout the country.''
