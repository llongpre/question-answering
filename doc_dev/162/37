   After years of bitter debate, President Francois
Mitterrand on Wednesday reopened the Louvre as a gleaming,
high-tech museum capped by a controversial glass pyramid at the
main entrance to the medieval palace.
   Visitors poured in for their first look at the six-year, $850
million overhaul designed by American architect I.M. Pei and still
in progress. When renovations are finished in 1993, the
centuries-old building will be the world's largest museum.
   ``The interior of the pyramid is even more extraordinary than
the exterior. I think the modernism goes very well with the
classical style,'' said Franck Domingue, a Parisian who fought his
way inside the museum that is now known as the ``Grand Louvre.''
   ``It's light, it's beautiful, it's superb,'' said Martine
Bieri-Duminy, who lives nearby and watched the pyramid go up.
   ``In the beginning, people in the neighborhood were against it.
They thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture,'' she said.
But now that it is completed, ``it's good for the Louvre, it's good
for Paris, it's good for France,'' she said.
   Visitors who once lost their way in dark, dusty painting
galleries on their way to the ``Mona Lisa'' or ``Winged Victory''
are sure to appreciate the spacious and air-conditioned interiors
illuminated by skylights.
   The days of searching for the Louvre's entrance also are over.
It's hard to miss the 70-foot transparent pyramid rising gracefully
between the museum's two main wings in the center of the Napoleon
courtyard.
   Flanked by three smaller glass pyramids and night-lighted
fountains, the pyramid crowns a vast, underground lobby featuring
ticket windows, boutiques, an expanded bookstore and a 400-seat
auditorium with top-quality acoustics.
   From there, escalators branch out like the spokes of a wheel,
connecting the pyramid to other portions of the museum and reducing
the distance visitors once had to trek from one end of the U-shaped
Louvre to the other.
   ``The sense of orientation is the primary concern when
redesigning an encyclopedic museum,'' Pei said in an interview.
``The pyramid is the center of gravity, and one radiates from there
to the Italian, French and antiquities collections very easily.''
   The view from below is breathtaking. The baroque achitecture
added to the Louvre in the 19th century looms against the
ever-changing Paris skyscape.
   ``I used to pray for sun,'' Pei said. ``Afterward I realized
that the pyramid is even more transparent on a gray day when it
takes on the moodiness of the Paris sky.''
   The pyramid links visitors to the underground vestiges of the
first Louvre castle built by King Philippe Auguste in 1200 as a
military stronghold to protect Paris from English invaders.
   From specially built wooden walkways, visitors can stroll among
the restored ruins, including the base of the castle keep and
rounded turrets of the thick stone wall that once surrounded it.
   Remodeled as its royal habitants demanded more comfort and
luxury, these vestiges were unearthed during recent excavations
under the Cour Carre and are displayed under soft, yellow lighting.
   Also on display is a history of the Louvre itself, documented by
thousands of artifacts dug up in the Napoleon courtyard. They bring
to life the daily routines of Parisians over the centuries.
   Lovers of 15th century and 17th century French art will enjoy
airy high-ceilinged galleries on the third floor overlooking the
Cour Carre and the pyramid. The paintings have been cleaned,
reframed and hung at eye-level against gray walls illuminated by
skylights.
   ``This is a gigantic transformation,'' said Pierre Rosenberg,
the Louvre's head curator of paintings. ``The real issue is
creating rooms where one can both learn and enjoy.''
   One hundred paintings have been taken out of storage. On view
for the first time since 1963 are four mammoth murals by Charles Le
Brun titled ``L'Histoire d'Alexandre.''
   When the Grand Louvre is completed in 1993, it will house 4,000
items, nearly double what it displays today. With 650,000 square
feet of additional floor space, hundreds of paintings will have
been taken out of storage and shown publicly for the first time.
   Pei's pyramid _ in specially manufactured, slightly tinted glass
to be cleaned twice a month by Alpine climbers _ was the most
controversial aspect of the renovation project initiated by
Mitterrand.
   ``Five years ago, I had my doubts,'' Pei said. ``Not many people
would have bet on this project.''
   But Pei and Mitterrand held firm, and the tide turned in their
favor when a full-size cable model was erected on the spot.
   ``All through the centuries, the Louvre has undergone violent
changes,'' Pei said. ``The time had to be right. I was confident
because this is the right time.''
