   Earthquakes in the past disfigured one of
Ramses II's colossal faces at Abu Simbel in southern Egypt, toppled
Alexandria's Pharos Lighthouse and destroyed some of Cairo's most
beautiful mosques.
   But they've failed to faze the oldest of the great monuments,
the Giza pyramids or, so far, the newest, Gamal Abdul Nasser's
Aswan High Dam, which began operating in 1971.
   In October, when the killer earthquake struck northern
California, followed by another closer to home in Algeria,
Egyptians began to worry about the High Dam's safety.
   Seventeen times the size of Cheops' Great Pyramid, the
Soviet-built Aswan is the world's largest rock-filled dam and it
holds back the world's second largest man-made lake, 310-mile-long
Lake Nasser.
   A serious breach of the dam would send a huge wall of water _ an
estimated 110 billion gallons _ roaring through the Nile River
valley, where almost all Egypt's 55 million people live.
   Rushing toward the Mediterranean Sea, it would sweep away much
of ancient and modern Egypt and reach Cairo in three days.
   ``When I'm asked if the Aswan High Dam is safe from earthquakes,
I can say it is, up to magnitude 7 on the Richter scale, because
we've made a mock-up of the dam and tested it,'' said geophysicist
R.M. Kebeasy, Egypt's leading dam expert.
   ``Even if an earthquake were to occur beneath the dam itself, it
would withstand it to this level. Still, we're taking no chances.
We monitor seismic activity 24 hours a day.''
   On Nov. 14, 1981, a 5.6 quake centered 40 miles to the south of
the dam and a series of aftershocks startled Aswan's residents.
   It was the strongest in living memory at Aswan, and all of Egypt
shared Aswan's concern.
   ``Even though this earthquake was not a major concern for us, we
took earthquakes seriously from that time,'' Kebeasy said. Within
months Egypt had its first seismic station at Aswan, equipped with
U.S.-supplied equipment and advisers.
   Pressure on the dam and the surrounding geology is daunting.
   Every year for eons, an estimated 134 million tons of sediment
made its way down the Nile to the sea. Now it is captured behind
the dam, adding that much more weight to the lakebed.
   Water levels and pressure shift constantly, accommodating
differences in wind direction, flow northward from Sudan,
temperature and other factors.
   Kebeasy said geologists weren't at all surprised when
earthquakes started occurring as the lake began to fill.
   ``We thought the largest ones would appear when water is
highest,'' he said. ``They don't. The strongest ones coincide with
drought.''
   He predicts that earthquake activity will diminish as the dam
area conditions itself to its new geological feature: a huge lake.
   But other experts, such as Boston University's Egyptian-born
Farouk el-Baz, advise caution.
   ``You have an immense weight of water, and you have water
seeping through faults acting as a lubricant,'' he said. ``People
should neither sit around worrying about it nor forget it. You have
to be on the alert.''
   An early critic of the dam was geologist Farkhonda Hassan, a
former member of parliament, now a professor at American University
in Cairo.
   She and others still question whether the Aswan earthquakes are
caused by the weight of the lake or, more dangerously, by faults
like the San Andreas that caused the California quake that measured
7.1.
   The dam was built, she noted, in Nasser's time.
   ``You couldn't criticize. If you did you were branded a bad
Egyptian,'' she added.
   ``There were scientists in Egypt willing and able to do in-depth
geological surveys of the area, but we weren't included.
   ``I believe the dam would have been built anyway, but I would
like to have seen it built with more science.''
