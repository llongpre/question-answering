"For most foreigners, Egypt's culture is in the past. For us, Egypt is not of 
the past, it is the future," said Farouk Hosni, Egypt's minister of culture, in 
an interview over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's past is unrivaled and unparalleled. In the present it has many rivals 
and many cultures surpass it, but Egypt also aspires to have a strong presence 
in the contemporary world." 
</P>
<P>
People who don't know Egypt well are surprised to learn about the vitality of 
its contemporary arts, he said. "We are trying to find the means to express 
this richness." Following in the footsteps of writer Andre Malraux in France 
and actress Melina Mercouri in Greece, Hosni, a painter, is among the rare 
breed of artists who serve their countries as high-level administrators. On his 
first visit to the United States -- a 12-day jaunt that includes Dallas, New 
York and Washington -- Hosni was a guest of the Getty Conservation Institute 
for four days in Los Angeles.

"Being an artist doesn't just mean that you create things but that you are a 
person of vision and imagination," said Hosni, speaking through a translator in 
his hotel room in Marina del Rey. The difficulty for artist-administrators is 
that they are inclined to be "idealistic perfectionists," he said, but they 
also have an advantage: an ability to dream. "The problem is not the artist's 
visionary point of view but the means -- the material tools -- to carry out his 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
A dashing figure who might be mistaken for a film star, Hosni said his 
childhood dreams were formed by Hollywood movies. While his visit to Los 
Angeles returned him to "the old days of American cinema" (in part through a 
tour of Universal Studios), his official purpose was to shape Egypt's cultural 
future. To that end, his itinerary was packed with meetings with museum 
administrators, ceremonial meals, visits to local cultural institutions -- the 
J. Paul Getty Museum, the Getty Conservation Institute, the Museum of 
Contemporary Art -- and a conference on "The First Egyptians: Pyramid Age and 
Before" at the Natural History Museum. 
</P>

Egypt's writers, composers and plastic artists are the strength of the 
country's contemporary culture, Hosni said. The formerly vital Egyptian film 
industry, whose products have been widely distributed in the Arab world, has 
declined for reasons not unique to Egypt: the rise of video and an increasing 
emphasis on making movies for profit, he said. Movie theaters have closed 
because Egyptians watch movies at home. "Every home has a VCR, if not two or 
three," Hosni said, and most of them show imported movies. Asked if a Muslim 
fundamentalist movement had also crippled the film industry, Hosni said that 
"at a certain point, about two or three years ago, it was a menace to the 
arts," but that threat has now "collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
Hosni said his primary challenge in promoting the arts is to find ways to put 
them on a sound economic footing and even turn them into money-making ventures. 
"The arts can be a real source of income by attracting tourism," he said, 
insisting that spotlighting the arts is also a way of raising quality. "If the 
quality is good, the art is wanted." He calls the concept "the 
industrialization of culture" and noted that other countries have found culture 
to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to show the civilized face of Egypt" to tourists, said Hosni, who 
wants that face to include more than spectacular monuments. He envisions -- and 
has already begun to work on -- performing and visual arts centers located at 
archeological sites. Contemporary artists' work would be cast in the impressive 
light of history, while "forlorn and forgotten" archeological sites would come 
to life again as venues for arts exhibitions, performances and other programs. 
Hosni plans to hit "every target. Any building or site that has its own 
character can be turned into a cultural center." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even the most forward-looking minister of culture cannot forget the 
past. The needs of Egypt's disintegrating monuments are enormous -- and these 
ancient treasures demand foreign expertise and resources. The Getty 
Conservation Institute has come to the rescue of the 3,500-year-old tomb of 
Queen Nefertari, across the Nile River from Luxor in southern Egypt. An 
international team headed by Italians is salvaging wall paintings that were 
gravely endangered by water and salts. The tomb, which has been closed since 
the early '50s, will reopen to tourists in 1991, Hosni said. 
</P>
<P>
Such success stories are tempered by the fact that Egypt has about 10,000 
archeological sites that are deteriorating at an ever-increasing rate. Urban 
encroachment, pollutants, changing water tables and tourism are all taking 
their toll. Conservation of the Giza Plateau, including pyramids and the 
Sphinx, is a $50-million job, according to Hosni. But the project is 
"completely feasible," he said. Saving "the world's first Surrealist statue" is 
"no problem," Hosni said with visionary optimism. "All we need is material and 
scientific resources."
