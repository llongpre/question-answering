   Sayed Tawfik, Egypt's chief archaeologist
and chairman of antiquities, has died of a heart attack at age 54,
friends and newspapers reported Friday.
   Tawfik, a former dean of archaeology and professor of Egyptology
at Cairo University, was the author of a half-dozen books on
Egyptian antiquities.
   As chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, he was in
charge of all restoration and conservation work on Egypt's vast
legacy of pyramids, tombs, temples and other relics threatened by
time, pollution and the demands of an exploding population.
   But among Egyptologists, Tawfik is remembered most as an
excavator, especially for his work on a windblown bluff overlooking
the ancient royal burial grounds of Sakkara south of Cairo.
   He began the excavation eight years ago. In 1985 he uncovered an
unknown burial ground from the time of Pharaoh Ramses II, tombs
hidden 33 feet below the desolate hillside that yielded a rich
store of data about some of the most important officials of the
Egypt of 3,250 years ago.
   Friends said Tawfik was at Sakkara on Thursday. That night he
suffered a heart attack and died instantly.He was buried on Friday.
   Tawfik spoke of his love for Egyptology and excavation in an
interview on Tuesday, his last.
   ``Each time I excavate, I'm rewriting history,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``Imagine that before I began the dig in Sakkara,
we never knew Ramses II had a history there. History is a puzzle,
and I'm helping to write new chapters.''
   Tawfik became chairman of antiquities in December 1988 after a
10-month battle over who or what caused a boulder to fall from the
shoulder of the Sphinx, which cost Tawfik's predecessor his job.
   Widespread concern persists over the future of the half-man,
half-beast statue at the foot of Giza Plateau.
   But Tawfik remained optimistic to the end that the Sphinx would
survive. He made weekly visits, including one Tuesday morning.
   ``I think the restoration work going on at the Sphinx is
wonderful. I'm so happy with it,'' he said.
   ``Some weeks I go once to the Sphinx, sometimes three times. If
I don't go to make sure everything is going well, the Sphinx might
sleep. And one day I'll go and it'll be gone. I must be vigilant,
fight to save the Sphinx.''
   Despite his workload, Tawfik refused to abandon his love for
excavation.
   ``Excavation is life, and what's so wonderful is each time you
go down, you are a discoverer,'' he said Tuesday.
   Survivors include Tawfik's German-born widow, Frieda; his son
Tarek, an Egyptology student at Cairo University; and daughter,
Sophie, a pupil at a German school in Cairo.
