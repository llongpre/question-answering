There were plenty of pre-birth jitters and confusion Wednesday under the 
controversial new glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum. 
</P>
<P>
As repair crews and cleaners made last-minute patrols through the acres of 
gleaming underground marble topped by the jutting 70-foot glass peak, 
distinguished American architect Ieoh Ming Pei was seen appealing to a museum 
guard to let him into a roped-off area of the new building. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am the architect," argued Pei, fumbling with his wallet in search of 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
Pei was eventually rescued by a blushing museum official. But he remained as 
nervous as an expectant father until his friend and admirer, French President 
Francois Mitterrand, formally inaugurated the impressive $300-million new 
addition to the museum Wednesday afternoon in a simple and elegant ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
After the ribbon-cutting, an enthusiastic crowd of tourists and onlookers were 
allowed to stream in, lending a spontaneous, populist feel to the grand opening 
of the structure that has been the focus of a lively French aesthetic and 
political debate for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
I. M. Pei beamed. "You are never sure about these things until they are built," 
he said. As the architect spoke, a wash of brilliant sunlight poured in through 
the crystal-clear roof -- 793 panes of glass specially made from the pure white 
sand of a quarry in Fontainebleau. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Friday, the 650,000-square-foot new addition will serve as the 
entrance and reception area for the famous museum -- home of the Mona Lisa, the 
Venus de Milo, Winged Victory of Samothrace and many other great works of art. 
</P>
<P>
American visitors (there were more than 300,000 last year) will be especially 
happy to know that the new addition will include toilets, restaurants and 
multilingual information booths conspicuously lacking in the old museum and, 
indeed, in many other French museums. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this will help the tourists in their traditional quest to find the Mona 
Lisa and other major works remains to be seen. The new color-coded orientation 
guide released last week seemed not much more illuminating than the confusing 
old model. 
</P>
<P>
However, with spacious restaurants, cafes, cloakrooms, bathrooms and even 
separate lecture rooms for group tours, visitors will at least be more 
comfortable than before during their art hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors to the museum will now enter through a door in the glass pyramid, 
situated in the central Napoleon Courtyard of the giant, horseshoe-shaped 
former palace. 
</P>
<P>
Descending on escalators or a dramatic spiral staircase, the visitors arrive at 
a reception floor with information booths, banks of television screens, a 
400-seat auditorium, a large restaurant, a cafe and the main bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
From the reception area, more escalators lead to the three separate wings of 
the reoriented museum. In digging up the courtyard to install the underground 
complex, the builders unearthed the ancient ramparts of the early palaces and 
forts on the site, which have been kept as an archeological display. 
</P>
<P>
There is also an impressive new exhibit detailing the history of the museum 
from its days as a medieval fort to its modern vision, inspired by Mitterrand, 
to become the Grand Louvre, one of the world's largest and most technologically 
advanced art museums, by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitterrand government has dedicated nearly $1 billion to this dream, which, 
along with the construction of the new Bastille Opera and a giant new national 
library, is seen as the president's personal, monumental legacy, in much the 
same way that the Arch of Triumph represented Napoleon I and the modernistic 
Pompidou Center reflects the rule of the late President Georges Pompidou. 
</P>
<P>
On a warm, bright afternoon that showed off his monument in jewel-like glory, 
Mitterrand was clearly happy. For the president, the museum and its 
controversial glass ornament had become a challenge not only to his government 
but, even more important in French eyes, to his good taste. 
</P>
<P>
Architectural critics mocked the design as "an annex to Disneyland." A Cabinet 
minister refused to move out of the building to make room for the new project. 
When construction workers made too much noise, the minister had them cited. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very difficult birth, a sale histoire (dirty episode)," said 
an aide to French Minister of Culture Jack Lang. "But on a day like this, it 
all seems worth it." After all, the political problems were solved last summer 
by the defeat of the conservative government of Premier Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
The finance minister who was reluctant to move from his wing of the Louvre was 
forced out by the voters. Lang, a Mitterrand favorite, was reinstalled as 
culture minister to supervise the new building. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Michel Laclotte declared himself happy with the results. "I 
have always been a partisan to this design," Laclotte said. "The pyramid is not 
a gadget. The reason for the pyramid is to bring light inside."
