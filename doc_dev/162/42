   British brewers and archaelogists wanting to know
how ancient Egypt made its beer plan to examine the ruins of a
brewery, read hieroglyphics and search for tiny amounts of the
liquid in ancient pottery.
   News of the three-year project, launched by a leading British
brewery and the nation's prestigious Egypt Exploration Society,
drew headlines in London newspapers on Friday.
   ``Brewers seek the Pharaohs' secret,'' said one. ``Explorers
seek the recipe for Tutankhamen's beer,'' boasted another.
   The Independent called it one of the first large-scale research
projects to be undertaken jointly by archaeologists and a
commercial British company.
   When the researchers have figured out what went into brewing
beer in ancient Egypt, the brewery will try to reproduce it at its
laboratory in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh.
   But Jim Merrington, corporate affairs director for Scottish and
Newcastle Breweries PLC, said he wasn't sure if the fine ale of the
pharoahs would be offered to tipplers in British pubs.
   ``It is highly improbable it will appear on the bar, but it is
not beyond the realms of possibility,'' he told a news conference
Thursday in Edinburgh.
   He said the project will be based largely on archaeological
excavations at Tell-el Amarna, one of Egypt's ancient capitals
located 190 miles south of Cairo.
   Archaeologists from the society, led by field director Barry
Kemp of Cambridge University, are investigating a royal brewery
there attached to a temple built by Queen Nefertiti.
   She was the leading wife of King Tutankhamen's father, the
Pharaoh Akhnaton, whose name also was spelled Akhenaten or Ikhnaton.
   Tutankhamen reigned from 1333 to 1323 B.C. His tomb was
discovered in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor in 1922. His solid
gold coffin and other fabulous treasures found inside captured the
imagination of the world.
   Merrington said Nefertiti's temple, each side of which measures
750 feet, had its own brewery and bakery for making beer and bread
for religious festivals. Both processes employ yeast.
   But no one knows what the beer tasted like.
   Ancient texts and wall paintings suggest there were several
different beers, ranging from thick gruelly ales to those of a
finer texture.
   Wall paintings from Tutankhamen's day depict courtiers vomiting
after getting drunk on beer. Another wall painting shows Nefertiti
pouring her beer through a strainer to remove lumps of gruel.
   Merrington said the archaeologists hope to find minute traces of
the beer. If they're successful, he said, scientists working for
Scottish and Newcastle would use a chemical process to test those
samples to try to determine the ancient brew's taste and
consistency.
   ``Apart from what the archaeologists give us, we hope to examine
beer residues left in pots which are now in museums in Europe,
America and Egypt,'' Merrington said. ``We will use 20th century
technology which can identify flavors to come up with a recipe.
Then we will try to brew it.''
   Researchers on the project also will examine ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphics, tomb models and written material for clues to making
the beer.
   ``The pyramids were built on a diet of bread and beer, with
bakeries and breweries operating together,'' Kemp said. ``The
ancient Egyptians baked a kind of bread first, then used it as a
mash from which to brew the beer.''
