   Thousands of visitors streamed into the refurbished
courtyard of the Louvre on Friday for their first close-up look at
a giant glass pyramid destined to be the museum's new entrance.
   President Francois Mitterrand cut a tricolored ribbon leading to
the Cour Napoleon, a vast esplanade between the museum's two main
wings that had been closed to the public for four years.
   The pyramid, 71 feet tall and costing $15 million, was designed
by I.M. Pei, also on hand for the inauguration.
   Surrounded by three smaller glass pyramids and set off by seven
triangular basins in deep blue granite, the pyramid seemed to
change with the weather _ dull gray when clouds blocked the sun,
then brilliant in the sunshine.
   ``It's like a jewel, a diamond sparkling in the outdoors,'' said
Christiane Weiler, a visitor from Toulon. ``It's much more
beautiful than I expected.''
   The Louvre, built by King Philippe Auguste in 1200 as a
fortress, underwent many structural changes according the tastes of
its inhabitants over the centuries before it became a museum after
the French Revolution in 1789.
   The pyramid had been the subject of heated debate since the
project was unveiled at the beginning of Mitterrand's term of
office. But many of Friday's visitors said they weren't shocked by
the clash of the old and the new.
   ``It's breathtaking,'' said Peggy Curran, 22, a Columbus, Ohio,
native. ``The contrast between the classical style and the pyramid
seems to sum up Paris.''
