<TEXT>     Thor Heyerdahl has come to unlock its secrets. Tanned, fit, white hair
neatly combed and blue eyes clear and direct, the 76-year-old Norwegian
explorer, made famous by his Kon-Tiki voyage 44 years ago, has calmed the
spirits and befriended the witch doctors in an effort to excavate the largest
complex of pyramids in the Americas.;    Heyerdahl is not here for fun, though
he's enjoying himself. He's on a mission -- the same one that earlier pushed
him to raft thousands of miles across treacherous oceans: to prove all
civilizations have a common heritage, to show that the pyramids he is now
excavating are linked to the pyramids of Egypt.;    Most archaeologists think
Heyerdahl is nuts, or, worse, that he manipulates facts to support his theory.
Civilizations from Egypt to Mesopotamia to America's pre-Incan cultures arose
independently, they say, and developed similar characteristics -- including
pyramid building -- because of humanity's common predilections.;    "I don't
listen to the 'know-hows,' the people who sit behind desks and think they know
everything," said Heyerdahl, relaxing in his comfortable two-story home facing
the ruins. "It is utterly illogical to think cultures developed independently
without direct contact after man developed seagoing vessels about 5,000 years
ago.";    But Richard Burger, an Andean expert and professor of anthropology
at Yale University, said Heyerdahl's theory is "idle speculation.";    "It's a
theory few professionals lend any credence to," Burger said.;    It was in
1937 on the island of Fatu Hiva, part of the South Pacific's Marquesas
Islands, that Heyerdahl found plants native to South America. Was it possible
Fatu Hiva and other Pacific islands were settled by white mariners who sailed
from South America, rather than by Asians migrating east, as most researchers
believed?;    HEYERDAHL SET OUT to prove his theory, or at least to prove it
was possible. In April 1947, he and five other Scandinavians left Peru on a
45-foot balsa-log raft called the Kon-Tiki. They landed on an island near
Tahiti 101 days later.;    The 4,300-mile voyage earned Heyerdahl
international fame. He met Harry Truman at the White House, wrote the
best-selling "Kon-Tiki," and won an Academy Award for best feature film
documentary. But the experts snickered. Heyerdahl could sail, they said, but
he didn't know anything about ancient cultures. He was stunt man posing as
scientist -- the Evel Knievel of ocean travel.;    The criticism stung.;   
"They couldn't understand how a guy from Norway who was not an academic could
do something they said couldn't be done," said Heyerdahl, his voice rising
slightly in anger. "Before Kon-Tiki, nobody thought ancient Peruvians
navigated the oceans.";    Well, maybe. Archaeologists say ancient Peruvians
sailed along the South American coast but doubt they had oceangoing vessels.
And they insist that Polynesians of Asian descent -- not South Americans --
settled Easter Island, a wedge-shaped volcanic rock 2,000 miles west of
Chile.;    In part, Heyerdahl settled in Tucume in 1988 to prove them wrong.
Despite its importance, the site had remained unexcavated because of lack of
funds and perhaps its overwhelming vastness -- 500 acres of buried ruins.;   
Some of the pyramids' gold artifacts are inlaid with seashells and rare stones
that originated thousands of miles away, something that to Heyerdahl, at
least, suggest extensive maritime travel.;    Dan Sandweiss, one of two
archaeologists Heyerdahl has hired to do the Tucume excavation, said the site
is a huge complex of ruins containing 26 large pyramids, called huacas, and
numerous smaller pyramids, courtyards and temples probably first built around
1000 A.D. by the Lambayeque people.;    "What we immediately discovered is a
culture not just based on agriculture, but on fishing and long-range maritime
trade," said Heyerdahl. Sandweiss says the finds indicate only that the
Lambayeque had "some maritime ability.";    But Heyerdahl is as convinced of
his thesis as ever. And even if he remains a pariah in the halls of academia,
the people of this dusty town have welcomed him warmly -- theories and all.  </TEXT>
