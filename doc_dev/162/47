   A British tourist fell to his death after he
illegally climbed the Great Pyramid, then dozed off, authorities
said Monday.
   Peter Harold Flanagan apparently climbed the 482-foot pyramid
Saturday night, a British Embassy spokesman said. His body was
found Sunday beside the monument, the largest of the three Giza
pyramids, said John Hillman, an embassy official.
   An officer at Giza police station said Flanagan apparently was
alone on his climb and that foul play was not suspected. He did not
explain how authorities knew Flanagan, 21, fell asleep before
toppling to his death.
   Pyramid climbing has been done for centuries. Records show more
than 1,600 climbers have died in the past 200 years, and at least
200 of them in the last 50 years.
   The last reported death was in 1980 when Susanne Urban, a
21-year-old American, was killed in a fall.
   Pyramid climbing was banned in 1951 but enforcement has been lax.
