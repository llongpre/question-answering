   After years of bitter controversy, a gleaming and
renovated Louvre museum, crowned by a tall glass pyramid at its
entrance, is scheduled to open next week.
   For months, many Frenchmen and art lovers worldwide have been
holding their breath, waiting for a look at the high-tech,
ultra-modern facilities designed to turn a once-exhausting tour of
the Louvre's dark and dingy galeries into sunny joy.
   The six-year, $850-million overhaul will turn the Louvre into the
world's largest museum once the last of its 14 new galleries opens
in 1993.
   The pyramid entrance will be inaugurated next Wednesday by
President Francois Mitterrand and will open to the public on
Thursday.
   Visitors who once wandered in search of the museum's main
entrance won't have any trouble finding the new one. It soars
dramatically between the Louvre's two main wings, is set off by
three smaller pyramids and fountains illuminated at night.
   A graceful spiral staircase takes visitors down to a spacious
underground lobby where they will find ticket windows, bookshops,
restaurants, boutiques and a 400-seat auditorium.
   From below, the view is breathtaking: the ornate architecture of
the Louvre's twin towers looms against the ever-changing grays of
the Paris sky.
   Visitors will also find video screens indicating in several
languages which galeries are closed as well as the best routes for
finding key items like the ``Mona Lisa'' and ``Winged Victory.''
   With about 650,000 square feet of new space, dozens of important
works have been dusted off and put on display for the first time in
decades.
   Aficionados of 16th and 17th century French painters will
probably love the newly restored galleries on the third floor of the
Cour Carre overlooking the pyramid.
   Works to be shown there include ``The History of Alexander,'' a
huge, four-panel 17th century wall mural by Charles Lebrun not seen
in public since 1963. The 18th century ``The Meal at Simon's'' by
Pierre Subleyras, never displayed at the Louvre, will also grace the
walls.
   The guards will be dressed in chic new navy-blue outfits designed
by Yves Saint Laurent.
   The brainchild of French President Francois Mitterrand, the
Louvre project was plunged in controversy from the start. Problems
arose when Mitterrand picked celebrated American architect I.M. Pei
to design the project, bypassing the traditional architectural
competition.
   Pei's design _ a 70-foot pyramid of special thick, tinted glass
soaring between the Louvre's main wings _ was cause for further
outrage. Critics lambasted the clash of new and old, complaining
that the pyramid would turn the Louvre into a subway entrance or
``Disneyland annex.''
   Turning a centuries-old palace into a space-age museum was no
easy task. Before the pyramid went up, teams of archeologists worked
day and night excavating centuries of ruins under the courtyard.
   They unearthed thousands of artifacts as ancient as items from
the 13th century. Some of things they found _ animal bones,
porcelain dinnerware, cooking utensils, vases and pitchers, 200
silver coins dating from the French Revolution, and even common
latrines _ will be put on display.
   They will be used to tell the Louvre's history.
   The museum was built in 1200 by King Philippe Auguste as a walled
fortress to help protect Paris from English invaders.
   In the 1600s, the austere castle was made more livable but did
not become a royal residence until King Louis XIII made it bigger to
accommodate his ever-expanding court.
   A century later, after Louis XIV deserted the Louvre for more
sumptous quarters at Versailles, the Louvre declined. It was
gradually taken over by artists' colonies and turned into a museum
in 1793.
