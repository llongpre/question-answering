   Treasures even greater than those in King
Tut's tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of Egypt.
   ``When I'm asked if there's another Tut's tomb out there, I
always answer at least one, maybe more,'' said Zahi Hawass, director
of the Giza pyramids area outside Cairo and the huge ancient
cemetery of Sakkara, 11 miles to the south.
   ``My guess is we've found no more than 30 percent of what's
buried. After all, Egypt is 97 percent desert. ... We can't begin to
imagine what the sands have hidden.''
   The tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun _ King Tut _ was found almost
intact in 1922 by the British archaeologist Howard Carter.
   It took Carter 11 years more to document the hoard of gold,
semiprecious stones, furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the
makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern Egypt's Valley of the
Kings.
   But Tutankhamun was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb
left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied
ancient Egypt's great monarchs into the afterlife.
   Some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists
and their modern successors:
   _Mummies and relics of Pharaoh Cheops, whose pyramid on Giza
Plateau is among the world's best-known monuments.
   _The tomb of the architect Imhotep at Sakkara, where more than
4,600 years ago he built for Pharaoh Zozer a step pyramid, an
architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid.
Generations of later Egyptians worshipped Imhotep as a god.
   _At least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the New
Kingdom, the era of Tutankhamun and the Ramses line.
   _The tomb of Alexander the Great, the young Macedonian conqueror
who died at the age of 33 in 323 B.C. Records say he wanted to be
buried in Egypt's Siwa Oasis, near Libya, but finally was encased in
a gold coffin in Alexandria, the Mediterranean city he founded.
   _The 50,000-man army of Persian conqueror Cambyses, which
vanished in a sandstorm in 525 B.C. while en route to Siwa to punish
the powerful priests of the temple of the Siwan Oracle.
   Egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those
finds would entail. But the mammoth job of preserving what is said
already to be the world's greatest national storehouse of
antiquities has halted treasure hunts.
   ``I'm trying to keep what's standing, standing,'' said Sayed
Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. ``What
I'd like to do is to keep what's buried, buried until we can deal
with it. It's usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to
modern pollutants.''
   As Egypt's population rapidly expands, however, roadways, gas
lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just
beneath the ground. Often, excavations are rescue missions.
   Archaeological work in Egypt generally is restricted to the
cooler winter months, and last season's work was filled with
surprises. Giza director Hawass said the results give a glimpse of
what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in September.
   In January five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest
artwork the ancient Egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit
beneath the tourist-trampled courtyard of Luxor Temple. Seventeen
more statues, many broken, later were discovered in the cache.
   In March a mummy of a young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in
a gypsum mask, was found on Giza Plateau a few feet from a roadway
through the pyramids.
   Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on
sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by
paved roads.
   One area to be surveyed in the fall is Giza Plateau's East
Cemetery, a Pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside
Cheops pyramid.
   ``I'm sure we're going to find an intact burial of a prince or
official, because the area never has been excavated properly,''
Hawass said.
   ``In Sakkara, where we know Imhotep is buried, you don't even
need to have shovels and picks to find tombs. You can just use your
hands, dig in the sand. They're there.''
   Modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests,
who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically
troubled times, Hawass said. These caches, which may explain the
Luxor Temple statues, give clues to what may still be hidden.
   He believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache
from the reign of Old Kingdom Pharaoh Cheops, whose relics include
the world's largest pyramid, a full-sized boat and an ivory statue
so small it can be held between two fingers.
   ``I think out there is Cheops' mummy, maybe statues, maybe
personal items,'' Hawass said.
   ``Four priests were in charge of their safety, but in the next
dynasty (after Cheops) his memory soured. There was a revolt. His
monuments were damaged, perhaps because he made himself a god.''
   Hawass believes that like the Luxor find the Cheops discovery
will be accidental.
   ``We have magnificent statues of his successors (and) delicate
funerary items of Cheops' mother, ... so we know such things did
exist,'' he said.
   ``One day you'll be digging a power line, or cleaning, and there
they'll be.''
   Hawass thinks chance also may locate the long-sought tomb of
Alexander the Great in Alexandria.
   ``We have early descriptions of his tomb, but Alexandria has gone
through many changes,'' he said.
   ``We're not going to find the tomb, if it even still exists, by
going after it. We'll find it by accident, when somebody's digging a
foundation for a house or installing sewer lines.''
   Hawass insists that people who think incredible discoveries
remain to be found aren't dealing in fantasy.
   ``We've got too much evidence,'' he said: ``Kings without tombs,
places we know existed but never were found.''
