   Indiana Jones and his swashbuckling treasure
hunts would have been at home in Egypt in the early 1800s, when a
mix of travelers and adventurers became _ by chance _ the world's
first Egyptologists.
   The calling still retained a lot of Harrison Ford's movie
character in 1922 when Howard Carter, an eccentric Briton, dug into
the most famous tomb of all, the gold-packed burial place of Pharaoh
Tutankhamon.
   But as Egyptology prepares to enter the 21st century, the country
that gave the science its name is asking modern lovers of its
ancient past to give up the shovel and trowel. Don't dig and
destroy, Egyptian antiquities officials are saying, but restore and
rebuild.
   ``Our grandfathers, the ancient Egyptians, were reaching for
eternity,'' the acting chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization, M.A. Nur-el-din, told the fifth annual International
Congress of Egyptology. ``It's our task to let them remain eternal.
It's time we looked on the ancient Egyptians as subjects, not just
objects.''
   To thousands of years of wayfarers, Egypt's monuments have seemed
immortal, a rich and glorious past paraded in stone monoliths and on
tomb walls. Evidence is growing, however, that the immortality was
fleeting: Time is running out.
   ``New artifacts keep coming up at new digs ... (but) where are we
going?'' said Egyptology professor Faiza Haikal. ``We must leave the
artifacts safely buried in the ground (and) restore and preserve
what has been unearthed.
   ``The once slow process of deterioration is accelerating. We have
the usual problems of environment and a rising water table, but now
the monuments face the spread of settlements, with sewage and other
risks.''
   Most scholars are aware of, and strongly support, the changing
face of Egyptology, its shift from seeking treasure to seeking
knowledge. Many of today's Egyptologists spend their days before
delicately painted walls or engraved columns, copying pictures and
writings that are disappearing at a frightening rate.
   Others dig, but in remote sites or at the edges of villages whose
high birth rates demand the use of all available land, whether or
not history lies beneath it.
   Unlike the tomb of the boy pharoah Tutankhamun, discovered almost
in tact and containing hordes of treasure beyond belief, many sites
in Egypt contain only fragments only _ pottery pieces rich enough
for the scholar but perhaps not substantial enough to raise funds
for the ever increasing price of mounting expeditions.
   Hundreds of subjects tantalize modern Egyptologists, ranging from
pyramid research and the Sphinx, to the secret language of the
baboons, Egypt in the Old Testament, magic in ancient Egypt, adverbs
and adverb clauses, the position of Tutankhamun's feathered corselet
against iconographical sources, the role of the handicapped people
in ancient Egypt, the transition from tribe to state and some
aspects of the use of honey in ancient Egypt.
   The profession has come a long way from the image of the solitary
Egyptologist trotting over desert sands on his faithful donkey,
wind-blasted and poor, trying to fight off eternity-starved mummies
and antiquities smugglers with baskets of tana leaves.
   Gamal Mokhtar, director for the international effort to save the
monuments of Nubia during the 1960s, has witnessed many of the
changes, including the passing of Egypt's heritage from foreign to
local hands and items of national heritage required to be kept in
Egypt.
   ``Egyptology as a science began after different evils,'' he said.
``You had monumental neglect of the monuments from the days of the
pharoahs. Then you had Christians and the monuments on religious
grounds.
   ``Then you had ... Napoleon Bonaparte bringing with him in his
attempt to conquer Egypt hundreds of artists and scientists, who
awakened the eyes of the world to the glories that still could be
found in Egypt.''
   Hundreds came either to study or steal, he said. Then, in 1799,
the Rosetta Stone _ with its ancient Greek and Egyptian inscriptions
_ was found, providing a key to deciphering the hidden meaning of
ancient Egyptian writing (hieroglyphics).
   Mokhtar has also witnessed high technology replacing hands in an
attempt to locate hidden artifacts. Satellite photos provide what
years of walking might never show. In some large sites, instruments
replace the questioning mind, showing just the spot where buried
history can be found, though seldom indicating exactly what lies
below.
   But for most Egyptologists dirt-under-the fingernails is still
where it's at.
   ``You know what things are by touching them,'' said archaeologist
and Egyptologist Michael Jones. ``You won't know what glass is
except when you feel it, though high technology has its place.
   For the past five years Jones and his wife, Egyptologist Angelea
Milward, have searched for clues to one of the most important
religious relics in ancient Egypt, the Apis bull, on a site
surrounded by a village some 45 minutes south of Cairo.
   Though they were not searching for treasure and have found
nothing of great value, they are content that they have added facts
missing from the pages of ancient Egypt.
   ``Up until the 19th century, much of ancient Egypt was frozen in
time,'' Jones said. ``Because there was wealth still buried in
Egypt, people came looking for goodies and found them. It's a great
tragedy, because lay people nowadays are mesmerized, knocked over
backwards by Tutankhamun and the famous statues.''
   For today's Egyptologist working in the field, the goal is to
band together the facts in order to reveal a three dimensional side
to what has been found.
   ``But it's difficult,'' Jones said, ``because many of the
artifacts have been taken from their home. We have parts of
monuments, other parts remaining in museums and elsewhere out of
Egypt. Physical remains are often seen in isolation.
   ``Imagine someone 3,000 years from now trying to recreate our
world?''
   Jones said there are few shortcuts in his profession. He walks
and walks his site, then walks it again, trying to turn back the
clock.
   ``You get to know your site the way you know your house,'' he
said.
   ``What's happening in Egyptology is the ancient Egyptians are no
longer the curiosities they once were. You can meet them via
archaeology and not in the fancified terms Egyptologists used in the
old days.
   ``You try to understand them in their own environment. You're not
just digging up artifacts; you're digging up people.''
