   At age 75, Thor Heyerdahl is digging in a
remote area near the coast of Peru for treasures left by a
civilization be believes is older and more advanced than the
celebrated Incas of the Andes.
   More than 40 years earlier, Heyerdahl set sail from the same
Peruvian coast for Polynesia on the Kon-Tiki, the primitive wooden
raft that first carried him to fame.
   Heyerdahl is exploring a sprawling complex called the Tucume
pyramids, which he believes were built by ancient seafarers who
reached the new world on fragile rafts like Kon-Tiki about the time
of Christ or before.
   ``This is the greatest archeological find of the century. ...
It's the most exciting project of my life,'' a trim Heyerdahl said
in an interview while in Norway recently to celebrate his birthday
at his boyhood home in Larvik, a southern town of 38,000 people.
   Heyerdahl said he was introduced to the Tucume find by the
Peruvian archaeologist Walter Alva.
   Work on the 26-pyramid complex began last year, but ``an area of
this size is not studied in one man's lifetime,'' Heyerdahl said.
``It will take generations.''
   The find, he said, may cast doubt on current theories about the
settlers of ancient America.
   The pyramids were made of adobe, a material most often used in
those times in distant Mesopotamia, the region near what now is
Iraq, he said.
   He added that he is certain he will find a treasure of gold and
artifacts when he opens the ancient tombs.
   The complex in northwest Peru is linked to the sea by a 12-mile
system of canals big enough for rafts like Kon-Tiki to sail
through, he said. The canals once were filled in but later dredged
out for irrigation channels.
   ``One of the first utensils we found was a small steering oar
from a small balsa raft,'' Heyerdahl said.
   Seashells and stones from distant parts of South America found
there also indicate that the builders of Tucume were an ancient
race of sailors, he said.
   Spanish explorers found the coastal complex in the 1500s, but
they continued into the Andes in search of Inca treasure ``and
Tucome was forgotten by the world,'' Heyerdahl said.
   Oral histories of coastal dwellers recorded by the Spaniards
told of fleets of rafts that brought King Nymlap at least 2,000
years ago. Legend has it that his grandson, Kala, started work on
the pyramids, Heyerdahl said.
   ``I could only prove that balsa rafts were seaworthy and could
sail,'' he said of his 101-day, 4,300-mile voyage on the Kon-Tiki
in 1947. ``Here we have the final proof that they did sail and they
did navigate in the open ocean.''
   Heyerdahl set out on Kon-Tiki in an attempt to prove his theory
that prehistoric civilizations reached the Americas from across the
Pacific on rafts carried by ocean currents.
   He said he and his researchers had not yet determined when the
people who built Tucume arrived in Peru. But he added that the find
predates the Incas and even the Chimo, a tribe vanquished by the
Incas about 1100 A.D.
   ``By the time we finish excavation we will be able to say when
it all started,'' he said.
   ``The Incas were to South America what the Romans were in
Europe. They were not the founders of culture. They were the
military power that took over what others had created.''
   Though the origins are obscure, Heyerdahl said, it is clear the
Tucume civilization was wiped out.
   ``There are many lessons in the past and one lesson is that not
one civilization has been eternal,'' he said.
