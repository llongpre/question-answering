   Stone-faced Dallas Cowboys Coach Tom Landry was
the closest thing to the Sphinx ever seen in Giants Stadium _ until
now.
   A 55-foot replica of the Egyptian wonder is coming to New Jersey
in June for a spectacular $7 million production of the opera
``Aida.''
   While most operas aren't over 'til the fat lady sings, this one
won't be done until 1,200 cast members, a 100-piece orchestra, a
menagerie of exotic animals and the eight-ton Sphinx are paraded
through Giants Stadium for two nights.
   Promoters are hoping for 39,000 people each night for the June
1-2 shows, not including Jimmy Hoffa, the ex-Teamsters boss
allegedly buried in one end zone.
   The promoters are also aware that a stadium off the New Jersey
Turnpike, deep in the heart of Bruce Springsteen country, is not
the usual spot for a musical work that premiered 119 years ago in
Cairo.
   So they're going for the hard sell, sending costumed Egyptian
wannabes to shopping malls in an effort to plug the show. Ads in
the local media proclaim ``THINK SPHINX,'' while ad copy trumpets
``The Opera Spectacular.''
   Twenty New Jersey malls were targeted for the blitz, with folks
dressed as Aida, Radames, Egyptian soldiers and high priests
spreading out from a midtown Manhattan motel and heading into the
Garden State.
   Giants Stadium is the latest stop for the opera, which is billed
as the biggest production of any opera, ever. ``Aida'' has played
in Montreal, Sydney, Melbourne, Vancouver, Tokyo and Toronto in the
past two years. In Japan, 102,000 people attended.
   But ``Aida'' is more than an opera, said Tony Attanasio, who has
been training the mall roamers. Verdi wrote his grand opera with
jugglers, animals and dancers, designed for grand-scale popular
entertainment, the publicist said.
   Maestro Giuseppe Raffa, who is directing the production, said
``opera is for the people'' rather than the privileged few.
Attanasio said auditions for the opera's 500 extras bear the
maestro out.
   ``In Australia, we had the president of the government, the
president of the largest company, two Olympic medal winners.
Everybody tried out. Nobody has special privilege,'' Attanasio said.
   ``Everybody has in the back of his head the dream of being in
show business once in his life.''
   Casting for many of the Giants Stadium extras has already been
held at Sleepy Hollow High School in Tarrytown, N.Y. Everyone
chosen gets two $35 seats _ tickets also are sold at $50 and $75 _
a sweatshirt and an invite to the cast party.
   A May 5 audition for 200 soldiers will be held in Central Park.
   Raffa, 38, got the idea for the traveling spectacular after
watching Italian film director Mauro Bolognini direct ``Aida'' in
Giza, Egypt, with the real Sphinx and Pyramids in the background.
   The 1987 show inspired him to put together the financing and
hire Bolognini, the set producer and the costume designer.
   The traveling ``Aida'' had to build sand dunes, Pyramids, the
Nile and a Sphinx. They went the real thing one better, putting
motors and drivers inside the 55-foot, eight-ton replica Sphinx and
letting it split and show its profile on each side of the stage
during the Triumphal Entry scene.
   After Giants Stadium, ``Aida'' will play the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum June 29 and 30, San Francisco in mid-July and
possibly Washington, D.C., in September. Grace Bumbry of the United
States will sing Aida, Bruno Sebastian of Italy will sing Radames
and Ruza Baldani of Yugoslavia will sing Amneris.
   A giant screen on each side of the stage will show closeups and
the words in English. A $1 million amplification system has been
built in Holland.
   But the ``Aida'' production will not bring the only Sphinx to
Giants Stadium this summer. The rock band Kiss is coming to town in
the summer, and their stage show will feature a towering version of
the Egyptian monument too _ one with an attitude, promised Kiss
vocalist Paul Stanley.
   ``Ours is going to talk, and it hates opera,'' Stanley said.
