   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, the most
famous of ancient Egypt's royal tombs, was declared safe for
tourists and reopened Saturday for the first time in nine months.
   A Dutch woman and an American student were the first of the
scores of tourists who waited under the hot Egyptian sun to tour
the pyramid.
   Since August, workers had been sealing cracks, reinforcing
limestone slabs for safety and clearing vermin from the inside of
the magnificent structure, which now boasts television monitors.
   The restoration project was the first step in a five-year plan
to transform the pyramid area, including the Sphinx, into an
open-air museum.
   Gasping after the 155-foot climb to the King's Chamber, Sophie
D'Lang of Rotterdam said she and her husband were spending the last
day of a vacation in Egypt.
   ``I didn't think we had a chance to see inside Cheops,'' said
Mrs. D'Lang, who waited more than three hours for the re-opening.
``I think what they've done is great.''
   Michael Saxton of Dayton, Ohio, said he waited four hours. ``For
me the pyramid has special meaning because of the way it's built.
It's amazing.''
   The Great Pyramid is Egypt's top tourist attraction, and tourist
officials protested when it was closed Aug. 15.
   But the Egyptian Antiquities Organization prevailed with the
argument that newly discovered cracks in blocks lining interior
passages and a half-inch layer of salt on inside walls had to be
fixed without interruption by tourists.
   With a base of 13.1 acres, it stood at 481.4 feet when it was
built 4,600 years ago. Today, it is 31 feet shorter after losing
about a dozen layers and its capstone. It also has lost almost all
its outer facing of hard, white limestone, stripped for use in
stone bridges, irrigation canals, houses, walls and buildings.
   Zahi Hawass, director general of the pyramids area, said nothing
had been done to restore the pyramid's interior since it was opened
in the late 1830s.
   Hawass said in removing salt from the limestone walls, restorers
found weak and cracking rock throughout the pyramid.
   In the Grand Gallery, Hawass said, 500 limestone blocks were
restored and 16 granite slabs reinforced with stainless steel bars.
``Some of these slabs were in critical condition,'' he said.
   Cheops' lidless red granite sarcophagus, soiled by the touch of
generations of tourists, was cleaned of soot, grease and other
filth, Hawass said.
   He said insects and rats, which had invaded the pyramid, were
exterminated. Television monitors were installed to ensure that
visitors behave themselves.
   During the renovation, rubble was cleared and lighting added to
a chamber winding 396 feet beneath the pyramid, opening it to
tourists for the first time.
   Of the seven monuments listed as Wonders of the World by Greeks
of the second century B.C., only Cheops and the other two large
Giza pyramids remain intact.
   The remaining monuments on the list _ the statue of Zeus in
Olympia, Artemis' temple in Ephesus, the Colossus of Rhodes, the
mausoleum of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor and the Pharos lighthouse
in Alexandria _ were destroyed by warfare or earthquakes.
