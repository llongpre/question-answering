   As Barbara Bush looked on, girls in billowy
pink and blue pants gyrated to Arabic music. Others, wearing fancy
leotards, demonstrated aerobics. A serious little boy read poetry
in Arabic.
   While their husbands conferred about the Persian Gulf crisis,
Mrs. Bush and her Egyptian counterpart, Suzanne Mubarak, toured a
children's library.
   The children had several questions for the American first lady.
   Why did she marry George Bush?
   ``Because he's the nicest, friendliest, funniest, warmest,
wisest person I've ever known,'' she said.
   How does she feel as wife of the president of the United States?
   ``I feel very, very lucky. Sometimes I feel a little bit of a
burden. There is so much to do, and you don't have the time.
Sometimes you want to do better.''
   What are you going to ask for from Santa Claus?
   ``I'm going to ask Santa Claus for peace. How about that?''
   The kids applauded and cheered.
   That was as near to politics as the questions came, although
Mrs. Bush's 9-year-old guide, Sherif Hashem, told a reporter he had
wanted to ask her about the resignation of British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. A teacher advised him not to, he said.
   Later, a reporter did the job for Sherif. The resigned British
leader will be missed, Mrs. Bush said, ``but that's not the end of
our friendship with Mrs. Thatcher. We'll see her again and again -
she's a friend.''
   Mrs. Bush said she was proud of the U.S. troops deployed in
Saudi Arabia and that she was glad to have shared Thanksgiving with
them.
   Mrs. Bush, wearing khaki slacks and a camouflage jacket,
traveled with the president to two military encampments in the
Saudi desert and to a U.S. warship off the Persian Gulf coast. She
ate turkey with the troops and promised some she would call their
relatives.
   ``My husband and I both felt very moved by those wonderful young
men and women. I, like everybody else, hope that this will end
peacefully,'' she said.
   The children waved little American flags, distributed by the
U.S. Embassy, and posed for a souvenir photo with Mrs. Bush and
Mrs. Mubarak. Mrs. Bush was given a tapestry made by one of the
children.
   Security was heavy at the library, and at the Egyptian Museum,
which Mrs. Bush also visited. The museum, which houses 100,000
artifacts from 5,000 years of Egyptian civilization, was closed to
the public all morning, and American security men with an
explosive-sniffing dog meticulously examined press equipment.
   Egyptian intelligence personnel stood watch in the museum
corridors.
   The glass-encased mummy of Pharaoh Ramses II, usually covered
with a blue cloth to protect it from camera flashes, was uncovered
for the occasion. One of the most delicate of the ancient Egyptian
relics, Ramses II's mummy, traveled to France in 1976 for treatment
against decay.
   ``He's well now,'' Mrs. Bush said as Zahi Hawass, director of
antiquities at the Pyramids area, related the mummy's history to
the first ladies.
