   About 20,000 people lined up Tuesday to visit the
ancient pyramid of Gaius Cestius in Rome, which was opened to the
public for the first time in three centuries.
   Many people stood on line for three hours to get a glimpse of
the interior of the 88-foot-tall tomb of Roman official Gaius
Cestius, built in 12 B.C. as part of the wall surrounding Rome.
   Italy's Culture Ministry opened the monument for only one day to
mark the holiday commemorating the country's liberation by the
Allies in World War II.
   In the past, the pyramid has been open by special appointment
only.
   Laura Venditelli, an archaeological expert who supervises the
monument, said it was unlikely the pyramid would be opened again
any time soon.
   ``It is not repeatable because of problems with conserving the
monument, which today is subjected to a great amount of stress,''
she said.
