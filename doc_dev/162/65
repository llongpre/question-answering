   Grave robbers came within 3 feet of making
off with the contents of the most valuable ancient tomb ever found
in the Western Hemisphere before Peruvian archaeologists with the
help of police beat them to it.
   Thus was saved the tomb of the Great Lord of Sipan, which one
American specialist says ranks with King Tut's tomb in Egypt as one
of the world's most important looks back to ancient times.
   The Sipan discovery was announced Sept. 13 by the National
Geographical Society in Washington, D.C., but details of how close
the grave robbers had come and how they worked were made known
recently here at the site.
   ``They were close to reaching him,'' said Walter Alva, director
of Peru's Bruning Archaeological Musuem, which conducted the
excavation. ``If they had, they would have destroyed his tomb and
we would not now have a discovery of incalculable value that will
allow us to know better the ancient Peruvians.''
   The archaeologists were tipped off to the grave robbers by other
robbers angry because they were not included in the plan.
   The robbers, who worked around the clock with a system of
sentries, succeeded in making off with peripheral treasures, but
the tomb itself was found intact by the archaeologists who were
able to perserve its contents and clues to a warring people who
preceded the Incas and made a desert bloom.
   But it took a police raid and gunplay near the site to finally
secure the area for the archaelogists to move in.
   The Great Lord of Sipan, a name given him by archaeologists,
ruled over a vast desert kingdom in what now is northern Peru. He
died in his mid-30s and lay unmolested for 1,500 years before the
grave robbers started their encroachment.
   His burial chamber contained finely crafted gold jewelry worth
half a million dollars and more than 1,200 ceramic vessels with
painted scenes of daily life of the Moche people, one of the
earliest civilizations of the Americas.
   The tomb, found on the upper platform of a pyramid near the
coastal village of Sipan 500 miles northwest of Lima, has
astonished archaeologists for its wealth and the information it
contains about a little known culture.
   The find also has focused a spotlight on the shadowy world of
international artifact smuggling and its impact on Peru, an
impoverished nation without the resources to protect and
investigate hundreds of pre-Columbian temples.
   ``This is the richest tomb ever excavated archaeologically in
the Western Hemisphere. The quality of the gold work is stunning,''
Dr. Christopher Donnan, an expert on ancient Peru, told a news
conference in Washington when the discovery was announced at the
headquarters of the National Geographic Society, which financed the
excavation.
   The importance of the tomb's contents to archaeology ranks with
the discovery in 1922 of King Tutankhamen's burial place in Egypt,
Donnan said. He is the director of the Museum of Cultural History
at the University of California at Los Angeles.
   The cache contained, among other items, a gold face mask, a
2-foot-wide solid gold crown, a gold knife, two strands of large
gold and silver beads shaped like peanuts and a gold warrior's
shield weighing almost 2 pounds.
   The Lord of Sipan was a warrior-priest with administrative
powers. He was about 35 at death and was 5{ feet tall.
   Buried with him were a dog, apparently a favorite pet; a child;
three young women, possibly wives or concubines; and three men,
including one believed to be a sentry, whose feet had been cut off
to prevent him from abandoning his duty of guarding the tomb in the
next life.
   ``Imagine the power he had! All those people were sacrificed and
entombed with him,'' said Luis Chero, resident archaeologist at the
site. ``He was a great lord with absolute control over the lives of
his subjects.'
   The tomb was at one end of a ceremonial, adobe-brick platform
230 feet long, 166 feet wide and 33 feet high.
   The 150-foot-high pyramid, called Huaca Rajada by local
villagers, juts up out of miles of surrounding sugar cane fields,
some of them still watered by canals built by the Moche, according
to Juan Martinez, an archaeologist on the excavation.
