   Experts hope a boat found near a pharoah's
pyramid will answer questions about ancient Egypt, but they're not
studying the way it was built _ they're looking at the wood it's
made of.
   ``There are 2{ centuries of information in one piece of wood
from that boat,'' says Peter I. Kuniholm, a Cornell University
archaeologist and tree-ring expert who is studying pencil-like
cores drilled out of the planks of the 30-foot-long boat probably
buried more than 3,800 years ago in Dashur.
   It and three similar boats were buried near the pyramid complex
of Senwosret III so he could use them in the afterlife, says Diana
Craig Patch, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History Egyptologist.
   Industrialist Andrew Carnegie bought the boat in 1901 and
shipped it from Egypt to Pittsburgh. Two of the others are at the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the third is at the Field Museum of
Natural History in Chicago.
   Kuniholm hopes rings in the samples will pinpoint the boat's age
and create a framework to help date Egyptian objects and determine
when events occurred.
   Dendrochronology, the science of tree ring dating, was
established in 1930 when Andrew E. Douglass of the University of
Arizona studieaille said.
   ``You take living trees of a particular species in a particular
area, and you measure the pattern of wide and narrow rings,'' he
said. ``You can then go back to ancient timbers from buildings, for
example, and measure the ring patterns, and if they overlap in
time, you should be able to link those patterns together.
   ``You're basically piecing together this master pattern, which
is anchored at the present day.''
