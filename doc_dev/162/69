   While her husband took care of official business
Wednesday, Raisa Gorbachev visited the newly renovated Louvre and
admired the striking bronze and marble sculptures at the Rodin
Museum.
   Applauding tourists welcomed the Soviet first lady at both spots,
and she stopped several times to shake hands with with admirers.
   The museum visits were Mrs. Gorbachev's only public appearances
Wednesday apart from her husband of 36 years, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   They are staying in a palace for foreign heads of state near the
expensive stores of the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, but Mrs.
Gorbachev has made no shopping forays, perhaps to avoid criticism at
home for extravagance.
   Her lifestyle is resented by many Soviet citizens who must cope
with shortages that make basic goods like soap and matches difficult
to find. A member of the new Soviet legislature even likened Mrs.
Gorbachev to Napoleon's wife and claimed her influence would doom
her husband.
   During their last visit to Paris, soon after her husband became
Kremlin leader in 1985, Mrs. Gorbachev enjoyed a parade of minks,
satins and other luxury clothes at the fashion house of Pierre
Cardin and sipped champagne at the Closerie des Lilas, a writers'
haunt on the Left Bank.
   On her tour Wednesday, she was accompanied by Danielle
Mitterrand, wife of President Francois Mitterrand.
   Mrs. Gorbachev entered the Louvre under the 70-foot-high glass
pyramid, passing hundreds of waiting visitors lined up in the
Napoleon courtyard.
   The pyramid, centerpiece of the $850 million renovation, tops
three underground levels containing a vast main hall, library,
information desks, galleries and storage space.
   With Culture Minister Jack Lang as her guide, she toured the
vestiges of the first Louvre castle built by King Philippe Auguste
in 1200 as a military stronghold to protect Paris from English
invaders.
   On the specially built wooden walkways in soft yellow light, she
looked at the restored ruins, including the base of the castle keep
and turrets of the thick stone wall that once surrounded it.
   ``It is fascinating to find oneself all of a sudden in the center
of Paris transported back to the 12th century,'' Mrs. Gorbachev
said. ``I am happy to have the chance to see all these beautiful
things and get to know more about French culture.''
   She did not get to see the museum's three main attractions _ the
Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo and Winged Victory of Samothrace _ but did
receive a silk scarf as a gift from the museum staff and presented
two Soviet art books to Curator Michel Laclotte.
   Then her motorcade was off to the Left Bank and the works of
Auguste Rodin, and a disappointment. The sculpture she most wanted
to see, ``Sleep,'' is on exhibit in New York.
   ``Too bad,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said. ``I guess I'll have to come
back.''
   She told Curator Jacques Vilain she had visited the museum once
before, but did not say when and Soviet officials did not know.
   After looking at ``The Hand of God,'' ``The Cathedral,'' ``The
Kiss'' and several other works, she ended her tour in the garden,
before the sculpture of ``The Thinker.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev called her visit to the museum ``an unforgettable
souvenir of Paris.''
