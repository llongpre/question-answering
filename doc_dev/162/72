   When promoter Sidney Shlenker first dropped into Memphis,
Tenn., officials were elated. Mr. Shlenker held out hopes of
making a world-class tourist attraction out of the city's
proposed Great American Pyramid, a sports arena to be shaped
like the famous pyramids near the Egyptian city that is
Memphis' namesake.
   But this week, the city and county mayors said they were
terminating Mr. Shlenker's Pyramid contracts when he failed,
after 26 months, to come up with $80 million in financing for
the project.

   Now, Memphis is left with a cavernous 32-story pyramid,
just north of its downtown, that's all but vacant except for
a basketball arena. It is the latest in a series of troubled
downtown projects designed to make tourists think of Memphis
as more than just Elvis Presley's hometown.
   The mayors' action involves two contracts between the
local governments and Mr. Shlenker's firm, Pyramid Cos. Under
the agreements, Pyramid was to manage the sports area and to
develop a host of other music and sports attractions that
would fill the facility. A separate contract, which remains
in effect, gave Mr. Shlenker management rights to Mud Island,
the city's Mississippi River theme park.
   Yesterday, Mr. Shlenker wasn't available for comment and a
secretary said that he wasn't talking to the press.
   The demise of Mr. Shlenker's project is just the latest
disappointment to Memphis' economic-development efforts.
After a decade of expansion, the city suffered a severe blow
in April when Holiday Inn, a major employer and long a source
of local pride, said it would move its headquarters to
Atlanta.
   In addition, two smaller manufacturing operations closed
their plants, and the city recently lost a bid to get NWA
Inc.'s Northwest Airlines' new maintenance hub. These losses
"have shaken people's confidence in the real successes of the
1980s," said David Ciscel, an economics professor at Memphis
State University.
   Still, while setbacks with the Pyramid may leave Memphis
with egg on its face, they shouldn't give the city any
serious budget problems. While many cities are having budget
troubles these days, Memphis isn't. Memphis will end the year
with a budget surplus, according to Mayor Richard Hackett.
"We've had 75 consecutive months of economic growth," he
said.
   Mr. Shlenker, a former majority owner of the Denver
Nuggets basketball team, wowed city officials with brash
gimmicks. For his initial sales pitch, he brought along a
magician who made a model of the Pyramid disappear, and he
had a 600-pound shovel delivered by helicopter for the
groundbreaking ceremony.
   Mr. Shlenker also produced studies that said the Pyramid
could bring in as many as three million visitors annually and
even compared the project to France's Eiffel Tower and the
Statue of Liberty in New York harbor.
   But Mr. Shlenker's prospective lenders clearly didn't
share his enthusiasm. For more than two years, he tried
unsuccessfullly to obtain construction financing to build the
inside of the Pyramid -- a collegiate football hall of fame,
a Hard Rock cafe, a museum-like "Egyptian Experience," among
other things. Finally, local government officials lost their
patience.
   Despite these setbacks, the city and county plan to open
the sports arena this fall as scheduled and they say they
will find another private management company to develop other
amenities at The Pyramid. "The city and county are moving
right along with our part of the project," said county Mayor
Bill Morris.
   Mayor Morris said that the departure of Mr. Shlenker
wouldn't affect local government's ability to meet its
obligations on the bonds issued to finance the sports arena.
The city and county issued $55 million in bonds, split evenly
between them, to finance the basketball arena.
   While city officials say they intended all along to pay
the $3 million annual bond obligations out of the general
budget, that is also how much they expected to collect from
Mr. Schlenker's ventures.
   Now, many in Memphis believe that The Pyramid is almost
certain to be developed on a far more modest scale than
originally planned, and its potential to draw tourists may be
diminished. The Pyramid is "not something that will make
money the way a business makes money," said Prof. Ciscel. "We
will pay for it with our taxes for decades to come."
