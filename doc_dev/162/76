   Rock 'n' roll pioneer Dick Clark said
Friday he's donating hundreds of videotapes, films and other
memorabilia for a music museum in a 30-story pyramid being built
along the Mississippi River.
   ``I've got a great collection of stuff to share,'' Clark said.
   Clark's announcement was to have kicked off a night of parades,
music and fireworks to mark the start of construction of the $56
million pyramid, intended as the centerpiece of a $200 million
tourist theme park billed as a musical Disneyland.
   Then it rained, and the party was postponed 24 hours, leaving
thousands of would-be revelers wandering aimlessly past soggy beer
and souvenir stands, and the empty soundstages set up for
street-party bands.
   Promoters had promised for weeks that the celebration, called The
Big Dig, would be the biggest party Memphis had ever seen. But
Sidney Shlenker, the man who will run the pyramid, said wet
electronics made the affair too dangerous.
   Major events of The Big Dig included a fireworks display with a
ton of explosives and a laser-light show outlining the shape of the
321-foot pyramid.
   Police said they had expected up to 100,000 spectators for the
show but were unable to count the sparse crowd that showed up
because it was too scattered through downtown.
   ``We're going to have the whole show tomorrow night,'' Shlenker
said. ``It just got to a point tonight that the decision got taken
out of our hands. It rained so hard that we've got pools of water.
It's just too dangerous with the electrical equipment to risk
peoples' lives.''
   A late-night rock 'n' roll concert featuring comedian Dan Aykroyd
and his Blues Brothers Review was to go on as scheduled at an
amphitheater on the city's Mud Island tourist park near the pyramid
site.
   Clark, who helped usher in rock 'n' roll with his TV show
``American Bandstand,'' said the museum will be a hall of fame
linked to his annual American Music Awards. The museum will include
computerized displays with recordings and videotapes of the nation's
musical past.
   ``You'll be able to punch up a date and find out what musically
was happening, what world events were happening and what it meant to
your life,'' Clark said.
   The concrete and stainless steel pyramid is scheduled to open in
May 1991. It is called ``The Great American Pyramid.''
