<DESCRIPT>  EGYPT; HISTORY; RESEARCH  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  New evidence that Egypt's Great Sphinx may be twice as old as had been thought
has triggered a fierce argument between geologists who say that it must be
older and archaeologists who hold that that conclusion contradicts everything
they know about ancient Egypt.;   Geologists who presented their results at
the Geological Society of America convention here Tuesday found that
weathering patterns on the great monument were characteristic of a period far
older than had been believed.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Predecessors incapable?; But archaeologists and Egyptologists insist that
even if the Sphinx is older than they think, it could not be much older
because the people who lived in that region earlier could not have built it.; 
 Most Egyptologists believe that the Sphinx was built during the reign of the
Pharaoh Khafre, also known as Chephren, in approximately 2500 B.C. But
scientists who conducted a series of unprecedented studies at the Giza site
told colleagues their evidence shows that the Sphinx was there long before
Khafre came to power.;   The scientists say the evidence suggests that Khafre
simply refurbished the Sphinx, which may have been several thousand years old,
and incorporated it into his funereal complex.;   'Conservative' estimate;
Geologist Robert Schoch of Boston University told the meeting that his
research suggests the Sphinx actually dates back to between 5000 B.C. and 7000
B.C.;   "And I'm trying to be conservative," he said in an interview.;   But
archaeologist Carol Redmount of the University of California, Berkeley, who
specializes in Egyptian artifacts, said, "There's just no way that could be
true.";   The people of that region would not have had the technology, the
governing institutions or even the will to have built such a structure
thousands of years before Khafre's reign, she added.  </TEXT>
