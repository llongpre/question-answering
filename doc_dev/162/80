   French President Francois Mitterrand on Saturday
gave the summit leaders a personal guided tour of his pet project _
12th century ruins discovered beneath the Louvre.
   After their first full day of talks came to an end under the
Pyramid, the avant-garde glass structure that sits in the Louvre's
Napoleon Courtyard, Mitterand guided his guests from the underground
meeting site and into the excavated ruins under the museum.
   The 8-meter-high moat walls and guard towers are all that remains
of the castle fortress of French King Philippe-Auguste.
   Construction of the Louvre was begun in the 16th century on top
of the medieval fortress, of which only an 80-square-meter section
survives.
   The relic of medieval Paris is dear to Mitterrand's heart,
officials said, because it was only discovered during the
excavations to build the complex underneath the architecturally
controversial Pyramid.
   Both Mitterrand and his culture minister, Jack Lang, were roundly
criticized for plunking down the gleaming glass Pyramid in the
Napoleon Courtyard of the austere U-shaped Louvre, the world's
largest royal palace, and now one of the world's most famous museums.
   ``Mr. Mitterrand loves this place,'' said Evelyne Richard, a
spokeswoman for the French president. ``The construction of the
pyramid began in 1983, and the works were delayed because of this
find.''
   While Mitterrand led the way down a subterranean boardwalk in the
dry moat bed, France's director of museums, Michel Laclotte,
explained the history of the fortress to West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, President George Bush and Prime Ministers Margaret
Thatcher of Britain, Suosuke Uno of Japan, Ciriaco Mita of Italy and
Brian Mulroney of Canada.
   Mitterrand, his guests, and their interpreters then crowded into
a dimly lit antechamber where there is a display of artifacts
discovered during the excavation.
   A cacophony of languages echoed off the concrete walls as the
translators struggled to keep pace with Laclotte's explanations, and
the Western leaders asked questions.
   Among the finds were a golden fragment of the crown of the late
medieval King Charles VI.
   After the tour, Mitterrand led his guests into the Louvre for
champagne and hors d'oeuvres, as the setting sun streamed through
the windows of the palace on the Seine. The setting for the cocktail
session was a recently opened gallery of Greek and Roman statuary,
which the summit leaders toured as they chatted.
