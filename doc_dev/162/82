<LEADPARA>  MEXICO has become especially attractive as a late-winter and early-spring
destination this year, as the Persian Gulf war and the recession prompts
travelers to seek both safety and bargains in foreign destinations.;   
Wartime tensions, however, have led to increased security measures at borders
and airports.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Travelers' Advisory  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     To help travelers ease their entry into Mexico and their re-entry to the
United States, many travel agents are suggesting that Americans should carry
passports or birth certificates as identification.;    "American citizens
still aren't required to carry passports to Mexico, but we are encouraging
it," said Jose Luis Ayala of the Mexican Government Tourism Office in Los
Angeles, (213) 203-8191.;    "No one who has what we call the 'American look'
-- Anglo -- should expect delays or problems. We have eased restrictions for
holders of Mexican passports who are residents of the U.S.; they require only
passport and green card.;    "It is more difficult for people from the Middle
East Arabic countries who are entering from the U.S. or anywhere else.;   
"Each requires a visa and will be thoroughly investigated before a visa will
be issued by the Mexican consulate."; EGYPT;  (box) Not since World War II has
someone closed the Sphinx and pyramids in Egypt. A few days ago, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein closed them.;    "Obviously we're dealing with a
maniac in Hussein," said Hisham Sirry, manager of Egypt's tourism information
office in San Francisco. "We're afraid of terrorism from the Iraqis. They
could put a bomb anywhere.";    The massive pyramids are open to view insofar
as they are not cordoned off, but Sirry said that the interior tunnels, naves
and burial chambers have been sealed off and are under security guard.;    The
Sphinx and all of the country's other ancient monuments and museums are also
closed "indefinitely," Sirry said. The closure order was made Jan. 17 by the
country's ministry of tourism; the tourist industry accounts for a major
portion of Egypt's economy.;    However, he said, the State Department has
issued no advisories about Egypt, and "Egypt is stable and safe."; TRAVEL
WARNINGS;  (box) Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Tanzania are among
countries cited by the State Department in travel advisories warning of the
increased threat of possible terrorist actions against Americans as a result
of the Persian Gulf war.;    On Thailand, the department says a credible
threat to American and other foreign organizations was received in Bangkok.;  
 "The threat of terrorist acts in Southeast Asia is likely to continue for
some time," the advisory said.;    The advisory on Indonesia said an explosive
device was found Jan. 18 in the American ambassador's residence in Jakarta,
and other Americans have received threatening calls.;    The department's
report on Malaysia refers to the discovery Jan. 25 of a bomb in a ticket
office in Kuala Lumpur that was exploded by police.;    In Tanzania, the
department says, there has been a credible threat against American officials;
it has ordered the departure of non-essential personnel from the U.S. Embassy
in Dar es Salaam and advises American residents to leave the country. It urges
Americans to defer all non-essential travel to Tanzania.;    The inquiry
number, (202) 647-5225, for the State Department's citizen emergency center,
which lists current travel advisories, is now connected to 24 lines instead of
the usual 18 because of the volume of calls.  </TEXT>
