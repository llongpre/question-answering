   This quiet, bone-dry ravine
of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the Valley of the Kings
just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery.
   And with the mystery, its name.
   Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the Place of Beauty.
To the Arabs it was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and
guidebooks perpetuate the homage to entombed royal women: the
Valley of the Queens.
   ``It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by
all Egyptologists,'' said Christian LeBlanc, field director for a
continuing 17-year French-Egyptian project to record and study its
history.
   ``We should be calling it the Valley of the Royal Children. They
were here first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and
named by tradition rather than history.''
   Season after archaeological season, LeBlanc's team has scoured
the sloping, dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find
the origins of a sequence of burials that would last almost 2,000
years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as late as the Christian era
when pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses
painted on.
   LeBlanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of
ancient Egypt's 18th dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a
period of decline, pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died
like kings.
   That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the
19th dynasty, changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here.
   LeBlanc said it's unclear why he did or why the practice
continued. In addition to queens, royal children still were buried
here, and concubines who cared for them and pharaohs' mothers.
   Paintings in some of the tombs show Hathor, the goddess of women
and love, emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. LeBlanc
said perhaps this indicates that religion brought the ancients
here, because Hathor's realm also included the cemeteries on what
is called the West Bank across the Nile from present-day Luxor.
   The 18th dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began,
was a time when queens traditionally shared their pharaoh's tombs
in the Valley of the Kings. Many of ancient Egypt's greatest rulers
were buried there, along with the young pharoah Tutankhamun, whose
treasure-filled tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
   That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the
Kings. Hundreds of other royals and officials also were buried on
the West Bank. But to the world, the glory of the pharaohs meant
the Valley of the Kings _ not the Valley of the Queens, the Valley
of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles.
   For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an
afterthought, a place to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit
to the Valley of the Kings.
   When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found
in the limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known.
   ``We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were
working tomb-by-tomb,'' LeBlanc said. ``Today, we've uncovered all
the major tombs and have returned the valley to the way it would
have looked when burials began.
   ``For the first time, we can write its history.''
   As LeBlanc talked, he and Fathy Hassanein, director of the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization's National Documentation Center,
walked through scores of excavators digging toward the valley's
bedrock. The job at hand was almost done, another tomb uncovered
from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for most of its
existence.
   An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that
more can be opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now.
   The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers
of Ramses II's powerful queen Nefertari, is among those so
deteriorated that they remain off-limits. More than half its
paintings of the elaborately dressed and coiffured queen have been
destroyed by natural forces.
   LeBlanc said one source for the valley's history has been
tidbits left by workers who built and decorated the tombs. For
generations they lived in a village inside the valley. Their
records, on papyrus, provided the team not only with answers but
with mysteries.
   Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis
Nefret, one of Ramses II's many wives, and a queen named
Duat-Iny-Pet.
   LeBlanc said they might have been same person, but ``where are
they?''
   He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of
the queens' mummies.
   ``This is strange,'' he said. ``Did those who came afterwards
destroy them?'' He added that it could mean another royal cache
exists, perhaps mummies of queens and children.
   Typical of the tales LeBlanc has faced in rewriting a new
history for the valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the
tomb of 9-year-old prince Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of Ramses III.
   Local guides tell fascinated visitors that Ramses' queen became
so distraught over the death of their son that she miscarried and
the mummies of both Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed.
   The story is nonsense, Leblanc said.
   Early this century, the Italian excavator Ernesto Schiaparelli
found the fetus in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens.
It was Schiaparelli, not ancient priests, who placed it inside the
prince's empty sarcophagus.
   Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction
that it has its own tiny case.
