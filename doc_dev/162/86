   Nature lovers defending the country's largest
colony of rare egrets persuaded officials to halt an assault on
nesting trees to keep bird droppings from coating parked cars.
   From the birds' point of view, the victory came in the nick of
time: 11 of the huge trees had been ruined, scores of the majestic
birds have died and hundreds of others fled to safer environs.
   For more than a century, thousands of egrets have made their
homes in 99 tall eucalyptuses beside Cairo Zoo and along Sharia
Giza, or Giza Street, a main boulevard in this Cairo suburb.
   Protected by law as an endangered species, the snow-white birds
became a familiar sight. They flew at dawn to distant fields down
the Nile, where they helped farmers control insects, then returned
to their nests as the sun sank over the pyramids in the distance.
   Just as familiar in recent decades have been the cars parked
along Giza Street, usually splattered with bird droppings.
   This summer, owners of luxury apartments overlooking the zoo
complained to authorities about the droppings and demanded action.
   At midnight Oct. 9, the government sent dozens of men with
bulldozers and chain saws. They spent the rest of the night
obliterating the foliage of the first three trees.
   Inadvertantly, they also destroyed parts of the zoo's antique
iron wall and flattened an empty bus stop.
   ``They made preparations as if it was a war,'' said Mohamed
Hussein Amer, the zoo official in charge of birds and animals and
one of several activists who stopped the anti-egret campaign.
   It took two days for telegrams and phone calls to senior
officials and police to halt the massacre. By then, 11 eucalyptus
evergreens had lost all their branches, as many as 200 egrets were
dead, and about 2,000 others fled into the zoo seeking shelter.
   ``It's not just the issue of 11 butchered trees. It's harmful to
Egypt's reputation,'' Amer said.
   ``It was awful _ children running after the birds, the stray
cats eating the small, helpless chicks in their nests. It was
terrible,'' he said.
   Amer estimated 5,000 pairs of egrets live on the 1\-mile stretch
of Giza Street. But Mindy Bahaa el-Din, a zoo employee from
Indianapolis, said a 1987 survey counted 1,604 pairs.
   Mrs. Bahaa el-Din, associated with the British International
Council for Bird Preservation, said because the egrets' breeding
period was unfinished, most of the chicks were too small to fly to
safety.
   ``The first day I saw the damage, I thought a tornado or
hurricane had hit. At least 100 baby egrets were killed,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bahaa el-Din said Giza's governor, Omar Abdel-Akher,
insisted that the governorate had broken no law.
   ``We haven't killed any birds,'' she said Abdel-Akher told her.
``The law bans hunting birds, and we didn't do that.''
   On Tuesday, the newspaper Al-Ahram reported that Environment
Minister Atef Ebeid had ordered Abdel-Akher to stop the
``cleaning-up campaign.''
   Egrets, tall and thin, boast long white plumes, spindly legs and
elongated, slender bills. They have lived in Egypt for thousands of
years, depicted on walls of ancient tombs.
   Although hundreds of thousands once filled Egyptian fields, they
came close to extinction at the turn of the century as plume
hunters shot them down to obtain feathers for hats. A 1912 law
declared egrets a protected species and their colonies rejuvenated,
but farmers using pesticides killed many of them.
   The 99 eucalyptus trees were planted in 1954 alongside trees
where the free-ranging cattle egrets first nested.
   ``The governorate's report says that the tree branches were
being removed because they were old, dying and diseased,'' said
Amer. ``These eucalyptus trees live for up to 450 years, and they
are certainly not diseased.''
   Another governorate administration about 10 years ago tried to
trim the eucalyptus branches to get rid of the egrets, but a public
uproar ended it.
   Despite the temporary pro-bird victory, Mrs. Bahaa el-Din said
she expects the governorate to insist on moving the colony, but in
a more scientific way, so as not to harm the birds, and without
dismembering the trees.
   A Cairo University professor, who passes the zoo every day,
waxed lyrical when asked about the assault on the trees and the
birds:
   ``One day it was like a beautiful woman whose hair was flowing
in the breeze. Yesterday, it was like somebody had shaved her
head.''
