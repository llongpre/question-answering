   The red berets are back.
   They stand at street corners and patrol outside the hotels and
at the Pyramids, sidearms wrapped in white holsters - a reminder
that the Persian Gulf crisis could erupt in terror in Cairo at any
time.
   Egypt, often accused of talking a lot but doing little about its
problems, seems to be taking security seriously since the country's
parliament speaker was assassinated on a downtown street Oct. 12.
   The red berets are military police.
   They were last seen on the streets of this city of 12 million in
February 1986, after the army suppressed riots by police draftees
angered by rumors that their tours of duty had been lengthened.
   Special police security units are also out in force, wearing
black uniforms and combat helmets. Traffic policemen are wearing
sidearms again. Purses are searched at the entrances to floating
restaurants on the Nile.
   Many Egyptians began to worry about terrorist attacks early in
August, when President Hosni Mubarak committed troops to the
Persian Gulf to check Iraq, which had just invaded Kuwait.
   But there were few visible signs that the threat of attack -
from Iraqi, Palestinian or Islamic fundamentalist agents - was
being taken seriously.
   More worrisome was the economy.
   Egypt faced losses estimated at $4.5 billion in the form of a
ruined tourism industry, reduced Suez Canal revenues and lost
remittances from an estimated 500,000 Egyptians who had to return
home from the gulf.
   The financial picture has brightened somewhat. Egypt's U.S. and
Arab allies are moving to write off $14 billion in debts, aid worth
hundreds of millions of dollars is pouring in, and there are good
prospects for agreement with the International Monetary Fund to
reschedule the remaining foreign debt.
   But security suddenly took the forefront on Oct. 1, when gunmen
ambushed Rifaat el-Mahgoub, killing the speaker, his driver and
five security men.
   So far at least 10 suspects have been arrested on suspicion of
involvement in el-Mahgoub's murder. Two other suspects were shot to
death in a street gunbattle on Saturday.
   Police have ordered security checks at hotels in the downtown
area, near where el-Mahgoub was assassinated. Security trucks now
guard entrances and exits at sporting clubs frequented by diplomats
and foreigners. Police details have been reinforced at Cairo
American College, an international school in Maadi, at the Sphinx
and Giza Pyramids.
   But traditions of lax security die hard.
   The opposition newspaper El-Wafd reported last week that its
reporter and a photographer talked their way through Cairo
International Airport checkpoints and walked up the gangway, and
into the cockpit of an empty airliner.
   Government newspapers the next day reported a new program of
television monitors and other security steps.
