   Ever since Egypt's King Zoser built the Step Pyramid some 4,600
years ago, stone has been a sign of elegance and strength in the
field of building and furnishings.
   Egyptologists say Zoser's pyramid, the world's first major
building in stone, was considered a staircase to heaven. Some
modern designers say the use of stone simulations brings an touch
of richness and grace to the modern home.
   ``This is the age of faux finishes _ the look of marble, stone,
even wood achieved through creative techniques _ on everything from
walls and floors to fabrics and accessories,'' says designer Janet
Carter.
   ``The design emphasis for the 1990s is on texture and creating
an illusion of depth. The popularity of stone simulations has led
to numerous fabric and furnishing accessories that add distinction
and polish.''
   Carter adds that with today's new faux finishes, floors, walls
and furnishings can have the look and durability of stone without
the hassles.
   ``Simple painting techniques, for those even a little handy with
a paint brush, allow you to create the elegance of stone for one or
all walls in a room,'' explains Carter, a member of the Color
Marketing Group and American Society of Interior Designers.
   Real stone, from solid marble to delicate slate, she says, is
hard to care for, expensive to replace and often too heavy for
residential walls and floors.
   ``There is a strong trend toward contemporary designs in sheet
vinyl floors. Stripes, chevrons and banding combined with the look
of stone capture a contemporary elegance for any environment,''
says Gerald Ewan, director of styling for Mannington Resilient
Floors.
   Some designers note that while the look of stone may be classic,
the homeowner should remember not to get carried away with a trend.
   Stone looks can either make a strong statement on walls, floors
and furnishings, or create a subtle effect with accessories, linens
and pillows.
   ``Stone maintains its elegance when strategically placed to
complement its surroundings,'' says one industry observer.
