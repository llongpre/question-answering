   Far fewer generations will see the world's
ancient monuments than have seen them already. Fewer still will see
them if nations don't decide soon which to save and which to let
die.
   Changing temperatures and humidities, indoor and outdoor air
pollution, artificial light, traffic, bacteria and other ills are
causing monuments and antiquities everywhere to fall apart.
   ``The decisions are going to be difficult, but if governments
and officials don't act, there'll be very little left,'' said Luis
Monreal, an international conservation specialist.
   ``The next decade is crucial. We have the technology. Where's
the courage?''
   What concerns Monreal is a tendency of governments to ignore the
warnings of archaeologists and conservationists, who are spokesmen
for the monuments and not for powerful political lobbies. The
problem becomes especially acute in countries rich in artifacts but
poor in finances, when antiquities officials try to take stands to
save artifacts only to be overruled by politicians more interested
in tourist dollars than in the monuments' survival.
   ``But we must decide which monuments can and should be saved,''
Monreal said. ``Whatever we do, even if it's the right thing, man
is going to lose 60 to 80 percent of his cultural heritage in the
centuries ahead.''
   Monreal heads the Getty Conservation Institute of Marina del
Rey, Calif., the only private institution that researches ways to
carry out cultural conservation and puts up the money to do it.
   Bits and pieces of the past, from miniscule to gargantuan, from
the Americas to China, are specimens for Getty's experts: Tombs.
Mummies. Paintings. Adobe. Old photographs. Oriental lacquerware.
Tapestries. Primitive rock drawings. English silver.
   How to save them?
   Getty money and expertise are cooperating with local officials
in four major projects:
   _Restoration and conservation of decaying wall paintings in the
3,500-year-old tomb of Queen Nefertari, favorite wife of Pharaoh
Ramses II, across the Nile River from Luxor in southern Egypt.
   _A pilot project to conserve Roman-era floor mosaics at Paplos
on Cyprus in the Mediterranean.
   _Preservation of two major Buddhist sites in China: rock temples
dating as early as A.D. 366 in the Mogao grottoes at the edge of
the Gobi Desert and the Yungang grottoes, 200 miles west of Beijing.
   _A preservation showcase for organic materials, including 27
royal mummies in Cairo's Egyptian Museum and the Dead Sea Scrolls
in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
   Monreal, who recently was in Cairo to discuss Egypt's crumbling
past with officials, said technology must be matched with specific
needs.
   ``It's hard, but officials are going to have to decide which
monuments live and which die.''
   Monreal cites two examples: Spain's medieval castles and the
4,500-year-old Sphinx near Cairo.
   Spain, which is Monreal's home country, wants to preserve its
heritage but has so many troubled monuments it can't save them all.
   ``There are 2,000 medieval castles built during 700 years of
warfare,'' Monreal said. ``Even if the entire (Spanish) defense
budget were turned over to save the castles, it wouldn't be
enough.''
   The problem is different with the Sphinx, a stone lion with a
pharaoh's face unique for its size. Monreal said there's no doubt
it should be saved.
   ``But the Sphinx is terminal. It's dying. What do you do for any
terminal patient? You put him in intensive care, on a life support
system.''
   He suggests covering the monument while scientists debate what
to do, but Egyptian officials are uneasy about isolating one of the
country's top tourist attractions.
   ``You can cover it and still allow people to see it as
scientists decide what's the matter. Up to three years of study lie
ahead. But once they know, officials will have to make a decision.
   ``And that decision might not be popular.''
   Monreal said getting the money for such work is the ``easiest
part if it's a good project. Saving the Sphinx would be a gold mine
for public relations. Companies would fall all over themselves to
save the Sphinx.''
   But too often, he added, ``wasting money, a lot of money''
results from wrong-headed priorities.
   ``Some monuments will be saved that really don't matter, and
some that should be saved, won't be,'' he said. ``What are you
going to choose: To save 30 percent of your monuments for 100 years
or 10 percent for 1,000?
   ``It's superficial to spread the batter too thin. ... In some
cases projects are taken on by corporations not because the relic
is worthy of being saved but because it's the pet of the chairman
of the board.
   ``We see this in Italy, and in the United States the situation
is terrible.''
   On the other hand is Mexico, a country with many fragile
monuments, which Monreal said is doing the best job of saving the
artifacts that should be saved despite its economic problems.
   ``Years ago those who wanted to preserve the past were given the
political power to make decisions,'' he said. ``Today Mexico's past
is doing well.''
   Monreal, 46, has spent his adult life in museums, seeking ways
to preserve treasures. Co-workers call his life with monuments a
passion, and he admits it's a utopian dream.
   ``I'm perishable; they're perishable. But I'm trying to keep
what's standing, standing,'' he said.
   ``Even in 1,000 years some monuments will be standing because
they were so well-built, but when it's finished, it's finished. You
can't change history, but maybe you can prolong a monument's life.''
