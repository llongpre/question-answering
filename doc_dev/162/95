   Archaeological exploration in Iraq has picked
up since the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, yielding rich finds
from the era 2,000 years ago when the powerful Assyrian empire
dominated the Middle East.
   The upsurge comes as President Saddam Hussein's government seeks
to bolster Iraq's self-image through excavation and rebuilding at
sites like Babylon that symbolize the nation's historical greatness.
   ``By appealing to history, Saddam encourages Iraqis to view
themselves as the heirs of a great civilization that flowered in
ancient Iraq while the surrounding world was lingering in
prehistory,'' a Western diplomat said.
   Iraq includes much of the ``fertile crescent'' of ancient
Mesopotamia where early rulers developed efficient armies and
sophisticated city administrations that rivalled the Pharaohs' Egypt.
   Ruined temples and palaces adorned with colossal stone
sculptures, archives of inscribed clay tablets, delicate goldwork
and ivory carvings illustrate the importance of early Iraqi
civilization.
   To help build morale during the recent eight-year war with
Persian Iran, the Iraqi government recalled Assyrian and Babylonian
victories in the first millennium B.C. against the ancient Persians,
portrayed as unscrupulous aggressors.
   Although the war was halted last August by a United
Nations-mediated cease-fire, history is still being promoted,
underscoring Saddam's drive to boost Iraq's role in the Arab world.
   In addition to the Iraqi teams, archaeologists from the United
States, Britain, Poland, West Germany, the Netherlands and Japan
were digging around the country earlier this year. Most will resume
work in the fall.
   Saddam also agreed in recent talks with American businessmen in
Baghdad, Iraq's capital, that a selection of ancient Iraqi treasures
would tour the United States.
   ``It's clear there's more than scholarship involved in all this
promotion of archaeology ... but the recent finds have been
spectacular,'' said a Western archaeologist, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   New excavations at three sites in the Assyrian heartland of
northern Iraq have unearthed a gold-filled royal tomb dating from
the 8th century B.C., as well as imposing sculpture and
architectural remains.
   At Nimrud, the Assyrian military capital 250 miles north of
Baghdad, Iraqi archaeologists found a stone chamber where two women
were buried along with more than 55 pounds of gold jewelry.
   Muzahem Mahmoud, the excavation director, said it was ``the
richest Assyrian burial known.''
   An inscription on stone in the tomb in wedge-shaped cuneiform
writing identified the women as Yabaya and Taliya, possibly the
daughter and grand-daughter of King Sargon who ruled an empire that
stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean.
   The inscription also laid a curse on anyone who opened the burial
chamber: ``If anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave, I
pray to the gods of the nether world that his soul should roam in
the scorching sun after death. ... Let the ghost of insomnia take
hold of him for ever and ever.''
   The gold jewelry included diadems, necklaces, belts, bracelets
and anklets, and 50 pairs of earrings, as well as a bronze mirror
with an enamel handle encrusted in precious stones.
   At Ninevah, the Assyrians' administrative capital, another Iraqi
team unearthed a stone door carved with four lions that was part of
the city's fortifications in its last days.
   They also found arrowheads and skeletons of Assyrian warriors who
may have died during a siege by the Babylonians and Medes. Ninevah
fell in 612 B.C. after holding out for two months and was destroyed.
   Outside the ruins, the archaeologists found remnants of an
irrigation system built by King Sennacherib a century earlier to
increase vegetation around the city, as well as a stone terrace
where he constructed what the tablets call ``a palace without
rival.''
   Farther north near the border with Syria, British archaeologists
tentatively identified a 100-foot high mound as the remains of
ancient Tillule, another important military and religious center.
   The team found the base of a ziggurat, a temple shaped like a
stepped pyramid, that may have belonged to a shrine for the Assyrian
weather god, Adad.
   They also located sections of two roads believed to be part of
highways linking Ninevah with Syria and Turkey.
   ``Everything here tells us that this is a major settlement,''
said excavation director Warwick Ball of the British Museum. ``It's
only a matter of time before we find the clues to tell us that Tel
Al-Hawa is the modern name of Tillule.''
   He said the Assyrians used Tillule as a center for massing troops
before launching campaigns against Syria, Palestine and Egypt.
   At Babylon, whose kings succeeded the Assyrians as rulers of
Mesopotamia, a major project is underway to excavate and restore the
whole nine-square-mile area of the ancient city.
   The multimillion-dollar restoration will include the palace of
King Nebuchadnezzar, the 6th century B.C. king who built the
legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of
the World.
   The city quickly grew into Mesopotamia's largest population
center with around 1 million residents. But Babylonian supremacy
lasted less than a century before the city was overrun by King Cyrus
of Persia in 539 B.C.
