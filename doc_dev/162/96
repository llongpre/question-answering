   President Francois Mitterrand on Friday toured the
tall glass pyramid capping the new entrance to the Louvre museum,
finally finished after six years of controversy and delay.
   The 72-foot-high pyramid is set between the museum's two main
wings and tops three underground levels, which are still under
construction. The lower levels will house a main foyer, boutiques,
information desks, snack bars, storage rooms, restoration studios
and other services.
   The new $17.5 million complex won't be open to the public until
the end of the year.
   Mitterrand, accompanied by Culture Minister Francois Leotard and
other government officials, awarded the Legion of Honor medal to
I.M. Pei, the Chinese-American architect who designed the pyramid.
   ``Here is a man who is not only in love with the Louvre, but
also with French history,'' Mitterrand said following the visit.
``I knew he would do nothing to take away from the beauty and the
history of the site.''
   Mitterrand said he had seen examples of Pei's work in Washington
and Boston, and was taken with his pure, geometric forms.
   ``I guess you could say I like pure and simple shapes better
than any others,'' he said.
   Starting next year, the pyramid will be the Louvre's only
above-ground entrance, though there will be direct access from
nearby subway stations and underground parking lots.
   The three underground levels form a hub and will be connected to
the Louvre's two miles of painting and sculpture galleries by
corridors resembling the spokes of a giant wheel.
   The pyramid is but a small portion of a $2.6 billion overall
moderization.
   It was met with considerable resistance from public groups, art
historians and political leaders after it was unveiled early in
Mitterrand's presidential term, but he remained committed to it.
   Renovations of the museum have been delayed by Finance Minister
Edouard Balladur's refusal to vacate the sumptuous offices in the
Louvre's northern wing, his ministry's preserve for decades. The
Finance Ministry is supposed to move by the end of the year to new
quarters in eastern Paris.
