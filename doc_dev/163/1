   An 11-year-old Californian, the youngest pilot to
fly the Atlantic, stepped from the cockpit Thursday with a huge
grin on his freckled face. He was greeted by champagne toasts and a
proud but worried mother.
   ``We're finally here. We made it,'' said Christopher Lee
Marshall, weary but beaming, as he stood on the wing of his
single-engine Mooney 252 aircraft at Le Bourget, the same airfield
where Charles Lindbergh completed the first solo transatlantic
flight in 1927.
   ``Mommy missed you so much. Give me a kiss,'' said his mother,
Gail Marshall of Oceana, Calif., who waved an American flag and
handed Christopher a new stuffed bear.
   His old stuffed bear Charles Lindbeargh, cuddly and blue with
aviator's helmet and goggles, accompanied him on the long flight.
   ``Charles Lindbergh was one of my heroes,'' the young aviator
told reporters. ``So we decided on this trip, then next year
hopefully around the world.''
   He still wore his bright blue flight suit, with a baseball cap
reading ``Chris Marshall Tour'' covering his straw-colored hair, as
he sipped cola at a champagne and soft-drink reception inside an
airport hangar.
   Unlike Lindbergh, Christopher made several stops between New
York and Paris _ in Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland _ and
had company and emergency help from retired Navy pilot Randy
Cunningham, 46. Their trip started in San Diego on July 7.
   ``I didn't want to take an 11-year-old boy and make him fly for
20 hours straight,'' Cunningham said. ``I had a hard enough time
having him fly eight hours a day and keeping him awake. You know an
11-year-old boy wants to go to sleep when he gets tired.''
   Christopher's mother and friends who helped plan the trip said
they did not know who the previous youngest pilot to fly the
Atlantic might have been, but they were confident no one younger
had done it.
   Cunningham said the youngster, who will enter fifth grade this
fall, is ``a very talented pilot. He flies better than some of the
adults I've flown with.''
   He first went into a cockpit when he was 4 years old _ with his
father, an airline pilot _ and began flying with an instructor when
he was 7.
   Last year he became the youngest pilot to fly across the United
States, but the record already has been broken. Christopher said he
was glad even younger kids have followed his example.
   ``I'm an ambassador to the youth of America, and I'm showing all
kids across America that they can go out and accomplish their
dreams,'' he said.
   The scariest moment of the flight came early Wednesday, when the
plane's oil pressure fell and its engine began overheating in bad
weather between Greenland and Reykjavik, Iceland.
   Cunningham took the controls for the return to the southeast
coast of Greenland and had to pick his way through mountains to a
small airfield at Kulusuk, where clouds were just 100 feet off the
ground.
   ``Only one of a million pilots could have made that landing and
he did,'' Christopher said. ``We came so close to dying.''
   ``I didn't think we'd make it through. We had to fly at 50 feet
off the ground, because there were mountains and it was
quarter-mile visibility and all the ocean was iced up. It was
neat.''
   The former Navy pilot said Christopher was not exaggerating the
danger they had faced.
   ``I went back in the clouds and came back down and then went
back around the mountains for about 20 minutes, trying to find the
runway desperately,'' he said. ``I didn't think I was going to
live.''
   Because Cunningham only flew the plane while it was
backtracking, he and Christopher both consider the youngster to
have been the pilot for a complete transatlantic crossing.
   Mrs. Marshall said she worried throughout the voyage, while
waiting at a Paris hotel room, but didn't realize until later how
frightening the experience could be for her son.
   ``If I knew, I don't think I would have let him go,'' she said.
   After engine repairs in Greenland, Christopher took the controls
again for the flight to Reykjavik, then on to Glasgow, Scotland,
where they stayed Wednesday night before the final leg to Paris.
