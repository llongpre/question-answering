   A federal appeals court Tuesday rejected
efforts by the wife of Bruno Richard Hauptmann to clear his name in
the 1932 kidnapping-murder of the son of aviator Charles Lindbergh
   In a one-sentence statement, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here affirmed a September 1987 ruling by U.S. District
Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. in Trenton.
   Robert R. Bryan, the attorney of Anna Hauptmann, vowed to take
his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We are undaunted,'' he said in a telephone interview from his
San Francisco office. ``Our goal remains the same: to clear her
husband's name during her life.''
   Mrs. Hauptmann, 89, lives in Yeadon, Pa.
   Her husband was convicted in the March 1, 1932, kidnapping and
murder of the 20-month-old son of Lindbergh and his wife, Anne
Spencer Morrow Lindbergh, from their East Amwell Township, N.J.,
estate.
   Hauptmann was convicted following a sensational trial in
Flemington, N.J. that earned international attention, and was
executed April 3, 1936, at Trenton State Prison.
   Mrs. Hauptmann charged in a federal lawsuit that the case
against her husband should be reopened. The legal action was based
on new evidence Bryan said he uncovered, including more than 22,000
pages of documents and lost trial evidence found three years ago in
the garage of the late Harold G. Hoffman, New Jersey's governor at
the time of the trial and execution.
   The lawsuit claimed that the trial was riddled with
mispresentations and fraud, evidence was suppressed, witnesses were
coerced or lied on the state and testimony was changed.
