   Author A. Scott Berg will write a biography of
Charles A. Lindbergh, authorized by the pioneering aviator's widow,
the Putnam Berkley Group announced Thursday.
   ``Impressed by the thoroughness, objectivity and compassion of
his previous works, Anne Morrow Lindbergh has granted A. Scott Berg
complete access to the heretofore restricted Charles A. Lindbergh
collections at Yale University and the Missouri Historical
Society,'' said Mrs. Lindbergh's attorney, James W. Lloyd.
   The 83-year-old widow of the man who first flew solo from the
United States to France also granted Berg access to her personal
papers.
   The permission is valid until the year 2000. Access to the
Lindbergh collections by other researchers will be restricted while
Berg completes his biography, the publisher said.
   ``Charles Lindbergh has been idolized and demonized ... and the
truth remains to be revealed,'' said Berg. ``In the end, I feel a
great life story will emerge _ one whose values are not only timely
but also timeless.''
   G.P. Putnam's Sons will publish the Lindbergh book in hardcover
in the fall of 1997. A paperback edition will be issued by Berkley
Books the following year.
   Berg graduated from Princeton University in 1971 and spent the
next seven years expanding his senior thesis on Maxwell Perkins
into the biography, ``Max Perkins: Editor of Genius,'' which won
the American Book Award.
   His most recent book was the bestseller ``Goldwyn: A
Biography,'' published last year.
