   The Navy's oldest civilian engineer retired
Friday, after a career that spanned two world wars and included a
stint helping Charles Lindbergh design the pontooned planes he flew
to China.
   Rudy Ries, 89, was honored during ceremonies at the Naval
Training Systems Center for his achievement of being the oldest
full-time civilian employee in the Navy.
   ``You've been an inspiration to us all,'' said Capt. C.D. Rowley,
commanding officer of the Naval Training Systems Center, as he
presented Ries with a number of certificates, letters of
commendation and a plaque. ``We are all proud you were one of us.''
   In a letter read to Ries, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III
thanked him for his 26 years of dedicated service.
   When the German-born Ries joined the German Air Force in 1916,
World War I had ended before he could become a fighter pilot. In
1928, he saw the onset of Naziism in his country and came to America
as a mechanical engineer.
   Ries began his latest career in 1963 and might have continued in
his job, he said in an interview, if his wife, Julia, hadn't died
last year and if the nature of his engineering work hadn't changed.
   He's a hands-on engineer and much of today's engineering is just
paperwork, Ries said. In effect, he said, they've taken away his
drafting board.
   ``I enjoy engineering. I think engineering is designing things,
creating things,'' he said. ``But one thing we've turned to now is
just writing specifications ... for somebody else to build
something. I don't like this.''
   He described the reams of specifications turned out by today's
engineers as ``letters to Santa Claus.''
   In earlier years, Ries worked with Lindbergh and Adm. Richard
Byrd in designing pontoons for the planes they flew to China and the
South Pole.
   He worked first for Fairchild Aviation and then Merganthaler
Linotype Co. before joining EDO Aircraft on Long Island in 1930. He
became an American citizen in that year.
   It was at EDO that he worked with Lindbergh and Byrd.
   ``Lindbergh and his wife were flying to China and he wanted
special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane, with a motor in
between, in case he landed in the water,'' Ries said.
   The Lindbergh's returned to EDO aircraft after their flight to
China and had lunch with Ries and other company officials. ``I
loaned him my pocketknife to cut his onions with, and I've still got
that knife,'' Ries said.
   He helped design one of the world's first high-altitude metal
planes, was a consultant in the Ukraine to Soviet builders of the
American-designed PBY flying boat and worked for the Fokker Aircraft
Co. in the Netherlands before the Germans invaded Poland,
precipitating World War II.
   In recent years, he has designed training simulators to explode
Tomahwak and Harm missiles when they fail to detonate in combat and
maneuvers. He is also responsible for the design of a training aid
for the military's newest torpedo, the Mark 50.
   He said he intends to keep active when he returns to his native
Germany to live with his son and family in Bonn. His son, Eric Ries,
is a civil engineer with the State Department there.
