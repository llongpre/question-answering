   The Navy's oldest civilian employee, an
89-year-old engineer, has retired and is going back to Germany,
where he launched a career in aviation that spanned six decades.
   Rudy Ries came to this country in 1928 and worked for 35 years
for companies that pioneered in aviation: Fairchild, Convair,
Martin, EDO Aircraft and for Fokker in the Netherlands. He helped
design pontoons for the planes flown by Charles Lindbergh to China
and by Adm. Richard Byrd to the South Pole.
   ``I've enjoyed my work, all of it,'' he said sadly at a
retirement ceremony at the Naval Training Systems Center on Friday.
``I will miss it.''
   He said he would fly to Bonn, West Germany, this weekend to live
with his son, a civil engineer posted with the U.S. State Department
there.
   The diminutive, soft-spoken Ries worked ``only'' 26 years for the
Navy Department, starting in 1963.
   Born in Frankfurt, he joined the German air force during World
War I, but he hadn't completed pilot training when it ended. In
1928, he saw the onset of Nazism in his country and came to America.
   He became a citizen in 1930, the year he joined EDO on New York's
Long Island.
   ``Lindbergh and his wife were flying to China and he wanted
special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane, with a motor in
between, in case he landed in the water,'' Ries said.
   The Lindberghs returned to EDO after their flight to China and
had lunch with Ries and other company officials.
   ``I loaned him my pocket knife to cut his onions with, and I've
still got that knife,'' Ries said.
   Another highlight of his two stints at EDO was the design of an
all-metal airplane designed to operate at 30,000 feet, a two-seater
named the Model-R in his honor. The Depression caused the company to
cut back work on it and the Model-R was never flown.
   In 1936, Ries went to work for Consolidated Aircraft in
California, which later became Convair.
   From there, he and 20 other engineers and assistants were sent to
the Soviet Union to help in setting up an assembly plant. After
spending more than a year in the Ukraine, he got a job at Fokker
Aircraft Co. in Amsterdam. But Ries' European stay was cut short
with the approach of World War II, and he returned to this country.
   A hands-on mechanical engineer, he admitted frustration with his
profession's increasing reliance on paperwork, which he called
``letters to Santa Claus.''
   ``I enjoy engineering. I think engineering is designing things,
creating things,'' he said. ``But one thing we've turned to now is
just writing specifications ... for somebody else to build
something. I don't like this.''
   In recent years, he has designed training simulators for the
controllers who explode Tomahawk and Harm missiles when they fail to
detonate or go off course. He also is responsible for the design of
a training aid for the military's newest torpedo, the Mark 50, which
can be dropped from an airplane or fired from land or ships at sea.
