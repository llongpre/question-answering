<HEAD>Young Pilot Resumes Flight To Paris After Stop For Plane Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>

   An 11-year-old pilot left Montreal Monday on the
next part of his San Diego to Paris journey after his plane was
grounded for a day by mechanical trouble.
   Christopher Lee Marshall left Dorval airport at 2:42 p.m. EDT
headed for Wabush, Labrador, in a single-engine Mooney 252
two-seater, said Doug McGurk, a Transport Canada spokesman.
   The boy from Oceano, Calif., has said the trip will make him the
world's youngest transatlantic pilot and he wants to make the trip
to emulate Charles Lindberg's 1927 flight to Paris. One of his
other goals is to become the youngest pilot to fly around the world.
   The fifth-grade student and son of a commercial pilot is
accompanied by Randy Cunningham, 40, a retired pilot who served in
the Vietnam war. Cunningham limits the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a stretch.
   They are scheduled to fly to Greenland and Iceland before
arriving in Paris. The trip began in San Diego last Thursday.
   They had been scheduled to leave Montreal Sunday but were unable
to take off because a voltage regulator aboard the plane had to be
repaired.
   McGurk said the flight from Montreal to Wabush, at 21,000 feet,
would take nearly four hours.
   Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York
before completing his 33{-hour non-stop solo flight across the
Atlantic Ocean to Paris.
   Christopher first took the controls of a plane at age four and
began flying with an instructor three years later.
   Last year he became the youngest pilot to cross the United
States. Tony Aliengena, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., broke the record in April by making a
California-to-Massachusetts round trip.
