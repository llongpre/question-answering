   Imagine a brash astronaut thumbing his nose
at the space agency and taking an old Mercury spacecraft all the
way to the moon, then claiming it was a mistake, and you get a
glimmer of Douglas ``Wrong Way'' Corrigan's feat 50 years ago.
   ``My compass froze. I guess I flew the wrong way,'' Corrigan
claimed on July 18, 1938, after making a forbidden New
York-to-Dublin flight in a used Curtiss-Robin monoplane on which
he'd spent $900. Plus $90 for gas and oil.
   He has steadfastly maintained he thought he was returning to his
home base of Long Beach, Calif., after federal aviation authorities
denied him permission to fly to Ireland.
   But Corrigan, now 81 and living in Santa Ana, Calif., hinted in
a telephone interview last week that his wrong-way explanation may
change after he flies again to Dublin on Sunday, this time as an
honored guest for three days of ceremonies commemorating his flight.
   ``Maybe this time over in Dublin, I'll tell them another story.
We'll see,'' he said Thursday.
   Corrigan's ``wrong-way'' explanation sounded like pure blarney
at the time _he was made a lifetime member of the Liars Club _ but
America and Ireland loved it.
   He was the overnight guest of the U.S. ambassadors in Dublin and
London. After he returned to New York by ship, with his plane in a
crate, he was given a ticker-tape parade. There was even a meeting
with President Franklin Roosevelt.
   A movie was turned out by RKO Studios,``The Flying Irishman,''
starring Corrigan as himself, and there were magazine articles and
an autobiography, ``That's My Story.'' He estimated he grossed
$85,000 from tours and speeches.
   As punishment for his journey, the Bureau of Air Commerce,
forerunner of the Federal Aviation Administration, suspended
Corrigan from flying for five days. Those five days were served
while he was still aboard ship on the way home.
   Whatever the true story, Corrigan had joined the ranks of his
hero, Charles Lindbergh, and Wiley Post by making a solo, nonstop,
single-engine crossing of the Atlantic.
   He also dispelled the notion that air feats were only for
millionaires and well-financed aviators.
   When Corrigan was 20, he was a woodworker at Ryan Aircraft in
San Diego and helped build Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis for the
1927 New York-to-Paris solo trans-Atlantic flight.
   Corrigan got his pilot's license the next year. He bought a
leather flight jacket just like Lindy's, scraped his money together
and studied navigation.
   He bought his monoplane for $310 in 1931, and spent an
additional $590 modifying it into a long-distance machine. Before
the flight to Ireland, he flew from Long Beach to New York nonstop
in 27 hours on July 7-8.
   Then the Bureau of Air Commerce refused to grant permission for
a trans-Atlantic flight, on grounds his plane, loaded with 330
gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil, was 55 percent too
heavy for a safe flight.
   Corrigan took off from New York's Floyd Bennett Field on July
17, saying he was headed for Long Beach. He landed at Dublin 28
hours and 13 minutes later, 3,150 miles from New York.
   ``There had been a haze near the ground and when I was 500 feet
high, there was fog below the plane,'' Corrigan once said of his
flight. ``When I started to turn west I noticed the top compass was
not working right, due to the liquid having leaked out. ... There
was another compass down on the floor that I had set to fly a
westerly course, so now I turned the plane until the parallel lines
matched, and flew over the fog.''
   The wrong way.
   He had no radio and his $1 wristwatch stopped. ``The only modern
instrument I had was a turn-and-bank indicator,'' said Corrigan,
who subsisted on fig and chocolate bars and some water during his
flight.
   ``I knew I wasn't in Long Beach when I dropped out of the
overcast over Dublin,'' he said. ``The place was greener and some
of the houses had hay roofs.''
   Corrigan will be the guest of Aer Lingus on Sunday when the
Irish airline takes him to Dublin aboard a Boeing 747.
   ``We offered him a first-class seat, but he said he would prefer
to fly economy,'' said Aer Lingus spokesman Bill Maxwell in Dublin.
