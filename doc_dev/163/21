   The ticker tape parade Wednesday for Nelson
Mandela is the fifth in the last 10 years through New York's
``Canyon of Heroes'' on lower Broadway.
   There have been about twoscore such parades since Charles
Lindbergh was lionized here in 1927. Aviators, athletes and
warriors predominate.
   Among the notable parades:
   1986 _ New York Mets, after beating the Boston Red Sox in the
World Series.
   1985 _ 25,000 Vietnam veterans, led by Gen. William Westmoreland
and 26 Medal of Honor winners, in a 10-years-later welcome-home
tribute.
   1984 _ 221 athletes of the U.S. Olympic team are cheered, but
101 spectators are injured when a construction scaffold on the
parade route gives way.
   1981 _ Welcome home for the Americans hostages freed from Iran.
   1979 _ Pope John Paul II.
   1978 _ New York Yankees world champion team.
   1969 _ ``Miracle'' Mets world champion team.
   1969 _ Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first men
to land on the moon, and fellow Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins.
   1963 _ Astronaut Gordon Cooper.
   1962 _ Astronaut John Glenn, the first American in orbit.
   1958 _ Van Cliburn, the only classical musician ever to get the
ticker-tape treatment, after winning piano competition in Moscow.
   1951 _ Gen. Douglas MacArthur, after his recall from Korea by
President Truman.
   1938 _ Douglas ``Wrong-Way'' Corrigan, for his air flight to
Ireland while claiming his destination was Los Angeles.
   1938 _ Howard Hughes and his plane crew, for breaking Wiley
Post's round-the-world flight record.
   1936 _ Beryl Markham, for the first westward trans-Atlantic solo
flight, described later in her memoir ``West With the Night.''
   1928 _ Amelia Earhart, first woman to fly the Atlantic, as
navigator, before making her own solo flight some years later.
   1927 _ Lindbergh, after returning from solo flight to Paris.
   Several of the parades were larger in scope than the traditional
route from Bowling Green to City Hall, a canyon about 16 blocks
long formed by the office towers along Broadway in the financial
district.
   Glenn's parade, which wended through midtown as well as lower
Manhattan, produced the greatest fallout of paper in any ticker
tape parade, 3,474 tons, according to Sanitation Department records.
   The most paper generated by a canyon-only parade was 1,262 for
the Iran hostage parade.
   Official estimates of spectator numbers have been extravagant.
The Mets' 1986 parade was reported as drawing 2.2 million people.
That works out to 137,000 people per block, or enough to fill Shea
Stadium 2{ times.
