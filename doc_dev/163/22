   A bit of aviation history was made in this
city where Charles Lindbergh learned to fly.
   Twenty corporate aircraft, half of them the popular Learjets,
were put on the auction block Wednesday in a first-of-its-kind
event for the aircraft industry.
   ``This has never been done before in aviation, save for an
occasional bankruptcy sale and sales of smaller or antique
planes,'' said J. Robert Duncan, president of Duncan Aviation.
   The sale was also a first for Sotheby's, the international
auction house that specializes in fine art and antiques. John L.
Marion, the head of Sotheby's North American operations, wielded
the gavel.
   Within an hour, Duncan crews wheeled the aircraft, one-by-one,
through a clean aircraft hangar. There, Marion bellowed the
auctioneer's mantra: ``I have $2 million to start, I have 2
million.''
   When it was over, five airplanes had been sold for a total of
$7,927,750. Two others, including the most expensive one offered,
were snapped up before the sale, bringing the total to more than
$20 million, Marion said.
   Duncan, who heads the 30-year-old business aviation sales and
service with 550 employees in 14 cities, said he was pleased with
the sale, but had greater expectations.
   ``We'll analyze the results and evaluate whether or not we want
to make this an annual event. I think we might have another sale,''
he said.
   Prices paid ranged from $309,750 for a 1980 Piper Cheyenne I to
``about $14 million to $15 million'' for a 1988 Canadair Challenger
_ one of the two sold before the auction, Duncan said.
   Gary Conklin, a representative of Great Planes Sales Inc. of
Tulsa, Okla., picked up a Westwind 1124 for $2.1 million. He said
his company buys planes, renovates them and then looks for a buyer.
   The names of other buyers were not made public.
   Lindbergh studied flying at the old Lincoln School of Aviation
in the 1920s. He made his solo flight of the Atlantic in May 1927.
