   A grisly find on a country golf course has
police culling clues from around the nation, but so far detectives
are baffled about the identity of a woman whose head was discovered
lying along a brook.
   Police say they may have to use the lastest technology of modern
forensics to determine the victim's identity.
   ``We have nothing concrete,'' said Hopewell Township Police Lt.
Michael Chipowski. ``We've gotten dozens of calls about people who
haven't been seen for a while, but they haven't led anywhere.''
   Chipowski said the case has recently drawn more than 200 leads
and inquiries from across the nation.
   ``Probably nothing has stirred up such excitement here since the
Lindbergh case,'' Chipowski said, referring to the trial of Bruno
Hauptmann, who was convicted in a nearby courthouse of murdering
flying ace Charles Lindbergh's baby son a half century ago.
   ``This is certainly out of the ordinary. It's a real mystery,''
he said.
   The female human head was discovered March 5 by a golfer whose
errant shot sent him searching for his ball along the bank of a
brook at the Hopewell Valley Golf Club north of Trenton. Chipowski
said police believe the killing occurred just before the discovery
because there was fresh makeup on the head and ``the features were
in a good state.''
   ``We have about 30 leads yet to complete,'' said Chipowski.
``We'll run down every one of them.''
