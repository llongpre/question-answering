<LEADPARA>  IT WAS called the Crime of the Century even when the century was young, and
nearly 60 years later it still is. The 1932 kidnapping and subsequent death of
Charles and Anne Lindbergh's infant son from his second-floor nursery in New
Jersey had suspense, an innocent child victim, a fortune in lost ransom and a
fabulous cast of celebrity characters -- suspects, investigators, psychics,
opportunists.;    And conspiracy theories. Bruno Richard Hauptmann was
executed for the crime, but the Lindbergh case was marked by bad police work,
squabbling public agencies, personal ambition and greed. If Hauptmann was
innocent -- and the case against him was certainly flawed -- then it would
seem that almost anyone in America could have kidnapped Charles Lindbergh Jr.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But who did?;    Maybe only Nate Heller knows for sure. Heller's a
detective, the creation of a writer named Max Allan Collins, and he's appeared
in four other novels. But "Stolen Away: A Novel of the Lindbergh Kidnapping"
(Bantam Books, 516 pp., $22.50), is surely his finest hour.;    Heller is the
youngest plainclothesman on the Chicago police force, and in the early days
after the kidnapping, when Al Capone is still a suspect, Heller is sent off to
be Chicago's liaison with the New Jersey state cops.;    The case is a mess.
The Jersey cops have botched the fingerprinting and crime-scene investigation,
and they are not reporting to law enforcement officials, but to Lindy himself,
who knows a lot about aviation but nothing about police work. He considers his
servants above reproach, for example, and does not allow them to be
interrogated, despite evidence that there is an inside connection in the
kidnapping. Whenever there is a lead, Lindy keeps the cops on a leash; he
wants to pay the ransom and get his son back.;    Heller sees that Slim -- as
Lindbergh's friends call him -- can't win. He's trying to play by the rules in
a game run by cheaters.;    Heller is a likable gumshoe who reminds me of
Archie Goodwin, sidekick to Rex Stout's formidable Nero Wolfe. He's roughly
honest but no prig, smart but no genius, a great drinking partner and a
capable adversary. Of course, Goodwin had the genius Wolfe behind him. Heller
isn't so lucky.;    Working awkwardly with the inept police and with
interested Washington heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean -- a hot number, if there
ever was one -- Heller confronts a Gordian knot of clues and false leads.
There are three strings of suspects he can dismiss as crackpots or schemers,
except that each of these groups has some piece of information that only the
kidnapper could have. When Heller draws together a theory that explains
everything, a fellow investigator scoffs that things are becoming too
Byzantine. Heller replies, "If you'd care to point out any one part of this
case that has ever made rational sense, I'll slip on my raincoat and go home.
Right now.";    Heller's theory is cockeyed, as it turns out. But it's close
enough to trigger one last brilliant and astonishing revelation, a solution
that brings the book full circle and resonates right into the 1990s.;   
"Stolen Away" is a great suspense novel, backed by considerable research and
stylishly told in the fast, slangy style of the jazz age. Heller gets beat up
too often to be in the top rank of detectives, but Collins is certainly among
the elite of his craft.;  WESTERN CIVILIZATION: Douglas C. Jones' "The Search
for Temperance Moon" (Henry Holt, 324 pp., $22.50) is a rich elegy to
tumultuous Fort Smith, Ark., as its chapter of the Old West came to a fitful,
violent close at the end of the 19th century.;    Fort Smith, home of Isaac
Parker, the legendary "Hanging Judge," was the gateway to the Indian Nations,
the home in exile of the so-called Five Civilized Tribes -- Cherokee, Creek,
Choctaw, Chickasaw and Seminole. Civilized they may have been, in the dubious
sense that they had long been influenced by white ways, but the Nations were
far from civil. There was probably no more lawless place on earth.;    As
Jones writes of one character:;    Never having had the advantage of an
education at such places as Mrs. Sawyer's Female Seminary in Fayetteville,
Arkansas, Winona had learned the white man's talk from almost thirty years of
association with bootleggers, horse thieves, railroad roustabouts, Texas
cattle drovers, land speculators, Baptist evangelists, pimps, bank robbers,
and murderers. In short . . . she was a true daughter of the old Indian
Territory.;    If Winona Crowfoot is the corrupted, Temperance Moon is the
corrupt. Known as the Bandit Queen of the Indian Territory, Temperance --
daughter of a Protestant minister -- numbers a handful of true desperadoes
among her successive husbands. From one she's taken her last name and from
another a farm in Creek Nation that serves as a general headquarters for the
region's drunks, thieves and killers.;    Then Temperance Moon gets her head
shot off, and the likeliest suspect is found dead soon after. The U.S.
Marshal's office closes the case, but Jewel Moon, Temperance's daughter and
the proprietor of a whorehouse, pays former deputy Oscar Schiller in
greenbacks and cocaine to find out who killed her mother -- and why.;     As
Oscar and his hand-picked partners peel away the layers of guilt and sin,
Arkansan Jones paints an unforgettable picture of a colorful place and time.
His fine prose is never hurried, and, though the violence comes seldom and
suddenly, the air is ever heavy with menace.;    I've always liked Jones'
Westerns, but this is his best. That means it's as good as they get.;  THE
TRAGI-COMICS: Starfire, the comic-strip creation that is central in San
Franciscan Mary-Rose Hayes' romantic "Paper Star" (E.P. Dutton, 359 pp.,
$19.95), is an extra-terrestrial environmental superhero -- a little close
conceptually to Turner Broadcasting Systems' Saturday morning "Captain
Planet.";    A project to bring the sci-fi heroine alive in the movies unites
four friends: Vera Brown, the sometimes-obese creator of Starfire; "Saint"
(That's Sloane St. John Treadwell Jr.), who scripts the strip; Jo-Beth "J.B."
Feeney, tormented actress/model who is the inspiration and screen incarnation
of Starfire; and Arnie Blaize, a matinee idol who has sought in drugs relief
from his yearning for an identity. The four, all emotionally needy, fall into
the web of Victor Diamond, influential Hollywood producer, insidious
manipulator and -- just possibly -- Saint's father.;    I like these
characters. Vera, in particular, is vital and real, and refreshingly different
from the cookie-cutter heroines of much romantic fiction.;    But ultimately,
this book stands or falls with Starfire, the comic-strip creation. And Hayes
doesn't quite bring her off.;    When Saint and J.B. first see Vera's
pre-professional strips, they are convulsed with laughter, which doesn't seem
the right response to this kind of strip at all. Hours later, they part, and
Vera, initiating a three-way hug, says, "The Starfire Trio, right? Through
thick and thin." Now, considering that Saint and J.B. have only just heard of
Starfire, and that they happen to be up to their eyeballs in one fresh killing
and an old one, the cartoon character is an unlikely bonding agent.;    All
through "Paper Star," Hayes wants us to embrace Starfire as more than we can.
It's a shame, because the "real" people here, and much of the story, are
compelling.;  ' "Can you scare them, men like that?";    "When you put a gun
in their mouth, you can.";    "But would the police do that?";    "Evalyn, I
am the police." ';    -- From "Stolen Away"; by Max Allan Collins;  ' That was
the only conversation as they ate. And Tishacomsie took the food to her mouth
with delicate fingers as surely as did the men, without reserve, without any
thought that she was different from them, and all the while her dark gaze
fastened on Oscar Schiller's face like a cat looking at a caged bird. In fact,
both Indians sized up the white man, and Oscar Schiller reciprocated in kind.
With intense curiosity on both sides to ensure that everything was as it had
been in the past, that there was still trust between them. '; -- From "The
Search for Temperance Moon"; by Douglas C. Jones;  ' Now Saint stared
longingly at the bright porthole that might be hers and wished he could go
there and be held in her arms and be comforted and strengthened. He wanted to
lay his head on her breast and cry: This is a bad man, Vera, he's dangerous
and cruel and evil, I'm totally indebted to him -- and I think he might be my
father. What am I going to do? '; -- From "Paper Star"; by Mary-Rose Hayes  </TEXT>
