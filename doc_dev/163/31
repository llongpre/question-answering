   President Bush's highly publicized distaste for
broccoli will only increase consumption of the vitamin-rich
vegetable, one proponent says.
   ``It's wonderful stuff. We sell tons of it,'' said William
Quinn, produce manager for the Outpost Natural Foods supermarket.
   Asked if Bush's move to ban the vegetable from Air Force One's
larder might affect sales of broccoli, Quinn said: ``Yes, among our
customers, I think it will increase them.''
   ``The man can't enjoy one of the best fruits of the earth,''
piped in Harriet Behar, whose Sweet Earth Farm near Gays Mills in
southwestern Wisconsin markets about 15,000 broccoli plants
annually.
   Bush's thumbs-down for broccoli made headlines when he told
questioning reporters on Thursday, ``I do not like broccoli and I
haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat
it and I'm president of the United States and I'm not going to eat
any more broccoli.''

   Tommy Bengaff won $25,000 at a blackjack
table in Atlantic City, and forked out $23,000 of it on his
mother's 60th birthday bash.
   Melba Bengaff and 65 of her closest friends celebrated her
birthday in grand style in a Bellevue Avenue mansion.
   Her 25-year-old son laid on a five-piece band, 20 chauffeured
limousines and a $45-a-plate meal, put up five guests from New York
City at a hotel and arranged a family vacation on the Caribbean
island of Aruba.
   ``It's my mother's 60th birthday and she means the world to
me,'' Bengaff said. ``You only have one mom. Mom and I are like
brother and sister. I know if she had the money she'd do it for
me.''
   Bengaff, a $25,000-a-year manager at a grocery store in Cranston
and owner of King's West Bay Limousine Service, said that last
October ``it came into my mind that I wanted to do something big. I
just didn't know where or how big.''
   A three-hour visit at a blackjack table in Atlantic City on New
Year's Eve took care of the money problem.
   ``My father told me to save it or put into an IRA, not to spend
it on one night in Newport,'' Bengaff said.

   A social worker paid $3,000 for the
large wooden crate that was used to ship Charles Lindbergh's plane
back to the United States after his historic flight to Europe in
1927.
   Larry Ross, 38, of Canaan, Maine, the executive director of a
social service agency, said he is convinced the crate is
historically significant. He wants to renovate it as a summer
cottage.
   The crate has lain for years in woods near Contoocook, and has
been used by passers-by in search of free housing. It has windows
and a door, and at one time had electricity and a phone, but it has
fallen into disrepair in recent years.
   ``It's not an awful lot to look at,'' said Ross, who plans to
load up the crate early this week.
   Ross bought the crate from David Price Sr., who took possession
of it five years ago when he bought the land from the grandson of
Admiral Guy Burrage.
   Burrage's ship brought Lindbergh and the crate back to the
United States. They became friends, the aviator gave him the crate
and Burrage turned it into a summer cottage.
   Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean
from the United States to France in the Spirit of St. Louis.
   ``It struck me as a unique piece of Americana that has a certain
New England eccentricity to it,'' Ross said. ``Some people look at
me like, `Are you crazy?' Other people get a real charge out of
it.''
