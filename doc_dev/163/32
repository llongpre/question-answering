   Today is Wednesday, Jan. 24, the 24th day of 1990. There are 341
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Twenty-five years ago, on Jan. 24, 1965, former British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill died in London at the age of 90.
   On this date:
   In 1848, James W. Marshall discovered a gold nugget at Sutter's
Mill in northern California, a discovery that led to the gold rush
of '49.
   In 1908, the first Boy Scout troop was organized in England by
Robert Baden-Powell.
   In 1916, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal income tax was
constitutional.
   In 1922, Christian K. Nelson of Onawa, Iowa, patented the Eskimo
Pie.
   In 1924, the Russian city of Petrograd was renamed Leningrad in
honor of the revolutionary leader, who had just died.
   In 1935, Bruno Hauptmann took the stand in his New Jersey trial
on charges of kidnapping and murdering the infant son of aviator
Charles Lindbergh.
   In 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill concluded a wartime conference in
Casablanca, Morocco.
   In 1978, a crippled, nuclear-powered Soviet satellite plunged
through Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated, scattering
radioactive debris over parts of northern Canada.
   In 1982, the San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowl XVI, defeating
the Cincinnati Bengals 26-21 at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich.
   In 1986, the Voyager 2 made its closest approach to the planet
Uranus, coming within 51,000 miles.
   In 1987, about 20,000 civil rights demonstrators marched through
nearly all-white Forsyth County, Ga., a week after a smaller march
was disrupted by Ku Klux Klan members and supporters.
   In 1987, gunmen in Lebanon kidnapped three American teachers and
an Indian professor from Beirut University College. (Mithileshwar
Singh, the Indian educator, was later released.)
   Ten years ago: The Carter administration announced a major
change in U.S. policy, saying it was willing to sell military
equipment to China.
   Five years ago: The space shuttle Discovery was launched from
Cape Canaveral, Fla., on the first secret, all-military shuttle
mission, a journey that lasted three days.
   One year ago: Confessed serial killer Theodore Bundy was put to
death in Florida's electric chair for the 1978 kidnap-murder of one
of his victims, 12-year-old Kimberly Leach.
   Today's Birthdays: Television producer Mark Goodson is 75. Actor
Ernest Borgnine is 73. Evangelist Oral Roberts is 72. Former Sen.
Paula Hawkins, R-Fla., is 63. Singer-songwriter Neil Diamond is 49.
Former State Department official Elliott Abrams is 42. Actress
Nastassja Kinski is 29. Gymnast Mary Lou Retton is 22.
   Thought for Today: ``History with its flickering lamp stumbles
along the trail of the past, trying to reconstruct its scenes, to
revive its echoes, and kindle with pale gleams the passion of
former days. What is the worth of all this? The only guide to a man
is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude
and sincerity of his actions.'' _ Winston Churchill.
