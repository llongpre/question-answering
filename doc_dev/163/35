   A cramped and nerve-wracking airport and no
room to build a new one has San Diego in a tight spot.
   It's hard to imagine a more picturesque setting for an
international airport _ on a bayfront flanked by rolling hills,
glassy skyscrapers and the gray magnificence of a Navy fleet.
   But to pilots who are forced by downtown buildings to descend
steeply on approach to Lindbergh Field, the setting for the airport
serving the nation's sixth largest city is all wrong.
   ``It's the worst airport in the world,'' said Tom Carroll of the
Air Line Pilots Association.
   Some would call than an exaggeration, but a 1988 survey of 1,360
pilots found Lindbergh Field tied in fith place with Denver's
Singleton Airport as the least safe airport in the United States.
   Transportation planners and civic leaders, who eye the land that
Lindbergh sits on for downtown expansion, have spent 30 years
searching for a replacement. The most frequently discussed option
is to convert the Miramar Naval Air Station to a commercial or
joint-use airport.
   The Navy is adamantly opposed to any such plan.
   Unless an alternative is found by the turn of the century,
Lindbergh, built in 1928, could throw a wrench into the region's
robust economy.
   ``San Diego is running into an economic buzz saw if we wait any
longer,'' said Dan Pegg, president of the San Diego Economic
Development Corp.
   ``It's absolutely the toughest issue in San Diego,'' said Jack
Koerper, the director of special projects for the San Diego
Association of Governments, the regional planning agency conducting
the airport search.
   Squeezed onto 485 acres, Lindbergh is surrounded by San Diego
Bay, the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, businesses, residential areas
and rolling hills.
   ``One pilot likened it to landing in a shoebox,'' said Dick
Russell of the pilots association.
   ``I cannot and will not say it's unsafe, but I will say a pilot
flying into Lindbergh has to be on the ball at all times. There's
very little room for error,'' he said.
   Lindbergh handled 11 million people last year, but planners say
its saturation point may come in five to 10 years, the time to make
another airport operational. A new airport would have to serve
about 40 million passengers by 2050, aviation planners and civic
leaders say.
   Despite some 40 studies since 1960, no consensus has developed
on an alternative to Lindbergh.
   One proposal called for a binational airport on Otay Mesa, at
the Mexican border, but that would require the negotiation of
international agreements with Mexico.
   Other possibilities include a ``hub-and-spoke'' concept in which
a main airport would be constructed in Imperial Valley, some 100
miles to the east, with travelers shuttled to San Diego on smaller
planes or a high-speed train.
   An offshore, or ``floating'' airport also has been discussed.
   Around San Diego, options have dwindled as urban sprawl gobbled
undeveloped land.
   ``The only place that development hasn't preempted is Miramar
and that's because the Navy has preserved it,'' said county
supervisor Brian Bilbray.
   But the cost of replacing the air base, home to the ``Top Gun''
pilot school, would be $10 billion, said U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery,
R-San Diego.
   ``Miramar is not an option,'' said Lowery. ``The Navy's not just
said `no.' They've said, `Hell, no.' ''
