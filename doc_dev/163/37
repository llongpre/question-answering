   Arnulfo Arias Madrid, who long dominated civilian
politics in Panama even though deposed from the presidency three
times by the military, died Wednesday of a heart attack. He was 87.
   Arias, who lived in exile in Miami, was educated in the United
States and became active in his new nation's politics as early as
1931, when he helped engineer a coup against the president. He
later was ambassador to France and England, and in Europe became
enamored of Mussolini's fascism.
   Arias returned to advocate it in Panama, and was elected
president in 1940-41, 1949-51 and for 11 days in 1968. Each time,
he was ousted by the Military. In 1986 Arias accused the military
of killing opposition leader Dr. Hugo Spadafora, who had accused
Noriega's government of involvement with drugs. This year in Miami,
Noriega was indicted for alleged drug trafficking.

   Adela Rogers St. Johns, a reporter
who covered the Lindbergh kidnapping trial and was a friend of
former President Nixon and newspaper magnate William Randolph
Hearst, died Wednesday at age 94.

charged in the kidnapping and murder of aviator Charles A.
Lindbergh's infant son. She was a longtime friend of former
President Nixon, who in 1970 honored her as the only woman among
eight journalists awarded the Medal of Freedom, the nation's
highest civilian honor.
