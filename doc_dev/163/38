6,300-mile solo-rowing adventure across the Pacific Ocean from Japan.;

<TEXT>     D'Aboville, 42, was cheered by a crowd that included family, friends and
dozens of French journalists as he eased his kayak-like boat into the dock 134
days after he began his grueling voyage.;   The U.S. Coast Guard escorted
d'Aboville across the Columbia River bar, the area of turbulence where river
currents collide with ocean waves. As he approached the coast this morning, he
celebrated with a glass of red wine.;   He remained in the boat after he
docked, hugging his wife, Cornelia, who had climbed aboard.;   D'Aboville had
been expected to arrive as early as 9 a.m., but his progress was slower than
expected in waters known for dangerous currents and tricky winds. He came in
shortly before noon.;   On Wednesday, D'Aboville spoke by radio with his wife
and parents. He sounded "exuberant," said Christophe Hebert, a member of his
support team. "He said he was really happy to arrive. It was very hard for him
the last few days.";   D'Aboville's personal physician, Dr. Jean Yves Chauve,
said he was in good health.;   D'Aboville set out from Choshi, Japan, on July
11 in a bid to become the second person to row alone across the Pacific. He
had set a course for San Francisco but headed farther north to escape a
troublesome current and shorten the journey.;   His boat capsized at least 34
times. On Tuesday, it flipped several times in 80 mph winds and 28-foot seas
about 70 miles offshore. He suffered a cut on his forehead and injured his
back.;   Peter Bird of Britain rowed some 9,000 miles from San Francisco to
Australia in 1982-83. D'Aboville's west-to-east journey was considered more
difficult because of the ocean currents.;   The adventure was sponsored by
Sector Sport Watches, a Swiss company.;   "It really is a remarkable event,
not unlike Charles Lindbergh," said Jerry Ostermiller, director of the
Columbia River Maritime Museum. "I think it is heroic."  </TEXT>
