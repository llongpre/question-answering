LINDBERGH NEEDS A SHORT-TERM FIX; 
</P>
<P>
BUT SEARCH FOR NEW SITE SHOULD BE PRESSED BEFORE SPENDING $289 MILLION OR MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's hard to argue with much of what Lindbergh Field's many critics have to 
say. The downtown airport is in the wrong place for a growing metropolis, 
making for some white-knuckle flying past city skyscrapers. The single runway 
is uncomfortably short, maybe dangerously so. The noise created by takeoffs 
over Point Loma and Loma Portal is horrendous. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Lindbergh has to be moved. We all know it. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if city leaders picked a site tomorrow, there would be no new airport 
for at least a decade, probably more. That's why Lindbergh must be expanded to 
handle passenger traffic that is expected to steadily increase over the next 
decade. The continued growth of San Diego's economy also demands it. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the question of how much expansion is necessary. For now, the 
$27-million emergency plan already adopted by the Port District appears 
adequate. We see no reason for the port to leap ahead with either of two very 
expensive expansion plans that would take Lindbergh into the early part of next 
century, and in the process take the urgency out of the new effort to create a 
binational airport on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The interim plan now being implemented would take care of Lindbergh's most 
critical needs. It would move the leaking fuel tanks that supply Lindbergh's 
jets, increasing fuel storage capacity limited by Lindbergh's cramped 
configuration. That would take trucks that must constantly replenish 
Lindbergh's one-day fuel supply off Harbor Drive. It would add eight passenger 
gates and baggage claim areas. It would build a better access route to Harbor 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Those improvements would allow Lindbergh to accommodate about 16.5 million 
passengers, the number expected to use the airport by 1996 or 1997. The two 
major expansion options -- one costing $289 million, the other priced at $385 
million -- are designed to stretch airport capacity to about 24 million, the 
number of passengers expected by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be time to consider those options in the future. The port 
should set itself a reasonable short-term deadline for determining if the 
latest effort is going to take off. If it doesn't -- and recent history does 
not indicate much hope of success -- the Port can take up the expansion plans 
discussed at this week's public hearing. That hearing was held only because the 
City Council asked for it. 
</P>
<P>
If the port is in the mood to spend money, it might want to consider purchasing 
the ill-conceived Laurel Travel Center at the foot of the runway and taking it 
down a level or two. That would ameliorate the fears of pilots who have called 
it an accident waiting to happen -- regardless of the FAA's opinion that the 
building is not a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a mistake to derail the effort to relocate Lindbergh to a better 
spot by making plans to expand the current site to accommodate 24 million 
people.
