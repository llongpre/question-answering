AVIATION: THE PANEL SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE FOR LINDBERGH FIELD WANTS MORE TIME 
AND MONEY TO DO THE JOB. ONE COUNCILMAN CALLS IT A WASTE.

The panel studying the relocation of Lindbergh Field agreed Thursday to extend 
its review another year and spend $350,000 to $400,000 more to examine the 
"multiple airport option" unveiled last month by San Diego City Councilmen Ron 
Roberts and Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
If approved today by the San Diego Assn. of Governments' Board of Directors, 
the Airport Policy Advisory Committee's recommendation would about double the 
cost and duration of the search for an alternative to increasingly crowded 
Lindbergh Field, a study financed by a $350,000 Federal Aviation Administration 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
But Filner, who with Roberts led the call for a look at the two-airport plan, 
said the effort will be worthless because of restrictions on the scope of the 
study imposed by the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete waste of money," Filner said after the panel's meeting. "It's 
just a complete waste of money." 
</P>
<P>
Filner claimed that, as now written, the new study will automatically reject 
the multiple-airport option and point toward the three alternatives already 
identified by the Sandag airport committee: Miramar Naval Air Station, a tract 
east of Miramar and a huge parcel on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the new examination will require that at least one of the 
region's airports accommodate 20 million passengers annually, a 12,000-foot 
runway, 5,000-foot safety zones at either end of the runway, simultaneous 
landings on widely separated landing strips, and full instrument-landing 
capacity. Under consideration would be Lindbergh, Brown and Montgomery fields 
in San Diego, Gillespie Field in El Cajon and McClellan-Palomar Airport in 
Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Filner and Roberts' multiple airport option is based on the assumption that no 
site in the county could accommodate the estimated 35 million airline 
passengers expected to fly here by the middle of next century. It seeks to 
determine whether the load could be parceled out to Lindbergh and an expanded 
Brown Field, along with Montgomery and McClellan-Palomar airports. The Sandag 
panel added Gillespie to the list. 
</P>
<P>
The councilmen believe that Miramar could handle the traffic, but believe it is 
politically unlikely that the Navy would allow a civilian or joint-use airport 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts aide Wayne Raffesberger said the safety zone and runway length 
requirements would rule out Lindbergh, and the safety zone and 
instrument-landing requirements would appear to eliminate the expanded Brown 
Field plan unveiled by the councilmen last month with the help of a coalition 
of South Bay landowners. But he was hesitant to condemn the study entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"Those criteria, if strictly applied would appear to eliminate all five of 
those airports, I think," Raffesberger said. But, he added, "I don't know what 
to make of it yet. We hadn't seen those criteria." Roberts is attending an 
Urban Land Institute meeting out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hedy St. John, chairwoman of the study panel's technical committee, said she 
"would respectfully disagree" with Filner's assessment, arguing that, even at 
Lindbergh, land could be purchased to accommodate 5,000-foot safety zones at 
either end of the airport's 9,400-foot single runway. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she argued, safety criteria should not be compromised at the 
beginning of the study. "To compromise the standards and give the people of 
this region inadequate air and ground safety is not acceptable as a starting 
point," St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Line Pilots Assn., which favors the joint use of Miramar as the safest 
alternative, endorsed the safety criteria at a meeting of the technical 
committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay politicians, including U.S. Rep. Jim Bates, D-San Diego, State Sen. 
Wadie Deddeh, D-Chula Vista, and Filner, will ask Sandag in a letter to be 
delivered today to consider the joint use of Miramar, Filner said. An ALPA 
official also has signed that letter, he said.
