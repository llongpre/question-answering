<LEADPARA>  It's a long way from banging out Led Zeppelin guitar riffs to producing blimps
that really fly.;    But two former Memphis musicians have built a half-dozen
flying machines since leaving rock 'n' roll a decade ago. And the U.S. Army
may soon be flying their latest egg-shaped, helium-filled creation.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HOW 2 ENTREPRENEURS BUILT A BETTER BLIMP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Originally designed as a single-seat sport flying vehicle, the four-finned,
60-foot-long blimp known, unromantically, as the Z-200, also happened to meet
Army specifications for a remote-controlled observation and communications
platform.;    Last summer, a research and development team from Westinghouse
Electric Corp.'s defense contracting division was dispatched to Memphis to
meet Memphis Airships owners Steve Garner and Jim Groce.;    The two sides
struck a deal, and now a vanilla white blimp bearing Army and Westinghouse
insignia awaits flight testing at the Memphis Airships' Presidents Island
hangar.;    "It looks so great that sometimes it's hard to contain the urge to
just hop in it and fly," said Garner, 39, a former engineering student at the
University of Florida and the University of Tennessee. "But our company's
future is riding on this thing -- and besides, it belongs to them -- not us.";
   Westinghouse, a giant Pittsburgh-based electronics firm, paid about $50,000
for the blimp. Company officials have not decided whether it will be flown
first by a pilot or through a ground-based remote control system. Flight tests
are scheduled for early 1991, and Garner and Groce want to get started.;   
"We've fulfilled our construction contract, and we are now waiting for the
operational contract," Garner said. "Our program doesn't seem to have been
affected by federal budget cuts, and we look forward to showing people how
well it can perform.";    The 9,500-cubic foot blimp has roughly one-tenth the
volume of a typical hot-air balloon. It is designed to have a 43 mph top
speed, a 32 mph cruise speed and a maximum ceiling of 6,500 feet. It will be
able to carry up to 275 pounds -- enough to hoist radar equipment for
monitoring borders, video cameras for surveillance or high-tech communications
systems.;    Garner and Groce say they don't know how the blimps will be used
-- and the Army isn't saying.;    But armies and dirigibles have a long and
not-so-illustrious history. The first air raid was carried out by German
dirigibles over England during World War I, when crew members tossed bombs out
by hand.;    The massive, hydrogen-filled dirigibles turned out to be as
explosive as their payloads, however, and made easy targets for British
airplanes and anti-aircraft guns.;    Before being pressed into military
service, dirigibles carried air mail in Germany as early as 1912. An English
dirigible was the first airborne vehicle to cross the Atlantic in 1919 --
eight years before Charles Lindbergh's famous solo flight.;    The golden age
of airships came to a famous and fiery finish in 1937 when the hydrogen-filled
Hindenburg exploded while trying to dock in Lakehurst, N.J., killing 37 of the
95 people aboard.;    The diminutive airships Garner and Groce make would be
dwarfed by the leviathans of yesteryear -- but the two say their products
could spur a blimp revival.;    "Companies could buy them for advertising
purposes -- like miniature versions of the Goodyear blimp," Garner said.;   
"Police could use them to watch traffic, scientists could use them to monitor
whale migrations along the California coast, and individuals could use them
for fun flying. There's no end to the potential uses.";    Civilian versions
will sell for about $50,000 each and are designed to fit Federal Aviation
Administration guidelines for ultra-light aircraft. That means pilots won't
need licenses to fly them.;    Garner and Groce say blimp buyers will be
required to pass an airship flying program on the grassy fields outside their
facility before they'll get the keys, however.;    The two claim their blimps
will be able to perform many of the same tasks as helicopters, but cheaper. A
Z-200's 24-horse-power engine burns about 2 1/2 gallons of fuel per hour
compared with about 25 gallons per hour for helicopters. A blimp can stay
airborne for about nine hours compared with about three for the helos.;    But
blimps are not without operational costs: It takes $1,000 in helium to fill a
Z-200, and the blimps need to be topped off every three or four months.;   
Garner and Groce say blimps are their passion, but their company's seven
full-time and three part-time employees earn most of their money making
inflatable advertisements: giant beer cans, tanning lotion, bottles, tires,
etc.;    The profitable advertising side of the business has supported blimp
endeavors in the past, but the two are counting on their new gas bag to change
all that.  </TEXT>
