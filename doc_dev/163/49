Jimsair Aviation Services, a San Diego aircraft fueling and service company 
with operations at San Diego's Lindbergh Field and in Palm Springs, has filed 
for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
President Phil Bracamonte said the company's high debt -- taken on to finance 
expansion -- coupled with a downturn in business forced it to seek protection 
from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no disruption of services and no layoffs of the company's 65 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Bracamonte said the company has $8.9 million in assets and 
$8.4 million in liabilities. Among the assets is a lease for hangar space 
through the year 2014 with the San Diego Unified Port District, operator of 
Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The company recently spent a considerable sum doubling its hangar space at 
Lindbergh, but Bracamonte said problems with the Palm Springs facility were 
more to blame for the financial difficulties that led to the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
The company's major creditors include Textron, First National Bank of San Diego 
and BP Oil, the firm's attorney Peter L. Duncan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jimsair filed its bankruptcy petition in the court of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge 
James W. Meyers. The company was founded in 1952, when it established a 
presence at Lindbergh, Bracamonte said. 
</P>
<P>
A sale of the company to Flightcraft of Portland, Ore. was announced last year 
but fell through. CHRIS KRAUL
