   A 16-year-old on Tuesday became the first
defendant convicted of attempted murder in the gang rape of the
Central Park Jogger. A second youth was acquitted of the same
charge and convicted of lesser charges.
   Spectators erupted in anger and shock when the verdicts were
returned against Kevin Richardson and Kharey Wise after 12 days of
jury deliberation.
   Richardson's mother, Grace Cuffey, fainted and the courtroom was
cleared while she was treated with oxygen at her seat.
   ``You're going to pay for this. Jesus is going to get you. You
made this ... up,'' Wise told prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer as he
was led from the courtroom in handcuffs.
   Richardson, 16, was convicted of attempted murder, rape, sodomy,
robbery, assault and riot. Wise, 18, loudly cursed Lederer after he
was acquitted of 10 of 13 counts against him, including attempted
murder, rape and sodomy. He was convicted of first-degree assault,
sexual abuse and riot.
   Three other teen-agers were convicted in August of rape and
assault in the case.
   Richardson and Wise were jailed without bail pending a Jan. 9
sentencing.
   Richardson, charged as a minor, faces a maximum prison term of
five to 10 years. Wise, charged as an adult, could receive nearly
nine to 26 years in prison if the judge orders him to serve the
terms concurrently.
   Wise admitted in a videotapd statement that the April 19, 1989,
attack on a woman investment broker ``was my first rape, and it
will be my last.''
   Wise's lawyer, Colin Moore, argued that police coerced the
statement from his client. Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau said he was pleased the jury had rejected that
allegation.
   ``A jury has rejected spurious claims that the police
manufactured evidence and used coercive tactics to obtain
confessions,'' Morgenthau said.
   The woman was not widely identified because she was a sexual
assault victim. Her case generated enormous public interest and
debate.
   Critics of the national media attention attributed it to her
status as a white investment banker in a city where minority crime
victims get less attention. Others cited her dramatic fight for
life, her recovery and return to work, and her quiet bravery.
   The verdicts came in the second trial stemming from the attack
on the woman, now 30, along a jogging path in Central Park. She
still suffers vision, balance and olfactory problems.
   Wise and Richardson wept and hugged each other when the verdicts
were read.
   ``I am obviously shattered, very, very disappointed,'' said
Richardson's attorney, Howard Diller. ``I'm really dismayed the
jury found him guilty on every single count. It's shocking.''
   Moore said ``a fair and just verdict would have been an
acquittal on all counts.''
   Both attorneys said they would appeal.
   Supporters of the defendants yelled at the judge and the
prosecutors.
   The woman, found about four hours after the attack, lost
three-fourths of her blood. Her skull was broken, her left
cheekbone was crushed and she had bruises all over her body.
   Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Raymond Santana, all 16, were
cnnvicted Aug. 18 of rape, assault and other charges in the case.
All were sentenced in September to five to 10 years in prison.
   Steven Lopez, 16, will be the last to face charges during a
trial scheduled for early next year.
   The second trial began much as the first had, with Lederer
saying the defendants' own words would convict them. Defense
lawyers charged videotaped statements were coerced by racist police
looking for black and Hispanic suspects.
   The statements were the prosecution's chief evidence.
   Wise described how the victim screamed, kicked and struggled
violently until she was struck unconscious with a rock.
   Lederer asked Wise whether he thought they had left the woman
dead.
   ``That's the way I looked at it,'' he said.
   Wise later said police hit and tricked him into fabricating the
confession. His attorney charged police and prosecutors with using
``Hitlerian tactics.''
   Diller compared the ``hue and cry'' in the case to that of the
arrest and conviction of Bruno Hauptmann in the 1932 kidnap-murder
of aviator Charles Lindbergh's infant son.
   Lederer insisted the case was ``not about race. It's about
violence. It's about right and wrong.''
   Juror Victoria Bryers said Wise was convicted of first-degree
assault because the jury felt he showed depraved indifference to
the jogger's plight.
   ``He was at the scene and left her to die,'' said Bryers, the
mother of three children.
