   The crew and builders of the Gossamer
Albatross, the first human-powered plane to fly across the English
Channel, plan to gather Saturday for a 10-year reunion of the
historic event.
   ``Just a get-together,'' explained Paul MacCready, the Monrovia
aeronautics engineer who designed the awkward-looking plane largely
held together with transparent tape.
   The private event is being held in a cavernous building where
Rose Bowl floats are assembled and the Gossamer Albatross II, a
backup of the original plane, is stored. The plane that made the
historic flight is displayed in the London Science Museum.
   Among the 60 or so crewmembers and their families planning to
attend is Bryan Allen, who was recruited for his skills as a pilot,
bicyclist and hang-glider to pedal the craft 23 miles from
Folkstone, England, to Cap Gris Nez, France, on June 12, 1979.
   Allen, now a 36-year-old computer software specialist for a
Pasadena firm, recalled the grueling two-hour, 49-minute flight as
``by far the most difficult thing I've ever done physically ... and,
I suppose, mentally.''
   Allen, flying the 70-pound craft just a few feet over the water,
battled cross winds, dehydration and fatigue before landing the
Gossamer Albatross on a beach, where crew members had to help him
stand up.
   ``By then, I didn't want to spend another tenth of a second in
the plane,'' he said.
   Despite the drama of the event, the flight turned out to have
little long-range practical application to aeronautic technology,
except for the use of a couple of materials now found on commercial
aircraft.
   ``Carbon filament and Kevlar, a compound used in some of the
control mechanisms, are sneaking their way into airlines,''
MacCready said.
   The $220,000 prize for the flight, put up by English
industrialist Henry Kremer, went to cover expenses.
   MacCready, 63, said the flight of the Gossamer Albatross was more
symbolic than anything, much like Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight
across the Atlantic.
   ``It helped change people's perceptions about how we can do more
with less,'' he said. ``We've reached an era of limits on Earth, so
it is really important.''
