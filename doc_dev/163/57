<LEADPARA>  AS the year 1990 waned and conflagration in the Persian Gulf became
increasingly likely, students, activists and members of Congress opposed to
U.S. military action began more and more to couch their anti-war arguments in
terms of America's disastrous misadventure in Vietnam.;    The rallying cry
heard from college campuses to the floor of both houses of Congress began to
sound like nothing so much as the rhetoric from Moratorium Day 1969. Senators
such as Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut,
representatives such as Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Barbara Boxer of
California, all of whom came of political age during the Vietnam debate,
seemed intent on renewing the late 1960s anti-battle cry to attempt to stymie
an impending battle in 1991.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     American media, equally intent on presenting the most basic of
point-counterpoint, took up the Vietnam analogy with a vengeance. Indeed, so
touched did America seem by the past agony in Southeast Asia that George Bush
and members of his administration began a regular round of assurances that
whatever happened in the Middle East, it wouldn't be another Vietnam.;   
Vietnam was both a ghastly mistake and a powerful anti-war paradigm.
Unfortunately, as a model it simply does not fit the situation in the gulf
very well. Today, those interested in historical parallels would do better to
look at America's painful, step-by-step and necessary immersion into the dark
currents of World War II than to America's most futile anti-communist
crusade.;    It can certainly be argued that 1990 is neither 1969 nor 1940.
But there are some important and transcendent parallels between the looming
conflagration in the Middle East, our current home front situation and
America's response to the growing world crisis between 1936 and 1941.;   
President Bush himself suggested as much in an interview aired last week with
David Frost during which he suggested that the world has faced "nothing of
this moral importance" since World War II.;    Unlike Vietnam, which fit
comfortably -- and ultimately disastrously -- within the confines of America's
postwar anti-communist theology, events in the Middle East, coupled with the
upheaval in Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War, certainly signal
fundamental shifts in the affairs of nations.;    These transformations, far
more than the Vietnam misadventure, mark a turning point. It is not out of the
question that we are facing changes in international boundaries and thinking
as potentially profound as those following the Napoleonic wars-induced
Congress of Vienna in 1815 or those that followed World War I, and in turn,
led directly to the rise of fascism in the 1930s and ultimately to World War
II.;    Critics of current U.S. policy have been quick to point out that it is
incorrect to compare Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler or to claim that Iraq has
the war-making potential of 1930s Germany. But before dismissing such a
suggestion, it might be wise to question whether the ability of industrially
unsophisticated nations to acquire nuclear and biological warfare capabilities
makes it a proposition that we test at our own peril.;    Equally, what seems
to have been forgotten is that as late as 1936, Hitler's Germany was neither
viewed as, nor in fact was, a credible threat to world stability and order.;  
 Indeed, in the middle 1930s, in enlightened circles both in Western Europe
and the United States, it was fashionable to view German rearmament as a
necessary, if not welcome, response to the onerous and humiliating diktat
following the 1918 armistice.;    Similarly, Saddam Hussein seems to be
regarded in some activist circles as the legitimate, even righteous, Arab
response to a century of Western imperialism.;    Fifty years ago, far less
credence was given to a doomster like Winston Churchill than to aviator and
isolationist Charles Lindbergh, who suggested that "measured by their own
standards of today, or by their enemy's standards of yesterday and tomorrow,
the Germans are as much in the right as England and France, for right is not
an absolute quality.";    How easily the words of Lindbergh, America's most
visible opponent to fighting World War II, would fit into the mouths of
today's anti-interventionists. Across a 50-year gulf, they suggest that
because nations have inherently different standards of behavior and because
statecraft is inherently immoral, America had, and has, no right to dictate to
a "nationalist" dictator like Saddam or Hitler.;    Such was the basis of
Lindbergh's famous plea: "If we enter fighting for democracy abroad, we may
end up by losing it at home.";    Hungry tigers; But if those words resonate
with America's Vietnam experience, they ring hollow today in terms of the
Persian Gulf crisis. Much more to the point would be Churchill's 1936 warning
that "dictators ride to and fro upon tigers which they dare not dismount. And
the tigers are getting hungry.";    In 1936, when Germany reoccupied the
Rhineland, Hitler knew that if he was faced by armed resistance from France or
England, his troops would fall back and his general staff would overthrow him.
But Hitler was the supreme bluffer, and the Western democracies, shattered by
the unparalleled slaughter of Verdun, Ypres and the Marne, were fearful of
calling his bluff and risking what leaders felt their electorates would never
accept.;    As the 1930s waned, and as the policy that British Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain termed "positive appeasement" led to the Anschluss of
Austria and the annexation of the Czechoslovakian Sudetenland, Germany's
strength grew.;    The horror of six years of total war taught the world that
"appeasement" was the ultimate diplomatic epithet. And that Hitler could and
should have been stopped in 1936 in the Rhineland became the most profound
international lesson of the 20th century.;    It was, however, not a lesson
learned short of conflict. Until the hour of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the
vast majority of Americans were opposed to declaring war on Germany or Japan.
Nevertheless, a majority then believed that, short of war, Great Britain
should be saved from the Nazi onslaught. Similarly, today, even if a near
majority feels that the United States should not attack Iraq, most Americans
feel strongly that Saddam's Anschluss of Kuwait cannot go unpunished.;    The
"America First" movement was a strange amalgam of pacifist leftists such as
actress Lillian Gish, novelist Kathleen Norris and Chester Bowles, the future
governor of Connecticut, right-wing isolationists such as commentator Fulton
Lewis Jr. and former President Herbert Hoover, and prairie progressives such
as Sens. William E. Borah of Idaho and Gerald Nye of North Dakota.;    Fifty
years later a strikingly similar and strange coalition of liberal legislators,
former government officials such as Robert McNamara and right-wing
commentators such as Patrick Buchanan and Edward Luttwak are aligned against
armed U.S. intervention in the Persian Gulf. And, ironically, the heart of the
anti-war movement still resides in America's prairie heartland.;    FDR
understood;  In 1940, the world was fortunate that Franklin Roosevelt,
understanding that democratic America could not survive in a world dominated
by fascist dictatorships, moved the United States by degree toward fighting
side by side with Great Britain.;    The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in
December 1941 ended any lingering doubt Americans might have had about the
price of isolationism and the toll of appeasement. It was a lesson that held
center stage in U.S. foreign policy until it was so tragically misapplied in
Vietnam.;    Vietnam, a far less vital interest to the United States than the
Persian Gulf is today, was viewed as a test of what John Kennedy in his
Inaugural Address called America's willingness to "pay any price, bear any
burden" for the defense of freedom. What that "freedom" meant exactly, few in
1960 questioned.;    Vietnam was set up as America's national test. Here was a
place so remote and a conflict so incomprehensible, that to fight here could
be a sign to the rest of the world of just how far the United States would be
willing to go to defend if not its "freedom," then at least its true vital
interests. After Vietnam, "freedom" and "national interest" became concepts
that were, rightly, not so easily defined or defended as they had been.;   
Dangerous crossroad;  The Persian Gulf crisis finds the United States at a
difficult and dangerous historical crossroad. If somehow war is avoided and
Saddam is in any way rewarded for his expansive course, then in one or two or
five years, the world will again be forced to come to terms with a vastly more
powerful and determined Iraq. It will be a nation armed with weapons of mass
destruction, with the backing of an Arab world as cowed as was pre-war Europe
by the appeasement of Hitler by the Western democracies. It also will be a
nation armed with the knowledge that the West was already tested, and found
wanting.;    Like Lindbergh, today's neo-isolationists would have us believe
that somehow, if only we are patient, we can sit down and negotiate with
Saddam and magically return things to the way they were before the invasion of
Kuwait.;    They are as wrong today as Lindbergh and Chamberlain were in the
dark time before World War II. The modern-day Arabian genie can no more be put
back into its bottle than Hitler could have been reasoned with at Munich.;   
The world today is not much less dangerous a place than it was then. At least
in our favor is the lesson of 1936-1941, which should have taught us that when
the tigers are hungry, appeasement is the quickest way to being swallowed
whole.  </TEXT>
