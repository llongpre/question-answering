   A pilot who landed his floatplane in
the North Pacific while completing the last leg of an
around-the-world flight was safe aboard a fishing vessel today.
   The Coast Guard was trying to determine whether his aircraft is
worth salvaging.
   Petty Officer Jeff Roberts said pilot Tom Casey was safely
aboard the fishing vessel Judy B, about 22 miles west of Kiska
Island in the western Aleutians.
   ``He's in good shape, excellent condition,'' Roberts said. ``The
last report we have is that the aircraft has a punctured pontoon
but is upright and floating. I guess he had some engine problems. .
.. Any decision about salvage will be made when the cutter
arrives.''
   Lt. Susan Hargiss said Casey alerted Coast Guard crews in Juneau
that he was in trouble shortly after 1:30 p.m. Thursday.
   A short time later, Casey was spotted by a Coast Guard C-130
transport plane responding to a distress signal from an emergency
locator beacon.
   Casey, 53, was unharmed and remained with his craft, the Liberty
II, while crews circled above late Thursday, Hargiss said.
   He is a Seattle-based pilot who was trying to complete a record
around-the-world flight by landing only on water.
   He was the first person to make the flight from Japan to Attu in
a single-engine floatplane since Charles Lindbergh logged the trip
decades ago, the Coast Guard said.
   Casey had landed his plane on oceans, and the lakes and rivers
of 20 nations.
   His around-the-world plan temporarily was stymied in Anchorage
during the summer when he was unable to gain travel clearances from
the Soviets.
