<TEXT>     Mr. Martin was a schoolboy fascinated by aviation and adept in mathematics
when he was hired by the Air Mail Service just out of high school.;   After
the mail service closed, he went to Streeter, Ill., where "on weekends he'd go
out with a pilot and walk on the wings of a flying plane to show people that
flying wasn't dangerous," recalled Mr. Martin's wife, Rodna, of San Carlos.;  
"Then, afterwards, they would take people up for rides at $5 a head.";   In
those days, Mr. Martin saw Charles Lindbergh, Wiley Post, Amelia Earhart and
other aviation pioneers when they passed through the airfields of Illinois.;  
His first airline job was with National Air Transport, one of United's four
predecessor companies, where he designed wings for the twin-cockpit Douglas
DM-4 mail plane so it could fly higher and land slower. He also developed the
first set of landing gear brakes for the DM-4.;   Mr. Martin was instrumental
in most major airframe modification projects through the DC-4 era.;   During
World War II, he was transferred to San Francisco to start United's
engineering department and to work on war projects. One of these was
development of carburetor filters.;   The United States was trying to chase
the forces of Gen. Erwin Rommel from the African desert, but planes averaged
only two missions because of engine failures caused by sand.;   A United
employee newsletter article states that Mr. Martin and his crew developed
filter systems for every type of U.S. plane then operating.;   Mr. Martin also
managed a project of converting military aircraft to carry people and cargo to
the South Pacific.;   After the war, Mr. Martin stayed in San Francisco and
led the company's engineering projects for the Pacific. When he retired in
1973, he was manager of customer service engineering. He lived in San Carlos
for 49 years.; (box)Born: Feb. 20, 1908, Bellwood, Ill.; (box)Died: Dec. 5,
1991, Redwood City, Calif.; (box)Survived by: Wife, Rodna Martin of San
Carlos; brother, Edward Martin of Dallas; sister, Natalie Thompson of
Modesto.; (box)Services: Funeral service has been held and burial was private.  </TEXT>
