   A pilot trying to become the first
aviator to fly around the world in a float plane got tangled in
some Soviet red tape on the second day of his voyage.
   Tom Casey, 53, began the trip from his hometown of Seattle and
reached Anchorage Monday, but he still hadn't received permission
to fly over the Soviet Union.
   He won't leave for his next stop in Nome until he gets the
go-ahead from Soviet authorities, he said.
   ``There seems to be some kind of problem _ I'm not sure what _
and I hope it's not going to be long,'' Casey said. ``They said it
had to do with technical difficulties with the airplane.''
   Casey is flying a single-engine Cessna equipped with pontoons
that allow it to take off and land only on water.
   Casey had submitted a flight plan to Soviet officials ``from
Nome to wherever they'd like me to go. I told them I wanted to go
from Nome, Alaska to Helsinki.''
   He suggested a route consisting of 500-mile legs between places
where he can land his plane called ``Liberty II,'' on water near an
airport.
   The voyage is timed to get Casey back to Seattle in time for the
opening ceremonies of the Goodwill Games on July 21. His departure
from Seattle on Sunday marked the 63rd anniversary of the beginning
of Charles A. Lindbergh's first solo trans-Atlantic flight.
   Casey's proposed 27,000-mile route roughly retraces the 1924
path of the first globe-circling flight by a pair of Douglas World
Cruisers, Casey said.
   ``I'm working out an alternate plan right now, through the
Aleutian chain through Attu, towards Japan. But I still need one
stop in the Soviet Union, in the Kuril Islands,'' he said.
   Casey and his project coordinator in Seattle, Dan Hood, planned
to contact Soviet air traffic officials today.
   His flight so far through Alaska, Casey said, was ``the way it's
always been _ beautiful.''
   He said he spent years flying in Alaska as a bush pilot.
   ``One main reason I'm doing this is I'm trying to promote the
safety and versatility of general aviation, especially in the Lower
48,'' he said.
   ``The only place that's left doing what aviation was originally
designed for is Alaska. Up here, flying is almost like driving a
car. You don't get all the problems that make flying difficult in
the rest of the United States. Up here it's survival. It should be
shown it's a very, very safe form of transportation.''
