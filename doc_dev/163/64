KEY TO AIRPORT SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The key ingredient to any ultimate solution regarding San Diego's airport 
expansion needs, be it Lindbergh Field or another site, continues to elude us. 
</P>
<P>
That necessary missing component is a commitment by all of our governmental 
representatives to get together behind a plan. 
</P>
<P>
For over 25 years, one governmental entity, the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors or the San Diego City Council, (usually driven by the elected 
officials representing Point Loma constituents living near Lindbergh Field), 
recycles the issue and institutes a study. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commissioners of the San Diego Unified Port District strive to 
maintain Lindbergh's safety and functionality as much as possible, never 
knowing from study to study if the airport is interim or long-term. Like 
Sisyphus and the proverbial stone, they are caught between the politics of 
other governmental entities, unhappy residents living under the flight path, 
noise-abatement lawsuits and responsibility for operating the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Assn. of Governments (Sandag) studies the problem, but has no 
real political clout to negotiate a solution on a regional basis. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed is a working commitment by the City Council, the Board of 
Supervisors and the county's entire congressional and legislative delegations. 
</P>
<P>
A solution will require the agreement, resources and all the political clout 
San Diego has, both locally and nationally. For example, a master plan 
encompassing the expertise and jurisdiction of every interested agency should 
be able to find a way to utilize Lindbergh Field and give it a real chance to 
succeed as a positive solution. 
</P>
<P>
If our government officials cannot get together behind the problem and cannot 
collectively find the power to influence the Department of Defense in 
Washington (if that's what's needed) to develop short- and long-term solutions, 
then we as citizens have elected the wrong people. 
</P>
<P>
Lindbergh Field is here to stay for at least 15 to 20 years. At the very 
minimum, consideration of public safety, growing air traffic demands and 
escalating costs of a new airport site require port, city/county and associated 
planners to merge their efforts to bring Lindbergh Field up to par on a 
short-term basis. In the process, they might also give it a chance to work as 
part of the solution to San Diego's long-term air traffic and transportation 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
An intergovernmental, nonpartisan, non-territorial effort is needed -- one that 
can be measured not by lip service or by committee attendance, but by results. 
</P>
<P>
If the idea caught on, who knows what other regional problems we could solve.
