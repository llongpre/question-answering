   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Unlike other proud fighting units in World War
II, such as the paratroopers and PT boat crews, the glider pilots
have been all but forgotten. The National World War II Glider
Pilots Association, which has about 1,300 members and was
instrumental in establishing a Silent Wings Museum in Terrell,
Texas, is dedicated to correcting that oversight.

   They were called the silent wings. The men
who flew them had a ``G'' _ for guts _ emblazoned on the silver
wings they wore on their uniforms.
   ``The mass of Americans don't know a thing about the gliders,''
says Bard Coatsworth of Lincoln, a former state commander of the
National World War II Glider Pilots Association.
   ``I decided it's time that we stop sitting around telling old
war stories and let the world know about the contribution of
gliders to the war effort.''
   Gliders owe their military history to the Germans, who were
banned as part of the Versailles Treaty from manufacturing aircraft
with engines, Coatsworth said.
   ``They used them to fly demolition experts across the lines into
France at night to destroy the pillboxes and guardposts.''
   Coatsworth was working at the Lincoln Aviation Institute _ the
same place Charles Lindbergh learned to fly _ when he heard the
Army was looking for experienced pilots for glider training.
   He signed up in July 1942 and wound up at Ong Flying School in
Goodland, Kan., where he got 25 hours of training, landing without
power from various altitudes, day and night.
   From there, it was on to two air bases in Texas and more night
and day dead-stick flying, with some practice in gliders made from
converted power aircraft.
   He got his first glimpse of the Waco CG4A (C for combat, G for
glider) in Lubbock, Texas, and remembers wondering, ``How could
anybody fly a thing like this.''
   The gilder, with a wingspan of 83 feet, 8 inches, an overall
length of 48 feet, 3} inches, and a height of 12 feet and 7-odd
inches, ``looked like a big olive green bomber,'' he says.
   It wasn't designed to be pretty.
   ``It was an aerial truck,'' Coatsworth says, ``but the power
pilots who criticized it didn't know what they were missing. It
handled like a dream.''
   Although the war ended before Coatsworth had to fly a glider in
combat, he did have some rather harrowing experiences during
training.
   Once the tow rope broke loose from the power aircraft pulling
the glider and narrowly missed breaking the windshield of the
glider. The rope became tangled around the landing gear and
Coatsworth had to maneuver the craft through a clearing in some
trees to land.
   Snagging the rope would have resulted in a crash, he said.
   On a night run, Coatsworth and his co-pilot had to cut free
because they were incorrectly signaled that the tow plane was in
trouble. Coatsworth and his co-pilot had a choice of landing on a
highway with traffic or at a rock quarry.
   ``We set it down about 20 feet short of the edge of the quarry,
in snake-infested country,'' he says. ``We spent the night on the
wing until they found us in the morning.''
   Coatsworth, assigned to the 66th Squadron of the 403rd Troop
Carrier Group, said the CG4A could carry 13 soldiers and a crew of
two. Some carried mini-bulldozers, Jeeps or mortars.
   The gliders were first used in the war on July 9, 1943, when
they carried British airborne troops from an airfield in Tunisia to
Axis-held Sicily.
   In February 1944, gliders carried troops and equipment behind
enemy lines in Burma to set up landing areas to be used in a
massive air assault that surprised the Japanese.
   Gliders played a key role in the D-day invasion of Normandy on
June 6, 1944, and saw action in southern France, Holland, Bastogne
and Varsity.
   ``They were slated to join forces for a final airborne assault
on Japan proper, but we dropped the big one before it came to
that,'' Coatsworth says.
   Coatsworth says the National World War II Glider Pilots
Association, formed in 1971, has about 1,300 members. He estimates
there were probably 10,000 men trained to fly gliders.
   The association was instrumental in establishing a Silent Wings
Museum in Terrell, Texas, near Dallas, where people can view one of
several restored CG4A gliders and other memorabilia.
   ``My big concern now is that we get our proper place in
history,'' Coatsworth says.
   ``All the other services _ the paratroopers, the PT boat crews,
and the like _ have gotten theirs, and I don't deny them that. But
it's time now for the country to recognize the glider pilots.''
