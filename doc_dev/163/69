<LEADPARA>  Pan American World Airways, the nation's once-mighty pioneer of international
aviation, shut down operations Wednesday and grounded its aircraft after
failing to raise badly needed cash to keep flying.;   The abrupt shutdown put
10,000 Pan Am employees out of work and forced thousands of ticket holders to
scramble for seats on other carriers. Several airlines agreed to honor Pan Am
tickets, and other carriers applied to temporarily take over Pan Am's
remaining routes.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Pan Am became the third major U.S. airline -- after Eastern and Midway --
to fold this year and the most visible result of the continuing concentration
of the U.S. industry. Wall Street analysts expect the airline consolidation
process, spawned by deregulation of the industry in 1979 and accelerated by
the recession, to end with only five or six major carriers in a year or two.; 
 Pan Am had battled huge losses since the 1980s and filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in January.;   The closure came one day after Delta Air
Lines stunned Pan Am by backing out of a deal to help the carrier emerge from
bankruptcy court. A much smaller Pan Am would have kept flying primarily to
Latin America under the joint ownership of creditors and Delta Air Lines.;  
But the reorganization plan fell apart late Tuesday after Delta refused to put
up more cash to keep Pan Am operating. Pan Am was losing an estimated $3
million a day, according to industry sources.;   Delta, which had purchased
most of Pan Am's international routes in October and would have owned 45
percent of a reorganized Pan Am, had pumped more than $100 million into Pan Am
before it balked at speeding up payments.;   Delta said it had no choice.
Officials of the Atlanta-based airline said it soon became evident -- based on
deteriorating passenger traffic and ticket sales -- that Pan Am would not be
able to make it even as a much smaller carrier.;   Analysts said the biggest
winner to result from the shutdown is American Airlines. On routes to Latin
America, Pan Am was the only major challenger to American, which has
established a dominant presence in Miami.;   American, United and Delta
airlines have come through the industry shake-up stronger than ever. According
to the magazine Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, their share of the U.S.
market grew from 46.8 percent in August 1990 to 53 percent in August 1991.;  
Pan Am ushered in international air travel in the 1930s, with many of its
early routes scouted by legendary pilot Charles Lindbergh. The carrier
launched such concepts as first-class service and in-flight movies.; PAN AM
