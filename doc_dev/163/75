AIRPORT SOLUTION

<P>
Your editorial ("Lindbergh Needs a Short-Term Fix," Aug. 26) is right on target 
in suggesting that making plans to expand Lindbergh Field to 24 million people 
would derail the effort to relocate our commercial airport. Nothing derails 
faster than a complex political solution effort. 
</P>
<P>
Too many of today's leaders are falling victim to the same old obstacles that 
have prevented an airport solution for 40 years. We need some vision in this 
city of ours. Although the majority of the City Council voted to expand 
Lindbergh, that doesn't change the fact that Lindbergh can't cut it as a 21st 
Century airport. No consultant has been able to craft a plan that will 
adequately deal with capacity, safety, and noise issues at Lindbergh, because 
it cannot be done. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for us to recognize that Sandag's recommendation for a binational 
airport is a good one and should be seized upon by our community. Not only can 
a binational airport meet the criteria for capacity, safety, and noise 
requirements, but it has the potential to help our two countries better deal 
with existing border related problems. 
</P>
<P>
We can start to build a solid consensus by demonstrating to the Mexican 
government the mutual benefits to be derived by both countries, and reject 
short-term agendas of politicians who are currently trying to derail their own 
regional council of governments' wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to you, L.A. Times, for staying on track and trying to convince our 
elected officials to do likewise. And thanks also to members of Sandag's 
committee who have met with officials in Washington, D.C., and will soon meet 
with representatives of Mexico. Thanks for not turning your backs on San Diego 
and showing courage and vision in your pursuit of the airport answer. We're 
glad you can all see beyond the year 2000.
