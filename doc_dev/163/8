   Eleven-year-old pilot Chris Marshall took off
from New York Saturday on a trip to Europe, just like his hero,
Charles Lindbergh _ but with a few stops and a grown-up co-pilot.
   Bad weather and a thorough mechanical inspection of his Mooney
252 two-seater delayed the takeoff from La Guardia Airport until 5
p.m.
   ``I want to show all the kids in North America that if I can do
this trip, then they can achieve their dreams too,'' Chris said
after arriving at his first stop along the way, Montreal.
   He arrived in New York on Friday evening after a disconcerting
moment when the electrical system shut down for 10 seconds during
his approach.
   Chris landed safely, though, and all systems were go Saturday _
onboard video cameras were suspected of having drained the
batteries on Friday.
   Chris, of Oceano, Calif., has flown from San Diego to Texas to
St. Louis to New York. He plans stops in Montreal, Greenland and
Iceland on his way to Paris.
   Though space was at a premium because of emergency gear required
for flights over the North Atlantic, Chris made room for his
stuffed bear, outfitted with goggles, named ``Charles Lindbeargh.''
   The fifth-grader, the son of a commercial pilot, is also
accompanied by Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, 46, a retired Miramar
Naval Air Station, Calif., commander and pilot in the Vietnam War.
   Cunningham sits in the pilot's seat in the two-seat craft.
Chris' seat is boosted to window-level by a foam cushion. But Chris
has done all of the flying, Cunningham said. The boy's flight time
is limited to less than eight hours at a stretch.
   Chris first took the controls of a plane at age 4, and began
flying with an instructor at age 7.
   Last year, he became the youngest flier to cross the United
States. Tony Aliengena, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., broke the record in April by making a
California-Massachusetts round trip.
   Chris said this trip would make him the world's youngest
transatlantic pilot.
   Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York
City before completing his history-making solo flight across the
Atlantic Ocean to Paris in 1927. The non-stop flight took 33{ hours.
