The San Diego City Council Tuesday approved construction of a 10-story office 
building 80 feet north of the approach corridor to Lindbergh Field -- after the 
developer agreed to trim the height of the building by 39 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed office tower, which in the past has aroused concerns over safety 
from the Air Line Pilots Assn. and the San Diego Unified Port District, will be 
130 feet tall under a compromise between the city and the developer approved in 
a 7-0 vote. Its final design must be approved by City Architect Michael 
Stepner. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots association and the Port District have dropped their objections to 
Cheng Development's plans for the 336,102-square-foot office tower on the block 
bounded by 4th and 5th avenues and Kalmia and Laurel streets, which was 
repeatedly approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to a 
Planning Department report and Councilman Bob Filner. 
</P>

<P>
Company Protests 
</P>
<P>
The proposal did, however, bring objections from Vincent Bartolotta, attorney 
for Alesio Investment Co., which owns the adjacent 5th Avenue Financial Center 
that houses Mr. A's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Bartolotta told the council Tuesday that the new structure will pose a hazard 
to both commercial and private aircraft by adding to the terrain another 
high-rise structure that cuts into pilots' safety margin. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern isn't just with the height of the building, it's with the lateral 
side movement," Bartolotta said. "It wouldn't take something as big as what 
flies in and out of (Lindbergh) to eat up 80 feet in a minute." 
</P>
<P>
Bartolotta said private pilots who bank around the east and west sides of his 
building may strike the new structure, particularly in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Discounted 
</P>
<P>
But David Mulliken, an attorney for Cheng Development, said that, although the 
building will be 80 feet from the edge of the approach corridor, it is 1,580 
feet from the center line used by commercial pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Private pilots fly above all the multistory commercial and residential 
buildings in the area, and could not hit the Cheng office tower without first 
slamming into existing residential structures of similar height east and south 
of the proposed building, Mulliken said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"To stand up here and say safety is still an issue is just flat irresponsible," 
Mulliken said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA ruled in March that the building, then proposed for 190 feet, would not 
pose a hazard. But, when the pilots association and the Port District appealed 
that decision, the FAA told Cheng to remove decorative spires planned for the 
top of the structure and again ruled that the building is not a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots association again appealed but later withdrew its objection. The 
Port District withdrew its opposition on the condition that the building be 
trimmed to 130 feet, Filner said.
