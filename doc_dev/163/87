<LEADPARA>  CHARLES Lindbergh made a solo airplane flight across the Atlantic in 1927, but
it took 57 more years for someone to do the flight in a balloon. On Sept. 14,
1984, Joe W. Kittinger lifted off from Caribou, Maine, and four days later he
crash landed in bad weather near Savone, Italy.;   Making a balloon fly seems
so simple compared with the complexities and precision of airplane engines and
airframes. Yet it is these simple principles of flight that make long-distance
travel in a balloon so difficult -- and so alluring at the same time.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     We and our children may never get to fly in a balloon, but we can take our
own flights of fancy, and our imaginary trips will become much more vivid and
much more meaningful if we understand what actually happens, and why it
happens, when a hot-air balloon lifts majestically away from the Earth and
sails over the countryside.;   One of the basic scientific principles that
children of all ages should understand is that hot air rises and cold air
falls. Hot air is lighter than cold air because heat excites the molecules in
the air (oxygen and nitrogen) and drives them apart.;   CONSEQUENTLY, a gallon
of warm air would contain fewer molecules than a gallon of colder air, and
therefore would weigh less than the gallon of colder air.;   Now the beginning
of our imaginary flight occurs near dawn, when the air outside the balloon is
cool and the winds are light. The propane burner in our wicker gondola roars
and heats the air trapped in the balloon until that air expands and expands
even more. Soon the combined weight of the hot air, the balloon, the gondola
and everything in it, including us, is less than the weight of the same volume
of outside air.;   We lift gently off the ground as friends below wave, wish
us well, and become smaller and smaller, almost invisible now, though we can
still hear their conversations (between blasts from the burner) because the
Earth bounces their voices up to us as we stand in absolute silence and
peacefulness in our basket above.;   A gust of wind carries us away from our
launch site, and we sail over houses and trees and farmlands. Is our hair
blowing in the stiff breeze? No, we feel no wind at all because we are the
wind! We are being carried by the wind; we are going just as fast as the wind,
and so to us the air always feels calm.;   CAN WE turn back toward our launch
site? No, we are prisoners of the wind that carries us where it will. We can
climb and descend with our burner, but we have no control over our direction.
Our friends will have to follow us with a truck in order to get the balloon
and gondola back home.;   Now the day heats up, and as we fly at tree-top
level above a hot, blacktop parking lot, does our balloon rise or drop?
Surprisingly enough, it is sucked downward because the hot air from the
parking lot is not much different in temperature from the air in our balloon.;
  Soon we pass above a cool, wet marsh. Do we rise or drop?;   It's getting
late now, and we'll need time for our crew to find us and get everything
loaded into the truck before dark. There's a meadow straight ahead, if we can
just clear those telephone wires. A few blasts from the burner slow our
descent, and soon we bounce and skid across the meadow to a stop.;   Want to
go again? Well, that's one advantage our imaginary flights have over the real
thing.  </TEXT>
