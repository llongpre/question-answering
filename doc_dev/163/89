The City Council on Monday formally voted to ask the Port District to study the 
feasibility of relocating air cargo business from busy Lindbergh Field to 
city-owned Brown Field on Otay Mesa.

<P>
The council, acting on a recommendation of one of its committees, wants the San 
Diego Unified Port District, which operates Lindbergh Field, to find out if
