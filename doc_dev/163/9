   An 11-year-old California boy today
became the youngest pilot to cross the Atlantic, landing at the
Paris airport where Charles Lindbergh completed a historic solo
crossing in 1927.
   Christopher Lee Marshall touched down his single-engine plane at
Le Bourget airport on a flight from Glasgow, Scotland, where he
spent the night.
   The boy aviator was greeted by his mother as he stepped from the
plane wearing a bright blue flight suit and a baseball cap with a
sign reading ``Chris Marshall Tour.''
   ``We're finally here. We made it,'' he said, grinning ear-to-ear
but looking tired.
   ``Mommy missed you so much. Give me a kiss,'' said his mother,
Gail Marshall, who waved an American flag and clutched a stuffed
bear intended as a present for her son.
   The young aviator from Oceano, Calif., then kissed his mother.
   Christopher started his flight in San Diego on July 7. He was
accompanied by retired Navy pilot Randy Cunningham, 46, who limited
Marshall's flying time to eight-hour stretches.
   A champagne and cola reception was held in the hangar of the
airport, north of Paris.
   Despite the trans-Atlantic venture, which included stops in St.
Louis, New York, Montreal, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland,
Christopher revealed his youth.
   On stepping from the plane, his first words to his mother were:
``I have to go to the toilet.'' He disappeared briefly then
returned to pose for photographers.
   At one point, Christopher re-entered the aircraft to produce his
old stuffed bear, from which he has said he is inseparable.
Photographers snapped pictures of Christopher with the cuddly
animal in its goggles and helmet and bearing a sign with its name
``Charles Lindbeargh.''
   Christopher arrived in Glasgow Wednesday night after an 840-mile
flight from Reykjavik, Iceland in his single-engine Mooney 252
aircraft.
   He arrived in Reykjavik early Wednesday after flying about 450
miles from Kulusuk on Greenland's southeast coast in 2 hours 15
minutes.
   The arrival in Paris was delayed by one day due to engine
troubles Wednesday that forced the plane back to Greenland.
   Cunningham said he took over the controls to fly the plane 50
miles back to Greenland after engine trouble and bad weather with
low visibility made the situation critical.
   He said it was the only time during the flight that he took
control of the aircraft.
   Cunningham said he had trouble finding the air field at Kukusuk,
an island of Greenland's southeast coast: ``We would have had to
ditch at sea. I didn't think I was going to live.''
   The oil filter cap had rattled loose so the oil pressure
plummeted and the engine overheated.
   Christopher's mother said her son began flying with his father
at the age of 4 and began training with an instructor at age 7.
   She said she was worried by the problems Wednesday.
   ``If I knew, I don't think I would have let him go,'' she said.
