   Walter Ballard, who piloted the plane
that carried the nation's first load of transcontinental airmail in
1932, died at home after a lengthy illness. He was 93.
   Ballard was a pilot for American Airways, now American Airlines,
when he flew the first hop from San Diego's Lindbergh Field to
Phoenix, Ariz., on the transcontinental mail flight, according to
Edwin McKellar, executive director of the San Diego Aerospace
Museum.
   Ballard, who died Sunday, learned to fly during World War I and
was a test pilot during World War II, leaving the Navy with the
rank of lieutenant commander, McKellar said.
   He also engaged in cross-country racing, precision aerobatics,
dogfighting and test piloting. He logged more than three million
air miles and 20,000 flying hours in 25 different types of planes.
   ``Walter was a slice of early aviation history,'' said McKellar.
``He will be greatly missed at the museum, where he spent many
hours and years helping to restore planes in our collection.''
   Ballard was a volunteer at the San Diego Aerospace Museum until
a few months before his death.
   Among the planes he helped restore was a 1917 Curtiss JN4-D
``Jenny,'' in which Ballard learned to fly during World War I. The
war ended just as he finished training.
   ``We put in 10 hours a day ... learning almost everything there
was to know about airplanes,'' he said a few years ago. ``It didn't
seem right to let all that training go to waste.''
   He is survived by his wife, Susan.
