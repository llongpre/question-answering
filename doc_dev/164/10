<LEADPARA>  For those needing an early jump on their New Year's Day plans, the options may
include watching Cal's football team.;   The Bears, for now, are being watched
by executives from the upper tier of Jan. 1 games -- the Fiesta, Orange,
Florida Citrus and Sugar bowls -- with executives of less prestigious games --
the Hall of Fame is one -- ready to step in if the bigger bowls lose interest.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Granted, the distinction of playing on New Year's Day has lost some of its
luster with eight -- yes, eight -- bowl games on the day's schedule. So to say
Cal could be playing in a New Year's Day bowl game, as Brent Musburger did
during Cal's 24-17 loss to Washington, still begs for some narrowing of the
scope.;   The only way to glean a Rose Bowl invitation, of course, is to win
the Pacific 10 Conference championship, which appears headed for Washington.; 
 The Orange also could take some work, because its selection committee uses
three criteria -- national ranking, television audience and fan support -- to
choose an at-large opponent for the Big Eight champion. The Bears were on last
week's Orange Bowl list of 16 and made this week's cut to 12.;   But Cal would
have to be ranked very high -- probably meaning the top three or four -- to
offset questions about its fan base and television appeal, an Orange Bowl
representative said. A group of 7,500 Cal fans traveled to Tucson, Ariz., for
last year's Copper Bowl, a Cal spokesman said.;   If Cal can avoid losing
before Nov. 17, the day bowl bids are delivered, the Bears could net games as
lucrative as the Sugar Bowl, which offers $3.365 million to each team, or the
Fiesta Bowl, which has a $2 million payout. The bid date means the Bears' bowl
hopes should be decided before the Stanford game.;   "We would consider a team
that finished tied for the league championship or lost competitively to the
top team and finished 10-1, depending on how the other bowl possibilities
would be," Fiesta representative Wayne Goodrich said. "We have roots in the
Pac-10. A school like Cal would have a presence on the day of our game.";  
Said Troy Mathieu, assistant executive director of the Sugar Bowl: "At this
point it's very early, but we are interested in the Pac-10 runner-up. . . .
Our game follows the Rose Bowl on ABC, (so) having a Pac-10 team in a bowl
game keeps the fans tuned in. But it's still early.";   The Citrus Bowl has a
soft spot for "Cinderella" teams such as Cal, Citrus president Bob Moore said,
but there's concern about how many Bears fans would go to Orlando, Fla., to
attend the game. The crowd enthusiasm against Washington helped allay that
worry, particularly with a Citrus Bowl representative in attendance, but the
Citrus committee also will look at how many fans go to Cal's Pac-10 games on
the road.;   It's too early for the Hall of Fame Bowl to put together a list,
said Jim McVay, the bowl's executive director, but Cal certainly has his
attention.;   "There are a lot of pluses," McVay said. "Great players, good
reputation, hell of a team. There aren't any negatives."; CAL'S NEW YEAR'S DAY
