SCHEMBECHLER COULD USE LAST LAUGH AGAINST USC

<P>
Whenever Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler is reminded of his 1-7 record in the 
Rose Bowl, which is often, he jokes about it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a logical response, because he can't do anything now about what has 
happened in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his lighthearted comments, Schembechler would like to start 
chipping away at his record by beating USC today in the 75th renewal of the 
Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith doesn't have such skeletons rattling in his coaching 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there is a certain urgency for Smith to win today's game, 
considering that his Trojans lost to Michigan State in last year's Rose Bowl 
game in his first appearance as a head coach. It would also take some of the 
sting out of a regular-season ending loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
That defeat ranks as one of the most disappointing in 100 years of USC 
football. If USC (10-1) had won, it would be defending a No. 1 ranking in 
college football against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback Rodney Peete has said that it will be a long time before that 
defeat is little more than a memory. 
</P>
<P>
So how will the Trojans respond? Smith isn't sure. "We won't know until we come 
out on the field. We haven't been able to judge ourselves in that situation 
because it's the first time we've come off a loss this season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Michigan (8-2-1), the Wolverines could be a national championship 
contender today if it weren't for early season losses to Notre Dame and Miami 
by a total of 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written that the USC-Michigan matchup is a secondary bowl game, 
inasmuch as No. 1-ranked Notre Dame and No. 3 West Virginia will be playing for 
the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Schembechler and Smith contend that the "Granddaddy of them 
all," the Rose Bowl, doesn't take a back seat in viewing interest to any bowl. 
Subsequent television ratings will provide more insight. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, today's Rose Bowl game has its intrinsic interest -- 
Schembechler's albatross-like record along with the Big Ten's failure here in 
recent years, losing 12 of the past 14 Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there's the relationship between the coaches. Smith got his coaching 
start as a member of Schembechler's staff at Miami of Ohio and Michigan in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
They've been friends ever since, and Smith attributes much of his coaching 
philosophy to his early apprenticeship under Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has lost only 5 games and won 18 in 2 seasons at USC. In those losses, 
Trojan turnovers were decisive. Smith says they will be a key factor today. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan isn't likely to oblige, considering that quarterbacks Michael Taylor 
and Demetrius Brown have thrown only 2 interceptions and have lost only 8 
fumbles the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
With the notable exception of the Notre Dame game when USC had 4 turnovers, the 
Trojans haven't been error-prone. 
</P>
<P>
Peete has thrown 10 interceptions, but that's misleading, considering his 
entire offensive output. He has completed 208 of 338 passes (61.5%) for an 
average of 241.3 yards a game and 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Michigan's quarterbacks have attempted only 191 passes. The 
Wolverines are primarily a running team, featuring tailback Tony Boles and 
fullback Leroy Hoard, who are each averaging 5.5 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
"Michigan will not be taken out of its running game," Smith said. "They're 
better at it than any team we've played." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Wolverines may be forced to pass more often than in previous games 
considering the Trojans are No. 2-ranked nationally in rushing defense, 
allowing an average of only 76.6 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
USC has a more balanced offense, averaging 214.6 yards running and 247 yards 
passing compared with 256.6 and 153.4 for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have what Smith calls bend-but-not-break defenses. Michigan features 
one of the nation's best defensive linemen in tackle Mark Messner. 
</P>
<P>
However, Peete, who placed second to Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders in the 
Heisman Trophy voting, seemingly provides USC with an edge in an otherwise even 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Brown became the starting quarterback when Taylor suffered a broken collarbone 
in the ninth game of the season against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Brown had 16 interceptions last season, a factor in losing his starting job to 
Taylor. However, he hasn't been intercepted since replacing Taylor, completing 
61.7% of his passes for 5 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It's Brown's show today as Taylor was recently hospitalized with the flu and 
isn't expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines are aware of Peete's capabilities. Said Messner: "He's very, 
very fast and he can beat you single-handedly." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had some success blitzing Peete in a 27-10 victory, and it wouldn't 
be surprising if Michigan uses the same tactic. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines don't seem to be up-tight, perhaps reflecting the mood of their 
coach, who has been accommodating and apparently relaxed since the team's 
arrival here. 
</P>
<P>
As for his 1-7 Rose Bowl record, Schembechler, who has won more games than any 
other active college coach, dismisses it by saying: 
</P>
<P>
"If you win all the time, maybe you don't have as much appreciation for it. The 
thing that has balanced out my career is the fact I haven't been as successful 
in bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the same record I had in bowls as I do in the regular season, I'd 
probably be too cocky and have too big an ego." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kickoff for today's game is 2 p.m. A crowd of 95,000 to 100,000 is expected. . 
. . USC is a 6 1/2-point favorite. Even though Aaron Emanuel has been USC's 
most productive tailback in recent games, Coach Larry Smith said that Ricky 
Ervins would start today. "He has had excellent practices," Smith said of 
Ervins, "but all of our tailbacks will play." He was mainly referring to 
Ervins, Emanuel and Scott Lockwood. Smith would also like to use Steven Webster 
if possible. Webster, a senior, has missed virtually the entire season with 
injuries. . . . Michigan's Wilbur Odom, a sophomore, who has played in only one 
game, will back up Demetrius Brown at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
USC is ranked fifth in the polls, Michigan 11th. . . . Smith concedes that 
Michigan has an edge over USC in the kicking game. Mike Gillette, a catcher on 
the baseball team, is averaging 40.4 yards on punts. He set a school record 
with his 56-yard field goal against Ohio State. USC punter Chris Sperle is 
averaging 38.3 yards, and Quin Rodriguez made 14 of 19 field goals, 7 for 7 
inside the 30-yard line. . . . Erik Affholter, USC's All-American split end, 
set schools records in the regular season for receptions in a season (63) and 
career (118). Michigan has accomplished wide receivers in Greg McMurtry, Chris 
Calloway and John Kolesar. However, that group has had a total of only 67 
receptions on a run-oriented team. 
</P>
<P>
T.J. Osman, Michigan's middle guard, on Bo Schembechler's overall 4-11 bowl 
record: "He told us before we left that if we got a question about his bowl 
record to answer by saying that it's his record and not anything that we had to 
do with." . . . Asked to comment on Michigan allowing 31 points against Ohio 
State in the second half of a final regular-season game, defensive tackle Mark 
Messner said: "We're still asking what happened. We had the same players and we 
were calling the same defenses, but they were going right through us." Michigan 
won, though, 34-31, on a late, 41-yard pass from Brown to Kolesar. Michigan is 
ranked ninth nationally in scoring defense, allowing an average of 13.9 points 
a game. . . . USC has a 3-1 record against Michigan in the Rose Bowl and 3-3 
overall. The Trojans have an 18-7 Rose Bowl record. . . . Schembechler has lost 
only one Rose Bowl game by more than 8 points, a 24-14 loss to UCLA in 1983.
