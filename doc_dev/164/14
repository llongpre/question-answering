Those who administer college football are depressed. They aren't able to 
understand the money madness seizing the children who play the game. 
</P>
<P>
With eligibility left, the kids are going over the wall to join the pros. What 
has happened to the student-athlete? You ask one: 
</P>
<P>
"Are you interested in engineering?" 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed I am. I am dying to study the power plant of a Ferrari -- my Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that undergraduates in football don't have the healthy 
outlook of their university elders, who see the game as simple beauty, free 
from commercial pressure and general money-grubbing. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, colleges today play no more than 12 games. They are playing bowl 
games before the season even starts -- things called the Kickoff Classic and 
Disneyland Pigskin Classic. 
</P>
<P>
A college distinguished for its football has set up a private television deal 
with NBC. Lesser arrangements by universities result in as many as 11 games 
being seen on TV on a single Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Why can't the players comport themselves like those who run college football, 
detached from earthly goods, dedicated to the spirit of friendly rivalry that 
sportsmen seek? 
</P>
<P>
New Year's Day, you will see that the number of bowl games on television has 
been limited to eight. 
</P>
<P>
"You will note the restraint," university people will tell players thinking of 
jumping to the pros. "We easily could play 10 on New Year's, scheduling two 
games between midnight and 6 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, college football favored us with four bowls on Jan. 1 -- Rose, 
Orange, Cotton and Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
It expanded to five with something known as the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl. Then, 
presumably on a leveraged buyout, the Florida Citrus Bowl took over the 
Tangerine Bowl and soon bumped New Year's Day viewing to six games. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame Bowl increased it to seven, the figure now escalating to eight 
with a switching of dates of the Mazda Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Eight bowl games battling each other on the same day might appear as overkill, 
but what's a little cannibalization among educated people? 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Cotton Bowl has come to be called the Mobil Cotton Bowl and the 
Sugar Bowl the USF&amp;G Sugar Bowl. The Sun Bowl became the John Hancock Sun 
Bowl, until such time as the sponsor decided such billing was a deterrent to 
direct communication. 
</P>
<P>
The name was changed to John Hancock Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And the universities, observing events, go along, because they are not as 
commercially oriented as today's players. 
</P>
<P>
Over in Tucson, they got a postseason game certified known as the Copper Bowl. 
Linking up with a firm that makes mouth freshener, the game became known as the 
Copper BreathLess Bowl, but that would change to Copper Bowl, presented by 
BreathLess. 
</P>
<P>
Last heard from, the game was still breathing, but without its mouth-freshening 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, this is watched unblinkingly by the colleges, role models for those 
student-athletes who would dump their schools for a lousy $80,000 a year from 
the pros. 
</P>
<P>
Since only one bowl game, the Rose, has fixed participants every year, the 
others must hoof it, entering into bloodlettings to beat out rivals for the 
best teams. 
</P>
<P>
Rules prevent bowls from contacting teams before specified dates, and, of 
course, no school would fudge, accepting bids prematurely, because this would 
set a bum example for the players. 
</P>
<P>
Watching a school that lacks integrity, a player with eligibility might be 
tempted to talk to a pro team in the alley about the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Now, say, you play for Clemson where home sellouts are automatic. Why open with 
Miami when you can play Cal State Long Beach? 
</P>
<P>
Same financial result. 
</P>
<P>
So you wipe out Long Beach, 59-0, enhance the winning record and prepare three 
weeks down the line to entertain Appalachian State. Picturing George Allen, 
Long Beach coach, on the sideline last Saturday, you heard him mumble: "The 
future is 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
But Clemson establishes standards any admiring kid will want to emulate as he 
strolls the boulevard of life.
