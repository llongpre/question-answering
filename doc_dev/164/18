SCHEMBECHLER TO QUIT AS COACH AFTER ROSE BOWL;

Bo Schembechler, big-time college football's winningest active coach, will step 
down for medical reasons after Michigan plays USC in the Rose Bowl, sources 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, 60, will turn the Wolverines' program over to assistant Gary 
Moeller. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler will remain as Michigan's athletic director, a post that was added 
to his title in 1988 after Don Canham reached the mandatory retirement age of 
70, said the sources, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler was out of his office early today. He was to meet with his players 
in the afternoon. A news conference was scheduled for 5 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler told a university sociology class Monday that he would never sit 
in the coach's office of the $12.5-million Center of Champions. The building, 
to be completed next autumn, will house the football program. 
</P>
<P>
He also told the students that Moeller would be the next coach. 
</P>
<P>
Heart attacks in 1970 and 1987 resulted in open-heart surgery, and 
Schembechler's physicians have urged him to slow down ever since. The decision 
was made easier because the Michigan football program is riding the crest of 
two consecutive Big Ten championships. 
</P>
<P>
It also was becoming necessary because Associate Athletic Director Jack 
Weidenbach, who has been in charge of daily operations of the department while 
Schembechler tended to football duties, is nearing retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Schembechler said he decided to make the announcement now 
because he wants prospective recruits to know who the coach will be. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler leads all coaches in NCAA Division I-A with a record of 234-64-8 
after 21 years at Michigan and six at Miami of Ohio. He is fifth on the 
all-time list and needs only four more victories to match his mentor at Ohio 
State, Woody Hayes. Schembechler is the winningest coach in Michigan history at 
194-47-5. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler never has had a losing season. Fifteen of his 21 Michigan teams 
have been ranked in the top 10 nationally. The 1985 team finished No. 2 after 
beating Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The only honor that has eluded Schembechler is the mythical national 
championship. The Wolverines began the 1989 season ranked No. 1 but lost their 
opening game to Notre Dame before reeling off 10 straight wins. They are ranked 
No. 3 and have only a slim chance of slipping past Colorado and Miami in the 
final Associated Press poll after the bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think that my career has been a failure because I have never won a 
national title, you have another think coming," Schembechler said a few days 
before beating Ohio State in the final regular-season game this season. "I have 
never played a game for the national title. Our goals always have been to win 
the Big Ten title and the Rose Bowl. If we do that, then we consider it a 
successful season." 
</P>
<P>
The New Year's Day game against USC will be Schembechler's 10th Rose Bowl and 
third in the last four years. The Wolverines (10-1) earned their second 
consecutive Big Ten title this season and 13th in Schembechler's career. 
</P>
<P>
Moeller, 48, has been an assistant to Schembechler for 18 years. He rejoined 
the Wolverines' staff in 1980 after three years as coach at Illinois, where he 
was released after compiling a 6-24-3 record.
