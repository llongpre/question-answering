MELVIN DURSLAG: A CRAZY EIGHT IS TOO MUCH FOR ONE TV SCREEN;

Inspecting the bowl football program on New Year's Day, you have a vision of 
herring in a net, flopping over one another. 
</P>
<P>
The current lineup embraces eight games, running from 8:30 in the morning (PST) 
until roughly 8:30 at night. 
</P>
<P>
You are surprised the genii of college football have stopped at eight games. 
Between midnight and 8 a.m., they could book two more. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, they could squeeze in another in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, they have arranged so many games Jan. 1 that an overlap occurs. For 
instance, the Citrus Bowl, the Cotton Bowl and the Hall of Fame Bowl poach on 
each other's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
And all three arrive on the air at some time during the second half of the 
Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Bowl and the Sugar Bowl overlap, same as the Fiesta Bowl and the 
Rose Bowl. And all are coming off a previous day of activity featuring the John 
Hancock Bowl and the Domino's Pizza Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
A confused viewer of those two could leave his set believing he will be insured 
in 30 minutes, or the policy is free. 
</P>
<P>
You are a tolerant individual. You are patient and understanding, the milk of 
human kindness flowing by the liter through every vein. 
</P>
<P>
You are not aiming to rock the vessel. All you are trying to comprehend is 
whether college football has gone foaming-at-the-mouth mad. 
</P>
<P>
One isn't supposed to be dealing here with dummies. This is our highest 
intellectual order, the teachers of our young. 
</P>
<P>
And they allow a circumstance on New Year's Day calling for eight televised 
bowl games? 
</P>
<P>
If smart guys permit this excess, what would imbeciles do? 
</P>
<P>
So what has all this done to that spectacle billing itself as "the Granddaddy 
of 'Em All," the Rose Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
What it has done is reduce the Rose Bowl to selling nothing but age -- a game 
beginning in 1902 and continuing to the present, with intermittent stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1902 game, for instance, it stopped until 1916, substituting that 
well-known ghetto sport, polo. It also tried chariot races. 
</P>
<P>
And then the Rose Bowl ground to a halt in Pasadena in 1942 when the game was 
shifted to Durham, N.C. It was a war year, and Pasadena feared an air attack by 
the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
What an insult to the Luftwaffe to OK the game on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was once the premier postseason game, the Rose Bowl has suffered 
serious slippage, not at the box office, but in the television ratings and in 
general prestige. 
</P>
<P>
And the ultimate contempt has been the willingness of other bowls to go 
head-and-head with it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Offering Washington and Iowa this time, the Rose Bowl needn't necessarily 
apologize. Washington, on a good day, can knock off any amateur team in the 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
And Iowa is better than average. 
</P>
<P>
But it has become increasingly rare that connoisseurs about the land judge the 
Rose Bowl as an event of major national impact. It is more a parochial little 
war between the Pacific 10 and the Big Ten, pretty much like Eton and Harrow. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Rose Bowl still dredges more money from television than any other 
bowl game -- that could be a fleeting condition -- it behooves the promoters 
each year to capture participants of muscle, teams with substantial followings. 
</P>
<P>
Those teams preferred are USC, UCLA, Michigan and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and Iowa are rated fair. What ABC lives in fear of is, say, Oregon 
State vs. Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Bucking seven other games New Year's Day, with such a matchup the network 
starts looking for a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
One is available in Pasadena, making the Rose Bowl a game of convenience, if 
nothing else.
