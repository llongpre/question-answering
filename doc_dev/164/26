Colorado could simplify the voting process in the final Associated Press and 
United Press International college football polls by beating Notre Dame Monday 
night in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes, the current No. 1-ranked team, would remain unbeaten, and who 
really cares which teams finish second through fourth in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
All remaining contenders -- Miami, Michigan and Notre Dame -- would have at 
least one loss. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Notre Dame beats Colorado, Miami beats Alabama in the Sugar Bowl 
and Michigan beats USC in the Rose Bowl, the voting could become more 
subjective. 
</P>
<P>
In that event, it would seem logical to elevate Miami, now ranked No. 2, to the 
top spot, considering that it already had beaten Notre Dame, which had disposed 
of the current No. 1 team, Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
However, Notre Dame, now No. 4, which has a strong national following, may get 
some support from reporters (Associated Press) and coaches (United Press 
International) for the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
There also could be voting backlash against Miami for reasons that have nothing 
to do with results. The Hurricanes, with their swaggering and finger-pointing 
on the field and previous "convict" image, may be a distasteful choice for the 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Voters might be looking for any excuse not to promote Miami to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of Notre Dame's popularity was evident in a recent USA Today 
phone-in poll. Answering the question of who is the nation's No. 1 team, 1,063 
voted for Notre Dame, 611 for Michigan, 498 for Miami and only 443 for 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler says it's "a shot in the dark" for his team to 
get the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
However, considering that Schembechler is retiring after the Rose Bowl game and 
that he has never won a national championship in his 21 years as the 
Wolverines' coach despite an impressive record, he and his Michigan team could 
be a sentimental choice to jump from No. 3 to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
That seems unlikely, though, because Notre Dame beat Michigan in a 
season-opening game. 
</P>
<P>
In tiebreakers for conference championships, head-to-head results are the 
determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
That is not necessarily a guideline for the voting in the wire service polls. 
</P>
<P>
Take 1978, for example. USC beat Alabama, 24-14, in the third game of the 
season and then later lost to Arizona State. Alabama didn't lose another game, 
and neither did USC. 
</P>
<P>
Since USC beat Alabama, there was an obvious tiebreaker in the voting for No. 
1. However, the AP poll selected Alabama as national champion. The UPI poll 
tabbed USC as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the possibility that there could be split national champions again 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, the UPI poll has not recognized teams that are on NCAA probation. 
The AP poll doesn't make such a distinction. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, USC was designated national champion by UPI at the end of the season. 
Oklahoma, which was on probation, was AP's national champion. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it isn't a perfect system but one that could be settled by playoffs 
such as in college basketball. Although a playoff system has been discussed, 
and some coaches favor it, nothing has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The major bowls are opposed to a playoff formula, figuring that it might damage 
their prestige if, say, the Rose Bowl or the Orange Bowl were designated as 
semifinal NCAA playoff games, rather than the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
One final thought: What if there are some tie games in the strategic bowl 
games? That's another problem for the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Gamesmanship in the Orange Bowl began Dec. 22 when Colorado Coach Bill 
McCartney brought his team to Miami. Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, whose team 
didn't arrive until Monday night, has said that preparation is difficult at a 
bowl site because of bowl-related activities and distractions. 
</P>
<P>
"All you try to do is control damage," Holtz said. "You don't even know if the 
ball is blown up or stuffed." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney interpreted Holtz's comments as second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Holtz questions our strategy in coming down here early and spending time 
with the beautiful people of Miami," McCartney said. "I don't understand that. 
(Former Oklahoma coach) Barry Switzer said he always came down early and felt 
like it was the ideal way to prepare his squad. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Switzer is the guy I want to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney said the Buffaloes came to Miami early because cold weather and snow 
in Colorado made it difficult for them to practice at home. 
</P>
<P>
The players seem to be enjoying the change in climate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for us to come down here and get used to the weather," wide 
receiver Jeff Campbell said. "We're coming from a place where there isn't any 
oxygen to a place where there's a lot of oxygen. So we have to get used to 
stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Darian Hagan, a Los Angeles native: "This is good weather to 
practice in. We're living it up right now." 
</P>
<P>
Said McCartney: "I'm not in any way concerned about being down here too long." 
</P>
<P>
Your move, Lou. 
</P>

Trivia time: What is the name of the only bowl game ever played in Havana, and 
which teams participated? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Monday's Rose Bowl game will be played on the 50th anniversary of the 1940 game 
between USC and Tennessee. The game was unique in that it marked the second 
consecutive year that USC defeated Rose Bowl opponents who came into the game 
unbeaten, untied and unscored upon. 
</P>
<P>
USC beat Duke, 7-3, in the 1939 game on Doyle Nave's last-minute touchdown pass 
to Al Krueger. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans then spoiled Tennessee's perfect record, 14-0, behind the running 
and passing of tailback Ambrose Schindler. 
</P>
<P>
USC's victory prompted Henry McLemore of United Press to write: 
</P>
<P>
"They raise them rugged out here. Perhaps nature sees that they do in order 
that they will be able to withstand earthquakes, unusual weather and the water 
that comes out of the taps. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lesson to be learned from the Rose Bowl game. There is no sense in 
betting on a team that buys its clothes in the boys' department to beat a team 
that has to shave twice a day and is fitted for suits in the adult or grown-up 
section." 
</P>
<P>
It was the last Rose Bowl game for USC Coach Howard Jones. He died in 1941, 
leaving a legacy of five Rose bowl victories without a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
If Miami wins the national championship, Dennis Erickson will become the first 
coach in 41 years to get the title in his first year at a school. Michigan's 
Bennie Oosterbaan was the last coach to do it, in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Bacardi Bowl on Jan. 1, 1937, when Auburn and Villanova 
played to a 7-7 tie.
