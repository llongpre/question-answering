They all laughed last year when I picked UCLA to defeat USC. "At what?" they 
asked. "Synchronized swimming?" One guy in my office who attended USC wondered 
aloud how I could write such a thing and expect to be taken seriously. Hey, 
babe, I don't like to be taken seriously. I just like to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, they would have laughed just as hard last year had I picked UCLA to 
defeat Cal State Fullerton . . . or Cal Tech . . . or Kal Daniels. Not only did 
UCLA's 1989 team not belong in the Rose Bowl, it couldn't have been elected 
best float in the Rose parade. The queen's dress had better material than Terry 
Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, that didn't stop me. Bravely, I went with UCLA. On USC's field, yet. I 
demonstrated my courage. I danced with wolves. I dared the men of Troy to spit 
in my eye. But after the game, they couldn't. Their chins were too low. 
</P>
<P>
USC lost to UCLA, 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
I know, I know; that's a tie. But I know and you know -- and you know that 
everybody else knows -- that the Trojans got their helmets handed to them. They 
had excellent football players -- even beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl -- but 
they couldn't beat UCLA. The Bruins tied them up, tied them down. 
</P>
<P>
It was the definite highlight of a UCLA season in which the players protected 
Donahue's consecutive streak of victories in bowl games by not playing in one. 
This is a major accomplishment, by the way, in an American era in which bowl 
games outnumber Taco Bells and 7-Elevens, two to one. 
</P>
<P>
For USC, last year's game was a terrible disappointment, mostly because from 
November to January, all the student body had to look forward to was . . . 
yuck, basketball. 
</P>
<P>
And now, 12 months later, they're back! . . . Trojans and Bruins! . . . you 
know 'em, you love 'em! . . . well, you know 'em! . . . to clash in college 
football's greatest rivalry! . . . unless, of course, you attended Michigan, 
Ohio State, Harvard, Yale, Navy, Army, Stanford, Cal, Texas, Texas A&amp;M, 
Wabash or DePauw! . . . Saturday in Pasadena, 12:30 p.m., be there! . . . (or 
be somewhere else). 
</P>
<P>
And I know what you're asking: 
</P>
<P>
"Mike, who's gonna win?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, first off, let me tell you right up front that I haven't the slightest 
idea where you get the nerve to think you know me well enough to call me by my 
first name. And next off, look: I have no personal stake in this game. I did 
not attend UCLA. I did not go to USC. The college I attended barely had indoor 
toilets, much less football. We didn't even have cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Read my lips: I don't care which team wins. 
</P>
<P>
But what the heck, I'll take a shot. It's the least I can do. (The most I can 
do being early retirement.) My boss is pretty worried that I'll insult 
somebody. My boss is one of those guys who believes in being overly respectful 
and polite and mealy-mouthed about every college football team in America. My 
boss went to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Here's my USC-UCLA scouting report: 
</P>
<P>
TOMMY vs. TODD: Tommy (Auto) Maddox, the UCLA quarterback, has had a better 
season than Todd (Classes? I Don't Need No Stinking Classes) Marinovich, and I 
predict that if Marinovich should decide to turn pro by the end of the season, 
Maddox should decide to turn pro by the end of Saturday's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy the gun has been one fresh freshman. Only two things kept UCLA from 
having a miserable season, and one of them was Maddox. The other one was 
Stanford, which prides itself on keeping just about everybody from having a 
miserable season. 
</P>
<P>
As for Todd, should he even start? Larry Smith takes out Shane Foley after 
touchdown drives. Does Foley use too many plays when he leads USC to 
touchdowns? Does he drink too much Gatorade on the sideline? Does he wipe his 
dirty hands on the coach's shirt? What? Come back, Shane, come back! 
</P>
<P>
COACH RED vs. COACH BLUE: I call them that because Smith is always mad and 
Donahue is always sad. 
</P>
<P>
At least, it seems that way. Larry dislikes agents rubbing elbows with his 
players and NFL scouts attending practice and referees suspending games because 
of thunderstorms. Terry thinks everybody in the media is negative unless the 
next day's headline reads: UCLA LOSES AGAIN, BUT TRIES REALLY, REALLY HARD. 
</P>
<P>
This game means a possible Liberty Bowl trip for UCLA, putting Donahue's bowl 
streak on the line. The Liberty Bowl is in Memphis. If UCLA wins Saturday, the 
most valuable player should face the TV cameras and say: "I'm going to 
Graceland!" 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE OF THE BANDS: Advantage, USC. The UCLA team does not have a chance in 
hell to win this game, and might forfeit it, if the Trojan band plays that 
school song over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over 
and over and over, as is its custom. Saddam Hussein would surrender if 
subjected to similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
THE REAL ROSE BOWL: This is it. Lord knows you don't want to watch that thing 
coming up New Year's Day. What is it, Washington against Iowa? Boy, I can 
hardly wait. That game won't even interest people from Washington or Iowa. That 
game will have TV ratings like "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's big Troy-Donahue battle, I'll go with the Trojans by a couple of 
points. But I could be wrong. Could be three.
