Even if USC lost twice in its last six games, it probably would be invited to a 
New Year's Day bowl game, Jim Brock, executive director of the Cotton Bowl, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"USC's always been on our wish list," Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
"With three losses, I don't think they'd be out of our hunt. USC is definitely 
on our elite list. They're in the upper echelon. I'd be surprised if USC wasn't 
on everybody's list."

Representatives of eight bowl games -- the Cotton, Citrus, Holiday, Freedom, 
Sugar, Copper, Peach and John Hancock -- will be at the USC-Arizona game 
Saturday at the Coliseum.

"They've got a marquee player in the quarterback (Todd Marinovich)," Brock said 
of the Trojans. "They've got other players who are going to be future stars in 
the NFL. They've got tradition, a great record since (Coach) Larry Smith has 
been there. They're appealing. I could see a potential USC-Texas or USC-Texas 
A&amp;M matchup (in the Cotton Bowl) as being a really marquee football game. 
</P>
<P>
"USC's always going to be in the elite bowl-invitation group. Any New Year's 
Day bowl would love to have them." 
</P>
<P>
According to research by the Pacific 10 Conference and the NFL, USC had 38 
players on opening-day NFL rosters this season, more than any other school.
