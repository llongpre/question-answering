   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied
for first in the Nielsen ratings for last week after playing second
string to football the previous week.
   None of the post-season bowl games were in the top 10 last week,
and several ranked near the bottom of the ratings. Football
dominated the ratings the previous week.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was third in a week that began to look like
normal again. CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote'' made it
back into the top 10. CBS' ``Designing Women,'' which had a
one-hour special episode with guest star Dolly Parton and featured
the birth of Charlene's baby, was No. 10.
   The highest ranked football game last week was NBC's coverage of
the Colorado-Notre Dame game in the Orange Bowl, which tied for
12th.
   NBC's coverage of the American Football League playoff between
Pittsburgh and Denver got a higher rating for its run over into
prime time on Sunday. The game, however, was not on the official
Nielsen list. NBC and CBS listed the run over as 12th and the
Orange Bowl as 13th, but the pro game was not listed by ABC.
   NBC handily won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the week, and
CBS regained second place. The network averages: NBC 15.8, CBS
13.4, ABC 12.1. A ratings point represents the percentage of the
nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned to a show.
   Season to date, NBC leads with an average of 14.8 to ABC's 12.9
and CBS' 12.2.
   Here's the top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied;
ABC's ``Roseanne''; NBC's ``The Golden Girls''; CBS' ``60
Minutes''; NBC's ``A Different World''; CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'';
NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ABC's ``Wonder Years'' tied; and CBS'
``Designing Women.''
   CBS' ``Murder in Black and White,'' the third movie with Richard
Crenna in the same role as a New York police detective, was 20th.
Its Sunday competition, the first part of the two-part NBC
miniseries ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story'' was in a three-way tie
for 34th.
   Two police shows debuted last week. ABC's ``Father Dowling
Mysteries'' was 46th and CBS' ``Max Monroe: Loose Cannon'' was 58th.
   Here's the standing for the other bowl games: ABC's Rose Bowl
tied for 28th, NBC's Fiesta Bowl 61st and ABC's Sugar Bowl 75th.
   CBS won first place among the evening news shows after a long
winning streak by ABC's ``World News Tonight.'' ABC trailed in
second place by a tenth of a point. ``The CBS Evening News'' was on
five days last week, while ABC and NBC did not have Monday shows on
New Years Day. The ratings: CBS 12.0, ABC 11.9, NBC 11.0.
