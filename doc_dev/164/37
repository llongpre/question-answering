<LEADPARA>  It's the first big elimination day in college football. Not from the national
championship, but from Jan. 1 bowl games.;   No. 11 Iowa and No. 13 Ohio State
are each 3-1 in the Big Ten Conference, and one probably will be eliminated
from the Rose Bowl race.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     No. 9 Nebraska and No. 15 Colorado are both unbeaten in the Big Eight, and
one probably will be eliminated from Orange Bowl contention.;   No. 24
Arkansas plays No. 21 Baylor in the Southwest Conference and must win to
maintain its lead for a Cotton Bowl berth.;   And No. 6 Florida needs to win
at Auburn in a Southeastern Conference game to keep ahead in the Sugar Bowl
race.;   Iowa Coach Hayden Fry is 2-7-1 against Ohio State. Moreover, Iowa has
won just once at Ohio Stadium in the last three decades.;   Iowa and Ohio
State are each 6-1 overall and trail Michigan (4-0) in the conference.;  
Nebraska tight end Johnny Mitchell has heightened the emotions in the game
between Nebraska and Colorado.;   "Colorado is just Kansas State or Kansas to
me," Mitchell said. "I don't think they can compete on our level for a long
time. We gave them life the last couple of years. I don't think we should have
given them that much respect. . . . They have gotten some great breaks.";  
Colorado beat Nebraska 27-21 in Boulder in 1989 and rallied from a 12-0
deficit to win 27-12 in Lincoln last year.;   This season, Nebraska is 6-1 and
Colorado 5-2.;   "I thought we might have their respect by now," Buffaloes
linebacker Greg Biekert said, "but I guess the last two years haven't made any
difference."  </TEXT>
