<TEXT>     Also included are the Big East and Atlantic Coast conferences, which last
year added to their fold perennial national title contenders Miami and Florida
State, respectively. The Big Eight Conference will continue to send its
champion to the Orange Bowl. Southwest Conference-Cotton Bowl and Southeastern
Conference-Sugar Bowl affiliations also will continue.;    The agreement still
must be put into writing.;    Under the plan, scheduled to take effect in the
1992 season, the lineups for the four bowls would be decided by a prearranged
system.;    After the Big Eight, SWC and SEC champions are determined, the
other slots for the four bowl games would be filled by a five-team pool, which
would include Notre Dame, the champions of the Big East and ACC, and two other
highly ranked at-large teams. The at-large teams could be independents or
conference members.;    The highest-ranked team in the pool would go to the
bowl that offers the highest-ranked opponent.;    The coalition plans to wait
until after the final regular-season poll in early December to determine its
bowl pairings.;    The Fiesta Bowl -- which has no conference affiliation --
would play host to the national championship game if the five-team pool
includes the teams ranked No. 1 and No. 2.;    Notre Dame and the champions of
the ACC and Big East have the option of declining one bowl's invitation to
play in another bowl within the alliance.;    The deal doesn't ensure that the
two top-ranked teams will meet each Jan. 1. For example, the No. 1 team might
come from the Big Eight and the No. 2 team from the SEC, and under that
scenario, the alliance has no provision for putting the teams into the same
bowl.;    The Rose Bowl, which extends automatic berths to the Pacific 10 and
Big Ten champions, might also eclipse the new alliance's top matchup.;    Rose
Bowl officials held no discussions with the alliance.; PRO FOOTBALL: New
Orleans defensive lineman Frank Warren, who served a one-year drug suspension,
has been cleared to return to the league, Saints President Jim Finks said. . .
. Cornerback Dwayne Woodruff, 34, the last active member of a Pittsburgh Super
Bowl champion, retired.; PRO BASKETBALL: The Milwaukee Bucks signed center
Moses Malone, 36, to a two-year contract. Malone, an unrestricted free agent,
played for Atlanta last season.; MISCELLANY: The University of Arizona took
the recommendation of a hearing board and exonerated basketball player Khalid
Reeves concerning allegations that he sexually assaulted a female student. . .
. U.S. sprinter Michael Johnson ran the season's fastest 400 meters in 44.17
seconds in Lausanne, Switzerland. Merlene Ottey ran the fastest women's 100 in
the world this year with a 10.84 clocking. . . . In Santiago, Chile, Gabriel
Batistuta scored with nine minutes remaining to give Argentina a 1-0 victory
over Chile in the America Cup, the South American soccer championship. In the
day's first game, Paraguay beat Venezuela 5-0.  </TEXT>
