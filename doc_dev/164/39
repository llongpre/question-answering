   Friday, Dec. 26, 9-11 p.m. ET, on PBS (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): "Hansel &amp; Gretel." 
This Engelbert Humperdinck never wore tight lame in Vegas, but he did write a delightful, musically adult opera based on the Grimm's fairy tale about two lost children and a witch, here performed by an all-star European cast. 
A Unitel, Munich production. 

   ---
   Friday, Dec. 26, 9-11 p.m. ET, on CBS: "The Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts." 
Receiving high-toned kudos at the annual awards bash will be Lucille Ball, Ray Charles, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Yehudi Menuhin and Antony Tudor. 

   ---
   Saturday, Dec. 27, 10-11 p.m. ET, on ABC: "Diagnosis Malpractice." 
The ABC News "Closeup" unit specializes in state-of-the-art documentaries with a punch. 
This one is about two battling titans, the legal and the medical professions, locked in combat over skyrocketing malpractice litigation. 

   ---
   Sunday, Dec. 28, 9-10 p.m. ET, on WNYW in New York; various dates and times in other markets served by Orbis Communications (check local listings): "The Entrepreneurs, Program III, Expanding America." 
Underwritten by Wang Laboratories and hosted by Robert Mitchum, this series of six films pays handsome tribute to the persistence and originality of America's business pioneers. 
If you missed the first two, cheer up. 
They get more lively and contemporary as they go along. 

   ---
   Sunday, Dec. 28, 9-11 p.m. ET, on CBS: "The Return of Sherlock Holmes." 
The remarkable Holmes still receives over 1,500 letters a year, so perhaps it's not too far-fetched to imagine, with this TV movie, that he exists somewhere in a cryogenic slumber, just waiting to start sleuthing again. 
The accomplished British actor Michael Pennington stars in this . . . uh, revival. 

   ---
   Wednesday, Dec. 31, 11:30 p.m.-1 or 1:30 a.m., all three networks: New Year's Eve. 
Folks, 1987 was bound to come. 
Nothing to do except toast the cherub, swill champagne and channel-zap between Johnny Carson, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, the hot crowd at Times Square, Dick Clark, David Letterman, and the sizzling mob at L.A.'s Vertigo Club. 
I could tell you which is on which network, but that would spoil the fun.

   Thursday, Jan. 1, from the hour you rise till the hour you drop, all three networks will be offering Football and Parades (all times ET). 
The Cotton Bowl Parade will kick off the big day in Dallas at 10 a.m. on CBS; the pre-Rose Bowl Tournament of Roses Parade marches through Pasadena, Calif., at 11 a.m. on NBC and CBS; the Citrus Bowl (Auburn vs.

Arkansas) at 8 p.m. 

   ---
   Thursdays, Jan. 1-15, 9-10 p.m. ET, on PBS: "A Murder is Announced." 
Truly, here is a Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) who surpasses the amusing (but-untrue-to-the-Agatha-Christie- original) Margaret Rutherford. 
She appears rather late in the first episode, so wait patiently. 
She's worth it. 

   ---
   Friday, Jan. 2, 8-11 p.m. ET, on NBC: The game everyone is waiting for: The Fiesta Bowl. 
Miami (Florida) led by Heisman Trophy winner Vinny Testaverde faces Penn State in Tempe, Ariz., for the Division 1-A Championship. 

   ---
   Sunday, Jan. 4 and Tuesday, Jan. 6, 9-11 p.m. ET, on CBS: "At Mother's Request." 
Those who relished the twisted tale of Frances Schreuder, the heiress who manipulated her son into murdering her millionaire father, will also relish the fact that both CBS and NBC have made miniseries about the crime. 
First to air is this whodunit version starring Stefanie Powers; it focuses on crime-solving more than on character-delving, but it's riveting nonetheless. 

   ---
   Monday, Jan. 5, 10-11 p.m. ET, on NBC: "To Be A Teacher." 
Sponsored solely by IBM, this NBC White Paper will sober you up really quickly on the subject of what it's like to be in charge of a public-school classroom nowadays. 

   ---
   Wednesday, Jan. 7, 10-11 p.m. ET, on PBS: "Back at the Ranch." 
Cattle are more tractable than students, but it's no picnic being a rancher, either. 
This production of Nebraska public TV is a bit on the slow side, but it's also fair, interesting and informative.
