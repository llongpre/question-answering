USC DEFEATED; IRISH, UCLA WIN IN BOWLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame staked a claim to its 14th national football championship, and the 
roses went to Michigan as the glut of college bowls wound up with an 
extravaganza of seven games Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Fighting Irish completed the first 12-0 season in their storied 
football history with a 34-21 victory over third-ranked, previously undefeated 
West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz., and the No. 11-ranked 
Woverines rallied in the second half to beat fifth-ranked USC, 22-14, in the 
75th Rose Bowl at Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-ranked UCLA upheld the honor of the Pacific 10 Conference, winning a 
record seventh straight bowl game by downing eighth-ranked Arkansas, 17-3, in 
the Cotton Bowl at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clemson Beats Oklahoma 
</P>
<P>
In other games, No. 13 Clemson beat No. 10 Oklahoma, 13-6, in the Citrus Bowl 
at Orlando, Fla., and No. 17 Syracuse dominated No. 16 Louisiana State, 23-10, 
in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In night games, No. 2 Miami played No. 6 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl at Miami, 
and No. 4 Florida State faced No. 7 Auburn in the Sugar Bowl at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame will likely receive its first national title since 1977 today when 
the Associated Press' final poll of the media is released. Coach Lou Holtz will 
join Irish coaches Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian and Dan Devine in winning 
national titles in their third seasons at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy won in 1943, 1946, 1947 and 1949, Parseghian in 1966 and 1973, and Devine 
in 1977. Knute Rockne won 6 other national titles before the AP poll began in 
1936. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Tony Rice led the way for Notre Dame, passing for 2 
touchdowns and a career-high 213 yards. Rice also rushed for 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame built a 23-6 half-time lead, and West Virginia (11-1) had to settle 
for the first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history. 
</P>
<P>
USC (10-2) had a 14-3 half-time lead but was overpowered by Michigan (9-2-1) in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler only his second victory in nine 
trips to the Rose Bowl and marked the first time the Big Ten had won 
consecutive Rose Bowls since the 1964-65 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State defeated USC, 20-17, last year. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan fullback Leroy Hoard rushed for 142 yards and scored two 
fourth-quarter touchdowns. Hoard put the Wolverines ahead, 15-14, with a 1-yard 
touchdown run early in the final period, then locked up the victory with 
another 1-yard scoring run with 1:52 left. He set up the last touchdown with a 
61-yard gain to the Trojan 9. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rodney Peete, frustrated most of the game by the Michigan defense, 
scored for USC on runs of 1 and 4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) used the efficiency of quarterback Troy Aikman and an overpowering 
defense to become the first school ever to win bowl games in 7 consecutive 
seasons -- all with Terry Donahue as coach -- before a partisan Arkansas crowd 
of 74,304. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' victory streak also includes 3 Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl, an Aloha 
Bowl and a Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 19 of 27 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown, and converted 
12 of 20 third-down situations into first downs. Freshman Shawn Wills gained 
121 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys are expected to make Aikman their first pick of the National 
Football League draft. Cowboy personnel director Gil Brandt congratulated 
Aikman under the goal posts after the game. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was the UCLA defense that carried the day, holding Arkansas (10-2) 
to 42 yards of offense and 4 first downs.
