   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied
for first place in the ratings in a holiday week in which none of
the post-season football bowl games made the Nielsen Top 10.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was third and CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and
``Murder, She Wrote'' were back near the top as the ratings began
to return to normal.
   Football dominated the ratings during the previous week. This
ratings period the top-ranked game was NBC's coverage of Colorado
and Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl. It tied for 12th place.
   The spill over into prime time of NBC's coverage of the AFL
professional playoff between Pittsburgh and Denver got a higher
rating, but was not included on the official Nielsen list. NBC and
CBS put it in 12th place in their version of the list and the
Orange Bowl tied for 13th. ABC did not count the pro game in its
list.
   CBS' ``Designing Women,'' which had a one-hour special episode
with guest star Dolly Parton and the birth of Charlene's baby, was
No. 10.
   NBC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the week ended Jan. 7
by a wide margin and CBS took over second place again from ABC. The
network averages: NBC 15.8, CBS 13.4, ABC 12.1. A ratings point
represents the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television
homes tuned to a show.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with an average of 14.8. ABC
is second with 12.9 and CBS is third with 12.2.
   Here's the Top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied,
ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls,'' CBS' ``60
Minutes,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,''
NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ABC's ``Wonder Years'' tied, CBS'
``Designing Women.''
   CBS' ``Murder in Black and White,'' the third movie with Richard
Crenna in the same role as a New York police detective, was 20th.
Its Sunday competition, the NBC miniseries ``Drug Wars: The
Camarena Story'' did not do nearly as well. The opening episode of
the three-part show was in a three-way tie for 34th.
   Two new series had premieres last week. ABC's ``Father Dowling
Mysteries'' was 46th and CBS' ``Max Monroe: Loose Cannon'' was 58th.
   Here's how the other bowl games fared: ABC's Rose Bowl tied for
28th, NBC's Fiesta Bowl 61st and ABC's Sugar Bowl 75th.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married ... With Children'' tied for
43rd place.
   CBS took first place among the evening news shows away from ABC
for the week. ABC fell to second place by a tenth of a point. ``The
CBS Evening News'' was on five days last week, while ABC and NBC
did not have Monday shows. The ratings: CBS 12.0, ABC 11.9, NBC
11.0.
   The lowest-rated show was ABC's ``Mission: Impossible.'' Here
are the five bottom network shows: ABC's ``Saturday Night With
Connie Chung,'' ABC's ``Life Goes On,'' CBS' ``Tour of Duty,''
ABC's Sugar Bowl, ABC's ``Mission: Impossible.''
