There is still a chance that UCLA will play in a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific 10 Conference has informed UCLA Athletic Director Peter Dalis that 
there might be an opening in the Dec. 27 Liberty Bowl at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The conference also mentioned a possibility of a berth in the Independence Bowl 
in Shreveport, La., but UCLA rejected that because preparation for the Dec. 15 
game would have interfered with final examinations, Dec. 10-14.

Air Force is tentatively scheduled to play the loser of the Ohio State-Michigan 
game in the Liberty Bowl. But, if Air Force (5-5) loses at Texas El Paso (3-6) 
Saturday, and UCLA (5-5) beats USC, the Bruins would land in the Liberty Bowl. 
NCAA rules prohibit teams with a losing record from playing a bowl game.

UCLA played in the Liberty Bowl in 1976, losing to Alabama, 36-6, in freezing 
weather. MAL FLORENCE
