<P>
Of the remaining undefeated teams with a chance at the national championship 
(sorry Fresno State), it appears that Virginia has the easiest path to an 11-0 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are no sure thing, but compared to unbeaten Notre Dame, Florida 
State, Nebraska, Tennessee and Auburn, they have the most accommodating 
schedule. Incidentally, Houston, Oklahoma and Florida are not included in this 
list of undefeated teams because they aren't eligible to compete in bowls this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Now then, consider each team's most difficult remaining opponents: 
</P>
<P>
NOTRE DAME -- Miami, Pittsburgh, Tennessee, Penn State and USC. Three of the 
five games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA STATE -- Miami, Auburn, Louisiana State and Florida. The Miami and 
Auburn games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
NEBRASKA -- The Cornhuskers still have to play Oklahoma at Norman, Okla., and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
TENNESSEE -- Florida, Alabama and Notre Dame. All three games are at home, but 
the Gators are tough; Alabama is Tennessee's fiercest rival, and Notre Dame is 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
AUBURN -- Florida State, Florida, Georgia and Alabama. If the Tigers can get 
past Florida State, they still have the Gators, at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
VIRGINIA -- North Carolina State, Georgia Tech and Maryland. Not exactly 
murderer's row, is it? All three are home games, which doesn't make them 
gimmes, but . . . Fast-improving Georgia Tech could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's rise to No. 4 in the Associated Press poll is important to the 
Cavaliers for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's the highest football ranking in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could change the entire bowl picture. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
When the Atlantic Coast Conference, of which Virginia is a member, signed a 
four-year contract with the Florida Citrus Bowl in the summer of 1988, a 
stipulation was included in the agreement. It read that in the first and third 
years of the contract, the ACC champion was committed to the Citrus Bowl and 
vice versa. In the second and fourth years, the Citrus Bowl has the option of 
inviting the ACC champion or another team. This is year No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
But -- and this is where it gets interesting -- a national championship 
contingency exists. The Citrus Bowl can opt out of the agreement if it can 
match the No. 1-ranked team against No. 2, 3 or 4. Likewise, the ACC champion 
-- and let's say it's Virginia -- can opt out of the deal if its ranked no 
lower than fourth and can play the No. 1 team for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
One catch: The ACC champion can leave the Citrus only for the Sugar Bowl, 
Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. That's because the Citrus has no chance at the 
Southeastern Conference, Southwest Conference or Big Eight champions, all of 
which are tied to the aforementioned three bowls. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl is off-limits because the Citrus considers it direct 
competition. The Fiesta has no conference tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
"If all the bowls would have a similar agreement, we'd have a national 
championship game every year," said Chuck Rohe, executive director of the 
Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast. The Citrus Bowl will pay a projected $1.35 million to $1.5 million 
to its teams this year, which is considerably less than what a school could 
expect to earn by playing in, say, the Sugar Bowl, Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. 
According to Rohe, if the Citrus has a chance at keeping Virginia for a 
national title contest, they would ask ABC, which is broadcasting the New 
Year's Day game, to increase the rights fee. ABC isn't under any obligation to 
do so, but you can bet it would if a championship game -- and championship 
ratings -- were available. 
</P>
<P>
No one really expected Florida to be able to strike a deal with the NCAA's 
Committee on Infractions, did they? The Gators basically wanted to devise their 
own punishment for past rules violations. Fat chance. 
</P>
<P>
Recent NCAA sanctions against Florida, 4-0 this season, prohibit a bowl 
appearance after the 1990 season. Outraged Gator officials wanted to trade 12 
football scholarships for the chance to accept a bowl bid and bowl money. The 
committee heard Florida's appeal last weekend, but wasn't swayed. "(A 
university) can ask the Committee on Infractions whatever it wants to," the 
NCAA's David Berst said. 
</P>
<P>
Berst agreed the request was unusual. Not since 1952 has the NCAA removed an 
announced penalty. 
</P>
<P>
There is one solution to Florida's problem: Don't cheat. 
</P>
<P>
How seriously do they take their football at Alabama? When the Crimson Tide 
lost its first three games of the season, radio disc jockeys in Birmingham, 
Ala., and Tuscaloosa, Ala., began giving air time to "Dig Him Up," an awful 
ballad about retrieving the legendary Bear Bryant from his coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, especially new and beleaguered Alabama Coach Gene Stallings, deserves 
that sort of misguided abuse. 
</P>
<P>
And those sightings of Danny Ford at Alabama can be disregarded. Stallings is 
safe. Ford, a former Crimson Tide player who was forced out as Clemson's coach, 
is a welcome visitor, said Alabama Athletic Director Hootie Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
The coach who should be worrying is Mississippi State's Rocky Felker. Ford has 
been mentioned as a possible replacement for that struggling program. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dye's decision to play for a tie against Tennessee continues to receive 
mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Constitution columnist Steve Hummer listed a few of Dye's favorite 
things. Favorite food: Thai. Favorite storm: typhoon. Favorite cowboy lyric: 
"Yippie Tie Yie Yay." Favorite player: Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors agreed with the Auburn coach's move. 
And for what it's worth, so did Virginia's George Welsh. 
</P>
<P>
After Virginia Tech nearly upset No. 2-ranked Florida State at Tallahassee, 
Fla., Hokie quarterback Will Furrer asked a Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter: 
"Did we earn enough respect to get in the ACC?" Virginia Tech, which gained 411 
yards against the Seminoles, desperately wants an ACC invitation. It shouldn't 
hold its breath. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech isn't the only school that wants to jump on the ACC bandwagon. 
The Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl and newly approved Sunshine Bowl are all talking 
to the conference about an agreement once the Citrus Bowl deal ends after the 
1992 game. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Citrus Bowl is pushing for an extension. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to published reports, the Orange Bowl will not automatically follow 
Miami to whatever conference it might eventually join. "There's no commitment 
like that," said Bob Roller, Orange Bowl communications director. "They're not 
trailing Miami." 
</P>
<P>
It can't, mainly because the bowl's contract with the Big Eight runs through 
Jan. 1, 1995. The only way the agreement is voided is if any team leaves the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) Notre Dame, (2) Florida State, (3) Auburn, (4) Michigan, (5) 
Oklahoma, (6) Virginia, (7) Nebraska, (8) Tennessee, (9) Miami, (10) Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Our waiting list: Florida, USC, Houston, Oregon, BYU.
