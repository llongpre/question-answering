A RICH TRADITION; COLORADO VS. STANFORD STANFORD STADIUM 12:30 P.M. SATURDAY;
Stanford football dates back to 1891, when the school played its first game
against Hopkins Academy. The first Big Game against Cal came the next year,
when Stanford prevailed 14-10. In the ensuing years, there have been 53
All-America players, 15 bowl games, including 11 Rose Bowl appearances, and
one Heisman Trophy. The school's football team has been led by such legendary
coaches as Pop Warner, Walter Camp and Bill Walsh and its games have included
such big upsets as last year's shocker over Notre Dame and wild finishes as
the five-lateral defeat against Cal in 1982. (color); PHOTO: Albert; PHOTO:

<TEXT>  Heisenberg when asked about; Stanford University.; When Stanford University
fielded its first football team in 1891, football on the West Coast was still
in its infancy.;   The spirit of college football is said to have started in
the West, but the game being played was very different from the eastern
version, both in rules and caliber. The game played out West was described as
a crude form of rugby.;   The transition that followed is considered the birth
of U.S. football on the West Coast. If so, then Stanford, boasting some of the
most famous and innovative names in college football, may be considered its
home.;   Today, after 53 All-America players, 15 bowl games, including 11 Rose
Bowl appearances, one Heisman Trophy award winner, and participant in one of
college football's greatest rivalries, Stanford is celebrating its 100th
football anniversary.;   During that time, Stanford has a compiled a record of
552-337-51. Stanford did not play football from 1943 to 1945 because of World
War II.;   Currently, there are 12 Cardinal players on NFL rosters. The list
includes Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, Buffalo Bills wide receiver
James Lofton, and Chicago Bears running back Brad Muster.;   "We try to make
people aware, particularly the players, of the pride that goes along with
wearing the Stanford uniform," said Denny Green, in his third year as coach of
the Cardinal. "Right now we have possession of the Legends Trophy, which
started in 1925 for the first time Stanford and Notre Dame met.;   "Pop Warner
was coaching for Stanford and Knute Rockne was coaching for Notre Dame. I
don't think you could have any two more legendary coaches meet on the football
field.";   Some of the most innovative minds of the game coached at Stanford,
including Walter Camp, Warner, Clark Shaughnessy, Chuck Taylor and Bill
Walsh.;   Camp, known as the "Father of American Football" and the first coach
at Stanford in 1892, helped change the style of the game from rugby to
football.;   As a member of the Intercollegiate Rules Committee, Camp created
the line of scrimmage, 11-man team, signal calling, and the quarterback
position.;   He compiled a 12-3-3 record at Stanford before returning to coach
his alma mater, Yale.;   Warner, who coached at Stanford from 1924 to 1932 and
compiled a 81-17 record, was credited by football historians with numerous
inventions, including the single- and double-wing offensive attacks, the
reverse play, huddles between plays and headgear.;    Also, two Cardinal
coaches were named the national coach of the year. Shaughnessy, whose Vow
Boys, led by All-America quarterback Frankie Albert, confused opposing
defenses with his T-formation and man-in-motion schemes, received the honor in
1940.;   Taylor, the only man in college football history to go to the Rose
Bowl as a player (1941), coach (1952) and athletic director (1971-72), all at
the same school, was selected in 1951.;   Stanford, which changed its nickname
to Cardinal from the Indians in 1972, has also had several legendary games.
Some jubilant wins, some narrow defeats.;   Among the great victories are
back-to-Rose Bowl upsets over Ohio State (27-17) and Michigan (13-12) in 1971
and 1972. In 1970, Jim Plunkett was awarded the Heisman Trophy, the only one
in the school's history.;   In the 1974 and 1990 Big Games with Cal, were both
won by the Cardinal (22-20 and 27-25) on last-play field goals by Mike
Langford and John Hopkins, respectively.;   Then, there was last year's 36-31
upset win over Notre Dame.;   "That was one of the great wins in Stanford
history," said Green. "Playing at home and ranked No. 1, they had not lost in
a situation like that since 1954.";   Ironically, some of Stanford's most
bitter losses have been to Cal.;   Stanford suffered close losses in the 1958
(16-15) and 1959 (20-17) Big Games. In the 1959 game, Cardinal quarterback
Dick Norman had an incredible performance, completing 34 of 39 passes for 401
yards.;   "He (Norman) put on one of hell of an offensive display," said Chris
Burford, a Stanford All-American from 1957-59, who played in both games. "We
lost both games, but they were probably two of the greatest games we played
against each other.";   The most memorable, however, was the 1982 Big Game
which featured one of the wildest finishes in college football history.;   Cal
defeated Stanford 25-20 on a game ending 57-yard kickoff return seemingly
stolen from a rugby playbook.;   It featured five laterals, started by Cal's
Kevin Moen and eventually ended with Moen taking it over the goal-line as the
Stanford band ran interference.; Magic moments; Here are some highlights in
Stanford football history.; (box)First team in 1891 went 3-1 without a coach.;
