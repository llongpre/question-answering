<TEXT>
<P>
Troy Aikman was at the crossroads at Texas Stadium Monday, ending a fine 
collegiate career with the kind of passing that made his reputation at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
And, if he is the Dallas Cowboys' No. 1 pick in next April's National Football 
League draft as expected, the quarterback gave hopeful Dallas fans some 
optimisim. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman's third-down efficiency confused Arkansas on two long touchdown drives 
as the ninth-ranked Bruins set an National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record 
with their seventh consecutive bowl victory, beating the Razorbacks, 17-3, in 
the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 12 of 20 third-down opportunities and threw a touchdown pass 
as the Bruins again showed their domination in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) broke a tie with Georgia Tech, Nebraska, USC and Alabama in 
claiming a spot in the record books with a seventh bowl victory. The Bruins' 
victory streak includes three Rose Bowls, a Fiesta, an Aloha and a Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman overcame an early interception to direct the Bruins on touchdown drives 
of 93 and 74 yards as UCLA gained a 14-0 halftime edge over the Hogs, who had 
only two first downs at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 6 straight third-down plays before Mark Estwick scored on a 
1-yard run for a 6-0 Bruin lead after a scoreless first period. The extra-point 
kick made it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the first half, Aikman took UCLA on a beat-the-clock drive in which he 
fooled Arkansas (10-2) for the second touchdown. On third-and-goal from the 
Hogs' 1, he bootlegged the ball on a fake sweep then threw a touchdown pass to 
tight end Corwin Anthony with 21 seconds left for a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas' Kendall Trainor kicked his 24th consecutive field goal, a 49-yarder, 
in the third period to keep the Hogs from a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's only second half points came on Alfredo Velasco's 32-yard field goal in 
the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman made excellent use of UCLA's running game, handing off to freshman 
tailback Shawn Wills 18 times for 120 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman was closely watched by members of the downtrodden Cowboys' organization, 
who are thinking about making him the first pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Coach Tom Landry watched on television but scout Gil Brandt was in the 
press box. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman finished his career at UCLA with a 20-4 record as a starter. He hit 19 
of 27 passes for 172 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's alert defense held Arkansas to only four first downs, one by penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The clear, windless day was ideal for UCLA's passing attack. It was the first 
appearance for a West Coast team in the Cotton Bowl since Oregon played 
Southern Methodist 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A sellout crowd of 74,304 watched Aikman overcome early jitters, failing to see 
Arkansas linebacker LaSalle Harper at the Razorback 12. The interception ended 
a UCLA first-period drive that had reached the Hog 17 after an interception and 
20-yard return by Darryl Henley. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's first touchdown drive was helped by a personal foul against Arkansas' 
Otis Lloyd after Aikman had been stopped short on a third-down run. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman then completed a 10-yard pass to Reggie Moore, a 12-yard pass to Mike 
Farr, and a 9-yard pass to Brendan McCracken, all on third down, on the 93-yard 
scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
The 74-yard scoring drive was aided by Aikman's 20-yard third down pass to Paul 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 8 of 12 third down opportunities in the first half. He also 
completed passes to 10 different receivers as he read the Arkansas defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA lost another chance to score in the third period when Laurence Burkley 
fumbled at the Arkansas 7 and Kerry Crawford recovered for the Hogs. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second meeting between the schools. They tied, 10-10, in the 
1978 Fiesta Bowl.
