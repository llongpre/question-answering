Wayne Duke, retiring commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, was brought to 
tears in the press box by Michigan's 22-14 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
As commissioner for the last 18 years, Duke has been an easy target for those 
who have criticized the Big Ten's recent lack of success in the Rose Bowl. But 
now his conference has won its last two Rose Bowls, Michigan State beating USC 
last year, and Duke couldn't have received a better retirement present. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people are shaking my hand," Duke said, "but you know what, I didn't 
throw one block or make one tackle." 
</P>
<P>
In the category of outdated jokes, there's this one that was making the rounds 
before the game: Why does Bo Schembechler eat his cereal off a plate? Because 
if he put it in a bowl, he'd lose it. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Shav Glick, 68, who helped cover Monday's Rose Bowl, saw his 
first Rose Bowl game 57 years ago, when USC beat Tulane in 1932. After that 
game, Glick saw 20 of the next 21 games. 
</P>

Michigan defensive tackle Mark Messner's thoughts on playing against USC's 
Aaron Emanuel: "I didn't like it much. I hit him square on one time, and the 
next thing I know, he was 4 yards downfield." 
</P>
<P>
Messner said he missed Leroy Hoard's 61-yard breakaway run for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all huddled around Coach Carr," Messner said, referring to Lloyd Carr, 
the defensive coordinator. "We're supposed to be concentrating on our huddle, 
so if we even stand up he gets a little mad. We heard the crowd go crazy, but 
nobody moved. We didn't get to see it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Messner's impression of playing against USC's John Guerrero, a 320-pound 
tackle: "They passed so much that it was hard to get a good idea of just how 
good he is. But he certainly is classy. He'd help you up, tell you you made a 
good play. 
</P>
<P>
"Matter of fact, the entire USC team was classy. Some teams, you are out there 
and there is lots of talking and bad-mouthing. There was none of that with 
USC." 
</P>
<P>
When Rodney Peete turned a broken play into a 23-yard gain in the second 
quarter, it was the Trojan quarterback's longest run of the season -- by a 
yard. Peete wound up with 31 net yards in 5 carries and, like player of the 
game Hoard, 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few mistakes by Michigan was a dropped pass by split end Greg 
McMurtry on the USC 15. Quarterback Demetrius Brown hurled the ball nearly 50 
yards in the air, a perfect strike, but it slipped through McMurtry's hands for 
an error. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, no baseball scouts were in the Rose Bowl. McMurtry is such a hot 
baseball prospect that he was offered $172,000 to sign out of high school by 
the Boston Red Sox after they made him their No. 1 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
How's this for a firing technique? A Big Ten source said Monday that the 
University of Wisconsin's football troubles may have very well started a year 
ago, when Athletic Director Elroy Hirsch, the Crazy Legs of Rams' fame, was 
called into the office of the interim chancellor and told to sign a sheet of 
paper that was, in essence, his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Wisconsin went 1-10 in football and its once-proud attendance 
showing, always around the 70,000 average mark despite a series of weak teams, 
slipped below the 50,000 average mark.
