During the 1980s, Clemson has won 5 Atlantic Coast Conference championships and 
1 national title. During that span, Oklahoma has won 5 Big Eight championship 
and 1 national title. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 9-2 entering today's Citrus Bowl game. Clemson is ranked 13th, 
Oklahoma 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Clemson Coach Danny Ford believes this game represents a measuring stick 
of sorts for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anxious to play the University of Oklahoma because of their tradition," 
Ford said. "We want to play and see where we are. We know where Oklahoma is. 
They're there every year." 
</P>
<P>
Where Oklahoma is going is on probation. The received National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. sanctions 2 weeks ago, and this will be the Sooners last bowl 
game for at least 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer said the sanctions would have no effect on the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"That won't be an excuse," he said. "Clemson will have more to do with it than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, Ford and his players have described the Sooners in glowing 
terms. Switzer, for one, doesn't believe the praise is deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a good college football team, but we're not anywhere near what we have 
been before," Switzer said, alluding to the teams that went 11-1 in each of the 
past 3 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson, who lost to Florida State and North Carolina State, comes into the 
Citrus Bowl with a 4-game winning streak. The Tigers scored at least 29 points 
in each of those games. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Williams directed an I-formation offense that averaged 397 yards per 
game, the best in Ford's 10 seasons as coach. The senior quarterback, who has 
been named most valuable player in both of his bowl games, doesn't throw often 
or well, but he does win. His 31-10-2 record makes him the winningest starter 
in ACC history. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Williams doesn't throw much is tailback Terry Allen, who became the 
first Clemson sophomore to rush for more than 1,000 yards when he ran for 1,139 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson prefers to keep the ball on the ground, although Williams burned Penn 
State for 214 passing yards in a 35-10 Fiesta Bowl victory last year. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma finished fourth nationally with an average of 343 yards rushing per 
game. However, that was accomplished mostly on artificial turf and with Charles 
Thompson at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sooners take to the grass field of the Citrus Bowl, gimpy-legged 
Jamelle Holieway will be the quarterback in his final collegiate game.
