<P>
Former University of Houston football coach Bill Yeoman, who coached the 
Cougars to national prominence during his 25 years as coach, is expected to 
retire soon from his university fund-raising position, the Houston Chronicle 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Yeoman has served in the fund-raising post since he retired from football 
coaching in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Yeoman, 61, retired with one of college football's winningest records at 
160-108-8. The record was remarkable in that in his last five seasons, UH teams 
won only 22 of 56 games. 
</P>
<P>
The West Point graduate and former player invented the Veer offense, a dominant 
college offense in the 1970s and early '80s. The Veer still is used widely in 
high school football. 
</P>
<P>
In 25 years, Yeoman's teams went to 12 bowl games, including three Cotton Bowls 
in UH's first four years in the Southwest Conference in the late 1970s. His 
1984 team returned to the Cotton Bowl.
