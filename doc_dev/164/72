<LEADPARA>  If the action starts to drag during one of the 17 college football bowl games
to be televised from Christmas through New Year's Day, you might amuse
yourself by counting the corporate logos that flash on the screen.;   That, in
a sense, is what the Internal Revenue Service is doing.  </LEADPARA>

IRS RULING WOULD CUT CORPORATE FUNDS FOR ATHLETIC
EVENTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Under pressure to boost tax receipts, the IRS has targeted the hundreds of
millions of dollars that corporations pay to sponsor athletic events.;   In a
recent opinion affecting two bowl games, the IRS ruled that such funds amount
to advertising fees, not charitable contributions, so the not-for-profit
organizations putting on the games must pay taxes on them at the full
corporate rate of 34 percent.;   And if the Cotton Bowl and the John Hancock
Bowl weren't sacred enough, partisans say the ruling threatens everything from
Olympic sports to major charities.;   More than 100 senators and members of
Congress have signed legislation that would reverse the ruling.;   It wasn't
long ago that television rights fees made up the majority of revenues for the
bowl games. Because they were footing the bill, the networks would not even
allow corporate advertising in the stadiums within camera range.;   But in
recent years, the TV spigot has tightened, forcing organizers to lean more
heavily on corporate sponsorship. Twelve of the 18 major bowl games now have
"title" sponsors. Besides the John Hancock Bowl in El Paso, Texas, and the
Mobil Cotton Bowl in Dallas, they include the Federal Express Orange Bowl in
Miami, the USF&amp;G Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, the Mazda Gator Bowl in
Jacksonville, Fla., and the Poulan-Weed Eater Independence Bowl in Shreveport,
La.;   Corporate sponsorship has become the dominant funding source --
sometimes the sole reason for existence -- for other events, as well. Fortune
500 logos abound on golfing's PGA Tour, for example, where many tournaments
are run by not-for-profit groups and $20 million was raised for charity in
1990.;   "I think every non-profit event organizer is worried that they might
be next," said Jim Roberts, editorial director of Special Events report, a
Chicago-based trade publication.;   In the John Hancock and Cotton Bowl case,
which surfaced publicly just before Thanksgiving, the IRS advised its field
office in Dallas that it should treat the sponsorship payments -- about $1.5
million from Mobil and $1 million from John Hancock -- as fully taxable
"unrelated business income.";   The IRS reasoned that taking money in exchange
for placing sponsors' corporate logos on the 50-yard line and on players'
uniforms and so forth constitutes an advertising business that is unrelated to
the educational purpose for which the not-for-profit organizations had been
established.;   The national governing bodies for amateur gymnastics, soccer,
volleyball and water skiing have received or are anticipating similar IRS
rulings.;   The bowl organizers and sports federations plan to fight the
rulings administratively and in court if necessary.;   Meanwhile, event
organizers facing a 34 percent cut in sponsorship revenue have two options,
said John Hewett, controller of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation in
Indianapolis: "Either they'll cut back or they'll ask (sponsors) for more.
Asking for more is probably not that viable in today's market.";   An event as
popular as the Cotton Bowl could survive, but what if sponsorship funds for
the Public Broadcasting System series "Masterpiece Theater" and "Mystery!"
suddenly became taxable because of the familiar credit line, "brought to you
by a grant from Mobil Corporation"? Because Mobil carries the whole budget,
any cuts mean fewer shows, said Mobil spokesman Peter A. Spina.  </TEXT>
