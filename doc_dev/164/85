<TEXT>     I don't know how this crazy thing happened, exactly. But after so many
seasons of being the country's tackling dummy, the metropolitan Bay Area can
be called the best college football location in the nation. All you have to do
is check out the scenery.;   Cal sits up there in Berkeley with an 8-1 record,
ranked sixth in the country. The Bears will probably spend New Year's Day at
the Citrus Bowl -- although they deserve to play in the more prestigious Sugar
Bowl. Sadly, the Sugar Bowl committee preferred the better name, not the
better team. Repeat after me: Notre Dame sucks slush from a trash can. Feel
better? Thought so.;   Meanwhile, back to the Bay. Over in Palo Alto, Stanford
is 6-3 and ranked 22nd. One more victory will guarantee the Cardinal an
excursion to the Freedom Bowl.;   And finally, just up the street, San Jose
State is also 6-3 and moving inexorably toward another Big West title, which
means another trip to the California Bowl.;    THREE fine teams, bound for
three bowls. No other urban place can say that.;   What about Florida, you
say? I can already hear the folks down there punching their Touch-Tone phones,
angry as acid-washed alligators in a Jacuzzi. I can understand why. Three of
their teams are rated in the top five: Florida State, Miami and Florida.;  
Extremely impressive, I must admit. However, the last time I checked, Florida
was an entire state, not one metropolitan area. It would take 11 hours to
drive from the Miami campus to the Florida campus to Florida State, not
counting all those stops at Stuckey's for pralines.;   By contrast, you could
visit all three Bay Area powerhouses in 90 minutes, wasting lots of gas but
proving a point: We are entering a golden era of local college football.;  
Aren't we?;   "I don't really know," said a cautious Denny Green, Stanford's
coach. "My hat's off to Cal, for what it has accomplished. And I do think a
team that's ranked sixth in the country, a legitimate No. 6, should be in a
major bowl game . . . (but) right now at Stanford we're not as concerned about
a bowl game as we are about beating Washington State this Saturday, because we
need to win one of our last two to get into a bowl.";    EITHER way, when Cal
plays Stanford in 10 days, it will at long last be an authentic Juego Grande.
This year's Big Game will even be nationally telecast on ABC, breaking the
long string of pompon infested UCLA-USC games shown on that afternoon. Green
says it will be a pleasure to send notes to Stanford recruits around the
country, telling them the news.;   "Usually, we have to give them the
satellite coordinates because it's a regional game and they need to pick it up
from a dish," Green said.;   You want more facts? This is the first time since
1978 that all three local teams will finish with winning records. And it's the
first time since 1941 that both Cal and Stanford have gone 2-0 against USC and
UCLA. If you include SJS's victories over Fullerton State and Long Beach
State, that's a 6-0 record against the hated South.;   Will it continue? Will
this season create a momentum that leads to Bay Area dominance for a decade?; 
 "Well, you don't want to go overboard," said Tom Hansen, the Pac-10
commissioner whose office is in Walnut Creek. "Plus, I'm in a neutral
position. But we've certainly seen a resurgence in the programs. It's a
tribute to the coaches and athletic departments.";   Also to the fans, don't
forget. Especially those who sat through the lean times. You remember them,
way back in the '80s. This is a little more fun.  </TEXT>
