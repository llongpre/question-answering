<LEADPARA>  When the Cotton Bowl invited Texas A&amp;M and Florida State to play in Dallas on
Jan. 1, it guaranteed each school $3 million. Nowhere in the invitation did
Cotton Bowl officials say they would withhold $200,000 from each school and
place it in escrow.;   The escrow money is the most tangible evidence of the
dispute between the IRS and bowl games.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BOWL GAMES, FIRMS SPOOKED BY TAX RULING  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The IRS views the approximately $1.6 million paid by Mobil to the Cotton
Bowl as income and taxable at a rate of 34 percent. If the IRS wins its case,
the $400,000 in escrow -- and according to Cotton Bowl head John Stuart, about
$10 million annually in the bowl business -- would go to the federal
government.;   The dispute won't be resolved for months. However, the 15-page
ruling released this month by the IRS has spooked the sports industry. Mobil
and the Cotton Bowl see the money as a charitable contribution. The IRS calls
it money paid for advertising, thus the name: Mobil Cotton Bowl that so
offends many sports fans.;   The IRS views the Cotton Bowl as no different
than Mobil's putting its name on "Masterpiece Theatre," the PBS program that
the oil company began sponsoring in 1971.;   The IRS even maintains that the
Cotton Bowl may have engaged in "unfair competition" with other firms by
providing advertising to Mobil.  </TEXT>
