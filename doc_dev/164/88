<LEADPARA>  The Pick 'Em Day that college football's bowls have given themselves to extend
invitations remains nearly a week away, but Notre Dame's upset loss to
Tennessee on Saturday has ended some of the suspense.;   Some, that is, but
not all. Early deals struck between schools and bowls in recent years ruined
the chance of concocting the best postseason match-ups. There also were a few
bowls burned by teams who, after being locked up, plummeted in the rankings.
That prompted the first-ever Pick 'Em Day next Sunday, which is when bowls are
allowed to open negotiations with the schools of their choice.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That doesn't preclude the bowls from talking about their favorites,
however, which is why Notre Dame's loss clarifies what the possible big bowl
match-ups are.;   The benefactors of the Fighting Irish's demise included the
Orange Bowl and quite possibly Cal, which moved up one spot to No. 6 in the
latest Associated Press poll after the Bears' 27-14 win Saturday over Oregon
State.;   The Orange Bowl, with its enticing $4.2 million payoff, is almost
certain now to get the winner of Saturday's showdown between No. 1 Florida
State and No. 2 Miami. The Big Eight Conference champion, which will be No. 11
Nebraska or No. 16 Colorado, will have the dubious honor of filling the other
half of the bill.;   If the 'Canes lose, they could go to the Sugar, Cotton or
Fiesta. If the Seminoles fall, the Sugar is out because FSU already will have
played Florida, which has clinched at least a tie for the Southeastern
Conference title and the automatic Sugar Bowl berth that goes with it.;  
Irish loss helps Orange Bowl; Had Notre Dame (8-2) been in position to finish
10-1, Fiesta Bowl officials hoped to match a top-five-ranked Irish team
against the No. 1 Seminoles. The loss to Tennessee dropped Notre Dame to
16th.;   "Now that Notre Dame has been beaten, I think very clearly that means
we'll get the No. 1 team," said Orange Bowl President Harper Davidson. "We
heard from certain sources that the players at Florida State said, 'We've got
to go play Notre Dame if they're in the Fiesta Bowl.' Maybe the administration
didn't feel that way, but you have to listen to the kids. Now that Notre Dame
lost, that's no longer an issue.";   Cal may cause time switch; Fiesta Bowl
officials did not return phone calls Sunday, but a bowl source said they were
meeting to discuss the possibility of exchanging television times with the
Hall of Fame Bowl. The only reason they would want to do that is to invite
Cal. The Pacific 10 Conference prohibits its teams from appearing on
television simultaneously; the Rose Bowl, which is between the Pac-10 and Big
Ten champions, airs on ABC at 2 p.m. (PST) on Jan. 1, while the Fiesta is
scheduled to kick off at 1:30 on NBC. NBC has the Hall of Fame scheduled for
10 a.m.;   Notre Dame still has options; Who might the Bears face? No. 8 Penn
State is supposedly the other part of the Fiesta's hastily re-hashed dream
match-up. As for Notre Dame, it says a lot about the program's drawing power
that the Irish should be able to choose between the Cotton and Sugar, even if
they lose this week to Penn State.;   "Notre Dame is not going to get left
out, even with an 8-3 record," Cotton Bowl President John Stuart said. "I
think they'd like to go where they recruit, which would either be the Sugar or
Cotton.";   Sugar may already have Irish; A rumor surfaced Sunday that Notre
Dame already had made an agreement to take the Sugar's payoff of $3.65 million
payoff over the Cotton's $3 million. The Cotton Bowl's next choice to face the
Southwest Conference champion -- which is likely to be Texas A&amp;M -- would be
No. 7 Alabama, Stuart said.;   Although Stuart did not discuss the rumor, he
did say teams have been trying to strike deals with bowls before Sunday's 2
p.m. time to start negotiations. The reason the bowls created the Nov. 17 date
-- with a penalty of $250,000 for anyone found jumping the gun -- was to
prevent themselves from doing the same thing. With the NCAA having lifted its
restrictions, however, schools are allowed to discuss their preferences with
bowl officials.;   Schools hold cards now; "I'm told," Stuart said, "that
several teams have told several bowls, 'We're not going to play in your game.'
It has to do with money, location and how high the opponent is ranked.";   If
that's true, then Pick 'Em Day has stopped bowls from pitching deals to
schools -- and prompted the schools to do the pitching instead.  </TEXT>
