<LEADPARA>  This tax season, football bowl officials around the country are worried about
a big hit by the Internal Revenue Service against the Cotton Bowl that could
threaten all postseason games.;    The PGA Tour and LPGA also are closely
watching the Cotton Bowl case because most of their events, like the bowls,
are run by tax-exempt, non-profit groups.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Nobody is predicting an imminent collapse of the bowls or professional
golf, even if the IRS rules that millions of dollars paid to the Cotton Bowl
by an oil company is taxable.;    But officials of the bowls and golf
tournaments fear an extension of the ruling -- to include television contracts
and other income -- would have much broader ramifications that could hurt
them.;    At conflict initially would be the IRS demand for one-third of the
revenues bowls receive from sponsors, and the NCAA requirement that
three-quarters of the gross revenues go to the universities.;    "If the NCAA
says you've got to distribute 75 percent of your gross and the IRS says it
wants 34 percent of your gross, then that would put the bowls out of
business," Jack French, executive director of the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, said
Friday.; MOTOR SPORTS: A.J. Foyt took to a race track for the first time since
his legs and feet were badly mangled in a crash at Elkhart Lake, Wis., last
year. Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials said Foyt and fellow drivers Jim
Crawford and John Andretti tested cars over the 2 1/2-mile oval. The speedway
was closed to the public and media Friday, but Foyt has scheduled a news
conference for this morning.; GOLF: Phil Rodgers, still seeking his first
victory on the Senior PGA Tour, shot a 5-under-par 67 to build a six-stroke
lead over five players after two rounds of a senior tournament in Scottsdale,
Ariz. . . . Tracy Kerdyk shot a career-low 6-under-par 66 to catch Chris
Johnson for a share of the second-round lead of a $350,000 LPGA tournament in
Tucson, Ariz. . . . PGA Tour and tournament officials canceled a $1 million
event in The Woodlands, Texas, after steady rain washed out the first two
rounds. The tournament was rescheduled for Oct. 23-26. Sunday's final round
will be replaced by a 48-man team scramble with 16 three-man teams competing
for $100,000 in prizes. . . . P.J. Boatwright Jr., long known as the world's
foremost authority on the rules of golf, died of bone cancer at Morristown
Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J. He was 63.; BOXING: Panama's Victor
Cordoba stopped France's Christophe Tiozzo in the ninth round on to win the
World Boxing Association super-middleweight title in Marseille, France. . . .
Martin "El Bombadero Yaqui" Quiroz (36-22-6) faces David "D.K." Kamau (11-0)
