<TEXT>     And they invaded the Cal campus with conquest on their minds.;   Yes, fans
of the bizarre and weird. It was the Invasion of the Bowl Game Scouts in
Berkeley on Saturday afternoon, as the most stunning Cal football season in
four decades continued to spin out yet another improbable but glorious
chapter.;   Saturday's most improbable development: Cal took a 35-7 halftime
lead against Southern Cal and made it look absurdly easy. The Bears then
cruised to a 52-30 victory and scored more points against the Trojans than any
team in the entire history of organized pig bladder competition.;   Saturday's
second-most improbable development: Nine bowl scouts from six games were
tripping over one another in the Memorial Stadium press box. All of them made
nicey-nice talk about the Bears, trying to woo Cal for their game.;   Tom
Fridena, representing Arizona's Fiesta Bowl, was especially phantasmagorical.
He pumped up a scenario whereby -- with the right combination of losses by
top-ranked teams -- the Bears actually could wind up playing for the national
championship.;   "How about a 10-1 Cal team against a 10-1 Notre Dame team in
our Fiesta Bowl game, for the national title?" Fridena asked. "Can you
imagine? I'd love it! Wouldn't you?";   Well, why not? As the sun set over
Strawberry Canyon, with one more Cal triumph in the books, all things seemed
possible. The team's 7-1 record has come as a surprise to everyone except the
Bears themselves.;   "I don't think anyone believes we're a fluke anymore,"
receiver Brian Treggs said. "I just know I don't want to play in a bowl game
on Dec. 25th or Dec. 31st or any of those dates. I want Jan. 1. The (Sun)
Bowl, the Freedom Bowl, we've kind of passed that stage. . . . The Sugar Bowl
sounds nice. Real nice.";   Cal in the Sugar Bowl also sounded real nice to
Chuck Zatarain. This was far more significant, because he is the Sugar Bowl's
secretary.;   "When you can score 35 points in a half, that impresses
everybody," Zatarain said. "People talk about the recognition factor, but if
Cal keeps winning, they'll be recognized. And with the state of California
having the largest population in the union, they are very attractive to the
television networks.";   Zatarain admitted he had never been to Berkeley
before this year. This was no surprise revelation, considering that as
recently as two seasons ago the Bears were 4-7 and losing to Oregon State. But
now, with a 7-1 record, Cal is suddenly a hot property.;   Which brings us to
Saturday's game itself. Cal will want to paste this one in the scrapbook for a
long while. It's clear the Bears really meant it last week when many of them
publicly expressed hatred and scorn for USC. Quarterback Mike Pawlawski did,
and he unloaded for three touchdown passes. Tailback Russell White did, and he
ran for 229 yards.;   Both of them also did their share of jawing at the
Trojans players. After one touchdown run, White even ran over and taunted the
USC band.;   Also, Cal Coach Bruce Snyder did some strategic swaggering of his
own. He pulled out a few trick plays and kept his first stringers in the game
until the last few minutes, despite the huge lead. It still looks so strange,
Cal getting in the face of other teams. But that is the New Berkeley World
Order.;   And the Trojans, we should note, did not like it very much. Larry
Smith, USC's head coach, graciously complimented the Bears as a team, saying
"they have to rank up there with Notre Dame" among USC's opponents so far this
season. But as for White, Smith damned him with faint praise, saying only: "He
played a fine game.";   And what about Cal using its first string almost to
the end?;   "Well, I don't make decisions for their team," Smith said. "That's
his (Snyder's) choice. He's the one to ask. I'm not going to comment on
that.";   The USC players were a touch more eager to respond.;   "Their coach
said before the game he wanted to boost the score against us," said linebacker
Willie McGinest. "That just shows you the type of guy he is.;   "And
personally," continued McGinest, "I can understand Russell White's attitude.
He couldn't get into USC because he didn't have the SAT scores. I guess that's
why he had that hate for us. I don't know what Pawlawski's deal was. There
were a lot of late hits, too, but Cal averages eight personal fouls per game.
So we were expecting that.";   So strange. USC players, ripping Cal players
for talking trash. But for their part, the Bears were unrepentant. White, a
Proposition 48 player who has blossomed into a good student, said he gestured
at the USC band because it kept playing its lumbering "Tribute to Troy" song
over and over (71 times Saturday, by official Mercury News count).;   And
Snyder? He defended his decision to use his No. 1 unit late in the game this
way: "You like to score; that's kind of fun. It's the purpose of the offense.
. . . But I don't think it was any more than that. It wasn't a matter of
pouring it on. We were in a rhythm.";   Treggs, however, did the best job of
summing up the day's accomplishments.;   "I have to be honest with you,"
Treggs said. "When I came here, I never thought we could score 52 points
against a team like USC, with their kind of athletes. But I think they won't
be getting those kind of athletes anymore. I think a lot of them are going to
stroll by USC and UCLA on their way up here.";   A year ago, you would have
called Treggs crazy for making that statement. Saturday, you couldn't. You
could only call him a man with Sugar on his mind.  </TEXT>
