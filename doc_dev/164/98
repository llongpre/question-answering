El Toro quarterback Rob Johnson, The Times' Orange County high school football 
back of the year, has orally committed to attend USC and is expected to sign a 
national letter of intent with the Trojans on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a 6-foot-5, 210-pound senior, was the top-rated quarterback in the 
county, passing for 2,207 yards and 25 touchdowns while completing 71% of his 
pass attempts in 10 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
An all-county wide receiver as a junior, Johnson became the first player in 32 
years to make the team at different positions. But his versatility isn't 
limited to football. He was the Orange County athlete of the year for 1989-90 
after earning all-league honors in football, baseball and basketball. Johnson, 
a right-hander, pitched in the Southern Section 3-A championship baseball game 
at Anaheim Stadium as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he will play football and baseball at USC. He visited Penn State 
and Notre Dame and canceled trips to Iowa and Brigham Young. He will visit USC 
on Jan. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
"I was recruited by some great schools, but the situation at USC was the best 
for me," Johnson said. "I like the (football) coaching staff, the quarterback 
situation, their offense is similar to El Toro's, and the baseball facilities 
are great." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich could return for his junior season as USC's quarterback, but 
there has been speculation he will be available for the NFL draft in the 
spring. Also expected to return at quarterback is redshirt freshman Reggie 
Perry. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with the coaches about the possibility of Todd turning pro, but his 
future never played a part in my decision," Johnson said. "I plan to come in 
and compete for the job. Todd is the No. 1 quarterback. The plan at this time 
is to redshirt my freshman year." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's older brother, Bret, and Marinovich played for rival schools at El 
Toro and Capistrano Valley in 1986-87 and were two of the most highly 
publicized and recruited quarterbacks in county history. 
</P>
<P>
Bret played two seasons at UCLA before transferring to Michigan State, where he 
will be eligible next season. USC will play Michigan State in the John Hancock 
Bowl on Monday, and Rob was asked which team he'll be rooting for. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm for the Trojans all the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And the possibility of a showdown with Bret in a future Rose Bowl game? 
</P>
<P>
"That would sure give the reporters something to write about." 
</P>
<P>
As for baseball, Johnson said he spoke with USC Coach Jim Gillespie during a 
camp in Lodi last summer and figured he had a good opportunity to pitch as a 
freshman. Johnson's fastball has been clocked at 86 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to USC on a football scholarship, and I'll play baseball in the 
spring," he said. "If I'm contributing to the baseball team, I'll remain with 
the team like Rodney Peete did. If I'm not contributing, I'll move on to spring 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has a 3.4 grade-point average at El Toro, said he is undecided 
about his major. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is the second high school quarterback to commit to USC. Last week, Kyle 
Wachholtz, a 6-5, 200-pound senior from Norco High School, committed to the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is the second county player to orally commit to USC, joining Los 
Alamitos receiver Tyler Cashman. Other players who have committed early include 
running back Jeff Grenier of Fullerton (Colorado State) and offensive lineman 
Karl Schroller of Fountain Valley (UCLA).
