NO MIDDLE GROUND IN RIVALRY;

BRUINS: IT'S EITHER THE THRILL OF VICTORY OR HEARTACHE OF DEFEAT AGAINST USC, 
DONAHUE SAYS.

Terry Donahue has participated in the UCLA-USC football series for 21 years as 
a player, assistant coach and head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The cross-town rivalry is an integral, emotional part of his life and he summed 
it up Monday by saying: "There's an unbelievable vacuum between the peaks and 
valleys (of the games). I can remember the games like they were yesterday and 
the thrill of victory and heartache of defeat are hard to describe. But there 
is no land in between." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue conceded that last year's 10-10 tie with USC might have been the vacuum 
filler. 
</P>
<P>
In most instances, though, Donahue has run the gamut of emotions in a series 
that began in 1929, was discontinued from 1931 until 1936 and then resumed 
until the present. 
</P>
<P>
"The wins are the greatest of the greatest and the losses are the worst of the 
worst," said Donahue of his involvement. 
</P>
<P>
So the Trojans and Bruins will battle again Saturday at the Rose Bowl with only 
pride and city bragging rights at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has already clinched a berth in the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the importance of the game is not diluted in Donahue's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of great rivalries in the country," Donahue said, "but there 
is no rivalry in the United States where two major institutions share the same 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"That fuels the competitiveness. We also have the normal factors that go into a 
fierce rivalry. We also have the additional factors of everybody (alumni) going 
to work together, sharing the same office building, same car pool rides and 
going to the same parties." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what was his most satisfying win in the series, Donahue didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 1980," he said. "It was the first time." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his first victory over USC as a head coach after four 
straight losses to the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he reminisced about some of the games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been fighting this battle for a long time and that's what makes it 
unique, too, the struggle and competition," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have the scar where I hit the locker after the 1977 game (USC won, 
29-27, on a late field goal)." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue was on the UCLA scout team in 1964 and didn't play in the game. 
However, as an undersized lineman, he vividly remembers the 1965 game that UCLA 
won, 20-16, on Gary Beban's late, long touchdown pass to Kurt Altenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Kareem Abdul-Jabbar jumping up and down on the field, saying, 
'We're going to the Rose Bowl, we're going to the Rose Bowl.' He was only a 
freshman at the time." 
</P>
<P>
As for the most disappointing losses, Donahue said it was difficult to single 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
"As intense as the rivalry is, there is an element of mutual respect, or 
class," Donahue said. "I never thought the rivalry was bitter as some other 
rivalries. I never felt that way about this game." 
</P>
<P>
His latest involvement was the 10-10 tie last year -- and he had mixed 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
USC was a 17-point favorite and headed for the Rose Bowl. UCLA had a chance to 
win on the final play of the game when Alfredo Velasco's 54-yard field goal try 
hit the cross bar and bounced back onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
"When that ball hit the crossbar and bounced backward, it just summed up our 
season," said Donahue of his team's 3-7-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
This time, a winning season hangs in the balance Saturday for UCLA with its 5-5 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are coming off an emotional, 25-22 victory over Washington in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the win over Washington does two things psychologically," Donahue 
said. "It alerts USC that UCLA is a decent team by beating Washington. And it 
certainly gives our team confidence that we beat the conference champion and 
that we're capable of playing with anyone in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"One factor is to our disadvantage and the other to our advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a great game. USC has a better record (7-2-1), but we have 
a chance to win if we play our best game. It's always an exciting time for the 
city."
