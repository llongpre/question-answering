<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE BISCOTTI from my youth were lemon yellow, tasted mostly of anise and were
as hard as a rock. You had to dunk those babies in coffee or your molars would
come unhinged. Now, biscotti are pretty sophisticated, especially in the Bay
Area where they're almost required at any place that sells cappuccino.;   
Recently I tried several varieties of biscotti from Nonni's, a San Francisco
company. All were exceptional, and none needed softening in your favorite
beverage.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     You might be tempted to call the originali biscotti plain, but they're far
from it. Lots of flavor from ground almonds and walnuts, though they were a
trifle sweet. The company suggests trying them with espresso or red wine,
though I don't think I'd break out my best cabernets. Try a sweet wine, such
as the traditional Vin Santo.;    The cioccolati biscotti have a veneer of
chocolate on the side, which provides a nice contrast. Chocolate decadence
biscotti taste like very good chocolate chip cookies with a delightful
bittersweet chocolate undertone. My favorite is aptly named cioccolato
paradiso. These heavenly biscotti combine chocolate and almond cookies with
slabs of white chocolate.;    Incidentally, Nonni's is so named because the
recipes come from company president Steve Sirianni's grandmother. Nonna is
Italian for grandmother.;    An eight-ounce bag of Nonni's biscotti retails
for about $5.50. They're available at Williams-Sonoma, Nordstrom's, Cost Plus
Imports and at The Perfect Blend in San Jose.;    Perhaps the best name in Bay
Area biscotti is La Tempesta. In December, the South San Francisco company
introduced a line of mini biscotti in three-ounce bags.;    Overall, I didn't
like them as much as Nonni's. My favorite were the Toscani. They have a nice,
toasty almond flavor and just the right crunch. Gianduia have toasted
hazelnuts with a squiggle of milk chocolate. I thought the mezz amore -- made
with almonds and bittersweet chocolate -- were too hard and dry.;    La
Tempesta mini biscotti run about $2.75 ($3.25 for the mezz amore version that
is dipped in bittersweet chocolate). Available at Nordstrom's, Macy's, at
Cosentino's and Zanotto's in San Jose, at Draeger's in Menlo Park and at the
Campbell Coffee Roasting Company in Campbell.  </TEXT>
