   Everybody knows chocolate milk comes from brown cows. 
But few people know what happens when cows eat chocolate candy bars. 

   Some farmers in the Middle Atlantic states have discovered that several sweet things happen. 
Feed bills go down. 
The milk's butterfat content goes up -- and the milk fetches a higher price. 

   That's because milk prices are based on butterfat content. 
The standard for whole milk is 3.5% butterfat. 
For every tenth of a percentage point over that level, a farmer can make an extra $1.28 per 100 gallons. 

   William Flickinger, a livestock nutritionist in Dover, Pa., tells the 60 dairy farmers he advises -- from New Jersey, Maryland and Pennsylvania -- to mix chocolate with the ration of hay, soybeans, alfalfa and grains their herds consume. 
On those farms, the average cow eats four to eight pounds of chocolate a day -- about a tenth of its total diet. 

   "They love it," says Ralph McGregor, a Dover farmer who follows the regimen. 

   For their chocolate supply, Mr. McGregor and the others rely on the salvage center at Hershey Foods Corp. in Hershey, Pa., where damaged KitKats, Reese's Pieces and the like pile up by the ton. 

   The price is right. 
At about $60 a ton, damaged chocolate is a cheaper source of food and energy for cows than corn, which runs $85 a ton. 
Besides, nutritionists say a candy bar, loaded with carbohydrates, sugar and fat, has about twice the energy of an ear of corn. 
And cows need plenty of energy to produce milk. 

   Each month Stephen Mason travels 120 miles from his farm in Chester County, Pa., to pick up 15 tons of reject chocolate. 
He figures adding chocolate to his cows' diet has raised the fat content of their milk to 3.9%, so he pockets an extra $5.12 for every 100 gallons. 

   Chocolate doesn't change the cows' behavior, says Mr. Flickinger, and it doesn't make them gain weight. 
Rather, the nourishment is milked out of them. 

   But the cows don't show much restraint when there's chocolate around. 
"If you put a pile of candy bars out in a pasture," Mr. Flickinger says, "they'd go eat themselves to death." 

   Still, he sees no immediate danger of chocoholic herds. 
"Hershey can't afford to make enough mistakes to keep all the dairymen in the North on candy."
