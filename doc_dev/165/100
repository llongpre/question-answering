STUFFING 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups rice 
</P>
<P>
3 cups water 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 cup diced celery 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup minced parsley

<P>
3 eggs, beaten 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
Spread rice in shallow baking pan and toast at 400 degrees, shaking pan now and 
then to prevent burning, until rice is golden, about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Combine rice, water and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Bring to boil, cover, turn heat 
very low and simmer 15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Cook onion, celery 
and parsley in butter until tender, but not browned. Remove from heat.

Stir in bread crumbs, poultry seasoning, eggs and rice. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper. Toss lightly with fork. Add nuts and mix again. Makes enough 
stuffing for 12- to 16-pound turkey, 2 or 3 roasting chickens, or bake in 
shallow pan at 375 degrees 30 minutes. Makes 8 servings baked separately.
