<LEADPARA>  COOKIES 'n cream. Sometimes we like 'em together, sometimes apart.;   Healthy
Choice has a new line of 98 percent fat-free ice creams (technically called
frozen dairy desserts). I was impressed with the three I sampled. Vanilla (120
calories, two grams of fat per four-ounce serving) is rich and creamy with
good vanilla flavor. Strawberry (120 calories, two grams of fat) has a nice
jammy taste. RockyRoad  (140 calories, one gram of fat) is a good version of
this favorite with rich chocolate flavors and pleasant nutty and marshmallow
accents. Other flavors include Neapolitan, chocolate, praline &amp; caramel,
old-fashioned vanilla, wild berry swirl, Bordeaux cherry and cookies 'n cream.
About $2.79 for a quart, $4.19 for a half gallon.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Wholesome Choice is a new line of low-fat cookies from Pepperidge Farm
($1.79 for 12 cookies). Each cookie has two grams of fat or less and no
tropical oils. Raspberry Tart was my favorite of five sampled (a sixth, Apple
Oatmeal, wasn't available). It reminds me of a linzer cookie, crisp with a
not-too-sweet jam center and a light blanket of powdered sugar. Chewy, fruity
Cranberry Honey was my second favorite. I can do without Date Walnut, Oatmeal
Raisin and especially Carrot Walnut, which has a raw-dough taste.;   But if
you really like the taste of raw dough, try Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Chip
Cookie Dough Ice Cream ($2.59 a pint). Yes, vanilla ice cream with real raw
cookie dough including sugar granules that aren't fully incorporated. My wife,
a dough freak from way back, had only one complaint. "Not enough dough.";  
Fig Newtons, America's third most popular cookie, is celebrating it's 100th
birthday this year. It's been a long time since Mom popped a few in my lunch
box. So imagine my surprise when I found out that Fig Newtons aren't Fig
Newtons any more. They're just Newtons. That's because Newtons now come in
strawberry, raspberry and apple flavors. Both the strawberry and raspberry are
too sweet for me (restaurant critic David L. Beck says he freezes them to cut
the sweetness). Apple is OK. But if you're going to eat a Newton, which, let's
face it, is a pretty dowdy cookie, you might as well go for the original.;  
You can make a different kind of cookies 'n cream by mixing cut-up Newtons
into vanilla ice cream.; FIG NEWTON ICE CREAM; 2 eggs; 2/3 cup sugar; 1 3/4
cups milk; 2 cups cream; 2 teaspoons vanilla; 12 Fig Newtons, cut up into
bite-size pieces;  Beat eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until thick and
cream-colored. Add milk, cream and vanilla. Mix well. Fold in Fig Newtons.
Pour into hand-cranked ice cream maker such as Donvier. Follow manufacturer's
directions. Or, pour into shallow pan and freeze. Serves 4.  </TEXT>
