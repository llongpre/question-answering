   Detroiters upset over a threatened corporate collapse are hitting the sauce -- the chocolate sauce, that is. 

   With local newspapers bannering the possible shutdown by next month of Fred Sanders Inc., a 112-year-old area confectioner renowned for its candies, baked goods, ice cream and dessert sauces, loyal chocoholics are jamming many of the 21 Sanders stores still open. 

   Colleen Shaughnessy, a secretary at a local insurance company, needed three trips to pick up a trio of double-chocolate layer cakes, six almond tea cakes, five pounds of chocolate-covered raisins, 11 large cans of milk chocolate sauce and a 20-ounce jar of bittersweet chocolate sauce. 
Although she promptly air-expressed part of the hoard to an executive who had moved to California, she says she's keeping three cans of sauce "here at my desk for future emergencies." 

   The toppings are causing the greatest hysteria. 
Sales have been so brisk that the company adopted a two-container limit. 
But this didn't daunt customers at the downtown Detroit store who, during a single lunch hour last week, grabbed up more than three dozen jars and cans of butterscotch and chocolate sauces (in regular, milk, bittersweet and swiss varieties). 

   "I take over a lot of troubled companies," says Jay Alix, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. 
"This is the first time I've ever seen so much consumer devotion to the product." 
Mr. Alix adds that Sanders has had calls from people as far away as California and Florida "who say, 'I gotta have that fudge sauce.'" 

   Among the anxious are ex-Detroiters Dave and Mary Lindsay of Neptune, N.J., who ordered one case of sauce and may go for another. 
"The only thing I regret is I can't get their vanilla ice cream," Mrs. Lindsay says. 
"That'd be tough to ship." 

   For some fans, whose desperation is as emotional as it is gastronomic, the sauce is like Proust's madeleine. 
"It's my youth," sighs Detroit native Henry Geller, now a Washington, D.C., lawyer, who grabbed an extra jar on a recent visit. 
"I'm addicted to it because it brings back memories of what I did when I was growing up." 

   Such dedication might not save the business. 
Long plagued by financial and managerial problems, it is facing bankruptcy for the second time in eight years. 
Mr. Alix says these travails have made it hard to find funding for a bailout. 
"People think this is the best fudge sauce in Michigan," he notes, "but the banks don't think this is the best deal in Michigan."
