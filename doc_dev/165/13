<LEADPARA>  ABOUT a quarter of the way through our tour of the Hershey's chocolate factory
in Oakdale, the 3-year-old behind me had a question. Her face pressed up
against the glass that separates the tourists from the vats of chocolate, she
tugged at her mother's shorts and whispered urgently, "How do we get in
there?";    It was the question on all of our minds. And we hadn't even seen
the room where they package the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups yet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The walking tour through the Hershey's plant is enough to drive a normally
docile person to extremes. By the time the tour guide ushers you past the last
pink conveyor belt bearing Hershey's Kisses to destinations in 13 Western
states, Australia and the Far East, you want to take a mallet to the windows,
tackle the guy who watches over the chocolate-chip machine and position your
mouth at the spot where the newly formed chips tumble onto the line leading to
the bagging machine.;    Tours sell chocolate;  Hershey's knows this. That's
why it still conducts free tours -- in an age when most manufacturers, faced
with increased liability insurance costs, live in fear that some oaf might get
his shirttail caught in the candy conveyor and sue them for every Kit Kat bar
they've got.;    Not Hershey's. The Oakdale plant, in the San Joaquin Valley
just off Highway 120 (better known as the Road to Yosemite), herds more than
100,000 people through on tours every year.;    The air-conditioned visitors'
center -- where the wait for a tour can be up to an hour at the height of the
summer season -- is the place to start. Besides the usual Hershey's souvenirs
(cups, kites, shoelaces, T-shirts, baseball caps, etc., all with the logo),
there's an astounding display of candy bars -- every type Hershey's makes, and
in bulk.;    All of this really primes you for the tour -- and makes it even
more difficult to handle being separated by safety glass from the action in
the chocolate factory. There you are, so close to the department where rows of
vats -- each containing 1,000 pounds of liquid chocolate -- are stirred by
mechanical arms. And yet you are so very far away.;    Still, it's quite a
sight for a true chocolate lover. Near the end of the half-hour tour, our
group trooped upstairs to a viewing area from which we could see, all at once:
1) Kisses being wrapped and weighed, 2) Reese's Peanut Butter Cups coming down
the assembly line and 3) Milk Chocolate with Almonds bars (both large and
giant-size) coming out of the chocolate cooling tunnel.;    At this point, a
clump of mature tourists was contemplating leaving retirement for a chance to
work in the factory. Children were hurling themselves against the glass.
Several young women were about to crack emotionally.;    Return to safety;  We
got back on the bus and headed toward the relative safety of the visitors'
center. As we piled off, our tour guide handed us a coupon good for a free
candy bar, and a stampede toward the bins ensued. The 3-year-old behind me
chose a bag of milk chocolate Kisses.;  DETAILS; Tours of Hershey Chocolate
USA are given from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday. The visitors'

make an immediate right into the parking lot. Information: (209) 848-5100.  </TEXT>
