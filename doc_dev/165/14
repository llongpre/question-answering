   A department store is offering Japanese Cupids the
ultimate arrow this Valentine's Day _ a $7,700, 10{-ounce heart of
pure gold engraved with the sender's message.
   Two of the palm-sized hearts have been sold so far, one to a
devoted husband seeking a special gift for his wife's 77th birthday
and the second to a bank, said Hanshin Department Store spokesman
Toru Imamura.
   More cost-conscious schoolgirls and secretaries choose from a
wide array of fancy chocolates and novelty gifts.
   Besides the old standbys _ chocolate hearts with long ribbons
and miniature chocolate whiskey bottles _ this year's items have a
decidedly domestic flavor. ``Sir Dean'' chocolate fish come paired
in a sardine tin with rollback top.
   Flip up the lid to another can of chocolates and you find
chocolate bandages in familiar red, white and blue wrappers with
the warning, ``This chocolate is not medicated sweets.''
   ``Baby Choco'' is softly nestled in a mini-package of disposable
diapers with a smiling tot on the front.
   For the objects of this sweet attention and invention, all is
not a bed of roses. Obligatory chocolates given to male bosses and
colleagues outnumber those of romantic intent, spurring receiving
males to compete in an annual popularity contest.
   The possible embarrassment of being giftless at the end of the
day is enough to keep some men home from work, according to a
Daimaru Department Store survey of 400 men aged 20 to 30.
   Less drastic ways of avoiding embarrassment are broad hints,
extra nice behavior or even buying one's own chocolates for
prominent display. A few men console themselves by saying that
Valentine's Day is a foreign holiday with a short postwar history.
   Chances are good that generosity on Valentine's Day will be
returned on March 14, called ``White Day'' by Japanese candy makers
who urge men to give their favorite women hard candies.
