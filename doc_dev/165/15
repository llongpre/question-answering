<LEADPARA>  LAST year's freeze eliminated tangerine juice from Odwalla's seasonal lineup.
This year, the funky Davenport company says fresh-squeezed tangerine juice
will be produced into early spring.;   Like all Odwalla juices, the tangerine
juice is 100 percent juice. It's also 99  percent delicious. The juice is made
from a variety of tangerines as well as tangelos. Freshness is an obsession
with Odwalla, so many stores will have juice on their shelves within 24 hours
of pressing.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Tangerine juice isn't cheap -- about $1.99 a pint, $3.59 a quart and $5.99
a half gallon. But it's a nice, seasonal treat, especially if you're nursing a
nasty head cold.; (hbox);   I don't normally buy canned coffees from
supermarkets because I find them either harsh or insipid. An exception is Le
Grand Cafe by Melitta ($3.59 for an 11.5-ounce can). In addition to having
some heft from 100 percent Arabica beans (most mass-produced coffees use
cheaper robusta beans), Le Grand Cafe is one of the few canned coffees that
uses an extra-fine grind. That draws out the maximum flavor from the coffee
made with a drip method.; (hbox);   Some fresh-baked biscuits with your coffee
and juice? That little doughboy from Pillsbury has churned out a new line of
biscuits and twists called Hearty Grains. The company makes a big deal about
how these refrigerated, ready-to-eat items, "provide whole grain taste and
crunchy texture." But the first ingredient in each of the four products is
bleached enriched flour. So much for whole grains.;   On the plus side, all
four have no cholesterol and are low in fat -- two grams per serving. All
except Oatmeal Raisin Biscuits (90 calories) have 80 calories per serving.;  
As for taste, Cracked Wheat &amp; Honey Twists and Country Oatmeal Twists (both
$1.89 for 10 twists) fall somewhere between rolls and soft bread sticks. I
preferred the latter for its nuttier flavor. Better than the twists are
Oatmeal Raisin Biscuits and Multi-Grain Biscuits (both $1.19 for eight
biscuits). I liked the Multi-Grain better. Must have been that "whole grain
taste.";   Also new from Pillsbury are Oven Lovin' Cookies ($2.99). None are
going to rival your family favorites, but they might be a decent alternative
if, in the holiday hubbub, you don't have time to make cookies from scratch.
Chocolate Chip uses Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips. Candy Cookies use
Brach's candies and aren't as sweet as you might think. Also available are
cookies made with Reese's pieces.;   The ready-to-bake dough comes in
refrigerated 18-ounce resealable tubs. The yield is listed as 30 to 36
cookies, but those cookies are awfully small.  </TEXT>
