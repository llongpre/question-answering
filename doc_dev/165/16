<TEXT>  SPRITZ BUTTER COOKIES; 1/2 cup blanched sliced almonds (1.5 ounces); 3/4 cup
sugar; 1 cup unsalted butter; 1 large egg; 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract; 1
teaspoon almond extract; 2 cups bleached all-purpose flour; Dash salt; Glace
cherries, sugar sprinkles or dragees (see note);  Place 2 oven racks in upper
and lower thirds of oven. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.;   Place almonds on
cookie sheet and bake them, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes or until
lightly browned. Cool completely.;   Food processor method: Process almonds
and sugar in food processor until they are ground powder-fine. Cut butter into
a few pieces and add them with motor running. Process until smooth and creamy.
Add egg and extracts and process until incorporated, scraping sides of bowl.
Add flour and salt and pulse just until blended.;   Electric mixer method:
Soften butter. Grate almonds powder fine. Cream together sugar and butter in
mixing bowl until fluffy. Add egg and extracts and beat until blended. On
lower speed, gradually add flour, salt and grated almonds and mix until
incorporated.;   For both methods: As soon as dough is prepared, scoop it into
large pastry bag, fitted with number 6 or 7 (about 1/2-inch diameter) large
star pastry tube, or a cookie press and pipe rosettes or stars about 1 3/4
inches in diameter onto ungreased cookie sheets, 2 inches apart.;   For best
shape, hold bag or press so that tube is straight up with toothed edge just
barely touching cookie sheet. Squeeze or press firmly without moving it until
shape is as wide as you desire. Stop pressure completely and push tube down
slightly. Lift tube straight up and away. If dough is too soft and impressions
indistinct, chill dough briefly in bag or press. Decorate with glace cherries,
sugar sprinkles or dragees.;   Bake 10 to 12 minutes, depending on size or
until pale golden. For even baking, rotate cookie sheets from top to bottom
and front to back halfway through baking period. Use small-angled metal
spatula or pancake turner to transfer cookies to wire racks to cool
completely.;   Store cookies in airtight container at room temperature or in
refrigerator or freezer. Cookies will keep 1 month at room temperature,
several months frozen. Makes about 3 1/2 dozen 2-inch cookies.;   Note:
Dragees are hard candies used to decorate baked goods.-- -- From "Rose's
Christmas; Cookies" by Rose Levy; Beranbaum (Morrow).; See SPRITZ , Next Card;
(box) SPRITZ; from Previous Card; SNOWMAN COOKIES; 3 1/2  cups all-purpose
flour; 1 teaspoon baking powder; 1 cup butter; 8-ounce package cream cheese,
softened; 2 cups granulated sugar; 1 egg; 1 teaspoon vanilla flavoring; 1/4
teaspoon almond extract; Cinnamon red hots for buttons, see note; Mini
chocolate chips for eyes; Reese's Peanut Butter cups, cut in half, for hats;
Chocolate frosting to hold hats in place; Green frosting for scarf;  Stir
together the flour and baking powder; set aside. Beat together butter and
cream cheese; add sugar and beat until fluffy. Add egg, vanilla and almond
extract; beat well. Add flour mixture and beat again.;   Begin shaping balls,
shaping a larger ball for the snowman's body and a smaller one for his head.
Flatten slightly when placing on ungreased baking sheet. The balls should
touch each other so that the snowman holds together after baking. Put two red
hots on the larger ball for buttons and two mini chips on the smaller one for
eyes. Bake at 325 degrees about 18 minutes, until set but not brown. Cool.;  
Finish by adding hat -- peanut butter cup half bottom-up held on with
chocolate frosting -- and green frosting scarf piped in place. Makes about 24
large cookies.;   Note: Cinnamon red hots are small red candies slightly
harder than jelly beans, available in the baking section of supermarkets.;

dates, orange juice, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to boiling. Reduce heat to
low; simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture is very thick.
Remove from heat; stir in almonds.;   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grease and
flour a 9-inch-square baking pan. In medium-sized bowl, mix flour, oats, brown
sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. With pastry blender, cut in butter or margarine
until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.;   Pat half of oat mixture onto bottom
of pan. Evenly spread date mixture onto oat layer. Pat remaining oat mixture
onto date layer. Bake 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool in pan on wire
rack. When cold, cut into 18 pieces. Store in tightly covered container.;   --
