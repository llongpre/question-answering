<LEADPARA>  WITH the large number of non-native Californians in the state, it's not
surprising that many readers request recipes they remember from their
childhood in the East or Midwest. When Mrs. Robert Van der Vort of Sunnyvale
responded to the request by June Hirschman of San Jose for a dessert called
cheese freeze from her childhood in Ohio, Van der Vort didn't say where her
recipe has its roots. Perhaps it too comes from the Buckeye State. Here's her
recipe:; CHEESE FREEZE  </LEADPARA>

8-ounce package cream cheese, softened; 2 cups milk; 1 package Jello instant
lemon pudding; 1 9-inch pie shell (any type crust);  Stir cream cheese to

overbeat. Pour into crust. Chill.;   Thank yous for recipes are in order for
Mary Potter of San Jose, Melodie Raposa of Santa Clara and Judy Wong of Menlo
Park.; More zucchini; Ruth Lacey of Palo Alto writes that the secret to
growing zucchini is to plant one-third of what you think you will need. If
that fails, she suggests this recipe.; LEMON ZUCCHINI MUFFINS; 2 cups flour;
1/2 cup granulated sugar; 1 tablespoon baking powder; 1 teaspoon salt; 1
teaspoon grated lemon peel; 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg; 1/2 cup chopped nuts; 1/2 cup
golden raisins; 2 eggs; 1/2 cup milk; 1/3 cup oil; 1 cup packed shredded
zucchini (not drained);  In large bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt,
lemon peel and nutmeg. Stir in nuts and raisins. In small bowl, beat eggs with
fork, beat in milk and oil. Add to flour mixture, then sprinkle zucchini on
top. Stir just until blended. Fill greased muffin pans or 9-inch-square cake
pan two-thirds full. Bake in preheated 400-degree oven until pick inserted in
center comes out clean, 15 to 25 minutes for muffins, 30 to 35 minutes for

offers this to Mary Taylor of Livermore, who wants a recipe for a chocolate
ice box cake.; CHOCOLATE REFRIGERATOR CAKE; 1 4-ounce bar German sweet
chocolate; 1 5-ounce package vanilla pudding, not instant; 2 teaspoons instant
coffee; 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin; 2 cups milk; 2 cups whipped cream; 15

and stir until smooth. Cool completely and beat until smooth. Stir in 1 1/2
cups whipped cream. Line 8-by-4-by-3-inch loaf pan with waxed paper. Line
bottom and sides with halved lady fingers. Alternately add 2 layers each of
pudding and lady fingers. Chill 2 to 3 hours. Lift from pan, garnish with
remaining whipped cream and a handful of toasted almonds or walnuts. Makes 6
to 8 servings.; Calls for help; Santa Monaco of San Martin writes: "I would
like to know if anyone has a recipe for garlic paste made from fresh garlic.
And can it be frozen after making it?";   Elizabeth Nelson of Salinas writes:
"Many years ago when I was a student, a Sunday morning specialty was a
buckwheat, sourdough crepe recipe (very, very thin and very, very sour). It
was the specialty of the cook in a campus dorm. All I know is that she kept a
constantly fermenting starter in a large dorm refrigerator. With sweet syrup,
they were heavenly.";   Mrs. McGraw of San Jose requests two recipes: a
marinara sauce similar to the one served at the La Villa deli in Willow Glen
and a coleslaw like the one served at Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.  </TEXT>
