   Hershey Foods Corp. is introducing a powdered chocolate milk mix to compete against Ovaltine and Nestle's Quik in the $200 million powder-additive segment of the milk flavoring market. 

   The product, which took Hershey about three years to develop, will appear on most supermarket shelves by Sept. 11. 

   The company already dominates the syrup-additive part of the market, claiming about a 70% share of the segment, which has about $100 million in U.S. sales annually. 
Nestle S.A. claims about 10% of that segment. 

   Hershey hopes to capture a bigger portion of the powder segment, which Nestle dominates with a 70% share. 
But catching up to Nestle won't be easy. 
In the powder business, Hershey ranks a weak third, with only about 5% of the market. 
Sandoz Ltd.'s Ovaltine has about 10%. 

   Nestle "has a very strong lead," acknowledged Anthony J. Pingatore, general manager of Hershey's grocery products group. 

   Analysts said most consumers automatically associate the Hershey name with good chocolate. 
William J. Wason, a food industry analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., noted that Hershey's last venture into the field, a chocolate milk licensed through dairies, was a major success. 

   "This will be a nice plus for them outside of the candy area," he said, noting that having another Hershey-name product is "free advertising" for its candies. 

   Hershey launched a powder milk additive, Hershey Instant, in 1956. 
Consumers weren't particularly fond of its taste, and it didn't dissolve easily in cold milk. 
The company pulled it off the shelves in July to replace it with the new mix. 

   Albert F. Germann, Hershey's marketing manager, said the old product was "no better or worse than any other product on the market." 

   But the new milk mix will be pushed by the company as distinctly different from the rival brands, especially Nestle's. 
Hershey's consumer taste tests showed that the product has a more chocolatey and less sugary flavor. 

   Hershey hopes its packaging will provide advantages, too. 
The product comes in a plastic container with a wide mouth that can accommodate larger spoons. 
In contrast, Nestle's container is made of cardboard and has a narrow mouth, both unpopular features, according to Hershey consumer tests. 

   Mr. Germann said the media campaign planned for the new mix will be "the heaviest advertising Hershey has ever done for a new product," but he declined to disclose the size of the budget. 

   Humorous television commercials that run for 10 to 30 seconds will be aired beginning Sept. 11 over all major networks, cable and syndication. 
The commercials feature a herd of cows lowing, "It's Neeewww!" 

   Hershey also said it plans to distribute more than 100 million coupons in inserts in Sunday newspapers on Sept. 18. 
Next month, direct-mail packets with free samples of the mix will be sent to about 18 million U.S. households with children. 
And Hershey expects a number of national mass merchandisers, including K mart, will carry the product by November. 

   The company said it gave careful thought to the timing of the introduction. 
"Fall is the beginning of the high-consumption period for chocolate milk," Mr. Germann said, "primarily because it's back-to-school season."
