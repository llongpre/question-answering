<LEADPARA>  WHEN Mom told you to eat your vegetables, I have a feeling she didn't mean the
ones from Cocolat's garden. Delicious milk-chocolate carrots with shiny orange
skins come in cutesy wooden crates ($10.95 for 2.8 ounces). A bittersweet
chocolate pumpkin splits in half to reveal "seeds" of cocoa-dusted almonds
($13.95 for 4.5 ounces). Another peekaboo confection is the purple
foil-wrapped eggplant with milk and dark chocolate mini veggies ($13.95 for
4.5 ounces). And my favorite, two remarkably authentic-looking ears of corn
done in white and milk chocolate. The ears, wrapped in real corn husks, have a
slight crunch like Nestle's Crunch, but they're much better ($11.50 for three
ounces). Available at Cocolat stores throughout the Bay Area.;    With a name
like Food for the gods, it's logical the company should make a cookie dubbed
Zeus Supreme. More than just a cookie, as they say in their literature, it's
square and thick, like a brownie. But it tastes like a chocolate chip cookie
with dates and almonds mixed in. Very good. Other cookies include Apollo's
Gold (peanut butter, chocolate and walnuts) and Medusa's Stone (pecans,
coconut and chocolate). Cookies cost $8 and $8.50 a dozen. And Food for the
gods delivers. Call (408) 274-3857.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Chips Ahoy! Selections has two new cookies. Both try to straddle the line
between chewy soft and crisp. The result is a cookie which feels like it will
disintegrate before you finish it. Heath Toffee Chunk ($3.19 for 12 1/2
ounces) is made with the nuggets of that famous candy bar. It has a subtle
butterscotch flavor with nubbins of chocolate. I preferred it to the Chocolate
Chocolate Walnut ($3.19 for 12 1/2 ounces), which is flat.  </TEXT>
