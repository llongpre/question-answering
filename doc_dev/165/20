<LEADPARA>  MAIDA Heatter is the queen of tarts -- and pies and cakes. Ice cream and
cookies, too. And while you're at it, throw in mousses, puddings and poached
fruit.;    In fact, just about everything Maida Heatter makes is delicious.
But perhaps more important, recipes in each of her six dessert books work
perfectly (at least the ones I've tried, anyway). A fact that somehow
mystifies her.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A SWEET CONVERSATION WITH THE QUEEN OF DESSERTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I'm at a loss to explain it. I've never known any other way to do them,"
she said. "The funny thing is that when I started to do recipes, I didn't know
how. So I used Craig Claiborne's books as an example.";    Heatter and her
husband Ralph Daniels were in the Bay Area a while back plugging her most
recent book, "Maida Heatter's Best Dessert Book Ever" (Random House, $24.95).
Over breakfast at the Claremont Resort Hotel in Oakland, the silver-haired
(she won't reveal her age) and surprisingly thin (yes, she does eat her own
desserts) Heatter talked about how she became America's first lady of
desserts.;    "I asked Ralph if he would retire from being an airline pilot
and spend more time at home. I said, 'Why don't you open a coffee shop. I'll
make the brownies and you can schmooze with the guys.' ";    In addition to
brownies, Heatter made salad dressings and ratatouille ("raah taah too eee,"
she says with deliberation) in her home kitchen. Soon brownies gave way to
chocolate mousses, queen mother's cakes and "anything we could take in the
station wagon.";    When word of Heatter's wondrous confections spread beyond
her Miami Beach home, Claiborne, then food editor of the New York Times, came
to call. After a few samplings, he urged her to write a cookbook.;   
Fortunately for Heatter, that wasn't hard to do.;    "I used to write every
recipe in long hand to have a record for myself. Then I'd mimeograph 100
copies of each and Ralph would hand them out to customers to try out for
themselves. So by the time I was ready for my first book, I had the most
tested recipes you can imagine," she said.;    Her first book, "Maida
Heatter's Book of Great Desserts" (Alfred A. Knopf) came out in 1974. Despite
instant acclaim it and subsequent books received, Heatter never contracts for
a book until it is finished.;    When new dishes are perfected, she types the
recipe on a typewriter that sits next to the stove. Then she piles the typed
sheets on the floor of the dining room. When the pile gets to be about a foot
high, she knows it's time for a new book.;    Heatter fans take note: The
current pile is about six inches high.;    In the past 16 years Heatter has
become almost a folk hero for professional and amateur dessert makers alike.
Superstar chef Wolfgang Puck and Claiborne are two of her biggest admirers and
closest friends.;    (When I was a student at the Restaurant School in
Philadelphia in the mid '70s, making Heatter's Royal Viennese Walnut Torte was
de rigueur. And it seemed as if half the restaurants in town had at least one
Heatter dessert on the menu.);    In 1983 Heatter made key lime pie and
brownies for President Reagan when he hosted the economic summit in
Williamsburg, Va. In 1988 she was named to Cook's Magazine Who's Who of
Cooking in America.;    Though her mother was an excellent home cook (her
father was famed broadcaster Gabriel Heatter), Heatter gives most of the
credit for her dessert deftness to the 20 years she spent as a fashion
illustrator in New York.;    "When I'm in the kitchen, I'm amazed at how many
times I make a dessert that relates to a design class I took. In school, I
learned balance, proportion and center of interest. If I knew anything about
music, I'd say it relates to food too. But the fact is, I'm tone deaf," she
said.;    In the past decade, Heatter has seen two significant changes in
dessert making. The first is a move away from ornate and elaborate desserts to
ones that are simpler and more straightforward. The second trend is desserts
with more intense flavors.;    "Now I use more of everything in my recipes
whether it's rum, chocolate or vanilla. I hate to say it, but I have a vanilla
ice cream in one of my other books that is blah compared to the one in my
current book because now I use Tahitian vanilla beans, and more of them," she
said.;    She also has become fond of using pepper in desserts to jack up the
taste. A number of the desserts in her new book contain finely ground white or
black pepper.;    "Something happens when you combine sugar and pepper if you
use the right amount. The pepper seems to bring out the flavor without getting
in the way," she said.;    The trend toward simplicity suits Heatter just
fine. When asked for her favorite dessert she quickly responds, "chocolate ice
cream." And she admits to being "totally charmed" by a plain loaf cake.;   
But what really turns Heatter on is just making desserts, any desserts, in the
spacious kitchen (it occupies an entire wing) of her waterfront home.;   
"Seeing my name in the New York Times or in the window of Saks doesn't do a
thing for me. I'm never prouder than when I take something out of the oven.";
HONEY BISCOTTI;  7 ounces (1 3/4 cups) whole unblanched (skins-on) almonds;  3
large eggs;  1/2 cup mild and light honey;  1 teaspoon vanilla extract;  1/2
teaspoon almond extract or 1/4 teaspoon bitter almond extract;  3 cups plus 1
tablespoon sifted unbleached flour;  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder;  1/4
teaspoon salt;  1 1/4 teaspoons white pepper, ground fine;  1 1/4 teaspoons
ground ginger;  1/2 cup granulated sugar;   Heat oven to 375; bake almonds in
wide, shallow pan, in oven center, stirring once, for 13 minutes. Set aside to
cool.;    Adjust two racks to divide oven into thirds and reduce temperature
to 300. Line two 12-by-15 1/2-inch cookie sheets with baking pan liner paper
or aluminum foil, shiny side up, and set aside. Beat eggs in a small bowl with
honey and vanilla and almond extracts to mix well; set aside.;    Sift
together flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, ginger and sugar into large bowl
of an electric mixer. Add beaten egg mixture all at once to dry ingredients
and beat on low speed, scraping bowl as necessary with rubber spatula, until
mixture holds together. Slowly beat in nuts. Mixture will be thick, gooey and
rubbery.;    Lightly flour large work surface and turn dough onto floured
area. Lightly sift flour over top of dough. Cut dough in half. With wide dough
scraper (or with wide spatula or pancake turner), turn one piece of dough few
times to flour lightly all sides and form dough into elongated oval about 10
inches long. Place lined cookie sheet next to oval of dough.;    Now is when
you need confidence. Dough will be soft and will lose shape when you transfer
it. (If you use more flour and make a dough that will hold its shape, it will
be too firm to spread out as it should during baking.) With both hands (or
with the dough scraper) pick up dough and quickly transfer to cookie sheet,
placing it diagonally on the sheet. However the dough flops on the sheet, it
will be OK. Reshape with your fingers and/or press dough scraper against sides
of dough to straighten shape. (It should be only about 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide
in middle and 1/2 to 3/4 inch high.);    Repeat with remaining half of dough
and second cookie sheet. With wide pastry brush, brush excess flour off dough.
Bake two sheets at a time for 50 minutes, reversing sheets top to bottom and
front to back once during baking to ensure even browning. (The shapes will
flatten and spread.);    Remove sheets from oven. Reduce temperature to 275.
Peel paper away from back, or with large spatula, or using flat-sided cookie
sheet as a spatula, release baked strips and transfer to large cutting board.;
   Cutting strips into narrow finger shapes should be done slowly and
carefully. With a serrated bread knife, cut strips on a sharp angle into
cookies 1/2 inch wide. Sometimes it is best to start each cut with serrated
knife and finish with a straight knife.;    Place them on a cut side, next to
each other, and bake again for 35 to 45 minutes (depending on width). After
about 20 minutes, or when cookies are half baked, turn upside down and bake
until dry. Watch carefully; do not over bake. (While they are warm, they will
feel a bit soft, but when they cool they will become crisp and hard.) They
should be golden brown all over but not look burned. Cool and store airtight.
Makes about 40.; DOUBLE CHOCOLATE POTS DE CREME;  1 pound semisweet or
bittersweet chocolate;  2 cups milk;  1 tablespoon dry instant espresso or
coffee;   Pinch of salt;  6 large egg yolks;  1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract;
  Chop chocolate fine and set aside. In large heavy saucepan over moderate
heat, stir milk occasionally until it just barely starts to boil. Add
chocolate and whisk until smooth. Add the espresso or coffee and salt and wisk
until mixture just comes to boil again.;    Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat yolks
just to mix. Ladle the boiling mixture slowly into yolks, beating on low speed
only to mix. Mix in the vanilla. The mixture should be as smooth as honey;
pour hot mixture through a fine strainer into pitcher.;    Pour into 10 pots
de creme cups or 8 souffle dishes, demitasse cups or wine glasses.;   
Refrigerate uncovered for about half an hour only until chilled, and then
cover and refrigerate a few hours longer (3 to 4 hours minimum) or until the
next day. (If not covered, a skin will form on the top.);    Serve with a
small spoonful of soft whipped cream on each portion, with a light sprinkle of
unsweetened cocoa powder over cream.; GREEN APPLE ICE;  1 1/2 pounds (4
medium-large) tart apples (preferably Granny Smith);  1 cup unsweetened apple
juice;  1 cup granulated sugar;  2 teaspoons lemon juice;  1 teaspoon vanilla
extract;   Calvados or applejack, optional;   Peel the apples with a vegetable
parer. Cut them in half from the top to bottom. With a melon baller remover
the cores. With a small sharp knife cut a small groove above and below the
cores to remove the stems and fibers. Cut each piece in half, making quarters.
Place in a heavy saucepan with the apple juice and sugar.;    Cover and cook
over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes or until
tender.;    With a slotted spoon transfer the apples to the bowl of a food
processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Process until pureed. Through
the feed tube gradually add the syrup remaining in the saucepan, and process
until smooth.;    Strain through a wide but fine strainer set over a bowl.
Stir in the lemon juice and vanilla. Cool.;    Chill, preferably in the
refrigerator for a few hours or overnight.;    Freeze in an ice cream churn
according to the manufacturer's directions.;    If you wish, serve with a bit
of the optional Calvados or applejack spooned over the top.  </TEXT>
