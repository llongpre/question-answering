   Low-fat cheeses, all-fruit jams and low-calorie
crackers are making inroads in the fancy foods industry, and
health-conscious eaters can find satisfaction in the gourmet
section if they look carefully.
   ``All-natural'' was a common rallying cry as purveyers showed
off 20,000 foods at the 36th Annual International Fancy Food and
Confection Show last week. But even if all-natural, which generally
has no legal meaning, most of the samples spread out for potential
customers were more likely to be buttery or chocolatey than
slimming.
   ``People are trying to eat healthy most of the time,'' said
Ronald Tanner, spokesman for the National Association for the
Specialty Food Trade Inc. ``And then when they're splurging,
they're really splurging.''
   Most of the time, people who buy fancier foods try to satisfy
their urges with foods that carry rich flavors but at little cost
to the waistline.
   ``Flavor is the real big selling point. People want to eat
healthy, but they don't want to just eat lettuce,'' Tanner said.
   For the first time, this year's trade show included a seminar on
healthy foods.
   So, there are mustards _ green chili mustard, sage mustard, wine
and champagne mustards, sweet mustards. And wild rice. Organic
baked beans. Oats added to pancake mixes. Organically grown teas.
Goat's milk yogurt. Organic maple syrup. Eleven-calorie cookies.
   But just as in the supermarket, consumers should read labels at
gourmet shops. Organic doesn't mean low-calorie, and
cholesterol-free doesn't mean no fat. A sugar-free product may have
as many calories as one with sugar.
   Le Slim Cow, a butter substitute made with buttermilk, was
promoted as having half the fat of butter or margarine. And just 57
calories, compared with 103 calories per serving of butter.
However, its makers, St. Hubert of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.,
warn that the high moisture content of Le Slim Cow makes it
unsuitable for frying.
   Elan Foods Inc. has introduced a chocolate-covered frozen yogurt
bar that's available east of the Mississippi and should be
available nationwide in a year or so, said Joanne Biltekoff, who
runs the company with her husband.
   While a bar has 230 calories and 13 grams of fat, a premium ice
cream bar has 350 calories and 22 fat grams.
   Salsas and chile sauces were plentiful at the show _ San Angel,
La Preferida, Montezuma, Corn Mother red and green salsas, one made
with eggplant, one with dried tomatoes, one from Canada.
   Generally, these have little fat, though eating them with
tortilla chips cancels any advantage. Try them with bread or
vegetables instead.
   The Baker brand of breads includes varieties made from
stone-ground grains, but the company's booth also included rich
brownies. And a Vermont company called Food 2000 offered vegetarian
chili. There were organic vegetable pates from Threefold
International Co. Ltd. in carrot, chestnut, mushroom and other
flavors.
   But temptation lurked everywhere.
   Across the aisle from Golightly sugar-free candies was a big pan
of tiramisu, the Italian dessert made with high-fat cheese.
   Walk down another aisle and go from butter cookies to spicy meat
to potato pancakes. Pates seemed to be everywhere. And chocolate.
Chocolate shaped like hair dryers, chocolate with every kind of nut
imaginable, chocolate sauce, chocolate cookies, even
chocolate-covered caramel corn.
