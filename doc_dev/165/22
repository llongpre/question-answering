<LEADPARA>  WHAT could be a more simple dessert for the holidays than buttery shortbread?
This Scottish treat is a basic trinity of butter, sugar and flour that was
created as a delicacy generations ago.;   The simplicity of the mixture makes
it perfect for numerous holiday variations. Merely add flavorings, raisins,
fruit peel or nuts to the basic recipe, or take it a step further by altering
the shape of the shortbread.  </LEADPARA>
