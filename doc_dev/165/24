<TEXT>     Why all this warm and fuzzy talk about a food that's ice cold? It's because
gelato, the Italian word for ice cream, is justly famous for the intensity of
its flavors.;    When you wrap your lips around a spoonful of peach gelato,
chances are you'll say, "Now that's peach!" not "This has a nice peachy
flavor.";    Gelato is a word used for both ice cream and water ice, but
strictly speaking it's an ice cream -- a mixture of egg custard, sugar and
other flavorings -- while a water ice is a sorbetto.;    A characteristic of
the best gelati made in Naples and Palermo is the addition of a second flavor
to bring out the aroma of the main ingredients, such as a hint of orange in
the strawberry gelato or a pinch of cinnamon in the chocolate.;    The
following recipes provide a flavorful primer for this dessert. Some are based
on smooth fruit purees, and some are made with chunks of fruit, nuts or
candy.;    In fruit-based gelati, ripeness is important in bringing out the
best flavor. Choose fruit that is soft and fragrant.;    Chocolate-Hazelnut
Gelato gets its intense flavor from roasted, ground nuts and Frangelico, the
hazelnut liqueur, plus melted semisweet chocolate.;    Cappuccino Gelato is
made with instant espresso and Kahlua.;    Lemon Gelato, a refreshing treat
for hot summer nights, is flavored with fresh lemon juice and finely grated
lemon peel.;    Banana-Honey Gelato gets a flavor accent from lemon juice.;   
Peach Gelato combines peaches, Grand Marnier liqueur, orange juice and lemon
juice.;    Dried Cherry-Chocolate Chunk Gelato uses half a cup of cherries and
a 3-ounce bar of semisweet chocolate per eight servings.;    To make gelato,
you need an ice cream machine. If you don't own one, these recipes and the
potential for grins on the faces of your family and guests are reason enough
to consider making the investment.; CHOCOLATE-HAZELNUT; GELATO;  1 cup
hazelnuts;  6 egg yolks;  1 1/3 cups whipping cream;  1/8 teaspoon salt;  2
cups half-and-half;  3/4 cup sugar;  4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
into 1/2-inch pieces;  2 tablespoons Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur);   Place
the hazelnuts in a cake pan and toast in a preheated 350-degree oven 10
minutes, or until the skins start to crack. Cool slightly; place in a kitchen
towel and rub together to remove the skins. Grind finely in a food processor.;
   In a large bowl whisk together the egg yolks, cream and salt. Combine the
half-and-half and sugar in a saucepan. Bring the liquid to a simmer, add the
chocolate and cover. Remove from the heat and set aside 5 minutes, or until
the chocolate has melted.;    Slowly whisk the hot chocolate mixture into the
egg yolk mixture, then return to the saucepan. Stir over medium heat until the
mixture begins to thicken slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 7
minutes. Let cool.;    Stir in the ground nuts and the hazelnut liqueur.
Refrigerate until completely chilled.;    Transfer the mixture to an ice cream
machine and freeze according to manufacturer's directions. Makes 10 servings.;
