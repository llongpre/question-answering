   Shortly after noon on the second day of the
National Candy Wholesalers Association's summer convention, sugar
shock hit and the guy in the big M&amp;M costume started to look fuzzy.
   No thanks, no mas, enough already. No more chocolate bars,
gumdrops, gumballs, rock candy, licorice sticks, fudge, toffee
crunch, jelly beans, peppermint creams, caramel-coated popcorn,
Moon Pies or Mellow-Munchies.
   Take away your heart-shaped Valentine's Day boxes, your Count
Dracula treats for Halloween, your chocolate Easter bunnies. Get
thee hence, Garbage Can-dy, Heavenly Passion and Pee-Wee's
Playhouse Fun Paks.
   Glucose levels were going through the roof of the Washington
Convention Center when the semiannual confab of 6,500 candy
wholesalers got into full swing Thursday. At midday, sales people
began tempting passersby with heaps of sweets, chewing gum and
munchies at 630 booths covering the floors of two large exhibition
halls.
   Other conventioneers swarmed through the ``sample room'' filling
small paper tote bags with goodies while a tape-recorded voice
repeatedly urged guests to exercise restraint. ``Thank you, and
have a sweet tooth,'' the voice said.
   The hottest items on the market this year seem to be gummy bears
_ a chewy confection long popular among European children _ upscale
``gourmet'' chocolates from such exotic locales as Belgium, and
bubble gum that looks like pizza, served in a tiny Domino's Pizza
box.
   For the health-conscious, there is tofu chocolate (``non-dairy,
no white sugar, no cholesterol''), granola bars and ``high-fiber''
candies coated with yogurt.
   For those who don't care, there are white chocolate lollipops in
the shape of big-bosomed blondes and ``shelf-stable'' cotton candy
in cardboard Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus wagons.
   Licorice comes in vines, ropes and twists. Popcorn comes in
barbecue, nacho and jalapeno flavors. Kids' candies come in toy
light bulbs, water pistols, skeletons, skulls, rockets, whistles,
snakes, UFOs, spaceships and parachute jumpers.
   Two of the oldest candy brands in America _ both introduced in
1912 _ are still on the market, according to industry historians.
They are the Nut Goodie bar, made by Pearson's of St. Paul, Minn.,
and the Goo Goo Cluster manufactured by Standard Candy Co. of
Nashville, Tenn.
   Association president Ernest D. May, a candy packager and
distributor from Grove City, Pa., said the $9.6 billion candy
business is growing steadily after a slump in the 1970s caused
partly by high sugar prices and a stagnant population in the
biggest candy-buying age bracket, 15 to 30.
   Consumption had risen to 19.3 pounds of candy per capita last
year, and May says the wholesalers' goal is 25 pounds for every
American man, woman and child by 1995.
   ``It's a real challenge but I think it's reachable,'' May said
in an interview. ``The future is bright.''
   After gummy bears, what fantastic new candy treat is next?
   ``If I could answer that,'' he replied, ``you and I could both
retire.''
