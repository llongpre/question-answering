   Every dog has its day, and a Tokyo retailer is
hoping that day is Valentine's Day.
   The Tokyu Department Store is going all out this year to make
sure its pet-owning customers have a vast array chocolates,
cookies, fish sausages and other drool-inducing delicacies to
choose from.
   ``I'm buying chocolates for my boyfriend, so why not for my
dog?'' said Ayako Endo, a 22-year-old office worker.
   Miss Endo said buying a $3.50 gift set of goodies was the least
she could do for her 12-year-old English setter.
   ``They're good,'' she said. ``I eat them too.''
   As in the United States, Japanese celebrate Valentine's Day by
giving sweets to a loved one. Tokyu is hoping to expand the concept
a bit to include animals.
   ``We've been selling the chocolates for about three years, but
this is the first year we have gone all out,'' said Tokyu pet shop
clerk Yoshiko Kashiwazaki, pointing to a large table covered with
heart-shaped gift sets wrapped in red-and-yellow ribbons.
   A poster showed two furry creatures cuddled up over the slogan:
``For Lovers, Sweet Valentine.''
   ``I love you only,'' said one. ``Me too,'' replied the other.
   Shoppers are eating up the idea.
   ``I just love cats and dogs,'' said 12-year-old Yuki Kuwahara,
who bought a chocolate and chew-bone gift for a Maltese dog she's
rather fond of. ``We don't have a pet of our own.''
   Most of the customers who purchase sweets for their dogs are
women in their 30s or 40s, Kashiwazaki said.
   The chocolates come in both the regular brown and milky white
colors, ``contain 13 different vitamins and are made with only the
purest milk,'' according to Morinyu Pet Foods, the company that
makes them.
   Morinyu, a subsidiary of the huge Morinaga Milk Industry Co.,
Ltd., began producing the chocolates six years ago, intending them
to be used as rewards given to show dogs during training.
   But Tokyu, which sells a variety of gourmet pet foods, decided
to open the pet Valentine corner because sales of the chocolates
had increased each year in mid-February, Kashiwazaki said.
   ``As far as I know we're the only department store doing this,''
said Masataka Tajima of Tokyu's Sales Promotions Department.
   Hundreds of thousands of chocolates are sold for Valentine's Day
in Japan each year. The chocolates are given by women to men, who
often return the favor on March 14, which is known as ``White
Chocolate Day.''
