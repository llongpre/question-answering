<LEADPARA>  Two frosty, cold glasses of milk: one plain, one chocolate. Which would you
choose?;   OK. Would you give up the chocolate milk for a gooey candy bar? For
an apple?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The dairy industry figures the choice is between the milk and the candy
bar. At least that'll be how they pitch a new national advertising campaign
aimed at persuading children and teen-agers to drink more chocolate milk.;  
But dentists and consumer advocates worry about the cavities: chocolate milk
contains sugar as well as cocoa.;   "Chocolate milk is a beverage with a
uniquely satisfying, chocolately taste that's a fun break from other types of
snacks and beverages," said George de Jager, head of the marketing and
advertising department for the National Dairy Board.;   And that will be the
message in an advertising campaign to begin in mid-March by the members of the
Milk Work Group, which includes the National Dairy Board and other state and
regional dairy organizations, the board said.;   But a spokesman for the
American Dental Association said it's the wrong message to be sending
children, whose teeth are more vulnerable to decay and cavities than adults.; 
 "Personally, I would not recommend my patients get on chocolate milk. You've
got to lace it with a bunch of stuff to make it sweet, and that's going to
cause a lot of trouble," said Dr. Heber Simmons, a pediatric dentist in
Jackson, Miss.;   Despite his own reservations, Simmons said a glass of
chocolate milk at meal times shouldn't be a problem. It's between-meal snacks
on sugary foods or drinks that are the biggest decay threat.;   "Teeth do real
well for three meals; in-between snacking gets everyone in trouble," Simmons
said Monday.;   And once children start drinking chocolate milk, Simmons said,
they may refuse to drink anything else, especially plain white milk.;  
Simmons instead recommends children snack on cheddar cheese, which contains a
decay-inhibitor; popcorn or fresh fruit.  </TEXT>
