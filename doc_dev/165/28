   Britain's top two confectioners, Cadbury Schweppes
PLC and Kit Kat-maker Rowntree PLC, have become tempting targets
for U.S. and Swiss bidders in what the British have dubbed the
candy bar wars.
   The bidding and stake-building reflect a trend among consumer
companies to go global by acquiring existing, strong brands, which
are almost prohibitively expensive to create from scratch, analysts
say.
   The moves also reflect Swiss companies' concerns about the
approach of 1992, when the Common Market is to become one
barrier-free market of 320 million consumers.
   Because Switzerland is not a member, Swiss companies are eager
to buy operations within the 12-nation European Community, said
Felicity Smith, an analyst with the London investment firm Hoare
Govett Ltd.
   The candy bar wars also underscore the key roles Cadbury and
Rowntree play in the industry and the importance of Britain as a
confectionery market.
   The two companies rank among the world's largest
chocolate-makers, as do the Swiss suitors for Rowntree, Nestle S.A.
and Jacobs Suchard S.A.
   The American company General Cinema Corp., which said it wants
to increase its stake in Cadbury, has interests in movie theaters
and soft drink bottling.
   In Britain _ the third-largest chocolate consuming country in
the world after Switzerland and Norway _ Cadbury has the largest
share of the $3.9 billion chocolate market, or 30 percent,
according to the London brokerage firm Henderson Crosthwaite Ltd.
   Rowntree comes in a second with 26 percent, and U.S.-based Mars
Inc. is third with 24 percent, the firm said.
   Cadbury's brands also include Canada Dry soft drinks.
   Many Britons are not happy that two of their venerable
institutions are being raided by foreigners.
   ``The fate of the (Rowntree) Yorkie bar has stirred the nation
into a fit of patriotism,'' the Daily Telegraph newspaper said.
``The Little English lobby has been in a lather...''
   Rowntree hasn't made a direct approach to the government about
possible intervention, but it is discussing the matter with ``one
or two people,'' a Rowntree spokesman said on Tuesday.
   In accordance with British practice, the spokesman wasn't
identified.
   In Cadbury's case, General Cinema, which is headquartered in
Chestnut Hill, Mass., said last week that it would increase its
17.7 percent stake in the British company, possibly through a
tender offer.
   London-based Cadbury, whose brands include Peter Paul's Mounds
and Almond Joy candy bars, said any involvement or interference
from General Cinema would be ``unwelcome, and strongly resisted.''
   It was more than a year ago that General Cinema first became a
major shareholder in Cadbury, whose shares fell 15 cents to finish
at $6.51 on London's Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Rowntree, which is based in York, England, last week
became the reluctant target of a hostile, $3.9 billion bid from
Nestle, the world's largest food company with interests in
chocolate and coffee.
   Nestle, which has acquired almost 7 percent of Rowntree, offered
$16.64 a share for the company, which rejected the bid.
   The offer from Nestle _ whose brands include Nestle's Crunch _
is said to be the largest by a non-British bidder for a British
company. Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland, also recently reached
an agreement to acquire the Buitoni SpA foods group, including its
Perugina chocolates business, from Italian businessman Carlo de
Benedetti.
   Separately, competing suitor Jacobs Suchard, another Swiss
company with chocolate and coffee interests, has amassed a 21
percent stake in Rowntree, which didn't welcome that move, either.
   Zurich-based Jacobs Suchard, which makes the triangular
Toblerone chocolate bars, initially paid $11.78 a share for its
Rowntree shares.
   Rowntree's shares finished at $17.30, up nine cents, on Tuesday.
   Nestle currently has a 3 percent share and Suchard, 2 percent,
of the British chocolate market.
   ``What it is all about is globalization of consumer products
markets,'' said David Lang, a food analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.
   ``You have the multinational companies at the moment trying to
accumulate tremendous brand strength in a narrow product line, but
internationally.''
   Lang added: ``The scramble for shelf space is some of it and the
big brands are the only ones that can get it.''
   ``Satellite advertising and international travel are creating a
greater homogenization,'' Lang said. ``The supermarket shelves of
the world are starting to look like one another.''
   Rowntree, which traces its origins back to a Quaker grocer's
shop in York, northeast England, in the 18th century, had pre-tax
profit of $210 million on sales of $2.67 billion in 1987.
   Cadbury, which began as a seller of tea and coffee in Birmingham
in 1824, had pre-tax profit of $329 million on revenue of $3.8
billion last year.
