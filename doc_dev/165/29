<LEADPARA>  IN 1916, the Campbell Soup Co. published "Help for the Hostess," a booklet of
cooking-with-soup recipes. This was one of the earliest (if not the first)
examples of what has become a major branch of modern American cookery, not to
mention product promotion.;    Today more than 80 percent of the 325 million
cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup produced annually by Campbell's are used for
sauces, which pretty much defines back-of-the-box success.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Test kitchens such as those at Kellogg's and General Foods still produce
hundreds of recipes a year (always hoping for another enduring classic), and
millions of us still reach for the recipe printed on the box even before we
reach for knife, bowl or pan.;    Why, after nearly 30 years, are we still
stirring up Lipton's Famous California Dip? What is it, after 50 years, that
still leads us to crave Rice Krispies Treats? Why, even though the recipe is
60 years old, is it possible to find Toll House Cookie crumbs among the keys
of my word processor?;    These are tough questions. Scientists have disproved
the secret addictive substance theory, stating categorically that there is
nothing slipped into these simple, tasty recipes that causes us to begin
hungering for another batch at precisely the same moment the next semitrailer
load of the main ingredient arrives at our neighborhood supermarket.;    So,
if not narcotic, how about nostalgic?;    There is something uniquely American
about the belief that time saved in the kitchen is time that can be used to;
otherwise improve our quality of life. While it would be risky to credit
something like canned soup with the beginnings of women's liberation, it's
true that when Mom took off her apron and went to work outside the home, more
and more meals came from the back of the box.;    For many members of a
generation (or two), such speedy cuisine now constitutes "home cooking," and
when times are tough, it's easy for us to wax nostalgic about bar cookies made
from little more than melted marshmallows and crisp rice cereal. (For most of
the rest of America, it should be noted, back-of-the-box cooking isn't
nostalgic at all -- it's reality, there being even less time to spend in the
kitchen nowadays than there was when the Rice Krispies Treat was young.);   
For both the nostalgic and the merely hungry, certain back- of-the-box
classics have emerged over the years. Green Bean Bake, Toll House Cookies and
Lipton California Dip are still with us because they are so good, so easy and
so right.;    You might say the sour cream rises to the top.;    Famous onion
dip;    Who has not at one time succumbed to the hypnotic pleasure of this
way-of-life-in-a-bowl, with chips? It may seem as if America has been whipping
up this dip for centuries but, in fact, it's a relatively new back-of-the-box
formula that first appeared on Lipton's Onion Recipe Soup Mix, circa 1963.;   
When my pajama-clad brothers and I were small, huddled at the top of the
stairs listening to mysterious adult partying below, "onion dip" seemed the
height of grown-up sophistication. Later, when the three of us were allowed to
hold our own ersatz parties while our parents were away at the real thing, the
dip (plus smoked oysters, olives and cubes of Cheddar cheese on toothpicks,
washed down with 7UP) was always on the menu.;  THE FAMOUS LIPTON CALIFORNIA;
DIP RECIPE; 1 envelope Lipton Onion Recipe Soup Mix; 1 pint (16 ounces) sour
cream;   Blend Lipton Onion Recipe Soup Mix with sour cream in bowl. For
creamier dip, add more sour cream. Cover and chill. Makes about 2 cups.;   
Gilding the lily: While the point of any back-of-the-box recipe is speed,
letting the dip chill for a couple of hours or so and stirring it occasionally
will result in a smoother, better-tasting dip. The terminally hasty can speed
things up by stirring in 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk or cream.; (hbox);   
Ketchup in, and ketchup on, keeps the meat loaf moist and flavorful. This
classic from Heinz also includes an odd but tasty touch of pineapple, which is
especially nice if you include a bit of ground pork in place of some of the
beef.;  RED MAGIC MEAT LOAF; 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef; 1 cup soft bread
crumbs;  1/3 cup plus 1/4 cup Heinz Tomato Ketchup;  1/4 cup chopped onion; 1
egg, slightly beaten;  1/2 teaspoon salt;  1/8 teaspoon pepper;  1/4 cup
drained crushed pineapple;   Combine beef, bread crumbs, 1/3 cup ketchup,
onion, egg, salt and pepper in large bowl. Mix well. Form mixture into 8-by-4-
by-1 1/2-inch loaf and place in greased shallow baking pan. Bake at 350
degrees for 40 minutes. Remove from oven.;    Combine remaining 1/4 cup
ketchup with pineapple and spoon over top of loaf. Bake an additional 30
minutes. Let meat loaf stand 5 minutes before slicing. Makes 6 servings.;   
Gilding the lily: This meat loaf could use a touch more pepper. Also you can
replace about 1/3 of the beef with ground pork (not too lean, not too fat) for
a moister, better-tasting result.; (hbox);    This is it -- one of the seven
most popular Campbell Kitchens product recipes ever, chosen from a field of
more than 16,000, and perhaps the quintessential back-of-the-box formula. For
a generation or two of potluck suppers, church socials and other communal
gatherings, this uncomplicated casserole was easily the most familiar dish on
the table. As noted earlier, 80 percent of the Cream of Mushroom Soup that
Campbell's sells every year is used in sauces, most, I'll wager, in this
classic vegetable side dish.;  CLASSIC GREEN BEAN BAKE; 1 10 3/4-ounce can
Campbell's Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup;  1/2 cup milk; 1 teaspoon soy
sauce;  Dash pepper; 4 cups cooked green beans (see note); 1 2.8-ounce can
french-fried onions;   Combine undiluted soup, milk, soy sauce and pepper in 1
1/2- quart casserole. Stir in green beans and 1/2 can onions. Bake at 350
degrees 25 minutes or until hot. Stir. Top with remaining onions and bake 5
minutes more. Makes 8 servings.;    Note: Buy 2 9-ounce packages frozen cut
green beans (thawed and cooked) or 2 16-ounce cans cut green beans (drained)
or about 1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, cooked, for this recipe.;    Gilding
the lily: For a crunchier texture, substitute French-cut green beans, thawed
and drained but otherwise uncooked. Shoestring potato sticks (do they still
exist?), sliced almonds, packaged croutons or cubes of fresh white bread can
be used on top of -- but not stirred into -- the beans. Add them about halfway
through the cooking process and bake until lightly browned.; (hbox);    Unlike
most of the best-known back-of-the-box recipes, this all-American cookie
classic began long ago and far away from any corporate test kitchen. In 1930,
at the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Mass., Ruth Wakefield chopped a milk
chocolate bar into chunks and stirred them into a batch of dough for her
Butter Drop-Dos. She assumed that during the baking the chocolate would melt
and mix throughout the dough. She wanted chocolate cookies. What she got were
chocolate chunk cookies.;    With typical New England frugality, she served
them anyway, and the cookies were a hit. She renamed them Chocolate Crispies,
and when the recipe appeared in a Boston newspaper, regional sales of
chocolate bars boomed. The chocolate maker (Nestle) responded by producing a
small tool designed to cut chocolate bars into chunks and then turned out a
chocolate bar already scored to break apart into small bits.;    Such moments
of food destiny can only be appreciated in retrospect. Who can imagine a world
without chocolate chip cookies? Without Mrs. Fields and Famous Amos? What, no
Keebler elves?;    Fortunately, Nestle bowed to the inevitable with
commendable mercenary grace, and in 1939 bought the Toll House name and began
manufacturing the semisweet chocolate "morsels" we bake today.;    After 40
years (and uncounted tons of warm cookies washed down with untold gallons of
ice-cold milk), Nestle's original agreement with the Toll House Inn expired.
They were now allowed to alter the original recipe and did so slightly,
eliminating the direction to sift the flour, omitting the tiny amount of water
called for, shortening the baking time by two minutes and omitting the need to
grease the baking sheets.;    These minute changes were in response to modern
ingredients and modern impatience to cut to the chase -- in this case, a
molten chipper snarfed straight from the cookie sheet. Tampering with a
successful back-of-the-box formula is a tricky business, akin to omitting one
altogether, but for the most part Nestle's changes have been well received. A
few crotchety duffers (I among them) insist the original original makes the
better cookie. Here it is.;  THE ORIGINAL ORIGINAL TOLL HOUSE COOKIES; 1 cup
plus 2 tablespoons sifted flour;  1/2 teaspoon baking soda;  1/2 teaspoon
salt;  1/2 cup butter, softened, or shortening; 6 tablespoons granulated
sugar; 6 tablespoons brown sugar, packed;  1/2 teaspoon vanilla;  1/4 teaspoon
water; 1 egg; 1 package (1 cup) Nestle Toll House Semi-Sweet Chocolate
Morsels;  1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts;   Sift together flour, baking soda
and salt in bowl and set aside. Combine in separate bowl butter, granulated
and brown sugars, vanilla and water. Beat until creamy. Beat in egg. Add flour
mixture and mix well. Stir in chocolate morsels and walnuts. Drop by
well-rounded half teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees
10 to 12 minutes. Makes 50 cookies.; (hbox);    There can be no denying the
easy appeal of a cookie or bar that requires no baking. This back-of-the-box
favorite, developed in the 1940s, has long been a staple in houses where
ravenous kids, sudden company or midnight hungries disrupt otherwise well-laid
plans. As with many of the most enduring and effective back-of-the-box
formulas, it almost seems as if these treats have usurped the original purpose
of the product in question. I know there must be people who eat Rice Krispies
for breakfast, but who and where are they? Three ingredients (good keepers
all), two pans and about five minutes of work are all it takes to create this
sweet, spontaneous snack.;  RICE KRISPIES TREATS; 2 1/4 cup margarine or
butter; 1 10-ounce package (about 40) regular marshmallows or 4 cups miniature
marshmallows (use fresh marshmallows for best results); 6 cups Kellogg's Rice
Krispies cereal;   Melt margarine in large saucepan over low heat. Add
marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat. Add cereal,
stirring until well coated.;    Using buttered spatula or waxed paper, press
mixture evenly into buttered 13-by-9-by-2-inch pan. Cut into 2-inch squares.
Makes 24 squares.;    Gilding the Lily: Stir 1 cup raisins or 1 cup peanuts
(or a combination) into the mixture along with the cereal. Stir 1/4 cup peanut
butter into the marshmallow mixture just before adding the cereal.  </TEXT>
