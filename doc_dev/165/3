<LEADPARA>  I DON'T use the term addictive too often, but Rippa Baci di Dama cookies fall
into that category. The only thing that keeps you from consuming mass
quantities in record time is that these cute numbers are individually wrapped
-- for your protection, you might say.;    The cookies (the name means lady's
kisses) look like miniature hamburger buns with a thin chocolate filling.
They're not cheap, but that's probably a good thing. Prices range from 40
cents to 75 cents for individual cookies and $8 to $10 for half-pound sacks.
Get them at the Gourmet Giraffe in Los Gatos, Caffe Classico in Campbell, The
Coffee Roasting Club in Morgan Hill and Gilroy, Continental Deli in Aptos and
La Villa, Villa Lanza and Marco's, all in San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  (hbox);    The biscotti wars continue. After writing about biscotti a few
weeks ago, I've been flooded with biscotti from all over the South Bay.;   
Venice Biscotti are made in Los Altos. All three varieties have what I call a
good crunch factor -- crunchy enough to hold up under dunking, but not so hard
that you feel as if you were high tackled by Ronnie Lott.;    The amaretto
contain almonds and a subtle flavor of amaretto. Chocolate has that classic
veneer of chocolate on the side. Anisette has a depth charge anise flavor that
continued to mushroom long after I finished munching. I felt as if I had
swallowed a bottle of sambuca.;    Venice Biscotti are sold nationwide and are
available locally at Draeger's in Los Altos, Whole Foods in Palo Alto and
Gene's Quito Market in Saratoga.;    Sheila Weisberg makes low- and no-fat
biscotti in her San Jose home. I liked the low-fat (no shortening but with
nuts or chocolate) better than the no-fat, which I found dry and hard. An
eight-ounce bag sells for $7, and you can mix flavors. No-fat comes in
cinnamon-spice, with and without raisins, vanilla, lemon and anisette. Low-fat
comes in chocolate-nut, orange-almond, chocolate dipped and chocolate
chocolate chip. If you live within a reasonable distance, Weisberg will
deliver. Call (408) 741-0232.;    Finally, (I hope) a Los Gatos company called
Biscotti di Nonna, not to be confused with Nonni's biscotti in San Francisco,
sent me its biscotti. The plain has a hint of anise. It's very nutty and
slightly chewy, rather than crisp and dry. The chocolate-coated (on one side)
version is crisper and slightly dry. Have this one with a cappuccino and hold
the powdered cocoa.;    The only problem is that I lost the company's business
card and there is no listing for Biscotti di Nonna in the telephone directory.
So if you're still out there, Biscotti di Nonna, let us here from you.  </TEXT>
