A flood of letters overwhelms The Times Food Section this time of year with 
requests for making ahead and mailing edible gifts to loved ones both near and 
far. There's something extra special about gifts of food -- they show 
thoughtfulness and are the perfect addition to a holiday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Foods that freeze well, such as quick breads and muffins, or those that require 
no refrigeration, such as cookies, candies, preserves, sauces and cakes travel 
and store best. They can be frozen or covered tightly and sealed, then 
decorated in festive wrappers that boast the colors of the season. Dress up 
packages with ribbons and holly leaves and include the recipe so the recipient 
can make them next year. 
</P>
<P>
Proper wrapping is essential to ensure the quality of the gift, regardless of 
the type of food that is stored. Without it, it is impossible to preserve color 
or flavor. After consulting several published sources on the subject, The Times 
was able to compile the following suggestions for freezing, storing and mailing 
edible gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use a moisture / vapor-proof wrapping paper that is intended for freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When foil is used as a wrapper, heavy foil is preferred. Put foil-wrapped 
bundles in plastic bags for additional protection against punctures or holes in 
the freezer compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wax paper doesn't provide adequate protection and isn't recommended for 
freezing. But transparent plastic wrap, with its tremendous clinging quality 
that eliminates air pockets, is very pliable and an acceptable covering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure all containers are clean or sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't freeze cake batter, cream fillings, puddings and custards, mayonnaise 
or potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wrap cookies, cakes, breads and candies individually in plastic and store 
in airtight containers for maximum freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freeze fragile or irregularly shaped items on a baking sheet, then wrap as 
desired. But do not leave in the freezer more than 24 hours since unwrapped 
goods develop off flavors. A few hours to stiffen should be sufficient for 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fill containers with shredded tissue paper or packing straw to keep fragile 
gifts from breaking. Do not use popcorn or other edibles that may absorb fumes 
during transit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use freezer tape or fabric tape to seal lids of containers that might open 
or spill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep perishable foods refrigerated or frozen until ready to eat. Provide 
instructions for thawing and serving, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Label everything.
