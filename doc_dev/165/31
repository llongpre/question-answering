Cholesterol watchers can look forward to the debut this month of a new 
cholesterol-free egg noodle substitute. 
</P>
<P>
The word "substitute" may sound like a warning that you'll be getting a poor 
imitation of the real thing. But these noodles cook, look and taste like 
regular egg pasta. 
</P>
<P>
They're called No Yolks, in honor of the absence of the cholesterol-rich 
portion of the egg. The noodles do include eggs -- but only the whites. The 
other ingredients are enriched durum wheat flour and enriched corn flour, which 
provides a faint egg-yolk color. 
</P>
<P>
No Yolks can be used in any noodle dish -- salads, main dishes, soups and so 
forth. Manufactured by Foulds Inc. of Libertyville, Ill., they come in three 
widths -- medium, broad and extra-broad -- and cost about $1.25 for a 12-ounce 
bag. They'll be introduced in some independent markets next week, in Hughes 
Markets the following week, with wider distribution anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the nutrition information on the product label, a 2-ounce serving 
(dry measure) of No Yolks contains 210 calories, 10 fewer than 2 ounces of 
regular egg noodles. Protein and carbohydrate content are the same. Fat content 
is 1 gram lower (2 grams in No Yolks, 3 in regular egg noodles). Interestingly, 
the sodium content is higher -- 40 milligrams in No Yolks compared to 10 in 
regular noodles. But the cholesterol content drops to 0 in the substitute 
compared to 51 milligrams (a United States Department of Agriculture figure) in 
conventional egg noodles. 
</P>

Health Valley Foods Inc., of Irwindale, has recently launched several fat-free 
items. 
</P>
<P>
The first to appear, in May, were fat-free cookies, little powerhouses of fiber 
and fruit that come in five flavors: apple, date, Hawaiian fruit, apricot and 
raisin-oatmeal. Reading the label is like scanning the shelves at a 
natural-foods store. The Hawaiian fruit cookies contain a whole-grain-and-fiber 
blend made of organic whole wheat and oats; concentrated pineapple, pear and 
apple juices; papaya, pineapple, raisins, dates, banana flakes and mango. They 
also contain soy lecithin, high-chromium yeast and dulse, a sea vegetable that 
functions as a source of dietary fiber and as a thickening agent. Three of 
these cookies provide 75 calories, 3 grams dietary fiber, no cholesterol and 
less than 1 milligram of fat. 
</P>
<P>
The "fat-free" label for products that contain a trace of fat is perfectly 
legitimate, according to Bernie Landes, director of education at Health Valley 
Foods. "There is no food that is 100% fat-free unless it is synthetic," he 
said, explaining that small amounts of oil occur naturally in whole grains and 
tiny traces of fat may appear even in fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Regulations give companies a choice of declaring less than 1 milligram of fat 
on the label or rounding off to the nearest gram. And a product with a 
naturally occurring but nutritionally insignificant quantity of fat is entitled 
to be called fat-free, Landes said. 
</P>
<P>
Health Valley introduced fat-free muffins and fruit bars in July, followed by 
jumbo cookies later that month. Look for these products in supermarkets and 
also in natural foods stores. You'll pay about $1.89 for a package of 16 small 
or 9 jumbo cookies; the muffins are $2.69 for six, and the individually 
packaged fruit bars retail for about $2.49 for a package of four. 
</P>
<P>
Another product aimed at the health-conscious customer is Spicer's Wheat 
Snacks. These are tiny hollow morsels that look like kibble or bits of elbow 
macaroni. They are made from expanded wheat kernels and are intended to keep 
you feeling so full you won't be tempted to consume rich, fattening foods. 
</P>
<P>
Flavors include natural, chocolate, Cheddar cheese, barbecue and sour cream and 
onion. The natural flavor tastes sweet, as does the chocolate, which has a dark 
chocolate color but not its distinctive flavor. Spicer's suggests combining 
either of these with low-fat milk for a breakfast cereal. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/2-ounce packs are handy to carry about when you're on the run and 
unable to stop for a conventional meal. Although the snacks contain no 
cholesterol, they are not fat-free. A 1-ounce serving contains 5 grams of fat 
and 100 calories, according to the label. And the ingredients list indicates 
that corn oil has been added. 
</P>
<P>
The snacks sell for about 99 cents a pack, and they're available at a variety 
of outlets, including major chain markets.
