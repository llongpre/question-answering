<TEXT>     (check) The more you involve the children in planning, the more successful
the party.;   (check) Your child can invite the number of children equal to
his or her age. If she's 8 years old, she invites no more than eight guests;
if he's 3, he asks three.;   (check) When issuing invitations, be sure the
parents know all the facts. Should the child wear a costume? Will you serve a
snack or a meal? Will the party be outdoors?;   (check) Each child should have
a treat to take home.;   (check) A moldy-oldie idea from yesteryear: Kids love
nut cups. Yes, nut cups. Your youngster fills them with peanuts and Halloween
candy.; -- Suzanne Martinson, Scripps; Howard News Service; CARAMEL APPLES; 6
medium apples; 6 tablespoons granola, chopped peanuts or chopped candy-coated
chocolate candies; 1 14-ounce package vanilla caramels; 3 tablespoons water;
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter; 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon;  Poke a wooden
stick in the stem end of each apple.;   Using 1 tablespoon of granola, peanuts
or chopped candy-coated chocolate candies for each mound, make 6 mounds about
3 inches apart on waxed paper.;   In a saucepan combine caramels, water,
peanut butter and cinnamon and cook over low heat about 20 minutes or until
caramels are melted and mixture is smooth.;   Remove from heat. Dip each apple
in the hot caramel mixture and spoon mixture over the apple until it is
completely coated.;   Hold the apple right side up by the stick for a second,
then place it stick-side-up on one of the mounds of granola. Turn the apple so
all the granola sticks to it.;   Refrigerate about 1 hour or until the caramel
coating is firm.;   Variation: CHOCOLATY CARAMEL APPLES -- Use only 2
tablespoons of water. Use 1/4 cup chocolate chips in place of the peanut
butter and chocolate caramels in place of the vanilla caramels.;   -- From
"Betty Crocker's New Boys and Girls Cookbook," 1990, Betty Crocker; HALLOWEEN;
ORANGE SHERBET FREEZE; 6 medium oranges; 1 quart orange sherbet; 18 candy
corns;  Place each orange on its side. Use a serrated knife to cut a slice
about 1/2 inch from the stem. Repeat the process for all the oranges. Run a
serrated knife around the inside edge of each orange to loosen orange
sections. Remove orange sections with a spoon.;   Dry orange skins thoroughly
with a dish cloth. Decorate oranges with black markers so that they look like
jack-o'-lanterns.;   Spoon sherbet into hollowed orange skins. Garnish the top
of each orange with three candy corns.;   Freeze oranges for at least 4 hours.
Remove a few minutes before serving to allow to soften slightly. Makes 6
oranges at 216 calories per serving.;   Note: Save orange juice and sections
for a cool snack.; -- From "Young Chef's Nutrition Guide and Cookbook" by
Carolyn E. Moore, Ph.D., R.D., Mimi Kerr and Robert Shulman, M.D., 1990,

plates. Arrange cheese cut-outs on muffins for face. Add olive slices for

carrot cake mix with pudding;  Creamy Frosting:; 3 cups confectioners' sugar;
1/3 cup margarine or butter, softened; 2 tablespoons milk; 1 1/2 teaspoons
vanilla;  Red and yellow food coloring;  Flat black jelly candies, see note; 
Candy corn;  Prepare cake according to package directions using 2 8- or 9-inch
round pans that have been greased and floured. Cool layers completely and
remove cakes from pan.;   Frosting: Mix confectioners' sugar and margarine in
a medium bowl. Stir in milk and vanilla and beat frosting until smooth and of
spreading consistency. If frosting is too thick, add a little more milk. If
frosting is too thin, add a little more confectioners' sugar.;   Tint frosting
by using a few drops of red and yellow food color. Start slow, adding more
drops to get the color of orange you like.;   Fill the layers and frost the
cake.;   Make a jack-o'-lantern face with the black jelly candy and candy
corn.;   Note: Licorice can be substituted for black jelly candies.;   -- From
"Betty Crocker's; New Boys and Girls Cookbook."; HALLOWEEN PUMPKIN; COOKIES
PROJECT; 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter or margarine; 1 cup cooked pumpkin; 1 cup
sugar; 1 egg, slightly beaten; 1 teaspoon milk; 1 teaspoon vanilla; 2 cups
all-purpose or unbleached flour; 2 teaspoons baking powder; 1 teaspoon baking
soda; 1 teaspoon cinnamon; 1/2 teaspoon salt; 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips;
1/2 cup nuts, optional;  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place the butter or
margarine in a heat-proof glass dish. Cover and microwave on high for 30
seconds. In a large bowl, mix together pumpkin, sugar, melted butter or
margarine, beaten egg, milk and vanilla. (You can use an electric mixer for
this step, but when you add the flour, the dough will get stiff and you can
beat it better by hand.);   In separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder,
baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Add to pumpkin mixture and mix until smooth.
Stir in chocolate chips and nuts. Drop from a teaspoon onto lightly greased
baking sheet. Line up about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or
until golden brown. Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes. Remove to wire rack to
finish cooling. Store in an airtight container. Makes about 36 cookies.;   --
