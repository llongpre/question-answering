   Thousands of sweet-toothed buyers, sellers and
distributors stepped into a child's fantasy Friday as they wandered
from booth to booth at a candy convention sampling free chocolates,
picture cookies and Gummy bears.
   And they had plenty to smile about: Candy industry news is
sugar-coated.
   Americans will spend about $12 billion dollars this year to
consume about 5 billion pounds of chocolate and non-chocolate
treats _ nearly 20 pounds per person. In the past five years, the
U.S. confectionery business has grown 3 percent to 6 percent
annually, according to industry figures.
   ``Candy is rolling strong,'' said Jerry Prescott, president of
DEBS, a confectionery distributor that tracks candy sales and
trends. ``Chocolate is still an in-thing. The concerns over acne
have been kind of disproven, you've got the dollar up so some
pretty big advertisers are coming in.''
   At the 43rd annual National Candy Wholesalers Association
convention, which began Thursday and ends Sunday, there was little
talk of cavities or the U.S. surgeon general's report earlier this
week about the importance of good nutrition in preventing diseases.
   ``The whole issue of health has dissipated so much,'' said
Shelley Grossman of the National Candy Wholesalers Association.
``As consumers have become more aware of their own health, they are
much more likely to treat themselves to something like candy.''
   Scant few granola bars or health snacks could be found on the
convention floor, though companies like Quaker Oats and Veryfine
juices had displays and microwave popcorn appeared popular.
   New sweets like Boogers, green and squishy and designed to look
like the real thing, and Slime Slurps, gummy monsters that change
color, had glitzy booths. Old reliables touted their time-tested
sweets.
   ``Pez is more than a candy _ it's a system,'' said Pez Candy Co.
president Scott McWhinnie, popping open a new Garfield dispenser to
demonstrate. ``It's great tasting and fun to play with at the same
time.''
   Pez was developed in 1927 in Vienna, Austria, and the dispenser
was introduced, sans heads, in Europe in 1950. Character heads and
flavors were added in the United States in 1952. Today Americans
consume about 1 billion Pez candies anually, McWhinnie said.
   But until recently, the company hadn't resolved the common
childhood lament: Pez topple over. ``Pez dispensers have feet,''
McWhinnie said, proudly. ``Now they stand up.''
   Tucked in a corner of a floor redolent of chocolate, Martin B.
Palmer, the president of the the 110-year-old Palmer Candy Co. of
Sioux City, Iowa, was handing out the LaFama, a chopped pecan and
cream bar covered in chocolate.
   The company uses 90-year-old copper kettles to make the bars,
which bear the same goofy package lettering used when the bar
debuted in 1914.
   ``Good candy doesn't go out of style,'' said Palmer, 31, the
fifth generation president of the company with annual sales of
nearly $10 million.
   Nationally, Snickers, made by M&amp;M Mars, is the top seller of
some 750 different candy bar brands. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,
made by Hershey Foods, is number two, followed by peanut and then
plain M&amp;Ms.
   M&amp;M Mars and Hershey combine for about 70 percent of the
chocolate bar market. The reintroduction of red M&amp;Ms last year
after an eight-year absence because of concerns over food dyes was
the talk of the candy world.
   The convention was not open to the public, but kids will get a
crack at the candy eventually. Organizers estimate two to three
tons of treats will be donated to charities at the end of the
meeting.
