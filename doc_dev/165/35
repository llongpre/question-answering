<LEADPARA>  I USUALLY spend New Year's Eve with several close friends: First an early
dinner in our favorite Chinese restaurant, then a movie, and we're ready to
welcome the new year in a festive and frivolous mood. What could be more
elegant than returning to a gorgeously rich array of desserts and iced
champagne in the coziness of one's own home?;   Picture a table of crepes
filled with chocolate, fruits and luxurious creams. Most of the preparation
can be done ahead, so pull out all the stops and use your best china and
crystal flutes. Have the champagne chilled and an urn of coffee ready to be
poured. This will truly be a memorably sweet ending to 1991.  </LEADPARA>
