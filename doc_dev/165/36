<LEADPARA>  AS I WALKED into Louis Smith's kitchen, I knew I was in the home of a serious
cook. The diffused light, which poured through the stained glass window over
the sink, played upon the stately two-story high oak cabinetry and matching
oak floor as Louis took me on a tour. Louis and his wife, Marie,
custom-designed the kitchen to suit their cooking and entertaining style. In
the large kitchen island, Louis had two pull-out shelves installed under the
counter to hold his mixer and processor. At the flip of a wrist, each shelf
moves up to the level of the counter top so Louis can easily prepare recipes
which call for these appliances.;    In one section of the kitchen is a
floor-to-ceiling cabinet designed to store table linens. In another section is
a cabinet which conceals a mirrored wet bar complete with glass shelves to
hold an impressive collection of stemware.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I have always enjoyed cooking," Smith said. "I was inspired to cook at an
early age by my Portuguese grandfather and my mother, both of whom were good
cooks. I was 12 years old the first time I ever cooked anything. My mother and
father were gone for the day and I made them a lemon meringue pie from a
cookbook recipe. When Mom came home, she said that the pie was absolutely
beautiful and delicious, but she thought that I had successfully dirtied every
dish in the house.;    "I don't like following a recipe, though, anymore,"
Smith said. "I think the most important thing when creating a meal is to be
directed by what pleases your palate.";    Louis and Marie enjoy cooking
together, making feasts for friends and family. "When my son Dan got married
three years ago, we made a gourmet dinner for his rehearsal. The menu included
homemade eggplant Parmesan, beef Wellington, soup, salad and my homemade white
chocolate cake.";    Smith enjoys cooking for large groups. One Valentine's
Day, Louis and Marie created a theme feast for some special friends.;    "Our
main dish was individual salmon Wellingtons which were covered with my own
puff pastry and decorated with three puff pastry hearts," Smith said. "For the
soup course, we made a puree of red bell peppers and cheddar cheese. Each
guest found their place at the table with chocolate heart name plates which I
designed.";    Smith's ability to create a calming atmosphere is critical in
his Fremont business: Berge, Pappas, and Smith Mortuary. "My occupation is a
challenge. The loss of a loved one is one of the most difficult times in
people's lives," Smith said.;    "It is up to us to be able to do things for
people at a time when they need help. I consider the people that I work with
not as just business clients, but as friends.";    Once a year at Christmas
time, Smith honors the Catholic families that he has served with a special
mass at the Holy Family of the Dominican Sisters in Fremont. "We have over 300
people attending each year.";    After the mass, he hosts a reception with
cookies coffee and tea. "I am the cookie maker and I usually bake about 50
different varieties.";    Since Smith believes cookies are appropriate goodies
any time of the year, he shares some of his favorite recipes for summertime
munching.;     LINZERTORTE COOKIES; 1 1/2 cups (8 ounces) unblanched almonds;
