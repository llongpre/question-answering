<LEADPARA>  A Mountain View reader, Ray Peck, likes to eat meals that he's made from whole
foods and requested a recipe for faux grape nuts. Sue Ferguson of Union City
sent this one. "I've made it several times and have had great reviews from
everyone," she said.;    Ferguson said it originated from an Amish Cooking
Show on PBS, "Cooking from Quilt Country."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  HOMEMADE GRAPE NUTS;  3 1/2 cups graham flour;  1 1/2 cups light brown sugar; 
1 teaspoon salt;  1 teaspoon baking soda;  2 teaspoons cinnamon;  2 cups
buttermilk;  2 teaspoons vanilla;   Combine dry ingredients; add buttermilk
and vanilla. Mix well. Spread on well-greased jelly roll pan and smooth out.
Bake at 350 for 50 to 60 minutes.;    Let the pan cool overnight. The
following day, break into pieces (granola size). Place these on cookie sheets
(will fill two, each one layer high). Toast in 250 degree oven for 30 to 35
minutes. When cool, store in air-tight containers.;    Note: Ferguson adds
sliced almonds and raisins or other dried fruits to the grape nuts.; 
Raspberry muffins;  Marge Healy, Santa Clara, misplaced a recipe for raspberry
muffins made with raspberry wine. Alberta Dellamaggiore, San Jose, came to the
rescue with this one:;    RASPBERRY MUFFINS;  3 cups flour;  1 tablespoon
baking powder;  1/2 teaspoon salt;  1/8 teaspoon soda;  1/2 cup margarine or
butter;  1 cup sugar;  1 teaspoon vanilla;  2 eggs;  1/2 cup raspberry wine; 
1/2 cup water;  1 cup coarsely chopped fresh or frozen raspberries;   Lightly
grease muffin cups or line with paper baking cups; set aside. Reserve 3
tablespoons flour. In a mixing bowl, stir together remaining flour, baking
powder, salt and baking soda; set aside.;    In a large mixer bowl, beat
margarine or butter with an electric mixer on medium speed for 30 seconds. Add
sugar and vanilla; beat until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well.; 
  Stir together wine and water. Add flour mixture and liquid alternately to
beaten mixture, beating on low speed after each addition just until combined.
Toss together reserved flour and berries; gently fold into batter. Spoon
batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in a 400 oven for 18 to 20 minutes.
Serve warm. Makes 16 to 18 muffins.;  Buckwheat cakes;  Claire Mundt, San
Jose, requested a recipe for buckwheat pancakes made from scratch. Tammy
Raetz, Mountain View, sent this recipe. She said that when the cakes are made
frequently -- three times a week, for example -- fresh yeast will not be
required if a little more than a pint of the batter is reserved each time and
kept in a cool place and then used instead of the yeast. Molasses in buckwheat
cakes gives them a good color.;    RAISED BUCKWHEAT; PANCAKES;  2 cups boiling
water;  1/2 cup cornmeal;  1/2 cake yeast;  1/4 cup lukewarm water;  1
tablespoon molasses;  1 teaspoon salt;  2 cups buckwheat flour;  1/4 teaspoon
baking soda;  1/3 cup hot milk;   Pour boiling water over cornmeal and let
stand until it swells. Soften yeast in the lukewarm water. After cornmeal is
cool, add molasses, salt, yeast and flour. Beat thoroughly and set in a warm
place to rise over night. It should rise and fall again by morning. Add soda
dissolved in hot milk; stir well and bake cakes on a hot greased griddle.
Makes 20.;  Truffles a la microwave;  Marian Crowel, Cupertino, took classes
in microwave cooking recently and wanted to share her knowledge of making
truffles via the microwave. She sent this recipe.;    MICROWAVE CHOCOLATE;
TRUFFLES;  1 16-ounce package melting chocolate;  1/2 cup whipping cream;  
Flavoring oils;  8 ounces white chocolate, melted;   Nuts, cherries, etc.;  
Melt chocolate and whipping cream in deep bowl in microwave on high for 1
minute. Stir gently. May need 20 to 30 seconds more. Flavoring oils can be
added if desired.;    Let cool, covered, in refrigerator until chocolate can
be shaped by hand. Shape into balls. Balls can be rolled in nuts or a cherry
or nut inserted in center. Cover by dipping in white, melted chocolate. Place
on wax paper until set.;     Calls for help;  Carol Koyama, San Jose, is
looking for the following recipes:;    (check) "Sour cream oatmeal cookies.
They're like regular oatmeal cookies except the sour cream gives them an extra
moist cake-like texture;;    (check) "Peach cobbler recipe that was on KQED's
"Chefs of the West." It was made with canned peaches and the biscuit topping
dough was runny.  </TEXT>
