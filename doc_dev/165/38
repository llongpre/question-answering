MENUS: THE LITTLEST FOOD CRITICS -- CATERERS COME UP WITH NEW TWISTS ON OLD 
FAVORITES IN AN ATTEMPT TO PLEASE THEM.

<P>
Having a hard time figuring out what to pack in your child's lunch box? You're 
not alone. When we asked some of the best caterers in town to come up with 
interesting new ideas for school lunches, the repetition was amazing. There 
were lots of peanut butter sandwiches, chicken or turkey in abundance, and more 
celery than you can shake a stick at. For dessert -- cookies, of course. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lesson here; these caterers understand the aesthetics of eating. They 
know that no food critic is more exacting (or more of a traditionalist) than a 
child, and that the last thing any kid wants is to show up at school with Mom's 
latest experiment. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to kids, caterers know enough to stick with the tried and true. 
And we know that if you try these recipes, your kids will be very happy when 
lunchtime rolls around.
