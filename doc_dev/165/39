<LEADPARA>  FOOD historian Waverley Root says, "It's not the pasta that puts the weight on
in Italy, it's the dolci.";    Dolci means sweets, but it's the catchall term
for Italian desserts. You may be thinking less about dessert as you shoehorn
into this summer's beachwear, but the concept of no-bake Italian desserts may
make you think again, especially if their names roll seductively off the
tongue, such as zuccotto, dolce torinese, zabaglione and cassata.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The name zuccotto is derived from zucca, the Italian word for pumpkin,
because zuccotto looks like a halved pumpkin sitting on a plate. A pink
pumpkin, but a pumpkin nonetheless. Zuccotto is nothing more than a dome of
booze-soaked pound cake or spongecake filled with flavored whipped cream. Some
recipes call for pastry cream as well, but I've never tasted a zuccotto that
was as good or as simple as mine (not bragging, you understand).;    And to
make your life even easier in these lazy-hazy days of summer, you can buy
rather than bake the pound cake. I used to make my own pound cake for this
recipe, until I realized I couldn't tell the difference between it and Sara
Lee's after a good soaking in orange liqueur and cognac. And frozen pound cake
is easier to work with.;    Though dolce torinese is called a chocolate loaf,
it's basically a very large candy bar. Eat your heart out, Mars and Hershey:
Dolce torinese has you beat by a mile. Waiters in my first restaurant used to
fight over this one.;    Zabaglione is a simple custard made with Marsala
wine. Though classically it is made tableside by tuxedo-clad waiters in
overpriced Italian restaurants, I think that version is too rich. By chilling
zabaglione and cutting it with whipped cream (if one can indeed "cut" anything
with whipped cream), the flavor is less intense. Chilled zabaglione can be
served with poached fruit -- pears are ideal -- or fresh berries.;    Or, you
can make zabaglione ice cream and serve it with a homemade butterscotch
sauce.;    Cassata is a Sicilian specialty usually served at Easter. There are
a million versions of this dessert, most of them achingly sweet with fondant
icing, marzipan and glaceed fruit. Some are molded, much like zuccotto. And
sometimes cassata is frozen. But the one constant is candied fruit.;    The
cassata I like is a split pound cake layered with flavored ricotta cheese and
frosted with chocolate.;    Assuming you buy a pound cake, none of these
desserts require turning on the oven. And only the zabaglione and amaretto
mousse necessitate using the top of the stove. Nuts can be toasted in the
microwave oven and chocolate can be melted the same way. (Note: Times for
melting chocolate and toasting nuts are for low-power ovens. Lower the time if
you have a high-power oven.); ZUCCOTTO; 2 ounces each, almonds and filberts; 2
ounces walnuts, chopped; 6 ounces semisweet chocolate; 1 envelope (2 1/2
teaspoons) plain gelatin; 2 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup orange liqueur;  1/4 cup
cognac or brandy;  1/2 cup grenadine; 3 cups heavy cream;  1/2 cup
confectioners' sugar (adjust to taste);   Cheesecloth; 1 16-ounce pound cake
or spongecake;   Arrange almonds and filberts on a dish in a single layer and
toast in a microwave oven at full power for 5 minutes or until lightly
toasted. Chop coarsely, add to walnuts and set aside. Break 4 ounces of the
chocolate into 1-ounce pieces and melt in the microwave oven at full power for
3 minutes. Set aside to cool. Chop the remaining chocolate coarsely and add to
the nuts.;    In a small cup, sprinkle gelatin over two tablespoons of orange
liqueur. Let set several minutes to soften. Combine remaining orange liqueur
with cognac and grenadine, set aside. Heat gelatin mixture just until gelatin
dissolves. Let cool. Whip cream with sugar. Add gelatin mixture and beat until
stiff. Refrigerate.;    Line a 2-quart bowl with damp cheesecloth. Cut pound
cake into 3/8-inch slices. Then cut about 1/3 of the slices in half on the
diagonal, making triangles. Moisten one side of each piece with the liqueur
mixture. Fit pieces around the inside of the bowl, with moistened sides facing
the cheesecloth. The points of the triangles should be pointing toward the
bottom center of the bowl. Pieces should fan out, forming a star-burst
pattern. Once the bottom layer is formed, you can place slices whole around
the upper sides of the bowl in brick-like fashion. Fill in any gaps with bits
of pound cake. (The pattern need not be perfect. It will show up quite well
when it is unmolded.) The cake should just reach the top of the bowl.;   
Brush the inside of the mold with the liqueur mixture. Take 2/3 of the whipped
cream and mix in the nuts and chopped chocolate. Divide this mixture in half.
Pour half the chocolate-nut mixture in the zuccotto cavity, leveling it. Mix
the other half with the melted chocolate. Add this to the zuccotto cavity,
leveling it. Add the plain whipped cream as the final layer, leveling it so
that it settles just below (about 3/8 inch) the outer layer of cake.;    Fit
the remaining pieces of pound cake over the last layer of whipped cream,
dipping one side in the liqueur mixture first, as above. Fashion them any way
that works to cover the last layer of whipped cream. When done, brush the top
with the remaining liqueur mixture.;    Put a plate on top of the mold, wrap
the bowl with plastic wrap, then refrigerate (or freeze) it several hours or
overnight. To unmold, invert onto a plate. Remove the bowl and cheesecloth.
Cut into wedges. Serves 10 to 12.;    (hbox);    DOLCE TORINESE; 1 1/2  cups
(about 5 ounces) almonds;  1/2 pound semisweet chocolate, cut in small pieces;
 1/4 cup rum;   Vegetable oil or cooking spray;  1/2 pound softened butter; 2
tablespoons sugar; 2 eggs, separated;   Pinch salt; 12 butter biscuits such as
Petits Beurre or Social Tea, broken into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch pieces; 
Confectioners' sugar;   Whipped cream (optional);   Arrange almonds on a dish
in a single layer and put in a microwave oven at full power 5 minutes, or
until lightly toasted. Chop coarsely and set aside. Melt chocolate in the
microwave at full power 4 minutes. Combine with rum and set aside.;    Lightly
grease the inside of a 1 1/2-quart loaf pan with vegetable oil or cooking
spray. Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add sugar,
then egg yolks, one at a time. With a rubber spatula, stir in almonds and
chocolate. With clean blades, whip egg whites and salt until stiff but not
dry. Stir half the egg whites into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the
remainder, blending just until white no longer shows. Fold in cookie pieces,
omitting crumbs.;    Spoon mixture into loaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate several hours or more. Run a thin knife around the sides of the
loaf pan and invert onto a serving platter to unmold. Smooth sides and top
with a flexible spatula and sieve confectioners' sugar on top. Cut loaf into
slices and serve with whipped cream on the side, if desired. Serves 8.;    --

(hbox);    ZABAGLIONE; 5 tablespoons sugar; 2 egg yolks;  1/4 cup dry Marsala
wine;  1/2 cup heavy cream;   In a heat-proof bowl or the top half of a double
boiler, combine sugar and yolks until thoroughly incorporated. Add Marsala and
stir well. Put bowl over gently simmering water and stir with a whisk until
mixture becomes thick and you can begin to see the bottom of the bowl as you
stir, about 8 to 10 minutes.;    At this point, zabaglione can be served hot,
in stemmed glasses with a macaroon cookie on the side.;    To serve cold, with
poached fruit or fresh berries, chill zabaglione. Whip cream until stiff. Fold
into zabaglione and pour over fruit. Serves 4.;    CASSATA; 1 pound ricotta
cheese; 2 tablespoons heavy cream;  3/4 cup sugar; 3 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup
orange liqueur;  1/2 cup mixed candied fruit, coarsely chopped; 3 ounces
semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped;  1/4 cup rum or cognac; 1 pound cake,
about 10 inches long and 3 inches wide; 12 ounces semisweet chocolate, cut in
1-inch pieces;  3/4 cup espresso or strong coffee;  1/2 pound chilled butter,
cut in 1/2-inch pieces;   Put ricotta through a food mill or sieve. Then beat
with cream, sugar and 3 tablespoons of orange liqueur with an electric mixer
until smooth. Fold in candied fruit and chocolate and refrigerate.;    Combine
rum or cognac with remaining orange liqueur. Trim and square off edges of
pound cake. Slice lengthwise into 1/2- to 3/4-inch slabs. Drizzle about 2
tablespoons of liqueur mix over each slab.;    Put bottom slab of pound cake
in the middle of the platter. Spread flavored ricotta over the slab. Place
another slab on top and repeat the process until all slabs and ricotta filling
are used up, ending with a plain piece of cake on top. Smooth sides and even
up slabs so they are in alignment.;    Put the 12 ounces of chocolate in a
covered microwave-proof dish and put in a microwave oven at full power for 4
1/2 minutes. Stir in coffee. Place in the mixing bowl of an electric mixer and
beat in chilled butter, one piece at a time, until the mixture is smooth.
Chill frosting until it is spreadable consistency. With a flexible metal
spatula, frost the cake, leaving enough frosting to decorate with a pastry
bag. Cover and refrigerate at least 24 hours before serving. Serves 8 to 10.;
AMARETTO MOUSSE; 2 packets gelatin (about 4 teaspoons);  3/4 cup Amaretto; 8
eggs, separated;  3/4 cup sugar; 2 cups heavy cream;   Pinch salt;   Sprinkle
gelatin over 1/4 cup of the Amaretto. Put over low heat and remove when
mixture turns clear. Set aside. Mix yolks and sugar well. Add remaining
Amaretto and put in the top half of a double boiler. Stir with a whisk over
moderate heat until it thickens slightly, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from
heat, mix in the gelatin and let cool, stirring a few times.;    Whip cream
until soft peaks form. Whip egg whites with salt until soft peaks form. Fold
whipped cream into egg yolk mixture. Fold in egg whites. Pour into a serving
bowl or wine goblets. Serves 10.  </TEXT>
