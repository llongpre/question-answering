<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; RECIPE; LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  SUICIDE cake and decadent cake, recipes requested by Mae Gianocca of Half Moon
Bay, sounded both dire and to-die-for. The exotic names stuck in the mind of
David Nave of San Jose and he searched his recipes recalling an oddly named --
and certainly richly decadent -- cake he enjoyed at the Salmon Poacher in
Soquel. He found the recipe.; HEART ATTACK CAKE  </LEADPARA>

CAKE' IS WORTH THE RISK  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>  20 ounces bittersweet dark chocolate; 1 1/4 cup super-fine sugar; 1 pound
unsalted butter; 2 ounces Grand Marnier; 10 egg yolks, room temperature; 10
egg whites, room temperature; 1/4 cup super-fine sugar; Powdered sugar; Melt
chocolate in top of double boiler over very low heat. When chocolate has
melted, whisk in 1 1/4 cups sugar, mixing well until sugar has dissolved.
Whisk in butter and melt, stirring often. When butter is completely
incorporated, remove mixture from fire and whisk in Grand Marnier.;   Whip egg
yolks in mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Slowly add chocolate mixture to
egg yolks, whipping constantly until fully incorporated. Set aside. Whip egg
whites in another mixing bowl until foamy and add remaining 1/4 cup sugar.
Continue whipping until stiff.;   Place egg whites in bowl with chocolate and
fold together. When mixture is smooth and all lumps are gone, pour into
buttered and floured 12-inch spring-form pan. Bake at 275 for 3 hours.;  
Remove from oven, let rest 20 minutes. Invert onto plate and remove form. Dust
with powdered sugar and serve with vanilla sauce and/or raspberry puree, if
desired.; Sweet politics; Cheryl V. Swanson of Daly City saw a recipe for
Watergate salad in the Mercury News Food Section and that set her to
reminiscing. "In the '70s, my mom made a Watergate cake and I have always
wondered about the name," she wrote. "Was it just a sign of the time or was
there something more? I have never been able to find the name of the
originator. I guess it must be part of a coverup."; WATERGATE CAKE WITH
COVER-UP ICING; Cake:; 1 package white cake mix; 3 eggs; 1/2 cup coconut; 1 3
1/2-ounce package instant pistachio pudding; 3/4 cup salad oil; 1 cup 7UP; 1
cup chopped nuts; Icing:; 2 envelopes Dream Whip; 1 1/2 cups milk; 1 3
1/2-ounce package instant pistachio pudding; 1/2 cup coconut; 3/4 cups chopped
nuts; Mix cake ingredients and pour into greased and floured 9-by-13-inch pan.
Bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes.;   Beat Dream Whip, milk and pudding
until very thick. Spread on cooled cake and sprinkle coconut and nuts on top.;
Tangy jam; Joe Malone of Saratoga thanks readers for the recipe for tomato
jam.;   He enclosed a recipe for tomato preserves. "My mother sent this to me
years ago when I was complaining about too many tomatoes. I have successfully
used it for a number of years but discovered that it doesn't use up many
tomatoes," he wrote. The recipe comes from the August 1941 Better Homes and
Gardens.; OLD-FASHIONED TOMATO; PRESERVES; 2 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes; 1/4 cup
lemon juice; Grated rind of 1 lemon; 6 1/2  cups sugar; 1 bottle fruit pectin;
 Peel tomatoes; cut in eighths or crush. Measure tomatoes; there should be 3
1/2 cups pulp. Cook over low heat 10 minutes. Add lemon juice and lemon rind.
Combine tomato mixture and sugar; bring to full rolling boil over high heat,
stirring constantly while cooking. Boil hard 2 minutes and then remove from
heat. Stir in fruit pectin. Skim and seal in hot, sterilized jars. Makes 6
1/2-pint jars.; Calls for help; Julie Normandin of San Jose would like two
recipes: one for the cranberry-nut muffins like those sold at Nordstrom's
Cafe. They are large and shaped like a small bundt cake. She also requests a
good pumpkin-nut muffin recipe.;   "I hope you and your readers will be able
to help me find a cookie recipe that my aunt gave me about 30 years ago,"
writes Anne Cavalli of San Jose. The recipe was found in an insert in a flour
bag. Besides the usual ingredients such as sugar, baking soda, salt, butter,
the recipe called for a can of evaporated milk and 3 1/2 cups flour. The
batter was very thick and the cookies were almost cake-like.  </TEXT>
