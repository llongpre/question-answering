<LEADPARA>  WHEN gingham dogs and calico cats replace frills and furbelows in the nation's
decorative psyche, it must be time for retrofood.;   Handmade brownies and
wood-smoked barbecues now have more cachet than architectural desserts rising
out of spun sugar and a crown roast of lamb.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Cost has something to do with it: $50 will buy you a lot more brownies than
fancy sugar creations, more barbecue than crown roasts. For anyone who must
cut costs on holiday gift giving but doesn't want the recipients to notice,
experts recommend food.;   "Food is the perfect gift that cannot be priced,"
said Jay Walker, chairman of Catalog Media Corp., a marketing and promotional
agency. "If I am trying to save money and I buy you a sweater you'll know what
I spend. If I buy you a dozen figs from Israel do you have any idea what I
spent?";   Expounding on his theory that mail-order food is a no-risk gift,
Walker said: "You'll pay $18 for 14 pears not because they are worth $18 but
because 14 pears is a really neat gift. It's better than a sweater because
it's unique and I never met anyone who didn't like a pear or a pie. Nine out
of nine people like pears; two out of nine people like the sweater you bought
them.";   The mail-order packaging may not be elaborate, but the quality of
the food is as high as ever. To find the best products, all the gifts
considered for our list were purchased under names that would not be
recognized by the companies.;   Companies unable to fill the orders properly
or whose product arrived in poor condition were eliminated from
consideration.;   The shipping costs for some items, often as much as the
product itself, made several gifts impractical.;   Both the U.S. Postal
Service and United Parcel Service have raised shipping rates in the last year,
in some cases as much as 40 percent.;   Sweets;   Miss Grace Lemon Cake Co.,
