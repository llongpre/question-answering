HOMEMADE CANDY IS ALWAYS PERFECT GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich evaporated milk serves as a delicious base for homemade candies -- a 
perfect gift for giving. Its creamy, smooth texture helps the candy remain 
moist and fresh for several days. 
</P>
<P>
But be sure to choose the right cooking pan to allow the candy ingredients to 
boil freely without running over. It should be heavy enough to keep candy from 
burning or sticking to the bottom. In general, the pan should be about four 
times as great in volume as the ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Using a long wooden spoon that won't get too hot to handle is another plus for 
home candy makers. A candy thermometer is also a good buy since successful 
candy making depends on the temperature and the thermometer takes the guesswork 
out of testing the doneness. Be sure to remove candy from heat as you test for 
doneness so that overcooking does not occur. 
</P>
<P>
Start candy making with Chocolate-Covered Pecans and Caramel, or Turtles as 
they are more commonly called. This simple confection is ideal since it can be 
prepared in a relatively short time. 
</P>
<P>
In small saucepan, heat 1/4 cup butter or margarine and 1 cup evaporated milk 
until butter is melted. In separate 2-quart saucepan, over medium heat, cook 1 
cup sugar, 1 cup dark corn syrup and 1/4 teaspoon salt until it reaches 
firm-ball stage (244 degrees). Stir often. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly pour in hot milk mixture so that sugar mixture does not stop boiling. 
Stir constantly. Cook mixture until candy reaches firm-ball stage again, then 
remove pan from heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla and cool caramel to room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange 4 pecans per Turtle on wax paper and place heaping teaspoon of cooled 
caramel on each. Let cool until firm. Melt 1 (6-ounce) package semisweet 
chocolate pieces on top of double-boiler and spread over caramel. Let cool 
until hardened.

<P>
To give chocolate shiny, hard coating, add 1 to 2 tablespoons melted paraffin 
wax to chocolate, if desired.
