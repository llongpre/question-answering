Mexican Independence Day this weekend will no doubt inspire a round of 
celebrations. Since parties usually mean chips and dips, this is the time to 
try out a crunchy, full-flavored chip that is authentically Mexican but not 
commonly known: duritos. 
</P>
<P>
Think of duritos as a cross between Indonesian shrimp chips, pasta and 
chicharrones. Raw, they look like strips of hard, ridged, translucent pasta. 
When deep-fried, they puff up like shrimp chips. And they look a little like 
chicharrones -- crisp-fried pork cracklings that also make good snacks. The 
difference is, duritos are made from flour and not from meat. 
</P>
<P>
The raw chips are manufactured in Mexico and exported to Los Angeles. They're 
available here in a variety of markets, among them the Tianguis chain, the 
Grand Central Public Market in downtown Los Angeles and Market Basket in 
Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can buy bags of fried duritos processed by Del Mar Foods Co. of 
Oceanside and packaged under its Don Victor label. Del Mar produces duritos 
flavored with chili powder and lemon in two sizes -- small dippers and 
large-sized chips. The large chips are also available without seasoning, and 
the little dippers come in two additional flavors: shrimp and jalapeno. 
Tianguis carries the Don Victor chips. 
</P>
<P>
Olvera Street is a good source for another type of treat -- candy. The 
selection of typical Mexican dulces (sweets) displayed in stalls there includes 
biznaga, which is cactus candy. Biznaga is often cut fine and added to the 
filling for chiles en nogada -- fresh poblano chiles stuffed with meat, fruit 
and nuts and topped with walnut sauce and pomegranate seeds. It's a dish linked 
to pomegranate season, which is getting underway now. 
</P>
<P>
Look also for candied sweet potato (camote) and squash (calabaza). Coconut 
turns up in alfajores (blocks of white coconut candy tinted shocking pink on 
one side) and cocadas, baked confections that vendors define as macaroons. 
</P>
<P>
Pepitoria, the Mexican version of pralines, contains either peanuts or pecans. 
And there are individually wrapped circles of mazapan (marzipan) made of 
peanuts ground as fine as dust. 
</P>
<P>
Milk and sugar cooked together is the base for a number of candies including 
jamoncillo (bars of plain milk fudge); rosquilla (ridged bars of 
coconut-flavored milk fudge); marina (balls of milk fudge coated with chopped 
pecans); gorditas de leche (milk fudge patties) and leche quemada (burnt milk 
fudge). 
</P>
<P>
And there's still more -- balls of sweet-sour tamarind-flavored candy, rolls of 
guava paste, melcocha (taffy) and large cookies, either plain or coated with 
multicolored candy sprinkles (grajea). Look for the candies at the stands that 
line the center of the street. 
</P>

In some Olvera Street shops, you'll find equipment for cooking and serving 
Mexican meals. The Casa de Sousa's stock of pottery includes stunning, large 
talavera-style bowls in deep blue and cream from Guadalajara and a hand-painted 
brown dinner set from Michoacan. Blue-rimmed, handblown glassware and 
ornamental tin service plates would create a striking table. On the practical 
side, there are molcajetes (rough stone mortars), tortilla presses and iron 
comales (griddles) on which to bake the tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
The Casa California offers pottery bean pots and enormous cazuelas that could 
function as serving containers for a large gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Here you will find the highly effective aluminum lime squeezers that are 
manufactured in Mexico. A larger size in the same design is used for oranges. 
Other kitchenware includes wooden spoons, rolling pins and molinillos, the 
wooden beaters that are used to froth hot chocolate. The shop also carries 
yarn-embroidered baskets for tortillas and has at least one of the large, 
unlined copper cazuelas in which Mexican cooks prepare sweets and other dishes.
