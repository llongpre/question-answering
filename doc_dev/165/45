   Chocolate milk, that longtime
mainstay of kids' lunches, won't be on the elementary schools' menu
come fall because the school board thinks it's unhealthy for
growing minds.
   Instead, a calcium-fortified orange drink may be offered.
   Some teachers and nurses who have expressed concern about
children having sweets at lunch requested the ban, Superintendent
Robert J. Moore said Wednesday.
   The panel voted 5-4 this week to discontinue selling chocolate
milk at lunch to the 4,000 pupils in the township's 10 elementary
schools.
   Moore said several school employees said they noticed children
who drank chocolate milk for lunch showed signs of hyperactivity in
the afternoon.
   ``Whether that's scientifically qualified, I don't know,'' Moore
said.
   Chocolate milk outsells regular milk 2-1 at Aletta Crichton
Elementary School, Principal Gerald L. DeClementi said.
   ``That's eight cases of chocolate to four cases of white a
day,'' he said.
   DeClementi said he was unaware of behavior problems that might
be tied to the chocolate milk.
   Both he and Moore said they doubt the ban will provoke an outcry.
   But if it does, school board President Thomas Bridge said the
panel could change its decision.
   Bridge, who cast the tie-breaking vote, said he was a fan of the
banished beverage.
   ``I love chocolate milk,'' Bridge said. ``But yes, there is a
lot of merit to the fact that chocolate has an effect on children.''
