   Lovers seeking the sweetest of gifts on St.
Valentine's Day would be wise to pay a visit to Joseph Schmidt, a
chocolatier for a queen and a president who has elevated
candy-making to an art.
   In his shop on a plain city street, pink and white candy tulips
lay on sculptured chocolate bowls, thin and smooth like porcelain,
hand-painted by the master.
   There are white chocolate swans with long slender necks, and
old-fashioned red velvet hearts, as large and plush as cushions,
stuffed with truffles. Chocolate Cupids float with bows drawn and
hot-lip lollipops beckon for a kiss.
   ``My goal is to create a dream for clients, to fulfill their
fantasies,'' said Schmidt, expressing the same childlike joy as the
hero of the movie ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.''
   Like Wonka, everything Schmidt makes is satisfying and delicious.
Talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes.
   Some of Schmidt's chocolate flowers and shell-like bowls are part
of a touring show of confection art organized by the American Craft
Museum in New York.
   Joseph Schmidt Confections, a 5-year-old love affair of Schmidt
and partner Audrey Ryan, is no ordinary candy store. Its artistic
and tasty creations have delighted Queen Elizabeth, former President
Reagan and thousands of loyal customers.
   Schmidt, who said he's ``49 going on 30,'' once made a chocolate
replica of the Eiffel Tower for the French ambassador and a giant
panda holding bamboo shoots for a Wildlife Foundation dinner with
Prince Phillip.
   It is not the size of Schmidt's creations, though, that make them
so startling.
   Many of his finest works are small, with the attention to detail
of miniature portraits. The petals on long-stemmed chocolate tulips
are as delicately shaped as real tulips.
   The cost of all this effort? Schmidt works about four hours on
each of his sculptured bowls but sells them for only $20. Big
bonbons laced with liqueurs are $1 apiece.
   ``We give away our product because we enjoy it so much,'' said
Ryan, who works almost as long as Schmidt's 18-hour days.
   The two former pastry chefs and a staff of 90 people at their
chocolate factory and retail shop each week turn 40,000 pounds of
premium raw chocolate from Belgium into treats for the sweet of
tooth.
   All that chocolate adds up to a $1 million a year business, Ryan
said.
   Valentine's Day, Easter and Christmas are their biggest holidays,
but it seems every week is special.
   Even Groundhog Day earlier this month was an excuse for candied
fantasies, with the cute chocolate animals springing up from the
shelves.
   ``We've created more of an art form,'' Ryan said. ``That's Joe's
love. He spends every night by himself creating.''
   The biggest problem with Schmidt's Confections is that the
fragile sculptures don't travel well. For the American Craft Museum
show, which is traveling to museums around the country this year and
next, a museum courier had to hand-carry Schmidt's goodies on the
plane.
   ``There is a sense of magic when you see Joseph Schmidt's work,''
said Anthea Zonars, assistant curator at the American Craft Museum.
``You can go into a chocolate shop and find chocolate roses of all
types. But Joseph Schmidt's are remarkable. I think they're
beautiful, and they make my mouth water.''
   Schmidt's sells truffles and bonbons by mail in this country and
in Europe. ``If you want a sculpture, though,'' Ryan said, ``You
have to come here and carry it very carefully.''
