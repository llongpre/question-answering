Desserts in holiday gift catalogues always look tempting. But their prices can 
be hard to swallow. The solution? Make the desserts at home. 
</P>
<P>
What follows are recipes for some of the desserts available in this year's crop 
of mail-order gift catalogues. Some are recipes directly from mail-order 
companies, one comes from a local restaurant, and the rest are facsimiles of 
catalogue desserts developed in The Los Angeles Times Test Kitchen. All make 
delicious gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to prepare the more perishable desserts at the last minute. The Gift 
Catalogue Strudel made with apples and ricotta cheese should be made no sooner 
than one day before giving. The Lemon Cake, Gift Carrot Cake, Chocolate Fudge 
Cake and Macadamia Nut Bread all store well in the refrigerator for about a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few things to remember if you're mailing the desserts. The obvious: 
Be sure to allow plenty of time for mailing cakes cross-country -- especially 
during the holidays. The post office has delivery schedules you can check to 
calculate how many days your package will spend in transit. Using the proper 
mailing container is essential for on-time delivery. Tins are best for cookies. 
Heavy boxes will probably do fine for firm cakes. Perishable desserts such as 
strudel should be packed apropriately with dry ice and sent through a next-day 
delivery service. If in doubt about the proper packing equipment, leave the 
packing to a professional.

</P>
<P>
1/2 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup melted butter or shortening 
</P>
<P>
2 3/4 to 3 cups sifted flour 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons rum 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped blanched almonds 
</P>

Sprinkle dry yeast into warm, not hot, water. Scald milk. Pour into large mixer 
bowl. Add 1/4 cup sugar, salt and melted butter. Cool until just warm. Stir in
