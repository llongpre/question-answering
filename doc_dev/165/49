<LEADPARA>  LAST January, in the middle of a snowy Iowa winter, I felt uninspired by a
multitude of advertisements for ice cream treats. Now that warmer weather
approaches, I've looked at the ads again and noticed two new subtly promoted
products. I imagine they'll be more obvious in the weeks to come.;    Both of
these new "frozen novelties" carry bold yellow "sugar-free" banners on their
packages. Dove's sugar-free Three Musketeers Snack Bars are bite-size morsels
of chocolate-coated ice cream, while Nestle's sugar-free Lite Crunch is a
chocolate-coated "frozen dairy dessert" on a stick.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  On the Label  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     According to Food and Drug Administration policy, the label "sugar-free"
can only be used on foods made without nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners.
Nutritive sweeteners contribute calories. They include sugar, corn syrup,
dextrose, fructose and honey.;    Current FDA regulations also require
"sugar-free" foods to fit the definitions for "low-calorie" or
"calorie-reduced" foods. Nutrition labels of reduced- and low-calorie foods
are supposed to include a nutrient comparison to a similar "regular" food.
Manufacturers of high-calorie sugar-free foods can get around this requirement
by placing a disclaimer on the package stating that the food is not reduced in
calories.;    Labels misleading;  Neither Nestle's sugar-free Lite Crunch nor
Dove's sugar-free Three Musketeers Snack Bars seems to fit the FDA's low- or
reduced-calorie definitions. They don't include comparative nutrient values on
the labels, nor could I find a disclaimer on either. I believe their labeling
is misleading.;    Take "sugar-free" on a package label as another promotional
"red flag." These products are good examples of the problem. Although both
contain no nutritive sweeteners, they are not calorie-free. They include the
carbohydrates polydextrose, maltodextrin and sorbitol. All three contribute
calories. But of greater concern in these sugar-free treats is their fat
content. Both are high in fat, especially the cholesterol-raising saturated
kind.;    Fatty bars; Fat accounts for seven of every 10 calories in
sugar-free Three Musketeers Snack Bars. Granted, each little half-ounce bar
contains only 4 grams of fat. But eat three bars and you've downed 150
calories and as much fat as in 2 teaspoons of margarine. Since the ingredient
list includes cream, whole milk and cocoa butter (chocolate fat) as the
primary fat sources, I expect about two-thirds of the fat to be saturated.;   
Some of the front panels of the Lite Crunch frozen dairy dessert also state
that it is "reduced fat." According to the Nestle consumer information
service, the Lite Crunch dessert has 30 fewer calories and 2 grams less fat
than the regular Crunch dessert. However, fat contributes six of every 10
calories in both bars. Ounce per ounce, both versions have the same amount of
fat, but a Lite Crunch bar weighs half an ounce less.;    Clearly, Nestle
reformulated the original Crunch dessert to eliminate sugar and corn syrup
from the product. Lite Crunch isn't just a smaller version, but I want to see
a real change in the relative amount of fat before I will consider a "reduced
fat" claim legitimate. About two-thirds of the fat in the Lite Crunch dessert
is probably saturated.;    Since fat is the major source of calories in these
sugar-free treats, I cannot think of anyone who would benefit from choosing
them over the regular versions. People with diabetes and high blood
triglycerides should avoid them for their fat, carbohydrate and calorie
content. If you have high blood cholesterol, they're too high in saturated
fat. If you don't have specific diet-related health concerns and your diet has
room for a food with little more nutritional value than a candy bar, I suggest
that you just eat the regular versions.; Dove's Sugar-Free Three Musketeers
