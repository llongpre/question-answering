<LEADPARA>  REMEMBER when the only ice cream novelties were ice cream sandwiches,
Creamsicles and drumsticks? Now, there are so many varieties even the sticks
are different. The sticks that Haagen-Dazs uses look like flattened water
wings.;    But there's nothing flat about the Haagen-Dazs Caramel Almond
Crunch Bar. This bar has rich vanilla ice cream wrapped around a layer of
caramel and covered with almond-studded milk chocolate. The chocolate in this
and all the Haagen-Dazs novelties is Callebaut Belgian chocolate.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Haagen-Dazs Peanut-Butter Crunch Bar combines chocolate, crushed
peanuts and a center section of peanut butter. The taste wasn't bad, but when
I bit into it, the center peanut butter cylinder flew in the other direction.;
   In case you missed your morning Rice Krispies, Vanilla Crisp Crunch Bar has
crisped rice in its chocolate coating. This is one of those ideas that
probably sounded great when first conceived, but doesn't work, at least not
enough to make you run out and buy it.;    All the Haagen-Dazs crunch bars are
2.1 ounces and come in single or three-bar packs. Single bars cost about 99
cents, three-packs about $2.59.;    If you want the taste of pure,
unadulterated chocolate (well, slightly adulterated anyway -- it has some
cream and egg in it), try Haagen-Dazs Fudge Bar Pops. Fudgy and delicious.
Orange &amp; Cream Bar Pops are a '90s version of the Creamsicle. In this
incarnation, eggy vanilla ice cream is covered with orange sorbet. The pops
are light and refreshing though not exactly low-calorie. Both pops come three
to a box (2.5 ounces each) and cost $2.59.;    Butterfinger, never one of my
favorite candy bars (I was an Almond Joy and a Mounds guy), has a new ice
cream bar. It has a nice, caramel crust that's not too sweet and a decent ice
cream center. But if you're squeamish, don't read the ingredient list.
Butterfinger Ice Cream Bars cost $2.79 for a six-pack of 2.5-ounce bars.;   
Nestle Crunch has two ice cream bars. Vanilla Crunch Lite ($2.49 for six
2.5-ounce bars) is sweetened with NutraSweet and is 95 percent fat-free.
Unfortunately it's also 99 percent boring, and slightly crystalline to boot
(guess they didn't put enough stabilizers in). Chocolate Crunch ($2.69 for six
three-ounce bars) not only has a richer, more genuine ice cream flavor, but
the outer coating is crisper and sweeter, much more like the Nestle Crunch
candy bar.;    The Champ ($3.09 for three 4.2-ounce bars) was introduced last
year but I couldn't find it in the markets I checked. It's reminiscent of the
old-fashioned ice cream bars with two improvements. It has a darker, denser
chocolate coating and an inner layer of Spanish peanuts.  </TEXT>
