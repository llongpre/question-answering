<LEADPARA>  MOVE over, croissants! There's a new pastry capturing America's attention when
it comes to a tasty snack. It's called rugelach (pronounced ROO-gelah).;  
Well, it's not really new. Until recently, rugelach were a well-kept secret of
regular shoppers at Jewish bakeries, where this delicious pastry is one of the
most popular items. But the word is out. Suddenly rugelach are appearing in
fancy mail-order catalogs, in gourmet food shops and in many supermarkets.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So what are rugelach? Are they cookies or are they pastries? Actually,
they're sort of both. They're made of pastry and are served like cookies with
coffee, tea or milk. Rugelach look like mini croissants. At least, some of
them do. Others are cylindrical in shape, rather like miniature pains au
chocolat (a pastry made from croissant dough with a chocolate filling). In
fact, rugelach have a lot in common with croissants -- they are rich, tender
and flaky.;   But rugelach have an important advantage over croissants. They
are very easy to make.;   Unlike classic croissants, rugelach always have a
filling. The traditional filling is simply "sprinkles" -- you scatter chopped
nuts, cinnamon, sugar and raisins over the dough. With rugelach's new
popularity, many filling variations have been developed, and now rugelach come
in such flavors as chocolate, strawberry, apricot, cheese and raspberry.;
CREAM CHEESE DOUGH FOR RUGELACH; 6  ounces cream cheese (bar type, not
spreadable type); 1/2  pound cold unsalted butter; 2  cups flour; 1/4 
teaspoon salt; 1/3  cup sour cream; 1  teaspoon water (optional);  Cut cream
cheese into tablespoon-size pieces and let soften at room temperature. Cut
butter into small pieces of about 1/2 tablespoon and keep them cold until
ready to use.;   Place flour, salt and butter in bowl of food processor and
process with on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cream
cheese and sour cream, distributing them evenly over mixture. Process with
on/off turns until dough just holds together. Add 1 teaspoon water if
necessary. Wrap dough in plastic wrap, press together into a ball and flatten
to a disk. Refrigerate 4 hours or up to 2 days.; (hbox);    TRADITIONAL
RUGELACH WITH CINNAMON-WALNUT-RAISIN FILLING; Cream Cheese Dough for Rugelach
(recipe above); 1/2  cup sugar; 1  tablespoon ground cinnamon; 1  cup walnuts,
finely chopped; 1/2  cup dark raisins, chopped;  Prepare dough and
refrigerate. Lightly butter 2 or 3 baking sheets. Mix sugar and cinnamon for
filling.;   Divide dough into 4 pieces. Press each portion into a round, then
flatten it. Roll it into 9-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Sprinkle 1/4 of
sugar-cinnamon mixture (about 2 tablespoons) all over circle, then sprinkle
1/4 of nuts and raisins near outer edge of circle. Press with rolling pin so
they adhere to dough.;   Using heavy knife, cut circle into 12 wedges, making
each cut with sharp movement of heel of knife. Tightly roll up each wedge from
wide end to point. Be sure filling is enclosed, as raisins can burn if
exposed. Place cookies on prepared baking sheets with points of triangles
facing down, spacing them about 1-inch apart. Curve each to crescent shape, if
desired. Refrigerate while shaping more cookies. Refrigerate all at least 20
minutes before baking. (Unbaked cookies can be frozen.);   Bake at 350 degrees
22 to 25 minutes or until light golden. Cool on racks. Makes 48.; (hbox);   
CHOCOLATE CHIP RUGELACH; Cream Cheese Dough for Rugelach (recipe above); 1 
cup mini semisweet chocolate chips;  Prepare dough and refrigerate. Lightly
butter 2 or 3 baking sheets. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Press each portion
into a square, then flatten it. Roll it into 9- to 9 1/2-inch square. Trim
edges. Cut into 3 equal strips, then cut each strip into 3 pieces. You will
have 9 squares.;   Spoon 1 teaspoon chocolate chips on each square about 1/2
inch from edge nearest you. Spread chips in row along edge so they are as
close together as possible but are in a single layer. Fold over edge of dough
nearest you to cover chips. Tightly roll up dough, jelly-roll fashion, toward
other side. It will look like a thin cylinder. Cut each cylinder in two, with
heel of heavy knife.;   Place cookies on baking sheets and refrigerate while
