   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., hungry for a bite of the rich
chocolate market, has asked the Food and Drug Administration
to approve a low-calorie fat that could replace cocoa butter
in candy bars.
   The ingredient, called caprenin, has the characteristics
of cocoa butter and can be used in candy and confectionary
coatings. But it has only five calories a gram instead of the
nine calories a gram in other fats. That means a one-ounce
chocolate bar made with caprenin would have 120 calories
instead of 160, P&amp;G said.

   Chocolate manufacturers have been searching for a
low-calorie fat for candy, so P&amp;G could have a winner if
caprenin is approved. "Americans have a love affair with
chocolate," says Bonita Austin, analyst with Wertheim
Schroder in New York. "Anything that reduces the guilt could
be a big hit."
   But the only way to win a piece of the $4.9 billion
chocolate market is if candy made with caprenin tastes as
rich as the real thing. "We'll eat fish, salads with no
dressing and bread without butter, but we want our
chocolate," says Joan Steuer, president of Chocolate
Marketing Inc., a Los Angeles consulting firm. "It's one of
the last indulgences people have." The average U.S. chocolate
consumption is 11 pounds per person a year, she said.
   If the ingredient is approved by the FDA, P&amp;G will
manufacture caprenin through a joint venture with Grindsted,
a Kansas City, Mo., maker of emulsifiers and stabilizers, and
sell it to candy makers.
   The Cincinnati-based consumer products company has briefed
candy makers about caprenin but wouldn't discuss which
companies might buy it. Among major candy and chocolate
makers, officials at Hershey Foods Corp. said they are aware
of caprenin but declined to comment further. At Mars Inc.'s
M&amp;M/Mars, a spokesman declined to comment on the ingredient.
   Selling caprenin as an ingredient rather than developing
its own chocolate products from scratch could make sense for
P&amp;G, given the dominance of Mars, Hershey and Nestles in the
candy market. Besides, P&amp;G has a mixed record in the food and
beverage business. The senior executive in charge of that
business resigned recently, and people close to the company
say P&amp;G is considering selling parts of the business.
   P&amp;G, the maker of Crisco shortening, has done fat research
for decades but has been stalled in attempts to get a slice
of the low-fat food market. While other manufacturers'
products, such as Monsanto Co.'s Simplesse, have won FDA
approval, P&amp;G's fat substitute olestra has remained under
agency review since 1987.
   P&amp;G appears increasingly concerned about the fate of
olestra. Company lobbyists persuaded two Cincinnati
congressmen to introduce a bill last week in the House of
Representatives to protect certain patents on olestra for 10
years after the FDA approves it.
   Caprenin could have a speedier trip through the FDA
because it is made of fatty acids already found in other
fats. So P&amp;G filed a "generally regarded as safe," or GRAS,
petition, not the more extensive food additive petition
required for olestra, which is a calorie-free ingredient not
found anywhere in existing foods.
   Some scientists have questioned olestra's safety. Rats in
some tests developed tumors and leukemia, among other
diseases, according to the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a consumer-advocacy group. P&amp;G maintains that
olestra is safe for humans.
   P&amp;G said it has been working with the FDA on caprenin
since 1989. The company has done three digestion and
absorption studies on caprenin, also known as
caprocaprylobehenin, on rats, hamsters and humans and found
no side effects, Wendy Jacques, a P&amp;G spokeswoman said. The
calorie reduction in caprenin comes from one of three fatty
acids that is only partly absorbed in the body. The other two
fatty acids give it the characteristics of cocoa butter, P&amp;G
officials said.
   But the FDA under its new commissioner, David Kessler, has
proved to be tougher with food manufacturers. P&amp;G has already
tangled with the FDA twice this year, over the use of the
word "fresh" on its Citrus Hill orange juice and on
no-cholesterol claims on Crisco. In both cases, the company
had to bow to the agency and relabel the products.
   If caprenin gets FDA approval, it will take a while to
persuade candy makers to tinker with recipes of big brands
such as Snickers or M&amp;Ms. "The lesser of two hurdles is in
Washington," says Gary Stibel of New England Consulting
Group. "The greater hurdle is in the mouth."
