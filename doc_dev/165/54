   Life has gotten sweeter for chocolate
lovers, thanks to a drop in cocoa prices that has translated into
bigger candy bars and could mean future price-cutting promotions.
   The price of raw cocoa _ which typically constitutes up to 20
percent of a typical chocolate bar _ has fallen to five-year lows.
   While that hasn't meant direct reductions in the cost of a
Snickers or Hershey bar at the corner newsstand or vending machine,
it has helped candy makers offer a bigger bar at the same price.
   The near-month cocoa future traded on the Coffee, Sugar and
Cocoa Exchange in New York traded at $1,552 per ton on Thursday,
down from the mid-July price of $2,175. Analysts say abundant
supplies and rising production have depressed prices.
   But cheaper cocoa doesn't directly translate into cheaper bars
because cocoa and chocolate don't have the direct price
relationship of, for example, oil and gasoline or beans and coffee,
industry analysts say.
   While cocoa and its by-products constitute up to 20 percent of a
chocolate bar, about 50 percent of the candy is sugar and the rest
milk, nuts, vanilla or other ingredients, said Susan Smith, a
spokeswoman for the Chocolate Manufacturers Association.
   Hackettstown-based M&amp;M-Mars, a privately-held company considered
to be the nation's argest candy bar maker, has increased the size
of two popular products by about 8 percent in recent years.
   Last fall, M&amp;M-Mars enlarged its Milky Way bar as it had done
with its Snickers bar _ the nation's biggest seller, according to
industry estimates _ the previous year.
   Hans Fiuczynski, a spokesman for M&amp;M-Mars, said the lower cocoa
price ``augmented and abetted'' the decision to increase the bar
size, although he said similar moves by other candy makers also
played a major role.
   ``We did what other people did, not necessarily because of the
price of raw materials,'' Fiuczynski said.
   A spokesman for Hershey Chocolate U.S.A., in Hershey, Pa., said
a drop in cocoa prices and stabilization in the cost of other
ingredients contributed to its decision to boost the size of its
various chocolate bars by 10 percent to 14 percent in July 1986.
   But the price of cocoa ``doesn't have that direct an effect on
us'' in terms of the cost of its products, said spokesman Carl
Anderson.
   Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Inc., said recent cocoa prices could be considered the lowest in
decades if inflation was taken into account.
   Badenhop predicted the increased cash flow resulting from
cheaper commodity costs could show up in still-bigger bars and more
promotions such as coupons or discounted brands.
   Retailers probably won't pass on their savings to consumers by
cutting the price of an individual chocolate bar, but are likely to
do it by offering a bigger product for the same price, discount
coupons or through other promotions, Badenhop said.
   ``We've been told through the grapevine that has happened with
some of the companies,'' said Ms. Smith.
   Consumers may see direct savings in products such as packages of
candy bars sold in supermarkets or bags of small chocolates, said
Ms. Smith.
