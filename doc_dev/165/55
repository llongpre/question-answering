<LEADPARA>  HOW many of you have sampled a new dish or prepared a new recipe and come away
slightly disappointed? You felt the ingredients or new technique were fine but
something was missing.;    That "missing ingredient" is the personal touch
that each cook adds.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This trait, I think, accounts for the vast variety of recipes we get from
readers replying to a general request. You adapt recipes to suit your personal
tastes, too. When Pauline Acker of Sunnyvale requested a recipe for chewy
oatmeal bars filled with chocolate chips, the replies helped confirm my
theory.;    Diane Wolak, a home economics teacher in San Jose, sent this
recipe with a few personal preferences included.; OATMEAL CARMELITAS;  Crust:;
1 cup flour; 1 cup quick-cooking oats;  3/4 cup brown sugar, firmly packed; 
1/2 teaspoon soda;  1/4 teaspoon salt;  3/4 cup melted butter;   Filling:; 1
6-ounce package chocolate chips;  3/4 cup walnuts or pecans;  3/4 cup caramel
ice cream topping; 3 tablespoons flour;   Combine all ingredients for crust,
blending with wooden spoon or mixer to form crumbs. Press about half the crumb
mixture into bottom of 11-by-7-inch pan. Bake at 350 degrees for about 10
minutes. Set aside.;    Sprinkle crust with chocolate chips and nuts. Blend
ice cream topping with flour, mixing well. Drizzle over chocolate chips and
nuts. Sprinkle with remaining crumb mixture as evenly as possible. Bake about
20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool about 1 to 2 hours before cutting into
bars.;    Wolak adds "Good but rich and full of calories. I usually double the
crust portion of the recipe and leave everything else the same. Double recipe
to make the crust and single recipe for the topping. I bake it in an
11-by-15-inch jelly roll pan."; (hbox);    Judy Livny of San Jose says she got
her recipe from her friend, Carol, who is the best cookie baker she knows.; 
OATMEAL FUDGE BARS; 2 cups brown sugar, firmly packed;  3/4 cup margarine; 2
teaspoons vanilla; 2 1/2 cups flour; 3 cups oats; 1 12-ounce package chocolate
chips; 1 can sweetened condensed milk; 2 tablespoons margarine;   Cream brown
sugar and margarine together. Add the vanilla, flour and oats. Heat chips,
condensed milk and margarine until blended. Press two-thirds oat mixture into
greased 10-by-13-inch pan. Spread chocolate mixture on top ("Nuts or raisins
can be added to the chocolate mixture, if desired," adds Livny). Sprinkle
remaining oat mixture on top. Bake at 350 degrees until light brown or about a
half an hour.; CAMPING FARE; Derry Cornelius of Redding supplies this recipe
to Barbara Gregory of Gilroy who wanted to add to her on-the-road recipes for
RV camping.;  ONE POT DINNER;  1/2 pound ground beef;  3/4 pound bacon, cut in
small pieces; 1 cup onion, chopped; 2 15-ounce cans pork and beans; 1 16-ounce
can kidney beans, drained; 1 16-ounce can butter beans (large limas), drained;
1 cup ketchup;  1/4 cup brown sugar; 1 tablespoons liquid smoke; 3 tablespoons
white vinegar; 1 teaspoon salt;  Dash of pepper;  Brown ground beef, drain and
place in crock pot or other large kettle. Brown bacon and onions. Drain and
add to pot. Add remaining ingredients. Stir together well. Cover and cook on
low heat 4 to 6 hours. ( You can substitute barbecue sauce for the mixture of
ketchup, brown sugar, liquid smoke and vinegar.) Serves 6 to 8 as a main
dish.; CALLS FOR HELP; Pam Stephens' San Jose garden overflows and she wants
to know how to make ratatouille with eggplant, zucchini and tomatoes.  </TEXT>
