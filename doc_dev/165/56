<LEADPARA>  Come Valentine's Day, the Japanese say it with chocolates. But in a nation
renowned for absorbing, assimilating and altering other cultures' customs,
women, only, give the sweets to men, only.;    The men return the favor, sort
of, a month later, on what is called White Day. The gift of choice then is
panties -- white, of course.  </LEADPARA>

BETTER THAN LOVE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But not all Valentine's Day chocolates, by a long shot, mean "I love you"
or even "be my Valentine." At least half of the $426 million worth of candy
expected to be sold by Thursday comes with an implicit but ringingly clear
message of obligation, not affection, along the lines of:;    "You're my boss
(or colleague) and since this is a recognized occasion for giving chocolate,
I'd better give you some. Besides, everyone else is doing the same thing.";   
And what do the panties mean? Sometimes, the only message is the obvious. But
more often the idea is something like:;    "Since you gave me a box of
chocolates and because I'm your boss (or colleague), here's a pair of undies
because it's kind of a humorous thing to do, don't you think? Besides,
everyone else is doing the same thing.";    As might be expected under these
circumstances, spontaneity and enthusiasm wear a little thin.;    "Each year,
there are another couple of guys I've got to add to my list and it's really
giving me a headache," a smartly dressed young woman groused to a friend as
they loaded small boxes of chocolates into wicker baskets at the swank
Mitsukoshi department store in Tokyo's Ginza.;    So dominant is the theme of
giving-through-guilt that such candy is known as giri choco, meaning
"obligation chocolate." And, it follows, White Day panties are called giri
shortsu.;    Confectioners readily acknowledge that they cultivate the sense
of duty to boost business.;    "If it weren't for giri choco, the Valentine's
Day sales would be reduced by at least 50 percent," said Masahisa Uchino,
director of the Chocolate and Cocoa Association of Japan.;    The take this
Valentine's Day is expected to reach $430 million, about 12 percent of the
industry's annual total. According to a poll just done by Morozoff
Confectioners, the average single female office worker in Tokyo will spend
about $50 on chocolates for 10 male colleagues. But many spend far more, for
up to 40 men.;    Of course, not all chocolate in Japan changes hands for
reasons less than the fully heartfelt. Sweets for those one is sweet on are
known as honmei choco, meaning "sweetheart chocolates." And, as is often the
case in Japan, the difference between delectable goods given out of love or
out of obligation can be determined by the price tag.;    Midori Hirota, who
was considering an exquisitely wrapped box of La Tour d'Argent, imported from
France, and costing 11,000 yen (about $85), seemed startled when asked if it
was giri or honmei.;    "It's for my boyfriend, of course," she said.;    For
those women who want to leave no doubt, the Japanese genius for marketing
ideas of foreign origin has come to the rescue. This year, the Matsuya
department store is offering a "Ginza Message Seat and Valentine Dinner" at
which couples are to be seated at windows in a selected restaurant, from where
they'll watch their prepaid expression of affection flashed on an outdoor
electric sign.;    Other firms are ferrying couples to gourmet meals in
chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royces. The top of the upscale market is an overnight
"Valentine Concert Cruise" aboard the love boat Fujimaru. At about $1,000 a
couple, said Ayako Yokoyama of Mitsui Shipping Lines, all 250 places aboard
were quickly snapped up.;    So, what's a woman to expect in return for all
this trouble and expense? Not much, it seems. For White Day, men spend only
about one-third of what women spend for Valentine's.;    When White Day was
created, a decade or so ago, the chocolate industry meant it to promote sales
of white chocolate. That never really took off, and merchandisers worked
things around to white panties.;    But then, it turned out, Japanese men were
shy.;    "Yeah, I guess I'm a little embarrassed about walking into the
lingerie department and choosing panties," admitted Yasuhiro Honda, a bank
clerk. To ease such pain, some stores have introduced technology.;    "The
panty vending machine has proven very successful since we installed it two
years ago," said Tatsushi Ichikawa, an assistant buyer at the Isetan
department store. "But panties have gotten sort of ordinary by now. This year,
we're putting panties, chocolates and a bar of soap together in a cute
package."  </TEXT>
