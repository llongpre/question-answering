If you really want to wow friends with your microwave prowess, try this 
drop-dead chocolate mousse. 
</P>
<P>
It looks -- and tastes -- as if you'd slaved over a hot stove all day. And yet 
it needs only minutes in the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
But first, a few pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never double this recipe as it may curdle or boil over. Whenever you need a 
double amount, prepare two batches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never try to hurry cooking of egg-thickened desserts by upping the power 
level to HIGH (100% power). In ovens of 700 watts or more, egg mixtures may 
cook more evenly on 10% to 20% power. Whenever the mixture seems in danger of 
curdling, reduce the power level at once. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always watch egg mixtures carefully as they microwave and check for 
doneness after minimum cooking time (microwave times will vary according to the 
oven's power). When it comes to delicate egg-thickened mixtures, seconds, not 
minutes, can spell the difference between success and failure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remember that egg-thickened mixtures continue to cook as they stand, so 
remove from the microwave the instant they test done. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To stop cooking of egg mixtures cold, quick-chill in an ice bath or whisk 
briskly for several seconds.

CHOCOLATE MOUSSE 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
3 eggs, separated 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate curls and/or toasted blanched almonds, optional 
</P>
<P>
Melt chocolate with water in uncovered 1-quart bowl by microwaving on MEDIUM 
(50% power) 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Beat until smooth. Whisk small amount of 
chocolate into egg yolks, mix back into bowl and microwave, uncovered, on 
MEDIUM-LOW (30% power) 1 to 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Whisk again and transfer to cold 2-quart bowl. Stir in vanilla and cool to 
lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
Beat cream with powdered sugar until soft mounds form. Fold into chocolate 
mixture. 
</P>
<P>
In separate bowl, beat egg whites to soft peaks and fold in, small amount at 
time, until no white streaks show. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon into serving dish, cover and chill 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Decorate 
with chocolate curls and/or toasted blanched almonds. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: For Frozen Chocolate Mousse, prepare mousse as directed and chill. 
Spoon into parfait glasses. Cover and freeze until firm. Let stand 10 to 15 
minutes at room temperature before serving. 
</P>
<P>
How to Make Chocolate Curls: Unwrap 1-ounce square chocolate (any type). Place 
on plate and microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM (50% power) 15 to 20 seconds until 
just warm. Using swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, shave off curls. If chocolate 
hardens, simply rewarm. 
</P>
<P>
How to Toast Almonds: Spread 1/2 to 2 cups blanched, slivered almonds on 9- to 
11-inch pie plate, depending on amount. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% 
power), allowing 3 to 4 minutes for 1/2 cup and 4 to 6 minutes for 1 to 2 cups, 
stirring once or twice, until lightly browned. Let stand, uncovered, 2 to 3 
minutes. Nuts will continue browning as they stand, so don't overcook. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.
