If I have my way, 1993 will be a no-pudding Christmas. I shall concentrate
my culinary efforts on first and main courses and end with the simple
splendour of fine cheeses and a personal variation on les treize desserts -
a selection of favourite fruits and sweetmeats.
Elvas plums, marrons glaces and stem ginger in syrup are the triumvirate of
sweetmeats without which no Christmas sideboard looks dressed properly.
Chestnuts and ginger have never been hard to come by, thank goodness, but
Elvas plums, traditionally imported along with port for the Christmas
market, have been elusive in recent years. That they are now on sale again
is cause to rejoice - and is due in part to the Weekend FT.
A year ago, I wrote in a column that I hoped Elvas plums would, unlike the
previous year, be obtainable for Christmas 1992. A reader, an Englishman
living in Portugal, rang me straight away. He told me Elvas production had
plummeted, distribution in Portugal was erratic and exports had stopped. But
he and his family had bought one of the two factory farms still operating
and hoped to revitalise it.
Their first harvest, sugar-preserved in the traditional artisan manner and
packed into wooden boxes lined with lace-paper, was ready for despatch. They
would be happy, he said, to supply my local delicatessen and any other shops
I might like to suggest.
Fired by the enthusiastic reception for these tentative consignments, the
company Conservas Rainha Santa has redoubled its efforts this year. And
providing you buy soon, your sideboard need not lack Elvas plums this
Christmas. For your nearest stockist, contact the importer, Porters (tel:
0423-322323; fax 0423-322335)
Figs are another fruit I associate strongly with Christmas. In Amalfi, they
are split and stuffed with chopped walnuts and tangerine peel, threaded onto
skewers interleaved with bay, and dried. Exquisite but not, so far as I
know, available in the UK.
Alternative fig delicacies that are on sale in Britain include southern
Italian delicacies imported by Patricia Michelson of La Fromagerie, in north
London (071-359-7440). Available from her shop and by post are aromatised
preserved figs; figs soaked in rum and coated with dark chocolate; plain
figs (also clementines) coated in thick dark chocolate; and a stunning
confection known as fig balls.
The size of small cricket balls, these are dried figs soaked in honey and
fruit juice to make them agreeably moist, packed into a round, and wrapped
in vine leaves. She recommends them with cheese, and adds that they could
possibly be used as an alternative Christmas tree decoration.
Chocolate-coated Calabrian figs can also be bought from the Algerian Coffee
Stores in central London (tel. 071-437-2480, fax 437-5470).
From Spain come fig wheels - small, round cakes of pressed figs layered with
almonds and sprinkled lightly with aniseed. A prune and walnut version is
also available from the same importer, Brindisa, which can be contacted for
your nearest stockist (tel: 071-403-0282; fax 071-403- 5044).
Brindisa also imports some lovely turron or torro made by a Catalan company
called Alemany. Torro Granulat (known as Jijona by some other producers) is
an addictive, halva-like ground almond bar with lovely texture. Torro
Massapa crema is a smooth almond paste flavoured with vanilla under a burnt
sugar coating. The nuts are top quality, making it more nutty than sweet.
Returning to something more British, two companies vie in the 'favourite
fudge' stakes: the Toffee Shop in Penrith, Cumbria (0768-62008) and Wards of
Adisham, Kent (0227-720596). Both sell the lovely stuff by post, and fudge
fans may consider acquiring a box from each for a little serious comparative
tasting this Christmas.
As for chocolates, Carlo Melchior, of Chittlehampton, makes very fine
truffles and praline. For families who may feel cheated if denied plum
pudding, a witty solution could be to serve individual ones such as
Melchior's gobstopper-size chocolate truffle plum puds filled with
brandy-soaked festive fruits and topped with a sprig of marzipan holly.
Melchior also confects amazing chestnut chocolates: dark chocolate filled
with soft praline, encased in a green almond paste husk. (tel: 0769-540643;
fax 0884-761115).
On a less calorific note, few things are prettier or easier to make at home
than physalis, or cape gooseberry petits fours. Pull back the paper lantern
petals gently to reveal the small orange berry and dip it into melted
chocolate glossed with a little butter (or into warm fondant, if you
prefer). I like to leave about half the fruits undipped to show off their
bright colour and the unadulterated sweet-sour taste.
Christmas would not be Christmas without pyramids of clementines - so much
more intensely fruity than tangerines - and bowls of walnuts and hazels. Now
is the time to search junk shops for strong and attractive antique
nutcrackers. Few things are more irritating than just one pair between a
party of would-be nut-eaters.
Tissue-wrapped amarettis have been my favourite Christmas biscuits in recent
years, but the chicest choice this year will undoubtedly be the brand-new
Duchy Originals - gingered biscuits which are just beginning to trickle into
the shops.
Organic quality and royal label apart, these are a high-quality nibble and
deserve to be savoured slowly. They are pleasingly crisp and not too sweet,
with an agreeable background nuttiness of malted wheat studded with
succulent chunks of faintly lemony Australian stem ginger.
The biscuits are made by Shipton Mill near Tetbury, which can be contacted
for the name of your nearest stockist (0666-505050; fax 0666-504666).
