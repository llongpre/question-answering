<LEADPARA>  MANY dogs wolf down as much chocolate as they can find. That's why the sweet
treat poses such a threat to them.;    Eating even a little chocolate can
create a severe reaction in a small dog. Dogs are more likely than cats to
become poisoned by eating chocolate, because felines are generally more
discriminating eaters.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The most dangerous delicacy is baking chocolate, which contains almost 10
times the active ingredient, theobromine, of milk chocolate. One ounce of
cooking chocolate or part of a one-pound bag of candy-coated chocolate pieces
can be life-threatening to a pet weighing up to 10 pounds.;    A dog's
reactions to chocolate range from vomiting and diarrhea to seizures and
death.;    Other possible side effects include restlessness, frequent
urination, irregular heartbeat, overactivity and tremors.;    Symptoms may not
appear for several hours. Even after the pet has been treated by a
veterinarian, complete recovery may take several days.;    If it is known or
suspected that a pet has eaten a large amount of chocolate, contact a
veterinarian immediately.  </TEXT>
