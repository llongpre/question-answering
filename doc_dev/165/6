   White chocolate will be the hot chocolate of the
'90s, food experts at a convention of chefs say. The drink of choice
at coffeehouses and ski lodges soon may be white chocolate
cappuccino.
   Europeans have enjoyed white chocolate for years, but the
confection has gone largely ignored in the United States. Because
federal regulations forbid the term ``white chocolate,''
manufacturers were wary of marketing the candy. The success of
Nestle's White Alpine candy bar, introduced in 1985, has changed all
that.
   Marty Friedman, editor of the Florida-based New Product News,
named white chocolate as one of the top 15 new food trends during
this week's International Association of Food Professionals
convention.
   ``It's the last unexplored avenue in the chocolate world,'' said
Janice Wald Henderson, West Coast editor of Chocolatier magazine and
author of a white chocolate cookbook. ``White chocolate was the last
stone unturned.''
   Henderson's cookbook contains recipes for white chocolate
waffles, white chocolate pound cake, white hot chocolate, white
chocolate bread pudding and white chocolate German cake.
   ``It's a big hit now,'' said Liz Echendia, co-publisher of The
Confectioner, a national trade publication. ``It's a new taste that
hasn't been around before.''
   White chocolate, introduced in Switzerland after World War I,
comes from the cocoa bean and differs from milk chocolate and dark
chocolate only in that it lacks a liquid chocolate extract, the
substance that gives standard chocolate its ``bitter, sharper
flavor,'' according to chocolate experts.
   ``It has many of the flavor notes of milk chocolate but it has a
lighter, cleaner taste,'' said Carl Anderson, a vice president of
Nestle Foods Corp. in White Plains, N.Y., where the 40-cent Alpine
White with Almonds bar has become one of the top-selling 25 candy
bars in the country.
   Nestle circumvented the white chocolate definition problem by
describing the contents of the bar as ``what Europeans call `white
chocolate''' on the back of the label. Otherwise, it's referred to
only as ``Alpine White.''
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if deep down inside, people think it
has less calories than other chocolate,'' said Friedman. ``It looks
so pristine and white. It's one of the biggest successes in the
candy world.''
   Nestle also sells white chocolate chips, white chocolate-coated
ice cream bars and bulk white chocolate for individual consumers and
candy manufacturers.
   Anderson attributed the popularity of white chocolate to a
general trend among consumers for ``lighter food.''
   ``You're seeing a move away from harder brown liquors to rum and
vodka, you'll be seeing lighter soft drinks, people are eating more
fish and chicken than beef,'' he said. ``We have some research
showing that thewhite color and cleaner taste is appealing.''
   Henderson also has a theory about why people like white chocolate.
   ``I love the texture, it's exceptionally creamy and rich,'' she
said. ``That's what good desserts are all about. Otherwise, eat an
apple.''
