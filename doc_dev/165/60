CADBURY Schweppes is to bring chocolate pandas to the children of China as
part of a Pounds 20m project to establish the group as a leading provider of
confectionery to the People's Republic.
China's growing free market culture has convinced several western
manufacturers that Chinese children will be as susceptible to sweet things
as those elsewhere. Coca-Cola, which has 13 bottling plants in China,
earlier this year said it was investing a further Dollars 150m (Pounds 101m)
in the country.
Cadbury says that the 1.2bn Chinese consumed only 11,000 tonnes of chocolate
in 1991. In the same year, Britons consumed 507,000 tonnes. Cadbury's taste
tests in China had convinced it that the 20 local and imported brands
available represented a mere nibble at the market's potential.
The UK-based group has set up a joint venture partnership with the Beijing
General Corporation for Agriculture, Industry and Commerce (Baic) to build a
manufacturing plant near the Chinese capital. Cadbury will have a 75 per
cent stake and management control over the venture. The plant will begin
production in 1995 with an initial annual capacity of about 5,000 tonnes.
Baic, which is linked to the Chinese agriculture ministry, controls
Beijing's milk supply and dairy processing facilities. Before local
production begins, chocolate will be imported from the UK and Australia,
where the group already sells chocolate pandas. Other products on sale will
be Cadbury's Dairy Milk, Hazelnut, Roast Almond, Chocolate Eclairs and
Cadbury Drinking Chocolate.
All products sold in China will carry the Cadbury name in both English and
Mandarin. A phonetic translation of Cadbury into its Mandarin equivalent, Ji
Bai Li, means 'luck plus hundreds of benefits'.
