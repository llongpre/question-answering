DEAR SOS: I am planning to write a small article on the history of the Toll 
House Cookie for our inter-office newsletter, since everyone is familiar with 
that popular treat. Do you have any information on the subject? 
</P>
<P>
 -- SUSAN 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SUSAN: According to the Nestle Co., the trademarked cookie got its name 
from an old toll house on the outskirts of Whitman, Mass. Built in 1709 at the 
halfway point between Boston and New Bedford, Mass., the toll house became a 
haven for weary travelers who stopped for food, drink and rest while they 
waited for a change of horses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, the old toll house was purchased by a couple named Wakefield (their 
first name has been lost), who turned the house into the Toll House Inn. Mrs. 
Wakefield experimented with a Colonial cookie called the butter drop do, but 
added tiny bits of semisweet chocolate to the cookie dough, half expecting them 
to melt. Instead, the bits of chocolate held their shape, softening just 
slightly to a creamy texture. Mrs. Wakefield named her discovery the Toll House 
Cookie. 
</P>
<P>
Later, with Mrs. Wakefield's permission, Nestle put the recipe on the wrapper 
of their semisweet chocolate bar. As popularity grew, Nestle, seeking ways to 
make cooking with bits of chocolate easier, started producing a scored 
chocolate bar accompanied by a chopper for cutting the chocolate into small 
bits. In 1939, Nestle offered little pieces of chocolate in ready-to-use 
packages, calling the product Semi-Sweet Real Chocolate Morsels.

<P>

creamy. Beat in eggs.

and nuts. Divide dough into 24 to 30 pieces for medium cookies or 12 to 15 
pieces for large cookies. 
</P>
<P>
Form each into ball and place on ungreased baking sheet. Lightly press into 3- 
to 4-inch patty for large cookies, leaving 2 inches between each cookie. Bake 
at 375 degrees 5 to 7 minutes for small cookies and 10 to 12 minutes for large 
cookies. Makes 24 to 30 small cookies or 12 to 15 large cookies.

DEAR SOS: I'm very upset about losing a Times' Food Section "My Best Recipe" 
for flank steak marinated with soy sauce and other ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 -- F.M.L. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR F.M.L: Cheer up. The lost recipe, shared by Ellin N. Crawford of West 
Hollywood in 1985, is yours once again. Actually it's a fine recipe for using a 
tender meat that's also lower in fat than many beef cuts. 
</P>
<P>
