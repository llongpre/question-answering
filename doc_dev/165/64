Diet-minded sweet freaks know that the best way to deal with candy and pastry 
shops is to think of goodies as artworks. You can look at chocolate roses, 
gingerbread horses and marzipan pineapples to your heart's delight. You can 
love gummy bears and sugar Day of the Dead skulls as well as you love Wayne 
Thiebaud's luscious cake paintings or Giuseppe Arcimboldo's bizarre 
fruit-and-vegetable portraits. But you can't eat very many sugary treats if you 
value your figure and your teeth. 
</P>
<P>
No will power is required, however, to enjoy "The Confectioner's Art," an 
international exhibition of sweet edibles at the California Museum of Science 
and Industry in Exposition Park (to July 29). Plexiglass cases protect the 
show's confections (and your figure), which display the history and techniques 
of using sugar and chocolate as artistic media. 
</P>
<P>
This is not an eater-friendly arrangement, but the precautions may be 
unnecessary. For one thing, some of the confections appear to be suffering from 
age and travel. They looked fresher last November, when the exhibition opened 
at the elegant American Craft Museum in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, who would want to destroy Rosemary Littman's Wall Street Journal cake 
or the cake shaped into a big pair of Converse sneakers? Would you really bite 
into Dolph Gotelli's wooden chair inlaid with colored candies or Peter Rocha's 
jelly bean "painting" of the Statue of Liberty? Could you bear to ruin a 
platter of lifelike marzipan fish or a chocolate re-creation of a 12th-Century 
Spanish tapestry? These creations weren't made to be devoured; they were 
crafted for visual delectation. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say the sweet wonders are artworks in the most elevated sense of 
the word, but they are wonderful curiosities. The "art" in the exhibition title 
refers to the high degree of skill and ingenuity required to make the 
confections. Consider such achievements as a chocolate Monopoly set, a bouquet 
of pastel chocolate tulips and a four-tiered cake covered with lattices and 
festooned with sugar-paste irises and lilies. Not impressed? Well, what about a 
cake replica of the White House or decorated gingerbread figures from an 
Austrian Nativity scene? 
</P>
<P>
Once you get past the stage of exclaiming over the spectacles and the 
craftsmanship, you find an educational exhibition that delves into history and 
covers a big chunk of geography. In the illustrated catalogue, for example, you 
find that when the Aztecs greeted Cortez as a god, Montezuma served him "lavish 
banquets at which chocolate flowed freely from golden goblets." After chocolate 
had been transported to Europe and sweetened with sugar, recipes were closely 
guarded. Chocolate was banned in France until Anne of Austria, who married 
Louis XIII, included chocolate secrets in her dowry and made chocolate 
respectable in the French court. 
</P>
<P>
These historical tidbits turn up in a section of the show dealing with 
materials -- sugar and chocolate. Other segments explore tools and techniques, 
shapes and forms, advertising and packaging, confections for special occasions 
and contemporary artists' work that goes "beyond tradition." 
</P>
<P>
The tools include an intriguing variety of wood and metal molds, icing tubes 
and walnut forms for sugar paste flowers. Unfortunately, there's no artist on 
duty to demonstrate how to pull and stretch marbled chocolate into bowls, vases 
and flowers, or to spin long threads of sugar, but you get the idea. As for 
shapes and forms, imagination seems to be the limit. Chocolatiers who know 
their stuff turn out full-size chocolate pliers, wrenches and scissors, as well 
as miniature typewriters, telephones, Bingo boards and Empire State Buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Such labor deserves a sweet sell, and the show offers charming examples in 
illustrated candy wrappers from the '40s and advertising posters from the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the sweetest message of the show is how confectionary traditions 
have grown up around holidays and special occasions throughout the world. Cakes 
are so essential to modern American life that a birthday or wedding celebration 
would be unthinkable without them, but "The Confectioner's Art" offers some new 
ideas. Abraham pastries, filled with marzipan and decorated to resemble the 
bearded patriarch, are presented on 50th birthdays in Holland, so that the 
recipient can feel a little less old and a little more wise. If your 65th 
birthday is coming up, you might consider something like Tom Ambrosina's jazzy 
cake, ringed with multicolor numerals and uplifting slogans: "65 Cheers for 
Senior Citizens" and "Look Alive at 65." 
</P>
<P>
Living up to their reputation, some of the contemporary artists give no thought 
to tradition. They simply rob the candy jar for raw materials, sticking candies 
on furniture, stringing them as beads and using them as tesserae in mosaics. In 
short, they do almost everything with sweets but eat them.

 California Museum of Science and Industry, 700 State Drive, Exposition Park, 
to July 29. Admission is free. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
