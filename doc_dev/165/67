<TEXT>     You do need a general outline of ingredients and techniques. But if you
follow my recipe exactly, all you will end up with is a batch of my brownies.
What you want is a batch of your brownies, ones that speak your name, so to
speak.;    When that happens, you will have achieved the state of brownie
bliss.;    I have known this humbling condition on occasion because I am not
necessarily interested in eating the same identical brownie every time. I
always think my brownies could be a little more chocolaty or buttery or nutty
or chewy.;    So I play, manipulating the variables -- the ingredients, the
temperature, the pan, the baking time -- and seeing how it all turns out.;   
I can be that fearless because of my basic brownie belief: If the batter
tastes good and you don't burn it, then it is very hard to ruin a batch of
brownies, to make something totally inedible.;    The brownie is a mutable
food, acceptable in many forms. It might be real crunchy, which means it is a
"dunker." It might be really gooey in the middle, but if you enjoy eating
batter as much as I do, it's just a brownie with a secret center.;    Needless
to say, this level of theoretical brownie experimentation is not for the
faint-hearted or those who believe that recipes must be followed to the
letter. What folks like that should realize is that the person who made the
first batch of brownies was probably trying to make cookies or cake and it
just didn't work out.;    What follows here is my much-modified maximum
brownie recipe. It resulted from my strenuous and unsuccessful efforts to
create a highly aromatic brownie that was simultaneously crunchy, chewy and
gooey. Ultimately, I hope to understand the brownie on a molecular level.;
JOHN'S MAXIMUM BROWNIES;  1/4 cup chopped, slivered, toasted almonds;  1/3 cup
butter, softened;  3/4 cup white sugar;  2 large eggs;  2 tablespoons light
corn syrup;  1 tablespoon amaretto (almond) or Frangelico (hazelnut) liqueur,
optional;  1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract;  1 cup all-purpose flour;  1/3
cup unsweetened cocoa;  1/8 teaspoon salt;  1/4 teaspoon baking powder;  1/4
cup chopped walnuts;  1/3 cup dark chocolate chips;   Heat oven to 350
degrees. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with foil. Grease and flour. Spread
almonds on a cookie sheet and toast in oven until golden brown and set aside.;
   In a mixing bowl, beat butter, sugar, eggs, corn syrup, liqueur and vanilla
extract until blended. Add flour, cocoa, salt and baking powder; blend until
combined. Sprinkle walnuts into prepared pan, pour in batter, and sprinkle
batter with chocolate chips and almonds. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes or until
brownies begin to pull away from sides of pan. Cool completely. Can be topped
with thick chocolate or vanilla icing. Cut into 16 squares.;    Variations: To
make Nutty Brownies, add a layer of Reese's Peanut Butter cups between layers
of brownie batter. To make Berry Nice Brownies, add 1/2 cup frozen raspberries
or cherries to the batter. To make Black &amp; White Brownies, replace chocolate
chips with white chocolate. To make Mocha Brownies, replace half the cocoa
with instant espresso.;    Serving suggestion: Save energy by serving brownie
batter as "Brownie Dip" with vanilla wafers on the side for easy dipping. It
will be the hit of your next party.  </TEXT>
