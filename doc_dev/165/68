   With the holiday season gearing up, a
chocolate supplier is urging the federal government to avoid a
chocolate shortage by temporarily lifting the import quota for
non-fat dry milk.
   But the chocolate industry is running into opposition from dairy
farmers, who contend that lifting the quota would cause domestic
milk prices to plummet.
   Peter Van Leer, whose 40-year-old family business in Jersey
City, N.J., produces more than 30 million pounds of dark and milk
chocolate each year, said the import limit for non-fat dry milk is
7,000 pounds a year.
   ``That's what we use in a day,'' said Van Leer, whose company
supplies chocolate to Pepperidge Farm cookies, Godiva chocolates
and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream.
   Dry milk also is used in the production of dairy products like
ice creams and cottage cheese.
   Van Leer and another major chocolate supplier, M&amp;M Mars of
Hackettstown, N.J., have seen the price of non-fat dry milk
skyrocket from about 85 cents a pound to as much as $2.50 a pound
in October during a period of fall shortages. Prices have dipped
closer to $2 more recently.
   On Nov. 6, New Jersey's two U.S. seators and nine of its House
members appealed to Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to
suspend the quota and keep chocolate treats on the shelf this
season.
   ``The fall is the busiest season for the chocolate manufacturing
industry as it works to meet increased demand for holiday baking
and gift-giving,'' the lawmakers wrote. ``Without non-fat dry milk,
the availability of a wide variety of chocolate-based goods to the
consumer will be restricted.''
   As of Wednesday, the USDA had provided no detailed response to
the letter, said a spokesman for Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
whose office drafted the letter.
   Dairy farmers oppose any easing of restrictions, saying non-fat
dry milk supplies have loosened in the last few weeks so that
consumers will not face Christmas without their favorite chocolate
desserts.
   ``We have sympathy with the chocolate industry,'' said Mike
Brown, an economist with the National Milk Producers' Federation.
``We want people who use milk to make a living. But we don't want
the government to do silly things that are going to hurt the
industry.''
   Van Leer said this year's dry milk shortage has forced him to
supply some of his chocolate at a loss because much of his
chocolate sells at prices agreed upon months before shipping.
   ``We're hurt this season, but we're delivering on our
commitments,'' said Van Leer, who has not yet tallied his loss. ``I
haven't had the heart to measure it.''
   Both the dairy farmers and chocolate producers agreed that
something must be done year-round to stop American chocolate buyers
from bypassing milk and sugar import restrictions by purchasing
bulk chocolate from European producers.
   ``We're losing market share,'' Van Leer said. ``The real
solution is to make those chocolates subject to the quotas for
sugar and milk.''
