<LEADPARA>  IN THE past few weeks, Dreyer's has introduced 19 new frozen desserts in four
categories. I couldn't taste them all, but here are my notes on some of them.;
   Nonfat Frozen Yogurt Inspirations is a completely new line and an
impressive alternative to ice cream, with only 70 calories for a three-ounce
portion. The mixed berry in particular has a lively berry flavor that really
jumps out at you, with bits of raspberry, blueberry and blackberry. Cherry is
creamy with a clean cherry taste. And vanilla (80 calories) has a nice, subtle
vanilla flavor and lush texture. Other flavors include chocolate, mocha,
strawberry and raspberry.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Moving up the fat ladder, low-fat Frozen Yogurt Inspirations are 96-percent
fat-free. Heath Bar is so delicious I had to check the nutrition label twice.
Yes, only 100 calories for a 3.5 ounce serving. It's incredibly rich and just
sweet enough with crunchy caramel candy bar nubbins strewn throughout.
Boysenberry has a pronounced berry flavor, a creamy texture and no artificial
aftertaste whatsoever. Mocha Fudge has more fudge than mocha, but the fudgy
chocolate is so rich and genuine, who cares? The other new low-fat yogurt
flavor is chocolate sundae (chocolate with marshmallow creme swirls).;   
Among the premium ice creams, Dreyer's peanut butter cup is a real winner, a
wonderful balance of fudge and peanut butter cascading through rich vanilla.
Just in time for summer campfires comes S'Mores, an ingenious blend of
chocolate, nuggets of chocolate-covered grahams and marshmallows. Not bad,
though the marshmallows sort of get lost.;    White Summit combines chocolate
ice cream with bits of Nestle's Alpine white chocolate. A good idea in theory,
but the delicate white chocolate is overwhelmed. Likewise in the limited
edition (available only through June) Chocolate Fudge Sundae; walnuts
overpower the chocolate.;    Strawberry Revelations is a pleasant vanilla ice
cream with ribbons of strawberry syrup through it. The syrup is good (Dreyer's
uses Smuckers), but I didn't get the sensation of fresh berries. You'd do just
as well with the Grand Light version, and save some calories, since this line
is 93 percent fat-free and has only 100 calories and four grams of fat in a
four-ounce portion.;    S'Mores also comes in a Grand Light version along with
chocolate almond fudge and fudgescotch swirl.;    Dreyer's frozen desserts are
available at Lucky's, Nob Hill, and Petrini's stores. Prices range from about
$4.29 to $4.89 for a half gallon.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; On Oct. 11, Dreyer's
will conduct its fifth annual contest for "Assistant Ice Cream Tasters." Five
children (under 12) and 20 adults from around the country will be selected for
a one-day tasting binge at a Dreyer's ice cream factory. The results of the
winners' tasting will help to determine the company's new flavors for 1992. If
you'd like to participate, submit an essay of 150 words or less on why you
would make a "grand" ice cream taster. Send entries to: Assistant Ice Cream
Taster, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, 5929 College Ave., Oakland 94618. Entries
must be received by Aug. 16 and will be judged on creativity.  </TEXT>
