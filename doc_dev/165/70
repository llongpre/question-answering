When it comes to food fantasies, nobody knows more than a good caterer. 
Fantasy, after all, is what the business is about. We asked local caterers to 
tell us their favorite fantasies. Here are their replies: 
</P>
<P>
Picture a flying carpet, a fake camel, big brass urns and tall palms. Add a 
bustling marketplace complete with vendors carrying food baskets and belly 
dancers roaming about. "We took over a client's tennis court and turned it into 
a Moroccan scene," says Cathee Hickok, event coordinator for Rococo Custom 
Catering Service, Van Nuys. "It was a surprise birthday party for the husband 
whose birthday was six months away. He couldn't speak for about an hour after 
he entered the scene." 
</P>
<P>
The whole place was decorated in shimmering tones of burgundy and blue. Guests, 
dressed to match the theme, sat on crushed velvet pillows with tassels eating 
their food from low brass tables. The Moroccan menu featured bastilla, dried 
fruits and lamb on skewers. 
</P>
<P>
But Hickok is now thinking about another booking -- still a year away. It will 
be a Murphy's law party with everything designed to go wrong. On Hickok's 
agenda: "an incorrectly set table, staged fighting guests, chipped china . . ."

Debra Stevenson, of Los Angeles Party Designs, is so fond of all-white parties 
that she has done them both indoors and out. For a lawn party she used yards 
and yards of white tulle, giant white Casablanca lilies, full-blown white roses 
and big white orchids. Her indoor white night was a glittery white Christmas 
affair. The chairs were draped in white, the tables were covered with mirrors, 
and white satin was loosely draped from ceilings to wall. The sole note of 
color: metallic touches of gold confetti, ribbons and tiny gold gift boxes, 
strewn on each table. The food was all-white as well, from cream soup to white 
chocolate cake. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson says that lighting is crucial for this sort of party. "Do it in soft 
pink otherwise everyone will look pale, especially in photographs."

Don Ernstein of Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Foods in Culver City came up with 
an all-copper party, an incredible dessert feast -- and a party he created for 
a woman who is passionate about roses. He sent invitations in heart-shaped 
boxes covered with stickers of old Victorian roses and filled with a potpourri 
of dried rose petals. The house was filled with roses, rose chintz tablecloths 
and tree roses. For dessert: floating island made of meringue floating in rose 
petals with a rose-flavored creme anglaise.

John Lavine of the Wonderful World of Fantasy, Los Angeles, calls himself the 
"dream merchant." He has transformed a home into King Tut's tomb (complete with 
a live black panther), served lox aboard a blimp, and recreated a '40s casino 
at the Spruce Goose. His most recent exploit was taking the crew of "Cheers" 
back to the 1890s at the Gene Autry Museum. 
</P>
<P>
But his most popular theme is the jail party. He recreates a Tijuana prison, 
complete with federales and fighting bandits. The food is Mexican. "Brought in 
by prison buses, people walk in and get shocked out of their minds," he says, 
"when they leave, they're talking to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
And people pay for this? 
</P>

Five years ago Julie and Michael Loshin of Parties Plus created a pre-Castro 
Havana nightclub for a client's 50th birthday. He liked it so well that last 
year he asked them to do another fantasy night. "We were bound and determined 
to blow him away with an authentic Brazilian celebration," they say. 
</P>
<P>
They brought in green bananas on the stalk from South America, they hollowed 
out gourds, fruits and squashes to use as food containers and built barbecues 
out of river rock. The food featured an amazing array of whole fresh fish and 
shrimp, black bean cakes cooked to order and marinated legs of pork. Desserts 
included everything from passion fruit cheesecake to a waterfall of fresh 
tropical fruits. And they served it all in a tent draped in yards of yellow, 
orange and hot pink satin filled with swaying tropical plants, palm trees and 
birds of paradise lit with vivid fluorescent colors.

John Steimetz, director of catering, Westin Bonaventure (and president of the 
National Assn. of Catering Executives) recently recreated a casino for a 
benefit dinner. "We created a set that made you feel like you were walking down 
Bourbon Street," Steimetz says. "We served mini muffaletas, crawfish, stuffed 
deviled clams, Creole sausages, Cajun popcorn, shrimp gumbo, catfish fingers, 
duck and shrimp jambalaya, blackened tenderloin with chile salsa, lots of fresh 
oysters and other seafoods."

Next month, Steinmetz is planning a contest for party planners: each will have 
20 minutes to come up with a fantasy party theme complete with menus. "The 
whole idea is to see how good we can come out with possible future themes," he 
says.

 Don Ernstein of Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Foods likes to serve this 
chocolate loaf with hazelnuts and orange-liqueur for his dessert parties. The 
flavor will depend on the the type of chocolate and butter cookies used. 
"Pepperidge Farm Chessman cookies are excellent for this recipe, which was 
inspired by Judith Olney, a most creative cook," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT TERRINE 
</P>
<P>
1 cup hazelnuts 
</P>
<P>
9 ounces semisweet chocolate, cut up 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder 
</P>

</P>
<P>
11 ounces butter cookies, broken into 1/2-inch bits 
</P>
<P>
Toast hazelnuts in 350-degree oven until they begin to color. Remove and wrap 
in towel. Rub vigorously to remove as much skin as possible. Melt chocolate in 
microwave oven or in double boiler. Combine sugar and water in saucepan over 
low heat. Stir until sugar is melted and mixture is clear. 
</P>
<P>
Beat cocoa and softened butter in bowl until perfectly smooth. Stir in sugar 
syrup, melted chocolate and Grand Marnier. Add egg and egg yolks and mix well. 
Fold in raisins, hazelnuts and cookies. Line 6-cup loaf pan with 2 layers 
plastic wrap, allowing paper to extend beyond ends. Press mixture into prepared 
pan and refrigerate several hours or until set. 
</P>
<P>
To serve unmold by pulling plastic up and out. Invert loaf and lightly sieve 
cocoa powder over top. Cut into thin slices. Makes 12 to 15 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes may be 
used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute 
package for applications.
