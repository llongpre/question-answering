"Basically, people throw themselves into the holidays, using it as a license to 
overeat," says Evelyn Tribole, a registered dietitian. "The meals get bigger 
and fattier, and there are holiday goodies everywhere -- at the office in desk 
drawers or on table tops at home. People figure that come January they will go 
on their famous annual diet. That is not a good idea because it usually doesn't 
work, and there is an easier way to do it."

Since the typical holiday menu can contain as many as 2,000 calories and half 
of those can come from fat, eating half as much is a reasonable goal. On a 
1,000-calorie plan, you're allowed 33 grams of fat.

This is the requirement we asked the chefs to follow in developing a lighter 
holiday menu: Each of the following ingredients is equal to 1 teaspoon of fat; 
the chefs were allowed 6 to 7 teaspoons of fat per person. Outside of these 
restrictions, the chefs were free to select any items they desired.
