   Please don't eat the art exhibit.
   Museum-goers may feel like kids in a candy store when viewing an
exhibit on the history of using sugar, chocolate and other sweets to
create works of art.
   Highlights of the show at the California Museum of Science and
Industry are a jelly-bean rendition of the Statue of Liberty, a
house of chocolate chip cookies and a chocolate bust of Albert
Einstein.
   On display are ``more than 200 culinary masterpieces,'' curators
said.
   ``It's not a superscientific exhibit, but it's kind of frothy for
summer,'' museum spokeswoman Sue Glad said.
   ``The Confectioner's Art'' exhibit opened Monday for an
eight-week run.
