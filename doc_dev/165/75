</P>

There are enough cake recipes in this collection to enjoy before, during and 
after the holidays. Each of the cakes includes coconut, but there the 
similarity ends. 
</P>
<P>
Prize Coconut Cake incorporates the coconut into the batter, as well as using 
it for the crowning touch. Lemon Butter Cream Frosting, a basic frosting with 
grated lemon peel and juice, adds a just-right tartness to complement the cake. 
</P>
<P>
Chopped sweet cooking chocolate, coconut and raisins add moistness and texture 
to Chocolate-Coconut Pound Cake. A Sweet Chocolate Glaze further emphasizes the 
rich, chocolate goodness of the cake. 
</P>
<P>
After baking and cooling Pina Colada Cake, a warm glaze of crushed pineapple 
and rum is spooned over before the coconut-and-orange section garnish is added. 
Coconut Chiffon Cake, baked in a springform or layer pan, may be served plain 
or with a coconut garnish.
