<LEADPARA>  AS MUCH AS I really hate to admit it, I am a confirmed 'chocoholic.' I get
ecstatic as Valentine's Day approaches because I know my husband, John, will
indulge me with a "surprise" box of chocolates. Since I love to make
Valentine's Day last as long as possible, I make the chocolate last by
savoring one or two pieces each night until the box is finished. I am what you
might call a "disciplined" chocoholic.;    Unfortunately, if I don't hide the
chocolate box in some ridiculous place, I may never get to eat more than a few
pieces. You see, I married an "undisciplined" chocoholic. Everyone has at
least one in their family.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The only thing that really bothers me after eight years of marriage is that
I'm running out of hiding places.;    This year I've decided to outsmart him.
I am going to entrance John with the promise of his own small boxes of
chocolate truffles made by "yours truly." The only catch is he has to find
them. For some reason, he only enjoys his chocolate if it takes some effort
for him to find it. I am beginning to think he has some psychological hang up
because he never found enough candy during Easter egg hunts as a child.;    I
hope he will be so busy finding and eating my tenderly made morsels that I
will be able to relish mine in peace. I'm probably dreaming chocoholic dreams,
but it's worth a try.;    Why not surprise your valentine with my favorite
chocolate truffle recipe. It needs no stove-top cooking, is made with a
microwave and food processor, and can be flavored with any liquor that suits
your fancy. The basis of any good truffle recipe is a good ganache. Said to
have originated in Switzerland as the basis for truffles, chocolate ganache
also makes a delectable cake filling or frosting. Make sure you prepare it
when "undisciplined" chocoholics aren't lurking in the shadows. If they get a
taste, the recipe will never make it to Valentine's Day.;     DARK CHOCOLATE
TRUFFLES;   Yield: 2 3/4 cups of thick chocolate ganache, enough for 2 dozen
truffles, or, to fill and frost two 8-by-1 1/2-inch round cake layers, or two
9-inch cake layers.;  4 (3 oz.) bars imported bittersweet chocolate;  2
tablespoons butter at room temperature;  1 2/3 cups heavy cream;  2 Tbsps. of
your favorite liquor, (optional);  In a food processor work bowl fitted with
metal chopping blade, break chocolate into small pieces. Process until the
chocolate is very fine. Stop the machine and add the butter. Process a few
seconds until butter is incorporated. Heat the cream to the boiling point in
your microwave. With the food processor motor running, pour the hot cream
through the feed tube of your food processor. Process a few seconds until
smooth. While the machine is running, pour the liquor through the feed tube
and process a few seconds. Transfer the chocolate to a bowl. Fit the bowl with
plastic wrap so the wrap is sitting directly on the surface of the chocolate
and up the sides of the bowl to create a seal and to prevent a skin from
forming on the top of the chocolate as it cools. Let stand at room temperature
for several hours until completely cooled and thickened. At this point the
ganache will be of a spreadable consistency perfect for cakes. For truffles,
put the ganache in the refrigerator to thicken and cool for several more
hours. To speed the cooling process, you can put the ganache in the freezer,
but you must check it to make sure it doesn't become too hard to scoop out
with a teaspoon.;     MAKING THE TRUFFLES;  cocoa;  finely chopped nuts;  When
ganache is of a consistency that can be molded with the hands, use a teaspoon
to scoop out enough for a 1-inch diameter candy. With completely dry hands,
quickly roll the candy into a ball and immediately roll in cocoa or finely
chopped nuts. Set aside on a large plate covered with waxed paper. After you
have formed several candies and placed them on the plate, transfer the plate
to the refrigerator so the candies can harden. Continue to make truffles,
transferring them to the refrigerator plate. When you are finished, wait at
least one hour until the whole batch has hardened in the refrigerator before
you package the truffles.;    To prepare for gift giving: Place each truffle
in a fluted candy paper and arrange in a gift box or decorated candy tin. To
separate layers in a deep gift box, cut waxed paper to fit the box and place
it on top of each layer. Keep the gift-boxed truffles in the refrigerator
until you are ready to present them as a gift. Truffles should be kept
refrigerated by the recipient.  </TEXT>
