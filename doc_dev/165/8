<LEADPARA>  IT'S 2 p.m. The soup on the cafeteria steam table is crusted over and the
salad bar looks as if it's been sitting in the sun too long. What's quick,
nutritious and good tasting for lunch?;    Fantastic Foods of Novato has six
new dehydrated meals-in-a-cup:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (box) Splittin' Peas is so rich and creamy it's hard to believe it has no
meat stock or dairy products and no fat -- technically, it has less than one
gram, which qualifies as "fat-free." A 10-ounce serving (when water is added)
has only 165 calories.;    (box) All-O-Round Spaghetti features whole-wheat
noodle rings in what is described as a, "zesty tomato sauce." I'd amend that
to say, "reasonably satisfying." This one has 211 calories and two grams of
fat.;    (box) Whole-Wheat Alphabet Soup has a delicious miso broth with a
slight oniony undertone. It has 150 calories and less than one gram of fat.;  
 (box) Leapin' Lentils Over Couscous (all the containers are decorated with
some variation on dancing vegetables) is a hearty number with loads of fiber
and a pleasant tomato flavor. This fat-free meal has 180 calories.;    (box)
The only disappointment was Cha-Cha Chili (208 calories, 2 grams of fat) which
was dull and pasty.;    (box) Jumpin' Black Beans is a fat-free soup that I
didn't try.;    All these lunch alternatives cost about $1.39 and are
available at stores such as Bread of Life in Campbell, Whole Foods Market in
Palo Alto and Bumble Bee Health Foods in Mountain View.;    (hbox);    If you
want to splurge a little -- in calories and price -- I suggest one of three
new individual quiches from Nancy's Specialty Foods. The Southwestern has an
unmistakable regional flavor, courtesy mostly of green chilies and
fire-roasted peppers. Spring Vegetable is a mild blend of several vegetables
with three cheeses, Cheddar, mozzarella and Parmesan. My favorite is the
Italian, with robust roasted pepper, vegetable and cheese flavors.;    These
quiches, and three others I tasted several months ago, are well-made with
tender crusts and all-natural ingredients. They cook up in a jiffy in the
microwave oven and smell terrific while they do. They cost from $1.99 to $2.50
and are available in the supermarket frozen food section.;    (hbox);    For
dessert, or maybe with that afternoon coffee, try three new biscotti from Cafe
Brio in Redwood City. Though they are not classical in shape and taste more
like cookies than biscotti, they're still worth trying. Almond Spice has a
subtle gingersnap flavor. Chocolate Chip Espresso tastes like a very good
chocolate-chip cookie. Double Chocolate is for those who can't get enough
chocolate from chocolate chips alone. All the biscotti have a good crunch
factor -- hard enough to hold up under dunking but not so hard that they
loosen bridgework. An eight-ounce bag costs about $5 and is available at Whole
Foods Market and Cafe Verona in Palo Alto; Penguin's Place Frozen Yogurt in
the Vallco Fashion Park; and Draeger's in Los Altos.  </TEXT>
