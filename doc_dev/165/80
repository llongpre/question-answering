DEAR SOS: With the great Latino influence in our cooking, I'm sure many of your 
readers would really love to get their hands on a recipe for the chocolate cake 
I had at Tamayo's restaurant in Los Angeles. I do know that it was made with 
Ibarra, a Mexican chocolate. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
 -- ROSE

<P>
DEAR ROSE: Delighted. And so was Tamayo's executive chef, David Barber, who 
graciously provided the recipe. Yes, the recipe does use Ibarra chocolate, 
which can be found at any Mexican grocery store or in the Mexican food sections 
of supermarkets.

DEAR SOS: I really would like the recipe for the Creole gumbo I had at the 
Fairmont Hotel in New Orleans. It was once printed in your newspaper and I 
would love to see the recipe again.

DEAR JEAN: So would many of our readers, we think, because it's a perfect main 
dish for family or friends during this time of year. File powder, from the 
leaves of the sassafras tree, is a thickening and flavoring agent that often 
replaces or enhances the flavor and texture produced by okra. It is widely 
available at most supermarkets these days.
