<LEADPARA>  Caffe Verona is a hard place to pigeonhole, but don't let that put you off. In
local terms, it partakes of characteristics of Il Fornaio and The Prolific
Oven, with trendy, modern-classical interpretations of Italian and other
Mediterranean dishes, yet with an informal, order-from-the-counter feel to it
that is well in keeping with its characterization as a caffe rather than a
ristorante. The service is prompt, attentive, and friendly, combining the
informality of a coffee house with the watchfulness of a four-star staff.;   
One nice touch: All of the day's dishes are on display in a glass case at the
rear of the cafe. Since you order from the counter that tops this glass case,
this visual "menu" (complete with hand-lettered price and description cards)
makes a wonderful way to decide. There's also a chalkboard behind the case,
but I've seen a few things in the case that I couldn't find on the chalkboard,
so keep your eyes open.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Once you order, take a seat either inside or on the recessed doorway just
off the busy sidewalk of Hamilton Street near Ramona and the staff will bring
your food after a very short wait.;    But what can you order? The contents of
Caffe Verona's glass case are mainly pasta dishes, with salads, sandwiches and
a few other simple treats thrown in for variety. The pasta selections range
from $6.50 to $7.25, with spaghetti in tomato sauce at the low end of the
spectrum and rigatoni with sausage and peppers topping the list. The panini
are cute little sandwiches made on tiny football-shaped loaves of crusty
Italian bread, and range from $4.80 for a sandwich made with your choice of
cheese to $4.95 for one made with prosciutto and mozzarella fresca.;    I
almost ordered the Greek appetizer plate ($6.50); this contains an appealing
assortment of cold delicacies, including two large slabs of feta cheese,
tender purple kalamata olives, marinated artichoke hearts, marinated
peperoncine and fresh spinach leaves all slathered with oregano. There are
other cold plates, ranging from $5.50 for a cheese plate to $6.50 for one with
prosciutto or a selection of plates.;    But the pasta dishes grab your eyes,
so I first went for the penne in spinach and ricotta cheese ($6.25). I love
the texture of penne, the bias-cut tubes of pasta, though they're at their
best in a sauce that can fill hollow tubes nicely. But there's little to
complain about here. The sauce is pleasantly deceiving, as it looks almost
exactly like pesto: minced green leaves mixed up with a little bright olive
oil and some cheese for body. But the earthy vegetal freshness of spinach is a
startling change from the licorice aroma of basil, and the smooth sweetness of
ricotta forms an excellent backdrop for the minced fresh spinach. There's just
barely enough oil in the dish, which is nice; it could be easily spoiled by
too heavy a hand with the extra-virgin olive oil, and instead comes across as
a nicely balanced dish.;    I liked the experience so much I went back a few
days later for another lunch, and once again the pasta lured me, this time the
cheese ravioli ($7.25). The ravioli is obviously fresh and of first-rate
quality, mild ricotta cheese inside firm semolina pasta. The sauce is
excellent, light and fresh, made from diced onions and chunks of fresh
tomatoes with the skins removed, cooked just to the point where they soften
and turn a brilliant orange rather than the pink of raw tomatoes. It's light,
refreshing and satisfying. But I can't help thinking that $7.25 is a pretty
steep price for cheese ravioli, as good as these are, especially given the a
la carte nature of the place.;    Desserts, now, brook no complaint. If
there's anything I like better than chocolate and hazelnuts, it's almonds and
raspberries, and so far the two desserts I've tried here have included these
respective combinations. The chocolate hazelnut torte ($2.95) slathers a rich
chocolate buttercream filling between a layer of white genoise cake with
hazelnuts and a dark chocolate sponge cake, then tops the whole thing with
more buttercream. It's intense yet fairly delicate, a little too sweet if
you're accustomed to the Italian taste in gianduia (chocolate-hazelnut
praline) but it's well within the American palate's minimum daily requirement
of sugar.;    But the chocolate hazelnut torte pales in comparison to the
almond-raspberry tarte ($1.95) . This dish, as simple as it seems, does a much
better job of conveying the Italian sense of counterpoint in desserts, mixing
the unctuous sweetness of almond paste in a thick, moist cake with the
pungency of a fresh raspberry coulis topping. The raspberry topping is very
tangy, the way fresh raspberries are, with that musky fruitiness under the
ascorbic acid, and it serves to cleanse the palate from the otherwise-cloying,
almost marzipan base. It's a marvelous example of how to exceed without
excess, how to take one's palate to the limits and balance it for sheer
enjoyment.;    Caffe Verona also has a decent selection of wines by the glass
(although they suffer the same fate as the cheese ravioli, the heartbreak of
high markup) and an espresso bar that is above reproach. For a double
espresso, $1.50 isn't bad by local standards, particularly when it's of such
high quality, and the caffe moca (steamed chocolate milk in a large espresso,
topped with a spoonful of heavy whipped cream) is a perfect way to start or
end the day. And since Caffe Verona has such reasonable hours, I just might do
both someday soon.; Caffe Verona; Where: 236 Hamilton Ave., Palo Alto; (415)
