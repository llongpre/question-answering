<LEADPARA>  YOU DON'T have to be a professional cake decorator to produce beautiful

<TEXT>     (check) Chocolate curls are an elegant decorating tool. To make them, slice
across a square of chocolate with a sharp vegetable peeler. Depending on the
type of cake you are decorating, you can use a square of dark, milk or white
chocolate.;    (check) To add interest to ivory-colored cream cheese frosting
typically used on carrot cake, sprinkle with grated carrot or score the cake
into serving pieces and garnish each piece with two pecan halves and a
pineapple tidbit.;    (check) If you don't want to frost a cake but still
would like visual interest, try decorating the top's outer edge with dollops
of whipped cream, placing a piece of fruit in the middle of each dollop.
Choose colorful fruit, such as drained mandarin orange slices, slices of
strawberry, whole small berries. Without the fruit, a dusting of cinnamon or
nutmeg will add a special touch to the cream dollops.;    (check) Thin slices
of orange or lemon can be used for decoration. With peel intact, thinly slice
fruit. Make one cut halfway through each slice and twist the slice into an "S"
shape. These can be placed on top of the cake or around the bottom of a bundt
cake. A sprig of mint in the middle of each slice adds a nice touch.;   
(check) Give whole strawberries four or five lengthwise slices to just below
the cap, then fan out for a pretty garnish. Peach slices can be used to form a
pinwheel shape. Maraschino cherries add a bright touch of red, or for green
try slices or chunks of kiwi fruit.;    (check) Many restaurants have begun
serving sauce under items instead of poured over them and this can be done
with desserts, as well. For example, a pretty dessert can be created by
pouring sweetened raspberry puree into a serving plate, placing a slice of
chocolate cake with white icing in the middle of the puree, then garnishing
with a few whole raspberries.;    (check) Dress up a cake by creating extra
layers. By creating four layers from a cake made in two round cake pans, you
can add extra frosting or experiment with different fillings, such as those
using pudding or whipped cream. Spread the fillings between the layers but not
around the outside so the layers are visible.;    To slice layers in half
evenly, mark the layer's midpoint with toothpicks around the sides of the
cake. Then cut in half using the toothpicks as a cutting guide.;    (check)
Candy pieces can add flavor, color and crunch to dessert toppings.
Multicolored candy sprinkles, jelly beans and candy-coated chocolate, nuts or
peanut-butter candies are good choices.;    (check) For decorating, make your
own decorator's tube by cutting off one corner from a small zip-lock plastic
bag. Fill the bag with about 1/3 cup of frosting, melted chocolate or fruit
puree and seal the top. Use to drizzle frosting onto cake in decorative
patterns.  </TEXT>
