DEAR SOS: Would it be possible to get the recipe for the garlic-cheese toast 
served at the Covina Bowl Coffee Shop in Covina? I'm not able to bowl anymore 
and would like to make the bread at home.

DEAR MILDRED: It's a strike, all right. The cheese toast would be great to 
serve with Easter dinner or soup and salad suppers later on.
