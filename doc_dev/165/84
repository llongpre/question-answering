Just about every year at this time, nostalgia over foods eaten in school 
cafeterias years ago rears a maudlin head. 
</P>
<P>
How good or bad those school day foods actually were matters not. It's how well 
remembered, adored and revered they are today that counts. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Gilges of Long Beach writes: "In the cafeteria in the early '60s, they 
used to make a tuna sandwich and a killer peanut butter cookie. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Vakovich remembers a crumb cake sold during nutrition break. "It's been a 
very long time since I've eaten that great cake," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
So we're back digging in our files for those long-lost recipes for cookies, 
pizzas, cinnamon rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Experience throughout the years has told us that sweets are remembered most 
fondly and most frequently. Ranger Cookies (also known as Flying Saucers), the 
most frequently requested school recipe, was formulated for home use by a 
cereal manufacturer in 1952, according to school officials interviewed some 
years ago. Back then the Los Angeles City Unified School District food service 
director was Helen Crane, who adapted the recipe that has been a favorite 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Today, an oversized chocolate chip cookie and a plain, moist and dense crumb 
cake, the standard breakfast item today, are considered the most popular sweets 
on the a la carte menu, according to Anita King, now head of nutrition services 
for the Los Angeles City Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Today, too, attitudes toward sweets have dramatically altered school menus, 
particularly the dessert menu. 
</P>
<P>
School district nutritionists have markedly curbed dessert offerings in the 
School Lunch Program in an effort to conform to the U.S. Dietary Guidelines to 
reduce fats and sugars in the diet. Today, school lunch rooms are serving 
occasional cookies such as apple-oatmeal, ice milk and fruit juice bars along 
with fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten away from serving desserts almost entirely in the last seven or 
eight years. We try to encourage fresh fruit for school lunches," said King. 
</P>
<P>
Sugary goodies, however, have been available on an a la carte basis all along. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Devil's Food Cake, which was introduced in 1939 to the Los 
Angeles City Schools by Frances Johnson, when she was a manager at one of the 
schools. Today, the recipe for the dark, moist cake derives its red coloring 
from baking soda, not the red food dye used in the past. "The cake is 
especially good when frosted with Seven Minute Frosting, and dribbled with 
melted chocolate," suggested King. And there are readers who have reminded us 
how wonderful that gooey cake was -- and is. 
</P>
<P>
Sour Cream Coffeecake, a version of the breakfast coffee crumb cake requested 
by Vakovich, has been part of the school cafeteria repertoire since 1959 and is 
still served at special school functions. 
</P>
<P>
A peanut crunch, still requested by readers, was served in the Glendale Unified 
School District for years and was one of the all-time favorites of that school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Among the favorite entrees most requested throughout the years has been pizza, 
which made its debut in 1957 in the Long Beach Unified School District. Today, 
according to King, pizza is numero uno, along with tacos and hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, however, when the best-remembered entrees were such school 
favorites as chopped beef and gravy over mashed potatoes and roast beef hash, 
no longer served in schools. Readers, however, still request the recipes. And 
we still print them. 
</P>
<P>
Here they are, along with other old and new recipes from school cafeterias that 
will no doubt be passed on through the years to come, like heirlooms:
