<LEADPARA>  Bundled against the cold to keep her sweet tooth from chattering, 15-year-old
Lena Malakhova waited for two hours along with thousands of other Muscovites
Friday for the chance to buy American candy bars.;    Mars Inc., the U.S.
candy maker, put more than 23 tons of Snickers, Milky Way, Mars and Raider
candy bars on sale for rubles for the first time in the Soviet Union -- much
to the delight of self-confessed chocoholics like Lena.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Because of a notice that the candy would go on sale starting Friday at one
site only, hundreds of people gathered at the doors of the huge bread and
confectionery store for its 9 a.m. opening.;    At midday, more than 400
people were lined up along busy Kalinin Prospekt, two doors down from a
theater where the American movie "Gone With the Wind" is playing. And frankly,
many didn't give a damn about the 12-degree temperatures and steady snowfall
as they waited to buy their candy.;    Inside, more than 200 others waited at
several counters decorated with the candy bars stacked in pyramids.;    "We
were waiting for about two hours," Lena said as she and a giggling friend
secured their candy bars and rebuttoned their winter coats. "Probably in the
United States, you don't wait as long.";    Lena, who had not tasted the
chocolate yet, said the candy bars "are very beautiful. . . . I have no words.
We have never seen such candy in the Soviet Union.";    "Excellent quality,"
said 14-year-old Roman Roy, who had just finished a Snickers bar after waiting
2 1/2 hours in line.;    But Lydia Lisovaya, 58, was more critical, as were
other older shoppers who said the American candy bars had too many additives.;
   "It's nothing special. It tastes pleasant," said Lisovaya, chewing a Milky
Way, "but it's much worse than Soviet chocolate.";    "In our view, the
chocolate is best when it's nothing but chocolate of good quality," she said.
"And you use soybeans, yes?";    The problem, all shoppers agreed, is that
Soviet chocolate and other candy is practically impossible to find, primarily
because of the nation's shortage of sugar.;    Foreign-made candy bars have
been sold in the Soviet Union -- but only at special stores for hard currency
only.;    Some of the shoppers complained that the candy bars were not cheap,
at five rubles for four bars -- one of each kind. Five rubles is about
one-third of a day's pay for most Soviet workers.  </TEXT>
