<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  FOR THOSE of you for whom Valentine's Day is a chocolate feast, check out
Cocolat. Recently, I tried a few of Cocolat's confections. I was bowled over
by the "eat-me-up" chocolate heart box. It's milk chocolate wrapped in
burgundy foil with a cute bow. But the kicker is the filling -- bittersweet
chocolate balls filled with the best vanilla caramel you ever tasted. It's
worth the $14.95 price tag.;    Other goodies include milk-chocolate filled
apples ($11.95), chocolate heart pendants ($10.95) and hand-crafted,
truffle-filled red velvet boxes ($25). There are several Cocolat stores in the
Bay Area including one at the Stanford Shopping Center, (415) 328-5548.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Tasting Notes  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     (hbox);    Apple-cinnamon flavors don't usually do much for me, but I liked
the new Quaker Oats apple cinnamon rice cakes. Though sugar-free, there is a
touch of sweetness from something called "natural apple cinnamon flavor." And
at only 40 calories each, these rice cakes make great snacks. A 4.9-ounce
package sells for about $1.79.; (hbox);    Yoplait has introduced pudding made
with yogurt. This is an interesting switch because in the past companies like
Yoplait have taken yogurt, essentially a health food in its pure form, and
mucked it up with sugary preserves. Now they're taking pudding and supposedly
making it more healthful by adding yogurt.;    The vanilla pudding has a
yogurt texture and tastes like yogurt mixed with pudding. It's not as cloying
as some puddings. The chocolate tastes less like yogurt and more like real,
almost scratch, chocolate pudding. A multi-pack of four 4-ounce packs retails
for about $1.89.;    On the other hand, new Yoplait light yogurts are awful.
Sweetened with Nutrasweet, they have only 60 calories per 4-ounce container,
about half of regular Yoplait yogurt. But the blueberry I tasted had only the
faintest blueberry flavor and didn't taste like yogurt at all, which for some
people is a good thing, I suppose. Strawberry-banana was even worse. It
reminded me of the penny candy I used to eat as a kid.; (hbox);    A while
back I slammed Jack-In-The-Box for its feeble attempt at a cheesesteak
sandwich. Now it's time to bestow kudos for its chicken fajita pita -- only
300 calories if you don't load up on the guacamole. The sandwich is made of
grilled chicken, grilled onions, shredded American cheese, tomatoes and leaf
lettuce, all stuffed into a pita pocket. It's available after 10:30 a.m. and
costs $2.69.; (hbox);    If you're wondering where to get that Spam sushi
Joyce Gemperlein mentioned last week, it's available at Bento Xpress, 211
Jackson St., San Jose, and 23 N. Milpitas Blvd., Milpitas. A box of four sushi
and some marinated bean sprouts costs $3. Hey, don't knock it until you've
tried it.  </TEXT>
