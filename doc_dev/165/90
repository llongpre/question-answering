   It's a chocoholic's dream come true _ a
7,000-pound chocolate bar. But, alas, munching won't be allowed.
   The chocolate bar, 25 feet long, 6{ feet wide and better than 7{
inches thick, is coming to this eastern Oklahoma town of 6,100 from
the Nestle factory in Bloomington, Ill.
   Company officials will unveil their giant Nestle's Crunch Bar at
the Wal-Mart Super Center on Friday.
   Greg Epps, the store's food director, said he was looking for a
sizable promotion and Nestle was willing and able to carry it out.
   ``We just came up with something out of the ordinary,'' Epps
said.
   The candy bar, which will be sized up by officials with the
Guinness Book of World Records on Saturday, will be transported in
a special truck, said Linda Gavlick, spokeswoman for Nestle in
Purchase, N.Y.
   The bar will go on tour after its unveiling in Wagoner. Nestle
officials hope to donate the candy bar to first lady Barbara Bush
for a Fourth of July auction, with proceeds contributed to a
charity of her choice.

   The caddy lugging Nancy Lopez's golf bag
might look familiar to baseball fans. He's retired baseball player
Ray Knight, who just happens to be Lopez's husband.
   ``It's something I've always wanted to do. I can be with her out
here and the family more. I've enjoyed it,'' said Knight, 33,
recently retired after an 18-year career, the last 13 in the major
leagues.
   ``I know a lot of people tease him about carrying my bag, but
he's my best friend, not just my husband,'' said Lopez, a Ladies
Professional Golf Association Hall of Famer.
   Knight, the Most Valuable Player of the 1986 World Series when
he was with the New York Mets, said his new job, ``is not as easy
as it looks.''
   ``He knows what he's doing out there,'' said Lopez, who will be
among the favorites in the $450,000 Ai Star-Centinela Hospital
Classic that starts Friday at Rancho Park in Los Angeles.
   ``I've been in baseball 18 years, so I know about competition,
understanding pressures, failures and successes,'' said Knight.
``So I can relate to what Nancy's feeling. I know when to say
something and when not to.''
   And Knight's advice should carry a certain amount of weight _ he
did, after all, beat his wife at golf once, some three years ago.
He shot a par 72 to beat her by one shot.
   ``He got lucky,'' Lopez said.
