   The student newspaper at the University of
Texas at San Antonio was attaching a condom to each copy of today's
paper, which is devoted to education about AIDS.
   The approximately 6,000 condoms have been hand-pasted into
informational brochures to be distributed in the Paisano.
   ``We felt there was a need for AIDS education, what it's doing,
who it's affecting, how it spreads,'' said John P. Eckrem, editor of
the 10-page, biweekly independent paper. ``We wanted to put out
straightforward information.''
   Eckrem said the editorial board decided last November to run an
AIDS issue and to include the condoms to highlight February as
Condom Awareness Month.
   ``It's just a coincidence the issue comes out on Valentine's
Day,'' Eckrem said.
   The condoms were donated by the San Antonio AIDS Foundation.

   Postal workers were running a little short
of their goal but still managed to put this town's special
Valentine's Day cancellation on nearly a quarter of a million
letters.
   ``We even had 10 from the Kremlin,'' said Mabel Thompson, who has
been running the volunteer program with her husband, Ted, since 1947.
   Postmaster Lane Edstrom said workers had put the Loveland mark on
245,000 letters from more than 100 countries by Monday night.
   He speculated that the ailing Colorado economy and the rise in
first-class postage to 25 cents last year has kept volume below the
office's goal of 300,000 love letters. Last year, people sent
275,000 pieces of mail to Loveland for its special Valentine's Day
posting, Edstrom said.
   But Mrs. Thompson thinks the recent wave of winter weather may
have chilled the hearts of lovers.
   ``The storm in the East probably hurt quite a bit, because we
didn't come up with as many from there as we usually do,'' she said.
   The U.S. Postal Service also put out a list of post offices for
Valentine's Day postmarks that included Loving, Texas; Hart, Mich.;
and Valentine in Arizona, Nebraska and Virginia.
   This year's Loveland Valentines were stamped with this poem,
written by the Thompsons:
   ``Dan Cupid's found a rainbow
   He's gathered stardust too
   And now this little Valentine
   Brings loving thoughts of you.''

   It is a small shop filled with romance and
magic where lovers go today for the sweetest of gifts, including
pink and white candy tulips on sculptured chocolate bowls
hand-painted by Joseph Schmidt.
   Joseph Schmidt Confections, a 5-year-old love affair of Schmidt
and partner Audrey Ryan, has delighted Queen Elizabeth II, former
President Reagan and thousands of loyal customers with its artistic
and tasty creations.
   Some of Schmidt's chocolate flowers and shell-like bowls,
favorites on Saint Valentines Day, are on display at a touring show
of confection art by the American Craft Museum in New York.
   ``My goal is to create a dream for clients, to fulfill their
fantasies,'' said Schmidt, expressing the same childlike joy as the
hero of the movie ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.''
   Like Wonka, everything Schmidt makes is satisfying and delicious.
Talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes.
   Schmidt, who said he's ``49 going on 30,'' once made a chocolate
replica of the Eiffel Tower for the French ambassador and a giant
panda holding bamboo shoots for a Wildlife Foundation dinner with
Prince Phillip.
   The two former pastry chefs and a staff of 90 people at their
chocolate factory and retail shop each week turn 40,000 pounds of
premium raw chocolate from Belgium into a variety of treats for the
sweet of tooth.
