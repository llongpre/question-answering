"Thanks a million for the cookies. It means a lot for us to know that back home 
the people care. It was a nice surprise to receive some home cooking. Operation 
Cookie to us deployed servicemen (and women) is a complete success. Keep up the 
good work." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sgt. William Evans, U.S. Air Force 
</P>
<P>
Mail -- letters and packages -- are among the biggest morale boosters to the 
men and women involved in Operation Desert Shield, according to reports from 
the Middle East. Whether it comes from family, friends or even strangers 
doesn't matter; everything is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone willing to bake and package a batch of cookies can take part in 
Operation Cookie, a nationwide grass-roots effort to airlift cookies to the 
troops. The endeavor began when Karen Buker, of Federal Way, Wash., posted a 
request -- on a national computer bulletin board -- for cookie recipes she 
could send her son in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
In response, she not only received recipes but cookies and letters from all 
across the United States. When mailing complications arose, Sylvia Mease, a 
Florida homemaker, arranged for the cookies to be shipped, space available, 
from Patrick Air Force Base. To date more than 500 boxes (weighing between one 
and 25 pounds) of cookies have been sent to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Islamic laws are strict, so recipes should not contain alcohol. Buker also 
suggests including a note or letter. Send cookies to either Operation Cookie, 
c/o Stephen Butler, 4874 Palm Ave., La Mesa, Calif. 92041-3812, or Operation 
Cookie, c/o Sub-Trek 1, 190 Malabar Road, No. 119, Palm Bay West Center, Palm 
Bay, Fla. 32907. 
</P>
<P>
Packages personally addressed to family or friends are sent via the U.S. Postal 
Service to an APO (Army and Air Force) or FPO (Navy and Marine) box in either 
New York or San Francisco. The Army Post Office, Air Post Office or Fleet Post 
Office will handle delivery from those points. Packages may not exceed 70 
pounds or 108 inches total dimension (length and girth combined). 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army National Public Affairs Office recommends sending oatmeal, 
molasses and sugar cookies, as well as brownies. Other suggested items for 
mailing are hard candy, peanut butter, canned fruit and tuna, and unsalted 
pretzels and snacks. Basically, food that melts or contains a lot of salt 
should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
When selecting recipes, keep in mind that it takes 10 days to three weeks for 
delivery. Fruit cakes and moist quick breads will stay fresh longer and travel 
better than yeast breads. Bar cookies are a better choice than thin, or tender 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
The best damage insurance during shipping is a careful job of packing. Begin by 
totally covering the item with plastic wrap, then foil. This is relatively easy 
in the case of cakes and breads. Bar cookies can be wrapped without cutting; 
delicate cookies should be individually wrapped and packed in layers, with 
cushioning between. Some items can be baked in inexpensive aluminum pans; after 
cooling, the same pans will give extra support during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
Place the items in a sturdy corrugated carton that has all the flaps intact so 
it can be securely closed. Since new cartons are not always available, used 
cartons are acceptable if checked for flaws. Be certain to carefully mark out 
all old addresses to eliminate any confusion. The carton needs to be large 
enough to hold the item or items in addition to plenty of cushioning material. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service suggests using polystyrene, excelsior or shredded 
newspaper for cushioning. Popcorn is not recommended because it can absorb 
hazardous fumes from the aircraft and become toxic. 
</P>
<P>
Cushioning should lightly overfill the container before closure. That way even 
after it settles, the item or items will be prevented from moving around during 
shipping. When several items are in the same package, they must be protected 
from each other too. 
</P>
<P>
Sturdy tape should be used to close the carton. Pressure-sensitive, 
filament-reinforced tape or reinforced paper tape 2 inches to 3 inches wide is 
recommended by the Post Office. Masking tape is not acceptable because it has a 
paper base and breaks easily. For extra strength, start the tape on the side of 
the carton adjacent to the closure. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly print the address directly on the box or a firmly affixed label. Use a 
felt tip marker or ball point pen to prevent smudging if it gets wet. Include 
the full address, including ZIP Code. 
</P>
<P>
String or twine should not be used on the outside of packages. This can get 
caught in machinery used in transporting packages to destinations.

 This recipe from "City Cuisine" (William Morrow &amp; Co., 1989: $19.95) by 
Sue Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken is a particularly good version of an old 
favorite.

OLD-FASHIONED PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES 
</P>
<P>
1 cup unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
1 cup granulated sugar 
</P>

1 cup brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
2 cups soft peanut butter, smooth or crunchy 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs 
</P>

1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Flour 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
Cream together butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar. Stir in peanut butter 
until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla. Mix until well combined. 
</P>
<P>
Combine 3 cups flour, salt and baking soda. Add to peanut butter mixture, 
stirring just until flour disappears. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon about 1 tablespoon batter each for small cookies or 3 tablespoons each 
for jumbos on lightly buttered and floured or parchment-lined baking sheets. 
Dip tines of fork into flour and score each cookie in traditional crisscross 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 350 degrees 15 minutes for small cookies, 20 minutes for jumbos. Edges 
should just begin to turn golden. Remove from baking sheets and cool on wire 
racks. Makes 50 small or 18 jumbo cookies.

 The following very decadent brownie recipe comes from "Maida Heatter's Book of 
Great Chocolate Desserts" (Alfred A. Knopf: 1980). The author describes them as 
"the biggest, thickest, gooiest, chewiest, darkest, sweetest, 
mostest-of-the-most chocolate bars." 
</P>
<P>
PALM BEACH BROWNIES 
</P>
<P>
Softened butter 
</P>
<P>
8 ounces unsweetened chocolate 
</P>
<P>
1 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
5 eggs 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon almond extract 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 tablespoons dry instant espresso or other powdered (not granular) instant 
coffee 
</P>
<P>
3 3/4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 2/3 cups sifted flour 
</P>
<P>
8 ounces walnut halves or large pieces 
</P>
<P>
Invert 13x9-inch metal baking pan. Cover with foil, pressing down around sides 
and corners to shape foil like pan. Remove foil. Turn pan right side up and 
carefully, without tearing, press foil into place in pan. 
</P>
<P>
Place 1 to 2 tablespoons butter in pan. Place pan in oven while preheating. 
When butter is melted, remove pan from oven and use pastry brush to spread 
butter over sides and bottom of foil. Set pan aside. 
</P>
<P>
Place chocolate and unsalted butter in top of large double boiler over hot 
water on moderate heat or in 4- to 6-cup heavy saucepan over very low heat. 
Stir occasionally until chocolate and butter are melted. Stir to mix. Remove 
from heat and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Beat eggs with vanilla, almond extract, salt, dry instant coffee and sugar in 
large bowl of electric mixer at high speed 10 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add 
chocolate mixture and beat only until mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Add flour and again beat only until mixed. Remove from mixer and stir in nuts. 
Turn into prepared pan and smooth top. 
</P>
<P>
Bake on rack 1/3 up from bottom of oven at 425 degrees 35 minutes, reversing 
pan front to back as necessary during baking to ensure even baking. At end of 
35 minutes cake will have thick, crisp crust on top, but wood pick inserted in 
center will come out wet and covered with chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, remove cake from oven and let stand at room temperature until 
cool. Cover with rack or baking sheet and invert. Remove pan and foil lining. 
Cover with baking sheet and invert again, leaving cake right side up. 
</P>
<P>
Let cake stand 6 to 8 hours, or preferably overnight, before cutting into bars. 
Or refrigerate few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Use serrated bread knife for slicing. If ends are too dark, cut away, then cut 
cake into bars. Wipe knife blade with damp cloth after each cut. Makes 24 huge 
or 32 large brownies. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Wrap brownies individually in plastic wrap.
