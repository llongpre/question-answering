<TEXT>     In Chinatown, where the Mee Mee Bakery has been turning out fortune cookies
for some 50 years, drivers and pedestrians live by the credo "Hit or be hit.";
  Which is why the first thing you should do before visiting the bakery is
ditch the car. Exit the freeway, pull into the first parking garage you see
and walk.;   After all, Chinatown is such an interesting place to find
yourself carried along by a crowd on a sidewalk.;   Near the intersection of
Broadway and Stockton Street, the Mee Mee is sandwiched between those
ubiquitous Chinatown shops that sell embroidered women's slippers for 59 cents
and the open-air produce markets that always seem to be doing turn-away
business in vegetables most greenhorn visitors can't even begin to identify.; 
 Every block or two, there's a crowd of men loudly advising some hapless phone
company or municipal worker on how to get the job done right, which probably
would be helpful if the worker understood Chinese.;   By the time you reach
the Mee Mee Bakery nothing can surprise you, except perhaps that fortune
cookies now come in chocolate and strawberry as well as original recipe.;  
Not only that, these days you can write your own fortune, says Simon Chow, a
member of the family that owns and runs the Mee Mee. For $14 for a minimum
order of 100 cookies ($19 if you want chocolate or strawberry flavor), Mee
Mee's staff will print up fortunes of your own devising and stick them in
cookies.;   It's a cheap way to change your fate.;   Chow will also let you
walk past the boxes of cookies ready for shipping to restaurants and stores
and watch the cookie-making process, as long as you promise not to touch
anything.;   As the Mee Mee's two cookie making machines squeak and sigh, the
flour-and-sugar cookie batter is sucked up a tube from a plastic container and
squirted into round molds. The top of the molds close over the batter, and the
nascent cookie methodically moves through a gas-flame oven.;   The cookies are
baked just a couple of minutes, says Chow, and when they come out, they're
still pliable enough to fold.;   The folding used to be done by hand by
workers who would flip the cookies and insert the fortunes. Now, a machine
does both, more tirelessly than the most indefatigable human cookie folder.;  
The Mee Mee's machines can turn out 20 fortune cookies a minute, and they run
about 10 hours a day, says Chow.;   That's 12,000 cookies a day, some of them
stuffed with biblical sayings, some of them stuffed with adults-only sayings,
some of them stuffed with age-old sayings whose wisdom cannot be disputed,
such as "You love Chinese food.";   Chow and his family still make the other
sweets by hand. In the front of the shop, they sell almond cookies, ginger
cookies, flaky winter melon cake, preserved egg turnovers and other delicacies
whose names are printed only in Chinese.;   And, of course, fortune cookies.
The regular ones are $2.80 a pound. Exotic flavors or those with biblical or
adult sayings are $3.90 a pound.; DETAILS; The Mee Mee Bakery, 1328 Stockton
St., San Francisco, is open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. The best
time to see the cookies is after 10 a.m., when the batter is made and the
machines are baking. There is a municipal parking garage on Vallejo between
Powell and Stockton, about three blocks from the bakery.  </TEXT>
