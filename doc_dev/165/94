RESTAURANT REVIEW: KAKTUS UNVEILS NEW MENU THAT MOVES TOWARD L.A.-MEX 
CLASSICISM

Here's a trend that doesn't seem likely to go away: elegant Mexican restaurants 
where an enchilada isn't basically mass quantities of cheese and sour cream, 
and where margaritas come, if at all, in glasses distinctly smaller than your 
head. 
</P>
<P>
We needn't be talking about anything experimental and Southwestern. The food 
could be just neat and refined versions of the Mexican dishes we've been eating 
all these years: nothing regional, nothing mesquite-smoked or cooked in banana 
leaves, nothing wild. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing wild is sort of the style at Kaktus, which has been purveying neat and 
refined Mexican food to Beverly Hills since early last year. The whole style of 
the place is a little subdued. No neon, no mirrors, no murals -- hardly any 
decor at all, except for some geometric spots of turquoise, a Day of the Dead 
mask here and there and a tiny potted kaktus plant at every table. 
</P>
<P>
Still, things change even at Kaktus. It just got a new menu, which has moved a 
little bit away from the pan-nouvelle tendencies of L.A. restaurants. There's 
no more attempt to serve American Heart Assn. dishes, so far as I can tell. The 
items that seemed like compromises with California cuisine are gone, such as 
chicken in ground sweet pepper sauce. 
</P>
<P>
These are no great losses, at least gastronomically. On the other hand, the 
only tamale left is the tiny, unstuffed tamalito, a little pillow of sweet 
steamed corn pudding. The seafood cocktails seem to be gone, though there's 
still a solid ceviche generous with green olives. I do miss one dish, roasted 
fish served with a mixture of red chiles and fried garlic chips. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, much is the same. They still bring you a thin, dark green, very 
appetizing salsa in a pitted stone mortar. It smells largely of vinegar and 
cilantro, and with it comes crumbly white cheese and thick, home-style corn 
tortillas. Kaktus still uses no bean that is not a black bean, for instance in 
its frijoles refritos and its tostadas. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the black bean is the official bean of the '80s, as goat cheese is 
the official cheese, and here Kaktus is still marching with the crowd. In fact, 
it may be using more goat cheese than before, sometimes prompting one to wonder 
whether sharp, rank goat cheese should always be the queso of choice. Camarones 
Cancun -- bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp stuffed with goat cheese -- lead to such 
dark ruminations. 
</P>
<P>
So what have we got? Chewy sopes topped with potato and the restaurant's own 
chorizo, as well as beans. . . . Plump quesadillas made from small folded 
tortillas and excellent, subtle cheese. . . . A combo plate that includes these 
two plus ceviche, a couple of miniature tostadas, a tamalito and guacamole. . . 
. Tortilla soup, and a fresh-tasting chicken lime soup that itself has a couple 
of tortilla strips in it. 
</P>
<P>
Whoa, this looks new: pavo Azteca, essentially turkey scaloppine in a sweet 
dark mole sauce that tastes as if it has honey in it. This may not be what you 
call a showcase for the flavor of turkey, but the delicious sauce will use up 
many a tortilla. Chicken breast now comes in a snappy light chipotle sauce. Or 
so they call it; this red-orange sauce scarcely has any of the smoky flavor of 
a chipotle pepper. Some other things -- enchiladas, for instance -- get the 
same pleasant, neutral, slightly hot red-orange sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Pavo tequila somehow sounds like something from the old menu: duck breast in a 
molasses sauce (a little less sweet than it sounds) dashed with tequila. It's 
an oddly sensible thing to do to duck, though a bit of raw alcohol flavor does 
show up in the sauce. Serape, I'm sure, is from the old menu: a filet steak 
pounded about as thin as a tortilla, nearly covering the dinner plate. It's 
topped with a hash of fried onions with a couple of mild peppers mixed in, 
making this a surreal sort of steak smothered in onions. 
</P>
<P>
At dessert time, the rice pudding is gone, and the range of flans is down to 
one: a plain one with a nice resilient texture. The crepes with toasted almonds 
are still around, but no longer with any claim of chocolate in the caramel 
sauce. They're probably the best of the desserts, and in a crazy way the most 
Mexican in effect, the crepes turning soggy in the sauce as if in a sweet 
cousin of budin Azteca, the dish Americans turned into tamale pie. The other 
desserts are L.A. staples, such as a chocolate mousse like chocolate-candy 
filling served in slab form. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, things are still unfailingly neat and refined; the only trouble on 
this horizon seems to be the grilled zucchini slices, which sometimes get 
practically blackened. Kaktus has made its culinary direction quite clear, a 
sort of L.A.-Mex classicism.
