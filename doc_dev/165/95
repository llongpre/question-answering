   The government has some sweet news for
candy-loving Poles: the rationing of chocolate will be lifted on
Tuesday.
   Newspapers on Monday printed an official announcement on the end
of the rationing, but no explanation was given for the decision.
   Under the rationing system, parents could only buy 7 ounces of
chocolate a month for each child under 16 _ about two candy bars a
month.
   Adult chocolate-lovers did not receive a monthly ration for
themselves.
   Until now, the only recourse was to buy chocolate on the black
market, in private shops or in government-run Western currency
stores for prices several times higher than the government-set
price for Polish-made chocolate products.
   Meat is the only food product still rationed in Poland. Since
introducing widespread food rationing in 1980-81, the government
has gradually lifted restrictions on purchases of grain products,
butter and cooking fats, alcohol, cigarettes and sugar. Gasoline is
still rationed for private car owners.
