<LEADPARA>  EVERY November, our friend Lupe prepares an elaborate feast of chicken
tamales, candied pumpkin and delicate chocolate merengues for her son, Tomas.
She spends hours shopping for and cooking his favorite foods, eagerly
anticipating how her labor of love will delight him.;   When the feast day
arrives, Lupe packs up her treats, along with some beer, two or three packs of
Marlboro cigarettes, candles and a huge armful of fiery orange marigolds. She
closes up the house and heads off to see Tomas where she always visits him --
at the cemetery.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Along with millions of others, Lupe is observing one of Mexico's most
important and ebullient holidays, the Day of the Dead. Celebrated every year
on Nov. 1 and 2, the Day of the Dead is the ultimate example of the Mexican
people's historic adaptability and unique perspective on mortality.;  
Contrary to medieval Spain's dark perception of death, indigenous Mexican
religion saw it as just one step in an unending cycle of being.;   Thus, when
the Spaniards introduced the Mexican people to All Souls' Day -- the day when
the faithful prayed for unredeemed souls trapped in purgatory -- some
adjustments had to be made. Rather than a time for solemn prayer, it became a
day of honor -- a buoyant, colorful, bountiful feast that celebrated the lives
of those who had passed on. And it was renamed "El Dia de Los Muertos," the
Day of the Dead.;   Muertos is celebrated today much the way it was hundreds
of years ago.;   Families arrive at cemeteries with armfuls of food and
zempasuchil (marigolds), crowding the once-silent grounds with brilliant
colors, wonderful smells and lively chatter.;   As with every other great
Mexican holy day, food plays a central role in the Muertos celebration. How
could a family better express its love for the deceased than by preparing all
the wonderful foods they enjoyed in life? There is also the hope that the
aroma of spicy dishes will reach the dead and lure them back for the holiday.;
  About a week before Muertos, bakeries fill up with wonderful breads prepared
specifically for the occasion. These rich, heavy loaves sometimes have painted
porcelain heads embedded in their dough or are decorated with braids and
painted with food coloring.;   And at the cemeteries, steaming hot tamales
made with corn husks or banana leaves are placed in huge piles on the graves,
along with rich moles of every variety and a kaleidoscope of colorful flowers,
candies and cookies. In the small villages outside of Huejutla in the state of
Hidalgo, musicians accompany masked performers as they dance atop tombstones
throughout the day on Nov. 2.;   After the deceased have had ample opportunity
to enjoy their food, families relax and feast on what's left, sometimes using
the tomb itself as a sort of picnic table. They then share their ofrendas with
visitors and others who may not have sufficient food to go around.;   The
significance of Muertos is never more apparent than at this moment. While so
many cultures tremble in death's shadow, Mexicans have long danced in a
playful minuet with mortality. This celebration is part of our life-long
fiesta, the last and forever-recurring feast that bridges life and death and
feeds both body and soul.; (hbox);   This special bread is traditionally
shaped in the form of a man, woman or child for the Muertos celebration.; 
CANDIED FRUIT BREAD; 1/2 cup lukewarm water; 1 ounce active dry yeast (1
heaping tablespoon); 8 generous cups flour; 1 tablespoon whole anise seeds; 1
cup granulated sugar; 1 tablespoon salt; 10 eggs; 3 cups butter; 3/4 cup
finely chopped candied figs; 3/4 cup finely chopped citron; 3/4 cup finely
chopped candied pineapple; 3/4 cup finely chopped candied pumpkin (optional); 
Powdered sugar;  Place lukewarm water in medium bowl. Add yeast and stir until
well dissolved. Add about 1 cup flour and stir until mixture can be shaped
into a ball. If necessary, add a little more water. Cover with clean cloth and
set aside in warm, draft-free spot.;   Place remaining flour on flat surface.
Form well in center of flour and fill with anise seeds, granulated sugar, salt
and eggs. Knead ingredients together, evenly incorporating them. Knead 15-25
minutes until dough becomes elastic and is no longer sticky. (You may knead
with food processor if preferred; it will drastically reduce kneading time.); 
 Add yeast mixture and continue kneading until dough is silky. If dough is too
dry (depending on climate and quality of flour), add a little milk to moisten.
Gradually add butter and knead dough until soft. Shape into single ball and
place in greased bowl. Coat with a little oil and cover with clean cloth.
Place in warm, draft-free place until dough doubles in size. Punch down. Cover
and refrigerate overnight.;   The next day, add candied fruits to dough,
kneading briefly. Shape dough into a human figure or make a braid. Place on
greased baking sheet. Cover with cloth and allow to rise again, for 1 hour.;  
Bake at 375 degrees 30 to 40 minutes or until bread is golden brown. Remove
from oven and allow to cool. Before serving, sprinkle with powdered sugar.
Serve warm with butter, preserves and cups of hot chocolate. Makes 8 to 10
servings.; (hbox);   No Muertos altar is complete without freshly made flan.; 
FLAN (CARAMELIZED EGG CUSTARD);  Burnt Sugar Topping:; 2 1/2 cups sugar; 1 1/3
cups water;  Custard:; 10 eggs plus 4 egg yolks; 2 cups sweetened condensed
milk; 2 cups whole milk; 2 1/2 cups evaporated milk; 2 tablespoons vanilla; 
To prepare Burnt Sugar Topping, combine sugar and water in heavy saucepan.
Stir well. Simmer over low heat until sugar completely dissolves and mixture
is dark brown in color. Pour burnt sugar into 10-inch ungreased ring mold,
tipping mold to evenly line bottom. Allow to cool.;   To prepare Custard, beat
eggs and egg yolks together. Pour the 3 milks in separate mixing bowl and stir
well. Blend eggs with milk, then stir in vanilla. Pour custard into prepared
ring mold. Place in pan filled with 1 inch of water. Bake at 350 degrees 1 1/2
hours or until wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean. Allow to
cool, then refrigerate overnight. Unmold before serving. Serve chilled. Makes
8 to 12 servings.; (hbox);  CANDIED SWEET POTATOES WITH CINNAMON AND CLOVES
(LOS CAMOTES);  Syrup:; 6 cups water; 4 cups granulated sugar; 4 1/2 cups dark
brown sugar, packed; 2 cinnamon sticks, each 3-inches long; 6 whole cloves; 
Potatoes:; 4 large yellow sweet potatoes (1 pound each), peeled; 1/4 cup
butter, melted;  To prepare Syrup, pour water into medium saucepan. Add
sugars, cinnamon sticks and cloves and cook 2 1/2 hours or until syrup is
thick.;   Arrange sweet potatoes in large baking dish with lid. Pour melted
butter over potatoes. Bake, covered, at 350 degrees 2 hours or until done,
basting sweet potatoes with butter every 20 minutes. Test with toothpick or
fork to be sure they are tender. Pour syrup over potatoes and serve. Makes 6
to 8 servings.  </TEXT>
