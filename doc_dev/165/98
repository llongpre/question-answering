   If Jaguars and diamonds are a little pricey and
store-bought baubles aren't personal enough for those on your list,
gifts fresh from your kitchen in attractive reusable containers
make doubly delightful presents.
   The time, thoughtfulness and care that go into something
hand-made touch us all, and part of the pleasure is looking for
reusable containers. I've found them in all sorts of places.
Import-export stores have pottery, glass, baskets, from all over
the world. A thrift or antique shop may unearth a charming tray or
vintage Mason jars, and local artisans offer one-of-a-kind pieces
for the kitchen and home that will be treasured for years.
   Anything will be happily received, from a cut glass cruet for
your homemade vinegar to a tiny, tiered jewelry box with each
drawer filled with tantalizing two-bite confections.
   When it comes time to stir things up in the kitchen, be sure to
include your grandchildren, or any small children for that matter.
The sights, sounds and smells enliven the creative spirit, and
simple tasks such as helping stuff dates and rolling out cookies
are just the ticket. They can have the fun of making a present for
a teacher or treats for stocking-stuffers.
   Following are some suggestions for your Christmas or Hannukkah
table and for gift-giving. This holiday season we most certainly
want to offer the precious gift of our time to programs in church,
synagogue or school to cook and serve a holiday meal to people
without the warmth and love of home and hearth and family.
