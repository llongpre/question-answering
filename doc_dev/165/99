<LEADPARA>  NOW that public schools are back in session, it's time for some of us to get
back into the often-dreaded lunch-box packing routine.;   One thing I have
learned is that you must be realistic and select foods your child likes and
will feel comfortable eating in front of other children. Otherwise, you're
just wasting your time and money because the disliked food items will end up
in the trash.  </LEADPARA>

NEW FOODS PERK UP KIDS' LUNCHES (BUT TRY 'EM AT
HOME FIRST)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Let's face it," writes Ellen Klavan in her recently released "The Creative
Lunch Box," (Crown Publishers, $7). "You can control what goes into your
child's lunch box every day, but you can't control what goes into your
child.";   To win at lunch-making chores this school year, keep in mind some
of Klavan's suggestions.;   Get children into the act of preparing lunches.;  
Try out new recipes at home before packing them in a child's lunch, and allow
the child to have veto power.;   Follow the basic four food groups (meat or
protein equivalent; grains; dairy products; fruits and vegetables) and common
sense in putting together tasty and nutritious lunches.;   Add some fun to the
lunch -- stickers to seal sandwich wrappers, colorful or holiday-themed paper
napkins, a crazy straw, colorful forks or spoons, a personalized loving note
or a riddle.;   Here are some recipes from Klavan's "The Creative Lunch Box.";
POCKET PIZZA; 1 pocket pita bread; 1 to 2 teaspoons pizza or spaghetti sauce;
2 tablespoons mozzarella cheese; 2 tablespoons toppings: chopped green pepper,
chopped onion, chopped olives, salami, etc.;  Cut a slit in the top third of
the pita pocket. Spread pizza or spaghetti sauce all around inside the pita.
Add mozzarella cheese and your child's favorite pizza topping(s). Makes 1
serving.;   (hbox);   These Chicken Chunks taste every bit as good as the kind
You Know McWho makes.; CHICKEN CHUNKS; 1  whole boneless skinless chicken
breast; 2 tablespoons flour;  Pinch salt;  Pinch pepper; 2 tablespoons milk; 1
egg (optional); 1/2 cup bread crumbs; Ketchup, barbecue sauce or
sweet-and-sour sauce;  Wash and dry chicken breast, then cut into bite-size
chunks. In a shallow bowl, mix flour, salt and pepper. Dredge chicken in flour
mixture. In small bowl, place milk and egg, if desired. Dunk chicken nuggets
in liquid, then roll in bread crumbs. At this point, you can freeze the
nuggets.;   To prepare, put as many nuggets as your child wants for lunch on a
cookie sheet. Bake in preheated 425-degree oven 10 to 15 minutes. (Cut into
one to make sure it is cooked through.) Chill thoroughly. Wrap nuggets in foil
and send them to school in a cool, insulated lunch box. Send along a small
container of ketchup, barbecue sauce or sweet-and-sour sauce. Makes about 4
(6-nugget) servings.;   (hbox);   This dessert is a compromise. On one hand,
it's made with chocolate, but on the other hand, the main ingredient is
wholesome fruit.; CHOCOLATE-COVERED FRUIT; 1 tablespoon margarine; 3/4 cup
evaporated milk; 6 ounces milk chocolate, broken into pieces;  Chunks of
fruit: pineapple, banana, apple, mandarin orange sections, strawberries and so
on;  Over low heat, in a thick-bottomed pan, melt margarine. Stir in
evaporated milk and milk chocolate. Stir steadily until chocolate melts and
mixture is rich, smooth and creamy. Turn off heat. Skewer fruit on toothpicks
and dip them in chocolate. Place chocolate-covered fruit on waxed paper. When
all fruit is dipped, place in freezer to harden. When ready for school, put
fruit in a lidded plastic container and make sure your child's lunch box is
cool so chocolate doesn't melt.;   (hbox);   If your kid prefers chocolate
milk to plain milk, offer this drink as an alternative. The banana makes the
milk taste sweet and thick.; BANANA DRINK; 3/4 cup milk; 1/2 ripe banana; 1/2
teaspoon vanilla; Pinch ground cinnamon; 1 ice cube;   Put all ingredients in
blender and process until drink is smooth. Pour immediately into a prechilled
thermos. Makes 1 serving.;   (hbox);   If your child is a true peanut
butter-aholic, he'll probably want peanut butter and jelly on peanut butter
bread! Try to get him to experiment a little -- with a cream cheese/raisin
spread or cottage cheese and apple. You can use crunchy or smooth peanut
butter in this recipe.;  PEANUT BUTTER BREAD; 1 egg; 1/2 cup peanut butter;
1/4 cup honey; 3/4 cup milk; 2 cups flour; 2 teaspoons baking powder; 1/2
teaspoon baking soda; 1/2 teaspoon salt;   In large bowl, beat egg. Mix in
peanut butter, honey and milk. In medium-size bowl, combine flour, baking
powder, baking soda and salt. Add flour mixture to peanut butter mixture. Mix
until all dry ingredients have been moistened. When dough is smooth and
elastic, spoon into a greased 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Bake in preheated
350-degree oven about 45 minutes or until bread tests done.  </TEXT>
