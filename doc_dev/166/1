YOUTH BEAT: AUSTRALIA OPENS THREE NEW LOW-COST HOSTELS 
</P>

Three key Australian cities -- Sydney, Melbourne and Cairns -- have new hostels 
for budget travelers. 
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, it's not just the youth hostel that's appealing. One of the city's 
charms is that it offers visitors the opportunity to take in city sights and 
enjoy the beach life as well. 
</P>
<P>
You can start your day in the central city area with a visit to the Australian 
Museum and a walking tour through the 200-year-old historic district known as 
"The Rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Then you can take a 10-minute ferry trip across the harbor to Manly Beach, or 
grab a bus to the popular surfing suburb of Bondi Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sydney's new flagship youth hostel, Hereford Lodge, has a pool, sauna, rooftop 
recreation area, TV and video lounge, plus a low-cost cafeteria. It's at 51 
Hereford St. in Glebe. 
</P>
<P>
The hostel has 92 rooms. The price per person in a twin room is about $14 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne Cup 
</P>
<P>
If you want to experience the exciting atmosphere of one of Australia's premier 
sports events, plan to be in the Melbourne area on the first Tuesday in 
November. The city comes to a halt as everyone focuses attention on Australia's 
most important horse race, the Melbourne Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne area is also one of the most popular spots to enjoy another 
Australian custom -- the BYO (bring your own) restaurants. These are 
establishments that allow you to furnish your own wine or beer to enjoy with 
your meal. The minimum drinking age in Australia is 18. 
</P>
<P>
Melbourne's new youth hostel is at 118 Lonsdale St. It can accommodate up to 
140 people, who are charged $13 each night. 
</P>
<P>
Cairns, on Australia's northeastern coast, draws travelers to investigate the 
Great Barrier Reef. The town has several hostels that compete for business from 
young visitors. In addition to accommodations, they offer opportunities for 
economical trips to the rain forest, plus river rafting and sailing adventures. 
</P>
<P>
The new Cairns youth hostel is at 20-24 McLeon St. just opposite the railway 
station. The single-room rate is $12 a night. A bed in a twin room costs $9, 
while a bed in a dormitory room is $7. 
</P>
<P>
All three youth hostels are members of a network of 130 Australian hostels 
affiliated with the International Youth Hostel Federation. If you are not a 
member of your own national youth hostel association, they may request that you 
buy a guest membership, or pay a few dollars extra per night. There are no age 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Australia also has many independent budget-priced hostels. They tend to supply 
information about each other, so once you start using them you can find out 
about others. 
</P>
<P>
The youth hostels offer young travelers a good place to exchange information 
and develop friendships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On-Site Vans 
</P>
<P>
When several people begin to travel together, the variety of opportunities 
expand. You can begin to consider new options such as buying a cheap car and 
making more use of campgrounds, where you'll discover another Australian 
novelty, the on-site van. 
</P>
<P>
These are recreational vehicles parked in permanent positions in campgrounds; 
you can rent them by the night or week. 
</P>
<P>
One free source of information about budget accommodations, including some 
youth hostels, budget hotels, tourist homes and campgrounds, is a publication 
called "Destination Australia." 
</P>
<P>
The guide also covers basic information on what to see and do in key tourism 
areas, and offers advice on a variety of services such as bus passes and tour 
operators. Copies are available from the Australian Tourist Commission, 2121 
Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1200, Los Angeles 90067, (213) 552-1988. 
</P>
<P>
If you need to make transportation arrangements after you arrive in Australia, 
keep in mind that STA Travel (formerly Student Travel Australia) has offices in 
Hobart, Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth, Townsville and Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
The company specializes in services for all young travelers. They also have a 
network of offices in other countries, including Indonesia, so they can help 
with arrangements and information when you want to move on from Australia.
