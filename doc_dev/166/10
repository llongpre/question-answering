Shell Australia and BP Australia, both part of the larger international oil
groups, are being sued by the Trade Practices Commission, Australia's
competition watchdog, over alleged price collusion in the Sydney and
Melbourne retail petrol markets. Shell issued a statement yesterday stating
that it would 'mount a vigorous defence' against allegations that it
colluded with other oil companies to increase retail petroleum prices in
Melbourne and Sydney between 1988 and 1991. BP Australia confirmed that it,
too, was served with legal proceedings by the Commission yesterday. These,
it said, alleged certain anti-competitive practices in the Sydney and
Melbourne motor spirit markets between May 1991 and June 1992.
