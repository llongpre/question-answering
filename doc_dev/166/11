  [Text] Brisbane, March 16 (CNA) -- Australia and the 
Republic of China [ROC] are scheduled to hold talks in Melbourne 
later this month to discuss expansion of the current air links 
between the two countries, the Taipei Economic and Cultural 
Office (TECO) in Canberra said Wednesday [16 March]. 
  TECO Representative Francias Li said the ROC delegation 
would 
be led by Sun Chao-liang, director-general of the Civil 
Aeronautics Administration, and his Australian counterpart would 
be Australia's representative in Taiwan. 
  Officials from the Australian Transport Department, 
Australian Asia Airlines (AAA), Eva Air and Mandarin Airways 
will take part in the two-day meetings on March 24 and 25. 
  Li said the ROC delegates are expected to arrive in 
Melbourne 
on March 23. 
  "The purpose of the meeting is to discuss bilateral 
expansion 
of the current air links between our two countries," he said. 
  He said the issue was first raised by the officials of AAA, 
a 
subsidiary of Qantas Airways, last year. 
  Australia signed an aviation agreement with the ROC in early 
1991. 
  AAA inaugurated its flights to Taipei from Sydney and 
Brisbane on October 11 the same year. 
  Mandarin Airways followed suit a week later with direct 
flights between Taipei and Sydney. Eva air started flying to 
Sydney and Brisbane from Taipei in September 1993. 
  Under the 1991 agreement, airlines from the two countries 
are 
allowed to provide four weekly flight between Taipei and Sydney 
and Brisbane. Additional flights on this route have to be 
approved first by either Taipei or Canberra. 
  AAA has maximized its services with four weekly flights 
while 
Mandarin and Eva provide two weekly flights each. 
  But a faster-than-expected tourist flow from Taiwan to 
Australia last year has called for more flights and the airlines 
operating the route are very profitable, airlines officials said. 
  Eva Air has been forced to offer an extra flight to meet 
growing demand, company representative in Sydney Peter Kwoh said 
in an interview. 
  "All airlines operating between Taipei and Sydney and 
Brisbane are making profits thanks to a surge in the number of 
tourists from Taiwan," he said. 
  The number of tourist arrivals from Taiwan going to 
Australia 
hit a record high of nearly 109,000 last year, up from 63,500 in 
1992, according to the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC). 
  Tourists from Australia going to Taiwan totalled more than 
20,000, up only slightly from a year earlier. 
  "The Taipei route has been known as the golden route for 
many 
years," Kwoh said, adding "because more and more affluent Taiwan 
residents like to travel overseas." 
  "They are big spenders in Australia," an ATC official said. 
  China Airlines, a parent company of Mandarin, said this 
month 
that its subsidiary would expand its current Taipei-Sydney 
flights to Brisbane later this year. 
  "I believe all the airlines operating between the ROC and 
Australia will cash in on the growing tourist flow to share a 
bigger market pie," TECO's Li said.
