The University of San Diego men's basketball team began its season with a 91-81 
exhibition victory over Australia's Eastside Melbourne Spectres Friday at the 
USD Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
Senior John Jerome, who red-shirted last season, led USD with 21 points. Senior 
Craig Cottrell added 10 points. Shawn Hamilton, a community college transfer 
from Mesa, Ariz., had seven rebounds, and freshman Pat Holbert had eight 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
USD took an 8-2 lead and never trailed. It took its biggest lead of the half, 
42-26, with a 10-0 run with four minutes remaining. The Toreros, who 
substituted freely, had a 27-point lead five minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 7:35, Jerome (6-feet-8) scored 14 of the Toreros' first 23 points, 
including two three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
USD shot well from the floor -- 58% (38 of 66) -- but converted on just 10 of 
17 free throws, three of seven in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Eastside Melbourne was led by Steve deLaveaga's 22 points. DeLaveaga normally 
plays for San Diego's High Five America, but Melbourne was permitted to use two 
American players.

U.S. International opens its season tonight (7:30) at Serra High against the 
same Eastside Melbourne team. JIM LINDGREN
