   Rupert Murdoch's NEWS CORP. sold its two Australian television stations to WESTFIELD CAPITAL CORP. of Sydney. 
Westfield paid News Corp. the equivalent of $555 million for the stations in Sydney and Melbourne, as well as some small newspapers, radio stations and a recording business. 

   News Corp. had said it would sell the television stations and concentrate in Australia on the print media. 
The sale partially offsets the cost of News Corp.'s acquisition of Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd., which leaves Mr. Murdoch's company with about 50% of the total newspaper circulation in Australia's major cities. 

   Westfield Capital, meanwhile, enters the scramble among Australian companies to set up television networks. 
Westfield will hold its newly acquired media interests through its 20%-owned Northern Star Holdings Ltd., which already owns newspapers, radio stations and two television stations in smaller cities. 

   Westfield's managing director, David Gonski, said: "Our No. 1 priority will be to go nationwide, either by linking with other networks or by acquisition." 
Analysts said one possibility would be a link with businessman Kerry Stokes, who bought Herald's television station in Adelaide and also owns a station in Canberra and a license for a station in Perth. 

   Bond Corp. last month became the first company to set up a television network covering most major Australian cities, and John Fairfax Ltd. is in position to establish a second network after adding Herald's Melbourne station to its television operations in Sydney and Brisbane.
