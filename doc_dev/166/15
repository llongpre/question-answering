   A 12-year-old stowaway who wanted to go to
American but ended up in Australia by mistake arrived back in Vienna
today at the end of a 19,000-mile airborne adventure.
   Kristofer Dobrowski was questioned by police and then handed back
to his Polish-born mother, officials at Schwechat airport told The
Associated Press. His home address was not released.
   Airline officials were at a loss to explain the incident but said
they were checking security systems.
   Dobrowski was put on a Vienna-bound plane in Australia late
Thursday after he was discovered in the transit lounge of Sydney's
airport without a ticket, travel papers or identity documents.
   ``He is knee-high to a grasshopper,'' said one Australian
immigration officer. ``It seems he wanted to go to America and
mistook the Qantas flight destination of Melbourne for Miami.''
   With the help of an interpreter, officials found that Dobrowski
had flown undetected from Vienna to Bangkok, and on to Hong Kong and
Melbourne before being picked up in Sydney.
   Immigration spokesman Geoff Smith said officials became
suspicious when they realized the boy spoke no English, was
traveling alone and had no travel documents.
   Dobrowski, who is Polish but lives with his mother in Vienna,
said he was unhappy at his mother's recent remarriage. He said he
did not like his stepfather, so he decided to run away.
   ``He left home Saturday and went to Vienna Airport where he
somehow boarded an Air Lauda jet for Bangkok and Hong Kong,'' said
the spokesman. ``He stayed in Hong Kong for two days in the transit
area, mostly sleeping while he recovered from his flight from Europe
to Asia.''
   When he overcame his jetlag, Dobrowski tagged along with a family
that was flying to Australia, apparently managing to pick up a
boarding pass he found on the ground and use it to join a flight to
Melbourne.
   ``But Australia wasn't Kristofer's chosen destination. With his
poor understanding of English, he mistook Melbourne for Miami, which
is where he really wanted to go _ America,'' said the official
demanded anonymity.
   Qantas paid for him to stay the night at the Airport Hilton Hotel
before putting him on a plane home _ as a first-class passenger.
