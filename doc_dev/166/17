  [Text] China's biggest trade and investment delegation to 
ever visit Australia is continuing to generate multimillion 
dollar deals for local companies. About 500 business people, 
including 119 Chinese representatives, are today meeting at an 
investment forum in Sydney. Last week's first session of the 
forum in Melbourne resulted in 147 letters of intent worth a 
potential $1.2 billion [Australian]. Managing Director of the 
Australian Trade Commission Ralph Evans says the Chinese 
delegation has an extensive shopping list. 
  [Begin Evans recording] There were up to $10 billion worth 
of projects and that $1.2 billion on which there have been 
companies that have signed initial letters of intent represents 
12 percent of that. So, they have come with a very extensive 
shopping list and we would hope that more of it can be tapped 
into during the session here in Sydney today. [end recording]
