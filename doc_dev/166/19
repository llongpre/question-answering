Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, and Circus Circus, the large US
gaming group, yesterday lost their joint bid to build the USDollars 1bn-plus
Sydney casino complex, which is forecast to have annual gaming revenues of
around ADollars 500m (USDollars 357.1m) when it comes on stream in 1997.
Instead, the New South Wales Casino Control Authority announced yesterday
the winning development proposal had been submitted by Leighton Holdings,
the stock market-listed Australian engineering and construction group in
which Hochtief, the German construction group, has a 48 per cent
shareholding.
Although the CCA stressed no one factor had influenced its decision, the
Leighton bid - made in conjunction with Showboat, a US casino group -
offered a much higher upfront payment to the NSW state in return for the
casino licence.
The consortium has promised to pay ADollars 441m over three years, or
ADollars 376m as a single upfront sum - a figure which even Mr Chris Cullen,
the CCA chairman, described as 'exceptional'.
Mr Packer - whose involvement in the rival consortium was through his Nine
Network and Consolidated Press companies - said his group had 'bid our
maximum price and came up over ADollars 80m short'. 'On that basis,
(Leighton/Showboat) deserved to win and good luck to them,' said the
businessman, known to be a keen gambler himself.
The Sydney casino is the last, and largest, in a string of such development
announcements in Australia. Growth in the industry is expected to explode
over the next three years. Casinos are due to come on stream in Cairns,
Brisbane and Melbourne during that time and - with Sydney included - the
country's total annual gross casino revenues could top ADollars 2bn by the
late-1990s. Mr Packer already has connections with - and a potential direct
interest in - the Melbourne property.
The Sydney casino has always been seen as a 'prize' because of the city's
strong Asian tourist trade. In addition to the upfront licence payment, the
state expects to get annual tax revenues of around ADollars 100m once it
starts operating.
The Leighton/Showboat proposal includes a five-star hotel, serviced
apartments, a floorshow theatre and a 2,000-seat lyric theatre, as well as
the 'themed' casino with its 170 gaming tables and 1,480 gaming machines.
Leighton said the consortium company, called Sydney Harbour Casino, would be
floated by 1995.
