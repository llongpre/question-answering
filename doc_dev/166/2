  [Text] Direct air links between Melbourne and Japan are 
set to be restored. State political reporter Tony Allen says it 
follows meetings between Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett and 
Australia's international airline, Qantas. 
  [Begin recording] [Allen] Mr. Kennett declared a personal 
black ban on Qantas and Ansett international services to 
illustrate his concern at the airlines using Sydney as their 
base. Now, after talks with Mr. Kennett, Qantas has announced a 
plan for a weekly direct flight to Osaka's new Kansai Airport. 
  Mr. Kennett said it takes up an unused Ansett right that 
expires in November. 
  [Kennett] And we will support Qantas to get that flight 
awarded to Qantas. If that is the case, then we are able then 
to establish ourselves and to (?prove) up the value of that 
flight. [end recording] 
  As well, Qantas will add three new flights from Melbourne to 
Los Angeles via Auckland from the end of October. Qantas says 
it is more expensive to fly from Melbourne than from the Sydney 
and Queensland tourist markets, but if the new flights prove a 
success, there will be more.
