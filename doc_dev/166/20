   Vice President Dan Quayle, acting like
a political candidate on a whistlestop tour of Australia, quaffed
beer at a local pub, hit tennis balls with underprivileged children
and mingled with crowds in two cities today.
   Obviously enjoying himself on the third day of his trip, Quayle
paid a surprise visit to the wood-paneled pub at the Lord Nelson
Brewery Hotel where his brief stop stunned the clientele.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Kim Ivey, a banker who was
drinking at the bar with friends in mid-afternoon. ``We were
standing here and he walked up and said, `Hi. I'm Dan Quayle.'''
   Quayle, sipping a glass of Hahn beer, chatted with the young
women behind the bar, joked with proprietor Blair Hayden about his
golfing tie and suggested two patrons attend a black-tie dinner at
which he's the guest of honor.
   He called the beer _ which is Australia's national drink _ good,
but added, ``It has a bite.''
   Ann Larson, 25, an administrator at IBM who chatted with Quayle
said, ``It was great. He is really nice.'' She said her friends
``will be spewing. They'll be so jealous.''
   The pub stop capped a day in which Quayle spent much of his time
shaking hands and posing for pictures, including several on a boat
tour of Sydney's breathtaking harbor.
   The good-natured touring was in contrast to the first days of
Quayle's first trip to the Pacific region. The vice president has
highlighted the U.S.-Australia defense alliance, but Australian
officials have protested export subsidies the United States places
on wheat, subsidies the Australians say hurt their exports abroad.
   Australian officials who hoped Quayle would say the subsidies
were ending were angered at his public comments. Quayle said at a
news conference on Thursday, ``We do not believe that it (the
subsidy program) is injuring Australia.''
   Senior government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Prime Minister Bob Hawke was exasperated at Quayle's stance in
a private meeting. Hawke said on Thursday that the losses ``are not
figments of our imagination. They are cold, hard and brutally
hurtful economic statistics which have adversely affected our
farmers, our wheat farmers.''
   The country's major national newspaper, The Australian, was more
blunt in an editorial, saying, ``Who do you think you are kidding,
Mr. Quayle? Read our lips, Mr. Quayle. Australians are not happy.''
   The vice president and his wife, Marilyn, flew here from
Melbourne, their second stop on their five-day trip to Australia.
   Taking a cue from President Bush, who sometimes spontaneously
stops his motorcade to mix with the crowds, Quayle jumped out of
his limousine in downtown Melbourne to shake hands outside one of
the city's landmarks, the clocks at the Flinders Street train
station.
   Quayle, trailed by local reporters, also insisted on walking
near the waterfront in Sydney, much to the consternation of his
Secret Service agents. ``I wish he would get in the car,'' one
agent said in an exasperated tone.
   Before he left Melbourne, Quayle laid a wreath at a war memorial
where a brass plaque honors U.S. Marines who fought at Guadalcanal
in World War II.
   He also stopped by the National Tennis Center, home of the
Australian Open, to honor Oz Tennis, a charity that gives poor
children the chance to learn the game. The vice president hit
tennis balls there with former Wimbledon doubles champion Paul
McNamee and 11-year-old Michael Memedev.
