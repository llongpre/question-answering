   John Fairfax Group Proprietary Ltd.,
which owns the Sydney Morning Herald and three other major
Australian publications, was placed into receivership Monday after
banks called in outstanding debts.
   John Fairfax, one of Australia's two major newspaper groups
along with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd., owes about 1.7 billion
Australian dollars, or $1.31 billion, to its creditors.
   Company officials said directors asked for the appointment of a
provisional liquidator for the group's finance division after banks
refused to agree to a rollover of a debt of 850 million Australian
dollars, or $654 million.
   The Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu accountancy firm was then appointed
receiver and manager at the request of John Fairfax Group's banking
syndicate.
   The ANZ Bank and Citibank are owed about 1.2 billion Australian
dollars, or $850 million. The remaining debt is in the form of
high-yield, high-risk bonds.
   John Fairfax, Australia's oldest media organization, also owns
the Australian Financial Review, Business Review Weekly and The
(Melbourne) Age as well as the Herald in Sydney. The Herald is the
oldest English-language newspaper in the world continuously owned
by the same family.
   In early October, the company reported a net loss of 59.08
million Australian dollars, or $45.49 million, for the year ending
June 30.
   On Aug. 25, three top John Fairfax officials - Chief Executive
Chris Anderson, Chairman Brian Kelman and director Bob Johnston -
resigned amid continuing disputes on renegotiations of the debt.
   John Fairfax's problems have been mirrored at Murdoch's News
Corp. Ltd.
   In early October, Murdoch merged four of his newspapers into two
round-the-clock productions in Sydney and Melbourne. The moves came
amidst a plunge in the value of News Corp. stock that wiped out
more than 2 billion Australian dollars, or $1.66 billion, of the
company's market capitalization.
   Murdoch has been talking in recent weeks with bank lenders about
restructuring News Corp. debt and hopes to have a deal by early
next year.
   Other media outlets in Australia have fared poorly as well. Two
of the major private television stations are in receivership and
have fired hundreds of staff. The third recently reported a loss of
618 million Australian dollars, or $511 million.
