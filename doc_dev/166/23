When the Honorable John Cain, premier of the state of Victoria, Australia, 
passed through town the other day, he made a pitch to Los Angeles' chief 
executives to come invest Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
"They see the place as vibrant but expensive," Cain said in an interview after 
lunching with 10 chief executives at the California Club. He was en route to 
Puerto Rico to sell Melbourne as the site for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The city is up against Manchester, England; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Atlanta; 
Athens, and Toronto. If Melbourne wins, the Games are expected to help channel 
tourism and investment into Australia -- specifically Victoria, which is on the 
southeastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
Cain is selling Melbourne as a gateway to the Pacific with its 24-hour port, 
the largest in the Southern Hemisphere and the 10th-largest container port in 
the world. With Australia increasingly aligning itself with its Asia-Pacific 
neighbors, Cain said his state is part of the "most dynamic market at the 
moment." 
</P>

Diversifying Exports 
</P>
<P>
Since January, Australia has attempted to interest other Asia-Pacific countries 
in uniting to promote regional economic cooperation through a so-called Pacific 
Rim Initiative. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Bob Hawke invited 11 
countries, including the United States, to an initial meeting in Canberra in 
November to discuss the international economic and trade environment. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, Australia has been restructuring its economy to be 
less dependent on commodity exports by diversifying into export-oriented 
manufacturing businesses. As part of the change, Australia has cut its 
effective corporate tax rate to 39% from 49% and liberalized some of the work 
practices of unions. 
</P>
<P>
Australia has aggressively hit the road to lure foreign investors from abroad. 
The states of Victoria and Queensland have sent their own investment missions 
abroad, and each has a trade office in Los Angeles. The Victoria Investment 
Program, for example, is targeting the United States, United Kingdom, West 
Germany and Japan as primary sources of potential investment. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the target industries are biotechnology, tourism 
facilities, advanced manufacturing and materials, and medical and scientific 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking business that capitalizes on our strengths," such as cheap 
energy and tax advantages for research and development, Cain said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Major U.S. companies, he said, have discovered Australia as a strategic base 
for Asia-Pacific operations. They include Eastman Kodak Co., B. F. Goodrich 
Co., Campbell Soup Co., Control Data Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. and Philip Morris Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investment Applications 
</P>
<P>
One-third of U.S. investment in Australia is concentrated in Melbourne, which 
is home for 34% of Australia's manufacturing industries and 26% of Australia's 
population. Victoria's rate of growth of non-farm gross domestic product 
averaged 4.6% during the past five years compared to 4.3% for all of Australia 
during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom was the biggest foreign investor in Australia at the end of 
1988, with investments totaling $32.1 billion, followed by the United States 
with $28.6 billion and Japan with $19.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Foreign Investment Review Board reported that in 1987-1988, 
applications for investment from U.S. companies totaled $1.5 billion, divided 
evenly among manufacturing, tourism, minerals and exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Australia is also nurturing business with its Asia-Pacific neighbors. The 
Portland Aluminum Smelter, the largest industrial project with China to date, 
is a partnership involving Alcoa, the state of Victoria, First National Trust 
and China International Trust and Investment Corp. The smelter's first 
production in 1987 brought $583.2 million in export income for Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Australian firms last year completed a light rail system in Hong 
Kong for the Kowloon Canton Railway Corp. worth about $216.4 million.
