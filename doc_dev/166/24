  [Text] Melbourne, June 1 (XINHUA) -- China Trade and 
Investment Forum '94, the largest ever held in Australia, opened 
in Melbourne, the second largest city in Australia, today. 
  The Chinese delegation, consisting of more than 100 
businessmen from China's 20 provinces and cities, was led by Gu 
Yongjiang, vice-minister of China's Ministry for Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation. 
  The Chinese businessmen have brought with them over 500 
projects, valued at 7 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The projects cover the fields of communications, energy, 
Perth- chemical industry, electronic industry, textile industry, 
building materials, agriculture, and service industry. 
  The aim of the forum is to brief the Australian counterpart 
on China's investment environment, its investment policy and 
laws with a view to increasing their understanding of China and 
furthering the development of bilateral economic and trade links. 
  The two-way trade between the two countries stood at 3 
billion U.S. dollars last year, representing an increase of 29 
percent over the previous year, according to China's official 
figures. 
  The forum will last for two days in Melbourne and will then 
be moved to Australia's largest city of Sydney next week.
