   STELCO Inc. (Toronto) -- Robert J. Melbourne was named
president and chief operating officer of the steelmaking
concern. Mr. Melbourne's move into the newly created
positions coincides with Stelco's plan to eliminate its
Stelco Steel and Stelco Enterprises divisions as separate
organizations. The units will be integrated into the parent
company. Mr. Melbourne had been president of Stelco Steel. T.
Raymond Meadowcroft, formerly president of Stelco
Enterprises, will continue as an executive vice president of
the parent with responsibility for its technology-marketing
arm.
