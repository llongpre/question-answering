THE FOUR banks which are majority shareholders in Mirror Group Newspapers
received an assurance on Friday afternoon from Mr David Montgomery, MGN's
chief executive, that the Daily Mirror will remain a left-of-centre
newspaper.
'As a result of conversations which took place last week, I have no doubt
that the Daily Mirror's left-of-centre position will continue,' said Mr John
Melbourn, a senior executive director of National Westminster Bank. Mr
Melbourn added that 'left-of-centre' is synonymous with backing the Labour
Party in general elections. The banks believe a rightward shift would damage
MGN as a business.
Separately it also emerged yesterday that MGN's board is likely to issue a
statement this week, reaffirming both the left-of-centre stance of the Daily
Mirror and stating the board's support for Mr Montgomery's management.
NatWest is MGN's biggest shareholder and Mr Melbourn has been playing a
leading role in attempts by the bank to restore stability to MGN, after its
employees and the Labour Party accused Mr Montgomery of attempting to break
the Mirror's traditional Labour allegiance.
Representatives of National Westminster, Midland, Goldman Sachs and Lloyds,
which between them control 54 per cent of MGN's shares as collateral on
loans to the late Mr Robert Maxwell, saw Mr Montgomery on Friday for a
briefing on the performance of the businesses. A banker at the meeting said:
'After all last week's speculation, we asked him for an assurance that the
newspaper would stay left of centre.' Mr Montgomery gave that assurance.
Earlier in the week, Mr Melbourn sought and received a similar commitment on
the Mirror's political stance from Sir Robert Clarke, MGN's chairman. He
also asked Sir Robert to stay on as chairman for another year, but suggested
that the board should be slightly reconstituted so that non-executives make
up 60 per cent of all directors. One or two other non-executives are
therefore likely to be appointed.
A banks' representative also had a meeting last week with Lord Hollick, the
Labour businessman who is a non-executive director of MGN. The banker asked
Lord Hollick whether he had a hidden agenda as a director of MGN, following
reports that he plans to make a bid for MGN. Lord Hollick told the banks
that he had no hidden agenda and that no bid was planned.
