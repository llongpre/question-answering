Rupert Murdoch's debt-laden News Corp. said today it will merge its four Sydney 
and Melbourne newspapers into two 24-hour publications to avoid shutting down 
its struggling afternoon dailies. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the move, effective Monday, will likely ease pressure on 
News Corp., whose stock price has tumbled about 40% in the last month on 
investor concern about its massive $8.7-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
The merger of Australia's best-selling newspaper, the Melbourne Sun, with the 
city's struggling afternoon broadsheet the Herald, and Sydney's tabloids, the 
morning Daily Telegraph and ailing afternoon Daily Mirror, will mean the loss 
of about 180 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"As an alternative to closing either (afternoon) paper, it will save well over 
800, probably 1,000 jobs as well as giving the public continuing afternoon 
newspaper service," Murdoch said at a news conference in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect the savings to be quite considerable," he said. "I think it is a 
business benefit in that it should improve the overall profit of the company." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch declined to comment either about the recent plunge in News Corp.'s 
stock price, which has wiped about $515 million off its market value, or a 
sharp rise in the group's short-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch said the changes are linked with News' $830-million investment in 
high-technology color printing plants in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and 
Adelaide. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, now an American citizen who spends little time in his native 
Australia, is on an extended visit that will include the company's Oct. 23 
annual meeting in Adelaide. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he welcomes the merger. "It will probably mean a 
loss of jobs for some people, but as far as the community in general is 
concerned, they probably will get a better service," he told reporters in 
Canberra. 
</P>
<P>
The merger of the Melbourne Sun and the Herald will create the Herald-Sun with 
circulation estimated to reach 600,000, he said. Currently, the Herald sells 
175,634 copies a day and the morning Sun 560,444.
