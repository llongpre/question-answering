  [Text] Canberra, May 2 (XINHUA) -- A China trade and 
investment forum will be held in Australia's big cities of 
Melbourne and Sydney early next month in a bid to give a further 
impetus to economic cooperation between the two nations. 
  The forum, initiated by the Chinese Government, will be held 
from June 1-2 in Melbourne and from 7-8 in Sydney and will be 
joined by more than 100 representatives of Chinese industries, 
the largest business delegation ever to visit Australia. 
  The forum was agreed by the two sides last October when Wu 
Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, 
paid a visit to Canberra. 
  The event also follow the Australia-China forum held in 
Beijing organized by Austrade last year. 
  Austrade's East Asia regional office manager Martin Walsh 
said in a release today that the forums will provide a unique 
opportunity for the Chinese Government and business officials to 
outline investment and environment policies for Australian 
business. 
  He said that China continues to be of increasing importance 
to Australian exporters and the forums will offer outstanding 
opportunities for local firms to follow up with key contacts 
from China. 
  "The forums will also give Chinese company executives and 
other decision makers a chance to witness first hand Australian 
technology, industry expertise and capability," he said. 
  The two forums will mainly focus on sectors of building and 
construction, transport and telecommunications, food technology 
and manufacturing. 
  China, the largest buyer of Australia's wool, is the ninth 
largest export market for the South-Pacific country, with a two 
way trade standing at three billion U.S. dollars last year.
