  [Text] Australia has announced the composition of the 
parliamentary delegation which will consult Vietnam on human 
rights. The one-week visit to Vietnam will start on 7 July and 
will be led by the chairman of the parliamentary standing 
committee on foreign affairs, defense, and trade, Stephen 
Loosley. The other two parliamentary members will be the 
opposition spokesman on foreign affairs Andrew Peacock and the 
Australian Democrats foreign affairs spokesman Vicky Vaughan. 
  The consultative delegation to look at human rights and 
other 
issues in the relationship was confirmed during the visit to 
Vietnam last month by Australia's prime minister Paul Keating. 
  Announcing the delegation's makeup, Foreign Minister Gareth 
Evans said it would be accompanied by two academics noted for 
their expertise in Asian affairs and human rights and two 
prominent Vietnamese now living in Australia. 
  The academics are Professor Nancy Viviani, dean of faculty 
of 
the Asian studies at Queensland's Griffith University; and 
Professor Philip Olsten, director of the Center for 
International Law at the Australian National University. 
  Senator Evans said Australia had taken up the suggestion 
from 
the Vietnamese prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, made during his 
visit in May last year that Vietnamese Australians should go 
back to Vietnam to see the situation. 
  The foreign minister said the delegation will include Quang 
Luu, head of radio for the Special Broadcasting Service and Ho 
Mai, a Footscray city councillor in Melbourne. 
  Senator Evans said the delegation was a strong, 
well-balanced 
one that had 
both status and expertise.
