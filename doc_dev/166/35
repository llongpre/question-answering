   Melbourne, Montreal and Seattle-Tacoma are the
best cities in which to live, the private Population Crisis
Committee said after surveying conditions in the world's 100
largest metropolitan areas.
   Lagos, Nigeria, is the worst, the group said Monday in an
analysis based on two years of research.
   Sharon L. Camp, the organization's senior vice president, said
the study wasn't a guidebook for retirement or business or
vacations but rather a warning about the dangers of rapid
population growth.
   ``MOre than half of these cities are sinking from the weight of
too many people,'' she said. ``More than anything else, the numbers
... add up to human population overload.''
   The committee analyzed living conditions in the metropolitan
areas, awarding up to 10 points in each of 10 categories.
   Melbourne, Australia; Montreal, Canada; and the Seattle-Tacoma
area each accumulated 86 of the possible 100 points.
   Lagos scored 19 points.
   Lagos averages 5.8 people per room in living space, only half
the city's houses have water and electricity and there is only one
telephone per 100 people.
   By comparison Melbourne and Montreal average 0.5 person per room
in housing and Seattle-Tacoma has 0.4. All residences in those
cities have water or electricity or both. Seattle-Tacoma has 106
telephones per 100 people, while there are 69 in Montreal and 45 in
Melbourne.
   Joining the three first-place cities in making up the five most
livable cities were Essen-Dortmund-Duisberg, Germany, and the
Atlanta, Ga., area. Both rated 85. The Detroit, Mich.-Windsor,
Ontario region finished sixth.
   With Lagos at the bottom of the list were: Kinshasa, Zaire, 29
points; Dhaka, Bangladesh, 32; and Recife, Brazil, Lima, Peru, and
Kanpur, India, each with 33 points.
   Two of the world's 100 largest cities - Bucharest, Romania, and
Rangoon, Burma - could not be ranked because of lack of data.
   Montreal Mayor Jean Dore said the city, ``like all other major
economic and cultural centers in the world, has to deal with major
social and environmental issues. But our city has an important
advantage over other big cities - Montreal wants to preserve its
heritage of the past while setting human scale development as the
keystone of the future.''
   Steve Morris, president of the Seattle-King County Convention
and Visitors Bureau, said: ``We're always thrilled when Seattle get
high marks in these kind of polls.''
   And Melbourne Mayor Richard Wynne called his community ``one of
the most convenient cities, a comfortable city and a safe city with
good transport and rich cultural activity.''
   Criteria for the rankings were:
   -Murders per 100,000 people: Capetown, South Africa, had the
highest rate at 64.7. Rated at less than one were Madrid, Spain;
Manchester, England; and BAndung, Indonesia.
   -Percent of income spent on food: Most expensive is Ho Chi Minh
City, Vietnam, 80 percent. Residents of 23 communities spend more
than half their income on food. Food accounted for 9 percent of
income in Washington, D.C.
   -People per room: Lagos was most crowded at 5.8, while Canton,
China had 5.7. All cities in the United States, Canada and
Australia as well as Madrid and Birmingham, England, had fewer than
0.5 person per room.
   -Percent of homes with water or electricity or both: At least 70
percent of homes had water and electricity in 87 percent of the
Metro areas, although the analysis didn't always take into account
squatter settlements or illegal water and electrical connections.
Kinshasa, Zaire and Johannesburg, South Africa, had two-thirds of
residents lacking running water or electricity or both.
   -Telephone per 100 people: San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose has
151 telephones per 100 people. Lagos, Ho Chi Minh City and Kinshasa
have less than 1.
   -Percent of children in secondary school: Moscow, Warsaw and
Essen-Dortmund-Duisberg each reported that 100 percent of
youngsters 14 to 17 were attending school. Johannesburg, Lagos and
Lahore, India, had fewer than one-third in school.
   -Infant deaths per 1,000 live births: Taipei, Taiwan, and three
Japanese urban areas (Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto, Tokyo-Yokohama and Nagoya)
had five infant deaths per 1,000 births. Kanpur, India, had 157.
   -Levels of ambient noise: Dallas-Fort Worth, Singapore and
Manchester were ranked as relatively quiet. Noisiest included New
York; London; Karachi, Pakistan; Madras, India; Lahore, Pakistan;
Madrid; Naples; Surabaya, Indonesia; and Monterrey, MExico.
   -Traffic flow in miles per hour in rush hour: Traffic managed
more than 40 mph in Atlanta, Casablanca, Houston, Belo Horizonte,
Brazil, and Detroit-Windsor. In Lima, it crawled along at 4 mph.
   -Air pollution: Taipei, Sydney and Melbourne were ranked as
having clean air. Dirtiest were Calcutta and New Delhi, India;
Jakarta, Indonesia; Tehran, Iran; Beijing and Shenyang, China; and
Milan, Italy.
