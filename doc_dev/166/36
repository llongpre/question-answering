  [Text] Melbourne, June 16 (OANA/ANTARA/REUTERS) - 
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas is in good condition 
after heart bypass surgery in Australia and could leave hospital 
next week, an Indonesian Consulate official said on Thursday. 
  "He's fine. Good condition. Stable. Next Monday or 
Tuesday, he could leave the hospital," Indonesia's Melbourne 
Vice Consul Bambang Tarsanto told REUTERS. 
  Alatas, 61, was admitted to the private Epworth Hospital in 
Melbourne on Sunday and underwent a three-hour quadruple bypass 
operation on Monday after suffering a heart attack last month. 
  Bambang said the foreign minister's departure from hospital 
and return to Indonesia would depend on advice from his surgeon, 
Professor Brian Buxton, the hospital's head of cardiac surgery. 
  But he said he had no idea when Alatas would return to work. 
  Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating visited Alatas on 
Wednesday. 
  Alatas is a key figure in the Nonaligned Movement and in 
preparations for this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation.
