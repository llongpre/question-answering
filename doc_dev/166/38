  [Text] Protests have continued in Jakarta following this 
week's closure of Indonesia's three leading news magazines. 
Michael Maher reports from the Indonesian capital that there 
are signs that the military are not fully behind the Suharto 
government's action. 
  [Maher] About 400 journalists and students, many dressed in 
black, gathered outside the department of information to demand 
the return of press freedom. Riot police tussled with 
demonstrators who spilt out on to the road waving banners 
critical of the government's action. It now appears sections of 
the military are also opposed to the bans on the news weeklies 
TEMPO, DETIK, and EDITOR. The official spokesman of the armed 
forces, Syarwan Hamid, is quoted in the Jakarta newspaper SUARA 
PEMBARUAN as saying that the closures are very regrettable and 
should not have happened. 
  Indonesia's human rights commission has described the bans 
as 
a step backward. However, government officials have since 
issued warnings to at least four other news journals about their 
reporting. Demonstrators say they'll continue their protest 
actions until freedom of expression is restored. 
  [Melbourne Radio Australia in English at 0800 GMT on 23 June 
adds: "The continuing protests come just days ahead of a visit 
to Indonesia by the Australian prime minister, Paul Keating. 
Mr. Keating will meet President Suharto in Jakarta on Tuesday 
[28 June], but it's not clear if the issue of the magazines' 
closure will be raised. A senior Australian official in 
Canberra said that if the media ban is discussed it will be done 
privately and quietly. Graeme Dobell reports. 
  "[Dobell] The senior government official said Mr. Keating's 
meeting with President Suharto would be unscripted and it was 
not possible to say whether the prime minister would raise the 
closure of the three Indonesian magazines. He said the foreign 
minister Gareth Evans had put Australia's position in parliament 
yesterday, when he described the ban as very disappointing. 
That statement had been passed to the Indonesian ambassador and 
Australia's view on freedom of the press had been registered. 
Mr. Keating leaves on Monday afternoon for a 48 hour trip to 
Jakarta to open an Australia-Indonesia business forum."]
