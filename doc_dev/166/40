Visitors to almost any Australian racetrack will be struck by this phenomenon: 
The track's large, comfortable grandstand seating area almost always will be 
deserted. Horseplayers here rarely sit down. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that there is no time to kill between races; indeed, there is no 
time to waste as bettors consult odds on television monitors, compare 
bookmakers' prices and scurry to make wagers. This was the schedule at the 
Warwick Farm races here Tuesday: The first race was run at 12:40. At 12:55 
there was a simulcast from Melbourne. At 1:05 there was a simulcast from 
Brisbane. At 1:10 came a simulcast from Adelaide. Post time for the second live 
race from at Warwick Farm was 1:15. Breathless bettors had the opportunity to 
watch and play 34 races (all with quinella and trifecta wagering) during the 
course of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, citizens in virtually every part of this country had similar 
opportunities, because outlets for the Totalizator Agency Board, the country's 
off-track betting network, are ubiquitous. The TAB is the most efficient, 
extensive off-track betting system in the world. 
</P>
<P>
When technology made such systems possible, racing leaders in virtually every 
country sought the best way to implement it. America's first venture into this 
area was horribly botched by New York City's Off-Track Betting Corp., which 
produced a bloated bureaucracy and wrecked attendance at the tracks. England 
fared even worse, with a system that not only killed attendance but drained 
money from the sport and resulted in pitifully low purses. 
</P>
<P>
Australia did it right. 
</P>
<P>
The scope of illegal, off-track wagering here used to be massive; the 
neighborhood bookie was as much of a fixture in any community as the 
neighborhood cop. While legal, on-track bookmakers were taxed, the illegal 
operators were siphoning potential revenue from the states and the tracks. So 
in 1960 the legislature in the state of Victoria, where Melbourne is located, 
passed a bill creating the TAB to operate off-track betting shops, telephone 
betting and on-course tote betting. It was so successful that each of 
Australia's six states created its own TAB (each with its own management and 
its own betting pools). They revitalized horse racing in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria's TAB was created as a quasi-public authority with two missions: to 
raise money for the state and for the racing industry. The "take" from wagers 
is about 16 percent, of which about 5 percent goes to the tracks. In the past 
year, the TAB handled $1.4 billion in wagers and generated more than $80 
million for purses and track development in this one state alone. "The 
contribution the TAB has made to racing is massively greater than anything the 
tracks could generate themselves," said Victoria TAB General Manager Neil 
Walker. Because of this contribution, a race like the Melbourne Cup could offer 
a $1.6 million purse this year. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the TAB has reduced attendance at the track, a fact of life that 
tracks accept. "We know you can't have your cake and eat it too," said Pat 
Parker, chief executive of the Sydney Turf Club. But the tracks here still 
attract healthy crowds and retain an air of vitality, because on-course 
bookmakers remain legal. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than viewing them as rivals for the betting dollar, TAB and track 
officials know the bookies are an essential part of the game. "They bring 
people to the racecourse," said Parker. "They offer fixed odds and they give 
big players the opportunity to play. And they add a lot of atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the bookies' existence creates business for the tote 
because of arbitrage situations. If one horse is 2 to 1 with the bookmakers and 
5 to 1 on the tote, while the odds on another horse are the reverse, sharpies 
will be betting heavily to exploit the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
But if the arrival of the TAB was a bonanza for tracks and state governments, 
it was also a boon for bettors. When smart handicappers had to do battle with 
the bookies, it was a duel of wise guys vs. wise guys. But now billions of 
dollars of unsophisticated money -- they call it "mug money" here -- were 
flowing into the tote pools. "Our dual betting system makes this the best place 
in the world for a punter (horseplayer)," said Shane Templeton, a journalist 
and professional punter in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Waterhouse, the son of the man who used to be Australia's biggest 
bookmaker, was breaking into the business and was operating one frigid night at 
a little harness track at the foot of the Blue Mountains. In the middle of the 
betting ring was a large drum filled with burning coals where the gamblers 
could huddle to keep warm when they weren't betting. This was, in short, a 
hard-core crowd. One night the tote manager approached Waterhouse and said: 
"We've run out of money. Could you loan us a few thousand dollars?" Waterhouse 
initially wondered if he was being conned, but track officials took him to 
their office and explained that the track always wound up with less money than 
it started with. The on-track wise guys were showing a net profit that was 
being financed by TAB bettors throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Australia would be a wonderful enough place to play the horses just because it 
offers nonstop action, the chance to watch and bet more than 30 races in an 
afternoon. But where else on earth does the game offer the wondrous possibility 
that the crowd could win all of the track's money?
