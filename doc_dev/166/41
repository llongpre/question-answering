   International media mogul Rupert
Murdoch said Wednesday he will merge four of his Australian
newspapers into two around-the-clock productions.
   The head of News Corp. told a news conference that the morning
Melbourne Sun and afternoon Herald would become The Herald-Sun. In
Sydney, the afternoon Mirror and the morning Daily Telegraph will
operate as the Daily Telegraph Mirror. All but the Herald are
tabloids.
   ``These far-reaching changes are made as part of a commercial
decision to consolidate News Ltd.'s competitive positions in both
cities,'' he said.
   The moves come amidst a plunge in the value of News Corp.'s
stock. It was trading Wednesday at the equivalent of $5.56 a share,
$9.42 earlier this month.
   The fall has wiped out more than $1.66 billion of the company's
market capitalization and led the Australian Stock Exchange to
launch an inquiry. News Corp. told the exchange Tuesday it did not
know the reason for the decline.
   The new 24-hour editions, publishing Monday through Saturday,
are expected to start next Monday. While Murdoch said there would
be no cutbacks in editorial staff, other production areas will be
trimmed.
   He said the Sunday Sun and the Sunday Herald in Melbourne would
continue as separate publications.
   The new Sydney paper is projected to have a circulation of
480,000, compared with 600,000 for The Herald Sun.
   Murdoch said the move was one part of News Corp.'s goal to move
to high-tech color printing in Australia, which would see full
color printing on every second page.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he felt the mergers would be
beneficial overall. ``It will probably mean a loss of jobs for some
people, but as far as the community in general is concerned they
probably will get a better service,'' he said.
   Hawke said he did not foresee damage from a reduction in the
divergence of newspaper voices.
   ``If I look at the sort of opinions that come out of the
Telegraph and the Mirror and out of the Sun and the Herald and the
two city papers down there, I don't see an enormous divergence of
opinion,'' he said.
