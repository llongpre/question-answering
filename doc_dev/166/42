Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman who lost a joint bid to develop
the new ADollars 1bn-plus (USDollars 736m) Sydney casino earlier this month,
has raised his underlying interest in Crown Casino, the company currently
developing the rival Melbourne property.
In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr Packer's Consolidated
Press said that a further 16.7m shares had been acquired, raising its
interest, along with that of its associates, from 62.47 per cent to 67.23
per cent. The shares were bought at a price of ADollars 1.49.
Ahead of the latest purchases, which were rumoured to have taken place
earlier this week, ConsPress owned around 22 per cent of Crown, while its
associate, Hudson Conway, owned 26.4 per cent. ConsPress also has an option
over some further shares.
Crown won the right to build the ADollars 750m Melbourne casino last year,
which, when completed, will be one of the world's largest gaming properties
with 200 tables and 2,500 machines.
The casino is being built on the banks of Yarra River, which flows through
the Victorian city.
Mr Packer, who had teamed up with Circus Circus, the large US gaming group,
was the surprise loser in the fight for the even larger Sydney casino
development. His bid was beaten by the Leighton Holdings/Showboat
consortium.
