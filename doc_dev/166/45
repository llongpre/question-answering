Vice President Dan Quayle and Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke reaffirmed 
Wednesday their countries' strong military links but differed on the 
contentious issue of trade. 
</P>
<P>
The two topics dominated 90-minute talks at the start of Quayle's five-day 
visit to Australia on the first leg of an Asian tour. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, arriving here for his first visit to the Pacific region, was welcomed 
with a 19-gun salute on arrival in this country's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle gave Hawke a letter from President Bush that was "warm and personal" but 
did not delve into hard issues, according to a U.S. official. Hawke is 
scheduled to visit the United States in June, and Bush came to Australia in 
1982, when he was vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle described Australia -- the site of joint strategic satellite, shipping 
and communication monitoring posts -- as "a solid and steadfast ally," U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On the thorny issue of trade, Hawke argued for a swift end to the U.S. Export 
Enhancement Program, under which exporters receive a government bonus for 
increased sales. 
</P>
<P>
He said the program, adopted largely to combat European Community subsidies, 
was also affecting Australia's penetration of world markets -- particularly in 
wheat sales -- because it cut prices. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two differed on the issue, Australian officials described the 
atmosphere as "very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
The talks also covered a threat this week by New Zealand Prime Minister David 
Lange to pull out of the ANZUS defense alliance linking his country with 
Australia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has effectively suspended New Zealand from the alliance since 
1985, after Wellington banned visits by ships carrying nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said both sides want New Zealand to remain in ANZUS, but the United 
States will not change its position of wanting its ships to visit New Zealand 
without preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle continues his tour, his second trip overseas since taking office, with 
visits to Melbourne and Sydney before leaving Sunday for Indonesia. He will 
also visit Singapore and Thailand. 
</P>
