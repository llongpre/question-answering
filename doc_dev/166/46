  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Senator Gareth Evans, 
has called on Asia Pacific region countries to put pressure on 
North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program. 
  Speaking at the ninth Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference in 
Sydney, Senator Evans said the situation in North Korea was 
worrying, but not at crisis point. He said a nuclear-armed 
North Korea would undermine confidence in the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and present a serious security 
threat to the region. 
  [Begin Evans recording] For the North Koreans, the choice is 
really a pretty straightforward and simple one -- to remain in 
the NPT and accept the disciplines of the treaty, including full 
IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safeguards, or, 
alternatively, it can continue with its nuclear activities in 
violation of its treaty obligations and face not only almost 
universal international censure, but, in time, a package of 
severe and damaging sanctions. [end recording] 
  The five-day Sydney conference will discuss the latest 
developments in nuclear technology and the region's demand for 
nuclear energy over the next 50 years.
