   Taiwan should halt all contacts with China
until it lifts martial law and acknowledges that the
anti-government demonstrations are patriotic and democratic, 60
legislators said in a statement Monday.
   The lawmakers from the governing Nationalist Party said, ``We
should suspend our policy of opening up toward the mainland until
the Chinese Communists lift martial law and end any military
crackdown.''
   They said they will submit their statement to the Legislative
Yuan (parliament) for discussion Tuesday and then relay it to the
Cabinet.
   Hu Chin-heng, a 35-year-old clerk at the Ministry of
Communications in Taipei, began what he said would be a three-day
hunger strike to protest ``Taiwanese indifference'' to
demonstrators in China who are demanding democratic reforms.
   Students at some universities in Taiwan have signed petitions
supporting the demonstrators in China, but there have been no large
rallies.
   People protesting the Chinese government actions rallied Monday
in the Netherlands and Australia.
   About 150 Chinese students living in Holland staged a peaceful
protest in front of the Chinese Embassy in the Hague.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek advised Dutch
nationals not to travel to China because of the unrest. His warning
followed the weekend cancellation of a planned state visit to China
by Queen Beatrix and her husband Prince Claus.
   Hundreds of Chinese students in Australia held rallies in Sydney
and Melbourne.
   About 300 demonstrators crowded into the courtyard of the
Chinese consulate in Sydney. Some burned photographs of Chinese
Premier Li Peng.
   Police blocked the entrance to the consulate building. There was
no violence.
   A similar rally was held in Melbourne, where demonstrators
called for the removal of Li Peng and China's senior leader, Deng
Xiaping, and the lifting of martial law.
   The Foreign Ministry in Canberra told Australians planning trips
to Beijing to wait until the situation becomes clear.
   The Taiwanese legislators said the Nationalist government should
offer to open direct trade and shipping links with China if China
cancels the crackdown and accepts the protests as patriotic and
democratic.
   The Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 when they lost the civil
war to the Communists. The island's government has refused to have
any direct contacts with the mainland authorities.
   But in the past two years it has followed a flexible policy that
allows Taiwanese and Chinese to exchange visits and trade through
third countries.
   Legislator Huang Chu-wen, who initiated the statement to the
government, said a military crackdown could set back democracy in
China by 20 years and ``we would miss a good opportunity to reunite
peacefully.''
   The Nationalists say China and Taiwan, considered a Chinese
province by both the Nationalists and Communists, should be
reunited under a democratic system. Martial law was lifted in
Taiwan in 1987 after it had been in force for 38 years.
