   George Herscu, one of Australia's
richest men until his Hooker Corp. fell on hard times, was
convicted Thursday on corruption charges.
   The 62-year-old Romania native was found guilty of paying
$77,000 in 1983 to a Queensland state cabinet minister to try to
ease access restrictions to a failing shopping center.
   Herscu had pleaded not guilty to two charges of official
corruption. He claimed he made the two $28,500 payments to Russ
Hinze, who at the time was a state minister for roads, to buy him
two racehorses.
   The now-bankrupt Herscu appeared unmoved as the Brisbane
District Court jury delivered its verdict at the end of a four-week
trial. Sentencing was scheduled for Friday.
   A Romanian Jew, Herscu worked in Nazi labor camps during World
War II until being liberated by the Soviet Army in 1944. He moved
to Australia in 1950.
   As a 25-year-old in 1953, Herscu bought one small grocery store
then others, including one at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. In 1959,
he went into property development.
   In 1986, Herscu took over Hooker Corp., Australia's premier
property developer with substantial U.S. interests. He took out
loans and spent $1 billion, in part on up-market American
retailers, including Bonwit Teller.
   The U.S. subsidiary, L.J. Hooker Corp., has disposed of the bulk
of its retail holdings acquired since 1986, including Bonwit Teller
and other department store chains.
   After being steered into shopping-center developments in the
United States, Hooker grounded on a $1.5 billion debt in July 1989.
Both Hooker and Herscu's personal company, Hersfield Developments
Corp., went into liquidation.
   In July, Herscu and his wife, Sheila, declared themselves
bankrupt. The move came two days before a bankruptcy claim made
against them was to be heard in a Melbourne court.
   Documents filed with the court showed Herscu had total debts of
more than $382 million and assets of only $1.5 million.
   Once among the social elite of Melbourne, Herscu was forced to
move out of his Toorak mansion, an extravagant home that was based
on ``Tara'' from the movie ``Gone With The Wind.''
