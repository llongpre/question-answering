FT  09 FEB 94 / People: Melbourn promoted at NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A chain of moves in the top management of National Westminster Bank was
disclosed yesterday, led by the appointment of John Melbourn, the bank's
head of group risk, to succeed Bert Morris as the bank's deputy chief
executive.
The reshuffle is one of the most significant changes to the bank's senior
roster since Derek Wanless was appointed chief executive in 1992. The
changes, which all involve bank insiders, will take place from March 1.
Melbourn, a 56-year-old who was thought to be a contender for the chief
executive's job when Derek Wanless was appointed, is one of the bank's most
experienced hands, having headed international operations and its
relationships with large companies.
Wanless says that Melbourn is 'a tremendous banker' who would bring a wide
range of experience to the post. Melbourn will work alongside Morris until
September, when the latter is due to retire.
Melbourn will retain board responsibility for credit risk, and the handling
of large corporate restructurings. But his current deputy, Fred Pointon, has
been appointed to the post of general manager of group risk in his place.
A second significant change announced yesterday is the appointment of Phil
Wise, the current chief executive of group services, as chief operating
officer at NatWest Markets, the bank's corporate and investment banking arm.
Wise, 45, has worked with Martin Owen, the chief executive of NatWest
Markets, before when the men brought together the bank's treasury
operations.
Like other securities houses, NatWest Markets had a good year amid buoyant
bond and equity markets. Wanless has signalled that the bank is considering
ways of building on its investment banking business to help raise revenues.
NatWest Markets' two senior managing directors, Roger Byatt and John
Howland-Jackson, have been appointed deputy chief executives. Wise will be
succeeded at group services by Trevor Blackler, general manager of UK branch
business. Stuart Chandler, general manager for human resources and strategic
development, has been appointed to the new post of deputy chief executive
for UK branch business with responsibility for technology and human
resources.
