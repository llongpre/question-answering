BANK of Melbourne yesterday released details of its previously-announced
one-for-four rights issue, Reuter reports from Melbourne.
The bank plans to raise ADollars 71.8m (USDollars 55.2m) after expenses to
build up its retail business and boost capital, by issuing 20.94m shares at
ADollars 3.50 each.
'The proceeds of the issue will be used in the bank's retail banking
business and will provide additional capital to keep pace with the asset
growth which the bank is achieving,' it said.
The bank recently reported net losses of ADollars 21.1m for the first half
to December, compared with profits of ADollars 13.12m a year earlier.
