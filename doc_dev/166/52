The fallout from the break-up of Yugoslavia is having some strange effects
in distant parts of the world. The Australian Soccer Federation, eager to
stamp out occasional outbreaks of thuggery among spectators, has ordered
clubs to drop their ethnic names, ignoring impassioned pleas for a reprieve.
The league says the ruling has provoked 'a lot of emotion' among the clubs,
many of which rely on support from specific ethnic minorities to pay the
bills. The affected clubs include Sydney and Melbourne Croatia, South
Melbourne Hellas, and Preston Makedonia.
The league has yet to decide whether Parramatta Melita Eagles derived its
name from the Maltese community which provides its main support. However,
Sydney Marconi will be allowed to keep its name, in spite of its Italian
overtones. The league says the club was named after the inventor.
