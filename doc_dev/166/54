   SYDNEY, Australia -- Compass Airlines, Australia's newest
domestic carrier, collapsed when negotiations broke down over
a last-ditch financial rescue package.
   Compass, led by long-time airline executive Bryan Grey,
began operations Dec. 1, 1990, two months after Australia's
skies were deregulated. Since then, Compass has engaged in
fierce fare wars with the two established domestic carriers,
Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines, that saw some fares
drop by as much as 80%.

   Late Friday, Compass's directors asked for Ian Ferrier, a
senior partner with chartered accountants Ferrier Hodgson, to
be appointed as provisional liquidator. The airline's flights
were grounded throughout the country and the government asked
Ansett, Australian and international carrier Qantas Airways
to honor thousands of Compass bookings.
   In Melbourne, the Compass share register shows that Mr.
Grey sold 80% of his holdings in the airline during the past
six months. The register at Melbourne chartered accountants
Price Waterhouse shows that the stake held by Mr. Grey's
private company, Keymaze Pty., shrunk to two million shares,
or just 1.5% of Compass's shares outstanding.
