   John Fairfax Ltd.'s takeover bid for all of Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd. appears to be aimed at acquiring several of the Australian media group's newspapers, analysts said. 

   The bid, equivalent to $1.65 billion, tops one by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for $1.52 billion. 
The latter offer seemed likely to succeed before Fairfax's announcement yesterday; only last week, News Corp. had reached agreement for another competing Herald bidder, Robert Holmes a Court, to drop his offer in return for certain Herald assets. 

   News Corp. already owns about 52% of Herald's shares, but these shares apparently haven't been registered in News Corp.'s name. 

   Ownership of Melbourne-based Herald would give Mr. Murdoch control of more than half the Australian newspaper market. 
News Corp. already publishes major newspapers in Australia, the U.S. and Britain, and has broadcasting and entertainment interests. 

   Fairfax, primarily a newspaper publisher, made its offer at the same time as it began legal action meant to prevent Herald from registering News Corp. acceptances. 
Analysts said the move appears to be aimed at forcing News Corp. to negotiate with Fairfax over Herald's newspaper assets. 
The Australian market seemed to support that view, as Herald shares fell short of the $10.57 offered by Fairfax, to close at $10.14, up from the previous day's $9.65. 
The News Corp. bid is for $9.91 a share. 
The all-cash offer by Fairfax also is conditioned on its obtaining 50.1% of Herald's shares. 

   In New York, a spokeswoman for Mr. Murdoch said he couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Fairfax had surfaced in the takeover fight earlier this month when it bid for Queensland Press Ltd., which was Herald's single largest holder with a 24% stake. 
Fairfax had planned then to divest a large part of Herald if its bid succeeded. 
Analysts said Fairfax's earlier bid showed its current interest is in acquiring several newspaper properties, which would add significantly to its classified advertising lineage in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age. 

   The original Fairfax bid for Queensland was conditioned on Mr. Holmes a Court's succeeding in his offer for Herald, which held 48% of Queensland. 
Mr. Holmes a Court, in turn, owned 14% of Queensland. 
Fairfax dropped its offer after Mr. Holmes a Court's agreement with Mr. Murdoch. 

   Under that agreement, Mr. Holmes a Court said he would end his $1.38 billion offer for Herald and all legal proceedings against Mr. Murdoch in return for a newspaper and television station valued at a total of $295.6 million. 

   The challenge by Fairfax, launched in the supreme court of Victoria, appears to center on an Australian law that prohibits foreign citizens from owning more than 15% of a television station. 
Herald owns stations in Melbourne and Adelaide; Mr. Murdoch is a U.S. citizen. 

   Although News Corp. has set up a special plan to conform to the ownership rule, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal received court clearance yesterday to review the plan, and could rule the Herald bid structure illegal despite News Corp.'s intention to divest Herald's broadcasting operations, analysts said.
