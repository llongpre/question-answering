  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans has written 
to the federal Labor [Party] caucus strongly defending the 
government's decision to recognize the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia [FYROM]. The move has drawn threats of a political 
backlash from Australia's large Greek community which objects to 
the use of the name, Macedonia, also the name of a Greek 
province. 
  A protest rally by the Greek community in Melbourne 
yesterday 
attracted a crowd of about 60,000. Senior Liberal Party figures 
joined the rally, condemning the government's recognition of the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- speeches described by 
Senator Evans as the worst kind of dangerous political 
opportunism. 
  Sen. Evans has told his caucus colleagues the government 
will 
always conduct Australia's foreign policy to advance and protect 
Australia's national interests. He also told them the 
government will govern for all Australians, not just those who 
shout or threaten the lives, he said.
