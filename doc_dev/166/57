   Rupert Murdoch's NEWS CORP., which sold its television interests in Australia just two weeks ago so it could take over the country's biggest media company, is returning to the television business there. 

   Transactions announced yesterday would give News Corp. a 15% holding in television stations in Sydney and Melbourne -- the country's two biggest cities -- and in the smaller cities of Lismore and Coffs Harbor. 

   Earlier this month, News Corp. sold its television stations in Melbourne and Sydney, plus some small newspapers, radio stations and a recording concern, to Westfield Capital Corp. for the equivalent of $561.3 million. 
Westfield, in turn, plans to sell the media interests to a company controlled by its Northern Star Holdings Ltd. 

   Northern Star plans to put its current television operations in Lismore and Coffs Harbor into this unit, keep a 75% stake, and sell 15% of the unit to News Corp. for an undisclosed sum. 

   News Corp. said its Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. unit will "enjoy a close association" with Northern Star's television company. 

   In order to buy Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd. earlier this month, Mr. Murdoch was forced to sell his television stations in Australia because foreigners aren't allowed to own more than 15% of an Australian television station. 
Herald, Australia's biggest media group, owned television and radio stations, as well as newspapers and magazines.
