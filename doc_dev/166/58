   John Fairfax Ltd., attempting to establish a second television network in Australia, offered the equivalent of $239.8 million for the television interests of Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd. 

   Last month, Bond Corp. paid $666.1 million for the television operations of privately owned Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd., making it the first company to set up a network covering most major Australian cities. 

   Fairfax's offer is the second it has made to Herald, which is Australia's biggest media company, with interests in newspapers, magazines, television and radio. 
Fairfax earlier offered $1.67 billion for all of Herald, in competition with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which is offering $1.53 billion. 
News Corp. has made provisional agreements to sell Herald's television stations if its bid succeeds. 

   The separate Fairfax offer for the Herald television stations was viewed by analysts as an attempt by Fairfax to ensure that it comes out of the battle with at least some of Herald's assets. 

   The moves have been sparked in part by a proposed liberalization in government regulations that up to now have restricted a single company from owning more than two television stations. 
The government proposes instead to limit the ability of companies to own both newspaper and television operations in any major city. 
The proposals haven't been approved by parliament and might be changed before they become law. 

   Fairfax, which already owns television stations in Sydney and Brisbane as well as newspapers and magazines in several states, said it is prepared to pay $179.8 million for Herald's Melbourne television station and $59.9 million for its Adelaide station. 
As an alternative to the offer for the Adelaide station, Fairfax said it would pay $76.6 million for that station plus Herald radio operations in the states of Victoria and South Australia. 

   Herald's chairman, John Dahlsen, said after the Fairfax offer was received that the Herald board decided to call for tenders for its radio and television operations, and that an additional offer from a company he didn't identify already had been received for the Melbourne station. 

   Fairfax's group general manager, G.J. Gardiner, said the company would be prepared to reconsider its offers for the television operations if other companies make higher bids.
