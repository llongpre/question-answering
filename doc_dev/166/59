  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, has 
released a statement on his efforts to help an Australian 
citizen detained without charge by China. Senator Evans said 
Australia had been assiduous in its efforts on behalf of James 
Pang who has been held in Shenzhen detention center since 
October because of corruption allegations. 
  Senator Evans, who released the 33-point chronology listing 
Australia's actions on behalf of Mr. Pang since October, 
expressed surprise at Australia's commitment to the case has 
been criticized in a Melbourne newspaper report. 
  He also released a copy of the letter that he had written to 
Mr. Pang's wife in Hong Kong last Friday, saying that Australia 
was taking the case very seriously. He has raised the issue of 
the Australian citizen being detained without charge with 
China's foreign minister, Qian Qichen, with Guangdong vice 
governor, Lu Ruihua, and with the first vice chairman of China's 
National People's Congress, Tian Jiyun.
