  [Text] Sydney, June 7 (XINHUA) -- The second stage of the 
China trade and investment forum was held in Australia's largest 
city of Sydney today with a view to attracting more Australian 
investors to China. 
  The first phase of the forum was held in Melbourne early 
this 
month, with the presence of Chinese Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang 
of foreign trade and economic cooperation and Australian Trade 
Minister Bob McMullan. 
  Officials said that during the two-day forum held in 
Melbourne, 147 letters of intent had been signed, which 
indicated a great interest the Aussie businessmen have shown in 
the forum. 
  The 147 letters of intent covered mainly on power stations, 
railway technology and petrochemicals. 
  The purpose of the forum, the largest ever held in 
Australia, 
is to brief the Australian business on China's investment 
environment, its investment policy and laws. 
  It also aimed at increasing their understanding of China and 
furthering the development of bilateral economic and trade links. 
  More than 100 businessmen from China's 20 provinces and 
cities attended the forum and have brought with them over 500 
projects, valued at seven billion U.S. dollars. 
  The projects cover the fields of communications, energy, 
petro- chemical industry, electronic industry, textile industry, 
building materials, agriculture, and service industry. 
  China and Australia enjoyed a two-way trade of three billion 
U.S. dollars last year, representing an increase of 29 percent 
over the previous year, according to China's official figures. 
  More than 200 Australian company representatives 
participated 
in the forum held in Sydney today.
