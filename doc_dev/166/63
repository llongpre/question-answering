<TEXT>
   Grumman said it will build a 100,000-square-foot hangar in
Florida for installation and integration of the Joint Stars
radar system into aircraft. The company is also negotiating
with the Louisiana Department of Economic Development to
lease a large aviation facility for aircraft modification at
the Chennault Industrial Airpark in Lake Charles. Boeing 707
aircraft would be refurbished and modified for Joint Stars at
this facility before being flown to Melbourne.
   Joint Stars is a battle management system being developed
for the Air Force and Army that is designed to detect,
locate, track and classify enemy formations at long range,
and guide aircraft and missiles against them.
