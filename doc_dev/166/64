   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov
came down with a fever and cold Wednesday and postponed the signing
of several bilateral fishing and trade agreements, a spokesman said.
   The Soviet spokesman said the signings would be held Thursday.
   Ryzhkov, the highest-ranking Kremlin official ever to visit
Australia, is on the second day of a three-day trip as part of a
Pacific tour aimed at forging closer economic ties.
   He arrived Tuesday in Melbourne from Bangkok, Thailand, and was
greeted by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Foreign Minister Gareth
Evans. He flew to Canberra on Wednesday morning.
   Ryzhkov, the main architect of Soviet economic reform, is
scheduled to sign agreements on matters including port access for
Soviet fishing trawlers and consular guarantees and commodities
deals.
   He spent Tuesday inspecting the distribution center for the
Australian-owned Safeway supermarket chain and later officially
opened a Center for Soviet and East European Studies at the
University of Melbourne.
   Vadim P. Perfiliev, deputy chief of the Soviet Foreign Ministry
Information Department, said the computerized distribution and
management at the 47-acre supermarket complex could be useful in
the Soviet Union.
   Shortages of food and inefficient distribution are two of the
Soviet government's most pressing problems.
   At a dinner given by Premier John Cain of Victoria state,
Ryzhkov said the Communist Party's historic decision to give up its
monopoly on power is only one of many political reforms and
economic changes to come in his nation.
   ``Despite the difficulties, we are determined to continue along
the road we have mapped out,'' he said.
   He said reforms now under way were the most radical ever carried
out to ``democratize the whole of our society and develop a new
federalism in my country.''
   Ryzhkov also said the Soviets want ``to find a radical solution
to the disarmament problem, to remove the threat of a nuclear war
and resolve grave regional conflicts.''
   Ryzhkov and his party are to visit Sydney, Australia's largest
city and a major Pacific financial center, on Thursday and travel
to Singapore, his last stop, on Friday.
