Why should an Irish horse-trainer be standing in a bar in Melbourne reciting
verses from A Bush Christening? Answer: it was Dermot Weld's damage-
limitation exercise in the wake of Vintage Crop winning the Melbourne Cup,
an Irish victory for the first time in the cup's history.
Vintage Crop, a 14-1 outsider, trained by Weld at The Curragh and owned by
Michael Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging impresario, won by three
lengths. To add insult to Australia's injury, Smurfit, who now lives in
Monte Carlo, was not even in Melbourne to collect the ADollars 2m winnings,
though his son and other members of the family were present.
Still, trainer Weld, who had obviously kissed the Blarney stone, impressed
his audience with his enthusiasm for Australia - begun as a child when he
was given a book of Banjo Paterson's verses, including The Man From Snowy
River. Meanwhile, in time-honoured tradition, business life ground to a halt
as all eyes turned to the finishing line. Who knows if it was the Irish
victory, but the stock market closed lower for the first time in a week.
