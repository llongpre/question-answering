lease' clause to placate opponents will help make Australian privatisation a
flyer

Australia's Labor government yesterday approved plans to sell the 22
airports owned by the Federal Airports Corporation to the private sector, a
deal which could net ADollars 2bn (Pounds 900m) for the Treasury.
But the decision was taken only after an important concession to the left
wing of the party, which is opposed to privatisation. The airports will be
sold on a 'long lease', rather than a freehold basis, and the state will
continue to own the commonwealth land on which they are sited.
Even so, it still has to steer the proposal through its annual party
conference in Hobart next week. What shape the airports sale takes, and what
markers are set down for future privatisation policy, will be
keenly-debated.
The government of prime minister Mr Paul Keating is also hoping to sell off
a 75 per cent stake in Qantas, the national airline, an 80.6 per cent stake
in the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), an investment and
project finance group, and a handful of smaller assets.
The plans were outlined in the budget in May, and expenditure plans depend
on proceeds of ADollars 2.45bn during 1994-95. They are intended to follow
privatisation receipts of more than ADollars 5bnsince the late 1980s.
Labor party policy justifies public ownership because it makes 'essential
services . . . available at affordable prices to all Australians'. It also
requires that any privatisation proposal be scrutinised to ensure that it
does not 'weaken the sense of national identity' associated with the
business in question, or 'concentrate power in the hands of narrow private
interests'.
A new policy is being proposed for the conference. It refers to 'improving
the provision of community services through the public sector,
non-government community organisations and the private sector as
appropriate' and ensuring that any sale has a net benefit to the community.
Already, opponents have organised anti-privatisation rallies in cities
across Australia in recent weeks.
The Qantas sale has been accepted as a fait accompli, and is planned to go
ahead in the first half of 1995. A 25 per cent stake in the airline has
already been sold to British Airways and - from a management and financial
perspective - the company has been gearing up for a stockmarket share sale.
Earlier this week, it reported improved earnings results for 1993-94. The
only rumblings on the Qantas front centre on the scale of the employee share
ownership scheme required as part of the sale.
But the nation's airports are much more contentious. There are 22 separate
properties, ranging from Sydney's Kingsford Smith, which handles 16m
passengers a year, to Bankstown, with annual passenger throughput of 7,500.
The FAC was formed in 1988, to make national airport strategy more coherent
and less susceptible to political whim. It is profitable and, given the
potential growth in Australia's tourism industry with the Olympics Games in
Sydney in 2000, there is thought to be a lot of buyer interest. Britain's
BAA has already been mentioned.
While the larger airports, such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, are
profitable, many of the smaller ones are not. Independent studies are
thought to advise that the maximum proceeds would be raised by selling the
assets as a single block. The FAC, which has said little publicly, is also
thought to prefer the option of remaining one entity - in part because of
the economies of scale this allows.
From a political perspective, however, clustering the properties might be a
more viable proposition, since this would offer more opportunities for local
or state-based investors to be involved. This approach might also have the
advantage of appearing 'pro-competitive', the argument being that different
groups of regional airports might then vie for business.
While wrangling continues over the particulars of the airport sale, the
bigger question is how much further a Labor government will be able to push
Australia's privatisation programme.
The biggest potential candidate is Telstra, the government-owned
telecommunications group. While privatisation gossip about Telstra surfaces
periodically, as does talk that outside investors might be introduced on a
joint venture basis in certain areas, ministers have indicated that it will
not be sold in the current term of office.
