  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, says the 
closure of three news magazines by the Indonesian Government is 
an internal matter for Indonesia. But Mr. Keating's office in 
Canberra said Australia was a strong supporter of freedom of the 
press which was regarded as a basic right. A spokesman said Mr. 
Keating would go ahead with his planned trip to Jakarta despite 
a call by a leading Indonesian human rights lawyer to cancel the 
trip following the banning of the magazines by the government of 
President Suharto. Michael Marr reports from Jakarta. 
  [Begin Marr recording] The head of Indonesia's Legal Aid 
Institute, Adnan Buyung Nasution, has urged Mr. Keating to 
cancel his trip to Jakarta which is scheduled for next week to 
protest against the closure of the three news weeklies. The 
leading human rights lawyer has also called on U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to call off his planned visit to Indonesia due to 
take place during the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum's leaders 
summit later this year. The government has yet to fully reveal 
why it banned TEMPO, the country's leading news magazine, and 
the popular publications DETIK and EDITOR. However, all three 
magazines have recently published articles critical of the 
country's research and technology minister, Dr. Yusuf Habibie, 
who is a confidant of President Suharto. Pro-democracy 
activists have been quick to declare the closure of the 
publications as a major setback to openness in Indonesia. So 
far, authorities have yet to say whether or not the bans will be 
permanent. [end recording]
