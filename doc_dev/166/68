commercial market

Wander through the heart of Sydney's business district, and you will notice
an elegant, refurbished deco property, known as the Grace Building.
Encompassing some 21,500 square metres of empty office space, it was sold by
Japan's Shimizu corporation to the Malaysian Low Yat group for ADollars
16.5m (Pounds 7.8m) earlier this year.
Given that the Japanese had bought the property for more than twice this
amount, the sale would not seem to be the brightest harbinger for the
Australian property market. Yet the fact that it took place at all, and that
properties are finally changing hands, is interpreted as a healthy
development.
Agents and investors generally agree that the commercial property market,
which collapsed in 1989, turned a corner in the latter half of 1993.
Initially, they say, there was a marked 'bounce-back' in values, followed by
a more recent period of consolidation. What happens next, says a senior
property manager with one of the country's largest institutions, will depend
upon the pace and sustainability of the current economic upturn.
'What had occurred in the commercial property market was an overreaction,'
he says. 'There's been a significant spring in values over the past 12
months. Now it's a question of waiting for the fundamentals, such as an
expansion of tenants, to gather strength.'
The peaking-out of the commercial property market in 1989 came at the end of
a 19-year cycle, and was triggered by a combination of debt-financed,
speculative overbuilding and crumbling demand as the business sector
contracted and the economy went into recession.
The result was predictable. Vacancy rates soared in the early 1990s as a
backlog of newly-built offices emerged in the main urban centres - Sydney,
Melbourne, Perth and, to a lesser extent, Brisbane. In Melbourne alone
available office space increased by almost 40 per cent between 1990 and
1994, a net addition of about 900,000 sq m. Almost half of this increase was
accounted for by new 'landmark' towers, according to Graham Strachan,
research director at Richard Ellis, surveyors.
The result was a buyers' market. Efforts to woo tenants intensified, and
incentives ate up an increasing proportion of the face-value of new lease
agreements.
The number of commercial property transactions, meanwhile, nose-dived as
institutional investors wound down their property portfolio weightings and
big foreign investors, such as the Japanese, retrenched. In broad terms,
institutional exposure to property halved between early 1988 and 1993,
reaching 6-7 per cent of total portfolio weightings by the end of that year.
Many of the market's problems have been little different to those of the US
or UK sectors, which both experienced bruising property downturns in the
late 1980s. However, the Australian market's turning-point came somewhat
later, perhaps six months behind that of Britain's in early 1993. Some
Sydney residents think that the decision to award the 2000 Olympics Games to
their city, announced in late-September last year, marked the start of the
upturn - although they admit that the effect was primarily on sentiment. The
net impact of the Games on construction activity nationwide was put at only
ADollars 373m, while peak demand for extra office space was estimated at
75,000 sq m, or less than 2 per cent of Sydney's current 'central business
district' market.
What has occured since the end of 1993 is a selective recovery. In terms of
rental demand, most of the leading cities have seen a flurry of activity at
the top end of the office market. According to Philip Lees, associate
director at Knight Frank Hooker, office vacancies in Sydney topped out at
23-24 per cent in the first quarter of this year and are now 'rapidly
diminishing' for prime or A-grade properties.
Much of this, he admits, is due to tenants trading into more favourable
locations. The use of incentives to woo new clients is still widespread but
has at least fallen from a peak of 45 per cent of the face-value of the
lease. Rent reviews, he says, are now being introduced from year six of an
agreement.
In Melbourne, Mr Strachan of Richard Ellis sees a similar situation, but
stresses that it is only the top end of the market which is benefiting.
Vacancy rates in the 'top 20' business locations have fallen from about 30
per cent in 1991, to about 11 per cent at present. But this improvement has
been at the expense of second-grade properties. The vacancy rate overall is
still about 24 per cent.
One outcome of these still-patchy conditions has been the much-publicised
trend towards converting commercial properties to residential use - with the
end-result usually billed to home-buyers as trendy 'Manhattan-style',
warehouse living. But at least some property companies think the vogue may
have attracted more attention than it deserves.
'These conversions happened because of the poor state of the office market,
and were led by developers not customers,' says one agent. 'The banks are
now more stringent, and demanding that 80 per cent of units are pre-sold.
The market is correcting itself.'
On the sales side, meanwhile, the feeling among agents and investors that
the commercial property market has passed its nadir is growing, and that
there is evidence that buyers are returning. This is partly a domestic
trend: several institutions - such as the National Mutual, the Australian
Mutual Provident and Bankers Trust Australia - are thought to be back in the
market, and fund managers privately confirm this.
More marked, however, is the overseas interest. South-east Asian investors -
notably from Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong - have been prominent, seeing
Australia, with its stable political system, as a 'safe haven'. Some agents
report that these investors tend to prefer good, second-tier properties, and
have thus helped to underpin the lower end of the market.
The increase in buyer interest, meanwhile, has allowed some Japanese
investors to liquidate holdings - a process which is still continuing. This
week, for example, the Park Grand hotel, in central Sydney, was sold for an
undisclosed sum, thought to be in excess of ADollars 300m, by Kajima
Properties, which had placed the property in receivership in February. In
this instance, the buyer was American - ITT Sheraton, the hotels group.
