BANK OF Melbourne, one of Australia's newest licensed banks, plunged into
the red in the December half, reflecting its exposure to the
Occidental/Regal life insurance crash, writes Bruce Jacques in Melbourne.
The bank yesterday disclosed it had suffered a loss of ADollars 21.1m
(USDollars 15.5m) in the half, against a ADollars 13.1m profit last time.
The loss followed a ADollars 65m pay-out to the judicial manager of the two
life companies after the bank settled a prolonged legal action.
