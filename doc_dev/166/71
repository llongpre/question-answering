   Australian journalist Sam White, the Paris
correspondent for London's Evening Standard newspaper for more than
40 years, has died in the French capital at age 77.
   Linda White, his daughter-in-law, said the journalist died
Sunday in a clinic where he was receiving treatment for respiratory
problems.
   White continued his weekly column until shortly before his death.
   During World War II, White reported for Australia's Sydney Daily
Telegraph. He covered in the 1944 invasion of Normandy and entered
Paris with the U.S. Army.
   After the war, White returned to Austrialia briefly but soon
came back to Europe. He began working for the Evening Standard in
1947.
   In Paris, he became a familiar sight in the Crillon bar, where
he had his own telephone, and visiting journalists were often taken
there to be introduced to him. Later, the Travelers' Club became
his base.
   Despite his inability to master the French language, White had
an extraordinary range of contacts in France and regaled his
readers with a column of gossip about society, the arts and the
underworld, combined with shrewd analysis of French politics.
   He also wrote for the British weekly Spectator and visited
London occasionally to watch cricket at Lord's.
   White was born in Kiev in the Ukraine, from which his family
fled during the Bolshevik Revolution to Australia, settling in
Melbourne. He was educated at Melbourne University and joined the
Australian Communist Party, but was expelled for ``bourgeois
bohemianism.'' He came to Britain at the end of the 1930s.
   White had two sons by his first marriage and a daughter by his
second.
