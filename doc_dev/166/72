  [Text] Jakarta, May 10 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The Foreign 
Ministry said on Friday that Foreign Minister Ali Alatas' 
condition has improved but he will undergo further treatment in 
Melbourne, Australia. 
  Through a statement, the Foreign Ministry said, Alatas had 
been doing some work from his bed since he was admitted to the 
Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU) of a Jakarta private hospital 
more than two weeks ago. 
  The minister is very much concerned with a rash of 
speculation on his health and has expressed his desire to meet 
with the mass media, it said. 
  "However the medical team attending him advised that he 
takes 
a complete rest," it said. 
  Alatas, 61, a key figure in the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) 
and 
in preparations for this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC), was admitted to a Jakarta hospital 
on May 25 after complaining of stomach aches playing golf. 
  Officials said he had suffered a mild heart attack. 
  The Foreign Ministry also said Alatas will undergo further 
medical tests in Melbourne to look into the possibility he may 
have sclerosis. 
  Sources close to the Foreign Ministry said Alatas who is 
widely known as a hard-working chain smoker will leave for 
Melbourne either later on Friday or Saturday.
