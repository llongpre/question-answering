  [Text] Hundreds of thousands of people are reportedly 
being forced to attend mass rallies throughout Burma organized 
by the country's military junta. Critics say the rallies, which 
have been held in the name of the junta's new political front, 
the Union Solidarity and Development Association [USDA], are 
being manipulated by the regime to legitimize its control on 
politics. The report coincides with news that the second 
biggest rebel army is due in the capital, Rangoon, next month to 
sign a cease-fire agreement with the military government. 
  Evan Williams says the deal was to end 30 years of 
insurgency 
by Kachin fighters in Burma's far north. 
  [Begin Williams recording] Kachin mediators in the state 
capital say the delegation is due in Rangoon to ratify a 
cease-fire reached late last year. It is an important 
psychological victory for the junta on the brink of similar 
talks with all other major ethnic insurgent groups and it will 
be held up to a critical world as progress toward peace in 
Burma. Ethnic groups have been promised a role in drafting the 
new constitution and some economic and legislative autonomy, but 
both sides remain armed and critics warn the constitution is 
already being dominated by the junta's aim to retain power.
