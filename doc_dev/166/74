  [Text] Australia's deputy prime minister, Brian Howe, says 
China's Premier Li Peng has indicated China wants more 
information from the International Atomic Energy Agency about 
North Korea's nuclear program. Ali Moore reports on Mr. Howe's 
meeting with Mr. Li: 
  [Moore] In his official talks with Chinese leaders in 
Beijing, Brian Howe says he got no indication from the Chinese 
of support for sanctions against North Korea. However, Premier 
Li Peng did suggest China would like more information. 
  [Begin Howe recording] I think if there is a main point that 
was made by the premier it was that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency might assist by providing China with more 
information on the basis of which it could make (?perhaps a 
firmer judgment). [end recording]
