A DISPUTE has broken out between the Maxwell empire's beleaguered pension
funds and National Westminster Bank over the ownership of shares worth
Pounds 28m in Teva Pharmaceutical, an Israeli concern.
NatWest said yesterday that it had not made a decision on whether to keep
the shares, in which the Maxwell pension funds claim an interest. Lord
Alexander, NatWest's chairman, confirmed that the bank had been approached
by Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, the provisional liquidator
of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which acted as both manager and
trustee of the Maxwell pension funds.
Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, said the bank had been given no
conclusive evidence that the shares were the property of the pension funds.
He said the bank had been given the shares as security against a modest loan
to the Maxwell private companies shortly after Mr Robert Maxwell died last
November.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Robert Maxwell's son, had pledged the shares to
NatWest. 'We took them in good faith', said Mr Melbourn. 'We cannot simply
give them back without investigating the pension funds' claim. What would
our shareholders say if we did?'
