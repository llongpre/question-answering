ONE of Australia's most senior bankers, Mr Will Bailey, is to retire as
deputy chairman and group chief executive of the Melbourne-based ANZ Bank.
His retirement heads a 'changing of the guard' at ANZ, also involving the
retirement of the bank's chairman, Mr Milton Bridgland, who will leave the
board in June on reaching retirement age.
The bank announced the changes yesterday, saying Mr Bailey would retire in
the December quarter of this year and his successor would be announced in a
few months.
But some clues on the succession were given with the appointment of two new
executive directors, the bank's New Zealand chief executive, Mr Alister
Maitland, and the chief general manager of Australian retailing operations,
Mr Don Mercer.
Mr Bridgland will be replaced as chairman by ANZ director Mr John Gough, who
is also chairman of Pacific Dunlop, the Melbourne industrial conglomerate.
The changes end an era of growth at ANZ since Mr Bailey became chief
executive in 1984. This included integration of the UK-based Grindlays
banking group and New Zealand's Postbank.
Mr Bailey also presided over the takeovers of the National Mutual Royal Bank
and the Town and Country Bank. His tenure saw ANZ group assets jump to
ADollars 98bn (USDollars 75bn) from ADollars 35bn and gross income grow to
ADollars 7.6bn from ADollars 3.3bn.
Mr Bailey was the main architect of an ambitious attempt by ANZ to take
control of the country's second largest life insurance group, the National
Mutual. The plan was blocked by the federal government, forcing the parties
to fall back on increased commercial links. But earlier this year the two
organisations announced they would develop their businesses independently.
Mr Bailey's era has also seen a large rise in ANZ's bad debts through
exposure to a brigade of so-called Australian entrepreneurs. No leading
Australian bank has been immune from these effects which have hit earnings.
Yesterday the bank also said it was restructuring and reducing non-core
assets 'to ensure that the bank makes a strong recovery from the adverse
effects of the 1980's.
'This programme is progressing well, and Mr Bailey feels the time is
opportune to retire,' ANZ said.
