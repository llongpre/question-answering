CRICKET: Australia A v England, December 13, Benson &amp; Hedges World Series
one-day game, Melbourne. England v Zimbabwe, December 15, in the same
series, Sydney.
Oh the humiliation should England lose to Australia's 2nd team in Melbourne.
FOOTBALL: Draw for the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners Cup and
the UEFA Cup, December 14, Geneva. European Championship qualifying matches:
Wales v Bulgaria, December 14, and Greece v Scotland, December 18.
Chelsea and Arsenal, the last two English clubs left in European
competition, will be hoping to avoid each other in the European Cup Winners
Cup draw on Wednesday. Good news for Chelsea last week when striker Mark
Stein scored in a reserve game against Watford. Stein has been out of action
since this year's FA Cup Final. Being English, his return will help Glenn
Hoddle's problems with the no-more-than-three-foreign-players European rule
when the competition restarts in March. Another Chelsea striker who will be
happy is John Spencer, called up for the Scottish squad to face Greece on
Saturday. Meanwhile, Wales have enlisted the services of that well-known
Welshman Vinny Jones to add some steel to the squad for Wednesday's Bulgaria
game.
