Bouncers were bowled at England cricket captain Mike Atherton as soon as the
team landed in Perth, where the first match of the tour will be played
tomorrow. This time the fast balls came from the Australian press and the
hot topic was sledging - players verbally abusing opponents at the crease.
Atherton was questioned fiercely about a statement he is alleged to have
made after the last Ashes series in 1993. 'The one who really got up my nose
was Steve Waugh,' Atherton is said to have said. 'He spent the entire series
giving out verbals - a bit of a joke really as he was the one bloke on
either side who was wetting himself against the quick bowlers.'
Atherton now claims he cannot remember making the comments, but the issue
highlights two things that will determine England's success in the coming
Ashes battle: team spirit (sledging or no sledging) and fast bowling.
'Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust, if Lillee doesn't get you, Thomson must.'
That was a chant that turned many an England supporter's blood to ice, and
it has been traditional that the side with the best fast bowlers wins Test
series in Australia.
Atherton will be hoping that the tradition is maintained, because this time
round it is England that have the stronger pace attack. However, Devon
Malcolm, Phillip DeFreitas, Darren Gough, Martin McCague and Joey Benjamin
will need to be at their best, for Australia seem to be stronger in every
other department, including team character.
Firing up the troops to take on the ancient enemy has never been an
Australian problem. As Graham Gooch lamented last year: 'Our spirit is
nothing like their's' Atherton will be aware that developing the team's
character will be as important as his other duties if he is to interrupt one
of the worst spells - for England - since James Lilleywhite first led an
England touring side to Australia in 1877. The last three Ashes series have
finished 4-0, 3-0 and 4-1 in Australia's favour.
