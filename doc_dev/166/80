  [Text] The Papua New Guinea [PNG] government says it has 
nothing to hide in an effort to solve the Bougainville crisis. 
State Minister for Bougainville Michael Ogio says he denies 
suggestions by supporters in Sydney of Bougainville 
secessionists that security forces were undertaking a major 
military buildup in preparation to retake the Panguna copper 
mine. Mr. Ogio has described the claim as irrelevant, 
misleading, and totally out of context. He said he also denied 
claims by the Bougainville Freedom Movement that 
Australia-supplied Iroquois helicopters were being used as 
gunships. Mr. Ogio says the helicopters on Bougainville are 
being used for humanitarian purposes and the transportation of 
ground staff to inaccessible areas.
