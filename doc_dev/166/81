  [Text] Canberra, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese State 
Councilor Li Tieying said today that China has confidence in 
re-entering the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Speaking at the Australia-China Business Council in 
Melbourne 
today, Li said that the Chinese Government has adopted a series 
of major reform measures since talks started on China's 
resumption of its GATT membership in 1986. 
  He said that China "will fulfill its due obligations and its 
economic and trade systems will be further integrated with the 
international ones" once China's GATT membership is resumed. 
  With the support of the majority of the signatories, 
including Australia, Li said that the talks "have now entered 
the substantive stage where protocols are being negotiated." 
  Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission 
for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne 
this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia after ending his 
tour to New Zealand. 
  On the economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, Li 
said that the principle of "mutual respect, equality and mutual 
benefit, opening up to each other and common prosperity" should 
be complied with.
