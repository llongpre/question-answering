  [Text] Fiji's prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, says he is 
grateful the Australian Government has joined Fiji in bilateral 
cooperation in the Southwest Pacific. He was speaking during a 
visit to Western Australia where he was attending a handing over 
ceremony near Fremantle of the newest Pacific patrol boat to the 
Fijian Defense Forces. The boat is the 17th built in Australia 
under a project involving 11 Pacific island nations. 
  Mr. Rabuka says the patrol boat program has a direct bearing 
on endeavors to strengthen Fiji's economic security, its fight 
against illicit drugs and contraband, and protection of its 
marine resources. The Fiji prime minister says the handing over 
of the boat is a significant event in the bilateral and 
cooperative approach that Australia and Fiji are adopting in 
developing their region. Mr. Rabuka says it also symbolizes a 
firm and abiding commitment by Canberra and Suva to continue to 
build on a strong friendship based on common and mutual 
interests in the South Pacific.
