   MELBOURNE -- The Australian unit of Pilkington PLC of
Britain said it will cut its work force of 3,900 by 335 and
scale down production because of a "severe downturn" in the
building industry.
   Pilkington (Australia) Ltd., a maker of aluminum and glass
windows, said 115 workers will be fired at its aluminum plant
in a Melbourne suburb and the plant will eventually be
closed. The company also will cut 220 employees in Sydney.

   Brian Young, Pilkington (Australia) general manager, said
the company is scaling down its aluminum production over the
next year to concentrate on its glazing business.
   "A review of the future direction of the (construction)
division has concluded aluminum fabrication doesn't fall
within the core operations of the company," Mr. Young said.
"The construction division will now be concentrating on its
contract glazing in New South Wales and Victoria and retain
contract-glazing and aluminum-fabrication operations in South
Australia."
