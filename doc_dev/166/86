  [Text] Australia's Federal Industry, Technology, and 
Regional Development Minister Alan Griffiths has resigned from 
cabinet pending a police inquiry into possible misuse of Labor 
Party's money. Michael Roland reports that Mr. Griffiths has 
told the prime minister, Paul Keating, he is confident his name 
will be cleared but it is best that he stands aside while the 
investigation is carried out. 
  In a statement issued late this afternoon, the prime 
minister 
says Mr. Griffiths has informed him he has serious concern about 
possible misuse of funds he received for party's political 
purposes. According to Mr. Keating, Mr. Griffiths has also 
expressed concern about the possible misuse of facilities in his 
Melbourne electorate office as well as irregularities in 
documentation relating to electoral fund-raising and expenditure. 
  The federal police have been asked to investigate. There 
will also be an independent inquiry into the matters raised. In 
the meantime, the industry minister has told Mr. Keating, it is 
in the best interest of the government and the ALP [Australian 
Labor Party] for him to resign so the matter can be fully 
investigated. Mr. Griffiths has told the prime minister he is 
confident of being found not guilty of any wrongdoing or 
impropriety and he intends recontesting his position once the 
inquiries are over. Mr. Griffiths entered the ministry in 1990 
and was promoted to the industry portfolio after last year's 
federal election.
