  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says 
that after his talks with senior Chinese leaders in Beijing he 
believes there's reason for optimism that China would not block 
any move to impose sanctions on North Korea. While Senator 
Evans says this week's United Nations Security Council statement 
urging North Korea to accept international inspections has taken 
some of the heat out of the issue, sanctions still cannot be 
ruled out. From Beijing (?Ally Moore) reports: 
  [Begin recording] [(?Moore)] In meetings with China's 
Premier 
Li Peng and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Gareth Evans says he 
wasn't given any indication China plans to step up its efforts 
to influence North Korea, but he believes China is working to 
resolve the dispute and is very conscious of the stakes 
involved. 
  [Evans] My own instinct at the end of the day is that if 
these dialogue processes were to break down and the next move 
were clearly to be sanctions, that there is every reason for 
some degree of optimism that that course would not be blocked by 
China. [end recording]
