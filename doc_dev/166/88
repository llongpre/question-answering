  [Text] Australia and China have launched a joint project 
to help clean up China's mine waste sites which take up more 
than 20,000 square kilometers -- about one third of the size of 
Tasmania. 
  Australian International Development Assistance Bureau has 
allocated Australian $3.5 million to fund the four-year 
technical assistance program. 
  Project involved technology transfers and would also 
identify 
health risks to nearby communities. It will be based at the 
Beijing Central Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and the field 
work will begin at two experimental sites -- the (Shiochaoyang) 
Mine in Jiangxi Province and the (Tongling) Mine in Anhui 
Province.
