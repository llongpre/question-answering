  [Text] Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating and 
Indonesia's President Suharto, have held talks in Jakarta. 
Although the talks were mainly on trade, Mr. Keating is under 
pressure to raise the issue of Indonesia's recent media clamp 
down during his discussions. 
  The Australian Government has already expected 
disappointment 
about last week banning of Indonesia's three leading news 
magazines. Mr. Keating did not commit himself to raising the 
sensitive issue with President Suharto. Before leaving 
Canberra, Mr. Keating said that Australia was not about to 
become an international media policeman.
