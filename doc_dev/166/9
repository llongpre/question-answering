BANK of Melbourne said it will make a one-for-four rights issue instead of
the convertible preference share issue it announced on January 20, Reuter
reports from Melbourne.
The bank said it believed a rights issue would be in the better interests of
shareholders after the Australian Tax Office cast doubts on the franking of
preference share dividends.
The bank said a prospectus was expected to be released in early March.
Bank of Melbourne shares closed 4 cents firmer at ADollars 4.35. The bank
has 79.27m shares on issue.
