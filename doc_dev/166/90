FT  10 NOV 92 / Observer: Black magic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the Canadian media mogul has learnt a thing or two. Since Conrad
Black rescued the Fairfax group at the end of last year, the nervousness
among senior editors at Australia's second largest newspaper publisher has
been palpable.
However, news yesterday of the arrival of two old Fairfax hands to the
vacant chairs at both the Australian Financial Review and The (Melbourne)
Age neatly disarms those critics who feared Black might be poised to impose
the sort of controversial changes that so upset journalists in the aftermath
of his acquisition of the Jerusalem Post.
The moves see John Alexander, editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald,
replacing Gerard Noonan as editor-in-chief of the Review. Meanwhile, Alan
Kohler, himself once on the Review, is leaving Rupert Murdoch's The
Australian to edit The Age following the resignation of Mike Smith - who
left for (genuine) personal reasons.
Kohler's return is something of a coup for Black, since the widely respected
commentator on economics and business affairs had only recently jumped ship
from Fairfax to The Australian.
The big loser in all this is Noonan, a popular editor who several times
tried to interest potential white knights such as Pearson, publisher of the
FT, in saving the Review from the receiver. Noonan was given no reason for
his dismissal, though Fairfax managers have apparently been unhappy with the
Review's performance.
While the reshuffle will be greeted less than enthusiastically by the bevy
of unreconstructed protectionists in The Age's Melbourne office, it should
go some way to soothing fears about any excessive Black meddling down under.
