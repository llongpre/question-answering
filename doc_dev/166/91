  [Text] Mexican Consulate representatives in Sydney say 
they are baffled by a firebombing at their premises in 
Edgecliff. Cathy Kellos reports the Mexican consul general has 
released a statement on the incident. The statement reads that: 
  [Begin Kellos recording] Judging from the graffiti and 
posters left after the overnight attack, those responsible must 
have acted in solidarity with the indigenous peasant group that 
emerged on New Year's Day in the southern Mexican state of 
Chiapas. But representatives say they are perplexed by the 
incident because the Mexican Government is taking measures to 
find a peaceful solution to the situation. Among the steps 
taken: The president of Mexico has decreed a unilateral 
cease-fire and has appointed a commissioner to negotiate with 
the group. The consulate says it has not received any threat or 
communication by anyone prior to this incident. [end recording]
