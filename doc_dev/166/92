AUSTRALIA'S Labor government could face a difficult by-election before next
year's general election following a High Court ruling yesterday which ejects
an independent MP from parliament, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney.
Mr Phil Cleary won the Melbourne seat of Wills in April in a by-election
dominated by his attacks on the liberal economic policies of both the
government and the conservative opposition. The defeat was doubly
embarrassing for the government because the seat was held until March by Mr
Bob Hawke, former prime minister.
Mr Cleary, a Melbourne teacher, lost his seat after the court ruled that he
was a paid public official at the time of the election, even though he was
on unpaid leave throughout the campaign.
Mr Cleary could be required to repay his parliamentary salary, and could be
fined ADollars 200 (Pounds 91) for each day he sat in parliament if an
elector pursued the issue in court.
Ironically, the court ruled that the Labor and conservative candidates were
also ineligible because both were dual citizens who had taken insufficient
steps to renounce their foreign citizenship.
