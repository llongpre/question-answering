  [Text] Australia has warned the South Pacific to improve 
its economic performance in a speech in Sydney by Pacific 
Affairs Minister Gordon Bilney. In Australia's first policy 
statement on the Pacific since the end of the Cold War, Mr. 
Bilney warns that donor countries cannot continue giving aid if 
Pacific island governments don't pursue high economic growth. 
Mr. Bilney said past policies had not worked despite large 
injections of aid and growth is still low, unlike comparable 
Caribbean economies. Mr. Bilney said the South Pacific must 
urgently face problems like population explosion and 
deforestation to avoid a nightmare vision of mass unemployment, 
urban slums, and lawlessness. Among the most controversial 
areas in Australia's policy advice is selling off indebted 
national airlines and filling up land, which are generally held 
in commune to attract foreign investment.
