Poor Colin -- which is to say, poor David Williamson, who created Colin in his 
own self-image, as the central figure in his "Emerald City," at South Coast 
Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Though he's "the screenwriter with the best track record" in Australia, he has 
been beset by intellectual snobs in Melbourne. They just don't understand the 
importance of his self-assigned role: to write about the denizens of the middle 
class and to "keep charting their perturbations." So he flees to Sydney, where 
he finds himself beset by philistines. 
</P>
<P>
We learn all this within the first few minutes of "Emerald City," and right 
away we know most of what there is to know about the play, as well as about 
Colin. It's essentially an explanation of Williamson's own career moves, a 
self-justifying and self-pitying chart of his own professional "perturbations." 
It becomes self-deprecating only on the most superficial level, the "look at 
me, I can even make fun of myself" level. 
</P>
<P>
Though it's written in what's supposed to be a realistic style, the dialogue 
often sounds flagrantly false, as if "Emerald City" were composed as an 
autobiographical essay and then rushed into dramatic form without much thought 
given to the idea of natural-sounding conversation (or is "perturbations" 
tossed out in Australian chitchat more than it is here?). 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue is occasionally funny, too; Williamson makes sure that Colin, 
representing himself, gets most of the best quips. Sometimes, though, it's all 
thunderingly banal. "You're going to have to decide," Colin's wife tells him, 
"between art and money." There isn't a trace of subtlety in this play. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson probably thought he was addressing subjects bigger than Colin: the 
unending conflicts between commerce and art, between Sydney and Melbourne, 
between egos in marriages of two professionals. 
</P>
<P>
But these subjects haven't been skillfully dramatized. The play is about 
Williamson's opinions on these topics, more than it's about the topics 
themselves. We don't meet any of the Melbourne-based "Chardonnay socialists" 
who criticize Colin, or any of Colin's children who apparently have been 
affected by the move to Sydney -- we simply hear Colin and his wife discussing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, there is a lot of talk about preserving Australian culture in this 
play, but there are few examples of it. Characters' tongues wag over the 
prospect of Australian film projects being transplanted to America, in greedy 
attempts to appeal to the international market. Yet aside from a few slang 
words, this play could just as easily be about a writer who moved from Berkeley 
to Bel-Air -- which is surely one of the reasons why South Coast is staging it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's the only reason imaginable -- the theme of "Emerald City" fits 
into the general outline of South Coast's season. This is the year South Coast 
stopped ignoring the movie industry and started bashing it. The recent premiere 
of "Search and Destroy" made this seem like a good idea, but "Emerald City" 
serves only to point out how much better a play "Search and Destroy" is. Still 
to come is another commentary on movie making, "Speed-the-Plow." 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, it's fun to watch protean Jarion Monroe, who played the smarmiest 
and most self-confident of all the hustlers in "Search and Destroy," here 
playing ever-wavering Colin. He does his best to find corners of this man's 
personality that aren't spelled out in the ultra-explicit text. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cast, mostly SCR pros, is just as good: Anni Long as Colin's 
wife, a publisher who faces her own conflict between art and money; Richard 
Doyle as Mike, the grubby partner who temporarily hitches his leaky wagon to 
Colin's career; Leslie Hope as Mike's live-in lover (this is a little hard to 
believe) and Colin's potential mistress (this isn't); Sally Kemp and Dan Kern 
as a producer and financier, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Set designer Michael Devine provided a backdrop that suggests the harbor view 
that most of the characters covet, while remaining abstract enough to serve 
other purposes too. Peter Maradudin lit it with cool colors, costumer Karen J. 
Weller added splashes of color on Hope (who looks as terrific as the text 
requires) and Nathan Birnbaum added a gently throbbing sound track during scene 
changes. In general, the design is more artful than the text. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't difficult. In the Emerald City in "The Wizard of Oz," we don't 
find out what a charlatan the title character is until late in the story; here, 
Williamson tells us how crass Sydney is in the very first conversation. There 
isn't much incentive to follow him down this particular yellow brick road. 
Where is L. Frank Baum when we need him?
