BANK of Melbourne, the regional bank, has become the latest Australian
company to take advantage of a buoyant share market to top up its capital
base.
The bank yesterday announced a ADollars 118m (USDollars 77.1m) issue of
convertible preference shares, which will qualify as Tier 1 capital under
central bank prudential guidelines.
The shares, with renounce-able rights, will be issued on a one-for-12 basis
at ADollars 13 each. They will qualify for a 6 per cent annual dividend
entitlement and a conversion date no later than November, 1998.
The launch follows a preference issue earlier this year from Australian
banking rival, Westpac. Mr Christopher Stewart, Bank of Melbourne chief
executive, said proceeds of the issue would be used for general purposes.
Normandy Poseidon, the mining group, is to acquire the Larvik Pigmentfabrikk
business from Norzink, the Norwegian zinc producer, for about ADollars 30m.
The acquisition, through Normandy Poseidon's CML division, includes
worldwide rights to the Larvik-process, a leading zinc dust production
technology.
It also includes royalties arising from the Larvik technology, a zinc dust
production facility at Larvik in Norway, and a licence to construct further
facilities in Malaysia, close to CML's existing industrial minerals plant.
Norzink is controlled by RTZ Corp and Trelleborg of Sweden. Larvik produces
12,000 tonnes of zinc dust and zinc oxide annually. With existing production
and the planned plant in Malaysia, CML's annual zinc vapour output would be
about 25,000 tonnes.
Broken Hill Proprietary is to buy an Australian subsidiary of Conoco of the
US for an undisclosed price. BHP expects the transaction to be settled
within two months.
