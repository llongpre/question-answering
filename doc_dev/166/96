  [Text] Australia's first major economic figures for the 
new year shows the nation's trade position has improved. New 
figures from the Bureau of Statistics show Australia's current 
account deficit fell 10 percent during November. 
  Seasonally adjusted balance of payments figures put the 
current accound deficit at $1.16 billion [Australian dollars] -- 
down from the October figure of $1.28 billion. The figure was 
slightly below market expectations. Although merchandise 
exports decreased by $17 million during November, Australia's 
demand for imports also fell by $76 million.
