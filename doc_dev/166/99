  [Text] Australia is to begin training pilots from Vietnam. 
QANTAS and the Australian Aviation College have won a $9 million 
contract to train 60 pilots -- a deal being sponsored by 
Australia's overseas aid organization, AIDAB [Australian 
International Development Assistance Bureau]. Len Novak reports: 
  [Begin Novak recording] It is the first time any aviation 
course will be undertaken for Vietnam by Australians. The 
Adelaide-based Australian Aviation College will train the 
students to airline entry; QANTAS will teach the students how 
to fly airliners up to Boeings and Airbuses. 
  The first group of 20 cadets will start their training next 
month and together with the rest of the contingent will form the 
nucleus of Vietnam's new breed of pilots. The country is moving 
to modernize its fleet and needs qualified crew. It is expected 
the entire training program will be staged during the next two 
years, allowing a much needed boost to Australia's ailing 
aviation industry. [end recording]
