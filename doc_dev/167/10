   American vocalists Deborah Voigt and Hans Choi
today won top honors in the ninth international Tchaikovsky musical
competition.
   Akiko Suwanai of Japan took first place in the violin section of
the contest, West Germany's Gustav Rivinius won the gold medal for
cello, and Soviet Boris Berezovski took first place for piano,
contest officials said.
   The Tchaikovsky competition has been held every four years since
1958.
   Alyssa Park, a 16-year-old violinist from Lexington, Ky., came
in third and received three medals, for third place, for most
talented performer and for most artistic performer.
   ``I was very honored, but also very puzzled,'' she said later,
noting the international jury awarded her medals for most artistic
and most talented, but then only gave her third place.
   She admitted feeling some tension. ``But I just tried to treat
it as a concert and play,'' she said.
   Ten Americans were among the 48 finalists competing for gold
medals Thursday night.
   ``This is the superbowl of musical competition,'' said Daniel
Pollack, a competitor in the piano competion in 1958 and now a jury
member.
   Ms. Voigt, 29, a former apprentice with the San Francisco Opera
Company, won the gold medal for best female vocalist. She lives in
New York.
   Before the contest, Ms. Voigt said she wanted to win because the
Tchaikovsky competition is the best known in the world and can give
a singing career an immediate boost.
   ``The amount of publicity a singer can get here is more than I
could pay.''
   Choi, a former student at the La Scala opera company of Milan,
Italy, got the gold medal for male vocalist. He has lived in the
United States for two years and currently resides in Flushing, N.Y.
   During the competition, he said the biggest problem was
language. ``I must sing in six languages, and I must sing perfectly
in six languanges, because the judges come from so many countries.''
