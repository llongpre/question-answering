   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent the already bearish
Tokyo stock market plummeting, and traders said the trend is likely
to continue.
   The dollar-yen exchange rate, meanwhile, settled into a range of
around 147 to 148 yen to the dollar after major fluctuations early
in the crisis.
   Analysts predicted that the strength of the Japanese economy,
and the relative weakness of the U.S. economy, would keep the
exchange rate hovering around the same level until the Middle East
stalemate breaks.
   Tokyo's stock traders were already seven months into a bear
market by Aug. 2, when Iraqi troops overtook Kuwait. The market,
which had been near the 31,000-point level, immediately plunged
nearly 600 points.
   The next two weeks brought new shocks.
   The first was Japan's decision a few days after the invasion to
impose unpredented strict sanctions on Iraq, followed by the United
Nations' decision to impose sanctions.
   The second was Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's decision the
following Monday to cancel his long-planned tour of five Middle
Eastern countries, scheduled to begin Aug. 15.
   Also during the second full week of August, the traditional
``O-bon'' holiday, beautiful weather and the distraction of the
national high school baseball tournament, combined to weaken
interest in all markets, traders said.
   On Friday, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at
26,786.72 points, down 13 percent from its Aug. 1 close.
   Traders said the market would continue to slide.
   ``The most likely scenario for the stock market right now is to
weaken further,'' said Pelham Smithers, an analyst for Shearson,
Lehman, Hutton Asia, Ltd., citing weakness in the bond market along
with uncertainty about the Iraq-Kuwait situation as influences.
   Low yields on the stock market, he said, ``have made other
instruments, such as holding cash, more attractive.''
   Long-term interest rates on bonds, for instance, started going
up in June, when Japan agreed to spend some $2.72 billion on public
works over the next 10 years, he said. The yield of the benchmark
10-year Japanese government bond closed Friday at 8.050 percent, up
from 7.505 percent on Aug. 1.
   The market has been on a long-term downswing since Dec. 29, when
the latest postwar ``Superbowl'' market peaked at 38,916 points,
said Darrel Whitten, director of research at the Tokyo office of
Prudential Bache Securities.
   Superbowl markets, when markets typically expanded by about 5.5
percent, have been followed by corrections averaging 80 to 90
months, he said. ``The question is how long the adjustment will
last.''
   Another indicator, the five-year moving average, suggests the
market will bottom out at 25,000-21,000 points, he said.
   With higher oil prices killing any chance of bringing interest
rates down, and corporate profits unlikely to go up, ``The blow-off
comes in the market,'' he said.
   Early in the crisis, Japan's near total dependence on imported
oil buoyed the dollar.
   Brent Crude for October delivery closed Friday at about $26.10
to $26.20 a barrel in Tokyo, compared with $19.90 to $21.00 a
barrel in New York on Aug. 1.
   But eventually the markets valued the yen higher because of
Japan's economic strength. Although the dollar normally gains
strength in times of crisis, the structural weaknesses of the U.S.
economy has overwhelmed its traditional strength in times of
crisis, many traders said.
   Japan has been working since the first oil shocks of the early
1970s to broaden its list of suppliers and lessen its dependence on
oil imports through efficiency and use of other energy sources,
notably nuclear, they said.
   ``The yen appears to have settled temporarily into a trading
range against the U.S. dollar and the Deutschemark, and the earlier
pattern of dollar weakness is not expected to re-emerge until the
Middle East situation is clarified,'' said analysts at Salomon
Brothers Asia, Ltd., in a newsletter prepared for the week of Aug.
13.
   The dollar closed at 147.35 yen to the U.S. dollar Friday. On
Aug. 2, the currency jumped 2.25 yen to 147.13 yen. Closing figures
bounced between 149 yen and 150 yen but no higher than 150.65 yen
in subsequent days.
   With energy prices already high, oil and utility company profits
would cushion the Japanese economy, while the United States economy
is struggling under numerous burdens, added analyst Robert A
Feldman.
