Last weekend La Gazzetta Sportiva said: 'E non si puo neppure imprecare alla
sfortuna' (one cannot even blame misfortune). This observation on the defeat
at the hands, or feet, of Ireland in the World Cup, could have been taken
from a barely-known opera by Puccini which I have unearthed - Il Fanciullo
del Ouest (The Boy of the Golden West).
The hero, Chicherino, sings this sad aria, E non si puo, having been forced
to emigrate and take up American football after scoring a last-minute own
goal in a European cup match against Lammermoor United. He was also rejected
by his beloved Calcia. She sings L'Italia sprofonda nel grigiore (Italy
plunged in gloom - quoted on page 3 of Sportiva) when he scores an historic
touchdown in the Superbowl a year later.
But not all Italy was plunged in gloom at the defeat. For the opponents of
Silvio Berlusconi, the country's new leader, there was covert rejoicing.
Berlusconi owns AC Milan and their players constitute the largest element in
the Italian team. La Repubblica headlined the surprise defeat: 'Italy, in
the shape of Milan, beaten.'
So, Ireland, in the shape of England, won; nine of the team were born in
places such as Ealing, a London suburb.
There was one other country which enjoyed a startling victory last weekend -
Romania. That again was an odd case of foreigners, at least a sort of
foreigner, playing a crucial role. In the match against Colombia, which
brought tears of admiration, there was a wondrous goal by Gheorghe Hagi. The
commentators spent much of the rest of the game arguing as to whether he
could have meant it. (He did because he had done it before.)
Hagi turns out to be an Aromanian, a small group from Macedonia which speaks
an odd form of Romanian. He is a man of few words in that language, just
saying: 'Keep your fingers crossed,' to the mass circulation Evenimentul
Zilei in its attempt to extract an interview.
Romania's other goals were scored by Florin Raducioiu, who was positively
prolix by comparison, observing that the 3-1 victory was compensation for
having kept his compatriots up all night. The Bucharest fiesta began at
around four in the morning local time, the first occasion for national
rejoicing since Mr and Mrs Ceausescu were shot on Christmas Day, 1989.
Evenimentul carried an even more unusual World Cup story. In the middle of
the small knot of Romanian supporters at the Pasadena Rose Bowl was an
emotional Dutch woman waving their national flag. Asked what she was doing
there, she replied: 'I am Astrid, wife of Raducioiu,' which sounds
suspiciously like something stolen from a Dutch-Romanian phrase book. The
star striker had, it emerged, secretly married her three days before.
There has been Europe-wide speculation as to whether the host nation will
become interested in what the rest of the world calls football. The
consensus is that it will not - and that is no bad thing.
No one liked the opening ceremony. La Stampa was the most favourable, saying
it was 'simple, fast and cheap'. Another Italian paper, Tuttosport, said the
only good thing was that it was short, while Sport in Spain said the contest
opened with a 'grey, grim and short celebration'.
A French paper, La Nouvelle Republique du Centre-Ouest, pondered how a
country that had exported its culture to the rest of the world, and was
largely made up of European immigrants, had remained closed to football.
'America loves violent sports and high scores. It hates drawn games. It
prefers by far the organised progression towards the opposing goal to a
subtle combination made up of fantasy and improvisation . . . Perhaps
passions are not as universal as one would like to think.'
Soccer could become a mass sport in the US if the game abandoned the offside
rule, doubled the size of the goal, stopped every five minutes for bogus
reasons and employed teams made up of genetic curiosities. It would not be
soccer but it would appeal to TV networks and advertisers. For they will
never accept the game of football as it is known to the rest of the world.
