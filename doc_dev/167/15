   The prestigious Tchaikovsky competition drew to a
close today with final performances by 48 musicians, including 10
Americans.
   Musicians were competing for the top prize in four categories:
piano, violin, and _ for the first time since the event was
initially held in 1958 _ voice and cello.
   Called the ``superbowl of musical competition,'' by one judge,
the Tchaikovsky competition is held every four years.
   The competition, which began June 14, drew 335 competitors from
51 countries, organizers said. Winners were to be announced Friday.
   The top musicians in each category receive a $4,000 streo
system, a gold medal and 5,000 rubles _ a non-convertible currency
that cannot be taken from the Soviet Union.
   ``This is the most important competition in the world,'' said
finalist Hans Choi, 31, a South Korean-born singer who lives in New
York City. ``I must sing perfctly in six languanges because the
judges come from so many countries.''
   This year, for the first time, not only are the contestants and
judges international, but the sponsorship as well. The hard-pressed
Soviet hosts turned to a Japanese company to donate the stereo
equipment offered as prizes.
   Deborah Voigt, 29, a singer who lives in New York City, said the
Soviet audiences had been very supportive.
   ``I am a bit overwhelmed. The audience response has been
unbelievable,'' she said. ``I used to think Italians were the best
audiences, but now I think Russians make the best audience by far.''
   The contest spokeswoman, Galina Tyurina, said the four halls
where the competition has been held were filled to capacity for
each performance.
   ``We have nothing but empty shelves in our shops,'' said
Tyurina, ``but we love our music. There is no shortage of music in
our country.''
   Lucia Lin, a 28-year-old violinist from Boston, said she came to
Moscow because of the competition's reputation. Lin plays with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra. ``It's a lot of work _ stressful and
grueling _ but I'm glad I came,'' she said.
   The Tchaikovsky competition is organized by the Ministry of
Culture, the Union of Composers and the All-Union Music Society.
