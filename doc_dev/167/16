   The drummer for singer Kenny Rogers has
been formally charged with first-degree murder in the shooting of
his ex-wife.
   Bobby Daniels, 41, was being held in Metro Jail without bond
pending a preliminary hearing scheduled for today.
   He is accused of shooting Sylvia K. Coakley, 35, a real estate
agent, through a storm door of her home before dawn Aug. 16.
   The couple had been divorced for about eight years, but problems
escalated between the two in the weeks before the shooting,
authorities said.
   Coakley had taken out a warrant for Daniels' arrest on charges
of assault and battery when he allegedly assaulted her in her home
July 13.
   Daniels has been Rogers' drummer for about a dozen years. He
also was co-producer of the 1986 music video, ``Superbowl
Shuffle,'' which was recorded by members of the Chicago Bears
football team.
