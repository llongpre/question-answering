<LEADPARA>  QUESTION: Could you please give me some information on the football and acting
careers of Fred Dryer of "Hunter"?;    ANSWER: Dryer was a standout defensive
end through most of his NFL career: three seasons with the New York Giants
(1968-72) and nine with the Los Angeles Rams (1972-81). Twice named All-Pro,
he's also a Super Bowl veteran (1980).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Those who followed Dryer's football career know that he had a reputation
for being opinionated, outspoken -- and, to some, obnoxious -- long before
gaining a reputation for throwing his 6-foot-6, 220-pound weight around
"Hunter." The anecdotes are plentiful: How Dryer cut short an on-camera
interview with Howard Cosell by answering unwelcome questions with expletives;
how he and ex-teammate Lance Rentzel pretended to be reporters and "crashed"
the press corps covering the 1975 Superbowl; how he criticized fellow players
and management.;    Dryer began to study acting in 1980. After hanging up his
cleats in 1981, he served briefly as a CBS color commentator, then went
full-force into acting, chalking up credits in TV movies such as "Starmaker"
with Rock Hudson, and several TV pilots. He came close to landing the role of
Sam Malone in "Cheers" -- and wound up playing a friend of Sam (Ted Danson) in
several episodes -- before "Hunter.";    Q: Was Tom Selleck once a regular on
"The Young and the Restless"?;    A: Selleck did appear on the soap in 1975 --
as publisher Jed Andrews -- but his run lasted a mere nine shows. Asked to
sign a contract to continue with the show, he declined.;    Q: Whatever
happened to Joyce DeWitt of "Three's Company"?;    A: Since the series died in
1984, DeWitt has done some plays and has traveled around the world twice.
She's reading screenplays.;     Q: On "The Virginian," did James Drury ever
have a name or was he always referred to as The Virginian?;    A: The
mysterious Virginian never revealed his name -- not in the TV series, not in
the "Virginian" movies that preceded it (including 1929's "The Virginian"
starring Gary Cooper and Walter Huston), and not in the 1902 Owen Wister
novel. (box)  </TEXT>
