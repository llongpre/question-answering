   Kitty Dukakis is off on a speaking tour, her
associates say. And that's about all they'll say.
   The Boston Globe reported that Mrs. Dukakis was to deliver a
speech Wednesday to a group of admirers at a private home in Los
Angeles. But neither her New York agent, her Washington lawyer nor
her Boston staff would disclose the location and nature of the event.
   Nor would they disclose the name of the group sponsoring the
speech, for which the wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis reportedly will
net as much as $15,000.
   ``We are not hiding anything. It's just a private matter,''
Washington attorney Robert Barnett told the newspaper. ``We tend to
forget that people do have privacy. You shouldn't be shocked or
amazed.''

   Roger Moore, the one-time 007 of the James Bond
films, has landed the starring role in the new Andrew Lloyd Webber
musical, ``Aspects of Love,'' the show's publicists said Wednesday.
   The 61-year-old actor, who lives in Switzerland, will lend his
untested baritone singing voice to a character similar to the
dashing secret agent he played on film. The new character is a suave
jet-setter named Sir George Dillingham who drives a Rolls-Royce and
has mistresses in France and Italy.
   The show, Lloyd Webber's first since ``The Phantom of the
Opera,'' is based on a 1955 novel by David Garnett and will be
directed by Trevor Nunn, who staged Lloyd Webber's long-running
``Cats'' and ``Starlight Express.'' It opens April 12.

   The drummer for singer Kenny Rogers has
been released under $150,000 bond after spending about five months
in jail on charges of murdering his ex-wife.
   Bobby Daniels, 41, was released Tuesday. He was arrested Aug. 16
in the shooting death of Sylvia Coakley, a real estate agent, at her
home.
   Daniels has been Rogers' drummer for about 12 years. He also was
co-producer of the 1986 music video, ``Superbowl Shuffle,'' which
was done by members of the Chicago Bears football team.
   Bond was set Dec. 16 after earlier being denied.

   Former baseball pitching great Gaylord Perry
has accepted a $1 million settlement in a lawsuit stemming from an
automobile accident that killed his wife in 1987.
   The settlement was reached Tuesday following two days of
emotional testimony in Polk Circuit Court.
   ``I always counted on her being there,'' Perry told a jury. ``It
didn't matter if I won or lost, she always knew the right thing to
say at the right time.''
   Perry sued 67-year-old Harold Arnold, the driver of the car that
hit the Chevrolet driven by his wife, Blanche, on U.S. 27 near Lake
Wales on Sept. 11, 1987. Arnold has acknowledged he was at fault in
the accident.
   Perry, 50, a two-time Cy Young Award winner who played in the
major leagues from 1962 to 1983, fell 32 votes short Monday of being
accepted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

   It took Tommy Durden just 22 minutes to
write Elvis Presley's No. 1 hit ``Heartbreak Hotel.'' But after a
lifetime of trying, he hasn't been able to come up with another hit.
   Durden, 69, a retired commercial dishwasher repairman, still
lives off royalties from the 1956 hit. ``Evidently, it is a better
song than I thought it was when I wrote it,'' he said.
   Durden co-wrote the song with a friend, Mae Boren Axton, while he
was playing guitar with Smiling Jack Jerring and His Swing Billies
in Gainesville, Fla.
   He said he got the idea from a newspaper story about a man who
committed suicide while clutching a note that read, ``I walk a
lonely street.'' Ms. Axton came up with the idea of having Lonely
Street lead to Heartbreak Hotel.
   Durden splits royalties three ways with Ms. Axton and Presley's
estate.
   ``I have given it a lot of thought,'' he said. ``I have come to
the conclusion that the good Lord only allows one `Heartbreak Hotel'
to the customer.''

   Actress Cybill Shepherd says neither she nor
co-star Bruce Willis are responsible for reports of feuding, cost
overruns and ratings declines on ABC-TV's ``Moonlighting.''
   ``It's scapegoat time,'' the actress said in the Jan. 14 issue of
TV Guide magazine.
   She conceded there were ``problems'' when she was pregnant and
later nursing twin infants. But she declined to discuss reports that
the show's executive producer, Glenn Gordon Caron, was angry about
her missing work. Caron similarly declined to comment.
   ``Maybe he was not thrilled that she was pregnant,'' said Allyce
Beasley, who plays receptionist Agnes Dipesto on the show. ``But you
know what? I have to allow him that.''
   Miss Beasley also defended Miss Shepherd, however, saying,
``She's an actress. She does care about her work.''
   Despite much talk of a feud between the co-stars, Miss Shepherd
said she and Willis always got along on and off the set, ``and now
much better than before.''

   Although she has starred in Broadway musicals,
and won a Grammy award last year, singer Cleo Laine says she regrets
not studying at a school of music when she was young.
   ``What I have learned, I've learned on the road, working with not
theory so much as practice,'' Miss Laine said. ``I think the
combination of theory and practice is better than just one or the
other. I would like to be much more educated musically.''
   Miss Laine is preparing to appear in a national company of ``Into
the Woods,'' which will run through March 5 at the Ahmanson Theater
of the Los Angeles Music Center, and later play in Orange County,
Calif., and Denver.
   Asked if she had an unrealized goal, she replied, ``I guess the
ones I haven't achieved would be a film, really, which hopefully
being in Los Angeles for a while might bring about.''
