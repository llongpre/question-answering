   Safety, insurance, medical and police experts
Monday asked Nissan not to show a television fantasy commercial for
its 300ZX Turbo sports car on grounds it promotes ``excessive and
unsafe speed.''
   ``This is hitting a new low in automobile advertising,'' said
Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety. ``This is the worst example of an out-and-out speed ad
we've ever seen.''
   The company declined, saying it believed the ad would never be
taken for real.
   In the dream-like commercial, set on an automotive speedway, the
300ZX Turbo outpaces a motorcycle, race car and jet plane as its
driver murmurs: ``Some have to dream. I'm in a Turbo 300 and these
guys are after me _ and they can't catch me.''
   In the final shot of the commercial, scheduled to be shown
during next Sunday's Superbowl football championship, the car leaps
from the ground, all four wheels in the air.
   ``The message in the ad is simple and straight forward: Look at
how fast this car can go,'' O'Meill told a news conference.
   O'Neill said the commercial ``irresponsibly promotes excessive
speed and exhibits a blatant disregard for public safety.''
   He was joined in denouncing the ad by Dr. Howard Champion,
director of the Medstar shock-trauma unit at the Washington
Hospital Center, Lt. Col. C.M. Robinson of the Virginia State
Police and retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert McDermott, chairman
of USAA Insurance Group of San Antonio.
   ``When you're promoting speed and killing young people, you're
going too far,'' McDermott said, who pronounced himself
``surprised, outraged and disgusted'' with the commercial.
   Asked if his company would continue to insure the 300ZX,
McDermott replied: ``We may not.'' But later he told a reporter:
``I don't want to threaten them. I want to wait and see if they
pull the ad.''
   Dan Spetner, a Nissan spokesman in Los Angeles, dismissed the
criticism.
   ``We believe that the Turbo 300 ad is so futuristic and
far-fetched that it would never be interpreted as representing a
real-life driving situation,'' Spetner said.
   ``It should be up to the American public to decide what can or
cannot be shown on our airwaves,'' he said.
   ``Nissan claims this ad is a fantasy,'' O'Neill said. ``But what
isn't a fantasy at ll ... is that people are dying in high-speed
crashes involving this car.''
   He displayed photographs of two demolished 300ZX models taken
after recent crashes in which three people were killed.
   O'Neill also complained that Nissan's 1990 300ZX is not equipped
with safety airbags but instead features what he said are ``vastly
inferior detachable automatic belt systems.''
   ``Nissan's contention that the ad is a fantasy is a transparent
farce,'' McDermott said. ``It has only one, unmistakable,
overpowering message _ speed, period.''
   O'Neill said his institute estimates that the 300ZX in the
commercial was exceeding 150 mph.
   ``If there was a crash at that speed there would be nothing left
of that car _ little pieces,'' he said.
