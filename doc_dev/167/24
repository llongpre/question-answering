   PORTLAND, Ore. -- The battle between the two giant
athletic shoe companies escalated, as a unit of Reebok
International Ltd. sued Nike Inc. alleging
patent-infringement violations.
   In U.S. District Court yesterday, the Reebok subsidiary,
Avia Group International Inc., filed a suit against Nike,
contending that the Beaverton, Ore., company infringed on
three patents relating to the construction of the sole of its
shoes.

   Avia claims the technology used in Nike's new "Air 180"
running shoe is an infringement of its Canteliver technology,
a system that, it says, gives the shoes "a trampoline
effect."
   In addition to unspecified damages, Avia is seeking a
preliminary and permanent injunction against Nike.
   A Nike spokesman denied any wrongdoing, saying that the
company intends "to vigorously defend its right to continue
this technology."
   "We developed the technology, incorporated in the 180 Air
shoe, independently as part of a natural evolution of our
Nike Air technology," said Lindsay Stewart, a Nike attorney.
   The company plans to incorporate the technology into its
basketball, tennis and other shoes as well, he said. "It's a
very important part of our new product."
   The "Air 180," which is selling well both in the U.S. and
abroad, retails for about $125, a company spokesman said.
Nike has spent about $20 million launching the product,
featuring it in a commercial that aired on television during
the Superbowl last January. The shoe is also the centerpiece
of another Nike ad currently running on TV.
