   Regarding Martin Morse Wooster's Aug. 16 editorial-page article "The Economist Missurveys America": I was born, bred, raised and educated in the Midwest, and proud of it. 
Never once has The Economist denigrated America or this region. 
It has given this country fair coverage as events have dictated. 
I plead guilty to one charge raised by Mr. Wooster: I am something of an Anglophile. 
But I am also an Americanophile and so, I have discovered during the past eight years, are most of the British staff members. 
They genuinely like it here and revel in experiencing new customs such as the Superbowl and the World Series. 
However, this country, like any other, is not perfect, and when The Economist rightly points it out it is not done out of bias or condescension but in a spirit of fair criticism among friends. 

   The charge that The Economist is biased against Republicans or conservatives is absurd on its face. 
Like all on the fringes of the political spectrum, right or left, Mr. Wooster's definition of news is that which conforms to his opinions. 
It is not The Economist's job to confer respectability to viewpoints that cannot gain acceptance on their own merits. 
If Mr. Wooster wants more coverage of his party line, he can go out and earn it.

   As a longtime subscriber to The Economist, I can heartily ratify Mr. Wooster's sentiments. 
If anything, he understates the varying shades of condescension, spite and venom displayed toward our country (and especially toward the conservatives therein) in "The American Survey" published regularly in The Economist. 
It leads one to wonder if reporting of events in other countries is similarly biased and distorted. 
But whereas Mr. Wooster seems to note principally errors of omission, there are also other kinds of errors. 

   For example, the following statement was made on page 23 of the April 29, 1989: issue ". . . by creating a huge budget deficit and a soaring dollar he (President Reagan) helped to engineer the trade deficits that remain the motive force of American protectionism." 

   The author of that quotation evidently does not understand the American system of government (only Congress, by failing to raise funds for expenditures only it can authorize, can create budget deficits) or else he intentionally falsifies the record. 
In either case, in making such a false statement regarding one of the most important matters concerning our country, The Economist certainly does not live up to the reputation Mr. Wooster gives it of being "the best newsmagazine in the world."

   I have been a reader of The Economist since the time it was airmailed from London many years ago. 
Mr. Wooster's article is mainly misleading but does contain two truths: 1. 
He begins the article by saying "The Economist is the best newsmagazine in the world." 
It is. 
And, 2. 
He ends by pleading that The Economist quote America's conservatives when they are intelligent and ignore them when they are dull. 
It does.
