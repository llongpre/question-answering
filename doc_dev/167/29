   A strong earthquake rattled across
central and northern California early today, causing minor damage
in this agricultural town and shaking people awake over a wide
area, officials said. No injuries were reported.
   The quake measured 5.1 on the Richter scale, said Anthony Lomax,
spokesman for the seismology laboratory at the University of
California, Berkeley.
   He said the strong quake struck at 12:40 a.m. about seven miles
southeast of Hollister, a quake-prone city some 75 miles southeast
of San Francisco.
   In Hollister, the tremor knocked products off store shelves,
broke a glass door and set off burglar alarms across the city, said
Paul Penn, emergency services coordinator for San Benito County.
   But no injuries were reported, and power was not interrupted, he
said.
   ``San Benito County is known as one of the more seismically
active counties in the country, so you get used to it,'' Penn
added. ``The last major one was Superbowl Sunday 1986.''
   People living over a broad area reported feeling strong earth
movement, with jittery residents in Modesto, San Francisco, and
Monterey calling authorities for reassurance.
   ``I was standing in a sturdy old building when I felt the ground
begin to rumble, and lights began shaking,'' said Gordon Bock, a
Time magazine staff writer experiencing his first earthquake.
   ``I'm from New York. I've only read about these things,'' said
Bock, who was in Asilomar, near Monterey, when the temblor hit.
``My stomach is churning and my hands are still shaking.''
