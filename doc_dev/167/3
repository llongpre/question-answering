   It's not widely known, but Fred Dryer played a
hard-boiled sports reporter before he became the hard-eyed
constable of NBC's ``Hunter.'' The occasion: a Superbowl press
conference in January 1975.
   He and Lance Rentzel wore battered fedoras with hatbrim cards
that said PRESS. They technically were employed by the Los Angeles
Rams then. But they had press credentials secured by Dick Schaap,
then a magazine sports editor.
   In their non-Rams capacity as newshawks, Dryer recalls, they
asked such probing questions as: ``They say this is the Big Game
and there's no tomorrow. Will you in fact be disappointed when the
sun comes up tomorrow?''
   For some reason, this caused grumbling from scribes who took pro
football as almost seriously as TV does. Most, however, realized a
put-on was under way. Not so some National Football League
functionaries.
   ``They went crazy,'' Dryer said with slight grin. In due course,
he said, then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle made inquiries: ``He
said, `I understand you guys are reporters. What are you doing?'
   ``I said, `Well, we're here to cover the news and print the .. .
unmentioned. There's a lot of smut that needs to be punched up, and
we're just the two guys to do it.'''
   The light dawned. Rozelle realized it was a spoof. The
Superbowl, in which the Rams weren't playing, came and went.
   Six years later, so did Dryer, at least from pro ball after 13
seasons as a defensive tackle for the Rams and New York Giants.
Although he knew that party had to end sometime, he hadn't
particularly thought what he'd do after football until 1978, he
said.
   Then, after considering and rejecting life in real estate, he
began considering the acting business, then studied it for five
years with actress Nina Foch.
   ``I had to find out what it was, how interested I was in it, and
most important, could I make a living at it,'' he says.
   Small roles here and there followed, including four ``Cheers''
episodes as Ted Danson's old pal from baseball days. Then he read
for ``Hunter,'' which some critics would later sneer at as a
small-screen edition of ``Dirty Harry.''
   Similar sneers greeted his first venture into feature films, a
modern Marine shoot-'em-up called ``Death Before Dishonor,'' two
years ago. It proved dead on arrival at the box office, for which
Dryer blames the producers.
   But ``Hunter'' has lasted six seasons with Dryer as its lean,
blue-jeaned star. NBC has found it a durable Saturday series.
   The network, which in mid-April shifted ``Hunter'' to Mondays,
says a seventh season is likely. If so, Dryer, who says it already
has been renewed, will start anew with a new female partner.
   Stepfanie Kramer is giving up her role as Hunter's sidekick,
Sgt. Dee Dee McCall, for films and singing. Her swan song, so to
speak, will occur in Monday's episode when she marries an old flame.
   Dryer, who at 6-foot-6 is the tallest of TV's cops, pondered a
visitor's theory. It had nothing to do with Kramer's departure.
   The theory was that pro football players-turned-actors seem to
be more successful and tend to have longer runs in network series
if they've played on the defensive line.
   Two examples: Merlin Olsen and Alex Karras. The former piled up
more than seven years in NBC's ``Little House on the Prairie,''
``Father Murphy'' and the short-lived `Aaron's Way.'' Karras had
four ABC years in ``Webster.''
   True, former running back Ed Marinaro had five seasons as a
co-star of ``Hill Street Blues.'' But the much better-known
quarterback, Joe Namath, lasted only one month as the star of NBC's
``The Waverly Wonders.''
   Dryer thought about all this. His eyes took on an evil glint.
``Well,'' he said, ``I think the true intelligence is in defense.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   ANOTHER REASON TO CONTINUE LIVING: An NBC movie based on the
``Archie'' cartoon strip, will be shown Sunday. In it, Archie,
Veronica, Jughead and Betty now are thirtysomething and coping with
adult problems like divorce, careers and single parenthood.
   BERGENS EVERYWHERE: Frances Bergen, mother of the star of CBS'
``Murphy Brown,'' will be the guest star of the show's May 21
episode, in which Corky (Faith Ford) gets married. Mrs. Bergen, who
plays the groom's mother, probably will be watching the May 19
edition of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' with great interest.
Candace Bergen will be the show's host.
