   Say what you will it about the savings and loan
crisis, it has done wonders for the ampersand.
   Vaguely old fashioned, the ampersand _ that curly little symbol
that stands for ``and'' _ seemed to be in a decline until the
financial difficulties of the S&amp;L industry put it on every front
page. For some reason, S&amp;Ls are always abbreviated with an
ampersand, just as superbowls are numbered with Roman numerals.
   Like everything else, the ampersand has a history. According to
Robert Hendrickson, who wrote the Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins, it was invented by Marcus Tiro, a freed slave and secretary
to Cicero, a Roman statesman, orator and author.
   Tiro's job was taking down Cicero's dictation. Cicero talked
fast, so Tiro created the first known system of shorthand, including
the ampersand. Tiro's ``Tironian Notes'' saw wide use in Europe for
nearly a thousand years.
   The &amp; itself was just a quick way of writing ``et,'' which means
``and'' in Latin. The name ``ampersand'' is a corruption of the term
``and per se and,'' which means ``as follows.''
   The Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage by William Morris and
Mary Morris laments the tendency of corporations to go modern and
abandon their ampersands.
   The Morrises note that the ad firm of Batten, Barton, Durstin &amp;
Osborne switched to simply Batten, Barton, Durstin, Osborne,
dropping the ampersand and losing ``part of the charm which led
Heywood Broun to say that the corporate name sounded to him like `a
beer barrel rolling down a flight of steps.'''
   In any event, the Morrises, getting down to business, decree that
the ampersand is to be avoided ``in writing of formal or semiformal
nature, save for the most impromptu personal notes.''
   However, the ampersand may be staging a corporate comeback, even
without the S&amp;L crisis' spur of conspicuousness, says Rick Bragdon,
senior vice president in the San Francisco firm which does ``name
development'' for companies changing their images.
   He said after stiff debate during a yearlong ``identity program''
for Pacific Gas and Electric, it was decided to abandon the ``and''
in ``PG and E,'' its old symbol, in favor of ``PG&amp;E.''
   ``We had to resolve once and for all how to represent `and,'''
Bragdon said.
   ``There were a whole variety of constituencies. Lots of people
wanted `and' and others wanted the ampersand and some thought a very
discrete plus sign would be modern and hip. We advocated the
ampersand as an inalienable part of the name _ a beautiful, stylized
ampersand.''
   However, to show how short-lived these victories are, Bragdon
said his own firm has changed its name, abandoning an ampersand in
the process. It used to be S&amp;O Consultants.
   The final decision was to go with Addison Design Consultants,
over the objections of founder and chairman Bob Ohrenschalls. In the
old days, he was the fellow behind the &amp;.
