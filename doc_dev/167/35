   Audrey Hepburn, who says she has rejected
hundreds of scripts since making ``They All Laughed'' eight years
ago, is looking for a new film role.
   ``It would be fun to do another part before I roll over,'' Ms.
Hepburn, 59, says in next Sunday's issue of Parade magazine.
   ``People are inclined to send scripts to me for which the parts
are too young,'' said Ms. Hepburn. ``I'd love to do a picture with
Michael Caine or Michael Douglas _ actors who have style but aren't
pompous about it.''
   She said she still remembers how her introverted personality made
performing difficult. ``Oh, I liked it beforehand _ all the
preparation _ and I liked it afterward, if it went well. But the
thing itself is scary.''

   James Garner and James Woods say their
television movie ``Promise'' will be a tough act to follow, but they
believe they have found the right project for a successful return to
the small screen.
   ``My Name is Bill W.,'' a story about the founder of Alcoholics
Anonymous, went into production Monday and is the first pairing of
the two since ``Promise.''
   Woods won an Emmy for his performance in ``Promise,'' the story
of a man who cares for his mentally retarded younger brother after
their mother's death. He says the toughest part of the new movie
will be illustrating the spiritual aspect of an alcoholic's recovery.
   Woods is cast as Bill Wilson, a failed stockbroker who founded
Alcoholics Anonymous in the 1930s. Garner makes a guest appearance
as the co-founder.

   Former baseball player Steve Garvey, involved in
paternity battles with two former lovers, has resigned as a
University of San Diego trustee.
   The private Catholic university released a short statement
Thursday confirming Garvey's resignation, but gave no reason for his
departure.
   Garvey was unavailable for comment, his receptionist said.
   Garvey, 40, a 10-time All Star who played first base for the Los
Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres during his 17-year career, last
week was named by two women as the father of their children.
   One baby was born Feb. 15 in San Diego to an unidentified woman.
Also claiming a pregnancy by Garvey is Rebecka Mendenhall of Atlanta.
   Garvey recently broke his engagement with Mendenhall and married
another woman. He has said he will accept financial responsibility
should either child prove to be his.

   Billionaire Donald Trump is once again being
picked on in a nationally syndicated cartoon strip.
   ``Bill the Cat,'' a frumpy feline featured in ``Bloom County,''
has acquired Trump's brain in the lastest series.
   Trump was asked about the transplant earlier this week.
   ``I've never heard of `Bloom County,''' he said, and asked what
the strip was about.
   The strip currently focuses on Bill, who got the transplanted
brain when Trump was crushed by an anchor of his yacht, the Trump
Princess.
   In recent weeks, Trump has expressed displeasure at being the
centerpiece of cartoonist Gary Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' strip.

   Elizabeth Taylor has confirmed she spent time in
the Betty Ford Clinic after suffering a back injury, the first time
the actress has publicly acknowledged her stay at the California
rehabilitation center.
   ``It has taken a long time to heal and even longer to learn to
live with it,'' Taylor said in a two-paragraph statement issued
Thursday. ``During this time I was in the Betty Ford Clinic for a
brief time ... and I am fine now!''
   Taylor, 57, said she suffered a compression fracture of the first
lumbar vertebra. But neither she nor her publicist would say if
prescription drugs for that injury put Taylor into the drug and
alcohol rehabilitation clinic.
   Tabloids had reported that Taylor had gone to the center last
year, but this was the actress' first public statement about it,
said publicist Lucinda Marshall.

   A judge has denied a request by the
ex-wife of Grammy Award-winning jazz saxophonist Stan Getz to have
his celebrity status considered marital property in their divorce
proceedings.
   In a decision made public Thursday, state Supreme Court Justice
Nicholas Colabella said Getz's status was worth little because of
his ill health.
   According to the court papers, Getz, 60, suffers from liver
cancer, lymphoma and cirrhosis of the liver.
   Getz's doctor testified that Getz probably has two years to live
and ``it is unlikely plaintiff will be able to pursue his livelihood
as a performer in any substantial way.''
   Getz was granted a divorce from Monica Getz, his wife of 31
years, after a trial in which the couple traded allegations of
adultery and abuse.
   Colabella ruled that Mrs. Getz did not sacrifice a medical career
to help her husband, as she testified, and that she was entitled
only to equal distribution of marital property, including the sale
of their $1.8 million Tarrytown estate and royalties due for Getz's
records.
   Getz is an artist in residence at Stanford University, receiving
$45,000 a year. He gained gold record status with his 1966 hit ``The
Girl from Ipanema.''
