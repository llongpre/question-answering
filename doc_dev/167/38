Cadogan finds grand houses for grand men in Atlanta

BUY A HOUSE in Atlanta, USA, and you can let it in 1996 when the Olympic
Games come to town. Splendid houses are for sale in the city, those in the
northern suburbs grand enough to excuse any chairman for moving his home and
his corporate headquarters to the thriving capital and air hub of the
south-eastern US.
Georgia began in 1733 when General Oglethorpe landed at Savannah, a place
where debtors were sent. The youngest and largest of the 13 states of the
original union, it was reluctant to secede from the Crown and in the civil
war looked for an alliance with Britain - an outlook mirrored in the
dominance of British styles in its grand houses.
In 1837 a town called Terminus was founded, becoming Marthasville in 1843
and Atlanta in 1845. Its position in the foothills at the south end of the
Appalachians made it the rail hub of the south east. General Sherman
destroyed this city in 1866 on his horrendous march 'from Atlanta to the
sea'.
When he stopped shelling, less than a tenth of the houses were intact. The
march to Savannah left a swathe of destruction 50 to 60 miles wide. His
attempt to annihilate the economy affected life in Georgia for years, and
southern memories for ever. But a pharmacist's cordial that became Coca-Cola
set Atlanta on the road to recovery.
By the 1920s, the money it brought the city was being spent on stately
homes, mostly English-style, in the area north of the city centre where the
battle of Peachtree Creek took place in the civil war. Today what is good
for Coke is still good for Atlanta.
Three clever architects led the mansion building between the wars, so
successfully that there are bus tours round these suburban palaces. Philip
Shutze (rhyming with gutsy), Neel Reid and Lewis Crook produced intelligent,
sharply detailed Tudor, Queen Anne or Georgian - and some French or
Italian-style - buildings with allusions to grand houses in Europe. They had
a good eye for siting. North Atlanta houses are in small wooded valleys with
creeks at the bottom, set well back from the road for privacy and security.
The large gardens are ablaze with azaleas and dogwood in the spring and in
autumn the 'man-made' woodland merges into the old natural forest so well
that you do not notice where one ends and the other begins.
It is suburbia, but at its best. Large, free-standing houses so close to
each other surprise Europeans who would expect each to be in its own park,
but their elegance and the beauty of the woods soon captivate. The property
market in Atlanta has been through a similar cycle to that in the UK. Prices
are well down from their 1987-88 peaks, realtor (estate agent) Harry Norman
said, as he has had to explain to vendors who would like their houses priced
at levels of five years ago. Unsurprisingly, some asking prices have been
cut. Where Atlanta differs from the UK is that, with the greater mobility of
the US workforce, there are plenty of good houses on the market.
Many have super-expensive kitchens with free-standing 'island' counters and,
attached to the master bedroom, jacuzzis - I have never seen so many before
 -mirrored dressing rooms and large clothes cupboards that are complete
rooms. Nowadays, an agent remarked, the money that in the past went on the
reception rooms is spent on these private rooms.
The chairman moving his corporate headquarters might like to buy an early
1920s Neel Reid house, 2 Vernon Road on offer from Harry Norman at Dollars
2.495m. It has splendid public rooms, a porch modelled on Gunston Hall, in
Virginia, a stepped garden leading to a creek, and swimming pool next to the
house.
To spend more, he could look at 65 Valley Road, a Tudor house in immaculate
condition on a very large lot (9.5 acres), with its swimming pool so deep in
the woods that you would never know you were in the middle of a great city.
Built for the third president of Coca-Cola, it is now the home of Edward and
Suzanne Elson, who must sell as President Bill Clinton has nominated him
ambassador to Denmark.
With a great hall, wood panelling, and painted vaulted ceilings, and
surrounded by azaleas, boxwood, dogwood and rhododendrons, the asking price
is Dollars 6.75m from Jenny Pruitt. Property tax in 1992 was Dollars 21,042.
It is hard to see how the ambassador's residence in Copenhagen can match it.
Cheaper, and with the comforting feel of not having been revamped - house
and fittings are 1930s - is 231 Peachtree Battle, for Dollars 1.25m from
Jenny Pruitt. Its pool is also next to the house. The garden is a treat,
planned as a series of rooms like Hidcote, in Gloucestershire, England,
(which of course an American, Lawrence Johnston, made) and with interesting
plants and a superb water garden around the creek at the bottom.
In 3645 Nancy Creek Road the white wood floored kitchen with reinforced
steel joists supporting the roof is like an exhibition pavilion. The pool
below is the other highlight. Also this house is a good example of extruded
mortar between the bricks, giving a rusticated texture that was news to me,
but is customary in Georgia. The price is Dollars 1.9m, and the agent Jenny
Pruitt. At the most expensive house 3640 Tuxedo Road (Dollars 9.5m from
Harry Norman) the old water garden, now overgrown, awaits resurrection. This
was once the house of Robert Woodruff, chairman of Coca Cola, sumptuous then
and made more sumptuous by the present owners. Five grand houses for five
chairmen or chief executive officers. If they buy next weekend, over the
Thanksgiving holiday, they will be in time to enjoy the Superbowl in Atlanta
in January.
