<LEADPARA>  Fifteen tons of sand doesn't make a beach. But the 18 groups that showed up
for the Sand Castles and Other Architectural Marvels Contest in Palo Alto knew
how to fake it. They pretended that the plaza in front of City Hall was
Malibu.;    Never mind that nature didn't cooperate. It drizzled on and off
Friday. Event organizers had contemplated cancellation earlier in the day.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     First Wimbledon, and now this. But the sky just pouted and never cried, so
the third-annual contest continued.;    The mondo speakers didn't blast the
Beach Boys or Jan and Dean. Instead, the Cowboy Junkies and Elvis Costello
serenaded contestants. But they seemed oblivious to the music. Sand-castle
building is serious business. Many design firms and architectural companies
entered. Some even brought blue prints for their creations. It was not exactly
kid stuff here.;    The kids were restricted to a couple of "community
sandboxes," where they seemed to have a heap more fun than the adults.;    The
adults were too busy to notice such trivial things as fun. They built
pyramids, Mayan temples, castles and dragons. One of the winners, Scale Models
Unlimited, built an elaborate zoo with caverns. Another group built a giant
hand holding a pencil. Another built a giant sandwich -- it looked yummy,
too.;    The most eloquent piece, undoubtedly, was Sam Smidt's Res Ipsa
Loquitur -- "The Thing Speaks for Itself." It depicted a football field, where
toy soldiers stood in a football formation. When designer Sam Smidt heard
about the sand castle contest, he thought, "Geez, this is really an
opportunity to make a social statement.";    He had heard from a friend that
more people watched the gulf war than the Superbowl. Thus, the inspiration for
the anti-war sand sculpture. Perhaps the piece, which won the greatest
architectural marvel award, will inspire more "statement" sand castles next
year.;    After the contest, the clean up was no fun. It took the city crew
most of the weekend to shovel the sand onto a tractor, said organizer Susan
Churcher. Then workers had to sweep the remaining grains off the plaza. The
drought prohibited the crew from using water to wash away the sand.;  MOVIE
MAGIC: The movies are one of the best ways to escape these hot days. One of
the best movie houses is the Stanford Theatre, where "Holiday" and "Bringing
Up Baby" are showing. Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. No need to say more.
The movies are shown at the Palo Alto movie palace through tomorrow.; GREEN NO
MORE: Naturalist Luis Tam has gone to the forests of Madagascar, and he's
brought back a bunch of slides. He will show the beautiful landscapes of the
southeastern African island, its animals, and the fragile remains of its rain
forests noon to 1 p.m. July 17 at the Peninsula Conservation Center, 2448
Watson Ct., Palo Alto. For details, call (415) 494-9301.  </TEXT>
