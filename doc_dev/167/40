   COMPANIES GEAR UP for the disability law, but many remain
confused.
   Although the Americans with Disabilities Act won't take
effect until next July, Meridian Bank of Reading, Pa., has
begun to make its teller machines wheelchair accessible.
"We're blending our plan for compliance with existing plans
we have for replacing obsolete and outdated equipment," says
Joseph S. Pendleton III, senior vice president, adding that
compliance may add $300,000 to the bill. The law bars
discrimination in the hiring and serving of the disabled.

   Embassy Suites Inc., Irving, Texas, has put roll-in
showers and devices like vibrating alarm clocks in some
rooms. Refurbishing costs may range between $10,000 for newer
hotels to $100,000 for olders ones, says Jim Van Allen, vice
president. Still, many companies are unclear about
compliance. In a July poll of 484 companies, 29% said they
were "uncertain" and 55% said they haven't started to plan
for the law, says New York law firm Jackson, Lewis,
Schnitzler &amp; Krupman, which conducted the poll.
   Embassy Suites also plans staff training in "disability
etiquette."
                                                                                                       

   LIBRARIES BORROW a not-for-profit strategy, and resort to
private money.
   While institutions like museums have long tapped private
purses, most libraries started doing so only recently. They
are prodded by dwindling public dollars -- which in New York
City has forced some branches for the first time to cut
services to three days a week -- and climbing costs of
computerization and books. But only 10% of the nation's
15,000 public libraries have formed fund-raising arms, most
in the last decade, the American Library Association says.
   Others need funds to help them fill gaps in social
services. "But you can't look to the city to provide
funding," says Elliot Shelkrot of the Free Library of
Philadelphia, which held a basketball contest to raise funds
for a youth outreach program. Private libraries aren't
immune. Cornell University math professors contribute
overtime pay so the math library won't have to reduce its
subscriptions. The Sidney, Mont., public library benefits
from a calf bingo: Where the calf makes a "deposit" on a
giant board determines the winner.
                                                                                                       

   TAX BREAKS can make a state appealing, but don't draw
European firms.
   Investment-hungry states would do better to foster
industry and education than devise tax incentives, admonishes
a KPMG Peat Marwick report on European investment in the U.S.
European-owned companies cite proximity to key industries,
suppliers and air transport as the top reason for choosing a
specific location. Lower taxes came in twelfth. The study
adds that European managers here find the quality of labor a
cause for worry.
   "They believe states do welcome foreign investment, so
local regulations don't present as much of a problem for
them," says KPMG's Pat Neil. But a separate Price Waterhouse
study warns that European companies weighing investment in
several states can find big differences in tax policies and
other regulations, which can be confusing. Nevertheless,
Europe accounts for over half of foreign investment here.
   Investment growth has slowed -- to 6% in 1990 from 16% in
1989, Commerce Department data show.
                                                                                                       

   END AROUND: A travel package sponsored by Jose Cuervo
Tequila gives fans a chance to watch January's Superbowl --
in Cancun, not Minneapolis, where the players will be. The
three-day excursion promises mariachi music, margaritas and,
yes, a giant screen on the beach so fans can tan and see the
game.
                                                                                                       

   EYE OF THE BEHOLDER: About 55% of annual report readers
who also own stock prefer well-prepared documents that don't
cost a lot of money, according to a survey by Bruskin
Associates, an Edison, N.J., market researcher. One out of
four say the reports can even be stapled photocopies.
                                                                                                       

   MOSCOW MBAS: University of Tulsa, Okla., is setting up a
graduate business school in a Moscow suburb. It will teach
Western business methods but "culturalized for the Russian
students," says Robert Hisrich, who teaches entrepreneurship.
                                                                                                       

   GREENBACKS: Recreational use of company tracts adds
dollars to the till.
   For a fee or a lease, more companies -- from paper makers
to insurers -- open large landholdings to hunters, fishermen
and others with a yearning for the great outdoors.
International Paper Co. manages, among others, a "black
powder hunt" in Arkansas, where hunters sport old weapons and
coonskin hats. It gets $10 million of revenue annually from
various leases on its 6.3 million acres of timberlands.
   Aquarion Co., which has public water and environmental
testing labs, issues up to 4,000 fishing permits a year for
four of its reservoirs in Connecticut. It isn't a moneymaker,
but earns good will, a spokesman says. The practice is
expected to spread because of growing demand for access to
recreational land, particularly in the East, where public
acreage is scarcer, says Dr. Steve Anderson, an Oklahoma
State University forestry associate professor.
   Calling it a "lucrative business," John Hancock Mutual
Life leases out 700,000 acres of timberlands.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: About 60 cyclists will pit their legpower against
a 90-year-old steam engine this Saturday in a 60-mile race
from the Grand Canyon to Williams, Ariz. Barring headwinds,
the cyclists are pegged to win. . . . New York's Drake Hotel
appoints a director of weddings and romance.

   THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT takes effect in July
1992 for employment provisions and in January 1992 for
provisions involving public services and public
accommodations. The dates weren't clear in the Business
Bulletin column in Thursday's edition.
