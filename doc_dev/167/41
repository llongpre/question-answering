   Fireworks and balloons filled Atlanta's morning
sky today when the International Olympic Committee announced the
city will be the site of the 1996 Summer Olympics.
   Pandemonium broke out at the downtown retail-entertainment
complex called Underground Atlanta, where thousands of people
gathered to watch the announcement over televisions broadcasting
the IOC meeting live from Tokyo.
   Bright orange and green fireworks lighted the sky even though
the sun had already risen when the news came about 7:50 a.m. The
boom of the fireworks could be heard throughout downtown.
   A band played the Olympic theme, and strangers hugged each
other.
   ``This was exciting. This was unbelievable,'' Mayor Maynard
Jackson said at a news conference in Tokyo just after the vote.
``This proves that if you don't run the race, you don't have a
chance to win.''
   ``It's not my victory, it's a victory for Atlanta,'' said former
Mayor Andrew Young, who helped lead the campaign for the Olympics.
``We have to thank God and pray that we are worthy and that all of
the things that we have said, we can make come true.'' He also was
in Tokyo.
   Atlanta entered the race late by most standards - in 1987 - with
nine volunteers. Some cities spent more money on the bids; for
example, Athens spent nearly $30 million compared with Atlanta's
$750,000. And some spent more time: Belgrade entered the race in
1985.
   To win, a city needed 44 votes from the 88-member IOC.
   The committee's choice basically came down to the history and
tradition of Athens or the 21st century stadiums, communications
and commercial appeal of its rivals, which also included Belgrade,
Yugoslavia; Manchester, England; Melbourne, Australia, and Toronto.
   According to a study done jointly by an accounting firm and the
University of Georgia, the Games would pump $3.5 billion over six
years into Georgia's economy, add 85,000 jobs and create global
exposure.
   ``It made me feel I was making the Olympic team again,'' said
Evander Holyfield, the former Olympic boxer who is from Atlanta.
   Seconds after the announcement, crowds in Atlanta were six-deep
at an Atlanta Organizing Committee cart selling T-shirts and hats
with the city's Olympic logo.
   In the minutes before the announcement, the crowd alternated
between nervous silence and good-natured jeers as IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch fumbled with the card holding the name of
the host city.
   ``I wanted this so bad,'' said Janice Stockard of suburban
Decatur. ``I wanted it because Atlanta's great. This means a lot.
We got the Superbowl (for 1994) and now we got the Olympics.''
   ``I am absolutely amazed. I can't believe Atlanta has gone from
a place nobody thought had a chance to really getting those
games,'' said Michael Lomax, chairman of the Fulton County
Commission.
   Afterward, many in the crowd headed for work, but others hung
around to scoop up the last remaining souvenirs and to get started
on an all-day party planned for Underground Atlanta.
