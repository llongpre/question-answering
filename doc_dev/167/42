   Dick Frymire's renowned rooster Ted
disgraced himself on national television when he predicted
Cincinnati to win the Super Bowl. But he's not quitting and should
have his picks for top 10 TV shows ready soon.
   ``I tell everybody that Ted is the most famous unfried chicken in
the world today,'' says Frymire, who has a regional radio show
telling yarns about Ted and offering folklore and advice on
everything from getting rid of roaches and squirrels to calming a
crying baby.
   For the TV picks, Frymire will put the names of about 50 shows in
front of Ted and place a kernel of corn in front of each sign. The
first grain of corn Ted eats will be his choice of the No. 1 show,
with picks up to 10.
   Maybe that'll work out better than his Superbowl prediction,
which was made on national television, on CBS' ``Sunday Morning.''
   It all started in 1984 when Frymire put his pet into a pen shaded
with two old campaign posters, one of Ronald Reagan and the other of
Walter Mondale. He set out some numbers and corn kernels, and asked
Ted how many states Mondale would carry in the election.
   Ted ate the kernel in front of the number ``1.''
   ``I'm the biggest Democrat that ever was,'' Frymire said. ``And I
thought, `The chicken's gone Republican on me for sure.'''
   Since then, Ted has predicted winners of basketball games, the
Kentucky Derby and three Super Bowl games.

   After 18 years of catering to jet-setting
socialites, the exclusive Faces discotheque on the Rush Street night
life strip near downtown has gone out with a bang.
   Owner George Shales threw a last-look party for the club's 16,000
card-carrying members Friday night, and invited the public.
   Jim Kurianowicz, 42, who worked as a bartender there, lamented
changes he said helped lead to the closing of Faces.
   ``When it opened, Rush Street was like Vegas,'' Kurianowicz said.
``Now, the landmarks are gone. It's all executives, high-rises and
yuppies.''
   And the rent has gone from $2,500 a month to $14,000, Shales said.
   Customers during the early days became lifetime members for $50,
when video monitors flashed scenes from ``Charlie's Angels,'' and
the singles crowd rocked to quadrophonic sound.
   ``I used to come here when I was a bachelor. I knew all the
dances then, the hustle, the bump. I was pretty good,'' said Logan
Dugaw, of suburban LaGrange. He's now 45, and has five children.

   They only had a week to do it, but an army
of offspring was enough to build a new house for 86-year-old Evan
Smith, replacing his fire-damaged homestead.
   His old house burned Jan. 7. He moved in with a daughter,
Patricia Smith, but yearned for a place of his own, she said.
   So his son, Jerry Smith, who is in the construction business in
Piedmont, S.C., proposed using his dad's insurance proceeds to build
a new house during his one-week vacation.
   ``I personally didn't think we could do it, but we did,'' Ms.
Smith said Saturday from this northeastern Arkansas town of 49
residents.
   ``With all of us together, we have the ability,'' Jerry Smith
said.
   The construction crew consisted of ``grandkids and
great-grandkids and brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law,'' Ms. Smith
said.
   ``We had everybody's cooperation _ we had to, to get this all
done in this length of time. We have really pitched in. When we
started, oh, Lord, we had 25 folks out there helping,'' she said.
``It is a labor of love. I don't know what else you'd call it.''
