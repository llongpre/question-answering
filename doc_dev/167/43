   After years of being considered the little
sibling of broadcast television, some say the cable TV industry is
beginning to look more like Goliath than David.
   Cable TV, now watched by more than 50 percent of all American
households, has become a $12 billion industry that is gaining
viewers steadily, mostly at the expense of the broadcast networks.
   But with prosperity comes increased scrutiny, and in cable's
case Congress has been raising questions about concentration of
ownership within the industry, complaints of poor service and
rising rates. Some in Congress say it may be time to reregulate
cable TV.
   ``We have to pay attention to this,'' James P. Mooney, president
of the National Cable Television Association, told an audience at
the opening session of the group's annual convention Sunday.
   ``We can't rebuff our friends,'' he said. ``An important part of
good business is good politics.''
   More than 13,000 people are expected to attend the convention,
which runs through Tuesday.
   Most governmental regulation has been lifted from the industry.
The most recent deregulation came in January 1987 when most cable
systems were freed of municipal rate control. They now have more
control than ever on what viewers see and how much they pay.
   Deregulation brought increases in rates. The industry says the
average subscriber's bill rose 6.7 percent in the first six months
after price control was lifted, but critics in Congress cite
instances of rates going up by as much as 400 percent in some
systems.
   Despite the increase, subscribers continued to sign on. Cable
systems added more than 4 million subscribers in 1987, putting the
percentage of households receiving cable to nearly 52 percent _
about 45 million households.
   Now that many cable companies have finished building their
systems _ wiring more than 80 percent of the nation's households _
cable companies are starting to pay off their debt and are putting
their cash into programming.
   ``Programming is going to drive penetration,'' said James S.
Cownie, president of Heritage Communications of Des Moines, Iowa,
and NCTA chairman.
   ``That's going to move us up to the 70 percent saturation level
from 52 percent where we are now.''
   The industry has been encouraged by the success of its early
efforts, like Showtime's ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' a comedy
series now on Fox Broadcasting Co.
   The show is one of only a few that have moved from cable to
broadcast. Most of the migration is still from broadcast to cable,
which has become home to many an old syndicated rerun.
   But cable executives say that will change as cable systems pour
more money into developing their own programs.
   ``We should be more concerned with what the content will be than
where it comes from,'' said Michael S. Fuchs, chairman of Home Box
Office.
   HBO received praise for its recent program ``Dear America:
Letters Home from Vietnam.''
   Cable TV, particularly the Entertainment and Sports Programming
Network, ESPN, also has been landing some big sports contracts.
Exclusive cable contracts for big sports events, though, have been
criticized for denying viewing of these games to those who don't
subscribe to cable. Before cable came along, these games could be
seen free on broadcast TV.
   But cable is likely to continue its foray into sports
programming.
   ``There are more first run movies and sports on cable, and
that's going to continue,'' said Fuchs. ``The only things that will
get some protection (from cable-exclusive contracts) are big sports
events like the Superbowl.''
