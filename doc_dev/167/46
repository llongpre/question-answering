<LEADPARA>  THERE IS grumbling amid the scribbling set about the endless stream of
homecoming parades for Desert Storm vets. It has been pointed out that the
celebrations are lasting longer than the war.;    One critic sees the hype and
the hoopla as "warnography," i.e., "the glorification of war, warriors and war
machines" and "excessive wallowing in glee over a military victory." The more
easily alarmed see a helium-filled M-1 tank, a papier-mache Patriot float by
and feel a wave of militarism sweeping the country.  </LEADPARA>

IT BEATS RAPE AND PILLAGE AS A VICTORY CELEBRATION  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     To which I say: Loosen up, guys. Historically, the reward for victorious
armies is the conquered country, theirs for rape and pillage and general
mayhem. Indeed, this style is not just historical. It is how most winners
still do it. It is how Iraqis do it (in Kuwait and Kurdistan), how Liberians
do it, how Ethiopians will be doing it.;    Americans don't do it that way
anymore, at least not since Sherman's march (described by James McPherson as
"a frolic, a moving feast" and by a Union officer as "the most gigantic
pleasure excursion ever planned"). What do we now offer soldiers who have just
spent seven harrowing months risking their lives on our behalf? A ride in an
open car preceded not by slaves in chains but by pink-cheeked cheerleaders
flashing pom-poms.;    This is militarism? Somehow, I don't think this is how
the Prussians did it. Moreover, part of the merriment has a serious purpose:
expiation for our shabby treatment of Vietnam vets. The parades in Chicago,
Hollywood and elsewhere were explicitly open to all veterans as a way of
including Vietnam vets in a genuinely feelgood event. Including the soldiers
of a lost war in the rah-rah turns a celebration of victory into a homage to
sacrifice.;    But even where it is a celebration of victory, why not?;   
What happened in Kuwait was an extraordinary military victory. The critics now
sneering that Iraq was an overestimated pushover are, by and large, the same
group that six months ago were warning that Iraq was a fearsome powerhouse,
Saddam a wily general, and our desert army his next victim. Yesterday they
said Kuwait was going to be Vietnam. Now they say it was Grenada all along.;  
 In fact, the United States and its allies defeated a formidable force that
had just spent eight years holding off and then subduing an enemy (Iran) three
times its size. When a nation scores the second most stunning military victory
of the century (after the Six Day War), it has every right to celebrate.;   
What are the critics so lathered up about? Triumphalism? The Romans knew how
to put on a triumph: The general wore a golden crown, the enemy marched in
chains and wagons of booty brought up the rear. Today's endlessly televised,
absurdly choreographed Hollywood parades given to patriotic crooning by
second-string soap stars are not triumphs.;    America's genius, on display at
every wacky welcome-home TV special -- in one parade, Martha Raye waved her
false teeth to the crowd -- is not militarism but show biz. This isn't Triumph
of the Will. This is Gilligan's Island.;    America is a cultural Cuisinart,
taking anything of taste and distinction and turning it to mush. Our great
national talent is not glorifying but trivializing. It is hard to get agitated
about extravagant parades during a week when Henry Kissinger plays guest
weatherman on the CBS morning show. This is a country whose former speaker of
the House pops out of suitcases in TV ads. This, after all, is the land of the
Superbowl, a national festival of excess.;    Glorification? Two months ago,
Norman Schwarzkopf was the greatest American war hero since Ike. Today he is
grand marshal of the Kentucky Derby Festival Parade. In between, he has been
made to chat with Barbara Walters, link arms with Mickey Mouse and become
honorary knight of Elizabeth II of England. Next, the Indy 500. In most
countries, a court-martialed corporal can expect more leniency.;    Director
Billy Wilder once came to Sam Goldwyn with the idea of doing a biography of
Nijinsky. Goldwyn said he was not about to invest in a movie about a man who
had ended up in a mental institution believing he was a horse. "Not to worry,"
said Wilder. "My version will have a happy ending. We wind up showing him
winning the Kentucky Derby.";    Subtlety is not our strong suit. Hence
Wilder's dictum on subtlety in movies: "Of course, there must be subtleties.
Just make sure you make them obvious.";    We always do. Obviousness is the
ultimate American vice, and, as national failings go, a small one. So relax:
Raise a glass, tip a hat, wave a pom-pom to the heroes of Desert Storm. If
that makes you feel you're living in Sparta, have another glass.  </TEXT>
