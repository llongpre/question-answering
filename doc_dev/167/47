   President Reagan shed a symbolic burden at the
Moscow summit that he had carried for five years _ his own
description of the Kremlin as an ``evil empire.''
   It was a remark that Reagan had uttered only once, but it had
burned in the Soviet consciousness since 1983, an oft-quoted and
inescapable reminder of superpower tensions. Finally, to the private
delight of White House officials, it was gone.
   ``That was a different time, a different era,'' Reagan said,
standing on the cobblestones of Red Square alongside Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the architect of ambitious social and economic changes
that the United States wants to encourage.
   Reagan's repudiation bolstered the already-improved ties between
the United States and Soviet Union and cleared the stage for another
president to move in next January to manage superpower relations,
unfettered by the rhetorical extremes of his predecessor.
   Gorbachev took immense satisfaction in Reagan's retraction. He
quoted a Greek philosopher as saying, ``Everything flows, everything
changes.''
   Indeed, the word ``change'' is an understatement for what has
happened in the remarkable 30-month summit relationship of Reagan
and Gorbachev.
   The two superpowers, owners of the world's deadliest arsenals of
nuclear weapons, have made a dramatic leap, from open hostility and
isolation to warmth and frequent contacts at the highest level.
   Make no mistake, there still are deep differences. The
superpowers are deadlocked over terms of a strategic arms reduction
treaty (START), and Gorbachev bridled at Reagan's lectures about
human rights in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet leader said that the Kremlin ``will not accept any
advice on how to run our affairs. We do not need anyone else's
model. We do not need anyone else's values.''
   Yet, things are different.
   Since the first Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in 1985, superpower
summitry has become so routine that White House officials are not
embarrassed by the fact that the latest meeting did not produce any
breakthroughs or concrete achievements.
   ``We can't give you a Superbowl game every couple of weeks or
months,'' said Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the president's national
security adviser.
   ``We have to take this slowly, this is too important to rush,''
Powell said. ``In the next six months, the next six years, if you
don't come home with a (START) treaty that the experts, the
Congress, don't see as strong ... it'll never be ratified.''
   There is little likelihood a START treaty will be concluded under
Reagan.
   With time running out on his administration, the negotiators will
not return to Geneva until July 12 to resume negotiations.
   ``We set no deadline,'' Reagan said. ``You don't make a treaty
just to simply have it be achieved at a certain point in time.''
   However, Powell, talking with reporters on Air Force One as
Reagan flew back to Washington, said U.S.-Soviet relations now are
``solidly in place without a lot of ups and downs, without too many
sharp turns that cause people to have anxiety. It is a fairly
stable, maturing, growing relationship.''
   To underscore his point, Powell noted that Secretary of State
George P. Shultz has had something like 26 meetings with his Soviet
counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze.
   In the absence of concrete achievements, White House officials
said Reagan's real accomplishments were his appearances before
Soviet students, intellectuals, dissidents, writers and monks at the
Danilov monastery. He argued for greater freedom for the Soviet
people and respect for human rights.
   ``I submit to you that that is real substance,'' Powell said.
``When you can take that kind of message directly to the people of
the Soviet Union in the person of the president of the United
States, that goes well beyond form, that goes well beyond style.
That is substance.''
   Yevgeny Yevtushenko, a well-known Soviet poet, emphasized the
symbolic importance of Reagan's appearances.
   ``Mr. Reagan doesn't belong to the kind of intellectual elite. He
represents the ordinary American people, he speaks for the silent
majority,'' Yevtushenko said in Moscow last week.
   ``If he takes the first step into the Kremlin, it was the
so-called American people _ they made the step, too,'' Yevtushenko
said.
   The summit appeared to be an exhausting experience for the
77-year-old Reagan.
   He acknowledged he returned home tired, but said he was
exhilarated. ``The events of this week in Moscow were momentous. Not
conclusive, perhaps, but momentous,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan, who refused to meet with Gorbachev's three predecessors,
attributed most of the evolution in U.S.-Soviet relations to
Gorbachev, a leader who, the president said, is ``a serious man,
seeking serious reform.''
   Reagan also said in a speech in London that the West should
``embrace honest change when it occurs, but let us also be wary and
ever vigilant.''
   That responsibility soon will be passed to Democrat Michael
Dukakis or Republican George Bush, whoever wins the presidential
election in November.
   ``I think it's a relationship that will be built on by the next
administration, regardless of which party wins the election,''
Powell said.
   He said that Moscow will continue working actively with Reagan,
``But at the same time, it would be not smart of them not to begin
thinking about the next administration. It also would be not awfully
responsible of us not to begin preparing them for the next president.
   ``As we get later into the year,'' Powell said, ``we'll start to
do our own transition activities to the next president ... to make
sure that this relationship, this transition (occurs) in a smooth,
satisfactory way.''
