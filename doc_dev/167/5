The Pendragons are more than familiar with David Copperfield. As magic's top 
gun, Copperfield is the guy who fills arenas, does TV specials and is known for 
splashy, sometimes schmaltzy and almost always amazing tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Other illusionists routinely face performing in his shadow, including the 
Pendragons. But Jonathan and Charlotte, the former UC Irvine students turned 
husband-and-wife magic team, found more of the spotlight recently when they 
were named Best Illusionists in the International Magic Awards -- over 
Copperfield and several other performers. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat him!" Jonathan Pendragon said during a telephone interview from Las 
Vegas, where the couple were performing at the Aladdin hotel and casino. "I was 
excited, it's kind of amazing -- sort of like David and Goliath or Jack and the 
Giant Killer. 
</P>
<P>
"David (Copperfield) is visual and spectacular, but I think (the judges) were 
more interested in tradition. We like to keep it more straight, less 
sensational. The contest reflected, I think, more of a purist attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour-long competition, with categories including entertainers of the 
year (won by Las Vegas regulars Siegfried and Roy), best close-up performer, 
comedy magician, escape artist and technical magician (Copperfield did win this 
one), is scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11. Winning 
routines, including the Pendragons' "Interlude" and "Metamorphosis," will be 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
Although reluctant to describe the illusions specifically, Pendragon said that 
Charlotte "appears to come through my chest" in "Interlude," while 
"Metamorphosis" involves "a rapid escape." 
</P>
<P>
Pendragon pointed out that both feats are typical of their approach, which 
involves a physical style utilizing his gymnastic and diving training (he's 
competed on the college level) and Charlotte's experience as a dancer, gymnast 
and body builder (she was runner-up in the 1982 Body Building Superbowl 
contest). 
</P>
<P>
They avoid the gaudy costumes ("We hate rhinestones," he said) and the more 
traditional tuxedo garb ("It's too restrictive for the way we perform") favored 
by most magicians. Instead, they rely on scant, monotone outfits that allow 
movement and emphasize their physiques. 
</P>
<P>
Agility and quickness are integral to the act, which features levitations, 
disappearances and escapes, a Pendragon trademark. He said they hold the record 
for an escape from a locked trunk popularized by Harry Houdini, who did it in 
seven seconds. Pendragon does it in three. 
</P>
<P>
"There's drama in that because everyone is usually amazed when we accomplish it 
so soon. We combine our physical presence with an acting presence to create a 
style that adds to the illusions. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the rapidity is not purely for the sake of speed . . . a real 
magician would not stall; he would simply wave his hand and the magic would 
happen. As an actor, I try to make my magic look as real as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The Pendragons met in the late '70s while attending UCI, where Charlotte was 
studying dance, among other things, and Jonathan pursued drama. He was also 
performing solo in local and Los Angeles clubs as a magician, when not 
moonlighting as a Hollywood stuntman (he's doubled for Burgess Meredith and 
John Belushi, among others). Charlotte, too, was a double, having appeared on 
"Charlie's Angels" and "Quincy, M.E." They started dating, and eventually he 
asked her to take part in his act. 
</P>
<P>
At first, they offered the basics, using "manipulation and other standard 
tricks" but soon turned to a more physical style to set them apart. He also 
wanted to make Charlotte more than a pretty assistant and began building a 
routine around their equal partnership. 
</P>
<P>
They progressed rapidly. Although they haven't achieved the household fame of 
Copperfield and, before him, Doug Henning, the Pendragons are reasonably 
well-known among magic fans. Their work in Las Vegas, the acknowledged mecca 
for working magicians, the past few years and various appearances on television 
underscores that. 
</P>
<P>
In talking about magic, Pendragon is apt to get a little philosophical, 
referring to its "preternatural" beauty and ability to be "intellectually 
puzzling." Artistry and sound technique add up to good magic, which comes down 
to "telling a story and tapping into the kid in us." 
</P>
<P>
After a pause, he added that the best illusion "when performed expertly and 
with imagination can instill those lost feelings of youth and wonder that are 
rare and thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
 "The International Magic Awards," featuring the Pendragons, is scheduled to 
air Monday at 8 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11.
