A new American football year opens tomorrow, but if there was a prize for
the best performance during the off-season, the National Football League
would have crowned its champions already: the San Francisco 49ers.
Not because the 49ers had the best pre-season record. They won three out of
four games, but two teams, the Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts, went
undefeated in exhibition games.
But because of the team management's accomplishment in adding a formidable
group of talented veterans to one of the most highly-paid rosters in the
sport while keeping the payroll under the limit imposed by the NFL's new
salary cap.
The salary cap is the cause of the US professional baseball players' strike.
Unlike their counterparts in football, baseball players are not prepared to
accept a limit on their pay. The NFL players' union last year accepted a
ceiling on the total each team could pay its players in return for securing
free agency - which allows players to move teams after a certain period in
the league.
The difference between the NFL's salary cap and the cap proposed by the
baseball owners, is the flexibility of the NFL system. There is a lot of
'wiggle room' under the football cap, and no one has proved more adept at
wiggling than the 49ers.
At the end of last year, the team's total payroll exceeded Dollars 40m. It
seemed that they had to reduce salaries and / or shed players to fit under
the Dollars 34.6m (Pounds 22m) cap the NFL had set for the 1994 season.
Today, however, the 49ers have all their top players from last year on
long-term contracts, including stars such as quarterback Steve Young and
wide receiver Jerry Rice. And they have five new players, each an
established NFL star - on extended contracts. Yet the 49ers team payroll has
dropped from more than Dollars 40m to Dollars 34.59m, just under the salary
cap.
How did they do it? They started late last year by hurriedly signing several
key players to lucrative 'front-loaded' long-term contracts, which paid the
players a lot of money for the 1993 season, and considerably less for
subsequent ones. By paying out so much money in 1993, before the cap came
into effect, the 49ers left themselves considerable room to sign new players
for 1994, year-one of the salary cap.
In basketball - the other sport with an existing salary cap - teams have
fallen foul of the league authorities with this kind of creative accounting,
but in football, the wiggle room leaves plenty of scope for creativity. As
Carmen Policy, president of the 49ers, put it: 'We wanted to be the hunters,
not the hunted. We wanted to do what we could to manipulate the system,
rather than have it control us.'
After anchoring many of their best players to the team, the 49ers went
hunting. They bagged several top free agents, including Super Bowl winners
Ken Norton of the Dallas Cowboys and Richard Dent of the Chicago Bears, and
veterans Rickey Jackson of the New Orleans Saints and Bart Oates of the New
York Giants. It was no coincidence that all of the new signings were
defenders, for the defence has been the chief weakness of the
attack-oriented 49ers for the past few seasons.
Some of the money needed to pay the newcomers came from the release of
well-paid reserve players, including Steve Bono, the back-up quarterback who
so often deputised for injured stars such as Joe Montana and Steve Young.
Also, the 49ers chose to hire a lot of relatively cheap 'rookie' players
fresh from university teams.
The result is a well-balanced team, a favourite to reach the Super Bowl in
January. The only likely obstacle is the defending champions, the Cowboys,
who beat the 49ers in the last two National Football Conference finals. The
Cowboys, however, have lost their coach, Jimmy Johnson and several leading
players including Norton.
Yet, the 49ers' policy of squeezing so much expensive talent under the
salary cap involves a risk. Because the 49ers have let go so many veteran
reserves and replaced them with mostly untested players, a team that was
once renowned for its 'depth' now has little insurance if its stars get
injured. And in the NFL, that is quite a gamble.
