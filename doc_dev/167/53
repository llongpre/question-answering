Three years ago Panos Eliades had never been at a boxing match. Two years
ago the Greek-Cypriot accountant would never have dreamt of flying to Las
Vegas to watch Evander Holyfield regain the world heavyweight title from
Riddick Bowe. Last month Eliades scarcely batted an eyelid when a deranged
parachutist missed him by inches and landed in the ring during the Ceasar's
Palace title fight.
After a couple of years as the backer and financial manager of World Boxing
Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, almost nothing surprises a man
whose day-to-day business as one of London's biggest insolvency
practitioners makes him not unfamiliar with human vagaries.
'My accountancy colleagues couldn't believe I'd ended up being involved with
boxing. You've normally got to be a semi-hoodlum cum ruffian to have the
credentials to be a boxing promoter,' chuckled Eliades in the partnership's
offices, an elegant Bloomsbury townhouse.
However unconventional his hobby, like the rest of his profession, Eliades
can add up. He is deep in negotiations to mount a Holyfield / Lewis fight
next spring. It would be a heavyweight watershed, unifying the World Boxing
Association and International Boxing Federation belts held by Holyfield with
the WBC crown held by Lewis.
It has the potential to be the richest bout in boxing's history. In sporting
dollars it is a Superbowl. MGM are pitching hard for the fight to mark the
March opening of its new hotel / casino complex. Its gaming area, wider than
a 15-lane highway, will be the biggest in Las Vegas, and is expected to
gross Dollars 305m (Pounds 205m) in the first year of operation.
'The Unification fight could be worth as much as Dollars 54m,' calculated
Eliades. The final values will depend on pay-per-view income from the HBO
cable tv network, but Lewis would be guaranteed Dollars 10m, with Holyfield
earning 50 per cent more.
As a co-promoter Eliades would be looking for a profit on the event and, as
manager, 30 per cent of Lewis's purse - before expenses such as training
camp, air fares and hotel bills. 'Don't just look at one fight. There could
be three in a year and then you're looking at Dollars 15m annual gross
profit which is good for any small business,' Eliades enthused. 'The figures
in boxing are just enormous.
'Tyson is coming out of jail in 18 months. If Lennox can fight him whilst
holding three belts, it will be the biggest ever . . . . Dollars 100m. Even
the the nuns will watch that one.'
Of course, one of the fascinations of boxing is the difficulty of getting
even the most obviously desirable fight to the ring. Before the Holyfield /
Bowe fight could happen a contender named Michael Moorer with a contract to
fight Holyfield had to be paid Dollars 1.5m to step aside. It could cost
treble that to make Moorer step aside a second time.
There is also the sub-plot of one Michael Bentt. A first-round straight
right to the jaw of Tommy Morrison on an October night in Tulsa earned Bentt
the cardboard crown of the World Boxing Organisation's heavyweight title.
Bentt was born in the south London suburb of Dulwich before moving to
Jamaica aged six.
With Lewis being British-born and London-based, the tabloid sports pages
will soon be shrieking for an all-British 'unification fight'. After not
having a heavyweight champion for a century, the land of the Marquess of
Queensberry now has two.
The painstaking human embroidery of making the deals is down to Eliades. 'A
lot of boxing deals are never completed because the ego of the individual
gets in the way. They are unqualified megalomaniacs,' he said, with the
disarming frankness which has made him a breath of fresh air in boxing.
'There are disc jockeys acting as boxing promoters. I work on a handshake.
People in the fight game say I'm mad. In boxing you can't even rely on a
contract, let alone a handshake.'
How, then, did such an innocent abroad find himself in such a position? As
Eliades himself agrees, one has more chance of being struck by lightning
than of 'owning' a British world heavyweight champion.
Lewis was brought to Britain from his then home in Canada under an
arrangement and contract instigated by financier Roger Levitt, recently
convicted of a multi-million pound City fraud. Eliades was a neighbour and
business acquaintance of Levitt.
'Levitt is one of the greatest salesmen you could find. Sand to the Arabs. I
knew nothing about boxing, I'd never been to a fight. I wouldn't recommend
it as a business venture to any client of mine and I didn't want to buy the
contract. But I did, as a favour to Roger, who desperately needed out.'
Eliades calculated his initial exposure at Pounds 200,000. By the time Lewis
fought Razor Ruddock at Earls Court a year ago, the sum had swelled to
Pounds 1.6m. 'I'll never forget it when Lennox knocked him out in the second
round, I knew we were on the road to financial recovery,' he said.
'Being a liquidator / receiver, my job is to be pessimistic, not optimistic.
I'm pleased to recover my outlay. Profit doesn't usually come into it. With
hindsight it's been a fantastic investment but somebody up there must like
me to let it turn out like this.'
The boxer and the accountant make an unlikely pair, not least because Lewis
is a foot taller than the diminutive Eliades. But it seems to work.
'When he steps out of line, he gets a slapping,' confides Eliades, tongue in
cheek. 'Being world heavyweight champion sometimes he wants things done
yesterday, but he's only a normal human being as far as I'm concerned.
'All this yes-champ, no-champ is the end. It did for Tyson and a lot of
others in the past. When you earn Dollars 10m in one night its easy to start
drifting away from reality.'
One project the pair are committed to is a commercially-funded and run
London school for inner-city teenagers who have been in trouble with police
and other authorities. Team Solo will have pupils' fees paid by local
authorities. Lewis hopes to spend around a day a week at the Hackney
premises, which open next spring.
'We hope to make money from it but that's far from the only reason,' said
Eliades. 'Most of these kids in trouble are black and many lack any kind of
role model. Lennox hopes to provide that.'
If he makes it past Holyfield next spring, Lennox Lewis will be in many ways
a unique world heavyweight champion. British, preferring chess to night
clubs, takes his Mum to training camp with him, and a manager whose cheques
arrive on time. Boxing will never be the same again.
