RECENT New York Knicks' basketball games at Madison Square Garden have been
a bit like a night at the Oscars, so hungry has Hollywood-on-the-Hudson been
to associate itself with the best sports story in town.
In recent weeks, Jack, Dusty, Woody, Spike and Arnold have all been there,
tasting the special atmosphere that New York generates every time it looks
as if one of the city's teams is on the verge of greatness. When the
baseball Mets won the World Series in 1986, New York went berserk, as it did
the last time the Knicks won a championship, in 1973.
Yet since the mid-1980s, New York sports fans have had little to cheer. The
football Giants won the SuperBowl in 1991, but the title was earned against
the backdrop of the Gulf War, so celebrations were muted.
This year, however, the Knicks have captured the city's imagination. In the
regular season they won 60 of their 82 games, ending with the second best
record in the 27-team National Basketball Association.
To success-starved New Yorkers, the Knicks' performance has been especially
gratifying because it was only two years ago that the team seemed mired in
mediocrity.
In 1991 they scraped into the playoffs, only to go out at the first attempt
to the Chicago Bulls in three straight games. That poor effort disgusted the
fans and the local media. The season ended in complete disarray. The coach
lacked the support of his team and the Knicks' only star, Patrick Ewing,
wanted to escape New York.
Yet, just two years later, the Knicks are fancied to reach the play-off
finals. They have beaten the Indiana Pacers in the first round and start
their second-round series against the Charlotte Hornets tomorrow.
Much of the credit for the Knicks' renaissance must go to Pat Riley, the
team's coach. In the 1980s Riley coached the Los Angeles Lakers to five NBA
titles, but when he joined the Knicks at the start of the 1991-92 season
there were many who still believed he had not proved himself.
Critics argued that the Lakers were so good that it did not matter who
coached them. They said that a team led by legends like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
and Earvin 'Magic' Johnson would have won five championships if they had
been coached by Michael Jackson. In the Knicks, Riley saw an opportunity to
win the respect that was denied him in California.
Today, Riley has triumphed, and with a team that could not be more different
to his title-winners of the 1980s. The Lakers dominated through deft
ball-handling and passing, and swift counter-attacks. They were adored by
their fans in Los Angeles, who liked to think that the team played the game
the way they lived - creative, fast and loose.
The Knicks' have won the hearts of their city because their approach meshes
closely with New Yorkers' image of themselves - hardworking, tough and
uncompromising.
Above all, the Knicks' game is built around big men, aggressive defending,
and an intimidating attitude that occasionally borders on thuggery.
Their bruising style has made the Knicks the most feared team in the league,
and hugely popular in New York. It is not surprising that the fans'
favourites this year have been Anthony Mason and John Starks, two ferocious
competitors whose intensely physical play causes havoc when they defend, and
creates scoring opportunities when the ball moves up court.
The dark side of streetfighters like Mason and Starks sometimes surfaces.
The Knicks' have a poor disciplinary record. On Tuesday Starks was thrown
out of a play-off game for head-butting Reggie Miller of the Pacers.
The other New York weapons include the dominant presence under the basket
and the accurate shooting (especially under pressure) of Ewing, the canny
generalship of point guard Doc Rivers and the strongest substitutes' bench
in the NBA. Add Riley's long experience of post-season play, and the Knicks
look as if they have the ingredients for a championship.
Yet, over such a long haul - the playoffs do not end until June and the
final three rounds involve a best-of-seven series - it may come down to
which team is hungriest for the title.
After consecutive championships, Chicago's appetite may be sated. The best
teams in the western division - Phoenix and Seattle - have the talent, but
there are doubts over their willingness to mix it up with the toughest teams
from the east.
Furthermore, the Knicks are desperate to win. Ewing, who has won national
college championships and Olympic gold, has said he will not feel fulfilled
until he wins an NBA title. Veterans such as Rolando Blackman and Rivers
know this may be their last shot at glory, and Riley wants to prove he can
win it all with a team other than the Lakers.
As for Mason and Starks, they have reached the top the hard way - via the
basketball wilderness of semi-professional leagues, obscure European
leagues, and no-hope 10-day contracts with losing NBA teams. As Starks said
recently: 'Remember, I wasn't supposed to be in the pros. But once I got a
taste, I knew it was just a matter of time.'
