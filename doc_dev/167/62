<F P=106> [Report on interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio </F>
Berlusconi by Vittorio Zucconi in Arcore; date not given: "How 
I Want To Govern Italy"] 
  [Excerpt] Arcore -- [Passage omitted] Who made you do this, 
Doctor Berlusconi? What demons forced you to leave your villa 
in Arcore and enter the fray with [Northern League Secretary] 
Bossi, [National Alliance leader] Fini, [Democratic Party of the 
Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto, and [Pact for Italy leader] 
Segni? "Love for my country. I realized as far back as last 
summer that I had to decide, when the new electoral law handing 
Italy over to the politicians of the Left was passed, a Left 
which pretends to be liberal but which carries within the 
inextirpable kernel of economic planning and statism. The 
center was in pieces, the Right was in tatters, I attempted in 
vain to convince them to come to an agreement, to form a team. 
I picked up their forces, and within three months I had created 
a party from zero, and put together 400 candidates; I organized 
the electoral campaign and I said to myself: My life as an 
entrepreneur, as an industrialist, is finished. One phase of my 
existence has come to an end, and another one is beginning, that 
of politics. I am ready to sell my shares, if buyers can be 
found in this difficult market, providing that the work and 
faithfulness of those who have followed me is rewarded." Sell 
everything, really sell? "I am ready to go even beyond American 
standards. My life as an entrepreneur is coming to an end. I am 
in the political world. I have overcome the first hurdle, and 
there is still a lot to do. I also want to convince everyone 
who said that I was mad." 
  Away from the rows of factories, condominiums, sham country 
cottages, and motorway turn-offs, from Berlusconi's villa the 
Alps appear extremely close and the dust of politics a very long 
way off. But it is only a mirage, because the bites of Bossi, 
whom he calls ("do not write it," but I do write it, be patient, 
it is too beautiful) "dangerous and unpredictable as a wounded 
boar," are strong. And the shadow of those young people's 
fascist salutes following the victory weigh on him. "I know, 
certain gestures and Fini's praises of Mussolini as a statesman 
have made a bad impression, in particular abroad, and I am aware 
that there is a lot of work to do. But a general has to make 
war with the troops which he has, and I have no doubts about 
Fini. His liberal choices are clear and have been made, his 
path toward liberalism and freedom has been a genuine path. And 
I am ready to guarantee this, I who am balance, moderation, and 
measure personified. There is no, and I say, no getting away 
from this choice of balance and moderation. This should be 
clear, also abroad." 
  But, on the other hand, it is not clear indeed where the 
promise of a stable, strong government, double quick, is going 
to end, now that relationships between yesterday's allies have 
become those between the hunter and the wounded boar. "Bossi 
will do what he wants. Outside the alliance with me and Fini 
there is nothing for him, and he knows it. He certainly knew it 
a short time ago when, at the house of my friend [Fininvest 
chairman] Fedele Confalonieri we lifted our champagne glasses 
together to toast the new government program. I am speaking 
clearly: If I am given the task, I will form the government. 
If it is not a majority, we will vote again, and we will count 
the votes...." Whose votes, and with whom? "For example, with 
the votes of the moderate Catholics, now that the Church has 
recognized my center role." And why should not the other 
parties attempt to form a different majority? "Oh yes," he 
adds, quickly stifling a yawn, "a nice government of Bossi, [PDS 
Deputy Secretary] D'Alema, [former Italian Popular Party (PPI)] 
Secretary Martinazzoli, [Rete leader] Orlando, and [Communist 
Renewal leader] Bertinotti? They come to an agreement. One 
could blow it over like a house of cards." 
  Maybe, but Silvio Berlusconi is not a laughing man, rather 
he 
is a man who smiles, with his now famous, voted for, telegenic 
smile ("let us not begin with the story of TV in the electoral 
campaign in which I had just 6 percent of presence on the TV 
screens in March, less than Bossi; so what else?"), a smile 
which perhaps was once the salesman's smile, but which has now 
become his own. It now seems obvious that the Vendor and the 
True Person have merged, as if Berlusconi has finally convinced 
himself that he is what he says he is. And Berlusconi is not 
someone to be ashamed of his success "which I have earned, 
worked hard for, like [Milan soccer star] Baresi who made his 
billions playing the great defender. And why not?" 
  If he does not smile, if he does not succeed in giving me 
the 
impression of a really happy man, at peace with himself, the 
reasons do not lie in money, Fininvest accounts, or the quarrels 
with Bossi. The secret lies in a championship which Berlusconi 
feels that he has not yet won, making the victories so far only 
partial victories: the superbowl of respect. When I ask him, a 
bit louder, in order to be heard above the buzz of the motor 
movers manicuring his lawns outside, if he, the most recent 
arrival at the table of power, still feels that he is treated as 
a "parvenu," I realize that I have struck to the heart of a man 
who has had enough of the teasing, of the commonplaces, of "Mr. 
TV," "Berlusca," "Arcore man," and "His Broadcasting Highness," 
which rain down on him. 
  It is as if a stopper had burst open. "It is a whole life 
which is involved. When I entered soccer, you know the results. 
I took a team on the edge of bankruptcy and carried them to 
three, touch wood, four championships and two champions' cups. 
When I wanted to make and sell houses which were different, 
properties which were different with gardens, footpaths, 
12-meter trees, and cycle tracks, people already began to laugh. 
I took in hand televisions belonging to private groups which 
were losing billions hand over fist, and everyone laughed 
because they believed that they had had the better of me, that 
they had hoodwinked the parvenu. I wanted to enter politics, 
and everyone said to me, including my dearest friends, even my 
family, but no, you are crazy, but you are going to your ruin, 
and ruin there would certainly have been, also for my industrial 
group, if I had lost. But I did not lose. Let them laugh." 
  Some 50 years striving for recognition, the liberation of 
this incubus: the parvenu. On a shelf, under a stupendous 18th 
century picture, I see a souvenir which reminds me of the first 
dollar which American billionaires used to frame, but it is not 
money. It is a little yellowed press clipping enclosed in 
Plexiglas, a two-column headline dating from 1961 announcing the 
award of the "Gioannino Manzoni" Advertising Award in an amount 
of 500,000 lire to Berlusconi Silvio. The first clipping of 
public respect. "I always had all of them against me, even in 
this election campaign. The newspapers were against me, 
Scalfari [LA REPUBBLICA editor], LA REPUBBLICA, and L'ESPRESSO, 
because they belong to another party. Mieli at the CORRIERE and 
Mauro at LA STAMPA because of their convictions and that of 
their editors. Montanelli has left IL GIORNALE without my ever 
saying anything to him, only a lunch-time phrase about Segni, 
who seemed to me destined to lose. He has gone his way because 
someone enamored of his own image as he was could not bear to 
cohabit with someone who was beating him precisely in the area 
of image. The same applies to Bossi. The big industrialists 
did not move a finger to help me. I ran alone." 
  We walked together down the gravel paths of the park, past 
the immense sculpture of Cascella, as far as the family tomb, 
excavated in the basement, to host friends, himself, but in 
particular his father, who died four years ago. "A certain 
journalist teased me about this tomb. But do you know why I 
built it? Because my father, before I died, said to me: 
`Silvio, put me in your park, and when you go running in the 
morning, stop for a moment and say to me: Goodbye, Dad.' Let us 
move on," and he pushed me outside, toward the green soccer 
fields where someone had placed the ball on the penalty kick-off 
disk, ready to be kicked surely into the goal net. "You are not 
cold?" he asked solicitously. "No, I have a question. With so 
much rage in your body, Doctor Berlusconi, do you have a wish 
for vendettas? Against the RAI [Italian State Broadcasting 
Corporation], against the newspapers, against everyone. 
  ``What are you saying? But I am incapable of vendettas, I am 
also incapable of taking it out against those who trip me up 
within my own companies, who betray me at home, no vendetta, 
never, against nobody. I would like to take the responsibility 
of governing in order to give my country a hand, not in order to 
punish anyone. This image of Berlusconi-Nero is ridiculous." 
  How many promises, how many easy hopes flew up into the blue 
sky of Brianza, and how easy it is to talk. "I have never 
spoken senselessly in my life, and my life itself demonstrates 
this. In the first 100 days of my government, if I am given 
responsibility for it, it will be necessary to give a hand to 
those who take risks, who invest, who create work. We need to 
work quickly to get the economy going again, very quickly. We 
need to reward, not to punish with taxation as the statist 
Socialists want to. And when we have public expenditure under 
control, we can also look at fairer taxation for those who can 
do less." One hundred days in the American fashion, in the 
Reagan fashion, in the Thatcher fashion, the models spew out. 
"Not models, but people I admire, and not that Ross Perot whom 
some have compared me with mistakenly. I am not a John Wayne in 
politics. I would certainly like to have Thatcher's success, 
but not have the country pay the social costs of these 
successes." 
  This then is the old "Italian dream," having one's cake and 
eating it. But it is not dreams, but income policies which have 
ruled our social peace until now. "You would like to ask me 
whether I will have done, as prime minister, with the income 
policy, with the agreements between CONFINDUSTRIA [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry], the government, and the 
trade unions. Martino, my main economic adviser, is a free 
trader of the Friedman school, he believes in the principle of 
competition, but he does not preach everyone fighting everyone 
else. Agreements are necessary. The problem is not to turn 
them into a straitjacket which imprisons development, the 
market, and employment itself, in particular of young people, 
which we wish to defend. I repeat, agreements with trade unions 
are necessary, providing they do not transform themselves into a 
barrier against the unemployed person seeking his first job." 
  Everything seems so easy, so logical, when one walks besides 
a persuasive man such as Berlusconi in his park, and the desire 
to "buy" is very strong. And for the same reason it is very 
easy not to believe, just as one does not believe in the 
promises of Carosello [TV advertising] promising to strengthen 
hair with lotion. On 28 March, Italy, ripped off by the First 
Republic, bought the Berlusconi lotion. Now we will see whether 
the hair grows better.
