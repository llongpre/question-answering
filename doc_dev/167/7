   ``I'm in a grumpy mood today,'' President Bush
groused Monday, complaining he had eaten too much Texas barbecue at
a Superbowl party.
   ``No answers today. I'm trying to think of answers and (I'm
getting) too many questions,'' he said as reporters asked him about
the $1.23 trillion budget plan he unveiled for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   Bush talked about his bad mood during a picture-taking ceremony
in the Oval Office with visiting British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd.
   Brushing off the press as he normally does at photo
opportunities, Bush said, ``I ate too much yesterday and I just
don't feel like answering any questions. And besides that, it
violates the groundrules to answer any questions.''
   He allowed as how he sometimes does answer, but ``only when we
want to answer questions.''
   Bush and his wife Barbara had about a dozen people in Sunday to
watch the Superbowl, and served barbecue from Ft. Worth.
   While saying he had overindulged, Bush quickly added, ``I don't
want to get any rumors started about my physical condition.
   ``I'm just grumpy. I don't want to talk about it.
   ``It was good,'' he concluded, talking about the food.
