   Television is teaching Britons to love the once
little-known sport of football, and American sporting goods
companies are cashing in on a craze for everything from uniforms to
T-shirts, badges and fluffy toys bearing NFL team logos.
   ``The market here is a six-year-old market,'' said Andrew
Maconie, whose company, Licensing Management International, handles
licensing, publishing and marketing for the National Football
League in Britain. ``It was created with television.''
   Britain's Channel 4 television began broadcasting weekly
highlights of NFL games in 1982, calling the program ``American
Football'' to distinguish it from soccer, called simply
``football'' here. Audiences have tripled to around 3 million
viewers each week, the TV station's studies say.
   Many British fans have gone beyond armchair-quarterbacking. More
than 100 teams have sprung up in the country, a league has been
formed sponsored by Budweiser beer, and several magazines dedicated
to the imported sport are being published.
   As the game has caught on, sales of American football
paraphernalia have taken off.
   Last year, Maconie sold more than $43 million worth of
NFL-licensed products, a 15 percent increase over the previous
year. He expects a similar climb this year.
   ``We started with zero in 1982, so we've obviously had some very
dramatic growth,'' said Maconie, who worked to put football on TV
here.
   The growth has attracted some of the top names in American
sporting goods to Britain. They have been helped by the U.S.
Embassy, which staged an ``American Football Equipment Exhibition''
to coincide with a pre-season NFL game Sunday at London's Wembley
Stadium between the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers, dubbed
``The American Bowl.''
   The British market for football items ``is here to stay, there's
no question about that,'' said Tom Knight, general manager of All
American Import Co., which distributes products made by St.
Louis-based Rawlings Sporting Goods.
   Standing at his booth decorated with samples of team shirts,
footballs and shoulderpads, Knight said sales of playing equipment
have leveled off as the sport has become more established.
   But, he said, sales of souvenir-type items, especially to
youngsters, ``is a side of the business which has been very big.''
   ``They, having seen their fathers and big brothers play, now
want to play themselves. That market can develop well,'' Knight
said.
   Chris Bye, an official with the Thames Valley Chargers, a team
in the Budweiser league, was hoping to find a good deal on helmets
at the trade fair.
   ``Each player takes 300 pounds (about $500) or more to kit each
year,'' he said. ``You have a squad of 50 players, that's a lot of
money.''
   Bye added that he was hoping to find higher quality goods for
his team.
   ``I believe that the existing stuff marketed to the general
public in England at the moment isn't of high enough quality,'' Bye
said. ``The stuff in the States is very good. We could sell some of
that over here.''
   Teddy Craze, whose Fast Lane Sports distributes for Champion
Products of Rochester, N.Y., says his sales of uniforms and various
NFL-licensed items have gone up by 300 percent in one year.
   ``There's really a good hard core'' of fans hungry for
American-made football goods, he said, ``and this is really
developing very strongly.''
   Another British firm, Woolgrove American Imports, recently began
distributing products made by Wilson Sporting Goods of River Grove,
Ill.
   Product manager Doug Proctor, his sales booth crammed with
Wilson footballs and other football paraphernalia, agreed that the
televised NFL highlights created a market that did not exist before.
   He said the NFL pre-season contests staged at Wembley the past
three summers also have sparked a lot of interest _ and sales.
   ``I think it's probably the best marketing system we have, in
fact, to have the top teams coming over here and showing how the
game is properly played,'' Proctor said. ``And it's a big spinoff
in the market.''
