Joe Carter, Rickey Henderson) are hitting a combined average of .270 this year 
with an average of 21 home runs and 75 RBI. 
</P>

same size as audiences for most regular-season NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: With his pleasant demeanor and attention to tennis history, Pete 
Sampras is almost too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Steve Trittschuh, a member of the U.S. soccer team that played in the 
World Cup last summer, recently became the first non-Czech since 1938 to score
