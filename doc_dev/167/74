ON Christmas Eve, 1989, a hopeless Dallas Cowboys team crept out of Texas
Stadium following the final home defeat of a season in which they won just
one out of 16 games. Despairing Texans sought solace in a joke about Tom
Landry, the legendary Cowboys head coach who had been unceremoniously sacked
the year before.
'Landry,' they said, 'wanted to get as far away from pro football as he
could this season - so he came to Texas Stadium.'
The club which had been known during coach Landry's great years in the 1970s
and early 1980s as 'America's Team', had become the butt of most of the bad
jokes in professional football.
Less than three years later, the Cowboys face the Philadelphia Eagles on
Monday night in a game that matches two genuine Super Bowl contenders, and
no one is cracking jokes about the team from Dallas anymore.
If the Cowboys go on to win the Super Bowl this year (and judging by their
performances so far, there are plenty of reasons to suspect they can), it
will be the shortest rags-to-riches story in the history of the National
Football League.
After their feeble single-win season in 1989, the Cowboys improved rapidly.
In 1990 they won seven out of 16. Last year they won 11 and reached the
play-offs, where they went out in the second round to Detroit.
They have already won their first three games of 1992, including impressive
victories over the two most recent Super Bowl champions, the Washington
Redskins and New York Giants. If they beat Philadelphia on Monday night, the
odds on a Cowboys championship will shorten considerably.
That Dallas has come so far, and so quickly, is a testament to the work of
two men: Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones, and head coach Jimmy Johnson.
When the Arkansas-born Jones bought the Cowboys in February 1989, he earned
the immediate enmity of Texans everywhere by sacking Landry who had led the
Cowboys for their first 29 years and taken them to five Super Bowls, and
ousting Tex Schramm, the club president and the only other Texan more
revered than Landry.
Although the first season was a disaster, it provided the new owner and
coach with the opportunity to dismantle the team and start over again. From
the summer of 1990 on, Jones and Johnson set about rebuilding the franchise
from scratch in an unprecedented burst of activity that involved big trades,
rapid contract signings and astute use of the draft system that brings
college players into the pros.
The most dramatic move was the first. In October 1989 the Cowboys' one true
star player, the running back Herschel Walker, was traded to the Minnesota
Vikings in exchange for five players and seven picks in future college
drafts.
Jones said recently: 'I didn't really have a timetable when I got here in
1989, but I had a commitment to use every avenue to upgrade the talent, even
if it meant sacrificing a win or two.'
At the time Jones and Johnson were vilified for the trade, but it has since
proved to be one of the most one-sided deals in the history of American
sports. Walker had a disastrous time in Minnesota, and he is now trying to
rebuild his shattered career at Philadelphia (which should add some extra
spice to Monday night's game).
Johnson has said: 'If we were concerned about respectability that first
year, we would have kept Walker . . . and tried to win two or three extra
games. But that wasn't going to get us to the Super Bowl.'
Among the players Dallas eventually got as part of that deal were running
back Emmitt Smith, defensive tackle Russell Maryland, one of the
heavyweights in the defensive line, and Kevin Smith who plays cornerback,
defending against the other team's wide receivers. The three players now
form part of the foundations for a championship team. While Maryland has the
potential to be a great player, The powerful, fast Emmitt Smith has already
achieved that status. Last year he was the best running back in the NFL,
with 1,563 yards to his credit. With wide receiver Michael Irvin, who gained
more yards catching passes than any other player in the league last year,
and the young quarterback Troy Aikman, the Cowboys have one of the most
potent air and ground attacks in football today.
After the Walker trade, the Cowboys picked up the pace. In 1990 they signed
a record 16 free agents (players without contracts). The following year all
17 of the team's draft choices were under contract by the time the 1991
season started, and a back-up quarterback, Steve Beuerlein, was acquired
from the Los Angeles Raiders.
Dallas have orchestrated an astonishing 42 trades in the last three years,
and why they try not to waste time signing a free agent or gambling on a
college draftee.
'Whatever we need, we make an effort to get, and we don't have to go through
a committee to get permission,' said Jones.
Last year, the Cowboys made four top draft picks, all of them defenders
brought in to shore up what was perceived to be the team's biggest weakness
 -an inability to defend effectively against opponents who pass much more
than they run.
The final piece in what could be the Cowboys' Super Bowl puzzle appeared
this summer, when Dallas picked up Charles Haley from San Francisco. Haley
is an intimidating defensive player expert at disrupting opposing
quarterback's pass plays. More importantly, he is a natural leader, an
essential commodity on the youngest team in the NFL (average age: 25). With
the players in place, coach Johnson has designed a playbook built to exploit
the team's two strengths: speed, and skill. In doing so, he is trying to
break the mould of power football that has traditionally dominated their NFC
East division.
After a solid start last year, the Cowboys reached the playoffs on the back
of a five-game winning streak built on three characteristics: an ability to
'make the big play'; an ability to score consistently when inside the
opponents' 20-year line; and an ability to avoid mistakes. Add these
qualities to the calibre of the top players, the youthful enthusiasm of the
squad, and Johnson's intelligent coaching, and Dallas has all the
ingredients for a Super Bowl year.
Conventional wisdom in the NFL has it that teams should pay their dues
before winning a Super Bowl (ie, spend at least half a decade rebuilding).
Yet the owner of the Cowboys believes they are ready for the title this
year.
As Jerry Jones has said over and over again this season: 'Why not us? Why
not now?' Why not indeed.
