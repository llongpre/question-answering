   A Federal Express Co. commercial that featured
an incredibly fast-talking businessman was the best advertisement
of the 1980s, according to a survey of the board of the ad trade
group The One Club.
   The Orwellian ``1984'' commercial for Apple Computer Inc. and a
series of Rolling Stone magazine print ads noting the differences
between some perceptions about its readers and reality also were
ranked among the best ads of the decade, the group said Wednesday.
   Ads for Levi Strauss' jeans, Nike shoes, the wine coolers
Bartles &amp; Jaymes and California Cooler and Miller Lite beer also
made the list.
   The One Club, an association of advertising copywriters and art
directors, developed its ranking based on responses to surveys in
which each of its 13 directors was asked to rank personal favorites
from the past decade.
   None of the directors' ad agencies placed an ad on the decade's
best list.
   Of the 12 best ads, 10 involved television commercials, one was
a print campaign and one used billboards.
   Mike Hughes, vice chairman and creative director of The Martin
Agency of Richmond, Va., said the directors generally were trying
to identify ads that broke from convention and spawned imitators of
their own.
   But he said 1985 commercials for Levi's 501 jeans, which showed
young people in urban settings cast in a blue-shaded hue, had a
style copied widely. ``A lot of commercials became blue,'' he said.
   Hughes said the top-rated ``Fast Talker'' ad from Federal
Express in 1982 brought activity to a halt in many households each
time the commercial aired.
   A separate Federal Express campaign from 1980 that showed top
executives anxious to get a package delivered picking up the phone
and saying ``Hello-o-o Federal'' broke the ad taboo of ``Never make
the customer look silly,'' Hughes said.
   Apple's ``1984'' ad showed a dreary scene of prisoners filing in
for a televised address by a dogmatic leader. The gloom was
shattered when a woman tossed a club that broke the screen. The ad
ran only once _ during the telecast of the 1984 Superbowl football
game _ but Hughes said no other ad has had more impact on one
airing.
   Authorship of a memorable ad in the 1980s did not necessarily
mean an ad agency kept the assignment. Ally &amp; Gargano, which made
the two winning Federal Express ads, is no longer the Federal
Express agency, and Apple has dropped Chiat-Day, which made
``1984,'' as its agency.
   But Chiat-Day offices, now known as Chiat-Day-Mojo, were
responsible for five of the 12 best ads, according to the One Club
survey.
   Here is the list of best ads of the decade, the year and the
agency responsible for them, according to The One Club:
   1. Federal Express, ``Fast-Talker,'' 1982, Ally &amp; Gargano, New
York.

   5. Bartles &amp; Jaymes, introductory TV campaign, 1986, Hal Riney &amp;
Partners, San Francisco.
   6. Levi Strauss, ``Gang, Blues Singer, Street Singer,'' 1985,
Foote Cone Belding, San Francisco.
   7. Federal Express, ``Hello-o-o Federal,'' 1980, Ally &amp; Gargano,
