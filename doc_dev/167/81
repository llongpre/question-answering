<LEADPARA>  This guy can beat you in so many ways. That kind of statement is usually made
about shortstops who bat .220 but have a lot of spirit.;    But when a pro
football fans see Lawrence Taylor, the New York Giants linebacker of some
renown, testing his passing arm, well, it may give you pause to wonder.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  SUPER BOWL XXV Notebook
Mercury News Staff Writer Ric Bucher contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Actually, L.T. was just fooling around, but a lot of folks in Jersey would
probably give you a good argument about his ability to step in wherever he is
needed.;  DON'T DARE BE LATE; Buffalo Coach Marv Levy was quizzed about the
various ways he may approach the Giants in Sunday's Super Bowl.;    Levy
referred to remarks he said were made before a bout between legendary
heavyweight champion Joe Louis and challenger Billy Conn:;    "When they asked
Billy, he talked about how he was going to bob and weave and everything else
he planned to do," Levy said. "Then they asked Joe Louis, who said, 'I'll be
there, and I'll be on time.' Well, that's what we're going to do. We'll be
there, and we'll be on time.";  THE THRILL OF IT ALL; New York Giants Coach
Bill Parcells, asked to recall the most memorable moment from his team's first
trip to the Super Bowl in 1987, said it was waiting to take the field. The
game, in which the Giants defeated Denver 39-20, was played in Pasadena's Rose
Bowl.;    "I think probably the thing most difficult to explain to anyone is
the thrill of standing in that tunnel waiting to go out . . . and feeling that
exhilaration that comes over you, the feeling that, for one day, you're on
center stage.";  THAT'S A WRAP; Let the quarterback controversy begin.;   
Asked whether injured Phil Simms or super backup Jeff Hostetler would be his
starting quarterback next season, Parcells said, "We'll see in training camp.
I go by what I see. I'll play the best guys." . . .;    Parcells had his
running backs practice wearing uniform numbers in the 90s Thursday to foil any
potential spies. Asked what he would have them wear Friday, Parcells said,
smiling, "They're wearing all blanks today. Think that's a sign of paranoia?"
. . .;    The Bills had their first curfew of any kind Thursday, which Levy
said was a 12:30 a.m. "honor" curfew. He said he had no idea if anyone missed
it. The Bills' curfew for Friday and tonight is 11 p.m.;  AMERICA'S FAVORITE
CELEBS; CAN'T DECIDE WHO WILL WIN; No real scholarly look at the Super Bowl
would be complete without a poll of celebrities. So, here goes:;    Morganna
Roberts, the entertainer who made a career out of running out onto playing
fields and kissing athletes:;    "Sure, I know who's in the Super Bowl -- the
Bills and Giants. I'm praying for the Giants because Lawrence Taylor and I did
a card show together and he's a very nice man. But I've known Jim Kelly for
years. He used to come see me when I danced in a club in Houston and he was
with the Houston Gamblers (of the USFL). He's such a nice person. So I guess
I'll have to root for the Bills.";    Cal Ripken, Baltimore Orioles
shortstop:;    "Buffalo, 17-10. The Bills are playing so well, they remind you
of the 49ers. . . . But if there's one thing that could stop Buffalo, it would
be a good defense like the Giants.";    Andie MacDowell, actress-model:;   
"I'm proud of both the teams from my adopted home state, but it will
definitely be the Buffalo Bills by at least 10 points. Their offense is too
much and they have a really sound defense anchored by No. 78. I can't remember
his name, but he's great.";    Johnny Bench, former Cincinnati catcher:;    "I
like Buffalo because the Bills can score. The offense of the Giants has
revolved around their defense. Buffalo scored 95 points in two weeks and you
might think that 21 points will win the Super Bowl. I think Buffalo has shown
it can score 21 points easier than the Giants.";    Dr. Ruth Westheimer, sex
therapist: "The Giants will win because of the momentum they got in their big
win against San Francisco.";    Charles Grodin, actor:;    "I believe the
Giants will win the Super Bowl, because those of us who live in New York City
don't need anymore bad news.";    Jim Leyland, Pittsburgh Pirates manager:;   
"Buffalo, 16-13. I'm a little nervous about that pick because the Giants have
been there before. But Thurman Thomas will be the difference because he can
run and catch so well he will keep Lawrence Taylor and the Giants defense off
balance.";    Eddie Murray, Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman:;    "I don't
want to make Lawrence Taylor mad, but Buffalo's offense and defense is really
on a roll. Without a two-week layoff, they will continue to roll. The Giant
defense is tough, but I'd rather have my No. 1 quarterback (Jim Kelly) than a
backup (Jeff Hostetler) in the big game.";    Dick Vitale, sportscaster:;   
"Buffalo 24-17. Jim Kelly -- too tough. Bruce Smith -- best defensive player
in football. Move over Lawrence Taylor, baa-bee. It's not your day today.";   
Scott Hamilton, ice skater:;    "I would say Buffalo. They've been the
wretched refugees in the NFL for too long, and an AFC team hasn't won a Super
Bowl in a while. It's time.";    Larry King, talk show host:;    "Buffalo
23-10 in a very good game. I pick Buffalo because they finished the season as
the absolute best team in football. They're a team that comes along once in a
blue moon. Besides, I picked them to win the Super Bowl before the season
began.";    Beano Cook, TV analyst:;    "New York Giants 42, Buffalo Bills 10.
If the 49ers show up, San Francisco 49, Buffalo 10. The AFC is still the Ivy
League of pro football.";    Jerry Mathers, TV child star:;    "I got wiped
out. I'm a Raiders person. I'm totally cleaned out. If I had to go with one,
it would be the Giants.";    Toni Tennille, singer:;    "When the Niners were
out of it, I kind of lost interest. Probably the Bills.";     Dr. Joyce
Brothers, psychologist:;    "The Giants are going to win without question;
reason being that they have an excellent defense. Additionally, the Giants
play a slowdown game and keep running the clock, and there is nothing that
drives people bananas as much as that. Understand, Americans tend to be
action-oriented, and a great psychological defense is slowing down the game.
Also, Buffalo is not good on the road, and they're going to be disoriented,
though not as disoriented as they'll be by the slow tempo."OK, that's it. Stop
the music, stop the music.  </TEXT>
