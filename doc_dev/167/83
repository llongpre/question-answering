   George Allen, who transformed
two professional football teams from losers to winners, then came
out of a five-year retirement to take over a struggling,
small-college team, died Monday. He was 72.
   Allen, who coached the Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskins
of the NFL, also served as chairman of the President's Council on
Physical Fitness from 1981, going on television to exhort Americans
to shape up.
   He died at his home here of natural causes, said his son, Greg.
He is survived by his wife Etty, a daughter and three sons.
   Allen was alone at home when his wife returned in the early
afternoon and found him dead in the kitchen, said Mike Tracy of the
Palos Verdes Estates Police Department. She had last seen him alive
at 10:30 a.m.
   Allen, who also coached two teams with the short-lived USFL in
the early 1980s, had ended a five-year retirement to coach at Long
Beach State in December 1989. He said at the time he missed the
challenge.
   Allen ranks as the winningest coach in team history for both the
Rams and the Redskins and had the third-best winning percentage of
.712 among NFL coaches with 100 or more victories. He was 49-17-4,
or .742, with Los Angeles from 1966 to 1970, and 67-30-1, or .691,
with Washington from 1971 to 1977.
   Although he had excellent records in the pros, he never was able
to produce a National Football League champion. The closest he came
was with the Redskins in the 1972 season, when they lost 14-7 to
the Miami Dolphins in the seventh Super Bowl.
   Allen said his 6-5 winning season at Long Beach State this year
was the most rewarding of his entire career. The team scored 4-8
the previous season.
   In an interview last Thursday, Allen said his health had
suffered since his players drenched him with icewater to celebrate
a season-ending victory over Nevada-Las Vegas. ``We couldn't afford
Gatorade,'' he said, smiling.
   However, Allen had been showing up recently at the practices of
the Iowa Hawkeyes, who were holding drills at Long Beach State in
preparation for Tuesday's Rose Bowl game against Washington. He was
at practice Sunday, and appeared fit and animated.
   Allen's celebrated coaching career, which covered four decades,
began in 1948 at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa. In his
first year, the team had a 3-6 record.
   It was one of only three times he had a losing record, the other
two coming at Whittier College in 1951 and 1954.
   He took over the struggling Los Angeles Rams in 1966 and led the
team to a 8-6 record, their first winning season in eight years.
The next year, the Rams finished first in the division with an
11-1-2 record, Allen's best single-season mark.
   Allen was known for wild spending to build a winner and trading
draft choices for such veterans as defensive linemen Diron Talbert,
Ron McDole and Richie Petitbon, earning the Redskins the nickname
``The Over the Hill Gang.''
   The nine games he won in his first season were the most
Washington had managed in 29 years.
   ``His basic philosophy was us against them,'' said Petitbon, who
played for Allen with the Chicago Bears, Rams and Redskins and
became his assistant in Washington. ``He made enemies of everyone -
the media, other teams - and it was effective. He was a great
motivator. The players loved him.''
   Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke said Allen ``was a Trojan for
work and for winning. He was one of the indestructibles.
   Though the Redskins kept winning, Allen was fired after the 1977
season. The late Edward Bennett Williams, who owned the team at
that time, said ``George was given an unlimited budget - and
exceeded it.''
   Allen landed back in Los Angeles, but the Rams fired him just
two games into the 1978 exhibition schedule.
   Allen also had two winning seasons in the now-defunct United
States Football League. He coached the Arizona Wranglers in 1984,
where he was 10-8, and the Chicago Blitz in 1983, leading them to a
12-6 mark.
   ``I talked to Coach Allen a few weeks ago and he was just so
excited about the winning season he had at Long Beach State,'' said
Houston Oilers coach Jack Pardee, who played under Allen as a
linebacker with the Washington Redskins.
   ``Coach Allen always thrived on building something out of very
little,'' Pardee said. ``And he was very excited about the
continuing challenge that he had at Long Beach.''
   ``George really did turn things around for the Rams and got us
on a winning track,'' said Hall of Fame defensive lineman Merlin
Olsen, who played under Allen. ``He always carried such great
enthusiasm with him and was one of the consummate motivators.''
   An advocate of physical fitness who competed in marathons,
bike-a-thons and triathlons, Allen founded the National Fitness
Foundation in 1952. A member of the President's Council on Physical
Fitness for several years, he was named chairman by President
Reagan in 1981.
   Allen wrote 11 books on football, one of which was the first
encyclopedia of football drills.
   Allen's friends in Washington included President Nixon. He once
used a play Nixon diagrammed for a playoff game against the San
Francisco 49ers. The reverse to wide receiver Roy Jefferson went
for a loss.
