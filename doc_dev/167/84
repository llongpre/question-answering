<LEADPARA>  FOOTBALL fans longing for the good old days can wrap themselves up in a new
line of nostalgic sweat shirts, caps and jackets to match their memories this
fall.;   "Throwbacks" is the catchy name of a new line of vintage-inspired
clothing licensed by the National Football League. Original logos, team colors
and names that have changed over time as well as old photographs provide the
graphics for most of the items, priced from $18 for caps, $22 for T-shirts,
$40 for sweat shirts and $250 for a jacket.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The graphics "harken back to a different feeling about the game -- a
reflection of players who were down and dirty, leather helmets and
play-it-in-the-streets-if-you-had-to. It's indicative of the way the league
started in the '20s and '30s," says Jeff Sofka, senior licensing manager for
NFL Properties.;   "The good old days always seem better than what we have
today," Sofka adds. "The nostalgia craze in America obviously has been growing
and we have had some nostalgic products in our assortment over the years, but
never a complete collection. We felt it was time to take a stand in the
nostalgia business and create a themed marketing program.";   Unfortunately
for 49er Faithful, East Coast teams dominate the initial offerings. For San
Francisco's single T-shirt or sweat shirt with a "weathered" finish there are
three for the Canton Bulldogs and two each for the Chicago Bears, Green Bay
Packers, New York Giants and Washington Redskins.;   "The NFL teams with the
most interesting histories will make for the best Throwbacks market," Sofka
says. "Chicago, Green Bay and New York are the three that come to mind first
because of the tremendous histories of the Bears, Packers and Giants. But as
we research into team histories we're finding some great stories about the San
Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams that used to be the Cleveland Rams.";
  The Throwbacks collection covers three periods of NFL history -- "The
Originals," 1920-1949; "The Expansion Years," 1950-1969 and "The Modern Era,"
1970-1990. First shown to retailers in July, shipments are expected to start
in September.;   Dave Alioto, owner of seven Sports Stuff stores in the Bay
Area and one in Reno, says he will be carrying the line and expects the caps
to be the most popular item, as they have been with a similar nostalgia-themed
collection of baseball apparel.;   THE UNIFORMS OF THE OLYMPIAD: With the
Games of the XXVth Olympiad less than I year away, manufacturers and retailers
are starting to carry their own torches for Olympic-themed products.;  
Designer Henry Grethel scored the biggest coup by being named designer for the
parade uniforms for both the Winter Games in Albertville, France, and the
Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. The task means coming up with outfits for
more than 1,100 athletes, coaches and officials in women's sizes 4 to 18 and
men's sizes 36 short to 58 extra-long jackets, 14 1/2- to 20-inch shirts and
26- to 52-inch waist pants. Best news of all is that Grethel plans to go
beyond the tired, warm-up suit look so many countries use.;   Sunglasses
manufacturer Bausch &amp; Lomb signed on to be one of 12 worldwide sponsors of the
1992 games and in conjunction with that commitment is launching the Ray-Ban
Olympic series. All styles in the collection feature the Olympic rings motif.;
  Besides marketing Olympic sunglasses, Bausch &amp; Lomb is also planning to give
each Olympic medal winner a special limited-edition pair of bronze, silver or
gold Ray-Bans. Go for the glasses.;   J.C. Penney continues as the exclusive
retailer of the USA Olympic brand of clothing and shoes. The chain has
contributed $12.5 million to the United States Olympic Committee from its
sales of $98 million on products carrying the USA Olympic symbol over the past
two years.  </TEXT>
