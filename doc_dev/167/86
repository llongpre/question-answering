<LEADPARA>  THOSE WATCHDOG folks at the NFL Players Association still haven't fully
documented the contract figures for the latest 49ers No. 1 draft pick, Ted
Washington. But we can forgive them for not keeping customary track of their
newest clients' salaries this season.;    Seems the NFLPA is busy scoring
victory after victory against the enemy -- the owners -- in various courtrooms
throughout the land. It all has Executive Director Gene Upshaw and the rest of
his staff pretty tied up, and the owners fit to be tied.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The players won two huge decisions in the past three weeks. First, U.S.
District Judge David Doty in Minneapolis cleared a path for players to sue for
free agency by throwing out the NFL's labor exemption.;    Then on July 5,
another district court, this time in Washington, D.C., ruled the NFL's
antitrust exemption ended with the expiration of the last collective
bargaining agreement in 1987. The judge, Royce C. Lamberth, found for players
who sued over pay for members of the controversial developmental squads in
1989, and the ruling could result in even bigger changes.;    How about a wage
scale, which management is pushing for? No way. The courts are saying this
can't be forced upon players. The NFL is now liable under federal antitrust
laws. Remember, no more exemption.;    The latest ruling also could mean the
end of the college draft, which the union argues is a violation of antitrust
laws and limits players' salaries. The draft itself is due to expire next
spring under the old 1982 collective bargaining agreement.;    But this is
what has management most nervous: Since antitrust plaintiffs are awarded
triple damages, the league, the NFLPA estimates, could be liable for $75
million to $80 million. Ouch.;    How are the owners responding? By fighting
back. Thursday, they voted in Dallas to begin taking depositions from top
agents in their suit against the NFLPA regarding price-fixing.;    The battle
royal continues. Stay tuned . . .;  NO DOUGH, NO SHOW: Denver Broncos running
back Bobby Humphrey and free safety Steve Atwater, both three-year veterans
and Pro Bowl players with two years left on their contracts, are no-shows at
camp. They're looking for more cash. Coach Dan Reeves has no sympathy for the
two, who made a combined $1.365 million last year.;    "This football team has
always shown that it is going to compensate its people fairly. I'm very
disappointed they aren't here," Reeves said, fuming. "If you sign something,
you've got to be happy with it. I've never seen a player or a coach come in
and say, 'I had a bad year last year, I want to rip it up and I'll give you
some money back.';    While Humphrey and Atwater fared well individually, the
Broncos themselves were, well, the best doggone 5-11 team in the league last
season.;    Said quarterback John Elway, "I've got three years left on my
contract. When you've had a bad year, they don't dock your pay, they don't
kick you out of camp. So if you have a good year, I don't think you
automatically go in and ask for a new contract. I think you stand by the
contract that you sign.";  GROUNDED: His $26 million contract hangs like an
albatross around Raghib "Rocket" Ismail's neck. Sure, it's tough to fly with a
pulled quadriceps, but when Rocket missed his season opener as a Toronto Argo,
the razzing took off like he apparently can't.;    "Everybody's waiting to see
what he can do," veteran Ottawa guard Bryan Illerbrun said. "I only wish I was
on the punt team, so I'd be there if he dropped his wallet.";  SEE YA: Gone,
and hopefully soon forgotten, is Zeke Mowatt, best known for being one of the
three New England Patriots implicated last season in the sexual harassment of
reporter Lisa Olson.;    "It didn't seem he was happy with the football team,
and we wanted him to have an opportunity elsewhere," said Patriots Coach Dick
MacPherson, who waived Mowatt.;    But Mowatt may yet surface with the New
York Giants, who need a replacement for the injured Mark Bavaro.;  EXTRA
POINTS: Former Iowa running back Nick Bell is signed and working out with the
Los Angeles Raiders, leaving Southern Cal quarterback Todd Marinovich, the
first-round pick, as the Raiders' only unsigned pick. . . . Agent Bob Woolf
was so concerned about getting his first-round clients, No. 4 Mike Croel and
No. 5 Todd Lyght into their respective camps on time, he went on vacation last
week in Europe. . . . Buffalo Bills safety Mark Kelso, 27, has been working
with a track coach in the off-season to improve his speed. He says his
200-meter time has dropped from 29 seconds to 26 seconds. . . . New Orleans
Saints defensive lineman Frank Warren has been reinstated by NFL Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue after a yearlong drug suspension. . . . Broncos running back
Steve Sewell agreed to a three-year contract, leaving Denver with five
unsigned veterans.  </TEXT>
