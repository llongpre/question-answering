   Coca-Cola Co. has been stuck with 20 million
pairs of 3-D glasses ever since the last episode of ``Moonlighting''
was nixed last spring by the writers' strike. It says it just found
a super way to use them.
   The soft drink giant, the National Football League and NBC
announced Monday they would cooperate in a three-dimensional
broadcast of the 12-minute Super Bowl XXIII halftime show and a
45-second Diet Coke ad next month.
   The Atlanta-based company said its bottlers would distribute the
special glasses, which will enable fans to see the 3-D approach,
with purchases of Diet Coke in the two weeks before the Jan. 22
contest for the NFL championship.
   Coca-Cola ordered the glasses earlier this year after agreeing
with the ``Moonlighting'' producers that a commercial and a portion
of the final show of the 1987-88 season would be shot with the new
3-D technology.
   But the episode was canceled after the writers went on strike and
the Coca-Cola commercial never was made. Production of the glasses
was halted at 20 million and they were stored while Coca-Cola looked
for other TV showcases.
   Network executives said the halftime program would be the first
live 3-D broadcast on network television, and would continue NBC's
tradition of innovation in football coverage. NBC broadcast a
``silent minute'' to give viewers a break from the Super Bowl
pre-game show in 1986 and aired an entire regular season game with
no announcers a few years ago.
   Viewers will need the glasses to get the 3-D effect, but a new
technology called Nuoptix 3-D, developed by Terry Beard, founder and
head of the Los-Angeles-based Nuoptix Associates Inc., leaves the
picture normal for others.
   The patented process avoids the distortion or double-imaging of
the picture that the 3-D processes of the 1950s caused for those
without special glasses.
   Not content to let a volley sound in the cola wars without
responding, Pepsi-Cola Co. announced separately Monday that its Diet
Pepsi brand has agreed to be the official sponsor of NBC's NFL
player talent show to be broadcast before the big game. The talent
show will match NFL players in competition as singers, dancers and
comedians.
   Calling the announcement ``a surprise move,'' Pepsi's executive
vice president of marketing and sales, Michael Lorelli, said ``Diet
Pepsi's end-run on Diet Coke just signaled the start of an intense
off-the-field battle.''
   Asked about Pepsi's announcement at the news conference where he
announced the deal with Coca-Cola, NBC Sports executive producer
Michael Weisman said the network had not settled sponsorship of the
pre-game talent show.
   But a Pepsi spokesman, Tod MacKenize, insisted that Pepsi-Cola
had returned a signed contract to NBC last week and that the deal
was done.
   Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, and Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers,
N.Y., dominate the $43.2 billion U.S. soft drink business.
   Diet Coke is the best-selling diet soft drink and the third
biggest seller overall with about 8.2 percent of the overall soft
drink market. Diet Pepsi ranks second in the category and fourth
overall at 5.2 percent.
   The two soft drink giants are always on the lookout for splashy
new ways to boost anticipation of their commercials and get big
audiences for them.
   Michael Beindorff, vice president for advertising at Coca-Cola,
said he had been aproached with dozens of opportunities to showcase
a 3-D commercial, but rejected them until the Super Bowl opportunity
came along.
   ``This is not just a few minutes or a couple of special
effects,'' Beindorff said. ``It's not just pre-game fluff or a
post-game throwaway.''
