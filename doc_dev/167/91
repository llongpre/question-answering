<LEADPARA>  When the Giants have the ball; The game plan probably will be what it has been
all season -- run, run, run, particularly since New York rushed for 157 yards
in the first meeting between the teams. The burden probably will fall on Ottis
Anderson (24) now that Rodney Hampton is out because of a broken left leg.
Hampton had 105 yards in 21 carries against the Bills.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Anderson, who at 33 is the league's oldest running back, will receive help
from Dave Meggett (30), the team's leading receiver. He carried 10 times for
36 yards against the 49ers in the NFC title game Sunday. Lewis Tillman (34)
also might see action.;    The Giants principal target in running situations
probably will be Jeff Wright (91), the nose tackle who is being constantly
tested. One key matchup will be New York's best run-blocker, left tackle John
"Jumbo" Elliott (76) against Buffalo's Bruce Smith (78), the NFL's defensive
player of the year. New York also might use a triple tight-end formation with
Howard Cross (87) and Bob Mrosko (80) joining Mark Bavaro (89).;    Since Jeff
Hostetler (15) has taken over at quarterback for the injured Phil Simms, the
Giants have used more play-action passes and rollouts. Against the 49ers,
Hostetler hit Bavaro and Mark Ingram (82) for five completions each. Stephen
Baker (85) is the deep threat against a secondary whose best coverage man is
right cornerback Nate Odomes (37). Strong safety Leonard Smith (46) is a
ferocious run-stopper, but can be beaten by play-action passes.;    The
strength of the Bills' defense is its linebackers -- particularly Darryl
Talley (56), Cornelius Bennett (97) and Shane Conlan (58). Bennett and Conlan
are Pro Bowl picks and Talley, who had two interceptions against the Raiders
in the AFC title game, should be.;    Talley, Bennett, Smith and left end Leon
Seals (96) are the main pass-rushing threats.;    The Bills also must watch
out for gimmick plays, such as the 30-yard fake punt that set up an important
field goal against the 49ers.;  WHEN THE BILLS HAVE THE BALL; The Buffalo
offense has been spectacular since it began using the no-huddle offense, which
gives Jim Kelly (12), the freedom to call plays at the line of scrimmage.
Buffalo led the league in scoring (426 points) and has scored 95 points in two
playoff victories.;    The offense is the NFL's most balanced, with Thurman
Thomas (34), the AFC's leading rusher with 1,297 yards and the second-leading
receiver with 49 catches. But the main receiving threats are Andre Reed (83)
and the rejuvenated James Lofton (80), who at 34 has had 100-yard games in
both playoff contests. Tight end Keith McKeller (84) is a dangerous secondary
target. Running back Kenneth Davis (23) is the short-yardage threat.;    The
offensive line is one of the league's best, anchored by All-Pro center Kent
Hull (67). Tackle Will Wolford (69) and guard Jim Ritcher (51) are close to
that level.;    That high-scoring offense will be matched against a team that
surrendered the fewest points (211) of any team in the league and has allowed
one touchdown in two playoff games. Like the Bills, the strength is at
linebacker led by Lawrence Taylor (56), whom Coach Bill Parcells calls "the
best player of the last 10 years.";    But inside linebacker Pepper Johnson
(52) had an All-Pro season; outside linebacker Carl Banks (58) was hampered by
injuries but is of All-Pro caliber; and Steve DeOssie (99) and Gary Reasons
(55), who share the other inside spot, are steady. DeOssie is strong in
rushing situations, Reasons against the pass.;    The steadiest defensive
lineman is nose tackle Erik Howard (74), a former Bellarmine Prep player whose
battle against Hull might be one of the keys to the game. Leonard Marshall
(70) had his best game in three seasons against the 49ers. Defensive end John
Washington (73) is a strong run-stuffer.;    The most improved part of the
defense is the secondary, where veteran Everson Walls (28) has added stability
to an otherwise young unit. Left cornerback Mark Collins (25) shut down the
Niners' Jerry Rice twice this season and is the best cover man. Second-year
safeties Myron Guyton (29) and Greg Jackson (47) are future stars. Nickel back
Perry Williams (23) was a six-year starter who was beaten out by Walls.; 
Special teams; The Giants and Bills each feature a Pro Bowl special-teams
player, Reyna Thompson (21) of New York and Steve Tasker (89) of Buffalo.;   
The Giants have a distinct edge in punting with Sean Landeta (5), one of the
league's best, vs. journeyman Rick Tuten (10) of the Bills.;    Scott Norwood
(11), the Bills' place-kicker is the only Buffalo player to have been in a
title game -- in the USFL. He and Matt Bahr (9) of the Giants, are accurate
from about 45 yards or closer. Bahr, who hit 5 of 6 attempts to beat the
49ers, missed once from inside 40 yards this season.;    If there is a
weakness in New York's special teams, it's kickoff coverage -- Bahr rarely
reaches the goal line and opponents often return the ball beyond the 30.
Buffalo has led the league in kickoff coverage the past four seasons.;    But
New York has the most dangerous returner in Meggett, who is better brining
back punts than kickoffs.;  Coaching; Buffalo's Marv Levy won two
championships in the Canadian Football League but this is his first Super
Bowl. He was known as a conservative coach and criticized Cincinnati's Sam
Wyche for using a no-huddle offense in the AFC title game two seasons ago. But
that helped convince him to implement a no-huddle himself last season and to
put it in full time this season when he became convinced Kelly could improvise
well enough to run it.;    Both coordinators, Walt Corey on defense and Ted
Marchibroda on offense, are considered among the best at their job in the
NFL.;    The Giants' Parcells is perhaps the ranking defensive genius in the
NFL. Give him two weeks and he can devise a defense to stop any offense, as he
did when he and defensive coordinator Bill Belichick put in an
uncharacteristic 4-3 defense to shut down Chicago's running game. Belichick is
one of the leading candidates for the Cleveland coaching job.;    The
offensive coaching is far more conservative. Parcells and offensive
coordinator Ron Erhardtprefer to run as much as possible. When behind, they
often will throw on every down.  </TEXT>
