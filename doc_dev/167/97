<LEADPARA>  IT ONLY seems appropriate that for the 25th anniversary Super Bowl, the NFL
get the best game ever in the series. To do that, however, requires some
patching together of bits and pieces from the series. Here, then, are the
bests, a quarter century of Super Bowl superlatives:;    (box) BEST
PREDICTION: He was Broadway Joe, a swaggering, swashbuckling quarterback with
a knock-that-chip-off-my-shoulder posture. And cocky Joe Namath had taken the
upstart AFL New York Jets to the 1969 Super Bowl, where they were 19-point
underdogs to the establishment NFL Baltimore Colts.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Namath had other ideas.;    He produced the best prediction in Super
Bowl history.;    "It was at the Miami Touchdown Club on Wednesday before the
game," he said. "I got up to speak, and, before I had a chance to open my
mouth, some guy said, 'Say something about the Colts.';    "I said, 'Hey,
they've been talking all week. Now it's my turn. I've got news for you. We're
gonna win.' ";    And then he delivered the kicker.;    "I guarantee it!";   
Final score: New York 16, Baltimore 7, with Namath completing 17 of 28 passes
for 206 yards.;    (box) BEST OPENING PLAY: Dallas Coach Tom Landry ran a
buttoned-down operation, but every so often he'd loosen his collar.;    For
the 1976 Super Bowl against Pittsburgh, he produced the best opening play
ever, a razzle-dazzle reverse on the opening kickoff.;    By a linebacker.;   
"That was Ditka's thinking," Landry said.;    Special-teams coach Mike Ditka
approached Landry with the idea. Have Preston Pearson take the kickoff and
then hand the ball off to Hollywood Henderson.;    The play worked
spectacularly. Pearson took Roy Gerela's kickoff at the 3, ran about 5 yards
and then handed off to Henderson. Forty-eight yards later, the Cowboys were in
business at the Steelers' 44.;    (box) BEST SECOND QUARTER: To fully
understand what the Washington Redskins did to the Denver Broncos in the
second quarter of the 1988 Super Bowl, just read the play-by-play.;    (check)
Doug Williams, 80 pass to Ricky Sanders, deep right. Touchdown, 14:07.;   
(check) Williams, 27 pass to Gary Clark, deep left sideline. Touchdown,
10:15.;    (check) Tim Smith, 58 run around right end. Touchdown, 8:33.;   
(check) Williams, 50 pass to Sanders, deep right. Touchdown, 3:42.;    (check)
Williams, 8 pass to Clint Didier, left end zone. Touchdown, 1:04.;    Five
touchdowns in 13:03, the greatest offensive explosion in Super Bowl history.; 
  Washington had 35 points in the period as Williams hit 9 of 11 passes, four
for TDs. The Redskins won 42-10.;    (box) BEST CELEBRATION: All season long,
linebacker Harry Carson had been celebrating New York Giants victories by
dumping various liquids on Coach Bill Parcells.;    It became a ritual in the
final two minutes of games, Carson casually standing on the sideline, waiting
for his opportunity, looking so innocent. Then he would sneak up on Parcells
and spill water, Gatorade, whatever was handy, on the coach.;    It was a
statement that on New York's 1987 Super Bowl team, Parcells was just one of
the boys. He called himself "a Jersey guy," a blue-collar coach who had
survived a first season of 3-12-1 to bring the Giants to the Super Bowl four
years later.;    In the waning minutes of the Giants' 39-20 victory over
Denver, anybody who had followed the team's season knew that Carson would be
on the prowl. So did Parcells, of course. The coach wasn't going to spoil the
fun now, though.;    Carson, taking no chances, stripped off his jersey and
shoulder pads and borrowed one of the yellow slickers that NFL security people
wear at the Super Bowl. The disguise was perfect, provided you ignored his
football pants, pads and cleats.;    Now he tiptoed behind Parcells, who,
armed with a 19-point lead, must have been too busy scripting the Giants' next
offensive series to notice. Carson wasted no time. He seized the opportunity,
grabbing the Gatorade canister and drenching the coach one more time.  </TEXT>
