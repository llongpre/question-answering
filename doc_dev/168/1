   The United States has no plans to send
military forces to Trinidad, where Prime Minister Arthur Robinson
and more than 30 others are being held hostage by Moslem rebels,
the State Department said today.
   At the same time, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher criticized
Libya's involvement with the rebels, saying it has provided some
training for the insurgents. But he said there was no apparent
direct link between Libya and the hostage-taking, which occurred
last Friday.
   Boucher refused comment on reports that U.S. military assets
were being deployed in the vicinity of Trinidad but said ``there
are no plans for U.S. military intervention.''
   The USS Roosevelt paid a scheduled visit to Port-of-Spain July
20-23, the Navy said. The carrier is now in port in Norfolk. The
Navy has 10 ships in the Caribbean on what the Navy calls ``routine
exercises.''
   Boucher said there have been no reports of injury to the
estimated 6,000 Americans living in Trinidad.
   President Bush was keeping up to date on developments after
returning to Washington late Sunday after a weekend at his vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   ``We fully support the government of Prime Minister (Arthur)
Robinson and hope for a peaceful solution to the situation there,''
said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   U.S. officials said any direct U.S. role had been all but ruled
out. Even sending U.S. experts on hostage negotiations _ discussed
informally on Saturday between the United States and
representatives of the Trinidad government _ had been ruled out,
sources said.
   ``The Trinidadians would like to find a solution on their own
without any outside assistance. They'd just rather settle it
themselves,'' the official said.
   The administration has hailed Trinidad's government as a model
of democracy, and the attempted coup was viewed with distress in
Washington.
   Abu Bakr, the leader of a Moslem sect, launched the coup attempt
late Friday by seizing the Parliament building in Port-of-Spain and
capturing Robinson and about 40 other hostages.
   Angus Khan, the ambassador from Trinidad and Tobago to the
United States, said the negotiations between his government and the
``terrorists over the release of the hostages are very delicate.''
He refused to say more.
