   HISTORY _ Columbus discovered Trinidad on his third voyage to
the New World in 1498. Spain made the first successful attempt to
colonize the island in 1592 and Spanish rule continued until
Trinidad was captured by the British in 1797. Abolition of slavery
throughout the British Empire in 1833 led to a wave of immigration
from India that went on until 1915. Trinidad and Tobago were merged
in 1888. After a brief spell of being part of an autonomous
Federation of the West Indies with Jamaica, Barbados, and the
Leeward and Windward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago became
independent and joined the Commonwealth in 1962.
   The nation has a bicameral legislature of Senate and House of
Representatives. The Cabinet consists of the prime minister,
appointed by the president, and other ministers.
