   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson said he was gagged, beaten and shot in the leg by Moslem
fundamentalists who held him and other Cabinet ministers hostage in
an attempt to overthrow the government.
   ``I was incensed at the manner in which we were treated,''
Robinson said in a television interview broadcast Friday night. It
was his first public appearance since he was freed Tuesday.
   ``We were roughed up, made to lie face down on the floor, our
pants down, legs tied ... unable to turn except with excrutiating
pain,'' he said.
   Robinson, whose right cheek was badly bruised, spoke from his
hospital bed to Trinidad television.
   Robinson spoke briefly of his five-day captivity inside the
Parliament chamber and of the Moslem insurgents who held Cabinet
members inside the building until they surrendered on Wednesday.
   ``I really do not wish to re-live those events at this
particular moment,'' he said. ``But it is a fact I was gagged; that
the gag was being pushed down my throat by a gun.''
   Robinson said the gag thrust down his throat caused him to
vomit. He said he was shot in the right leg after shouting
``Murderers! Torturers!'' and calling on his two-way radio to the
armed forces to storm the building.
   Robinson said his leg ``is still in such a state that I cannot
use it.''
   The prime minister, who is losing his eyesight because of
glaucoma, was released by the rebels Tuesday for health reasons.
   ``Now, I could have been out before on medical grounds, but I
was convinced that my duty was to stay with my colleagues until the
fate of all of us was certain,'' he said.
   Robinson did not say whether he signed an agreement with the
rebels, who had insisted on his resignation and early elections as
conditions for the release of the hostages.
   Besides Robinson and his Cabinet, the rebels also held 26 other
hostages inside the Trinidad and Tobago Television station.
   Officials said an estimated 38 people were killed during the
coup attempt. Maj. Dave Williams said the government is still
trying to determine the count.
   Abu Bakr, the leader of the Moslem radicals, and more than 100
of his followers were being held at the Chaguaramas military
headquarters. Lawyers were meeting Saturday to draw up charges
against them that could include murder, treason and kidnapping.
   On Saturday, one of Bakr's followers was killed in a shootout
with police.
   Police Inspector Winston Cooper said Njassane Omuaali, 21, was
killed during an exchange of gunfire and was among a ``band of
Moslems'' who fired on police.
   But Omuaali's grandmother, Elaine Bailey, said her grandson, the
son of Bakr's first wife, was killed after police seized him.
   ``They grabbed him, kicked him down the stairs and killed him.
They shot him,'' said Ms. Bailey, 75, in a telephone interview.
   She said Omuaali was scheduled to return Saturday to Washington,
where he was studying finance and accounting at Howard University
on a U.N. fellowship.
   In another development, Guyana sent 40 troops to Trinidad to
assist authorities. More than 100 other troops from Jamaica and
Barbados were assisting Trinidadian troops.
   A state of emergency remained in effect with a curfew in
Port-of-Spain from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. Soldiers and police were still
combing the city for any explosives that could have been left
behind in the coup attempt.
