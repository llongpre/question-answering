   The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago
said Thursday that U.S. authorities failed to tell his government
of arms purchases in Miami by Moslem coup-plotters.
   ``If we had the information possessed by U.S. authorities in
Miami, this coup would have been avoided,'' Prime Minister Arthur
N.R. Robinson told a news conference.
   Later, a U.S. State Department official, requesting anonymity,
said, ``We did not withhold information which would have enabled
Prime Minister Robinson to prevent the coup d'etat.''
   On July 27, Moslem militants stormed Parliament and the
government-run TV station and took the prime minister and more than
50 others hostage.
   The ensuing six-day siege and accompanying looting left 24
people dead and 500 wounded. Trinidad is a Caribbean island nation
of 1.2 million people off northeast Venezuela. The fighting caused
an estimated $60 million damage to the main shopping district in
Port-of-Spain.
   In answer to a question, Robinson said his government has
evidence the rebels had ties to Libya.
   ``In fact, the leader of the terrorist organization has
confessed openly about his visits and relations with Libya.''
   He declined to say, however, whether the coup was backed by
Libya, saying the case was in the courts.
   Rebel leader Yasin Abu Bakr, a former policeman who converted to
Islam, and 113 followers were jailed to face charges of treason and
murder after the coup was suppressed. Saying it fearing that Bakr's
supporters might be plotting another attack, the government
extended a state of emergency until mid-November. The proclamation
gives security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest.
   Robinson, who was shot in the leg by the rebels, said in a
speech to the United Nations General Assembly that the coup was
launched by ``a new breed of fanatics claiming divine inspiration,
but acting rather under satanic impulse.''
   Robinson walked with a cane as he went to the podium at U.N.
headquarters.
   After his speech, Robinson told reporters that he would raise
the issue of exchanging information about security when he meets
President Bush on Monday in Washington.
   ``We must find out why there was not a proper transfer of
information,'' he said. ``We want to ensure that in the future,
more effective arrangements are made about information exchange.''
   He said it was common knowledge that some of those later
involved in the coup were buying weapons in Miami with large
amounts of U.S. currency and shipping the arms to the island
nation, a former British colony.
   U.S. authorities in Miami knew about the arms purchases, he
said.
   ``Oh, yes,'' he said, ``there was much more information that
U.S. authorities had'' which was not passed along to his
government.
   Federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
arrested an Moslem, Louis Haneef of Pompano Beach, Fla., on charges
of supplying assault rifles, ammunition and other equipment to the
coup leaders.
   But Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the bureau in Washington,
said its agents were not aware of any contact between the man
buying the guns and Trinidad until after the coup attempt.
   ``Had it been known that the firearms were going to go to
Trinidad, the Trinidad authorities would have been notified,''
Killorin said. ``It simply was not known until Trinidad authorities
captured the arms and we matched them to the arms shipment in
Miami.''
   ``We couldn't agree more with the prime minister that
governments should set up avenues of communication to crack down on
this gun running,'' he added.
