   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Black Moslem rebel Abu Bakr, long
at odds with authorities, says their decision to spend $500,000 on
a memorial to a dead woman leader was the ``straw that broke the
camel's back.''
   Shortly after his followers seized Parliament house Friday, Bakr
commandeered the government television station and announced he had
overthrown Prime Minister Arthur Robinson and was holding him
hostage with his Cabinet.
   Speaking to the country on television, he accused Robinson's
4-year-old government of mismanagement and corruption. He singled
out Robinson's announcement on June 23 that a monument would be
built in honor of Jean Miles, a senior public servant who died more
than a decade ago.
   ``That was the straw that broke the camel's back: the allocation
of $500,000 to create a concrete statue to this woman, while poor
people all over the country are starving,'' he said.
   Bakr, a broad-shouldered, 6-foot-2-inch, charismatic leader, has
long considered himself a spokesman for the poor.
   A former mounted policeman who converted to Islam while studying
in Canada in the early 1980s, Bakr founded and has been the leader
for six years of the Jamaat al-Muslimeen commune. It is on eight
acres of former swamp land on the western edge of Port-of-Spain,
the capital.
   The rebel leader, in his late-40s, is married and has a son and
daughter believed to be attending the University of Toronto. His
wife, Annisa, is an executive for the Trinidad and Tobago
Industrial Development Corp.
   Another major source of friction with authorities is the city
council's contention that Bakr built his commune without a clear
title to the land.
   In the early 1970s, the late Prime Minister Eric Williams
donated the land to East Indian Moslems to build whatever they
wanted. But they never picked up the offer.
   Abu Bakr returned from Canada in 1984 and grabbed the land,
saying his black Moslems had a right to it.
   He built a mosque in the center and living quarters for his 250
to 300 followers. Four major buildings include a kitchen for the
poor and a large school.
   The dispute came to a head in the 1980s when Bakr was jailed for
several weeks for contempt of court when he failed to answer
charges of illegal occupation brought by the council.
   Over the years, the commune has been raided by police looking
for arms and ammunition. They found a few rifles and small amounts
of ammunition.
   Three months ago, police and defense force soldiers seized a
portion of the commune where Bakr was constructing a new building.
Bakr sought a court order to remove the troops.
   A week ago, High Court Judge Ivol Blackman ruled against Bakr.
   Another irritant was the government's recent refusal to
distribute free medical supplies and pharmaceuticals Bakr wanted to
donate to people of the island.
   He said he had received the supplies from a U.N. agency.
However, it was widely believed in Trinidad that they came from
Libya.
   Bakr is thought to receive financial support from Libya and has
visited that North African country several times.
   He has also been highly critical of the government's record on
fighting drugs and even formed a paramilitary squad to raid drug
dealers. This earned him the enmity of the police.
   Moslems in mostly Hindu and Christian Trinidad make up 6 percent
of the population of 1.3 million people.
   There are only a small number of black Moslems outside Bakr's
group. Most are East Indians, who consider the blacks as
opportunists guided by politics more than the Koran.
   A Moslem leader in Canada who knew Bakr when he converted to
Islam, said he was ``committed to social justice.''
   Hardon Salamat, head of the Toronto and Region Islamic
Congregation, said in an interview that he thinks Bakr's action
resulted from ``years and years of frustration and government
harassment.''
   Salamat said Bakr's group receives financing from Moslems around
the world, including those in Toronto and Montreal.
