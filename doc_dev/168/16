   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) - A magistrate ordered a delay
Thursday in the start of a hearing for Yasin Abu Bakr and 112 other
Moslem militants who captured the prime minister during a coup
attempt.
   Chief Magistrate Melville Baird granted a prosecution request
for an adjournment to allow more time to prepare its case. The
magistrate set Sept. 25 as the new date for the preliminary
hearing.
   Bakr, 48, a former policeman, and the members of his Jamaat
al-Muslimeen (Society of Moslems) face the death penalty for
charges that include murder and treason.
   About two dozen female Jamaat supporters shouted ``Allah
akbar!'' (God is great) as Bakr and 18 other prisoners filed into
the courtroom, where they were kept in a specially built iron cage
for the 45-minute proceedings.
   For security reasons, the remaining prisoners are to appear
later in four separate groups.
   Heavily armed soldiers in camouflage uniforms ringed the
converted gym in the western town of Chaguaramas, 10 miles outside
Port-of-Spain, for the Moslems' first court appearance since the
six-day coup attempt ended Aug. 1.
   Wearing a white tunic and black fez, the Moslem leader bowed to
reporters and said: ``Morning to the press. Morning everybody.''
   Spectators were searched and scanned with metal detectors before
entering the courtroom. An armored tank was positioned outside.
   Prosecutor Theodore Guerra said the newly appointed head of the
prosecution team, Karl Hudson-Phillips, needed more time to prepare
his case. Defense attorney Nathaniel King had no objection.
   Bakr and his followers captured the Parliament and state-run
television station and seized Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson
and more than 50 others, including several Cabinet members.
   The attack and subsequent looting left 24 dead. Robinson, 63,
was shot in the left leg. Bakr and his men are charged in
connection with eight deaths.
   Bakr had blamed Robinson's administration for widespread poverty
in this once oil-wealthy Caribbean nation off Venezuela.
   Trinidad and its sister island of Tobago remain under a state of
emergency, giving police wide powers of search and arrest, and a
nighttime curfew.
