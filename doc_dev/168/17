   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson was freed by his Moslem captors today but other officials
held hostage were not released, the government announced.
   Attorney General Anthony Smart gave no details of how and under
what conditions the prime minister, who had been shot in both feet
during the uprising, was freed. But the release of Robinson alone
indicated the 5-day-old standoff between the government and Moslem
extremists was not over.
   ``We continue to pray for the safe return of the rest of the
hostages,'' Smart told state radio.
   He said Robinson was the only one of the 41 hostages released.
   Smart said Robinson, who was freed at 1:20 p.m. EDT, ``is in
good spirits.''
   The siege began Friday when radical Moslems led by Abu Bakr
stormed Parliament and the government-run television station in
Trinidad's capital city. Bakr has accused the government of
mismanagement.
   The release came after a day of conflicting reports over the
progress of negotiations to end the hostage siege, which has
plunged this Caribbean nation of 1.3 million residents off
northeast Venezuela into chaos.
   On Monday night, Robinson had said by telephone that he had
accepted an agreement under which he would resign and Bakr and his
men would be granted amnesty.
   But government officials said today that no such agreement
existed and that Robinson had made the statement under duress.
   Bakr said earlier today that the rebels agreed that Winston
Dookeran, the deputy prime minister, would replace Robinson when he
steps down. Dookeran was released from the Parliament building
Friday.
   The interim government would be a coalition consisting of
representatives of all major political parties, along with Bakr's
Jamaat al-Muslimeen group.
   The group, which is believed to number 250 to 300, has blamed
Robinson for widespread poverty in this once-oil rich Caribbean
nation near Venezuela. It has little support among the populace.
   Bakr is a former policeman who converted to Islam in 1980 and
has long considered himself a champion of the downtrodden. He
founde Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which means the Moslem Group in Arabic,
in 1984.
   Robinson easily won parliamentary elections in 1986. Under the
constitution, the next elections don't have to be held until 1991.
   On Monday, security forces exchanged gunfire with the rebels at
Parliament and at the government television station. Three
buildings in and around the TV complex were set ablaze but no
injuries were reported.
   At least nine people _ six rebels, two police officers and a
civilian _ have been killed since the siege began, and the
instability has spawned massive looting in Trinidad and Tobago, a
two-island nation of 1.3 million people. State radio said some
looters were shot Monday but gave no details.
   Bakr has ties to Libya and it is believed he has received
funding from that country. In a conversation with local radio
today, he said he had no regrets over what he had done.
   ``I hope we can settle it in love,'' he said.
   Asked if the siege could end in violence, he said, ``Everyone
will die at some time in their lives.''
