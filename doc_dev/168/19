   The White House expressed ``strong
support'' Saturday for Trinidad's prime minister, a captive of
black Moslem rebels who took over the Caribbean island's parliament.
   President Bush was spending the weekend relaxing at his
oceanfront summer home here, but he and national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft were kept abreast of the attempted coup, a
spokeswoman said.
   Bush, who spent the morning on the tennis courts and boating,
attended the wedding of a second cousin in late afternoon.
   Deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said Bush and Scowcroft were
``following the situation carefully'' in Trinidad and Tobago, a
former British colony off the coast of Venezuela that gained
independence in 1962.
   ``We maintain our strong support for the Democratic government
of Prime Minister (Arthur) Robinson,'' Ms. Glen said.
   ``It appears that no American citizens are in any danger. The
situation seems limited to one building,'' she said.
   Trinidad and Tobago have not yet asked for help, but the United
States would consider the request if they do, she said.
   Robinson and several members of his cabinet were being held
hostage in the parliament in Port-of-Spain by rebels led by former
policeman Abu Bakr, leader of a Moslem sect that said it recognizes
no government but ``the law of almighty Allah.''
   Later, the State Department issued this written statement:
   ``We condemn yesterday's attempt by a violent extremist group to
overthrow the democratic government of Trinidad and Tobago. We call
upon the parties in this attempted coup to release the hostages
under their control and to surrender to the legislative
constitutional authority of Trinidad and Tobago. This violent
attack on the government has no support from the people of Trinidad
and Tobago who have enjoyed a long tradition of democratic
government. The United States fully supports the elected government
and is consulting closely with it and other interested governments
in the region.''
   An administration official who accompanied Bush to Maine said
the army was still loyal to the prime minister and his
four-year-old government.
   On another international hotspot, Liberia, Ms. Glen said, ``The
situation has not changed. We're following it closely.''
   The beleaguered government of President Samuel Doe has been
under siege for weeks in that West African nation. Rebel leader
Charles Taylor claimed Friday to have established his own
government, even though street fighting continued.
   Bush, getting a weekend respite from the drawn out negotiations
with Democrats over the budget deficit, brought his wife, Barbara,
daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, and several grandchildren with him
Friday on the flight from Washington to Pease Air Force Base in
Newington, N.H.
   He also gave his taciturn Supreme Court nominee, David H.
Souter, a ride home to New Hampshire. Before heading off to visit
his mother at a Concord nursing home, Souter said it felt ``damn
good'' to be back in the Granite State.
   This was the Bushes' third visit to their vacation home since
Memorial Day.
   President and Mrs. Bush attended the wedding of a second cousin,
Ruben Andrus Holden V, 37, of Marshfield, Mass., to Pamela Anne
Grindle, 35, of Boston, at St. Ann's Episcopal Church in
Kennebunkport.
   The stone church, which overlooks the Atlantic, is where the
Bushes attend Sunday services. Guests were required to walk through
a portable metal detector.
   Mrs. Bush will stay behind when the president heads back to the
White House on Sunday evening. The president will return here to
Walker's Point on Aug. 10 and stay until Labor Day.
