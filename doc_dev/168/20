   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) - ``Sorry for inconvenience caused
by the criminal acts of frenzied looters,'' reads the sign in the
window of the closed Hometown Pharmacy. ``We'll be back as soon as
possible.''
   The suburban drug store was among scores of businesses plundered
after Moslem militants stormed Parliament and the government-run TV
station on July 27 and took the prime minister and more than 50
others hostage.
   Nearly two months later, Trinidadians are still feeling
aftershocks of the six-day siege and accompanying looting that left
24 people dead and 500 wounded on this tiny nation of 1.2 million
inhabitants off the coast of Venezuela.
   The fighting delvered a shock to the ailing Trinidadian
economy, causing an estimated $60 million damage to the devastated
main shopping district of Port-of-Spain. Tourism, not surprisingly,
was also hurt.
   But there is a touch of irony in the fact that only hours after
rebel Yasin Abu Bakr and his followers surrendered Aug. 1, Iraq
invaded Kuwait, sending oil prices skyrocketing. Trinidad produces
just under 1 percent of the world's oil.
   The worst long-term damage may be to the nation's sense of
itself as a land of British-style democracy, multiracial harmony,
oil wealth, cricket and calypso.
   For Harmony Pharmacy owner Jeffrey Marchack, who lost his entire
inventory of $100,000 worth of drugs and merchandise, the episode
has meant a decision to install an iron grille in the front window
and a cashier's cage.
   Such security measures didn't seem necessary before, he said
nostalgically, because ``we were always known to be happy-go-lucky,
peace-loving people.''
   ``The myth of exceptionalism has been blown apart,'' said Selwyn
Ryan, a sociologist and political pollster at the University of the
West Indies. ``The myth that we're a nonviolent society is just
that - a myth.''
   Industry Minister Bhoe Tewarie said Bakr and his Jamaat
al-Muslimeen (Society of Moslems) were a ``group of extremists''
with no popular support. ``And I think Trinidad and Tobago proved
to the world that it is a very stable democracy that was threatened
but never shaken by the events of July 27.''
   But fearing that supporters of Bakr and 113 other jailed rebels
might be plotting another attack, the government has extended a
state of emergency until mid-November. The proclamation gives
security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest.
   By day, the capital of Port-of-Spain once again teems with
shoppers, street vendors and clogged traffic. Residents are growing
tired of being restricted to their homes at night under a 9
p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew.
   ``We cannot expect that their sense of humor, which as been
bearing up quite nicely until now, can be maintained for undefined
periods,'' the Trinidad Guardian said in an editorial urging an end
to the curfew.
   Police, usually armed only with billy clubs in this former
British colony, now patrol with automatic rifles. Soldiers wearing
berets and camouflage jungle fatigues guard the bullet-scarred
Parliament building and television station.
   The capital's major hotels are open, but with mostly empty
rooms.
   Bulldozers and dump trucks remove tons of rubble from the main
shopping district, where fires destroyed almost every building in a
two-square-block area.
   The government is offering business loans and planning to
redesign the district, which had become badly rundown.
   But rebuilding could take months, if not years.
   Industry Minister Tewarie insists the coup attempt would not
have any lasting affect the economy. Tourism was hurt in the short
term, he said, but the industry accounts for a tiny proportion of
the nation's wealth.
   Despite the boom in oil prices, Tewarie said, the government has
no plans to significantly increase production because it is wary of
increasing its dependence on oil income.
   Trinidad has been gripped by recession since oil prices
collapsed in 1983. Bakr, 48, a former policeman who converted to
Islam and drew followers mainly among poor urban blacks, blamed
Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson for the widespread poverty that
resulted.
   Robinson, 64, was shot in the left leg after the takeover of
Parliament. He has returned to work and now walks with a cane.
   The prime minister, who had introduced wage freezes, spending
cuts and layoffs to revitalize the economy, had become highly
unpopular before the coup attempt. He remains in danger of losing
the next election, due next year.
   Bakr and his men face a string of charges, including murder and
treason, which carry the death penalty. A preliminary hearing was
to begin today in a converted gym.
   The FBI has charged an American Moslem, Louis Haneef of Pompano
Beach, Fla., with supplying assault rifles, ammunition and other
equipment to the coup leaders.
