   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson and the chief negotiator for Moslem extremists said Monday
they have reached agreement to end a 4-day-old hostage siege.
   Robinson is one of 41 hostages reported held since Friday by
black Moslem extremists led by Abu Bakr.
   Justice and National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson,
speakig from inside Parliament where the uprising began, said the
agreement called for Robinson's immediate resignation with
elections to be held within 90 days.
   Richardson said the government had granted amnesty to the Moslem
radicals involved in the insurgency, which has left at least nine
people dead, according to officials.
   Speaking by telephone from inside Parliament, Robinson said the
agreement was reached after ``very difficult bargaining.''
   The prime minister said he instructed Col. Joe Theodore, head of
the Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force, to ``make necessary
arrangements for the evacuation (of hostages and rebels) as soon as
possible.''
   Chief rebel negotiator Bilal Abdullah, speaking next on the
telephone, said: ``I wish to totally corroborate what Prime
Minister Robinson has just said.''
   Army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams reported earlier Monday that
the Moslems were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, pistols and
grenades.
   In the first official casualty count, Williams said at least
nine people had died in the fighting since Friday. He said Anglican
negotiator Knolly Clarke told him additional bodies were inside the
parliament building, but it was not known how many.
   Trinidad is just off northeast Venezuela, and is a former
British colony that gained independence in 1962. It has been
wracked in recent years by declining oil revenues and economic
doldrums, including high unemployment.
