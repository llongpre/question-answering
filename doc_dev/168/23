   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook people
awake on the Caribbean island of Trinidad early today but police
said they had no reports of injuries or damage.
   The quake, the strongest in the area in 78 years, measured 6.9
on the Richter scale and struck at 2:17 a.m. about 50 miles
southeast of the capital of Port-of-Spain, said the U.S. Geological
Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   ``No damage, no injuries. We just got a little shake and that's
all,'' said Lt. Velfukr Muhammed at police headquarters in the
capital of 55,800 people.
   ``I was in bed at the time and that woke me and everyone else in
the house,'' said Lionel Dixon, news editor of Radio Trinidad in
Port-of-Spain.
   A security guard at the station, San Keralli, said the building
shook for about 40 seconds. Dixon said some people ran into the
street in the suburb where he lives.
   Frank Baldwin, a USGS physical science technician in Golden,
said the epicenter appeared to have been in the Caribbean about 420
miles east of Caracas, Venezuela, in a seismic area lying on the
boundary between the Caribbean and the South American crustal
plates of the Earth.
   The quake was the area's largest since a magnitude 7.2 temblor
on Jan. 23, 1910.
   Trinidad is an island in the republic of Trinidad and Tobago, a
member of the British Commonwealth. About 1.2 million people live
in the oil-producing republic, which covers an area about the size
of Delaware and is one of the Caribbean's most prosperous countries.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage.
