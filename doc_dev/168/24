   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Soldiers removed seven more
bodies Friday from a bombed police station, the Parliament and a TV
building, raising to at least 38 the death toll from a failed coup
attempt and subsequent looting.
   Moslem extremists held hostages for six days before surrendering
Wednesday.
   Army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams said seven additional bodies
were recovered by noon from wrecked buildings.
   Authorities also said that a fire of undetermined origin
destroyed a storage area and an apartment Thursday night at the
Jamaat al-Muslimeen commune's compound on the outskirts of
Port-of-Spain, the capital of this Caribbean island.
   Abu Bakr, the commune's leader, and 112 of his followers were
being held at army headquarters after giving up on Wednesday and
releasing their remaining 46 hostages. Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson and several of his Cabinet ministers were among the total
of 55 hostages held by the rebels.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw has said the militants could
face a variety of charges, including murder, kidnapping and
treason, which carries the death penalty.
   Shaw said Jazeni Omowale, a 21-year-old student from Howard
University in Washington, D.C., had been killed Wednesday in a
gunfight involving police and soldiers in the capital's Champs
Fleurs suburb. He was believed to be Bakr's stepson. The
circumstances of the gunfight were unknown.
   For the first time since the siege began on July 27, soldiers
entered the Parliament building.
   Williams said the bodies of three civilians and one rebel were
removed from the building, along with homemade grenades and about
40 handguns.
   He said two other bodies were pulled from the rubble of the
police station. The building was demolished by a car bomb and fire
during the siege.
   A seventh body, that of a rebel, was discovered at the
government's television station, where 29 employees were held
captive. Police sealed off the television station to search for any
explosives left by rebels.
   Shaw said earlier at least 30 people were killed in the initial
assault by Bakr and his men and in subsequent looting. The
discovery of the bodies Friday and the killing of the American
student brought the total to 38.
   Lennox Williams, administrator of Port-of-Spain General
Hospital, said autopsies found at least 14 people died of gunshot
wounds. He said most were killed by security forces during looting.
   A state of emergency remained in effect Friday and soldiers and
police patrolled the capital. An 18-hour curfew was reduced to 10
a.m. to 6 p.m., however, and Shaw said banks would open Sunday to
help residents resume normal business as soon as possible.
   A 150-member regional force was dispatched to this island nation
of more than 1.2 million to guard installations and relieve the
local forces for patrols.
   Food and medical supplies were being flown in from the United
States, Canada and nearby Venezuela.
