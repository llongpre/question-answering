Muslim rebels still held the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago and at least 
38 other hostages Sunday as negotiations to end the twin-island nation's crisis 
stalled amid reports of widespread looting and an early morning gun battle at 
one of the hostage sites. 
</P>
<P>
News agencies, quoting an executive of Trinidad's state-owned television 
station, said that Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson had offered to resign and 
call early elections in return for the hostages' freedom. But there was no 
confirmation of that report from other government sources. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Muslim group attempting the coup said that a final 
agreement on amnesty for the armed rebels was close. But a government source 
quoted by the Caribbean News Agency (CANA) in Barbados said that the 
negotiations were snagged over legal terms and by reservations being voiced by 
Trinidad's police and armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
No further mention was made Sunday of reports that Robinson and other hostages 
had been wired to explosive devices and threatened with death in the event of 
any armed rescue attempt. Robinson and 11 Cabinet ministers and members of 
Parliament are captives inside Trinidad's Red House, the Parliament building in 
downtown Port of Spain, the capital. Between 26 and 28 other captives are being 
held in two buildings of the state-run Trinidad and Tobago Television and Radio 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
A gun battle between the police and members of the armed Jamaat al Muslimeen 
rebel group broke out early Sunday at the television station, CANA reported. It 
quoted the station's news director, Jones P. Madeira, himself a hostage, as 
saying that two of the Muslims were wounded. A shortwave radio broadcast, 
purportedly made by Robinson, appealed for a cease-fire, CANA said. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency also quoted extensively from an interview with Yasin abu Bakr, 
leader of Jamaat al Muslimeen, Arabic for "Group of Muslims," in which he 
denied "malicious propaganda" that his movement was supported by Libya's 
radical leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, and that the rebels had asked to be flown 
to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to Libya for?" the CANA interview quoted Abu Bakr as asking. 
"We are all Trinidadians, that is why we are here, that is why we are fighting 
in any case, because it is our country. There is nothing to do with Libya." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by telephone to CANA from the television station, Abu Bakr said that 
the armed uprising was launched because "something had to shock us into 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
The offer that Robinson reportedly made to step down and call early elections 
was described by TV news director Madeira, according to an Associated Press 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"My information is that Prime Minister Robinson has agreed to step down and 
that an interim government of major political parties will run the country 
until elections are held in 90 days," Madeira was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson won the parliamentary elections by a landslide in 1986, and the next 
elections are not scheduled until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakr's group of 200 to 250 followers and their families, organized about 
six years ago, has long been viewed with suspicion by the government as violent 
outlaws. Abu Bakr, a former police officer in his mid-40s, has in turn accused 
the government of corruption, squandering state money and failing to focus on 
hunger and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Robinson, who was shot in the leg when he refused to sign a 
document that some reports described as a letter of resignation, Abu Bakr told 
CANA, "All is well at the Red House," the Parliament building where the prime 
minister and other officials are held captive. "There has been a great spirit 
of compromise between our members and Mr. Robinson and some of the members of 
Parliament," Abu Bakr was quoted as saying. "Hopefully the country will be back 
on its feet in a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
Two other political leaders, National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson and 
Parliament member Leo Des Vignes also were shot in the legs, according to a 
news report from Port of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, officials said that U.S. and Trinidadian officials have 
consulted in the past two days on the possibility of sending State Department 
experts in hostage negotiations to the island. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Sean Walsh said Sunday that the United States is "willing 
to entertain any proposal by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, and will 
examine any request carefully." But Walsh said that Trinidad has made no formal 
requests for assistance and that officials in Washington believe that Trinidad 
hopes to resolve the crisis itself. 
</P>
<P>
Any U.S. military assistance was considered highly unlikely, officials said, 
both because Trinidad is not likely to request such help and because Washington 
probably would not approve such a move. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ransacking and pillaging of stores and shopping centers in what 
has become the virtual no man's land of downtown Port of Spain continued 
Sunday, according to news reports reaching here. Acting Police Commissioner 
Leonard Taylor acknowledged that "our best efforts haven't provided the desired 
results," but he warned of "stronger measures which will certainly be injurious 
to some citizens." 
</P>
<P>
In a radio appeal to end the looting, Anglican Bishop Clive Abdullah said he 
had been told that whole convoys of vehicles were loading up on refrigerators 
and videos. 
</P>
<P>
A Port of Spain businessman was quoted as complaining that too many of the tiny 
island country's 1,500 military troops and 5,000 police were concentrated at 
the hostage sites, leaving the city wide open to the looters. As the crisis 
entered its third day, he estimated losses at more than $50 million. At least 
27 people, including police and military personnel, have reportedly been killed 
in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Abdullah, Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Pantin and Anglican 
clergyman Knolly Clarke have been acting as middlemen in the negotiations 
between the Muslim group and the government. In exchange for ending the crisis 
peacefully, the rebels reportedly have asked for a total amnesty, including 
legal pardons from the Commonwealth country's president. 
</P>
<P>
"All the principles have been agreed, and the final arrangements for conducting 
the amnesty are being concluded with the assistance of Archbishop of Port of 
Spain Pantin and Anglican Bishop Abdullah," said the Muslim group's spokesman, 
Bilal Abdullah, in a telephone interview with CANA from the TV station. 
</P>
<P>
A strict 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew continued in Port of Spain. Although Piarco 
International Airport, the country's main link to the outside world, was 
technically reopened during daylight hours Sunday, international and local 
Caribbean airlines refused to resume service until the crisis is resolved. 
Charter pilots on nearby Caribbean islands such as Barbados and Grenada also 
refused to fly to Port of Spain.
