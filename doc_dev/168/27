<F P=106> [Article by Camini Marajh: "Drug Bust Mystery: Why Always </F>
Abroad?"] 
  [Text] Local law enforcers have denied that there is an 
unwritten policy to have arrests and seizures of drugs coming 
from Trinidad and Tobago take place outside this country's 
territory. 
  Still, no one could say why all of the major drug busts with 
clear Trinidad and Tobago connections are taking place 
everywhere--in Savannah, Georgia; Wilmington, North Carolina; 
Frankfurt, Germany, and on Monday in Grenada--but here. 
  Repeated calls to National Security Minister Russell Huggins 
and Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Chief Lance Selman went 
unreturned up to late Friday. 
  Law enforcement sources said in both shipping 
incidents--involving the methanol tanker Harold La 
Borde and the schooner Let Me Live--local police 
had prior knowledge that there were drugs on board. A combined 
total of 134 kilograms of cocaine were seized from both vessels 
in places outside Trinidad and Tobago. 
  The Ministry of National Security has gone a step further 
and 
rushed to take credit for the drug busts, citing collaboration 
between local authorities and their foreign counterparts in an 
official government press release. 
  Despite this, no one could say why, if information was 
available that there were drugs on board the methanol tanker and 
on the inter-island schooner, the bust was not made here by 
local narcotics or Coast Guard officers, instead of allowing the 
US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Grenada Coast 
Guard to break those two smuggling operations. 
  In the case of the Harold La Borde the DEA gave 
credit to a local informant who was paid "good money" by the US 
counter-narcotics agency for supplying information that led to 
the drug bust and the arrest of four Trinidadians. 
  Pierre Sharette, assistant special agent of the DEA Miami 
office with responsibility for the Caribbean, told the SUNDAY 
EXPRESS that month that the mystery Trinidadian had no 
connection to law enforcement agencies. 
  Current bids for credit by local officials recall the 
episode 
two years ago when the Narcotics Bureau claimed credit for the 
Florida arrest by US authorities of Paul Mansoor with five 
kilograms of cocaine. 
  Vexed by the false claim, a US source later told this 
newspaper that Mansoor was picked up in Miami because he was 
acting suspicously, and not as a result of any tip-off from the 
T&amp;T police. 
  Sources say that neither of the shipping incidents was a 
"controlled delivery"--the reason, some people believe, for the 
failure of local authorities to act on the information here. 
  In the latest bust, local authorities said, they tipped off 
the DEA, who in turn alerted the Grenada Coast Guard that drugs 
were stashed in hidden compartments in furniture stored on the 
schooner. Why local authorities did not themselves intercept the 
drugs but allowed the ship to leave the Caricom jetty and sail 
clear out of T&amp;T waters has not been explained. 
  A top policeman would say only that "we were aware of it 
(drugs on board the schooner)." Pressed further, he said: "The 
information is very sensitive." 
  He claimed that authorities here "are aware of the local 
connection" in both drug runs. He added only that: "We have an 
idea what's going on (in the drug business)." 
  He refused to say why, if the authorities know who the local 
dealers are, there have been no arrests as yet--or rather, the 
arrests that have been made comprise mainly drug mules held on 
outbound flights at Piarco International Airport and low-level 
street dealers. 
  Earlier this month, a Trinidadian was arrested in Germany 
with four kilograms of cocaine. He was a passenger on BWIA 
flight 980--Port of Spain to Frankfurt. 
  Suspicions created since charges last year about a police 
"drug cartel" have slowed the sharing of information even 
between the newly created narcotics unit and Selman's OSS. Each 
agency is reported to be guarding information jealously and 
sharing it "on a need to know basis only." 
  There is no explanation either why there are no busts for 
drugs coming into Trinidad and Tobago, or how much of 
what comes in remains here. 
  Law enforcement authorities say they are unable to keep pace 
with the sophisticated craft and ingenious methods employed by 
traffickers and predict even tougher times ahead with the major 
shift in US drug policy. 
  The Clinton administration announced it will slash drug 
interdictions efforts using warships and aircraft in the 
Caribbean and pump more aid to South America to fight cocaine at 
the source. 
  Sharette had told the SUNDAY EXPRESS that Trinidad and 
Tobago 
is being used as a "staging area" by the Medellin and Cali 
cartels to move drugs to Europe and North America. 
  Sharette said DEA intelligence indicates that single and 
twin-engine aircraft have been making drug airdrops in Trinidad 
and Tobago territorial waters. Boats pick up the drug cargo for 
repackaging and shipping to Europe and North America. 
  Meanwhile, despite Huggins' vow to get tough, cocaine 
cartels 
continue to bring their drugs into Trinidad and Tobago and, as 
evidenced by recent seizures and arrests, to take at least some 
of it out.
