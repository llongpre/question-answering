  [Text] Witnesses in drug cases in Trinidad and Tobago are 
so easily bought off that the Ministry of National Security is 
putting focus on the seizure of drugs outside of Trinidad and 
Tobago as a deliberate policy. 
  This was stated by National Security Minister Russell 
Huggins 
in the Senate yesterday. 
  Noting that there was criticism that the big drug busts were 
not taking place in Trinidad and Tobago, but outside, Huggins 
said the seizing of drugs outside of Trinidad was "an 
intentional act." 
  "Witnesses (in Trinidad and Tobago) are being bought off as 
easy as it is to buy a soft drink in a parlour. We start a case, 
we have four state witnesses and by the time the matter comes 
up, you can't find any of them. They are in the United States 
living it up," he said. 
  He explained that as a result of this the Ministry had taken 
a particular approach to the busting of drug deals. 
  "When we find out about it (we arrange) to have it seized 
outside of Trinidad and not inside," he said, adding: 
  "We will work with agencies outside of Trinidad and Tobago 
and I can tell you that it was largely as a result of our effort 
that a drug link between this country and Venezuela was 
destroyed recently." 
  Huggins noted that one of the main perpetrators, a 
Trinidadian received a 10-year jail sentence within eight days 
of his arrest. 
  "Now that is the kind of swift justice I will like to see 
here. But we have skilled lawyers who know how to delay justice 
when it suits them," he added. 
  The Minister also referred to a recent bust "as far as 
Holland" in which both the narcotic units here and the OSS 
(Organisation of Strategic Services) played an important role in 
the discovery of shipment of drugs on board a British Airways 
craft leaving Piarco. 
  Huggins noted that the task of preventing drugs from coming 
into Trinidad and Tobago was far more difficult. Those who 
import cocaine have a lot of opportunity to do so, he said, 
adding that the south-eastern coast, given the present size of 
our Coast Guard, was impossible to patrol on a full-time basis. 
  He recalled that only recently the Coast Guard had acquired 
boats with the capability to chase the small fast boats used by 
drug traffickers. 
  Turning to the Point Lisas Port, he noted that it was 
virtually impossible to search 1,000 containers. 
  "The only way you can do it is by random checks and a 
container may slip by and the government and the security at 
Point Lisas are blamed," he noted. 
  He said that while Point Lisas had put in a very good system 
to deal with that, it was virtually impossible to completely 
eradicate the problem. 
  He stressed that good intelligence in detecting the drugs 
was 
still the best option and urged citizens to assist the 
authorities in this regard. 
  Huggins said the U.S. Government had provided govenrment 
with 
US$303,000; the Canadian Government $1 million, the French 
Government had given technical assistance as did the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police. 
  But, he stressed, foreign assistance was extremely difficult 
to access. "Although public pronouncements are made that some 
governments are providing assistance, because of the bureaucracy 
involved, that assistance is extremely difficult to get our 
hands on," he said. 
  He said on regional basis--Caribbean Financial Action Task 
Force--was established to deal with the problem of money 
laundering.
