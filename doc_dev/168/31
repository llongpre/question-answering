  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 8 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad and 
Tobago's police commissioner, Jules Bernard, has issued a stern 
warning to Muslim leader Yasin Abu Bakr [name as received], 
whose followers staged a coup attempt here in 1990. 
  "I wish to advise all concerned that the police service, as 
the state agency charged with the responsibility to maintain law 
and order in the society, would take prompt and decisive action 
to deal with any attempt to disrupt the peace, order and 
tranquility of the society," Bernard said after Abu Bakr said 
his group felt as "oppressed" as it had when it staged the 
insurrection. 
  "It is important that all persons who may be inclined to 
embark on a path of unconventional behaviour be warned that the 
police would be vigilant and prepared to deal with any such 
activities." 
  Bakr, during a news conference, expressed dissatisfaction 
over the long time the court of appeal took in delivering the 
judgment in the dispute over lands the Muslimeen claims at 
Mucurapo in the northern township of St James. 
  The Muslim leader said his organisation had many options 
open 
to it regarding the land dispute with the government. 
  "We can't just starve to death and do nothing. The 
government is treating us unjustly. We have many options and we 
would not sit and do nothing. We will use the best option 
available to us," he told reporters. 
  He said that the organisation was not doing anything to 
create tension. 
  Abu Bakr added,"we are feeling oppressed and we would like 
to 
defend ourselves. "The same kind of oppression resulted in the 
1990 insurrection." 
  The Muslimeen held parliamentarians hostage in 1990, 
complaining of victimisation and economic hardships. Bakr and 
113 followers who gave themselves up afterwards were freed in 
1992 after a high court found that an amnesty which they 
received from acting President Emmanuel Carter was valid. 
  Previous governments and the Muslimeen have been at 
loggerheads over the ownership of the land, which eventually 
ended up in the courts. 
  Bakr, at the news conference, also complained that the state 
had failed to pay compension for the destruction of several 
buildings on the Mucurapo lands which were gutted by fire, 
shortly after the six-day siege of parliament.
