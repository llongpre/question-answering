   The United States is preparing
emergency assistance for this beleaguered Caribbean country, but
there are no plans to send military reinforcements, the U.S.
ambassador said Tuesday.
   ``We haven't been asked and we aren't considering any type of
military support,'' Ambassador Charles Gargano said at the U.S.
Embassy, a few blocks from the state Television House where a
radical Moslem group has held hostages since Friday.
   The group also seized the Parliament House and is holding
hostages there, including government officials. Prime Minister
Arthur N.R. Robinson was freed Tuesday, five days after being
seized, the attorney general said.
   Because of widespread looting, Trinidad could face food
shortages, and the United States is preparing emergency supplies,
Gargano said.
   He said a force of some 200 Caribbean soldiers were standing by
on Barbados to help if requested.
   The ambassador, who has been staying in the Embassy along with
12 other diplomatic personnel and six Marine guards, said he is in
regular contact with Trinidadian officials.
   He said there are no signs of splintering in the government or
security forces, and there is no popular support for the rebels.
   ``The government is in total control of the country,'' he said.
   Gargano, named in 1987, said the crisis ``came out of the blue
for us. In fact, we were quite shocked. This country appeared to be
a model of democracy.''
   The U.S. stakes here are high, he said. He said there are 2,000
to 4,000 U.S. citizens in Trinidad, including many Trinidadians who
hold dual citizenship.
   Trinidad is a major U.S. trade partner in the Caribbean and has
been a pro-American democracy for its three decades of nationhood,
he said.
   ``Things have been moving apace in terms of democratization in
this hemisphere. We would like to see it continue as a strong
democracy,'' Gargano said.
   He said the Moslem group led by former Trinidad policeman Abu
Bakr has been controversial in Trinidad and has made anti-American
statements.
   ``Our impression is that it was a tiny fanatical sect,'' he
said, estimating Bakr's followers at 250 to 350 people.
   He said some members of the group have traveled to Libya and
``there is some evidence of training given to some members.'' He
said they also have received funding from Libya. But Gargano added
there was no evidence of Libyan involvement in their move against
the government.
