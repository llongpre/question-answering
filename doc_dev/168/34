  [Text] Foreign missions in Trinidad and Tobago have come 
together to assist the Government in tackling the illicit drug 
trade. 
  Officials at the French Embassy, the UK High Commission, the 
US Embassy and the Canadian High Commission said last week that 
they hold ad hoc, informal meetings to consider the requirements 
of the T&amp;T Government and how best they can each serve these 
needs. 
  The objective of these meetings, they say, is to exchange 
information so that projects are co-ordinated and to ensure that 
efforts are not duplicated. 
  The French have been identified as the experts on money 
laundering, the Canadians on training and equipment, the US on 
drug interdiction and the British on training. 
  Jacques Venne, delegate for the Eastern Caribbean Technical 
and International Police Co-operation (SCTIP) attached to the 
French Embassy, said that Trinidad and Tobago was designated the 
regional centre of SCTIP operations on September 27. Director of 
SCTIP (International) Jean-Louise Ottavi visited for the opening 
on his way to Aruba to attend an Interpol Conference. 
  This country, he said, was chosen because of its 
geographical 
location and because of this Government's interest in dealing 
with the illicit drug trade. The Jamaican office, he added, was 
closed in favour of reinforcing the newly-opened centre in 
Trinidad and Tobago. 
  The Paris Government, he said, has already released "a good 
budget" for training a special team of police officers in money 
laundering, starting from the end of October. The officers are 
expected to undergo an intensive training session in Martinique. 
  Emphasising that his Embassy offers assistance on the basis 
of discussions with this Government, Venne said: "We are here as 
advisers, not to say what to do." 
  Head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Lance Selman 
pointed out that the Customs and Excise Division as well as the 
banking sector needed to be educated about money laundering. 
"One can't talk of counter-narcotics and not money laundering. 
In the final analysis it is money that drives the trade," he 
commented. 
  His office, Selman said, has been mandated to develop the 
capabilities to deal with money laundering. 
  Stating that his country's contribution has been "very 
modest" to date, Canadian High Commissioner Jean Nadeau said on 
Friday that Canada has been offering participation in short-term 
observer/attendance programmes. These exercises, he explained, 
involved exposure to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in their 
drug control operations. 
  Two T&amp;T officers will be attending such a session later 
this 
month. Besides training sessions, Nadeau said, Canada has 
donated a small amount of communications equipment to the 
Ministry of National Security and has made a financial 
commitment to assist in the renovation of the Narcotics Unit. 
  Indirectly, the Canadian Government has also provided 
assistance to Trinidad and Tobago, he said, through a 1992 
contribution of Can$800,000 to the Inter-American Drug Control 
Commission (CICAD) and Can$2.5 million to the United Nations 
International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). 
  Canada, said Nadeau, is also discussing with Trinidad and 
Tobago the setting up [of] a communications trunking system 
linking the protective services and perhaps Customs and Excise. 
  Press officer at the British High Commission Simon Bond said 
that the UK is placing emphasis on training especially in money 
laundering within the Customs and Excise Division. 
  "In the past we have given small-scale material assistance 
to 
the police and Coast Guard. But more significant from the UK's 
point of view is training. We also give advice in terms of 
legislative drafting in the drug area," Bond said. 
  Besides donating vehicles and equipment to the protective 
services, the US Government in August funded a US$18,000 drug 
prevention programme aimed at young people.
