  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 25 Jan, CANA -- The 
Trinidad and Tobago Government will accelerate its efforts to 
recover money owed to it by at least six Caribbean Community 
(Caricom) countries, a government minister reported Tuesday. 
  "This process was started by the Ministry of Finance in 
1993. In 1994, the minister of finance will attempt to 
accelerate the process through direct contact with his 
counterparts in the defaulting countries," Junior Finance 
Minister Ken Valley said in the Senate. 
  "These efforts are expected to culminate in 1994 with the 
full regularisation of the arrears." He named Antigua and 
Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines as countries not currently servicing all of 
their liabilities to Trinidad and Tobago. 
  "In some instances, no terms and conditions were determined 
for the repayment of the advances," he reported. "It is also the 
case in many instances that the countries defaulted several 
years ago. At this point, therefore, it has become necessary to 
verify the outstanding balances before the full recovery can be 
negotiated." At the end of December last year, U.S.517 million 
dollars was due to Trinidad and Tobago by its Caricom partners. 
The money represents only the bilateral portion of Trinidad and 
Tobago's debt portfolio. The multilateral arrears under the 
collapsed Caricom multilateral clearing facility amounted to 
almost 33 million dollars at the end of last year. 
  Out of the indebted countries, only Belize and St. Kitts are 
fully current and to-date they have repaid principal sums of TT 
65,620 dollars and 1,555,914 dollars (one TT dollar = 17.5 U.S. 
cents) respectively on the original loan balances, the minister 
said. Antigua and Barbuda owed U.S.2.5 million dollars; Dominica 
1.3 million dollars; Grenada over 600,000 dollars; Jamaica 
97,000 dollars; St. Lucia 388,000 dollars; and St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines 100,000 dollars. The Trinidad and Tobago 
Government was expected to sign, early this year, a bilateral 
agreement with the Government of Guyana, whose bilateral 
liability to the government here and the central bank was 
U.S.487 million dollars or 94 percent of the total debt. The 
Guyana debt was restructured in 1989 but subsequently fell into 
arrears. In August last year, a team of government officials 
from Trinidad met with Guyanese counterparts to negotiate a 
memorandum of understanding for the consolidation of the debt. A 
memorandum was signed by both governments and forms the basis of 
a bilateral agreement between both countries. 
  The agreement provides for the liquidation of the arrears of 
34.5 million dollars which was due from August 1990 to July 
1993. The agreement provides for a rescheduling of these arrears 
over a twelve-year period with a six-month moratorium on 
principal repayment. The 1993 agreement also provides for two 
semi-annual payments of 10.5 million dollars in 1994 and similar 
amounts in 1995 and 1996. 
  "Payments falling due under this agreement may be reduced by 
a range of debt conversion techniques including debt-equity 
swaps," said Valley. In pursuit of debt-equity swap 
opportunities, in March this year, the government is mounting an 
investment and trade mission to Guyana. The aim of the mission 
is to identify businesses in Guyana in which the participants, 
both from the private and state enterprises sectors, will be 
prepared to make equity investments." 
  With regard to the recovery of the amounts due to the 
Trinidad and Tobago Government and central bank by the 
government and Central Bank of Barbados, both governments last 
December signed a memorandum of understanding. The memorandum 
provides for the set-off of the government of Trinidad and 
Tobago's share of the liability of the cargo airline Caricargo 
to the Barbados National Bank against the debt of the Government 
of Barbados and the Central Bank of Barbados to Trinidad and 
Tobago. 
  Caricargo's debt to the Bank of Barbados is Bds59 million 
dollars (one Bds dollar = 50 U.S. cents) with Trinidad and 
Tobago's share being 29.5 million dollars. 
  The debt set-off will result in Barbados' U.S.25 million 
dollar liability being reduced by U.S.15.3 million dollars.
