  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 10 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad 
and Tobago's attorney general Keith Sobion said Sunday 
government will not be pressured into making a decision on a 
land dispute with the Jamaat al Muslimeen. 
  Leader of the Muslimeen, Yasin Abu Bakr, who led the 1990 
coup attempt on a former government here, said Friday his 
organisation had suffered "injustices" at the hands of the state 
and would not sit idly by should the appeal court not deliver 
judgement on the land dispute. 
  In a statement following a strongly-worded warning by the 
commissioner of police, Sobion said government was committed to 
the rule of law, and fully respected the role and function of 
the judiciary. 
  "It will not be party to any attempt to subvert the rule of 
law or indeed to manipulate the judiciary. Moreover, the 
government is confident that the judiciary will not itself 
rebuff any attempt, whether by the government or otherwise, to 
subvert or manipulate its processes. Any suggestion to the 
contrary is patently groundless. The government itself will not 
be pressured into making any decision relating to this matter," 
he said. 
  Sobion noted that there were essentially two issues relating 
to the lands at Mucurapo Road, in the northern township of St. 
James. The first is about the status of persons living there, 
and [the other] is the liability of the state for the demolition 
of certain buildings shortly after the end of the six-day siege. 
  Following a press conference called by Bakr, Commissioner of 
Police Jules Bernard condemned the statements as threats, saying 
the police were ready to deal with anyone who threatened to 
disturb the peace.
