   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem radicals freed an ailing
and wounded Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson on Tuesday, four
days after they took him and 40 other people hostage in a coup
attempt, the attorney general said.
   The other hostages, including 15 government officials, were
still held, Attorney General Anthony Smart said. He refused to say
what conditions led to the 63-year-old Robinson's release.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk confirmed
Robinson was freed and said, ``We hope the situation can be
resolved in a quick and peaceful manner.''
   But Smart told reporters, ``This crisis is far from over.''
   He said the government in this Caribbean nation of 1.3 million
residents was continuing efforts to win the release of the others
held by former policeman Abu Bakr and his band of Moslem extremists.
   ``These discussions are at a very delicate stage,'' with lives
at stake, he said.
   The hostages were seized Friday by extremists who captured the
Parliament building and the government TV station about one mile
away. At least nine people were yle.''
   Attorneys representing the families of Raymond Belknap and James
Vance claim those lines on the band's ``Stained Class'' album
contain the subliminal message ``do it'' that prompted the youths
to shoot themselves in a deserted church playground Dec. 23, 1985.
   Belknap, 18, died immediately. Vance, then 20, blew away most of
his face but lived three more years, undergoing several operations,
before he died on Thanksgiving Day 1988 of complications from his
injuries and the various medications he was taking.
   The band and CBS Records deny any hidden messages exist. They
counter that the supposed ``do it'' sounds are an exhalation of
breath, and a combination of drums, guitars and vocals.
   ``The sounds I hear are essentially my own exhalation of breath
at the end of the line I am singing,'' Halford testified.
   ``There are no subliminals of any nature'' either in the song or
on the album, he said.
   Halford testified that the song ``Better by You, Better than
Me,'' was the only song on the 1978 album that wasn't written by
band members.
