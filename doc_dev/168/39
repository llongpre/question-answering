   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Assailants shot into President
Noor Hassanali's limousine, but the president was not inside and his
wife narrowly escaped the attack unharmed, police said.
   Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson refused to speculate on a motive
for the attack but told Parliament Friday that ``all measures to
catch the perpetrators have been put in place, and I urge the public
to remain calm.''
   The attack occurred Thursday night when Hassanali's wife,
Zaylahar, 65, was returning home in the limousine. Police
Superintendent Sorzano Araetes said three men attacked 200 yards
from the couple's home on the outskirts of Port-of-Spain.
   ``A white Mazda vehicle pulled up alongside and shots were fired
into the presidential car, barely missing the president's wife,''
and other bullets hit the side of the limousine, Araetes said.
   The chauffeur also escaped injury, he said.
   Araetes said police found the attack car Friday, with AK-47 shell
casings inside.
   Hassanali, 68, a retired Supreme Court judge, became president in
1987 and has avoided controversy. The post of is ceremonial.
   Trinidad and Tobago, a two-island state of 1.2 million people in
the southern Caribbean off South America, gained independence from
Britain in 1962.
