   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Abu Bakr, the Moslem leader whose
rebels captured the prime minister and his Cabinet in a coup
attempt, has been fighting with the government for years.
   Most recently, Bakr has been involved in a dispute over medical
supplies and pharmaceuticals reportedly donated by Libya and
prohibited by customs agents from entering the country.
   One of the first things Bakr did after taking the leaders
captive was accuse the government of refusing to let him distribute
free medicine to the poor people of Trinidad and Tobago.
   Members of his sect, Jamaat al-Muslimeen, have long been
perceived by many Trinidadians as violent outlaws, although they
proclaim moralistic motives for their actions.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, founded Jamaat al-Muslimeen, Arabic for
``Group of Moslems,'' six years ago.
   He has said he does not recognize ``man's laws,'' but only ``the
law of almighty Allah.''
   On Friday, he said he understood ``the present suffering of the
people'' and that Prime Minister Arthur Robinson had been
overthrown by God.
   ``God has removed him,'' Bakr said on government television.
``No man, including me, has power. ... He gave us victory over the
prime minister.''
   Bakr, his 200 to 250 followers and their wives and children live
on a commune in western Port-of-Spain.
   In 1988, police raided the commune, seizing weapons and
ammunition and arresting 34 members of the sect on charges of
larceny, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, rape and murder.
   Bakr, a former policeman, said then his vigilantes were waging a
war against ``the menace of cocaine.''
   On Friday, he said, ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and
drugs which there was no hope for the present regime to stop.''
   Moslems make up 6 percent of the population of Trinidad and
Tobago, a former British colony just off the northeast coast of
Venezuela. Of the nation's 1.3 million people, about 40 percent are
of African descent and the same proportion is of East Indian
descent.
   Most of the East Indians are Hindu. Most of the Africans are
Roman Catholic or Protestant. The nation's small Moslem population
is mostly East Indians with some Africans. But the black Moslem
population has grown since the black power movement began 20 years
ago, and Bakr's sect is the largest among them.
