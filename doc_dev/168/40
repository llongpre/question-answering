   Behind the sun, sand and carefree
islanders of the tourist brochures lies another Caribbean of
hardship and frustration that is a breeding ground for radicalism.
   It became visible when Moslem extremists tried to overthrow the
government of Trinidad.
   ``Trinidad was a ticking time bomb, but it is only one of a
number of such situations in the Caribbean,'' said Larry Birns,
director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington.
   Economic decay throughout the region provides fertile ground for
civil unrest, analysts say.
   ``Economic prosperity solves a broad range of societal problems,
and economic despair breeds them,'' Birns said.
   Abu Bakr, leader of Jamaat-al-Muslimeen, said he and his
followers seized Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson and 54 other
hostages on July 27 because of the poverty that has replaced
Trinidad's oil bonanza of the 1970s.
   Most of the Caribbean's two dozen islands have similar problems
because of shrinking world markets for bauxite, oil, bananas, sugar
and other traditional exports.
   Unemployment in the region averages 22 percent, foreign debt in
the billions drains tax revenues, inflation erodes buying power and
living standards fall.
   Foreign investment, trade agreements like the Reagan
administration's Caribbean Basin Initiative and expansion of
tourism have not stopped the decline.
   ``Unfortunately, the United States thinks in terms of hundreds
of thousands of dollars to solve Caribbean problems when it's going
to take hundreds of millions of dollars,'' said Birns, whose
organization often criticizes U.S. policy in the region.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam, demanded
Robinson's resignation and blamed him for the country's economic
plight. Most of Bakr's support came from poor blacks.
   Robinson won a landslide election victory in 1986, but Birns
said the prime minister had become a ``political pariah,'' largely
because of austerity measures dictated by the International
Monetary Fund as a condition for new loans.
   Consumer price increases, layoffs and reduced spending on
schools and hospitals demanded by the IMF have provoked riots in
Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Guyana, as well as several
Latin American countries.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi stepped into this picture,
analysts say, with handouts for Bakr and radical political parties
with potential to destabilize governments.
   ``It's a well-known fact that Libya has funded leftist
activities in Dominica, Antigua and St. Lucia and separatists
organizations in Martinique and Guadeloupe,'' said John Collins,
Caribbean advisor to the Puerto Rican government.
   ``The left-of-center parties in these small islands use support
from Gadhafi to exploit the economic underdevelopment which exists
in their countries to mount opposition to the right-of-center
parties that are pro-U.S.''
   The six-day hostage siege in Trinidad, which prompted widespread
looting and claimed at least 38 lives, has prompted Caribbean
leaders to review regional security measures.
   ``Our determination that this must not happen again must be
given explicit effect,'' Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford of
Barbados said at last week's annual meeting of the 13-member
Caribbean Economic Community, or Caricom, in Kingston, Jamaica.
   Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica said a regional
security agreement dating to the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada
should be expanded to allow Caricom armies to intervene when an
elected government is threatened.
   In Trinidad's case, Caricom sent a multinational force of 150 on
Friday, two days after the siege ended, to aid the army and police.
   Guyana's independent Stabroek News said in an editorial that the
attempted coup was ``an affront to the aspiration of the region's
people.''
   ``We know the shock waves have reverberated throughout the
Caribbean, where many governments face a difficult economic
situation, and we imagine this will spur them all to greater and
more purposeful efforts to define a democratic future for Caribbean
peoples,'' it said.
   Anthony Maingot, a native of Trinidad who teaches sociology at
Florida International University in Miami, acknowledged the
region's vulnerability, but said democracy was firmly entrenced.
   ``This is the largest gathering of Third World democracies in
the world,'' Maingot said.
   He noted that in Trinidad Prime Minister Robinson ``is still
there, the elected government is still there and parliamentary
democracy is still intact. This is the silver lining of the cloud.''
