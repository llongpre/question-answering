  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 12 Jan, CANA -- The 
Trinidad and Tobago Government will issue new passports from the 
beginning of next month to combat passport fraud. 
  "In 1993 alone, over 300 cases of passport fraud came to our 
attention and for the first ten days of 1994, 18 cases have been 
reported, " Chief Immigration Officer Arthur Harper told 
reporters on Wednesday. 
  Harper said passports were being stolen to get the United 
States visas which were then inserted into a fradulent passport 
and sold to members of the public for as high as 10,000 Trinidad 
and Tobago dollars (one TT dollar - 17.5 US cents). 
  The Immigration chief said the passports which were being 
printed by a firm in the United Kingdom, had a number of 
built-in security features and were virtually tamper-proof. 
  Persons over 16 years old who have never owned a passport or 
whose passport has expired will have to pay 150 dollars while 
persons under 16 years would have to pay 75 dollars. 
  The holders of unexpired passports who are over 16 years 
will be required to pay 100 dollars for the new passport and 
persons under 16 years will pay 50 dollars. 
  Harper said all passports issued before Immigration started 
handing out the new ones will be declared null and void on June 
30, 1995.
