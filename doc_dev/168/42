  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 7 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad and 
Tobago's former national security minister, John Donaldson, has 
been appointed non-resident ambassador to Korea. 
  Foreign Affairs Minister Ralph Maraj said Donaldson will be 
based in Port of Spain, as economic constraints have forced 
government to increase the number of non-resident ambassadors 
where diplomatic postings in faraway countries were concerned. 
  "I'm optimistic that being able to be in closer contact with 
the cabinet and the government, a non-resident ambassador will 
be better positioned to deepen relations ... And will prove more 
productive than what existed before," he said. The minister also 
said that a delegation of Korean businessmen was expected in 
Trinidad for a trade fair in April.
