   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem extremists who stormed
into Parliament firing automatic weapons held the prime minister
and other officials hostage Saturday. Trinidad's archbishop said
the rebels had wired the captives with explosives.
   The rebels said they had overthrown the government in the attack
Friday afternoon, but Education Minister Clive Pantin said Saturday
that the government had not fallen and was in control of the
situation.
   The Red Cross said several people were wounded, and a news
report said three people were killed.
   After bursting into the Parliament building Friday afternoon,
the rebels from the Black Moslem group took Prime Minister Arthur
N. Robinson and members of his Cabinet hostage. Some captives were
apparently being held in the Parliament building called Red House
and others in a TV station.
   Archbishop Anthony Pantin said on government radio he talked to
coup leader Abu Bakr for 25 minutes Saturday afternoon. He said
Bakr told him the TV building was surrounded by men with guns and
he would detonate the captives and himself if an attack was
launched.
   ``He has informed me that the prime minister and other
parliamentarians in the Red House are wired up with explosives,''
Pantin said.
   Police superintendent Leonard Taylor imposed a curfew until 1
p.m. Sunday. Acting President Joseph Emmanuel Carter declared a
state of emergency Saturday morning and put the country's
5,000-member army and 1,500-member police on alert. Carter was
serving as president while President Noor Hassanali was in London.
