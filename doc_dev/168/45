<P>
An end to Trinidad's hostage crisis drew tantalizingly close Monday, but 
negotiations collapsed at the 11th hour as renewed gunfire was heard at the 
Parliament building, where the prime minister of this twin-island nation and 
about 45 other people are being held captive. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials had called an evening news conference to announce the 
imminent release of the hostages and freedom for their black Muslim captors, 
but as the conference began an embarrassed official declared: "We came here 
expecting to give you word of an agreement, but as of now we cannot." 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to square one," conceded Maj. Dave Williams, a spokesman for the 
Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force. 
</P>
<P>
As Williams spoke, there was a prolonged burst of gunfire from the vicinity of 
Red House, the Parliament building where wounded Prime Minister A. N. R. 
Robinson has been held by rebellious Muslims since Friday evening. Also being 
held are Cabinet ministers, members of Parliament and others. 
</P>
<P>
Later, some wire services reported that Robinson and the chief negotiator for 
the Muslim extremists said they had reached agreement to end the standoff. But 
Williams denied that an agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfight broke out after negotiations already had become snagged over a 
demand by rebels in Red House to take their loaded weapons with them into 
officially approved sanctuary at their nine-acre religious enclave in Mucurapo, 
north of Port of Spain, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
In a confused series of announcements, government spokesmen Monday first 
estimated the number of hostages at up to 100, then scaled the number back to 
60 to 80, and finally, late Monday, issued what they called a "firm figure" of 
41. 
</P>
<P>
The government's chief information officer, Gregory Shaw, said there are 25 
hostages in the television building and 16 at Red House. The Red House hostages 
number eight government ministers, including Robinson, six other members of 
Parliament, the former ambassador to London and a top civil servant. 
</P>
<P>
As for hostage takers, Williams said they are believed to number about 45 in 
Red House and 75 in the television complex, where a prolonged gun battle 
involving rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and automatic weapons erupted at 
mid-morning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The morning clash occurred when some of the hostage takers attempted to shoot 
their way out of the television annex building and were driven back inside by 
troops who have surrounded both hostage sites, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
He had no explanation of the renewed gunfire around Red House, which occurred 
shortly before the beginning of a 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew Monday night. But the 
occurrence of two armed clashes at a time when the government felt it was 
making progress in negotiations for the release of the hostages suggested a 
pessimistic outlook, at least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it remained uncertain whether negotiations with the rebels, which began 
Saturday, were still in progress Monday night. Government spokesman Shaw, said 
only that "up to this time (7 p.m. Monday local time), the government has not 
agreed to demands of the group that have been holding the prime minister and 
his colleagues and other persons at gunpoint since they burst into Parliament 
Friday evening." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw stressed several times that "intensive efforts are continuing to ensure 
the safety" of the hostages. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that Knolly Clarke, an Anglican clergyman who talked to Robinson 
by telephone Monday, reported that the prime minister told him he would be the 
last to leave Red House, only after all the other hostages were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also said Robinson had been shot in both feet but was reported in 
stable condition and under treatment by Dr. Emmanuel Hosein, the health 
minister and a fellow hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Although some pillaging of stores and shopping centers continued Monday, Port 
of Spain and its environs appeared calm. Officials clamped a 24-hour curfew on 
the capital's center, where the hostage sites are located, and a 6 p.m.-to-noon 
curfew on the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasts from the one radio station still operating stressed that "security 
personnel have shoot-on-sight instructions" for dealing with looters, who 
already have plundered an estimated $50 million worth of goods. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of casualties remained uncertain, but a local newspaper, the 
Express, said city hospitals reported 314 persons treated for injuries. A total 
of 169 required surgery, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams minimized casualties in the Defense Force, saying only that three 
soldiers had been hit, none seriously, by gunfire. He said he believed six of 
the hostage takers, all members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen black Muslim group, 
had been killed. Unofficial estimates of the number dead in Port of Spain ran 
as high as 100. 
</P>
<P>
The black Muslim group, long a focus of concern to the government because of 
what it perceived as the organization's tendency toward violence, is itself 
showing signs of schism, Shaw and Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams cited the attempted breakout at the television complex at a time when 
the Red House hostage takers appeared to be in agreement with the government as 
evidence of what he called "some degree of splintering in the ranks of the 
hostage takers." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the Red House group appeared to have broken ranks with the television 
group when they began demanding the right to keep their arms -- the demand that 
caused the hoped-for agreement to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, as outlined by the government spokesman, the television 
complex and Red House captors would be granted amnesty and be allowed to return 
in stages to their Islamic religious commune, itself a source of longstanding 
conflict with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the first step would be release of the television hostages, who 
would be taken to the Trinidadian army's Camp Ogden for physical and 
psychiatric examination. Their captors would then be freed to return unarmed to 
their commune. Next, the hostages in Red House would be released in the same 
fashion and their captors freed to go back to the Muslim enclave in Mucurapo. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the failed agreement included any conditions requiring the resignation 
of Robinson and appointment of an interim government including Muslim leader 
Yasin abu Bakr, the spokesmen said they were "not aware of any such condition 
being on the table." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a clear account of events from the government or local news 
outlets, rumors abounded. Among them was a report that a battalion of troops 
from the Jamaica Defense Force had been flown in from Kingston to assist local 
forces in policing the capital, as well as a rumor that some American troops 
had landed. 
</P>
<P>
Both were denied by Col. Ralph Brown, commander of the Trinidad and Tobago 
Defense Force. "We've got things under control, and we don't need any help," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader, Bakr, has been the center of controversy since 1985, when he 
founded the black Muslim group on the premise that "the nation was corrupt in 
the hands of evil men," said the Express newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Following a stint in jail for contempt of court, Bakr went to Libya and formed 
close ties to that country's radical leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi. Following his 
return to the islands, Bakr was arrested after a police raid uncovered an arms 
cache at the Muslim commune. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy flared again last year when the government charged that his 
group was occupying the commune illegally and sent a crew to demolish some 
buildings there. Last week, just three days before he led the hostage-taking 
raid on the television complex and Parliament building, Bakr lost a high-court 
test to claim rights to the land. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House and State Department spokesmen both emphasized that 
the estimated 6,000 American citizens in Trinidad and Tobago, most of them 
tourists, appeared to be in no immediate danger. However, the U.S. Embassy 
issued an advisory suggesting that Americans on the island remain indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Violence in the country appears to be restricted to the capital, White House 
Deputy Press Secretary Steve Hart noted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials refused to comment on reports that American naval vessels were in the 
vicinity of the islands, although the Navy routinely keeps several ships in a 
large naval training area nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials noted the ties between Libya and the group holding the 
hostages, but added that no evidence exists of Libyan involvement in the 
current attack.

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400,000 Muslims make the Caribbean their home. But most are East Indians 
who disdain the radical politics of black Muslims such as those holding 
Trinidad's government hostage. Many East Indians consider black Muslims to be 
political opportunists, inspired more by the black power movement than by 
traditional Islam. Stokely Carmichael, the black power advocate of the 1960s in 
the United States, was born in Trinidad. Prominent Muslims among the region's 
political leaders include President Noor Hassanali of Trinidad and Prime 
Minister Hamilton Green of Guyana. The first Muslims came to the region to work 
in the sugar cane fields in the 1700s. Now, domed mosques can be found on a 
dozen Caribbean islands.
