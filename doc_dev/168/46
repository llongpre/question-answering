   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A Houston couple who decided to
celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary with their first foreign
vacation haven't gotten the romantic island getaway they planned.
   ``I feel like I've been a hostage here,'' grumbled Melvin Hazel
on Monday.
   ``We're eating a good meal and no one's pointing any guns at
me,'' said his wife, Darlene, confiding: ``I have a lot of sense of
adventure.''
   They're among some two dozen Americans still stranded on this
Caribbean island where Moslem extremists stormed Parliament and the
state television building on Friday, seizing the prime minister and
other officials.
   Some of the Americans have since left the island on one of a few
packed flights by regional carriers. But most have been unable to
leave.
   ``Doesn't the American government have any responsibility for
us? They've shown no intention of helping us,'' said Nancy Schnair,
here with husband Howard Schnair of Chicago on a planned combined
business-vacation trip.
   Lucy Hall, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, said American visitors to
the island were being contacted and assured their government was
concerned about them.
   ``We can't help them because we don't run any airlines,'' Ms.
Hall said of American requests for help getting off Trinidad. She
said some 2,100 U.S. citizens, the great majority of them
residents, are on the islands.
   ``I just want to be somewhere else,'' said Chris Bigalkie, here
on business as regional vice president of Drew Industrial Division.
``We don't have anything like this in Memphis (Tenn., his
hometown).''
   The Schnairs, another couple on a combined business-pleasure
trip _ Martin and Joyce Beckwith of Boston _ and the Hazels of
Houston spent much of Monday morning sitting on the airy veranda of
the Hilton Hotel overlooking this capital city.
   They heard the volleys of gunfire and explosions and saw fire
erupt from the state television complex, where rebels were holding
hostages.
   Hazel, who works in construction, said he and his wife, with
three children in their 20s, wanted to celebrate their 30th
anniversary in style. They had once met some Trinidadians who sang
the praises of their island, and they thought this would be the
perfect place for a long-delayed second honeymoon.
   They arrived Thursday and spent Friday sightseeing. But when
their taxi driver returned Friday evening to take them to dinner at
a seafood restaurant as they requested, he advised them not to go
downtown because of the violence.
   They scrubbed plans to visit sister island Tobago, and now are
only anxious to go home.
   ``They really messed it up for us,'' said Mrs. Hazel.
