  [Text]Nation Security Minister Russell Huggins has 
estimated the annual value of the illegal drug trade at "well 
over one billion dollars." 
  Huggins was speaking at a news conference in the Parliament 
Committee Room yesterday just prior to yesterday's sitting of 
the Senate. The media conference was called to answer 
journalists' queries arising from the Bill to amend the 
Dangerous Drugs Act. 
  Huggins said the proposed amendments would allow Trinidad 
and 
Tobago to ratify the Vienna Convention. This, he added, would 
give this country greater access to funding for the fight 
against the drug trade from donor countries such as the United 
States, the Netherlands, Germany and France. 
  He said the passage of this legislation signals to the 
international community that "we are serious." 
  Huggins said one of the more important features of the Bill 
was its provisions relating to money-laundering, which, he said, 
could destroy the financial system of a country. 
  "One has to understand dealings in drugs take place in cash. 
So you have a lot of cash to clean. Cash can be cleaned by 
buying a boat from someone for $90,000. You pay in cash and then 
you sell it back for $80,000. You are prepared to take the 
$10,000 loss because you now have $80,000 certified (clean) 
money." 
  He cited the U.S. as an example of a case where there has 
been a proliferation of jewelry stores and "when you go down 
inside them they don't have a piece of jewelry; they are simply 
being used as fronts." 
  He said that in Trinidad and Tobago drug lords had used the 
importation of potatoes as a laundering device. 
  He said laundering could occur in any establishment: "Where 
you had the import of used cars, that is another method of doing 
it. 
  You bring down cars and you pay more for them and sell them 
for less. That is one of the ways in which it is done. Another 
way is to buy up postal orders every month." 
  Huggins said one of the biggest busts in the U.S., "US $6 
billion in cash," had been organised in this way. "A massive 
laundering operation which took four years to bust and with all 
the resources they have. 
  I mention this simply to let you know that you shouldn't 
look for miracles from our people. We are trying to put a unit 
together and are having some hiccups with the Organised Crime 
and Narcotics Unit." 
  But he stressed that there were dedicated people working on 
it, adding that it took time to really bust a drug operation. 
"Time and a lot of ground work. A drug lord does not bring you 
into his trust overnight," he said. 
  "He said between November 1993 and this year, the Trinidad 
and Tobago authorities had participated in the seizure of 200 
kilos of cocaine shipped from Trinidad. The intelligence given 
for its seizure came from here," he said. 
  Stressing that in order to hurt the drug-trafficker one had 
to deal with money-laundering, Huggins pointed to some of the 
shortcomings of the original legislation, which, he said, did 
not go far enough. 
  Before now, he said, it was not an offence for a 
drug-trafficker to launder his own proceeds, though it was an 
offence for someone to help him. 
  Huggins said the proposed legislation, apart from addressing 
this, would also limit the number of places where the 
drug-trafficker could hide his assets because the Bill allowed 
for the recognition and enforcement. 
  The Bill was passed unanimously at 9:45 p.m.
