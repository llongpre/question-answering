   Most of the arsenal used in a failed coup attempt
in Trinidad by Moslem extremists was purchased at gun shows and
shops throughout South Florida, says a complaint against the
alleged chief supplier.
   Louis Haneef of Pompano Beach was arrested early Thursday during
a raid on his home, said federal agents.
   The federal complaint against Haneef also includes a warrant for
the leader of the revolt, Yasin Abu Bakr, a former Trinidad
policeman who took the island nation's prime minister prisoner for
six days in July before surrendering.
   Of the 135 weapons confiscated in Trinidad after the revolt
collapsed, 105 were traced to purchases made in Florida by Haneef,
said Joe Vince, assistant special agent in charge of the Miami
office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   ``He was supplying the weapons that were used in the
insurrection - there is no question about it,'' the agent said.
   The arrest shows the United States will not tolerate gun
smuggling, said Miami's U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   ``We are no longer going to allow South Florida to be used as a
Mecca for people to purchase weapons to be used for narcotics
traffickers ... or people planning rebellions anywhere in the
Caribbean or in the Americas,'' Lehtinen said.
   Haneef bought at least 200 assault rifles and other firearms and
the ATF is seeking the missing guns, said Vince. He also purchased
250,000 rounds of ammunition, along with electronic equipment that
included hand-held radios.
   One key question was where Haneef obtained the approximately
$100,000 in $100 bills he used to buy the weapons in Dade and
Broward county gun shows and weapons shops, Vince said.
   Trinidad officials said Bakr and many of his men had visited
Libya and received training and money there, although they have
found no evidence Moammar Gadhafi was behind the coup attempt.
   Haneef's money was drawn on a bank in the Persian Gulf nation of
Bahrain, but its original source was still part of the
investigation, he said.
   The federal complaint, along with Haneef and Bakr, names Billaal
Abdullah, another leader of the revolt, and Riad Ali, both of whom
are also imprisoned in Trinidad.
   Haneef was originally from St. Louis, and changed his name from
Louis Cole when he became a Moslem, Vince said. He added that the
complaint would eventually be presented to a grand jury for
indictments.
   The men are accused of gun control and arms export violations,
said Vince.
   The investigation began in October 1989 when a Miami police
officer became suspicious of large gun purchases Haneef made at a
weapons show, according to an affidavit by ATF agent Thomas Bailey.
   Haneef was interviewed and said the weapons were for a gun club,
but the agency began surveillance. He ultimately bought about 200
weapons, including AK-47 and Ruger Mini-14 assault rifles,
shotguns, M-1 carbines and large-caliber pistols.
   The weapons and ammunition were allegedly smuggled out of the
United States in April aboard a freighter, hidden in hollowed-out
wall boards, Vince said. He said investigators had obtained a
warrant in hopes of placing an electronic tracer on the shipment,
but it had left port before they got there.
   The rebellion in Trinidad broke out in July when Bakr's forces
seized the Parliament House and state television, holding hostages
including Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson and other government
leaders.
   They demanded Robinson's resignation, new elections and amnesty,
but eventually surrendered on the sixth day of the crisis. Bakr and
other revolt leaders are now in jail facing treason, murder and
other charges.
   Vince said he did not expect Bakr to be extradited to Miami, but
said the warrants would remain in force in any case.
