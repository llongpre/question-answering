<F P=106> [Article by Wesley Gibbings: "Dollar Laundering Law Coming, </F>
Says Huggins"] 
  [Text] Government is considering the introduction of 
banking regulations which will make deposit declarations for 
large sums of money mandatory. 
  National Security Minister Russel Huggins made the 
revelation 
yesterday, saying the measure would be one instrument in the 
campaign against money laundering. 
  The matter arose while Huggins steered a motion on the 
granting of diplomatic immunity to the Caribbean Financial 
Action Task Force through the Senate. 
  Huggins was responding to a query from Opposition Senator 
Wade Mark who said commercial banks should not be left on their 
own to monitor a situation that provided vital clues to the 
scale of money laundering activities in the country. 
  "Don't leave it up to commercial banks," Mark said. "One 
important area of money laundering is the commercial banking 
sector." 
  Mark described the current arrangement as a "gentleman's 
agreement." Bankers have however reported some success with the 
system and a number of depositors, according to banking sources, 
have reportedly been turned away as a result. Huggins said 
regulations would be taken to Parliament on the matter "soon." 
  He also defended the country's invitation to the Task Force 
to set up office here, saying it offered a range of resources to 
enable this country to battle money laundering more effectively. 
  He told Senators that the body was not a policing agency and 
that it was established to offer technical advice and expertise 
to counter the incidence of money laundering in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. 
  Independent Senator Martin Daly expressed scepticism about 
the institution and said a trial period of two years should be 
built into the motion granting it diplomatic immunities and 
privileges. He however refused to pursue the amendment when the 
vote was taken. 
  Huggins also addressed fears by Mark that the industrial 
relations climate of certain regional institutions left much to 
be desired. 
  The Opposition Senator contended that the managers of some 
institutions often hid under the cover of diplomatic immunity in 
order to commit serious breaches of the constitutional rights of 
workers. 
  Huggins however said the terms of such diplomatic 
arrangements were dictated by international conventions and 
practices. The motion was passed unanimously. Last Friday, it 
gained similar consent from the Lower House.
