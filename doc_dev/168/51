   The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago on
Tuesday sought better U.S. intelligence communication following an
attempted coup he contends could have been prevented by
U.S.-supplied information.
   ``If we had the information that was in possession of certain
American authorities then we would have been able to prevent this
taking place,'' Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson said in
reference to the July 27 uprising on his Caribbean island in which
he was taken hostage.
   However, he insisted that he was not saying the United States
purposely withheld information.
   ``It was not an accusation,'' he said.
   He said ``certain authorities'' in Florida had information about
one of the coup leaders procuring arms in Florida for the coup
attempt.
   Robinson previously made similar statements.
   He told reporters at the White House that in his meeting with
Bush they ``talked generally about collaboration and exchange of
information ... in the field of containing attempts to disrupt
regimes in the region.''
   ``Certainly in the future we'll be seeking to be sure that
there's closer collaboration so there is an easier and freer
exchange of information,'' he said.
   Administration officials deny they had any knowledge of arms
being procured in Florida for the purpose of an overthrow in
Trinidad and Tobago.
   ``If we had we would have tried to alert them and stop it,'' one
White House official said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
congratulated Robinson and his government ``for the bravery shown
in confronting the terrorists and in defending their democratic
institutions.''
   Bush also ``commended the prime minister for his market-oriented
economic policies, his commitment to the war on drugs and for his
strong statement of support for U.N. measures against Iraqi
aggression,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the recent extension of the Caribbean Basin Initiative
was ``a sign of our firm commitment to the economic well-being of
the Caribbean, and we are confident that the Enterprise for the
Americas initiative will support Caribbean integration.''
   In the coup, Moslem militants stormed Parliament and the
government-run TV station and took Robinson hostage with about 50
other officials. The coup was suppressed after six days, during
which 24 people were killed.
   The government has declared a state of emergency and cancelled
elections scheduled for Oct. 15. No new date has been set, Robinson
said.
   The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms in Miami arrested
Louis Haneef of Pompano Beach, Fla., on charges of supplying
weapons to the coup leaders. A spokesman has said the bureau did
not know of his connection to the oup until after it occurred.
   Robinson was in Washington on his way home from the United
Nations General Assembly session in New York.
