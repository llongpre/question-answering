   The Caribbean tourism industry
watched developments in Trinidad carefully this week, aware that
violence on one island can hurt business throughout the region.
   ``I hope they get this resolved quickly. The longer it goes on,
the worse it will look to the traveling public,'' said Clive
Banfield, Delta Air Lines marketing manager.
   The Caribbean Tourism Organization has sent telegrams to travel
agencies saying other Caribbean countries were safe.
   Barbara LeBlanc, a writer for the daily San Juan Star newspaper,
observed that even the hint of danger drives away tourists looking
for a ``fantasy'' island.
   ``The international tourist's knowledge of democracy is awfully
small. There is very little doubt that problems like this hurt the
region,'' said John Bell, executive vice president of the Caribbean
Hotel Association.
   Bell said it was fortunate the Moslem uprising and looting in
Trinidad happened during the summer slow period. The prime winter
season is five months away.
   Hotelier Jag Mehta, manager of San Juan's Radisson Normandie
Hotel, said Puerto Rico will escape the fallout from the negative
publicity and could benefit from tourists looking for safer places
to visit.
   ``It's too far from us. Fortunately, The New York Times and
other newspapers showed maps. So people know where the problem
was,'' he said.
   Airports were closed Friday evening on the twin islands of
Trinidad and Tobago and did not re-open until Sunday, and then only
during daylight hours. Some airlines canceled flights to the
islands until conditions returned to normal.
   Trinidad's 22-hour curfew, 6 p.m. to 12 noon daily, tied up
traffic between the Piarco international airport and Tobago's Crown
Point airport, said Noel Sweeney, director of the Trinidad and
Tobago Tourism Development Authority.
   Interviewed by telephone, Sweeney said a flight was leaving
Wednesday with about 100 tourists who were stranded on Tobago after
their vacations ended.
   Dallas Vonortengren of Kawana Travel in New York said the
disruptions in flight schedules made it difficult to get tourists
out of the area.
   ``The situation is much too unstable to advise travelers to go
there,'' she said.
   The violence is likely to set back Trinidad and Tobago's efforts
to develop tourism, particularly on the island of Tobago.
   The country's economy, dominated by the oil industry, is in a
slump because of low world oil prices. The government has earmarked
increased tourism as one new source of employment and foreign
exchange earnings.
   Sweeney said 218,000 people visited Trinidad and Tobago in 1989,
including about 29,000 cruise ship visitors.
   The major tourist attraction in Trinidad is the annual Carnival,
which the Caribbean Islands Handbook says some consider ``safer,
more welcoming to visitors and artistically more stimulating than
its nearest rival in Rio de Janeiro.''
   Neighboring Tobago has a world famous reef, Buccoo Reef, known
for its spectacular fish, diving and clear warm waters.
