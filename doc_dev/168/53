</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The five-day hostage crisis that devastated the capital city of Trinidad and 
Tobago ended Wednesday with the surrender of 112 black Muslim rebels who were 
holding 46 captives in two besieged downtown buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Minister of Planning Winston Dookeran, who led the government's negotiating 
team, said the hostage takers surrendered unconditionally and are being 
detained under heavy guard at the Teteron army barracks, 10 miles west of Port 
of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the government had deceived the rebels into believing they would 
be pardoned and released, Dookeran evaded a direct answer and simply repeated 
his assertion that the capitulation was unconditional. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Gregory Shaw had earlier suggested that the rebels could 
face charges of treason and murder for crimes that included the bombing deaths 
of at least two policemen. But Dookeran, who was himself a hostage for the 
first day of the five-day ordeal, would go no further than to say that 
"appropriate charges will be laid after an investigation." 
</P>
<P>
"The government condemns this abhorrent crime," Dookeran said at a press 
conference late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dookeran announced that Parliamentary Secretary Leo Divine died of gunshot 
wounds to the leg, received during the violent takeover of the Parliament 
building. 
</P>
<P>
He added that ailing Prime Minister Arthur N. R. Robinson, who was released by 
the rebels on humanitarian grounds Tuesday, was hospitalized in good condition 
and "there is no intention for him to resign." 
</P>
<P>
But some rebels of the group known as Jaamat al Muslimeen insisted that the 
government had promised them amnesty and that they were to be allowed to return 
to their controversial religious commune just north of Port of Spain. They said 
part of their supposed deal included Robinson's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, a number of whom appeared to be of East Indian descent, looked more 
like prisoners than pardoned men as they filed out at gunpoint, one at a time 
through a drenching tropical rain, to tightly guarded buses outside the 
Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) building, where 29 of the hostages had 
been held. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the attempted coup that led to the hostage taking, Yasin abu 
Bakr, was spread-eagled against the wall of a building near the TTT 
headquarters and searched before being prodded toward a bus. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakr, clad all in white and with hands clasped atop his head in surrender, 
smiled broadly and called "Allah is the greatest" to journalists. Earlier, he 
had walked out of the television building, placed his rifle in the street and 
then stood at attention as his followers came out singly at two-minute 
intervals, holding weapons over their heads. He submitted to a search only 
after all his followers had been searched first, face down on the concrete or 
up against a wall, and then loaded aboard the buses. 
</P>
<P>
A few hostage takers spoke to reporters from the windows of the buses that took 
them away, with one crying out, "We succeeded in our goal of exposing the 
corruption of this island." Several insisted that the government had promised 
to abide by an agreement to grant them full pardons, let them return to their 
homes at a Black Muslim enclave north of the capital and call elections in the 
near future to form a new government. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours later, as darkness settled over the no-man's land around Red House, 
the Parliament building where 17 top government officials had been held, the 
hostages there filed out singly, applauding with relief. 
</P>
<P>
Several, including Minister of National Security Selwyn Richardson, limped out 
of the Parliament building to a waiting panel truck. Richardson and Robinson 
had suffered gunshot wounds to the leg during the violent takeover last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although most hostages and all but three hostage takers appeared unhurt, there 
was no official word on their medical condition. The hostages were taken to the 
army's Camp Ogden for physical and psychological examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what development had led to the breakthrough Wednesday that ended the 
crisis, government spokesman Shaw replied, "I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said, "As far as the government is concerned, (the surrender) is 
unconditional. The hostage situation is over." 
</P>
<P>
As to what would now happen to the rebels, he said, "I know nothing about what 
their prospects or their future will be like." But he added that "they could be 
charged with treason and murder." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw insisted that the government had "made no agreement" with the rebels. 
During the past three days, there had been authoritative reports that an 
agreement detailing a staged release, as was finally achieved, had been at the 
heart of hostage negotiations and tentatively accepted by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Trinidadians interviewed during the hostage release expressed shock 
when they heard rebel claims that they had been promised amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
"Any agreement made under that kind of duress will not stand up legally and 
must not be honored," said Bonny Patrick, a Port of Spain businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis began at 6:10 p.m. last Friday when the rebels drove an 
explosives-laden car into the enclosure of the country's central police 
station. The station was demolished and the policemen died when the car bomb 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Almost simultaneously, two groups of rebels assaulted the Parliament and 
television buildings, trapping the government officials, including the prime 
minister, employees of TTT and others. A handful of the captives in Red House 
were allowed to go free during the early hours of the siege. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the hostage takers began early Saturday and were carried out 
mostly through the mediation of an Anglican clergyman, Rev. Knolly Clarke.
