  [Text] Action by alert employees at the Carib 
Brewery in Champs Fleurs on Friday assisted the Customs 
Department in making its largest marijuana haul for the year, 
and has opened up leads to a possible transhipment operation 
involving containers ferried between Miami and Jamaica. 
  The illicit cargo, more than 2,000 pounds of compressed 
marijuana with a street value of more than $TT6 million, was 
discovered when Carib employees involved in a loading operation 
came up against a camouflaged fibre-glass wall and secret 
compartment inside a 40-foot steel container. 
  The container, which came into Trinidad a week ago 
originally 
with goods from Jamaica for a Piarco entrepreneur, was one of 
several sent to the Carib plant from the Port-of-Spain docks by 
shipping agents to be loaded with products for Kingston. 
  Together with their management, the employees alerted the 
Customs officer who is always at their plant overseeing the 
export loading operations, and found the drugs when they pried 
the wall open. 
  The marijuana was nearly wrapped in some 250 plastic bags 
stacked inside a two-foot deep compartment behind the 
fibre-glass wall, which was painted and corrugated to make it 
appear identical to the regular steel wall at the back of the 
container. 
  They also found a Jamaica newspaper dated April 3 inside of 
the compartment. 
  Carib management was loud in their praise for the work and 
co-operation of the Customs officials, as well as the employees 
who made the discovery. 
  They had become suspicious when the container was filled 
although they had not yet hand-packed the number of cases that 
each such container is supposed to hold. 
  According to reports, one of the employees crawled along the 
two-foot space between the cases and the roof of the already 
filled 44-foot container to examine what the problem might be, 
and on tapping the rear wall found to his surprise that it was 
not steel but corrugated fibre glass. 
  The cases were then offloaded and the bags of marijuana 
found 
behind the fibre-glass wall. Preliminary investigations have 
revealed that the particular container was loaded in Jamaica and 
arrived in the country on April 23 from Miami with a cargo of 
goods consigned to the Piarco entrepreneur. 
  The goods were cleared on April 28 before the container was 
assigned to Carib by the shipping agents the following day. But 
the marijuana was not discovered until the loading operations at 
the brewery late Friday afternoon within an hour of the arrival 
of the container on the Carib compounds. 
  A team of Customs Preventive officers went to the plant to 
view the booty about three hours after it was discovered. They 
weighed it on the spot, packed it in two vans and despatched it 
to their warehouse in Port-of-Spain.

  A Customs spokesman said their investigations were 
continuing 
along "certain positive directions." He was not prepared to 
reveal any more, but the Narcotics Branch of the Police Service 
has also been brought into the picture. 
  In pursuit of information regarding the origin and 
destination of the illegal cargo, local authorities have 
contacted international investigative agencies, and the local 
Customs Department was receiving the fullest co-operation of 
their counterparts at U.S. Customs. 
  However, local shipping officials were saying yesterday it 
is 
unlikely that any marijuana trafficking occurred in any 
direction between Jamaica and Trinidad because police believe 
both countries produce the drug in vast amounts. 
  The shippers believe, therefore, that the marijuana was 
transported originally from Jamaica to Miami where it missed its 
pick-up because of some foul-up. The shipment then became loose 
cargo until its discovery at Carib, which ships about 50 
containers a week, mostly to Jamaica. 
<H5>  Tracing the Drug to Trinidad </H5>
  Container SCZU 3031795 arrived at the Port-of-Spain docks on 
April 23 on the vessel MV-Cari Sky. 
  The voyage originated in Miami, but that particular 
container 
was loaded at Kingston, Jamaica, and consigned to a Piarco 
entrepreneur. 
  The Piarco entrepreneur took delivery of the sealed 
container 
on April 28, having a transport contractor move it out of the 
Port-of-Spain docks. 
  The container was returned to the port the following 
morning, 
April 29, before 8 o'clock, apparently empty. 
  Later that morning, the container was delivered to another 
transport contractor and arrived at the Carib brewery at 1.12 pm. 
  The container was backed up to the loading dock for 
immediate 
packing of a cargo of Guiness destined for Jamaica. 
  By 2.30 pm, Carib loaders found that the container could not 
take the expected 1,600 cases. Their investigations revealed the 
false wall in the container and the Customs officer on the spot 
was summoned. They pried the wall open and found the marijuana 
stacked in a two-foot deep compartment, packed in plastic bags.
