   The season's first named storm,
Tropical Storm Arthur, swirled to life Tuesday in the Caribbean,
east of Trinidad.
   The government of the nation of Trinidad and Tobago issued storm
warnings for Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada and Grenada dependencies.
The islands separate the southeastern Caribbean Sea from the
Atlantic.
   At 2:30 p.m. EDT, Arthur's top sustained winds of 40 mph _ just
1 mph above the speed required for named-storm status _ were
centered near latitude 10.7 north and longitude 58.5 west, or about
160 miles east of Trinidad. It was moving west at about 20 mph and
was expected to continue that motion through the day, said Hal
Gerrish of the National Hurricane Center.
   Some additional strengthening was likely by mid-afternoon
Wednesday, Gerrish said. Three to 5 inches or rain and local
flash-flooding were expected to accompany the storm across the
islands.
   Tropical storms become hurricanes is their sustained winds top
74 mph.
   Arthur grew from a depression, the second of the 1990 season,
that formed Sunday in the open Atlantic. The Atlantic season runs
from June 1 to Nov. 30.
