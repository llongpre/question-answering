<F P=106> [Article: "3 Trinidadians in Grenada Charged with </F>
Drug-Trafficking"] 
  [Text] Three Trinidadians held in Carriacou last week 
with a large quantity of foreign exchange were released, 
re-arrested, and then charged with drug trafficking. 
  Shaffic Mohammed, Kishore Basdeo and Kenrick Ruyes were 
denied bail when they appeared before the Sauteurs Magistrate's 
Court in Grenada on Tuesday. 
  The trio had been detained by Carriacou police since 
February 
8, when their pirogue experienced engine troubles and had to be 
towed ashore. 
  Police said they discovered that the men were sailing in an 
unnamed speedboat, carrying unusually large amounts of cash, 
including some U.S.$153,000 and 10,000 British pounds sterling. 
  The men told the police they were on their way to St. Lucia, 
but they were kept in custody pending investigations into the 
origin of the cash. 
  During this time the Grenada police received a call from a 
Tunapuna businessman who claimed that the money on the boat was 
his, and that the correct sum was $164,500. 
  Grenada attorney Kenrick Radix who is representing the trio, 
said that he successfully challenged their detention by filing a 
habeas corpus application on their behalf on February 11. 
  However, the men were not released until February 14. 
  As soon as they were released, he said, they were arrested 
and charged with drug trafficking in Grenada, drug trafficking 
in St. Lucia and drug trafficking in Trinidad, and unlawful 
possession of U.S.$153,000 and 10,000 British pounds, being the 
proceeds of drug trafficking. 
  The cases were adjourned to February 22.
