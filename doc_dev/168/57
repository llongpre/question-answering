   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ The government announced it will
put soldiers on street patrol to help fight the drug-related
violence that has plagued this Caribbean nation for months.
   Justice and National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson said
late Friday that the move was to ``assist the police to curb the
spate of lawlessness with which the society is being afflicted.''
   He said the decision came in reaction to a Sept. 7 assassination
attempt against the wife of Trinidad President Noor Hassanaly and
the killing a month ago of Jeffrey Stollmeyer, a prominent
businessman.
   The president's wife, Zaylahar Hassanaly, was not injured when
gunmen peppered her limousine with automatic gunfire. The motive for
the attack was unknown.
   For several months Trinidad and Tobago, a country of 1.1 million
off the South American coast, has been suffered a wave of murders,
violent robberies and rapes.
   ``The present criminality definitely relates to the rise in the
availability of drugs,'' Richardson said in his remarks.
   He said the government of Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson has
decided on an ``anti-crime action plan to take effect immediately.''
   He said the plan includes 24-hour police and army street patrols,
an increase in coast guard patrols to intercept drug runners, and
the recruitment of 150 more police officers.
   During the past 12 months, the government has passed laws aimed
at confiscating property and money gained through drug trafficking
and limiting bail for people convicted of violent crimes.
