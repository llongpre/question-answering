AMOCO Trinidad Oil Co, a subsidiary of Amoco of the US, is to spend Dollars
300m (Pounds 167.5m) to exploit new gas wells and increase supplies to its
clients in the Caribbean state, Canute James reports from Kingston.
Amoco Trinidad will boost delivery to Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas
Company from the current level of 200m cu ft of natural gas per day to 350m
cu ft per day by 1996.
The new supply contract replaces an earlier agreement signed by Amoco and
NGC, and will expire in the year 2000. It is one of two contracts for gas
sale which Amoco has in Trinidad and Tobago. The other is to supply 80m cu
ft of natural gas daily to the Trinidad and Tobago Electric Commission until
1994.
Amoco Trinidad is the main producer of natural gas in that country,
accounting for 80 per cent of national production. It is also a major player
in Trinidad and Tobago's oil industry, producing an average of 72,000
barrels of crude a day.
Trinidad and Tobago has proven gas reserves of 10.3 trillion (million
million) cu ft. According to the government, extractable reserves amount to
about 7.6 trillion cu ft. Gas production in 1990, the latest year for which
figures are available, was 1.97bn cu ft, 7.7 per cent less than 1989.
