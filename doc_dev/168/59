  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 26 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad 
and Tobago has mobilised its army in the fight against crime on 
the street. 
  National Security Minister Russell Huggins said 300 armed 
soldiers have been placed on foot patrol in crime-hit areas 
throughout the country. 
  They are in the eastern part of Port of Spain, the southern 
San Fernando City and in some rural eastern and southern 
villages. 
  The issue of putting soldiers on foot patrol was mentioned 
in 
a statement to the nation last Friday by Prime Minister Patrick 
Manning, who expressed concern over the increase in serious 
crimes. 
  Last year, almost 20,000 serious crimes were reported to the 
police. There were 108 murders, including drug-related killings 
and the execution of key state witnesses. For this year, the 
country has so far witnessed 17 murders. 
  Following Manning's statement to the nation, Huggins met 
with 
Commissioner of Police Jules Bernard and chief of defence force, 
Brigadier Ralph Brown, over the weekend to work out a plan to 
have the soldiers on foot patrol. 
  Previously, soldiers had joined policemen in joint-patrols 
but this came to an end when there were no working vehicles to 
accommodate the special crime-fighting initiative. 
  Huggins said that like ordinary citizens, the soldiers were 
allowed to make citizen's arrest. 
  He also said that the soldiers' presence would act as a 
deterrent to criminal activites while bringing comfort to 
citizens. 
  "Having soldiers unaccompanied by the police is designed to 
bring comfort to the citizens," he said. 
  "It is not envisaged that bandits, seeing armed soldiers 
would say they don't have powers of arrest and decide to pull 
out their guns and commit robberies. 
  "The comfort aspect is just as important."
