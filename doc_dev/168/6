   Nearly 400,000 Moslems make the
Caribbean their home, but most are East Indians who disdain the
radical politics of black Moslems like those who are holding
Trinidad's government hostage.
   Saturday, black Moslem Abu Bakr took over Parliament and
threatened to kill the prime minister and much of his Cabinet.
   Bakr is a fundamentalist who has developed strong support from
Trinidad's poor black community. His Jamaat al-Muslimeen sect has
an eight-acre commune in western Port-of-Spain, where more than 250
men, women and children live. There is a large mosque, day care
center, school and kitchens for the homeless.
   Bakr has close ties with Libya and has often stated that Islamic
principles must dominate society.
   But few East Indian Moslems support views like Bakr's and
tensions between Moslems of East Indian and African descent _ two
groups that rarely mix _ have been high.
   Many East Indians consider the black Moslems political
opportunists inspired more by the black power movement than by
traditional Islam. Stokely Carmichael, the black power advocate of
the 1960s in the United States, was born in Trinidad.
   Among the region's political leaders, prominent Moslems include
East Indian President Noor Hassanali of Trinidad and Prime Minister
Hamilton Green of Guyana, a black who converted to Islam in the
1960s.
   The first Moslems came to the region to work in the sugar cane
fields, either as black slaves in the 1700s or as indentured
servants from India 100 years later.
   Now domed mosques can be found on a dozen Caribbean islands, but
the heaviest concentrations of Moslems are on the islands of
Trinidad and Tobago and in Guyana and Suriname on the South
American mainland.
   ``One of the region's strongest religious trends today is the
movement toward Islam among blacks,'' says freelance writer Larry
Luxner, who lives in San Juan. In the last 20 years, many blacks
have converted to Islam.
   Luxner, who has written extensively on Moslems in the Caribbean,
estimates that Trinidad-Tobago and Suriname each have 100,000
Moslems and Guyana 120,000.
   Trinidad and Tobago is mostly a Hindu and Christian nation of
1.3 million people. About 6 percent of the population is Moslem,
with those of East Indian and African descent each make up 40
percent of the Moslem population.
   Writing in the Arabic magazine Aramco World in 1987, Luxner said
Trinidad had 85 mosques, Guyana 133 and Suriname, formerly Dutch
Guyana, 150. He said 25 percent of Suriname's 400,000 people were
Moslem, the highest percentage in any country in the Western
Hemisphere.
   There are also 2,500 Moslems in Puerto Rico, most of them
Palestinians who arrived between 1958 and 1962, Luxner said.
