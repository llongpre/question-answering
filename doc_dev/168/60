   Political leaders of the 13 Caribbean
economic community members began a three-day meeting Tuesday,
saying their countries were in danger of being overwhelmed by
global changes.
   The speakers at the opening session also condemned the attempted
coup in Trinidad and Tobago, a member of Caricom.
   Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson, who
was released Tuesday after being held hostage by members of a Black
Muslim group for five days, was scheduled to attend the summit.
   His seat at the opening session was taken by Sahadeo Basdeo, the
country's foreign minister.
   ``Any criminal violation of democracy is repugnant,'' said
Barbados Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford. ``It must not happen
again, and we in Caricom must ensure that it does not.''
   The annual summit of Caricom began with calls by several leader
for further integration of economies to provide a basis for dealing
with the changes.
   Mexico answered the call by signing an agreement with the
Caricom to promote trade and increase economic cooperation in the
region, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gotari announced
Tuesday.
   Salinas de Gotari told the opening session of Caricom's annual
Heads of Government meeting that the agreement had been signed
between Caricom and Bancomext, the Mexican foreign trade bank.
   In addition to cooperation within the region, ``we are
determined to strengthen the role we play in the work of the
Caribbean Dvelopment Bank, and to identify new opportunities for
cooperation,'' the Mexican leader said.
   The Barbados-based Development Bank provides financial support
for the English-speaking Caribbean states. Mexico is a contributing
member of the institution.
   Caricom, which was created in 1973, aims at establishing a
regional common market by 1993.
   Its members are the English-speaking states of the Caribbean,
including Belize in Central America, the Bahamas, and Guyana in
South America. Mexico is not currently a member, and a Caricom
secretariat official said on condition he not be named that
Mexico's application for observer status would not be discussed
until next year's summit.
