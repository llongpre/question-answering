The health service of Trinidad and Tobago has sunk into a crisis so severe that 
nurses wrap newborns in brown packing paper and hospital patients complain 
about cockroaches in their beds. 
</P>
<P>
The health crisis is part of a general malaise whose symptoms include high 
unemployment, a sharply reduced standard of living and a steady drain of 
skilled citizens who seek a better life abroad. 
</P>
<P>
After months of quiet complaints about steadily deteriorating conditions in the 
country's state-run hospitals, hundreds of nurses took to the streets in 
demonstrations that left no doubt that Trinidad and Tobago is going though 
tough times. 
</P>
<P>
Only a decade ago, the twin-island republic of 1.3 million people was the 
affluent jewel of the West Indies, with a per-capita income higher than that of 
any other island in the Caribbean chain. 
</P>
<P>
The nurses' grievances range from poor pay to the absence of even the most 
basic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
As street protests gathered momentum in June, medical staff of one of the 
country's biggest hospitals, in the city of San Fernando, ran out of baby 
blankets and started wrapping newborn infants in brown packing paper. 
</P>
<P>
Patients at another hospital, at Point Fortin, told reporters that cockroaches 
and ants were routinely marching across their beds. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, hospital staff told of surgery by flashlight, urine-soaked 
mattresses, patients being asked to bring their own sheets and provide their 
own medicines. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no syringes. There are not enough beds, there are no bedpans, few 
wheelchairs and not enough hospital trolleys," said Dr. Kenrick Rennie, head of 
the Public Services Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to imagine for people in the industrialized world but some of 
our hospitals don't even have gauze." 
</P>
<P>
At the height of street protests in the capital, hundreds of nurses converged 
on the "Red House," the ornate Parliament building in Port of Spain, waving 
placards and chanting slogans demanding the immediate resignation of health 
minister Emanuel Hosein. 
</P>
<P>
In San Fernando, workers from other trade unions joined the nurses, represented 
by the PSA, in one of Trinidad and Tobago's biggest anti-government 
demonstrations in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Hosein promised action to tackle the crisis and blamed the problems of the 
health sector on the previous government that had run Trinidad and Tobago 
during the oil bonanza that turned the country into the richest in the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came (to power), there was not a cent in the kitty," Hosein told 
Parliament as nurses outside demanded his removal. "We have the mandate but no 
money." 
</P>
<P>
The present government, led by Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson, won a landslide 
victory in 1986 elections, taking 33 out of 36 seats in the House of 
Representatives and ending 30 years of uninterrupted rule by the People's 
National Movement. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say many of the problems faced by Robinson, including the health 
crisis, are typical of countries whose economies depend chiefly on oil. 
</P>
<P>
The oil boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s brought wealth and economic 
growth rates of 7% a year to Trinidad and Tobago. But since the collapse of oil 
prices in 1982, the one-legged economy has been in deep trouble. Government 
figures put unemployment at 23% and gross domestic product plunged from $6,856 
per capita in 1982 to $3,043 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
To halt the decline, the Robinson Administration launched an ambitious program 
to lessen dependence on oil, attract foreign investors, and cut government 
spending in line with the standard prescriptions of the International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The government, Trinidad and Tobago's biggest employer, introduced a 10% 
across-the-board wage cut and a 15% value-added tax, which cuts sharply into 
personal incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Some 15,000 civil servants are being offered voluntary retirement under a 
rationalization program. So far, there have been few takers. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the austerity package has been mixed. There has been praise from 
free-market advocates in Trinidad and the United States, the twin-islands' 
biggest trade partner. There has been condemnation from the opposition and 
labor unions who say there are no signs of progress. 
</P>
<P>
The government disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect a return to economic growth this year for the first time since 
1983," said Bhoendradatt Tewarie, the minister of industry, enterprise and 
tourism. "We are hoping for 1% growth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is possible that we will have only 0.5." 
</P>
<P>
According to a Central Bank report issued early in July, real gross domestic 
product in the first quarter of 1990 was 0.6% below the 1989 figure.
