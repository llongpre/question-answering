   President Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela and five Caribbean leaders on Saturday agreed to
strengthen relations between Latin American and the Caribbean and
pool efforts to fight drug smuggling.
   The leaders also agreed to press for an international conference
on Third World debt relief.
   The summit on this Caribbean island wrapped up a four-day state
visit by Perez to Trinidad and Tobago.
   On Friday, the Venezuelan leader and Prime Minister A.N.R.
Robinson signed agreements on trade and cooperation in the event of
an oil spill in the waters of the two oil-producing neighbors.
   The two met Saturday for four hours with prime ministers Michael
Manley of Jamaica, Erskine Sandiford of Barbados, James Mitchell of
St. Vincent and President Desmond Hoyte of Guyana.
   Robinson said late Saturday that the leaders agreed to
coordinate anti-drug smuggling efforts, encourage other Latin
American and Caribbean nations to strengthen relations between the
two regions and hold an international debt conference.
   He gave no further details.
   The six leaders arrived early Saturday in Trinidad's sister
island of Tobago, home to 44,000 people.
   Manley, Perez and Robinson, leaders of three highly indebted
nations, are strong proponents of reducing the debt burden of
developing nations.
   The summit was proposed during a July meeting in Grenada of the
13 leaders of the Caribbean Community, known as Caricom.
   Venezuela, separated from Trinidad by the eight-mile Gulf of
Paria, has formally requested observer status with Caricom.
   Robinson called the summit a ``meeting of the minds between
Venezuela and Caricom.''
   ``There is a strong need to expedite the integration process,
not only within (the Caribbean), but also between Latin America and
the Caribbean,'' Robinson said.
   Friday's agreements included Venezuela's extension of a $3
million line of credit to Trinidad, which reduced by 25 percent
tariffs on 12 Venezuelan products.
