  [Text] Police in Grenada last weekend made their biggest 
ever cocaine bust. 
  Some 60 kilos of the illegal drug were seized on board the 
vessel, "Let Me Live" on Sunday inside Grenada's territorial 
waters. 
  The illegal drug has a street value of around 33.3 million 
E.C. dollars. 
  "Let Me Live" was on its way from neighbouring Trinidad and 
Tobago to Union Island which is one of the Grenadine Islands 
controlled by St. Vincent when it was intercepted by the Grenada 
Coast Guard. 
  It was brought to the Coast Guard base at True Blue where 
the 
search was carried out by a joint Police and Customs party. 
  After the drug discovery was made, the six occupants of the 
boat, five Vincentian nationals, and one Trinidadian were 
arrested and subsequently charged for drug possession. 
  The Vincentians are Ishmel Hal (51), Constantine Alexander 
(25), Winston Nanton (25), Clement McIntosh (22), and Lawrence 
Alexander (48), while the Trinidadian is Sylvan Liverpool (50). 
  With the exception of Liverpool, the other five are crew 
members of "Let Me Live." 
  Liverpool has been quoted as saying that he was taking a 
ride 
on the boat in order to meet another vessel in St. Vincent on 
which he is employed as a seaman. 
  When the six accused were brought before Magistrate Patricia 
Mark on Tuesday, she remanded them to Richmond Hill prisons 
until December 1. 
  Barrister-of-law Neil Noel has been retained to represent 
four of the accused--Hall, Nanton, McIntosh and Liverpool. 
  The two Alexander's who are close relatives will be 
represented by lawyer Anslem Clouden. 
  Authoritative sources told GRENADA TODAY that the six 
suspects were arrested due to a tip-off received by Customs 
Officials. 
  A source said that when the boat was intercepted by the 
Grenada Coast Guard the search party was directed straight to 
the section where the furniture was located and told to search 
there for the illegal drugs. 
  The cocaine was discovered hidden among a number of parcels 
of black pepper among the furniture. 
  Police suspect that the drugs were placed there in an effort 
to prevent snifferdogs from detecting them in case of a search. 
  There are reports that the cocaine was intended for a 
national of Union Island. 
  Another source told this newspaper that it appears that only 
two of the six suspects are really connected to the drugs. 
  He also said that there is a "definite link" between the 
cocaine discovered and five Trinidadians freed in a Magistrate's 
court on the island recently. 
  The source stressed that all of them belong to the same drug 
trafficking ring which operates out of Port-of-Spain. 
  Prior to Sunday's haul, the biggest ever discovery of 
cocaine 
on the island was in June 1991, when 45 kilos carrying a street 
value of 25 million E.C. dollars were seized by police at a 
hotel in the south of the island. 
  Nationals Diego Peters and Spencer Drakes of LaPotrie, St. 
Andrew's were arrested and charged for possession of the drugs.
