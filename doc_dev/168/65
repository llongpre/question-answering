   A weakening Tropical Storm Fran moved across the
island nation of Trinidad and Tobago today with maximum sustained
winds of 40 mph.
   The season's seventh tropical depression was heading west at
nearly 25 mph, said the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables.
   Fran was expected to dump up to 3 inches of rain on Trinidad,
whose government is recovering from an unsuccessful coup attempt
two weeks ago by radical Moslems.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Fran was centered over Trinidad. The island is
seven miles off Venezuela.
   The government of Trinidad and Tobago today issued a tropical
storm watch in place of a more urgent warning that had been posted
late Monday. A tropical storm watch was discontinued for Barbados,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines at 9 a.m.
   The storm had dissipated Sunday but regained strength Monday.
Forecasters said it was likely to degenerate into a tropical wave
as it entered the southeastern Caribbean.
   A tropical depression becomes a tropical storm once its top
sustained winds reach 39 mph. A hurricane has top winds of no less
than 74 mph.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
