<HEAD>General Strike in Trinidad Protests IMF Conditions for Debt Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of workers
throughout Trinidad struck on Monday to protest an economic
austerity program and wage cuts imposed to meet International
Monetary Fund requirements for debt relief.
   Oil fields, factories and schools shut down.
   The trade union movement called it a ``Day of Resistance'' to
protest the government's 10 percent cut in the salaries of 65,000
public workers, part of the belt-tightening measures brought on by
the conditions of an IMF standby loan agreement.
   ``The strike has affected us, but it is much better than going
the way of the riots in Venezuela,'' said one businessman, who spoke
on condition of not being identified.
   He was referring to the bloody riots that rocked Venezuela last
week after the government there imposed similar measures.
   No violence was reported in the English-speaking nation of
Trinidad and Tobago, a former British colony of 1.2 million people
and the southernmost of the Caribbean islands, lying seven miles off
Venezuela.
   National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson said 50 to 65
percent of the estimated 400,000 workers in the private and public
sectors showed up for work.
   President Errol McCleod of the Oilfields Workers Trade Union said
80 percent of the union members stayed off the job. He said the only
exception was at the refinery, ``where we did not want to interrupt
the complex operations there.''
   Workers also struck the country's major sugar factory.
   The turnout at government offices and several ministries was
reported at 50 percent, but at the post office and other key
operations, only a 2 to 3 percent turnout was reported.
   Throughout the country, schools closed as teachers and students
stayed home.
   In Port of Spain, plainclothes army personnel drove the buses.
There were no taxis as cab drivers honored the walkout. In San
Fernando, the second largest city, there was no transportation and
hardly any commercial activity.
   Workers earn a minimum wage of $500 a month. Midlevel
professionals make about $900 monthly. Inflation has averaged 10
percent a year, but Trinidadians complain most about taxes and about
high prices for many consumer items.
   Trinidad and Tobago's foreign debt runs to nearly $1.8 billion.
The government of Prime Minister H.N.R. Robinson received a $128
million standby loan from the IMF in January to be parceled out in
three payments, conditional on expenditures being cut in the public
sector and other measures.
   The country made nearly 75 percent of its payments on the
principal and interests in 1988, or about $350 million dollars to
creditors.
   Payments for 1989 have not come due yet.
   Robinson says commercial creditors would only reschedule the debt
repayments within the context of an IMF program.
   The country's economy has been hit by the world decline in oil
prices.
