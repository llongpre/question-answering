   Tropical Storm Fran gathered strength in the
western Atlantic Monday and was bearing down on Grenada and
Trinidad and Tobago, forecasters said.
   The season's seventh tropical depression had dissipated Sunday
but regained its shape and sped west at 25 mph with top sustained
winds of 40 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Fran's center was near 9.3 degrees north latitude
and 55.4, minutes west longitude, or about 400 miles east-southeast
of Trinidad. Tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph extended
175 miles from Fran's center.
   The government of Trinidad and Tobago, which weathered an
unsuccessful coup attempt by radical black Moslems two weeks ago,
issued a tropical storm warning for its territory as well as
Grenada and other nearby islands in the southeastern Caribbean.
   A tropical storm watch was in effect for several islands to the
north: Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, said hurricane
specialist Hal Gerrish.
   The storm was expected to keep to its path and strengthen
slightly Tuesday, Gerrish said, but its progress across the
Atlantic was expected to slow.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30th.
