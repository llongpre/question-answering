<HEAD>Caribbean Leader: Panama Should Solve Problems Without Outside
Interference</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ The 13-member Caribbean Community
says Panama has a right to solve its economic and political crises
without outside interference, Foreign Minister Sahadeo Basdeo said
today.
   ``(It would be) contradictory to the principles of the Caricom
states for them to dictate to Gen. Manuel (Antonio) Noreiga what he
should do in his native Panama,'' said Basdeo, chairman of
Caricom's foreign affairs committee.
   Noriega, head of Panama's Defense Force and the power behind
Panama's civilian government, was indicted in February on drug
trafficking charges in Florida and has been under intense pressure
from the United States to step down from power.
   Basdeo's comments echoed a statement by Caricom foreign
ministers in a weekend meeting in Trinidad and Tobago.
   ``The ministers discussed the recent developments in Panama and
reaffirmed the sovereign right of the Panamanian people to
determine their own destiny free from external pressures,'' the
ministers said in a statement.
   The one-paragraph statement was contained in a 10-page
communique on international relations issued Sunday after the
two-day meeting.
   The United States recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle as Panama's
leader. Delvalle was replaced as president in February one day
after he ordered Noriega to step down.
