   Tropical storm Arthur, the 1990 Atlantic hurricane
season's first storm to get a name, today pushed heavy rain across
the Windward Islands with winds gusting to 60 mph in the Caribbean
Sea.
   Government officials on the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago
issued storm warnings for Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada and Grenada
dependencies. The islands separate the southeastern Caribbean Sea
from the Atlantic.
   At noon EDT, Arthur was centered about 425 miles southeast of
Ponce, Puerto Rico. It was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph
and was expected to remain on that course through Friday, said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables.
   Grenada reported 55 mph wind gusts early this morning and heavy
rains were reported on Tobago and other islands in the area, Sheets
said. The weather service reported top winds of 60 mph over open
water.
   Tropical storms become hurricanes if their sustained winds top
74 mph.
   Arthur grew from a tropical depression, the second of the 1990
season, that formed Sunday in the open Atlantic. The hurricane
season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
