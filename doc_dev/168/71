FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trinidad fertiliser sector
prepares to resume growth - Depressed prices have tempered the industry's
buoyancy

DEPRESSED PRICES over the past nine months, caused mainly by increased
production in the Ukraine, have tempered the buoyancy of Trinidad and
Tobago's fertiliser industry. This has exacerbated a slowdown in growth of
the industry over the past three years following rapid expansion in
nitrogenous fertiliser output between 1980 and 1989.
The Caribbean republic remains one of the world's leading producers of
ammonia and urea - the leader since the break-up of the Soviet Union, claim
local officials. Senior representatives of the energy and natural resources
ministry say they are not greatly concerned at the sate of market as the
country has the capacity to take advantage of the rebound that they believe
is inevitable.
This, however, will depend on a quick and significant increase in production
capacity. Combined output of ammonia and urea last year was 2.4m tonnes,
while installed capacity is 2.5m tonnes.
The feedstock for the fertiliser plants is locally-produced natural gas, and
officials say any significant expansion in ammonia and urea output must
await an increase in gas recovery. This is expected from a major gas field
off Trinidad's south-east coast in which three state-owned companies and
Enron Oil and Gas of Texas are investing USDollars 250m over the next five
years to recover 150m cubic feet of gas a day.
'The development of Trinidad and Tobago's nitrogenous fertiliser industry
has been assisted significantly by the advantage of local supplies of
energy,' explains Mr Rupert Mends, the permanent secretary in the energy and
natural resources ministry. 'We are also favoured by relatively easy and
quick access to our major markets in the US and Europe.'
Ammonia and urea production in 1991 was 4.6 per cent more than in 1990,
indicating a significant slow-down after a five-fold expansion between 1981
and 1989. The Trinidad and Tobago central bank, in a recent report, suggests
that such rates of growth may not be repeated in the short term.
The bank says that in the first half of last year production of nitrogenous
fertilisers totalled 1.23m tonnes, marginally higher than in 1991. But it
reports that international ammonia markets have been depressed, and that
this has coincided with the end of the fertiliser application season in
North America and Europe, with reduced demand in these areas.
'In addition, the easy availability of the product from the Ukraine
contributed to oversupply on global markets and consequently to lower
prices,' the bank says.
It reports that Trinidad and Tobago's ammonia averaged USDollars 77 a tonne
(fob Caribbean) in the second quarter of last year, against Dollars 97 a
tonne in the second quarter of 1991. Urea prices fell Dollars 21 from
Dollars 155 per tonne in 1991.
Trinidad and Tobago's nitrogenous fertiliser industry was born 30 years ago
when WR Grace of New York established Fedchem, an ammonia plant with a rated
capacity of 250,000 tonnes a year.
Thirteen years later the US company and the Trinidad and Tobago government
created a joint venture, Tringen, to run a 400,000-tonnes-a-year ammonia
plant. The facility was expanded in 1988 and now has a rated capacity of
920,000 tonnes a year.
Following a corporate decision to divest itself of its holdings in
fertilisers, WR Grace has sold its operations in Trinidad and Tobago to
Norsk Hydro of Norway.
A third ammonia plant, Fertrin, a joint venture between Amoco Oil of the US
and the Trinidad and Tobago government, began production in 1981.
The sole urea producer, the wholly state-owned Trinidad and Tobago Urea
Company, has a capacity of 600,000 tonnes per year.
The government is seeking buyers for its 51 per cent holding in Fertrin and
for the urea company.
