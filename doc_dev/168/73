   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ An American tourist was killed
after throwing himself into the engine of a taxiing jetliner at
Piarco International Airport, police said.
   Airports Authority chairman Winston Suite said the bizarre death
Sunday night was an apparent suicide.
   Police said Daniel John O'Brien, 31, of Roselle, Ill., near
Chicago, scaled an airport wall in the nude, attacked four security
guards and stole their four-wheel-drive vehicle.
   He drove the jeep onto the tarmac to a British Airways 747 that
was readying for takeoff, smashing the vehicle's top. Guards said
O'Brien scrambled out the wreckage, smeared grease on his bleeding
shoulder, then ran back to the jetliner and threw himself into the
engine.
   O'Brien had been vacationing with a friend on Tobago, Trinidad's
sister island in the Caribbean, and was to fly home Monday.
   Other details were not immediately available.
