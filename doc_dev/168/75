FT  02 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Caribbean cross-border activity loses
its appeal - Economic worries are to blame

Economic difficulties in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have
dampened cross-border trading on the Caribbean's stock exchange after its
promising start last year.
Between May 1991, when cross-border trading began, and December of that
year, Jamaican investors were the most adventurous in taking risks on other
markets, by spending Dollars 5.4m on Trinidadian stocks and Dollars 1,600 on
Barbadian shares.
But Trinidadians spent only Dollars 2,000 on Jamaican stocks while buying
Dollars 4m worth in Barbados. For their part, Barbadians favoured Trinidad,
buying Dollars 5m worth of shares but steering clear of Jamaica.
Regional business leaders and stockbrokers were encouraged by this start.
This, they argued, was a new venture for the Caribbean and could, if
successful, strengthen the equity base of many companies which have been
overly dependent on loans for their operations and expansion plans.
Since the start of this year, however, hopes for a continued expansion of
cross-border trading have been dashed by a drop in confidence in the
national markets, brought on by economic difficulties. Between January and
September, Jamaican investors spent Dollars 466,000 on Trinidadian shares
while Trinidadians and Barbadians bought nothing.
'We started last year with a bang, with Jamaicans buying in Trinidadian
companies,' says Mr Anthony Taitt, deputy general manager of the Trinidad
and Tobago Stock Exchange. 'Since December, however, the market in Jamaica
has dried up and Jamaicans have been trying to sell off what they have
bought in Trinidad.'
Activity on the Caribbean exchange has been hit by economic changes in
Jamaica, where the government's deregulation of the foreign exchange market
14 months ago and the floating of the currency led to a steep depreciation
and contributed to inflation of 82 per cent in 1991.
Interest in Barbados has been dampened by problems which have beset what was
one of the more stable economies in the region. Stagnation, brought on by
poor performance of tourism and sugar, the pillars of the economy, deterred
prospective investors who were further worried by rumours of an impending
currency devaluation.
Trinidad and Tobago's oil-dependent economy had contracted for seven
consecutive years until it recorded marginal growth last year. But the
central bank has reported that this recovery has not been sustained.
'I am not disappointed in the level of activity in cross-border trading so
far as I did not anticipate any great volumes when we started,' says Mr Wain
Iton, the manager of the Jamaica Stock Exchange. 'The important thing is
that the mechanism for trading is in place and when the economic conditions
are right, they will be fully used.'
Cross-border trading is part of a wider effort by the members of the
Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) to integrate their economies and
prepare the ground for a planned common market and monetary union. The next
step is the creation of a Caribbean exchange linking the shares in the three
countries through an immediate electronic transfer of all transactions. The
exchange would be capitalised at about Dollars 1.8bn, with 99 listed
companies.
There is some hope that an economic recovery will breathe new life into
cross-border trading. The Jamaican dollar has stabilised since May and the
country's inflation is expected to fall to 20 per cent this year.
Officials also hope that the creation of new stock exchanges in Caricom will
attract interest. Guyana is creating an exchange which Mr Asgar Ally, the
country's finance minister, says will be similar to that in Jamaica and
Trinidad and Tobago, and which will assist in the privatisation of state
enterprises. Mr Ally says trading on the Guyana exchange will begin by the
middle of next year, and will immediately be part of the Caribbean
cross-border activity.
