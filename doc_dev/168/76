<F P=106> [Article: "Three British Visitors on Cocaine Charges"] </F>
  [Text] A teenager was among three British tourists who 
appeared before an Arima magistrate yesterday charged with 
possession of liquid cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and 
attempting to export the drug. 
  Steven Peterkin, 31, of Sand Rock Road, London; Sharon 
Mitchell, 27, of Batterson, London; and Nathalie Simmons, 18, of 
New Cross, London, were held by members of the Organised Crime 
and Narcotics Unit at Piarco Airport on Friday shortly before 
they boarded BWIA flight for London. 
  According to court prosecutor Sgt Paul Glodon, Peterkin had 
4.35 kilos of the drug in his luggage while Mitchell had 2.3 
kilos and Simmons 150 grammes of cocaine hidden in their luggage. 
  Peterkin pleaded guilty to the charge of attempting to 
export 
the drug while the other two accused pleaded not guilty. 
  Magistrate Trevor Peters, presiding in the Arima First 
Magistrate's Court, denied the three Londoners bail. They will 
re-appear on March 3.
