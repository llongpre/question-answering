Behind the Caribbean's sandy beaches, palm trees and fruity rum drinks is a 
festival waiting to happen. A festival, Caribbean style, is part street party, 
part masquerade and part jam session. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers to Trinidad know that a Caribbean festival is not a spectator sport. 
Unlike an American parade, where people line the sidewalks watching the bands 
march and majorettes twirl, audience participation is part and parcel of 
Caribbean festivals. When a Carnival band goes by, playing its infectious 
calypso or steel-band music, the audience jumps in and dances in the street 
with the music makers. 
</P>
<P>
"The music almost forces you to participate," said singer and poet Hollis 
(Flash) Lashley, a native of Trinidad who lives in Silver Spring, Md. "It's 
what our Caribbean culture is all about. The movement and music and color of a 
festival are an integral part of who we are and how we live." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Festivals Along 
</P>
<P>
These festivals have become such an important part of peoples' lives in the 
Caribbean that they don't leave home without them. Wherever West Indians settle 
in large numbers, their festivals are likely to follow. Brooklyn, Toronto, 
Baltimore, Boston and London have all been host to Caribbean festivals. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Smithsonian Institution is recognizing these annual events 
as an art and as the cultural expressions of the people of the Caribbean in a 
new exhibition, "Caribbean Festival Arts," continuing until Feb. 15, 1990. The 
exhibition, originally organized by the St. Louis Art Museum, is complemented 
by dozens of special events, including live performances of calypso and 
steel-band music, crafts and costume-making demonstrations, films and 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
"In presenting three festivals -- Junkanoo, Carnival and Hosay from Trinidad 
and Tobago -- we hope to give North American audiences a sense of the Caribbean 
culture," Vera Hyatt, the Smithsonian's project director for the exhibition, 
said. "The essence of this culture is a synthesis of many influences: African, 
English, French, Indian and Spanish. A kind of cross-fertilization took place 
in the islands of the West Indies and the result is a culture that is unique to 
the Caribbean." 
</P>
<P>
In the exhibit, as in a real-life festival, the dominant themes are music and 
masquerade. Music is at the heart of any festival, whether it is reggae in 
Jamaica or French songs in Haiti or steel bands in Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Influences 
</P>
<P>
Original Carnival music can be traced to European influences -- to minstrel 
bands and court music. The African sounds of drums were introduced in the 17th 
Century when millions of African slaves worked on the sugar-cane plantations 
dotting the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Calypso was introduced in the mid-1800s in Trinidad where slaves sang the 
call-and-response songs and humorous ditties of their African homelands. 
Today's soca, popular music combining calypso and American soul, began in 1975 
with the release of two recordings, "Sweet Music" and "Endless Vibration" by 
singer Lord Shorty. 
</P>
<P>
Reggae originated in the mid-1960s as a music of the Jamaican poor. The 
distinctive sound of reggae's loud electric bass with organ, piano and drums, 
was popularized in the United States in the early 1970s in the film "The Harder 
They Come," starring singer Jimmy Cliff, and through tours of Bob Marley and 
the Wailers. 
</P>
<P>
But the drum provides the pulse of all Caribbean music, and nowhere is that 
more obvious than in the steel band. The pan or steel drum tradition goes back 
to the drums of Africa. When the Trinidad government banned drums in 1883 on 
the grounds that they were loud and disruptive, the "tambour bamboo" bands 
played on, using bamboo cylinders similar to the African Shango drum ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Found' Instruments 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years later, bands were experimenting with an array of "found 
instruments" -- including kettles, salt boxes and paint cans -- to give louder, 
stronger sounds. 
</P>
<P>
On V-E Day, May 8, 1945, everything from trash cans to biscuit tins was fair 
game for the drummers rejoicing in the streets. One year later, a new device 
arrived on the Carnival scene -- the 55-gallon oil drum, used to ship 
Venezuelan oil to refineries in Trinidad, Aruba, Curacao and other Caribbean 
islands. The unique sound qualities of the oil drums and their availability 
made them immediately -- and lastingly -- popular. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some say that Carnival without pan would be like nature without color. 
Journalist Knolly Moses, a Trinidadian living in New York City, occasionally 
plays pan and describes the experience this way: "A veil is lifted and it takes 
everyone over. It's almost as if I'm possessed. The music is that powerful. Our 
goal is to bring everyone together with our music." 
</P>
<P>
The costume of masquerade of festivals is also steeped in traditions that can 
be traced to the days of slavery and rule by European colonists. Jamaica's 
Junkanoo traditionally celebrated in late December, today is often presented on 
important state occasions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Masks Came in Handy 
</P>
<P>
Junkanoo is the perfect illustration of African and European influences, 
according to Judith Bettelheim, co-curator of "Caribbean Festival Arts" and 
professor of art at San Francisco State University. The masks worn during 
festivals came in handy during the years before emancipation, she said, since 
slaves could make fun of their owners during festivals while remaining 
anonymous behind their disguises. 
</P>
<P>
Costumes are also essential to Carnival, and today many people begin planning 
next year's creation the minute this year's festival is over. 
</P>
<P>
Masquerade bands number from 100 to 5,000 members; a band leader sets the theme 
for his group, which can be literally anything under the sun -- from sailors to 
extraterrestrials. A 1981 band, "Jungle Fever," organized by Trinidad's Peter 
Minshall, required 2,500 costumes, 15 seamstresses and more than two dozen 
painters and decorators. The band's most spectacular costume measured 15-by-2O 
feet and sparkled with 220,000 hand-stitched sequins. Regardless of theme, the 
bands' most elaborate masquerades are made of wire structures covered with 
brilliantly colored and decorated fabric. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes and bands are different every year but, according to poet Lashley, 
a veteran of more than 20 Carnivals, a traditional Carnival will include at 
least one American Indian, a sailor and a casual, randomly costumed Ole Mas 
(Masquerade) band. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costumes a Treasure 
</P>
<P>
Roslyn Ledley, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., said she began wearing costumes at 
Carnival as a child when she would "dress in a little nonsense." She now 
treasures her costumes. "I feel so good because other people can see what we 
can do with a few pieces of material," Ledley said. "We make these costumes 
come alive in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibition curator John Nunley of the St. Louis Art Museum sees the costumes 
themselves as art. "These modern urban costume designers," he said, "are 
artists who use non-traditional objects -- tinsel, aluminum, mirrors and bottle 
caps -- to fashion their masquerades, which remind me of dancing mobiles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the almost magical combination of music and masquerade that makes these 
festivals unique," Nunley added. "The costumes are a visual art but the rhythm 
and beat of the music is what draws people into the celebration." 
</P>
<P>
Trinidad hosts what one guidebook calls the "granddaddy of all festivals." 
Carnival-goers begin preparation in January when costumes are designed and 
steel-band rehearsals begin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King and Queen Named 
</P>
<P>
On the Friday before Carnival, celebrated during the week before Ash Wednesday, 
contests are held to select the king and queen. On Saturday, thousands of 
schoolchildren play mas on the streets of Port-of-Spain and that evening the 
steel-band competition, or Pan-O-Rama, is held. Bands play through the night 
and on Sunday in preparation for Jouvay (from the French for opening day) 
Monday, when bands parade through the streets of the city to Independence 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Carnival's grand finale, the air is filled with the sounds of 
soca, calypso and steel bands as the revelers parade over an outdoor stage to 
show off their costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival is as unique to Trinidad as Junkanoo is to Jamaica. But, in their own 
ways, they are unifying events. "The festivals of these islands are what bring 
the various elements of the diverse cultures together," the Smithsonian's Hyatt 
said. "It is the one art form that cuts across the social and economic 
stratification that is so prevalent in the Caribbean."
