   Caribbean leaders Saturday condemned
the attempted overthrow of the government of Trinidad and Tobago.
Jamaica and Barbados put their armies on alert in case Trinidad's
government asks for help.
   Several Caribbean heads of state and government officials were
in Jamaica to attend a summit of the Caribbean Economic Community.
The meeting starts Sunday.
   Trinidad Prime Minister Arthur N. Robinson, who has been held
hostage since Friday by black Moslem rebels in Port-of-Spain,
Trinidad's capital, is an influential figure within the community
and had planned to attend the summit.
   Trinidad and Tobago, with a population of 1.3 million, is the
second largest member after Jamaica in the 13-nation Caribbean
community, which groups 11 island nations as well as Guyana and
Belize.
   Percival J. Patterson, acting prime minister of Jamaica, said
his country's defense force was being readied in the event the
community was asked to provide military assistance.
   ``The army has been placed on full alert,'' Patterson said after
a meeting in Kingston with other Caribbean leaders who had arrived
early for the summit.
   Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford of Barbados said his island
nation's army had also been placed on alert.
   ``Barbados supports democratic government, and where such
governments are overthrown or threatened by illegal means, we will
not support this,'' Sandiford said. ``If any request is made we
will consider assistance.''
   In Dominica, Prime Minister Eugenia Charles called for an end to
the takeover attempt.
   ``We cannot allow this nonsense,'' said Ms. Charles, who asked
for U.S. military intervention in Grenada in 1983 after a bloody
coup there.
   Troops from the Caribbean community provided token support for
the invading U.S. forces, which ousted the Marxist military junta
that took power after killing Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and
several government ministers.
   Lynden Pindling, prime minister of the Bahamas, also pledged
Saturday ``to render whatever assistance'' possible if Trinidad's
government asks for help from the Caribbean organization.
   Pindling did not indicate, however, whether his administration
was willing to consider military assistance.
   Trinidad's foreign minister, Sahadeo Basdeo, who had led a
delegation to pre-summit discussions in Kingston, said Saturday
afternoon that he would attempt to return home to assess the
situation.
   ``We are pleading with the rebels to free the prime minister and
to talk about their problems,'' Basdeo said. ``We are pleading for
common sense and rationality to prevail, and for a restoration of
democracy.''
   In Port-of-Spain, Acting Foreign Minister Edden Shand, who was
released by the rebels Saturday, made a statement on radio opposing
any foreign military intervention.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush and national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft were ``following the situation carefully,''
said deputy press secretary Alixe Glen.
   In Caracas, the Venezuelan government said it would not
recognize any rebel government in Trinidad and Tobago, a former
British colony of two islands which lies off Venezuela's coast.
   ``Venezuela ... energetically rejects this attempt to overthrow
the constitutional government,'' said the statement released
Saturday by the government news agency Venpres.
   Trinidad and Tobago is one of 48 members of the Commonwealth, an
association of Britain and its former colonies. In London, the
Commonwealth secretary general on Saturday called the attempted
coup ``unwelcome and unacceptable.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, another Commonwealth
member, called for the immediate release of Robinson and other
government hostages.
