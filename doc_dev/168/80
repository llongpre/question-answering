The Caribbean Community (Caricom) and its two largest members have asked to
be listed as eligible for membership of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, while they continue seeking arrangements for special access which
will protect their US and Canadian markets against competition from Mexico
exports, writes Canute James in Kingston.
Caribbean trade officials have said, however, that it is unlikely that the
three Nafta signatories will show any early interest in Caricom's desire,
and that of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, to be considered a part of the
free trade area. More immediate attention will be on the larger markets in
Latin America, the trade officials said.
Trinidad and Tobago has already satisfied some conditions for Nafta entry,
having already implemented wide economic reforms, said Mr Ken Valley, the
country's trade and industry minister.
