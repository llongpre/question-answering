CARIBBEAN countries are preparing to combat cholera which is threatening to
reach the islands after sweeping through Latin America. Officials say
fighting an epidemic would be costly for the financially-strapped
governments, and could severely damage the region's tourist industry, on
which many island economies depend heavily.
Three confirmed cases in Belize in Central America have increased concern in
the islands.
Although there have been no deaths from the disease in the islands, the
Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, which operates in 19 countries, has said
preparations are being made to contain it. The infiltration of cholera is
'inevitable,' according to Dr Franklin White, director of the centre.
However, 'the potential for transmission of the disease would be limited in
most of the Caribbean countries because of a more favourable environmental
health situation compared with Latin American nations'.
The appearance of the disease in Venezuela has caused the government of
Trinidad and Tobago to declare a health alert. 'The latest report on cases
in Venezuela means that cholera is now in our backyard, a mere seven miles
away,' said Mr John Eckstein, Trinidad and Tobago's health minister.
He said cholera could not be kept out, given the movement of people between
Trinidad and the mainland.
