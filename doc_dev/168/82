  [Text] George Town, Grand Cayman, CANA--Nearly 700 pounds 
of marijuana in plastic and burlap bags was found in the bush on 
a remote Cayman Islands beach last weekend. 
  A police spokesperson said the actual weight of the 
marijuana 
came to 697.5 pounds. The marijuana was contained in 23 separate 
bags that were marked "Jamaica" on the outside, he said. 
  The marijuana appeared to be professionally packaged and 
intended for trans-shipment to another destination, most likely 
the United States, the spokesperson said. 
  The drug had a street value of approximately US$850,000. 
  Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts said the large 
amounts of marijuana and cocaine found on Cayman beaches 
recently "indicate the islands are still being used to ship 
drugs from Jamaica and Honduras to the United States." 
  Travellers from the Caymans, particularly U.S. citizens who 
have been on vacation here, are seldom searched or detained when 
clearing customs at Miami International or other U.S. airports, 
officials here say. 
  Three U.S. nationals have been arrested here in the past six 
months and charged with transporting drugs back to the United 
States. 
  All have admitted they were recruited to be "mules" by local 
residents who offered them a week's vacation in the Cayman 
Islands in return for ferrying marijuana and cocaine back to the 
States.
