A battered and bruised Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson made his first public 
appearance in a television interview broadcast Saturday and said that radical 
Muslim rebels who staged a coup attempt shot him as he lay on his stomach in 
the Parliament building calling for Trinidad forces to attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouted, 'Murderers! Torturers!' and I called upon the forces outside to 
attack with full force," he said in the interview taped Friday from his 
hospital bed. "And then it was while I was lying on my face, I was shot in the 
leg." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was wounded a week ago Friday after the Muslim fundamentalist rebels 
led by Yasin abu Bakr stormed the country's Parliament and state television 
station, taking more than 45 hostages in a bloody, five-day standoff. It ended 
Wednesday with the hostages' release and the rebels' unconditional surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Looking tired and shaken and with bruises on his face, Robinson, 63, called on 
Trinidadians to keep the faith and thanked the nation and foreign heads of 
state who had expressed their solidarity and offered support. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in good shape now," Robinson said. "I know it has been a trying period, 
and even if we who were in the Red House (Parliament) were in pain, in my mind 
the welfare of the country was foremost." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson condemned the rebellion, saying the coup attempt was not a popular 
uprising and that he felt relief that the people rallied behind the government. 
</P>
<P>
"The violent attack on Parliament is something absolutely new in our experience 
and in our view should never be allowed to happen again," he said. "It was a 
violation of every code in civilized society and a throwback of 300 years." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson described the treatment he and about 17 other ministers and 
legislators received during the 91-hour stretch as hostages, saying he had no 
choice but to at least pretend to cooperate with rebel demands. 
</P>
<P>
"We were humiliated, roughed-up, and we suffered extremely excruciating pain. I 
called on the forces outside to attack with all their resources, and that was 
when I was shot in the leg," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, army troops and police searched the island, tracking down holdouts 
from the Muslim group, uncovering weapons and killing the rebel leader's 
stepson in the mop-up operation. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. David Williams, an army spokesman, said his troops found eight bodies 
Friday in the Parliament building and collected 93 weapons in a sweep through 
the compound where the Muslim rebels lived. 
</P>
<P>
He also reported the death of Njassane Omuaali, 21, stepson of rebel leader Abu 
Bakr and a student at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Williams reported 
that Omuaali, who was on summer vacation in Trinidad, was killed in a gun 
battle with police who found him in the town of Curepe, five miles east of Port 
of Spain, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the coup attempt sparked violence and widespread looting 
and destruction in the capital, claiming at least 30 lives and causing millions 
of dollars worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, it was reported that more than 300 died and about 1,000 were 
injured in the failed coup. 
</P>
<P>
The island continued to stagger Saturday from the aftereffects of the crisis. 
Food and gasoline remained scarce, and long lines formed outside grocery 
stores. Most supermarkets and banks remained closed.
