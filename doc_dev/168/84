BRITAIN will be asked this week to take a more active role in efforts to
resolve the political situation in Haiti, and to encourage its European
Community partners to support moves to restore democratic government to the
Caribbean state.
The request will be put to Mr John Major, UK prime minister, by Mr Patrick
Manning, his Trinidad and Tobago counterpart and chairman of the Caribbean
Community. He will arrive in London today on an official visit.
'We have managed to get the matter to the United Nations, but we do not have
a resolution of the Haitian situation,' Mr Manning said. 'We need the
attention of the EC and to bring more pressure to bear', so as to resolve
the dispute between exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the military
which ousted him.
Mr Manning will also discuss with Mr Major the continuing concerns of
Caribbean Community leaders over access of the region's bananas to the EC.
He will repeat these concerns when he visits Germany this week. The Germans
are unhappy with proposals from the EC farm ministers which would put under
quota bananas imported from Latin America, while guaranteeing access for
fruit from traditional suppliers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific
Group.
The Trinidadian leader will also meet representatives of the British
financial services sector and the oil industry, seeking investments in the
Caribbean republic. His administration is trying to make the country the
business and financial capital of the Caribbean.
Last month, the Trinidadian government deregulated the local foreign
exchange market.
