THE Trinidad and Tobago dollar fell 26 per cent against the US dollar
yesterday when currency markets reopened following a government announcement
that the currency was being floated.
The rate, which has been fixed at 4.25 to the US dollar since 1989, is being
determined by commercial banks and licensed foreign exchange dealers,
according to Mr Wendell Mottley, finance minister.
The central bank said foreign reserves were 'under pressure because of debt
servicing obligations and flight of capital' from the country. 'As long as
the reserves remain low, and as long as economic activity and business
confidence continues to be depressed, there will be speculation about a
possible devaluation, leading in turn to capital flight,' it said. An
average USDollars 200m in capital left Trinidad and Tobago every year
between 1986 and 1991, it added.
The Caribbean republic's economy is 70 per cent dependent on its petroleum
industry. Foreign debt stands at USDollars 2.29bn.
Yesterday's exchange rate was agreed in advance by the government and the
commercial banks, and was set slightly above that prevailing on the growing
unofficial foreign currency market.
Bankers said yesterday that they expected fluctuations in the exchange rate
later this week when levels of supply and demand became clear.
Mr Terrence Farrell, deputy governor of the central bank, said: 'What one is
striving for is a regime that is flexible, with the rate moving from day to
day, from week to week, but that generally, the rate will be moving to what
I call a zone of stability.'
There would not be 'wild and large fluctuations' as happened in other
countries, he said.
