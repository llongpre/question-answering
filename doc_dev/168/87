  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 22 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad 
and Tobago's Prime Minister Patrick Manning on Friday night 
announced a mini cabinet reshuffle which saw additional 
responsibilities for some senior ministers. The cabinet 
reshuffle followed the resignation of Trade, Industry and 
Tourism Minister Brian Kuei Tung who at the beginning of the 
month said he wanted to pursue other career options. 
  In the reshuffle, Junior Finance Minister Ken Valley, who is 
considered to be one of the most productive ministers in the 
government, will now have additional responsibilities for trade 
and industry. The local government ministry which was handled by 
Valley was shifted to the minister of works and transport, Colm 
Imbert. Finance Minister Wendell Mottley was given the 
additional portfolio of the tourism ministry. 
  In addition, Manning announced the creation of a Ministry of 
Social Development which will be handled by Senator Camille 
Regis- Robinson, who will continue as minister in the office of 
the prime minister. 
  In a wide-ranging address to the nation, in which he raised 
concerns about the upsurge in violent crime and gave an up-date 
about the state of the economy, Manning said in the rebuilding 
of the country's economy, government has to devote time to the 
details of tourism and agricultural promotion. 
  "As we make this shift, we found it necessary to make some 
corresponding organisational adjustments in the government," he 
said. "Mr Brian Kuei Tung, the minister of trade, industry and 
tourism leaves the government (on Friday). I would like to thank 
him for the tremendous effort that he has exerted in the 
discharge of his responsibilities over the last two years and to 
wish him well in his new pursuits. 
  "In accordance with the government's priorities for the 
development of the tourism sector in the context of job creation 
and the need to accelerate the process of streamlining 
administrative procedures to attract greater levels of 
investment, there will now be a separate Ministry of Tourism." 
  Expressing concern about crime in the country, which he 
described as "callous brutality," the prime minister announced 
that from Monday, members of the Defence Force will be brought 
out onto the streets on foot patrol. 
  "The government feels justified in taking this course of 
action in the light of the anxiety of citizens over the 
situation." 
  Manning also said that in seeking to make the operations of 
the police more efficient, cabinet has accepted proposals which 
envisage the establishment of a nine-person police service board 
of management appointed by the president after consultation with 
the government and opposition. 
  The minister of national security, the police service 
commission, and the commissioner of police in recent times had 
become embroiled in an issue involving the discipline of police 
officers. Manning said that opposition leader Basdeo Panday was 
informed of the proposal and government now awaits a reply. "The 
board will have the authority to manage the police service and 
to deal with the recruitment of all levels of police personnel 
from the rank of constable to the rank of assistant 
commissioner," said Manning. 
  "The commissioner of police will be responsible for the 
discipline of officers in the ranks of constable to inspector. 
The police service commission in this model will become an 
appeal tribunal and will also have the power to discipline the 
commissioner of police and deputy commissioners of police." 
  The proposal further envisages that both the police service 
board of management and the police service commission will be 
accountable to a committee of parliament. 
  "In addition to all of this, the proposals call for an 
appointment of an inspector of police service whose 
responsibility would be to keep the minister of national 
security up-to-date on the performance of the police services," 
said Manning. He added that disciplinary proceedings could be 
instituted against individuals in the service, based on reports 
from the proposed inspector. 
  Speaking on the economy of the country, Manning described 
1993 as being a "difficult year," which saw a double blow from 
low oil prices and falling oil production, while an 
unprecedented level of debt repayment had to be sustained. 
  "All of this translated into money worries which forced the 
government to cut back expenditure in many areas," he said, 
adding that through the sacrifice government had been able to 
lay a solid foundation on which to build in 1994. He told the 
nation that government was successful in diversifying the 
economy away from the exclusive dependence on oil. He said that 
in 1984, government's revenues were 42 percent dependent on oil, 
while in 1993, it was only 27 percent dependent. 
  "So that unwelcome though the present oil prices are, we are 
infinitely better able to sustain them than we are in 1984. Even 
so, the repercussions of developments in the oil industry remain 
too significant to be left to the vagaries of the international 
oil market. Whereas we cannot control price, we have some 
influence on our production," said Manning. He said government 
has been working with several mulitlateral petroleum companies 
in Trinidad and the local petroleum company to offset the fall 
in oil prices.
