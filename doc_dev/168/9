   The State Department said Monday there are no
plans for U.S. military intervention to bring an end to the
Moslem-led insurrection against the elected government in Trinidad.
   While refusing comment on reports of U.S. military maneuvers in
the area, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher suggested that a
military solution had been ruled out.
   At the same time, Boucher criticized Libya's involvement with
the rebels, saying it has provided some training for the
insurgents. But he said there was no apparent direct link between
Libya and hostage-taking which occurred last Friday.
   Abu Bakr, the leader of a Moslem sect, launched the coup attempt
by seizing the Parliament building in Port-of-Spain and capturing
Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson and about 40 other hostages.
   Robinson and one other goverment minister were believed to have
been shot in the leg early in the coup attempt, and both have been
getting medical attention, said Bernard W. Aronson, assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   Trinidad government spokesman Gregory Shaw identified the second
victim as Justice Minister Selwyn Richardson, and said both men
were in stable condition. Shaw said Robinson had been shot in both
feet, not the legs
   Aronson, who spoke in an interview on the ``MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' on the Public Broadcasting System, also said people were
killed in the coup attempt but said the department did not have a
figure on the casualties. He said none of them was a high-ranking
government official, but he declined to identify the victims
further.
   The Trinidad crisis has some of the earmarks of the situation in
Grenada seven years ago when a radical leftist movement took power.
In that case, the United States and several other Caribbean
countries decided to oust the radicals.
   As in Grenada, the insurgents have shown a willingness to use
extremist methods to advance their cause.
   In both Grenada and Trinidad, there were signs of involvement by
anti-American elements from abroad. In Grenada, the leadership
there had close links to Cuba while in Trinidad, Libya has been
allied with the rebels. Also, in both cases, a major concern of
Washington has been the well being of thousands of Americans
residing in the two countries.
   But a major difference between the two situations is that
whereas virtually all of the Americans in Grenada were students at
a medical school, the 6,000 Americans in Trinidad are dispersed
around the island and are less vulnerable to a mass hostage-taking.
   The international political climate also has undergone a
dramatic transformation since 1983, a period when Cold War tensions
were at a peak.
   There is little indication that the events in Trinidad will have
an impact beyond that country's borders. This was not the case in
1983, when members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
asked for the dispatch of U.S. troops.
   Beyond that, American officials said government officials in
Trinidad have indicated a desire to resolve the crisis without
outside help.
