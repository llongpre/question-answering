Caribbean governments must continue to restructure their economies in order
to deal with rapid changes in the global environment, according to the
annual report of the Caribbean Development Bank, published this week.
In a review of its members' economies, the bank which is based in Barbados,
said that the medium-term prospects for Caribbean economies were not
encouraging due to increased pressure on both the private and public sectors
to become more open and more efficient in order to meet the demands of trade
liberalisation.
Without sustained growth in the industrialised economies and changes in
domestic economic policy, the Caribbean region can expect no better than the
moderate levels of growth which most countries in the region recorded last
year, the bank cautioned.
The bank said that whilst some of its borrowing members recorded relatively
high levels of growth last year, the majority turned in a disappointing
performance 'with growth remaining in the lower ranges.' Unemployment rates
stayed high and the fiscal situation of many governments remained tight.
Growth rates of between 7.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in gross domestic
product were recorded last year by some countries, including Guyana, the
Cayman Islands and Belize, the bank reported. Lower than expected earnings
from banana exports adversely affected growth in the Windward Islands of
Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent, the report continued.
Jamaica recorded low growth because of marginal expansion in bauxite and
agricultural commodities, while Trinidad and Tobago's economy contracted
because of the weak state of the international market for oil, the country's
main export.
'The resumption of economic growth in North America had a positive impact on
visitor arrivals in a number of member countries,' the report noted. While
most resort countries in the region benefited from the increase in stay over
visitors and cruise ship calls last year, the industry in the Bahamas
remained weak, the bank said.
The tourism sector will be among the first to reflect an improvement in the
resumption of growth in the main markets, the CDB predicted.
Fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate led to a decline in banana
production and exports, particularly from the Windward Islands. The industry
was affected by changes in banana marketing arrangements in Europe, 'which
will at the outset provide increased access for lower cost Latin American
fruit and eventually result in the phasing out of preferential market access
from traditional countries,' said the CDB.
Cumulative sugar production in the bank's members last year was 732,000
tonnes, three per cent less than 1992 production. The largest fall of 10 per
cent was in Barbados, while the biggest absolute decline was in Jamaica
where production fell 7,900 tonnes.
A fall in crude oil production in Trinidad and Tobago will continue, said
the bank, 'with the outlook for international prices not being particularly
encouraging given the inability of Opec members to limit output to agreed
production quotas, and given the likelihood of the eventual return of Iraqi
production to world markets.'
Weak international prices for aluminium depressed the mining and refining of
bauxite in Jamaica and Guyana last year, the report noted.
The bank concluded that the region is likely to find increasing difficultly
in obtaining external funding, citing the trend for traditional donors to
now consider what they perceive as more pressing needs in eastern Europe and
Africa.
