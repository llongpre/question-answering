TRINIDAD AND Tobago's nitrogenous fertiliser output slipped 4 per cent last
year to 2.36m tonnes, mainly because of plant closures for maintenance, the
country's central bank has reported. Exports by the Caribbean state, a major
supplier to the US and western Europe, were 2.08m tonnes, marginally less
than in 1991.
Government officials say the country is now among the world's largest
producers of nitrogenous fertilisers with installed capacity of 2.5m tonnes
per year.
Last month the government sold its wholly owned urea plant and its 51 per
cent stake in an ammonia plant to Arcadian Partners of Tennessee, a major
producer of fertilisers, for USDollars 175m.
