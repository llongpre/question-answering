THE STATE-OWNED Trinidad and Tobago Oil Company has received a USDollars 18m
loan from the Caribbean Development Bank to help finance a programme for
on-shore and off-shore secondary oil recovery and to improve the volume of
refinery throughput.
The bank, based in Barbados, said the Trinidadian project would cost Dollars
411m, and that financing was also being obtained from the Inter-American
Development Bank, the Japan Import-Export Bank, the Commonwealth Development
Corporation, the European Investment Bank and the oil company.
The programme will double the capacity of the company's refinery at
Pointe-a-Pierre in Southern Trinidad, the bank said, and the increased
demand for crude will be met by improving the secondary oil recovery
on-shore and off-shore.
It is anticipated that the programme will yield the secondary recovery of
just over 13m barrels of heavy crude from onshore fields in the first phase.
This will be followed by the secondary recovery of 17m barrels of lighter
crude from offshore fields. Refinery throughput, which has been about
100,000 barrels a day, will be increased when capacity is expanded to
160,000 b/d.
