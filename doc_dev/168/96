   President Bush went boating in the
early morning fog, attended church and hit the tennis courts Sunday
while monitoring the progress of a coup attempt in Trinidad.
   Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, were
kept abreast of developments in the Trinidadian capital of
Port-of-Spain, where rebels were holding Prime Minister Arthur
Robinson and several ministers hostage.
   Bush took his speedboat Fidelity out for an early morning spin
in the Atlantic while fog still blanketed the rugged coastline
around Walker's Point.
   Photographers in a chase boat lost track of the president, and
overheard on marine radio a call to local Kennebunkport fire
authorities for a rescue boat. That gave rise to rumors that Bush
might have lost his way in the fog.
   But a presidential spokeswoman said later that was not the case.
   ``The president's boat was fine. There was some `Rescue 1'
request that was heard ... but that was completely unrelated to the
president,'' deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said.
   ``There's always a Coast Guard boat with him, and they have the
best radar systems one can have,'' she said.
   She denied that the Coast Guard had to show Bush the way back to
Walker's Point.
   ``I cannot tell you whether there was any fish caught.
Regardless, the president's boat was always in control,'' she added.
   After hitting the local golf course Friday as soon as he arrived
in Maine, Bush managed to skip golf the rest of this sunny weekend.
He often golfs daily here, even in the rain.
   Bush attended the wedding of a cousin's son on Saturday at St.
Ann's Episcopal Church, the same stone church where the Bushes
attended services Sunday.
   Bush was returning to Washington on Sunday without wife Barbara,
who planned to spend the entire month of August here with Bush
children and grandchildren. The president was to return here Aug.
10 and stay until Labor Day.
   Bush will resume deficit reductions talks with leaders of
Congress this week. On Thursday he flies to Aspen, Colo., to
address the Aspen Institute and meet with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. The institute sponsors seminars on both domestic
and international issues.
   Bush will spend Thursday night in the Rockies and fly back
Friday to spend a bachelor weekend at the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md.
