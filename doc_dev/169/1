<LEADPARA>  The Canadian government and leaders of Eskimos in the central and eastern
Arctic reached agreement Monday on a massive land claim settlement that would
divide the Northwest Territories and create a sprawling new territory called
Nunavut whose size would exceed that of California and Alaska combined.;  
Under the agreement, the 17,000 Eskimos in the region would be granted
self-government rights over part of the new territory and would become the
biggest landowners in North America. The Eskimos also would retain hunting,
fishing and other rights elsewhere in Nunavut, a 772,000-square-mile expanse
partly administered by federal authorities that would represent a fifth of
Canada's total land mass.  </LEADPARA>

SETTLEMENT WILL SPLIT NORTHWEST TERRITORIES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The accord is subject to approval by the Canadian Parliament and a
plebiscite among all 52,000 people living in the Northwest Territories.;  
Under the redrawing of the Canadian map, the Eskimos would take legal title to
136,000 square miles of disputed land stretching from the Manitoba border to
the North Pole. They also would receive nearly $1 billion over 14 years,
including interest payments.;   In return, the Eskimos would relinquish title
claims to about 80 percent of their ancestral land, including areas believed
to contain lucrative oil and gas fields. But they would retain some governing
rights in that area.;   The region covered by the agreement consists mostly of
frozen tundra and wilderness islands of the Arctic archipelago. Eighty percent
of the population is Eskimo. The land claim settlement, the biggest in
Canada's history, was announced in Ottawa by Native Affairs Minister Thomas
Siddon and leaders of the Tengavik Federation of Nunavut, the political
organization of Arctic Eskimos, also known as Inuit.;   The two sides agreed
to negotiate a formal political accord creating the territory of Nunavut and
establishing the terms of its financing. Nunavut -- "Land of the People" in
the Inuit language -- would join the Yukon and the Northwest Territories as
the third of Canada's nominally self-governing territories without provincial
status.  </TEXT>
