<LEADPARA>  The Canadian government in Ottawa has tentatively awarded the Inuit people of
northern Canada with rights to an area of land five times the size of
California, a minister said today. The settlement divides in two Canada's
Northwest Territories and ends 15 years of talks on the Inuit's claim to vast
portions of the land they have lived in for thousands of years. The government
recognizes their right to the land in principal, but will give up only some of
it.;   Under the weekend agreement, the Inuit will receive $580 million ($522
million U.S.) over 14 years, along with the right to hunt, fish and trap
anywhere in a new territory to be known as Nunavut, an area of 740,000 square
miles, and title to 135,000 square miles of that land. Nunavut -- which will
be cut off from the eastern half of the Northwest Territories -- is about the
size of Newfoundland and Labrador, and about five times the size of California.  </LEADPARA>
