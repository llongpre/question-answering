   The U.S. and Canada signed an Arctic cooperation agreement, which is designed to defuse a longstanding dispute arising from Canada's claims to sovereignty over the Arctic Islands' waters. 

   Under the agreement, the U.S. pledges that navigation by its icebreakers within waters claimed by Canada as internal will be undertaken with the Canadian government's consent. 

   The pact was signed at a meeting between Secretary of State George Shultz and External Affairs Minister Joe Clark. 

   The U.S. recognizes Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic Islands, but not over their waters. 
The Reagan administration has said recognition of Canada's claims would set a precedent that could jeopardize U.S. shipping rights in disputed waters elsewhere in the world. 

   In a statement in Washington, President Reagan said the agreement "is a pragmatic solution based on our special bilateral relationship, our common interest in cooperating on Arctic matters, and the nature of the area. 
It is without prejudice to our respective legal positions and it sets no precedents for other areas." 

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said that, "While we and the U.S. haven't changed our legal positions, we have come to a practical agreement that is fully consistent with the requirements of Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic." 

   The issue became a pressing political matter after the U.S. Coast Guard in the summer of 1985 sent an ice breaker, the Polar Sea, through the Arctic waters on a supply mission from Greenland to Alaska. 
The voyage provoked protests from many Canadians who viewed it as a flagrant violation of that country's sovereignty. 

   To assert Canada's Arctic rights, the Mulroney government has ordered construction of what is expected to be the world's largest icebreaker and has announced plans to order 10 to 12 nuclear-powered submarines capable of operating under the Arctic ice. 

   Mr. Shultz told reporters the U.S. would "fully cooperate" with Canada's plan to expand its submarine fleet. 

   Mr. Shultz also said he was confident Congress will approve the U.S.-Canada trade agreement signed by Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mulroney Jan. 2. 
He predicted the agreement would win wide support because it is "fundamentally a good thing" for both countries. 
The agreement, which takes effect Jan. 1, 1989, provides for elimination of tariffs and many other trade barriers between the two countries. 

   Questioned about Canada's concerns on acid rain, Mr. Shultz said that while the two countries have differing views on the issue progress is being made. 
Canada blames much of its acid-rain problem on wind-carried pollution from power and industrial plants in the U.S. Midwest. 
It has urged the Reagan administration to take tougher action to deal with the problem. 

   Mr. Shultz and Mr. Clark signed a protocol broadening the U.S.-Canada extradition treaty. 
It now permits extradition to be sought for such offenses as parental childnapping, tax evasion and escape from prison.
