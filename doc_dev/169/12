   Most of its 870,240 square miles is covered with ice 2{ miles
thick, but the ice-free area is still half the size of Texas.
   The southern coasts are snowless and verdant in summer, and it
was here that the Scandinavian Vikings landed 1,000 years ago and
gave the country its somewhat misleading name.
   Eric the Red, a hero of Icelandic sagas, established tiny
colonies that eked out a living for 500 years before mysteriously
dying out.
   Nuuk sits on a long strip of land between two fiords, with
mountains rising on either side like sentinels. Long rows of
publicly built five-story apartment blocks give the city an air of
drabness.
   Today four out of five inhabitants are native Inuits, who are
related by language and custom to the Eskimos of Alaska, Canada and
Siberia.
   But 60 percent of the country's administration is run by Danes.
   Jonathan Motzfeldt, who has been prime minister since autonomy
was granted, says the goal is for Greenlanders to take over
entirely. In its first autonomous decade, he says, ``Greenland
already has undergone a silent revolution,'' and he wants it to
become more self-reliant.
   Motzfeldt has announced deep cuts in social benefits, especially
to the unemployed. From now on, he says, welfare clients who refuse
a job offer in the summer will not be eligible for cash benefits.
   The Greenland government also has taken its first international
loan of about $166 million, in German marks and Japanese yen.
   Denmark's rule over Greenland dates to 1776, when it set up a
trade monopoly and established missionary stations along the coast.
   The Americans came during World War II, when Greenland was a
midway staging area and refueling stop for troop transports and
equipment on the way to the European theater.
   U.S. forces also supplied the Greenlanders with food and
essentials after the Nazis occupied Denmark, which old-timers still
remember.
   In the early 1950s the U.S. military built defense installations
across Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland known as the Distant
Early Warning System, or DEW Line.
   The philosophy then was that the shortest distance between two
superpowers, as the bomber or ballistic missile flies, is over the
arctic. But the stations have become outdated and are coming down.
   The U.S. pullout from Sondre Stromfjord also is exacerbating
tensions with Greenland over the Thule radar base, an important
link for U.S. defenses in its ballistic missile warning system.
   Thule was once a tiny Inuit hunting and trapping village. Under
the U.S.-Danish Defense Agreement of 1951, the U.S. military
relocated the native people and built a big phased-array radar.
   It has been a bone of contention between the United States and
the Soviet Union, which claims the modernization of Thule in recent
years was a breach of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.
   Though it is a source of income for Greenland, it is a political
embarrassment for Motzfeldt, who is under pressure from leftists
who want to get rid of the base. Motzfeldt grumbles about Thule as
``that stupid radar.''
   Denmark, mindful of its commitments to NATO, supports the U.S.
position that Thule is ``non-offensive,'' and the Greenland
administration has little choice but to fall in line.
   Motzfeldt has intimated that the Americans won't be welcome in
Thule unless they agree to continue paying for Sondre Stromfjord's
civilian airport.
   ``We are not going to pay money to have the American bases
here,'' Motzfeldt says. ``On the contrary, we insist that civilian
people have the advantage of the Americans' presence.''
   Despite all of its problems, the latest news of the gold find
should help make the future brighter. For the first Christmas in a
long time, the world can truly say, ``Yes, Greenland, there is a
Santa Claus.''
