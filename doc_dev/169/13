   Native people of the north are
preparing to take on the anti-fur movement _ not on the tundra, but
in the marketplace.
   Two native groups in Alaska and Canada plan to seek out small
markets to sell native-trapped and-sewn fur clothing. But animal
rights activists contend the embryonic plans are doomed, and
promise to oppose the products as much as they do furs from
non-native trappers and marketers.
   ``We have no problems with native subsistence wildlife killing
as long as its done as humanely as possible,'' said Michael
O'Sullivan, spokesman for the World Society for the Protection of
Animals in Toronto.
   ``But we cannot accept commercial fur sales. It's not who
carries out the activity, but the activity itself,'' he said.
   Alaska's Athabascan Indians and the Inuit Eskimos of Canada
retort that the animal protectionists appear to care little about
the human suffering caused by native unemployment, or about the
survival of native cultures.
   And anti-fur activists, they say, would open the door to other
forms of development that would be far more threatening to the
environment and animals.
   Their anger at the anti-fur forces has simmered for years, but
it was just three years ago that they formed Indigenous Survival
International, a militant native group that spans Alaska, Canada
and Greenland.
   The marketing strategy was the group's idea.
   If all goes according to plan, Alaska Athabascans, through their
Yukon Flats Fur Cooperative, soon will seek markets in the United
States and Europe for furs labeled ``Authentic Native Design.''
   They hope to sell through small stores, preferably owned by
natives. They envision consumers who will buy their coats, hats,
boots and other articles more for their native artistry than for
reasons of fashion.
   The plan was forged after the cooperative sold just $150,000
worth of furs in the past two years. That small return has
endangered the cooperative because banks refuse to loan it money,
said Clarence Alexander, the Athabascan chief for the village of
Fort Yukon.
   Alexander, an Indigenous Survival International member, said his
people hoped to generate the modest amounts of cash they need to
supplement a subsistence economy based mostly on hunting, trapping,
fishing and gathering.
   ``Subsistence societies like the Athabascans and the Inuit need
a little cash to buy gas for boats, to heat with oil, to buy
ammunition,'' said Robert Higgins, a spokesman for the Canadian
Inuit's umbrella organization, Inuit Tapirisat in Ottawa.
   Fur sales are their only ready source of cash, he said.
   The organization wants to revive the harvest of adult ringed
seals as a way of returning Canada's 28,000 Inuit to a subsistence
economy, Higgins said.
   Their sealing-based culture was devastated by a powerful
anti-sealing movement that caught on in 1983. The impetus was
photographs _ grisly pictures of non-native sealers clubbing Harp
seal pups to death off Newfoundland.
   Higgins said his group primarily wants to replace the Inuits'
store-bought food and clothing with seal meat and fur. But the
Inuit also will sell native-made fur clothing to raise cash, he
said.
   Anti-fur advocates accept native people's need to trap and shoot
animals for their own needs, said Pat Ragan, the program director
of wildlife for the Humane Society of the United States in
Washington, D.C.
   But ``to kill animals to market skins is another thing
altogether,'' she said. ``The only hope for these people is to get
away from marketing furs. We acknowledge that there are problems
with that, but I don't think selling furs is the way to solve
them.''
   Her group offers no alternatives to the native fur trade. ``Of
course we don't have an official position on that,'' she said.
``Our job is protecting animals.''
   Tom Morse, an Anchorage anti-fur activist, said natives wouldn't
need cash if they would return completely to the old ways. ``They
were heating their homes before the white man brought oil,'' and
snaring animals before white trappers introduced the steel leghold
trap, he said.
   ``They have the freedom to follow their own lifestyle. But when
they start combining cultures, the results have been disastrous,''
said Morse, a physics instructor at the University of Alaska in
Anchorage.
   Alexander reacted angrily to that logic.
   ``Some of us would like to return completely to the old ways,''
but the presence of non-natives and their competition for resources
makes that impossible, the Athabascan leader said.
   ``We have always been and still are a non-cash society, but we
are forced now to need some cash,'' Alexander said. Northern
natives, he said, could reject Western tools such as outboard
engines, guns and heating oil only if Morse and the non-native
populations left.
   In destroying the native fur trade, native leaders say, the
anti-fur movement is laying the groundwork for destruction of
animal habitat.
   They point to the Pribilof Islands, where the Aleuts hunted
seals for centuries. Then Congress ended the harvest in 1985,
limiting the killings to those used for food, and the federal
government withdrew subsidies for the Aleuts.
   ``Literally overnight, we had human suffering, suicides, more
than 100 documented attempted suicides, massive anxiety, and a
200-percent increase in the cost of groceries from the loss of the
subsidies,'' said Larry Merculieff, a leader of the Aleut islanders
and commissioner of the state Department of Commerce and Economic
Development.
   The state stepped in and poured millions of dollars into
development of a major port at Saint Paul Island, one of two in the
Pribilofs, for the thriving Bering Sea fishery, Merculieff noted.
   But that could have other consequences.
   ``Saint Paul soon will be opening its fishing port,'' he said.
``We will then have 2,000 transients on an island that is five
miles wide, 12 miles long, with a million seals, three million
birds and 700 Aleuts. The people being brought in are not sensitive
to village life or wildlife. The disruption won't be confined to
the environment, but to our social and cultural structure as well.''
   The state commerce chief is not optimistic about the native
marketing plan:
   ``It might work for five years or so, but in the long run, the
fur markets of the world are going to be completely destroyed by
the animal rights movement.''
   The effect on native cultures ``to me,'' Merculieff said, ``is
tantamount to genocide. But nobody seems to be listening.''
