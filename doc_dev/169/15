   A constant parade of Titanic-sized
icebergs slowly drifts with the currents of Disko Bay in sight of
this west coast fishing port.
   Spawned by the Northern Hemisphere's most productive glacier 25
miles to the south, these mountains of ice break off with a
thunderous roar and begin their silent arctic voyage.
   The barking of sled dogs, which outnumber the 4,000 people of
the town, mixes with the chugging of cutters and shrimp boats and
the hum of the fish factories in the tiny harbor.
   Against the darkened sky, the Northern Lights unfurl in wavy
sheets of red and green across the horizon.
   Ilulissat, which means icebergs in the native language, is
inhabited by Inuits who are culturally and linguistically related
to the Eskimos of Alaska and others in Canada and Siberia.
   Nearly everyone in the town, 180 miles north of the Arctic
Circle, make their living from the sea.
   Its economy is totally dependent on shrimp and halibut catches,
which the local fishermen deliver directly to the two big state-run
fish factories, employing 350 people in the peak season.
   Ilulissat, Greenland's third-largest town, also is known by its
Danish name, Jacobshavn. Denmark, which ruled Greenland for 200
years, made it an autonomous territory under the Danish crown 10
years ago.
   About 50 fishing boats, ranging from factory trawlers to one-man
cutters, operate during the summer from Ilulissat's natural harbor.
   In the winters of 24-hour darkness, many fishermen such as
Soeren Madsen go ``longlining'' on the Icefjord, a frozen fiord at
the foot of the glacier.
   ``We drive 35 miles overland across rough terrain in dogsleds to
the fishing grounds, and the temperature can fall to minus 22
degrees Fahrenheit out on the ice,'' Madsen says.
   Long lines strung with up to 100 hooks are sunk through holes
cut in the ice and then hauled up by hand from the depths.
   ``You have to return with a catch of at least 400 pounds to make
it pay,'' Madsen says.
   A typical fishing tour on the ice lasts 48 hours, during which
time the men live in low, conical tents with a Primus stove to keep
warm.
   The dog teams of 10 to 12 huskies sleep huddled together out in
the open. They are capable of running 12 hours non-stop.
   Some of the fishermen make a little extra money on the side
driving sleds for winter tourists who come to see the natural
wonders of the Disko Bay area.
   In Ilulissat, it's an unwritten law that dog sleds have the
right of way.
   Ilulissat municipality includes four small outlying settlements
of 80 to 100 inhabitants each. Beyond those tiny villages lie
nothing but the glacial ice pack, 2{ miles thick, of Greenland's
interior.
   No roads link the town with its satellite settlements. Travel is
by boat, sled or helicopter.
   The Greenlandic dog, a special breed protected by a ban on
imports of other races, is not tame, and visitors are advised not
to pet them.
   Practically every dwelling in the town has a dog team in the
yard where fish for their fodder is hung up in racks to dry.
   The dogs must be kept chained, their fangs cut. Stray dogs are
shot on orders from the authorities.
   Many hunters are embittered over an anti-sealing campaign waged
by conservationists that ruined the once-lucrative skin trade.
   In the early 1980s, environmental groups such as Greenpeace,
spurred on by French actress and self-styled animal friend Brigitte
Bardot, launched highly publicized protests against the Canadian
practice of bludgeoning seal pups to death for their prized white
pelts.
   Gruesome pictures of the Canadian seal hunt became associated in
the public mind with the Greenlanders' traditional hunt, which does
not include pups.
   Seal pups are born on the ice floes off northern Canada and are
rarely seen in Greenlandic waters.
   Prices for Greenlandic skins plunged in Europe, and the United
States, a major market, banned the import of seal skins.
   ``Greenpeace eventually apologized to Greenland, but they should
have admitted their mistake to the consumers as well,'' said Adolf
Jensen, a hunter who comes from a tiny settlement 62 miles north of
Ilulissat.
