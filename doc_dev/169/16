LIVING ARCTIC: Hunters of the Canadian North by Hugh Brody (University of 
Washington Press: $14.95, illustrated). Brody's thoughtful essays on the 
history, culture and languages of the Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples of Canada 
contrast the let's-rub-noses stereotypes with the true nature of these caring, 
anti-authoritarian cultures.

The respectful relationship that the Inuit maintained with their seemingly 
hostile environment ensured the survival of the people and the animals that 
supplied their food. (Recent studies have shown that their exclusive diet of 
meat and fat supplied all the nutrients necessary for human health: Diabetes 
and other metabolic diseases were unknown among the Inuit until "Southerners" 
introduced them to flour, sugar and alcohol.) The concluding discussion of 
politics documents the growing movement among the Native Peoples to preserve 
their traditional values, despite the increasing commercial exploitation of the 
Arctic and its mineral resources. Charles Solomon
