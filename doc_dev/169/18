   An international expedition plans to walk 483 miles
across the ice to the North Pole in an effort to dramatize the
hazards they believe are threatening the arctic.
   The team, which includes members from Canada, the United States,
the Soviet Union, Britain, Japan, Australia and West Germany, hopes
to set out on the 65-day trip around March 10-15 from Cape Columbia,
Canada's northernmost point of land on the Arctic Ocean.
   The American in the group is Darryl Roberts of the Bronx, N.Y.
   ``Everyone has to understand that this is no walk in the park,''
said Peter Baird, the Canadian liaison for the Icewalk expedition.
``This is a life-threatening project.''
   The expedition is led by Robert Swan, the British explorer who
walked to the South Pole with two other men in 1986. A successful
completion of the northern trip would make him the first on record
to walk to both poles.
   Baird is an administrator and will not be among the eight-member
team that walks to the North Pole. His Ottawa company, the Conexus
Research Group, served as the managers for the Canadian-Soviet ski
expedition that crossed the arctic ice cap last year to widespread
acclaim.
   Baird had no easy explanation for why adventurers seem to keep
trying to come up with new projects and goals in the arctic.
   ``Who knows what motivates them?'' he said. ``It's an athletic
thing, clearly, in some ways. It's the right to say you're first. .
.. And some sort of declaration that the human spirit is still alive
and kicking.''
   At around the time the Icewalk begins, another expedition will
have already started, if all goes on schedule, on a dog-sled trek
across the frozen Bering Strait separating Alaska and Soviet
Siberia. The purpose of the trek by a U.S.-Soviet team of 10 men and
two women is to call attention to the common cultural heritage of
the indigenous people living on both sides of the strait. The
two-month expedition is scheduled to depart from Anadyr, Siberia, on
March 1.
   The $4 million Icewalk to the North Pole has lined up Amway, the
Michigan-based marketing company, as its major corporate sponsor.
   The Icewalk is different from other similar ventures in that it
will use only human power. Supplies will be brought along in sledges
that require tremendous energy to haul their 250-300 pound cargoes.
The group will use skis, but there will be no dogsleds or
skimobiles. The team will be flown back after reaching its goal.
   It also hopes to attract attention by bringing an international
group of about 30 teen-age students to a base camp at Eureka on
Ellesmere Island to help with radio monitoring and to promote the
anti-pollution message.
   Team members will gather snow and atmospheric samples to record
pollution levels in the region. They will be testing for mercury _
said to be the first such tests in the region _ as well as tracking
sulphates, nitrates, chlorides and graphite particles. They also
will collect pollen samples to help find the origin of pollutants.
   Canadian research over the past four years has turned up dozens
of toxic substances in the region's fragile ecosystem, many of them
entering the food chain. Attention also has focused on the thinning
of the world's ozone layer, most notably at the world's poles, and
on acid rain.
   Baird said the team will spend about a month training at a base
camp before venturing out on the ice from Cape Columbia on the
65-day trip.
   ``There's only a certain window when you can do this,'' he added.
   Waiting warmer weather means too much open sea and drifting ice;
taking off too soon means too much harsh weather and temperatures
that are too cold.
   ``They can count on rough, rough ice _ sea ice _ for the first
100 kilometers (62 miles),'' Baird said. ``It's a maze; it's like a
giant jigsaw puzzle.''
   The temperatures could be as low as 70 degrees below zero
(Fahrenheit) at the outset, while winds could be as strong as about
55 miles an hour. The plans call for daily consumption of more than
6,000 calories by each member of the team to keep up energy.
   The Canadian on the team is Angus Clarence ``Kaanerk'' Cockney,
who is an Inuit, as Eskimos are called in Canada. He was born and
reared in Canada's Northwest Territories.
