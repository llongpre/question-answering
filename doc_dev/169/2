<LEADPARA>  The likely creation of a huge new Arctic territory for Eskimos marks a
watershed in Canada's efforts to address the many longstanding grievances of
its native peoples.;   But the prospect of the new realm has pitted Canada's
various aboriginal peoples against each other, as they argue over how best to
achieve their ultimate goal: self-government.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Stephen Hazell, executive director of the Canadian Arctic Resources
Committee, called the agreement a "shining star," and said Tuesday that it was
"one of the better achievements of the federal government.";   But A.J. Felix,
head of the Prince Albert Tribal Council, an Indian group, called it "a very
black day," and worried that "the government of Canada could unilaterally deny
the rights of one group of people by claiming to recognize the rights of
another group of people." He said the Tribal Council planned to go to court
before Christmas to block the deal for the Eskimos.;   The prospect of new
lands for the Inuit, as Canadian Eskimos prefer to be called, loomed large
this week, when the Canadian government and an Inuit negotiating team
announced Monday that they had reached a huge land-claims settlement after 16
years of talks.;   If all goes as planned, Canada will split its existing
Northwest Territories in two, and create an Inuit territory called Nunavut,
which means "Our Land" in Inuktitut, the language of the eastern Arctic.;  
Nunavut would be enormous -- 772,000 square miles -- bigger than Alaska and
California combined, covering a fifth of Canada's total landmass. The 17,000
Inuit who live in its frozen, barren wastes would eventually govern
themselves.;   The settlement calls for the Inuit to own 136,000 square miles
of Nunavut outright, and to extinguish their claims to the rest of the land,
while retaining fishing and hunting rights throughout the territory. They
would also receive nearly $1 billion over 14 years, including more than $10
million in training funds, so they will be able to administer their own
territorial government.;   But Nunavut is not a done deal. "There's still
quite a lot of uncertainty" surrounding the accord, said Jim Bell, a writer
with the Nunatsiaq News, the newspaper in Iqaluit, a town of 3,200 at the
southern tip of Baffin Island that would probably become the territorial
capital if Nunavut becomes a reality.;   A major stumbling point is the
objection of Indians in the Western Arctic to Nunavut's proposed boundaries.
The Indians and Inuit have hunted and trapped across overlapping regions of
Northern Canada for millenniums; Indians say some lands designated for Nunavut
are theirs.;   The Inuit and the Indians will be able to vote on the
boundaries in a Northwest Territories plebiscite scheduled for March 16.
Observers say the vote could be close.;   "I think it will be a rough ride,
because the Dene and the Metis don't agree with the boundaries that are being
imposed," said Jack Anawak, Canada's only Eskimo member of Parliament. The
Dene nation is made up of half a dozen Indian tribes in the Western Arctic and
sub-Arctic; Metis are peoples of mixed Indian and white lineage.;   "If the
plebiscite on the boundary fails," Bell said, "then the whole thing could fall
apart."  </TEXT>
