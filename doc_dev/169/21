About 27,000 voters in Canada's Northwest Territories have narrowly approved
the setting up from 1999 of the region of Nunavut, a vast area including
most of the eastern Arctic, Robert Gribbens reports from Montreal. It is
seen as the first step toward creating a homeland for the Inuit.
Most of the inhabited Arctic islands are included in Nunavut, but the
Beaufort Sea remains in the western NWT.
Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, is returning to the constitutional
negotiating table with a four-day visit to western Canada and direct talks
with the four western premiers.
He wants to put a federal constitutional offer before Quebec voters this
autumn, rather than hold a referendum on Quebec's sovereignty.
He is now trying to ensure the offer will be at least as generous to Quebec
as Ottawa's Meech Lake proposals, which failed to get unanimous provincial
consent in 1990.
