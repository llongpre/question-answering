Greenland, a former Danish colony 10 years into home rule, is a forbidding
land of immense ice packs, serious social problems and chronic unemployment.
It has the world's highest suicide rate. But now this bad luck island may
have received a pre-Christmas present no one expected: GOLD.    ___</HEAD>

   Just when things were looking bleakest in
this ice-bound island of 53,000 people and 1,800 oxen, nature came
to the rescue.
   Until a few months ago, this is how things looked:
   The U.S. Air Force was closing Greenland's only international
airport and the four radar stations it supplied.
   A Canadian-owned lead and zinc mine was closing, and off-shore
oil exploration so far has proved fruitless.
   There was chronic unemployment _ except when the fish are
running. Alcoholism and venereal disease were rampant and every
year 50 Greenlanders kill themselves. It's the world's highest
suicide rate, 129 per 100,000, more than double No. 2 Hungary's 45
per 100,000.
   All of those things still stand, but in November Danish and
Canadian geologists announced they had found gold, a
1.6-square-mile patch on the country's east coast, comparable in
size to South African gold reserves.
   A Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, reported that mining could
begin in 5 years and could yield 12 tons of gold a year, which at
current prices comes to something like $150 million.
   That should come as good news to Denmark, which last year
provided semi-autonomous Greenland with $347 million, or 86 percent
of the island's budget.
   It would also pay the $30 million a year it takes to keep open
the Sondre Stromfjord airfield where a sign proclaims ``United
States Air Force Space Command.''
   There's nothing Space Age about the primeval-looking musk oxen
roaming the nearby arctic hinterland. But, provided by the
Americans, they are the only thing that flourishes around here.
   The oxen, today 1,800 strong, are the offspring of a few hundred
shaggy beasts flown here in U.S. transport planes four years ago
and set loose as a gesture of good will.
   The airfield, nestled between a jade-green fiord and the foot of
a glacier, is Greenland's only international airport, a hub of
civilian flights.
   This year the former Danish colony celebrates 10 years of
semi-independence under a home-rule system, with its own parliament
and two legislators sitting in the Danish parliament in Copenhagen.
   Some income is generated by 300 U.S. servicemen and about 2,000
Danish civilians, who pay income tax, working at the controversial
Thule radar base in the far north.
   The U.S. military has volunteered other aid besides running the
airport, which services Nuuk, Greenland's capital, 198 miles to the
south. Recently the Army Corps of Engineers offered to help with
public works projects in remote settlements.
   The gold find, which the Greenlanders will split 50-50 with
Denmark, will augment the few exploitable resources of the world's
largest island, notably fish and shrimp. There are other problems
just as formidable, such as the suicides.
   ``Alcohol is always involved, along with problems with the
girlfriend,'' says Rene Christensen, the chief physician for the
Nuuk district.
   Women had a total of 870 abortions last year, against 1,100
births.
   ``Venereal disease is 100 times higher than in Denmark,''
Christensen says.
   The economy is drained by the expensive social welfare programs
inherited from Denmark. The city of Nuuk, Greenland's largest with
13,000 people, pays $14 million a year for benefits such as
subsidized housing, kindergartens and day care centers and
unemployment. Free health service is provided by the Danes.
   The job situation, never good, was worsened by the international
campaign against seal and whale hunting, one of the main sources of
income for the Inuit people, whose life is centered on hunting and
fishing.
   ``It became shameful to be seen in a sealskin coat,'' complains
Adolf Jensen, a hunter from a small village 250 miles north of the
Arctic Circle.
   ``Today Greenlanders can't live by hunting alone, though hunter
families can supplement their incomes by using skins for clothing
and eating the meat.''
   The end of professional seal hunting has led to an uncontrolled
growth in seal herds, which has been blamed by some experts for the
sudden depletion of cod stocks several years ago.
   Greenland is a glacial land of primitive and permanent white
beauty, where dogsleds, coastal steamers and helicopters are the
main means of travel outside the towns.
   Ninety percent of Greenlanders live on the west coast of the
island, which is three-fourths the size of Australia.
