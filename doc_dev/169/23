<LEADPARA>  I'LL never forget my first "Kabloona.";    It was more than 20 years ago, the
day I arrived on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, that a close friend
pressed a been-around copy of that curiously titled book into my dubious hands
and simply said, "Read this." He knew, as I was soon to find out, how
superfluous it would have been to say more about this delightful story, so
unique in its sensibility and so refreshing in its point of view.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     First published in 1941, "Kabloona" describes the 15-month, 20,000-mile
journey that its author, Frenchman Gontran de Poncins, made to the Eskimo
lands near the North Pole. A vicomte and descendant of French essayist Michel
Eyquem de Montaigne, Poncins had become disenchanted with "the selfishness of
our world, the ungenerosity of man to man," and had taken to wandering in
places like China, India and the South Seas to see if he could discover any
alternative, according to notes that collaborator Lewis Galantiere wrote for
the Book-of-the-Month Club edition.;    Search for contentment;  "Surely of
all things in the world the rarest is a civilized man at peace with himself,"
de Poncins writes with typical candor in the preface to "Kabloona," and his
trip to the far north was an attempt to see if that barren area could in some
way provide the contentment he sought.;    Certainly de Poncins' odyssey
didn't begin as he'd envisioned; he found the first Eskimos he met to be
"actually sordid, physically repugnant, and possessed by a nature in which I
could see none of the generous hospitality of primitive peoples elsewhere." So
while the book is nominally about an arduous physical journey, it's really
about an even more strenuous psychological and spiritual one, about how this
cultivated Frenchman came to see that it was not the Eskimo but he himself who
was the uncultured savage.;    Nowhere is de Poncins' change of heart and mind
more evident than in the drolly self-deprecating title he chose for the book.
For "Kabloona" is the Eskimo term for white man, and it is not what you'd call
a complimentary one. To the Eskimo mind, to be a Kabloona is to be the
sorriest fool the Earth has ever seen, a figure of fun, not to say contempt.; 
  If the Kabloona was at the bottom of the human scale, the Eskimo, who called
himself Inuit, "a man, preeminently," was at the top, and de Poncins
increasingly comes to share that people's perception of itself. Astonished at
their expertise at hunting, tracking, trekking, igloo building and overall
survival, he is even more taken with their gentle disposition in this, the
harshest of lands:;    "These Eskimos afford me decisive proof that happiness
is a disposition of the spirit. Here was a people living in the most rigorous
climate in the world, in the most depressing surroundings imaginable, haunted
by famine in a gray and somber landscape sullen with the absence of life. . .
. They ought to have been melancholy men, men despondent and suicidal;
instead, they were a cheerful people, always laughing, never weary of
laughter. A man is happy, in sum, when he is leading the life that suits
him.";    Though de Poncins has his share of memorable adventures, including
nearly dying in a blizzard, his most exciting accomplishment is his
penetration of the Eskimo mind, the way he is able to make a completely alien
system of thought comprehensible both to himself and to us.;    Most basically
of all, de Poncins develops an understanding of the Eskimos' communal way of
life, which turns out to be the reason they immediately helped themselves to
all his provisions, an act that he had initially assumed, in typical Kabloona
fashion, was motivated by pure greed.;    "The important thing was
hospitality, ownership was nothing," he realized. "Human life in the Arctic
would vanish without this solidarity among men. It is the community that
remains alive here, not the men.";    Brotherhood a commonplace;  Finally,
then, it is the kind of person de Poncins shows himself to be that makes
"Kabloona" a unique adventure. Almost majestic in his ability to see himself
as truly the fool, de Poncins wrote a wise book that is both disarming and
enchanting in its humorous insights and poetic honesty. His search for
tranquillity, he knew, had not been in vain: "In this Arctic have I found my
peace, the peace I was never able to find outside. . . . Outside it wanted war
and flood to give man this sense of brotherhood: Here it was a commonplace of
life.";    To read this memoir (available in paperback from Carroll &amp; Graf) is
to at once envy the Eskimo their encounter with this singular Kabloona and to
be grateful that at the very least he left this record, fresh as the instant
he wrote it, for us to savor and pass on.  </TEXT>
