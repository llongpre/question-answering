<LEADPARA>  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney proposed changes to the constitution today that
would recognize Quebec as a "distinct society," provide for an elected Senate
and allow Indians and Inuit self-government.;   The purpose of the
constitutional overhaul is "to build a stronger, more prosperous Canada where
all Canadians can feel at home," the Conservative prime minister told the
House of Commons.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "These changes add up to a renewal that is long overdue. And renewal is
what Canadians everywhere seek for our country -- not confrontation, not
division, not rupture.";   The "distinct society" proposal is likely to be the
most controversial. A similar idea is what sank an effort at constitutional
reform 15 months ago. That package, known as the Meech Lake accords, failed to
win the necessary unanimous ratification of all 10 Canadian provinces.;  
Quebec viewed the failure of Meech Lake as a rejection by English Canada and
the provincial government went ahead with measures calling for a referendum on
sovereignty by October 1992 if a new deal isn't forthcoming.;   Mulroney's
proposal includes a distinct society provision in both the Charter of Rights
and Freedoms, Canada's Bill of Rights, and a new "Canada clause" to the
constitution which defines what makes Canada what it is.;   "I am sure
Quebecers will see in today's proposal the possibility of achieving the
fundamental reform that Quebec needs to evolve as a distinct society within
Canada," Mulroney said.;   French-speaking Quebec, home to nearly 7 million of
Canada's 26 million people, long has felt under linguistic and cultural siege
by the English Canadians on all sides.;   Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe
Clark has said that "distinct society" only recognizes constitutionally what
has been the reality since before confederation in 1867.;   The Quebec
provincial government of Premier Robert Bourassa has said it would have no
immediate reaction to the proposals.;   Liberal Leader Jean Chretien, in his
speech to the Commons, welcomed the principles for reform outlined by
Mulroney, but stopped short of endorsing the package. "Indeed, our first
impression is that the proposals of the government need a great deal of work,"
Chretien said.;   Outside the House chamber, Chretien said the Liberals "will
study the proposition. We will make some suggestions.";   Audrey McLaughlin,
leader of the New Democratic Party, was distressed that the proposals "made no
mention of the need to entrench social rights" in the constitution.;   The
Mulroney government has asked opposition parties to give the measures a chance
and not reject them immediately.;   The package of proposals will be turned
over to a joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate which will tour
the country seeking public comment. Its report is due by Feb. 28.;   The
measures are expected to change the 1982 constitution, which Quebec never
signed but is bound by.;   The proposals provide for an elected Senate, which
is now appointed by the government. Provincial representation would be decided
later. The elected Senate would have a limited veto power over legislation.;  
Mulroney said there is a new commitment to Canada's 500,000 Indians and Inuit
-- or Eskimos -- to give them self-government within 10 years.;   Ottawa is
seeking more power in the proposals to tear down barriers to interprovincial
trade.  </TEXT>
