   Arctic Eskimos from Alaska in the
west to Siberia in the east met in Greenland on Monday to discuss
common cultural and ecological problems.
   It was the first time a Soviet delegation attended a general
assembly of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, a non-governmental
umbrella organization for Inuit, or Eskimos, from Alaska, Canada,
Greenland and Soviet Union.
   About 450 Inuit were expected take part in the west Greenland
township of Sisimuit.
   A 10-man delegation, which is attending as an observer, says it
represents native Siberians known as Yuit.
   ``Even though President Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika has
reached areas of the Soviet Union where the 1,600 Yuit live, there
are many problems we would like to discuss with the ICC,''
delegation leader Nadesjda Utke said during a stopover in
Copenhagen.
   ``We want to exchange experiences in maintaining traditional
hunting and implements, educational materials and greater
participation by the local people in decision-making,'' she said.
   The fifth general assembly was being held under the motto ``A
Celebration of Inuit Unity,'' to mark the first Soviet
participation. It was opened by the current Conference President,
Mary Simon of Canada.
   Topics for discussion during the five-day gathering included
environment and renewable resources, promotion of Inuit rights
internationally and transboundry pollution of the Arctic.
   A series of workshops were set up to study and report back on
such specialized topics as Arctic peace and security, whaling, the
``anti-harvesting'' conservation movement's impact on traditional
hunting, Inuit culture, land use and costal zone management.
   About 40,000 Inuit live in Greenland, 28,000 in Alaska and
11,000 in Canada. The Soviet Inuits comprise a small part of the
150,000 natives of the Siberian north.
   Greenland, the world's biggest island and a former colony of
Denmark, this summer celebrates its tenth year with homerule-style
local government.
