<LEADPARA>  Armed with his World War I-vintage Lee-Enfield rifle and a toll-free telephone
number to call if he spots a Soviet or U.S. submarine breaking through the ice
of the Beaufort Sea, Canadian Ranger Paul Raddi, 30, is in the first line of
defense of Canada's sovereignty over the 2.4 million-square-mile Arctic
archipelago.;    Raddi is one of 12 Eskimo home guard Rangers on Banks Island,
and among 120 spread across the archipelago through which runs the Northwest
Passage.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     With only a handful of Canadian army soldiers stationed above the Arctic
Circle, the Eskimo Rangers represent, in effect, a political statement by the
Canadian government that the Northwest Passage is sovereign Canadian territory
and not part of international waters, as contended by the United States and
most other countries.;    With their help, the Rangers, a supplementary
reserve force that has been in existence since World War I, has been vastly
expanded in the last year.  </TEXT>
