   In a landmark decision
Tuesday, a judge found four Eskimos innocent of charges of public
mischief arising from protests of low-level NATO flights over their
traditional hunting grounds.
   ``I am satisfied that the four believe their ancestors predate
any Canadian claims to ancestry on this land,'' Judge James
Igloliorte told a makeshift courtroom set up in the community hall
of this Labrador village.
   ``Through their knowledge of ancestry and kinship, they have
shown that none of their people ever gave away rights to the land
to Canada.''
   Daniel Ashini, chief of the local Innu band of Eskimos; Ben
Michel, a band council member; Elizabeth Penashue; and her son,
Peter Penashue _ were accused of entering the runway area at the
Goose Bay air base in September to protest the flights by Canada,
West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands.
   The provincial court judge, himself an Innu, accepted defense
arguments that the four held an ``honest belief'' that the land on
which the airbase is located belongs to the Eskimos, and therefore
they committed no wrong.
   The judge urged a political settlement to the dispute between
the Ottawa government and the Eskimos over the NATO flights and
simulated bombing runs the natives say have made a battleground of
the territory they claim as a homeland.
   Igloliorte said the government ``must negotiate answers to their
problems since the court is unable to answer these problems for
them.''
   Native leaders hailed the ruling as a victory. The government
gave no indication on whether it would appeal the decision.
   After the verdict, the four accused jumped to their feet and
clapped, as did the 150 Eskimo men, women and children who attended
the three-day trial earlier this month.
   The ruling ``calls on Canada to enter into a new era of
relations with the Innu (Eskimo)'' said a beaming Ashini. ``The era
of extinction of rights through an unjust land claims process is
over.''
   James O'Reilly, a native affairs lawyer, termed the judgment a
significant victory for the native people of Canada.
   ``The fact that (the judge) would recognize traditional rights
as being sufficient to override arguments of national defense is
certainly a first, as far as I can see,'' he said in an interview
from Montreal.
