A joint U.S. and Soviet national park and wilderness preserve is being planned 
for the land on both sides of the Bering Straits, where Siberia and Alaska are 
only 80 miles apart. It has already been dubbed the "Glasnost and Glaciers" 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Ecologists and park officials in both countries have agreed that the region is 
best treated as an ecological whole, and that joint management of the area is 
the best way to protect the wildlife and the wilderness and to guard against 
pollution, including oil spills, in this fragile environment, where winter ends 
in early May and resumes at the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
This human attempt to see the region as a whole echoes the geological past, 
when the Asian and American continents were joined by a land bridge across the 
Bering Straits, across which America's first human inhabitants are believed to 
have migrated. 
</P>
<P>
Although the boundaries for the park have yet to be drawn up, and plans for 
tourist access and management rules are in the early stages, enthusiastic 
scientists from both countries are planning joint research programs into 
migration patterns and breeding zones. 
</P>
<P>
The only access to this region is by dog sled, boat, four-wheel drive, 
helicopter or float plane. But in spite of the remoteness, reminders of the 
modern world are near enough, in the U.S. military base and radar station at 
Nome, and in the matching array of Soviet security installations in Magadan 
Province. 
</P>

'A Single Ecosystem' 
</P>
<P>
"The Bering Sea happens to be divided by a political boundary, but it should be 
recognized and managed as a single ecosystem," said Curtis Bohlen, a vice 
president of the World Wildlife Fund, and one of the promoters of the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contribution to the venture is expected to be a large part of the Nome 
Peninsula known as the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. The Soviet Union 
has a series of ecologically protected zones, rather than a formal national 
park service, but Soviet ecologists have lately been examining the U.S. and the 
British national park systems to see which best suits their conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent spur to this cooperation on the roof of the world was the 
Alaska oil spill disaster, when a purpose-built oil-skimming Russian ship was 
sent to help clear up the 11 million gallons of crude oil that gushed from the 
Exxon Valdez supertanker. 
</P>
<P>
With further oil exploration already going on off Alaska's Barrow Peninsula, 
and with the Soviets starting to drill in their own Arctic coastal zones, 
concern about more oil pollution has intensified the contacts between U.S. and 
Soviet ecologists. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea of an Arctic park was first raised in the 1960s, U.S.-Soviet 
cooperation in this neighborly Arctic region has progressed with remarkable 
speed since the coming of glasnost. Earlier this year, U.S. and Soviet 
officials agreed that the Inuit natives of both sides would be allowed to come 
and go without bothering with the tedious formalities of bureaucratic 
civilization such as visas. An Alaskan airline now flies a regular service back 
and forth to the Siberian town of Providenya. 
</P>
<P>
And in this Alaska territory, which was a province of the Czar's Empire until 
it was sold for hard cash in the 1860s, Soviet architectural historians have 
begun helping with the restoration of old Russian Orthodox churches.
