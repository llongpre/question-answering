A TRUE democrat, Michael Green, Controller of Radio 4, submitted himself on
Sunday to half an hour's telephoned comment on his network. The lines had
already been open for two hours, so no doubt the comments we heard were only
a few of those made. How else account for a mere two criticisms of the
morning-timed Woman's Hour? One of them complained simply of inability to
hear it at its new time, or even at the evening repeat at 7.20 pm to be
tried for six months. The other reckoned that the programme had begun to
deal with women's general, ie feminist, rather than domestic, interests.
The most important complaint made was surely the inability to receive FM
signals in some areas. Things would be better during the 1990s, Mr Green
promised. Or perhaps we must wait half a decade for DAB, or digital audio
broadcasting. Most of the other complaints were matters of taste. Reporters'
voices in the news bulletins were too 'magazine-y', there were too many old
comedy items like quizzes, there was too much nostalgia, there should be
more listener-involvement (like phone-ins), there was too much background
music in the plays, there were too many repeats, too much obsession with
politics.
The Controller kept his end up well enough and promised to take notes of
what was raised. Hardly had he ended than a violin began the background
music for the repeat of Planche's play The Garrick Fever, a delightful
comedy about an ambitious young Irishman playing Hamlet in place of the
absent star (there was no more music, though). Then followed the first of a
political series, The Power and the Glory, in which James Naughtie examines
American leadership. Two excellent programmes.
Nostalgia followed almost at once, in a series on the Gulf fighting, The
Desert War, and in Concerto, a reminiscent interview with Moura Lympany; but
I doubt if the objection was meant to include all such memories. For serious
nostalgia we had to wait for the first programme in Never the Same Again on
Tuesday (a repeat), and the second programme on Thursday morning. The series
deals with 'critical periods in family life', and the general sentiment is
self-pity. I find this an unattractive sentiment, however accountable,
especially when flaunted as a sort of entertainment.
With respect to Mr Green, I find the best drama on Radio 3 as a rule, but
this week they repeated two plays about which I have already written fairly
lately. On Sunday we had the interesting Much Ado about Nothing directed by
Clive Brill, with its cultural range of voices - Afro-Caribbean sounds for
the Fairies and RADA sounds for the Greeks, well worth its second hearing.
On Tuesday came a repeat of Anthony Burgess's A Meeting in Valladolid, a
fantasy about a meeting between Shakespeare and Cervantes, which has already
been broadcast all over Europe in 13 languages, and I would have thought
that enough.
By way of total contrast, Radio 4 gave us Chris Galer's Manikudlak and the
Bear on Thursday, part of the channel's current Northern Lights Festival.
Set in Greenland, this was about an Inuit (Meredith Edwards) and his young
nephew (Marc Heatley), who go hunting together. Manikudlak hears voices, of
the Sea-mother who lives at the bottom of the sea waiting for men to come
and comb her hair, and of the days of his youth. The boy is not interested
in such old stories and goes home on his own after a bear has been sighted
but Manikudlak has jammed his rifle. The bear is in fact a revival of the
bear that Manikudlak and his brother had killed years before, and in whose
gutted body he had sheltered from an ice-storm. Now the brothers are
reunited. The play mixes fact and folk-tale throughout in this pleasant if
not always expert way. The director was Jane Dauncey.
There were more Inuits elsewhere in the week, with more to come, dealing
with the cultures of the peoples living on the Arctic rim - all pretty new
to most of us, I suspect.
