   The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge
to the rates being charged for transporting oil through the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a rate agreement
between Alaska and the pipeline's eight owners.
   The rates were challenged by the Arctic Slope Regional Corp.,
established under Alaska law to protect the rights of Inupiat
Eskimos.
   Lawyers for Arctic said the pipeline rate agreement, which
extends through the year 2011, ``will have a critical effect on the
development and cost of oil from the Alaska North Slope, an energy
resource vital to our nation's economy and security.''
   After large reserves of oil were discovered on Alaska's North
Slope in 1969, eight oil companies constructed an 800-mile pipeline
to the all-weather port of Valdez on the state's Pacific coast.
   The pipeline was completed in 1977, at a cost of some $9 billion.
   The Alaska law, aimed at promoting oil production, extinguished
the land claims of native Alaskans by compensating them with money.
   Arctic is one of 13 regional corporations given ownership of
lands formerly held by natives. Arctic leases much of its 4.5
million acres for the benefit of its Inupiat Eskimo shareholders.
   Oil from Arctic's lands likely will start being shipped through
the pipeline sometime in the 1990s, and the oil's value to Arctic
will be reduced dollar-for-dollar by charges levied for
transporting it.
   After nine years of administrative proceedings, Alaska and the
pipeline's eight owners reached a rate agreement in 1986.
   Arctic attempted to challenge the agreement, contending that the
per-barrel rates it yielded are too high.
   But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the
agreement as uncontested after ruling that Arctic was not
``particularly aggrieved'' by the pipeline rates.
   A federal appeals court here upheld the commission ruling last
Oct. 27 after noting that the rate agreement is not binding on
Arctic, and that Arctic is free to challenge the rates once oil
from its lands begin to pass through the pipeline.
   ``Arctic can properly be left out in the cold for the moment,''
the appeals court ruled, adding, ``The commission acted within its
lawful authority and discretion in closing a long and wearisome
chapter in the saga of (Trans-Alaska Pipeline) rate regulation.''
   The pipeline's owners are Amerada Hess, Arco, BP, Exxon, Mobil,
Phillips, Sohio and Unocal.
   The case is Arctic Slope Regional Corp. vs. FERC, 87-1869.
