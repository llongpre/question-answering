   ``Despite ANCSA and its millions, native people who had little
money before 1971 have little money today,'' said Thomas Berger, a
former British Columbia Supreme Court judge who spent two years
interviewing villagers across Alaska for the Inuit Circumpolar
Conference.
   Unemployment remains high in Alaska's villages. Alcoholism is
widespread, as liquor fuels the depression of a younger generation
skilled in neither the old subsistence traditions nor the modern
ways of a technological society. Alaska's young native men, aged 14
to 24, kill themselves at a rate four times the national average, a
recent study found.
   Disappointment in the corporate experiment turned to outrage
when it became obvious it could eventually lead to the loss of
native lands. ANCSA banned the sale of stock to non-natives until
1991, but natives realized their corporations would be diluted and
their land could slip from their grasp after that.
   The Yupiit Nation was born in this atmosphere of fear. In the
summer of 1984, Kasayulie and about 40 other native leaders drew up
a declaration of independence from outside forces.
   ``Our people have been in control for so many thousands of
years, determining their own destiny. With the advance of Western
society, the rules changed,'' he said.
   Native sovereignty is a way to change the rules back again, he
said.
   For example, Akiachak's panel of elders may confiscate a man's
riverboat if they find him guilty of disturbing the peace. If he
needs it for fishing to feed his family, they're likely to return
it, Kasayulie said.
   Tribal council meetings are conducted in Yupik, the language of
choice for most villagers, and great deference is paid to the
elders, Kasayulie said.
   Akiachak's brightest teen-agers can stay in the village these
days, attending a modern high school that features both computer
labs and lessons on building dog sleds.
   But Akiachak's tribal government is still underground as far as
state officials are concerned. The state won't budge on most tribal
issues, partly because sovereignty would discriminate against
whites living in predominantly native villages, said Douglas Mertz,
an assistant state attorney general.
   ``Non-natives would not have the right to participate in the
government,'' he said. ``They wouldn't have effective recourse if
their civil rights were violated. In fact, they could be booted out
of the community, even if they owned property and had lived there
all their lives.''
   State officials also worry that if each of Alaska's 200 native
villages sets up a separate jurisdiction, the result would be a
jumble of tax, environmental, and hunting and fishing regulations.
   Mertz is juggling a half-dozen cases involving tribal
sovereignty, and he expects to see more.
   That's because the courts have inherited the question from
Congress, which last winter amended the Claims Settlement Act. The
amendments continued the restrictions on stock ownership
indefinitely, relieving some of the natives' concerns, but
lawmakers rejected pleas to include language bolstering sovereignty
claims.
   So far, the courts have sent mixed signals concerning
sovereignty.
   Tribal advocates applauded the federal district court's 1986
decision upholding Tyonek's immunity.
   But the sovereignty movement was dealt a blow in May, when the
Alaska Supreme Court said Tyonek was an exception because it
occupied a reservation, later dissolved, in the 1930s. The court
said other Alaska villages are ineligible to claim sovereign
immunity because Congress never treated them as reservations or
tribes.
   Mertz said it would take more than one court case to untangle
the legal thicket surrounding native sovereignty. ``The one thing
about Indian law is that there are no certainties, and Indian law
in Alaska is even more that way,'' he said.
   Akiachak is not waiting for final word from the courts. Perhaps
the best argument for tribal sovereignty, Kasayulie said, is that
it works.
   ``If there's to be any dispute from the state or federal
government, let them prove that our tribal governments aren't
functioning,'' he said.
   ``I think they should make a comparison between tribal
government and city government to find out who is more responsible
to the villagers. I think they'd find the tribal government is
operating better than the city, even though we're operating with
less money.''
