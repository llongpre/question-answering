<P>
Leaning on a cane, Canadian firebrand Mordecai Richler hobbled into the lobby 
of Montreal's posh Ritz-Carlton Hotel. The 59-year-old writer had taken a spill 
on the ice outside of his country home on Lac Memphremagog, a resort lake 
straddling the U.S. border in Quebec's Eastern Townships. 
</P>
<P>
"These winters are punishing," acknowledged the bruised but otherwise 
unflappable Montreal native, whose first novel in a decade, "Solomon Gursky Was 
Here," was greeted last year by critics in his country as the most significant 
event in recent Canadian publishing. 
</P>
<P>
By late February, the Canadian edition, published by Penguin Books of Canada, 
had sold 38,000 copies of a 40,000 print run. The novel was also offered as a 
Canadian Book of the Month Club selection, requiring the printing of an 
additional 20,000 copies. In a country of 25 million, a quarter of whom speak 
French, this was an impressive showing. 
</P>
<P>
"Solomon Gursky" also spent a couple of months on the Toronto Globe and Mail 
best-seller list, earning Richler a cover review in the prestigious magazine 
Books in Canada, and frequent citations in the Canadian newsmagazine Macleans, 
in Saturday Night and in other premium Canadian periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
Richler's books have rarely done this well, proportionately, in the United 
States. But they have always been well received critically. 
</P>
<P>
Released this month in the United States by Knopf, "Solomon Gursky" is a 
556-page family saga, replete with the usual Richler satire and savagery, about 
a boozy writer's lifelong obsession with the doings of a larger-than-life 
Jewish-Canadian patriarch and his offspring. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects the protagonist is a Richler stand-in. And the family is a 
fictional model of the formerly bootlegging, now-legitimate Bronfman clan of 
Montreal, whose doings Canadians regard with almost the same fascination 
Americans have for Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Descendants of a prosperous Russian-Jewish immigrant, the Bronfman family owns 
and controls an enormous and diversified financial empire. In the United 
States, they are best known as the owners of Joseph E. Seagram and Sons. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bronfmans were certainly the trigger," Richler acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"Solomon Gurksy" ranges from Victorian London to the Canadian Arctic, from the 
Depression years on the Canadian Prairie to present-day New York. For Richler, 
who has been particular about setting his best books in the Quebec of his youth 
and, occasionally, in London, this has been a change. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the plot's many little tricks, Richler depicts the fictionalized 
patriarch, Ephraim Gursky, as an escaped British convict who survives one of 
history's most inane attempts to locate the elusive Northwest Passage. Gursky 
subsequently converts the native Inuit to his own lusty brand of Orthodox 
Judaism. The more literal-minded of his adherents, however, are almost driven 
to extinction while trying to comply with the Jewish prohibition against eating 
or drinking until the sun goes down on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. In the 
Arctic, it takes the sun takes half a year to set. 
</P>
<P>
"Solomon Gursky Was Here" has had the added effect of thrusting the acerbic 
Richler himself back into the literary limelight just as critics had begun to 
suspect -- or in some cases hope -- that he might have mellowed. 
</P>
<P>
Bronwyn Drainie, a columnist for the Toronto Globe and Mail, recently noted 
that for Canada's normally genteel literary community, this truly was "the 
winter of public discontent." Few could recall the eruption of so many flaps, 
spats and hissing matches. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do so many of these controversies seem to center on Richler, especially 
when he doesn't go looking for them?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
On his permafrost-ridden home turf, the prickly Richler is a caustic social 
critic who makes Southern California's curmudgeon, Harlan Ellison, seem like 
Mr. Rogers. If Richler inspires equal degrees of loathing in some circles, 
suggests Canadian chronicler John Robert Colombo, perhaps the country's ranking 
anthologist, it may be because he is too worldly, too openly Jewish, too urban 
and too outspoken to suit some super-patriots in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"Although very much engaged in Canadian life and politics," observed Colombo, 
"Richler has always been a thorn in the sides of nationalists in both English 
and French Canada. He is particularly adept at showing the world how absurdly 
both camps can behave." 
</P>
<P>
Richler is, in fact, more outspokenly Canadian in outlook today than ever. But 
he maintains a distinctly Jewish ambivalence toward excessive patriotism -- 
even toward Israeli nationalism -- which he regards as narrow, insular and 
never terribly healthy for minorities. In a country such as Canada, which took 
98 years to settle on a flag of its own, overt displays of nationalism are, 
Richler has observed, even slightly ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
If he wished to, Richler could spare himself the grueling Quebec winters by 
joining the million or so other snowbirds and Canadian expatriates in the 
Southern California sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
During a 20-year self-imposed exile in London (with sojourns in France, Spain 
and Hollywood and frequent visits home), Richler had achieved a certain degree 
of success as a screenwriter and novelist. His screenplay for "Life at the 
Top," which starred Jean Simmons and the late Lawrence Harvey, was well 
received. He also worked on "Room at the Top." The script he adapted from his 
seminal novel, "The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz" a few years after 
returning to Montreal in 1972, was nominated for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Richler learned about the Oscar nomination while visiting Yellowknife, in the 
Northwest Territories. In Yellowknife, the temperature outdoors was 42 below 
zero. But the reception awaiting him at his first Hollywood party was, he would 
discover, no less chilly. 
</P>
<P>
"To mention the Arctic, where I had just come from," he recounted in "Home 
Sweet Home," a collection of essays published five years ago by Knopf, "was to 
watch eyes glaze over in boredom, until I finally learned to say not that I had 
just come down from Yellowknife, but that I had returned from location in 
Yellowknife." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh really? What are they shooting there?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Caribou.' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite his cheek, Richler was later called back to work on the film "Fun With 
Dick and Jane," a prospect he greeted with ambivalence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a day like this, lots of snow, and I said, 'OK, I'll come down. But I 
don't want to meet with any producers, I won't take meetings, and I want a 
first-class ticket for my wife.' They didn't balk at any of my requests, but 
they thought the last one was the funniest thing they ever heard -- this 
strange Canadian backwoodsman actually wanted his wife to come with him." 
</P>
<P>
Richler returned permanently to his homeland in 1972 because he feared his 
literary vision could not survive the separation from his Canadian roots any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't write novels set in England because I wasn't brought up there," 
said Richler. "I, like (Trinidad-born novelist V. S.) Naipaul, don't know what 
an Englishman does when he goes home at night. I saw writers I knew and 
respected, like Doris Lessing and Dan Jacobson, setting novels in biblical and 
far-future times. I figured I'd better go home before that happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
England's and Hollywood's loss has become Canada's gain. John Fraser, the 
editor of Saturday Night, Canada's preeminent magazine of politics, art and 
culture and a frequent publisher of Richler's journalism, has characterized 
"Solomon Gursky" as "vintage, mature Richler." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Richler's previous novels have been rooted in the people and places of 
the Montreal Jewish ghetto of his youth. Richler was the child of Jewish 
immigrants from Russia who quickly steeled themselves against the frigid north 
winds as well as the equally frosty regard in which they were held by the 
province's French-speaking Catholic majority and its almost equally 
disapproving Anglophone minority. 
</P>
<P>
Richler grew up in the St. Urbain Street Jewish ghetto warmly evoked in his 
novels, an impoverished, insular world that was not, however, without charm. 
Many of the places Richler popularized in his book -- the Bagel Factory, for 
instance, and the late Moe Wilensky's corner sandwich store, where a quarter 
once bought a "special" and a Cherry Coke -- have, because of Richler, become 
Montreal icons. 
</P>
<P>
In books like "The Street," "St. Urbain's Horseman," "Joshua Then And Now" and 
"Duddy Kravitz," Richler has kept the period of his youth -- from the start of 
World War II through the early 1950s -- vibrantly alive. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my time, my place," Richler has said, "and I have elected myself to 
get it right." According to one critic, he has brought "his native city of 
Montreal to life as no writer has been able to do before." 
</P>
<P>
He has done so, however, often to the intense discomfort of his fellow Jews, 
who do not always appreciate being reminded -- or having Richler remind others 
-- of their humble origins. Indeed, Richler's relationship with other Montreal 
Jews has been prickliest of all. Many think Mordecai Richler's books and 
pronouncements inspire anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
Richler's readiness to expound irreverently on matters of grave national 
portent have won him few friends in government, federal or provincial. His 
slightest quips tend to make national headlines. Residents of Edmonton, 
Alberta, may never forgive him for saying theirs was a great town if they ever 
decided to uncrate it. 
</P>
<P>
In "Solomon Gursky," a character describes Canada as "a holding tank filled 
with the disgruntled progeny of defeated peoples." 
</P>
<P>
Passages like this, acknowledges Richler, get cited in the Canadian press and 
have earned him most of his notoriety. But Richler's most deadly venom is saved 
for his native Quebec. He is particularly bitter over what he sees as the 
emasculation by Quebec of the province's English-speaking minority, which 
Richler characterizes -- Jew and Gentile alike -- as "gutless." 
</P>
<P>
"For God's sake, they have grown men in the provincial bureaucracy running 
around with tape measures, trying to determine whether the few English-language 
signs permitted in public places use letters that are smaller than those in 
French. 
</P>
<P>
"Future generations," Richler says, "will laugh at our obsessions. We are not 
living through tragedy but farce. If this country flies apart from such 
matters, at least foreigners will find some comic relief in Canada's plight." 
</P>
<P>
Richler believes such comments have earned him the enduring enmity of Quebec 
premier Robert Bourassa, although Bourassa does not speak publicly about 
Richler. Richler has not only held Bourassa up to ridicule within Canada, but 
also has made his government a laughingstock in such prominent American forums 
as the New Yorker, Harper's and the Atlantic Monthly, for which Richler writes 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, these positions have not earned Richler the love of English 
Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys hate Richler," said Colombo, "because he championed the free trade 
deal with the U.S., which most Canadians now regard as a blatant sellout of our 
sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the United States permits, for the first time in Canadian 
history, the relatively free flow of goods and services. Many Canadians believe 
that the protectionism had held Canada, despite its intense regional 
divisiveness, together as a national entity. Without it, Canadians fear the 
commercial and cultural tug of the American behemoth will prove greater than 
the bond among the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Richler has traditionally disparaged Canada's cultural and economic 
protectionism as "tiresome." 
</P>
<P>
"No heritage is worth preserving," he has written, "unless it can survive the 
sun, the mixed marriage, or the foreign periodical." 
</P>
<P>
This position may have been behind Canadian novelist Farley Mowat's savaging of 
Richler in a Toronto weekly this year in a manner some have characterized as 
anti-Semitic. A self-described "chauvinist-nationalist" (who achieved notoriety 
in the United States in 1985 after U.S. customs officials refused him entry 
because of his conservationist activities), Mowat called Richler a 
"non-Canadian" with a Jewish and neighborhood identity but "no sense of 
Canadian identity at all." By attacking Richler's alleged "cosmopolitanism," as 
one critic characterized the quality Mowat objects to, Mowat, wittingly or 
otherwise, used the historical language of anti-Semitism, propagating the 
canard of an innate Jewish incompatibility with patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
But John Fraser, who once spent three weeks in the bush with the author of 
"Never Cry Wolf," does not believe Mowat was intentionally anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
Mowat, notes Fraser, "is a merely another small-town Protestant, who probably 
holds the usual small-town Protestant view of Jews." He is also, according to 
Colombo, a pastoralist who celebrates the virtues of the Canadian wilderness 
and has fantasized in his writing about staging a heroic last stand of loyal 
Canadians against encroaching American imperialists at James Bay. Richler, an 
avowed city slicker and alleged Yank-lover, had populated Mowat's beloved 
Arctic with talisman-sporting, Yiddish-singing Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
The acclaim given Richler's new book was also apparently too much for the three 
judges of Canada's prestigious Governor-General's Award for Literature. Despite 
its ample critical and commercial success, "Solomon Gursky" not only didn't 
win; it wasn't even nominated. 
</P>
<P>
"That it didn't even make the list," said Fraser, "has more to do with politics 
and the motivations of the judges than it does with Richler or his book. I've 
had a look at the competitors, and to me this was madness." 
</P>
<P>
Richler has declined to comment publicly either about the Mowat flap or the 
snubbing of his book. He is at work on another volume of essays and will soon 
begin a new novel. Mostly, though, he says he is content to sit by his fire on 
the frozen shores of Lac Memphremagog, reading quietly and talking with his 
wife, Florence. Montreal, a city he recognizes as sadly diminished in recent 
years as much of the money and talent fled west and south, is a place he now 
visits for a day each week.
