   The proposals are Gargantuan: a 400-mile Grand
Canal from the icy rivers of northern Canada to the Great Lakes, or
an irrigation trench through the Rocky Mountains to the parched
American West.
   Could the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, now in the process
of ratification, make such massive diversions of fresh water a
reality?
   The subject was debated Thursday when two Canadian experts
disclosed that the trade agreement treats water like newsprint,
computers and other ``goods'' now subject to tariffs.
   The treaty will eliminate those tariffs and offer the United
States ``national treatment'' when it comes to Canadian water, said
former trade negotiator Mel Clark and Don Gamble of the Rawson
Academy of Aquatic Science in Ottawa.
   The discovery, they said, contradicts claims by the Conservative
government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that water was not part
of the trade deal.
   When questioned in Parliament, Trade Minister John Crosbie
indirectly confirmed that water exports are possible under the
treaty.
   But Crosbie told opponents that Canada cannot be forced to sell
water or any other natural resource.
   ``We are not obliged to sell one thimbleful of (water) to the
United States,'' he said, citing a federal announcement last
November that large-scale water diversions will not be contemplated.
   Frank Quinn of the government's Inland Waters Directorate told
The Associated Press that Canada wanted water exempted from the
trade deal but abandoned the demand in final compromises with U.S.
negotiators.
   ``In the 11th hour, we didn't get all the changes we wanted,''
he said.
   Quinn said the world General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
which both countries recognize, allows a member to ban exports of
natural resources on grounds of conservation and environmental
protection.
   On that basis, he said, Canada will not permit diversions of
fresh water.
   Quinn said Canada's pledge under the Free Trade Agreement to
share energy resources in times of crisis only covers items
currently exported, such as gas and oil.
   ``We're not now exporting water, only dribs and drabs,'' he said.
   Border towns in Alberta, Manitoba and New Brunswick export small
quantities to local water systems in Montana, North Dakota and
Maine, and there are proposals to export water by tanker from
British Columbia and Quebec.
   In any case, Quinn said, even the thirstiest U.S. states are no
longer considering long-distance diversions because of the cost.
Instead, they are focusing on a transition from agricultural to
municipal use of local water.
   Should the United States run dry, Canada does seem a handy
solution.
   With 7 percent of the world's land area, Canada has 9 percent of
its renewable fresh water supply and only 1 percent of its
population. Eight percent of the country is covered by lakes.
   The problem is that 60 percent of the water flows north toward
the Arctic and is inaccessible to most Canadians, who live huddled
near the U.S. border.
   Thus the grand schemes.
   Newfoundland engineer Tom Kierans has spent 30 years promoting
his dream of turning Arizona desert into lush farmland with water
diverted from the rivers of northern Quebec and Ontario, now
flowing north into James Bay.
   Pumping stations would propel the water into a Grand Canal
across the Canadian Shield to the Ottawa River and on to Lake
Huron. From the Great Lakes, it would be pumped to the prairies and
desert. The estimated cost of construction alone: $100 billion.
   The same pricetag was put on a 1964 idea proposed by Ralph M.
Parsons Ltd., California engineers, to divert the Yukon and
McKenzie rivers through the Rocky Mountain Trench of western Canada
into the United States.
   A comprehensive Canadian study in 1985 advised a ``cautious
approach'' to such projects but called it ``imprudent to reject all
exports out of hand.''
   The author of that report, Professor Peter Pearse of the
University of British Columbia, told the AP the Grand Canal was
``not in anybody's interest on ecological or economic grounds.''
   He said it would cost $2,000 per thousand cubic meters simply to
get the water to the U.S. Southwest.
   Environmentalists oppose transferring water from one basin to
another because of the ecological impact and disruption to Indians
and Inuit dependent on fishing and hunting.
   ``It's always been a fear that this is on somebody's agenda,''
said Julia Langer, Canadian director of the Friends of the Earth.
``We haven't paid enough attention to real water conservation to be
even considering these kinds of megaprojects.''
