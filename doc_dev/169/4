   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government agreed to recognize
native ownership of a vast tract of northern land extending
to the North Pole.
   The new jurisdiction, to be called Nunavut (Land of the
People), is the eastern region of what is now the Northwest
Territories.

   The government said legislation will be introduced next
year to give the natives title to about 136,000 square miles
of land. The new region's 17,500 Inuit (Eskimos) account for
about 80% of its total population.
   The agreement would provide the Inuit with mineral rights
to about 14,000 square miles. The area is thought to have
considerable oil and natural gas and mineral potential.
   Inuit president Louis Pilakapsi called it a "fair
settlement."
   The Canadian government will maintain a regulatory role
over portions of the new territory. An Inuit board will be
established to ensure Inuit participation in regulating the
land. "We welcome industry to come in and do business with
us," an Inuit spokesman said.
   As part of the land claim settlement, the government also
agreed to give the area's inhabitants 580 million Canadian
dollars (US$507.5 million) over 14 years. In return, the
Inuit agreed to give up their claims to any other land in the
Northwest Territories.
   Negotiations are to begin soon on what powers the new
government will have. A final agreement is expected to be
reached in April. Elections are to be held later.
