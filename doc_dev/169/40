   Eye-stinging spruce smoke cloaked
dimly lit figures huddled against sub-zero cold at the end of their
first long day of learning the tricks of arctic survival.
   ``Nothin' but a bunch of Boy Scouts with bad language,'' someone
quipped.
   He was partly right. The only scouts were a half-dozen Eskimo
Scouts who teach the military how to stay alive when it gets so cold
that people from the Lower 48 states can't comprehend it.
   The Scouts' weeklong course 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle
is short on lectures and long on cold. At least four full days and
nights are spent in the wilderness 500 miles northeast of Anchorage.
   Now in its third winter, the Alaska Army National Guard school
has trained about 150 people to cope with temperatures that
consistently range in the neighborhood of 40 degrees below zero. It
hit 45 below on the last two nights of January's class, and a couple
days after the students left, Alaska's great cold wave struck with
temperatures down to 50 and 60 below zero.
   Students run the gamut from Army Special Forces troops to raw
National Guard recruits, and Alaska Adjutant General John Schaeffer
says it is not just non-Alaskans and non-natives that need the
training.
   ``The type of Eskimo we're enlisting today doesn't have the
survival skills of the older Eskimos,'' says Schaeffer, a
participant in the January class. He estimates about half of the
Guard is Eskimo or Indian.
   Because of cultural changes, natives no longer have to rely on
the skills handed down for generations, says Schaeffer, an Eskimo
from Kotzebue. ``We've got a bunch of Eskimos and Indians around
here who would have as much trouble (surviving the cold) as anyone
else.''
   Schaeffer, an experienced arctic outdoorsman, says he attended
the class to lend it some credibility and assure its permanency and
funding.
   ``We're doing what we should have been doing for years _ taking
the skills we've learned from centuries of living here and passing
them on,'' the two-star general says.
   The school was started in response to requests from National
Guard flight crews, who wanted training similar to that offered at
the Air Force's ``Cool School'' at Eielson Air Force Base near
Fairbanks.
   Maj. Jerry Finney, the U.S. Army adviser to the 5th Scout
Battalion of the 297th Infantry, got together with an Arctic Village
hunting buddy, Timothy Sam.
   Sam recruited other instructors from the nearby Gwich'in Indian
villages of Venetie and Fort Yukon, and they began showing students
what it takes to survive.
   The practical experiences of the natives are backed by scientific
data from Finney about human physiology and thermodynamics.
   Finney says one of the most difficult survival obstacles is to
overcome the macho approach to the cold. Too often, soldiers are
afraid to admit they are freezing, he says.
   At 40 below zero, severe frostbite can occur within two to four
hours as the result of a series of minor errors or less than an hour
from one serious mistake, Finney says.
   The worst injury in the six previous classes at Arctic Village
involved a Special Forces sergeant who suffered serious frostbite to
nine toes. Part of the cause was an experimental boot, but much of
it was a stubborn unwillingness to acknowledge the cold, Finney says.
   ``Nobody knows better than you if you're cold,'' Finney preaches.
``If you're cold, do something about it. Deal with it.''
   Shelter construction is one of the areas of major emphasis at the
school. Types of shelters depend on the materials at hand, and the
foothills of the Brooks Range near Arctic Village have plentiful
supplies of stunted black spruce.
   Boughs are used for ground insulation and to thatch the sides and
roofs of lean-tos. Limbless trunks become the framework for the
shelters. Wood is gathered for all-night fires.
   Instructors show students how to snare hares and catch fish to
supplement their diet. But this part of Alaska doesn't support a
bunny population large enough to feed two dozen hungry troops.
Ice-fishing is somewhat more productive.
   Ideally, a caribou would be killed, and instructors detail the
many uses for the meat, hide and entrails. The Gwich'in have
survived on caribou for centuries.
   But this January, the nearest caribou were 80 miles away.
