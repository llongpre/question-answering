   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The once barren wastes of northern Quebec,
untamed and pristine, have been transformed by the construction of
the largest hydroelectric project on earth. The government of
Quebec Province says only good will result; the natives think
otherwise and are prepared to try to hold back further building.

   The $62 billion James Bay project is the
largest hydroelectric development on the planet, cutting roads,
building dams, diverting rivers and changing the face of the earth
in an area as big as France.
   For officials of the Hydro Quebec power company, owned by the
government of the Province of Quebec, taming the wild rivers of
this frigid and practically unpopulated sub-Arctic region is the
cleanest, most economic and socially acceptable way of meeting the
province's growing energy needs into the next century.
   For the 10,000 Cree Indians whose ancestors lived in the
northern Quebec forest here for centuries and who make up one of
the earth's last remaining hunter-trapper societies, the
15-year-old project is disrupting nature, poisoning the fish,
ruining traplines and threatening their traditional way of life.
   And for many environmentalists, the development of the James Bay
region is not only destructive to the fauna and flora, it has been
ill-studied, never subject to public review and may not even be
needed.
   ``If they don't let us develop hydroelectric power, that means
nuclear power at a much higher price, both in money and in
insecurity,'' rejoins Andre Mercier, an engineer and Hydro Quebec's
vice president for system planning in Montreal.
   ``To us, this land is sacred,'' said Matthew Coon-Come, grand
chief of the Crees of Quebec. ``It's the only thing we have left.
It is still our main economic base, hunting and fishing. We are
concerned about the kind of land and environment we leave behind
for our children.''
   Radisson is the end of the road north. After Radisson, you go by
air, by water or you walk. From here to the northern tip of Quebec
Province is 650 miles of trackless taiga and tundra. Until now it
has been the domain of the Cree, a few Inuit Indians and the
occasional hardy white hunter or fisherman.
   Seen from Radisson, a company town of about 2,500 inhabitants
650 miles north of Montreal, the James Bay project is an awesome
engineering accomplishment. In just one phase of construction that
began on one river, La Grande, the company has built nine dams and
206 dikes using 150 million hours of work by 55,000 people. It has
excavated 262 million cubic meters of rock and soil and poured
550,000 tons of concrete into pristine northern rivers. And it
spent $13.8 billion.
   One example of the Herculean nature of the scheme: the
Caniapiscau River, which used to run north and empty into Ungava
Bay, now runs west into the La Grande system and empties most of
its water into James Bay.
   The LG2 dam just east of here, on what 10 years ago was a lonely
river in a vast, silent forest of black spruce, is as high as a
53-story building and is 1} miles long. It required 23 million
cubic meters of fill. That, as Hydro Quebec's on-site public
relations officer Serge Marcoux likes to say, ``is 10 times the
volume of the Cheops Pyramid,'' for all those whose mind's eye
carries a portable pyramid.
   When all 16 LG2 turbine units are operating at the same time,
Marcoux says it requires the equivalent of five Olympic swimming
pools full of water each second, for those who think in terms of
Olympic swimming pools. The reservoir contains enough water to
supply the needs of Montreal for a century.
   And that's not counting LG3 and LG4, or LG1 now under
construction downstream, or the new power plant here called LG2A,
or the Laforge 1 and Laforge 2 plants to come on line in 1993 and
1994. It's mind-boggling.
   Phase 1 of La Grande has added 10,282 megawatts of power to
Hydro Quebec's capacity. A megawatt is 1 million watts. Phase 2 is
adding 4,652 megawatts more. Next on Hydro Quebec's horizon is
development of the Great Whale River, 125 miles north, for another
3,500 megawatts, followed by the Nottaway, Broadback and Rupert
Rivers, known as NBR, 8,000 megawatts.
   The Crees are determined to stop Great Whale and NBR development
and have filed actions in both federal and provincial courts.
   ``Right now, we are economically self-sufficient,'' says
Coon-Come. ``But they are going to destroy it. Then the taxpayers
are going to say, `Those lazy Indians, now we have to pay for their
housing, their health services, their alcohol abuse programs.' They
are going to find their taxes going to these `lazy, drunken
Indians.' That's because they destroyed our economic base.''
   Mercier estimated the hydroelectric potential of the James Bay
rivers at 50,000 megawatts, some of them more cost efficient than
others.
   ``There is no other province or state in North America that is
in such a privileged situation,'' he said. ``It is a resource that
is there to use.''
   In that, Mercier is echoing his boss, Quebec Premier Robert
Bourassa, whose policy is to make hydroelectric development of the
province's vast northland the foundation of the entire economic
development of Quebec, whose leaders in the past have raised the
possibility of secession.
   ``Quebec is a vast hydroelectric plant in the bud, and every day
millions of potential kilowatt hours flow downhill and out to sea.
What a waste,'' Bourassa said in his 1985 book ``Power from the
North.''
   Hydro Quebec revenues represent 5 percent of the province's
gross national product with $5.2 billion in sales to Quebec and
$308 million to the rest of Canada and the United States. It is a
company with $34 billion in assets, but also $22 billion in
long-term debt.
   The sale of electricity to the United States particularly riles
opponents. Many feel Quebec is being raped to run the
air-conditioners of New York.
   Hydro sees foreign sales as subsidizing construction now for
meeting future Canadian needs.
   Seen from Chisasibi, a Cree village of 2,500 about 80 miles to
the west on the shore of James Bay, the development is equally
awesome. It brought the 20th century crashing down on a simple
people.
   Before the project, there was no road to Chisasibi. Nobody had
cars or trucks; there was no television and little store-bought
food. Supplies came in summer by barge from northern Ontario.
   Hydro Quebec built the road and the modern world drove right
down it to the James Bay, bringing better education and health
care. But it also brought the dark side of modern life _
alcoholism, drug abuse and juvenile delinquency.
