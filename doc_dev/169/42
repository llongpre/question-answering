Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Thursday recovered an estimated $3,000 in 
camera gear and clothing that was reported stolen the previous night from an 
entourage traveling with 11-year-old Tony Aliengena, the San Juan Capistrano 
youth who is flying around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties also announced that they had arrested a local man in connection 
with the break-in and theft at the Frobisher Inn, where Tony and 15 members of 
his entourage are staying. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old man, who cannot be identified until conviction under Canadian 
law, is from nearby Lake Harbor but was arrested in this Arctic Circle village. 
Mounted Constable Jim Cook said the man had checked into a room across from 
where Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, had stowed most of the crew's gear. He was 
taken into custody without incident and will be held without bail pending trial 
on charges of break-in and entry. 
</P>
<P>
Because the man is a convicted criminal on probation for a previous break-in 
and theft, Cook said, he faces a possible prison term of three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Was Eating 
</P>
<P>
The property taken Wednesday night included camera gear belonging to both Gary 
Aliengena and Alexie Grinevich, a Soviet journalist accompanying the flight, 
Cook said. Some clothing belonging to Tony and his father was also removed from 
a bag, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The break-in occurred while the Aliengena family and their entourage were 
eating dinner. Maxim Chikin, a fellow Soviet correspondent, discovered the 
theft when he returned from dinner to the ransacked room. 
</P>
<P>
"They have taken my stuff," Chikin said. 
</P>
<P>
Chikin and Grinevich later told the authorities that a man staying in a room 
across the hallway had watched them as they unloaded luggage into the room. The 
Soviets, who arrived here in a chase plane about an hour after Tony landed, 
identified the suspect in custody as the person they had seen. 
</P>
<P>
The theft was viewed as a major embarrassment in this wind-swept outpost of 
3,200 inhabitants, most of them native Inuits. To help soften the blow, the 
Mounted Police detachment here Thursday morning delivered a packet of souvenir 
stickers and pins for the entourage. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the suspect was relatively easy to apprehend because Iqaluit is an 
island community, closed off to the world except for an airport that operates 
commercial flights only by day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Least We Can Do' 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a bunch of people traveling through here on good cause and it's the 
least we can do to try and help them out," Cook said of Tony's friendship 
mission around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's father assured the Canadians that there were no hard feelings. The 
Aliengena family rested in Iqaluit on Thursday, meeting students at the local 
school and taking joy rides around a frozen bay on a Hoverjet. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a ball here," Aliengena said at an Iqaluit press conference Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's flight was scheduled to resume at 8:30 a.m. PDT today, with a 1,700-mile 
flight across the North Atlantic Ocean from Iqaluit to Reykjavik, Iceland. The 
flight is expected to last nine hours, not including a two-hour refueling stop 
in bGreenland. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Tony is scheduled to make European landfall at Oslo, Norway.
