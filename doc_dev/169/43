   A Soviet-American dog sledding team announced
plans Tuesday to symbolically break the ice between Siberian and
Alaskan Eskimos during a 1,200-mile goodwill trek that will include
the first sanctioned crossing of the Bering Strait since 1948.
   Ten men and two women, comprising six Soviets and six Americans,
plan to depart March 1 from Anadyr, Siberia, on a two-month journey
visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route.
   The expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common
cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the Bering region,
expedition co-leader Paul Schurke, 33, of Minneapolis, said at a
news conference at the Russian Tea Room in Manhattan.
   ``Some of the team members have relatives on the other side,''
Schurke said, so it could be a very emotional experience.
   Because visitors are rare in villages so close to the top of the
world, he predicted that the expedition would be met with
``spontaneous celebrations and jamborees'' and that schools would be
let out so that the children could ski along with the team for a
while.
   A veteran of Arctic travel who made an unassisted trek to the
North Pole in 1986, Schurke said the journey was ``an opportunity to
combine my interest in travel in the north with playing a part in
the process of improving Soviet-American relations.''
   Speaking through an interpreter, Soviet co-leader Dmitry Shparo,
47, of Moscow, praised Du Pont Co., the major American corporate
sponsor of the Bering Bridge Expedition. Shparo also put in a plug
for the main Soviet sponsors, Pravda's youth newspaper, the tourist
bureau known as Sputnik and Novosti, a news agency.
   Although he is a mathematics professor at Moscow's Institute of
Steel and Alloys, Shparo is best known as a writer and adventurer.
In 1979, he won the Soviet Union's highest honor, the Order of
Lenin, for successfully leading a ski expedition to the North Pole.
Last year, he was a member of a Soviet-Canadian trek across the
polar ice cap from the USSR to Canada.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who also attended the news
conference, called the Bering Bridge Expedition ``another step
toward melting the ice curtain.''
   Murkowski noted that the U.S. government is working on a new
treaty with the Soviets that would permit American Eskimos to visit
and trade with their counterparts in Siberia without visas.
   In 1938, the two countries signed an agreement that regularized
travel in the Bering region, but that agreement was abrogated in
1948 during the iciest days of the Cold War.
   In the spirit of adventure diplomacy, the team hopes a new
agreement can be signed at a ceremony at the U.S.-Soviet border
around April 1.
