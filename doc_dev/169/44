   The outcome of the two-week effort to free
two California gray whales may never be known as the massive mammals
faced 200 miles of ice-clogged waters on the way to their winter
home.
   Indeed, the sentiment among rescuers Friday was that ignorance
would be bliss if the whales died soon after more than $1 million
and countless hours of labor were spent trying to save them.
   ``A lot of people just didn't want to know'' about their fate,
said federal marine mammal biologist Jim Harvey.
   Rescuers decided against affixing radio transmitters to the
animals. That entailed additional expense, and rescue coordinator
Ron Morris said little scientific knowledge could be gained from
tracking a pair of young, lost whales.

   The two whales that captured the world's attention
off Alaska should have been eaten instead of freed from the ice, an
Eskimo activist says.
   ``In my mind, there's something wrong to save these two whales
while you are destroying the life of the human beings of the
North,'' Aqqaluk Lynge, of the Greenland office of the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference, said Friday at a news conference that
concluded a three-day meeting on arctic cooperation.
   ``To my mind it's a degradation of human values,'' he said.

   UNDATED _ Anti-abortion protesters planned pickets and blockades
at clinics across the country today after their weekend of
demonstrations kicked off with nearly 200 arrests in four states.
   The New York-based Operation Rescue planned demonstrations in 32
U.S. cities and said as many as 5,000 people could be arrested.
   Today's protests marked a continuation of the anti-abortion
campaign that has resulted in about 7,000 arrests nationwide in the
last five months. The campaign began in July during the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, and more than 1,200 people have been
taken into custody in 20 demonstrations in the Georgia capital since
then.

   The Reagan administration has rejected a rice
industry request for a federal investigation of Japanese barriers to
rice imports, averting a political storm in Japan and threatening
one in the United States.
   The decision announced Friday was something of a surprise and was
the first important test of the new, tougher 1988 Omnibus Trade Act
that was designed to help restore the competitiveness of American
goods on foreign markets.
   Disappointed U.S. rice industry officials condemned the decision
and said in a statement that it hoped the new administration to take
office in January ``will be more concerned about promoting U.S.
interests than pleasing foreign governments ...''
   Clayton Yeutter, the special trade representative, said in
announcing the decision to reject a petition of rice growers and
millers that Japan's virtual ban on imported rice was indefensible
and intolerable. He said it would be vigorously challenged, but not
in the bilateral fashion demanded by U.S. rice farmers.

   President Daniel Ortega has accused the
United States of ordering thousands of rebels to re-enter Nicaragua
and sabotage reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane
Joan.
   ``Taking advantage of the damage, the trauma, the Yankees have
already ordered the infiltration of 3,000 mercenaries into
Nicaraguan territory,'' Ortega said Friday in a nationwide radio and
television address.
   In Washington, State Department press officer Anita Stockman
denied the allegations. ``No U.S. military aid is being provided to
the Contras at this time,'' she said, referring to the rebels.
   Rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros said in Washington that the
Contras were receiving only U.S. humanitarian aid.

   Lawn darts, blamed for at least three deaths
and several thousand injuries in recent years, probably will be off
the market by Christmas.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted Friday to ban the
game, and commission officials said the restriction could be in
force as early as mid-December.
   The commission also approved safety standards for all-terrain
vehicles which extend the prohibition on sales of three-wheel
versions of those machines.
   The ban on lawn darts does not include a recall of the games
already in people's homes. That prompted Commissioner Carol Dawson
to issue a plea to parents to keep the darts out of the hands of
children.

   Economists are disputing the Reagan
administration's contention that the budget deficit's underlying
trend is downward despite a small increase for 1988.
   The Treasury Department and the White House Office of Management
and Budget reported Friday that the imbalance between revenues and
spending rose to $155.1 billion for the budget year that ended Sept.
30, a $5.4 billion increase over 1987.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in a joint statement with
the OMB, pointed out that several one-time events, including the
phase-in of the new tax law, cut the 1987 deficit and inflated the
1988 budget gap.
   Excluding those special factors, the deficit would have fallen
$31.1 billion between 1987 and 1988, he said, adding, ``The
underlying trend in the deficit ... remains downward.''
