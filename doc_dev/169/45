<HEAD>Study: Milk Of Canadian Eskimo Women Has Highest PCB Level In World</HEAD>

   The milk of nursing Eskimo women in northern
Quebec has a higher level of PCBs than that of women anywhere in the
world, according to a university study published today.
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, have been linked to cancer
and skin rashes.
   The 1987 study at Laval University in Ste-Foy, Quebec, obtained
by the daily Le Devoir newspaper of Montreal, compared 24 samples of
milk from Eskimo women in northern Quebec to that of 48 women from
southern Quebec, some from an industrial suburb of Quebec City and
the rest from Baie-Comeau on the shore of the lower St. Lawrence
near an aluminum smelter.
   The fat in the milk of the Eskimo women showed an average PCB
concentration of 3.59 parts per million compared to 0.76 for the
rest of the samples, the newspaper said. Some Eskimo women had a
concentration of 14.7.
   Health and Welfare Canada, the federal agency responsible for
health regulations, has set a tolerance level of 1.5 parts per
million.
   Eskimo women in northern Quebec tend to breast feed their babies
for up to 23 months. Their diet for centuries has included large
amounts of fish and animal fat.
   Le Devoir quoted the study as saying an Eskimo child nursed by a
mother whose milk has the average amount of PCB contamination would
have imbibed enough of the toxic chemical within a year to show
observable effects such as skin problems, liver complaints and
problems with their immune system.
   Among women whose milk is highly contaminated, such effects might
appear after four or five months, the newspaper said.
   The authors of the study say the PCBs in the area enter the
environment from industrial waste poured into rivers and coastal
waters and could come from as far away as the Soviet Union.
   Eric Dewailly of Laval University's hospital center, who directed
research for the study, was quoted as telling Le Devoir that fish in
the St. Lawrence river ``are more contaminated than those in the
north.
   ``But we southerners eat a lot less fish than the Inuit
(Eskimo),'' he said.
   The Laval scientists plan to monitor the subjects and their
children for the next year, the newspaper said.
