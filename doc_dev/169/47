   The Canadian utility representative spoke of
kilowatts, reservoirs and big savings to taxpayers, but the grand
chief of the Cree Indian tribe saw a giant hydroelectric project in
a different light.
   ``It will be a cultural genocide for us,'' said Cree Grand Chief
Matthew Coon-Come. ``Our main diet is fish. They tell us we cannot
eat the fish.''
   ``America, you are the builder. Wall Street is financing. It's
time the little guy starts speaking up,'' Coon-Come said Thursday
after he and other Indians paddled up in a canoe and climbed onto a
lower Manhattan dock in the shadow of skyscrapers.
   It was the last stop on a 1,300-mile trip from their Quebec
homes.
   Coon-Come and Robert Brunette, a vice president of the
government-owned Hydro-Quebec, differ about how much land the
project would affect. Estimates range as high as several hundred
thousand square miles.
   Most of the power generated would benefit Canada. But up to 10
percent would be exported to various of the United States.
   The project requires reversing the course of three rivers.
   And it means building six more dams along five rivers that flow
into James Bay in northern Quebec.
   The contracts to finance the project and sell the power have
been signed. The only remaining obstacles are approval from
Canada's National Energy Board and an avalanche of bad publicity
brought on by the 10,000 Cree and Inuit Indians who live along the
James Bay.
   Brunette conceded that some species of fish would be made
inedible by mercury contamination.
   ``There is jubilation in my heart and also I cry,'' said
Coon-Come, relieved at completing his journey but predicting
doomsday for his home environment.
   ``Some people call us primitive,'' Coon-Come said. ``We still
hunt and fish as a way of life. We have protected that land.''
   He drew sympathy from Dennis DeLeon, New York City's Human
Rights commissioner, and from city Councilwoman Miriam Friedlander,
who said people ``continue without thinking to destroy fragile
parts of the earth.''
   The New York Power Authority says that buying hydroelectric
power from Quebec since 1978 has saved more than $600 million and
eliminated the need for nearly 6 billion gallons of oil.
   The state would be able to start drawing power from the new
project in 1995, saving about $3 billion over 20 years, said Power
Authority Chairman Richard Flynn.
   He said the project would cause significantly less environmental
damage than the coal-burning plants that would have to be built
otherwise.
   As for the Indians, Flynn said, ``We really think it's an
internal affair for the Canadians.''
