A Dollars 300m zinc refinery might be built in Greenland to process some of
the raw material which at present is shipped from the Canadian Arctic to
Europe for refining.
Substantial quantities of zinc concentrate are produced in the Canadian
Arctic and the supply is expected to increase in 1997 with the start-up of
Metall Mining's Isok Lake project in the Northwest Territories.
Greenland's refinery, which would employ about 350 people and be built near
the capital, Nuuk, would use cheap electricity from a hydroelectric facility
which is nearing completion and will be in full production next year.
Mr Robert Gannicott, president of Platinova A/S, the company behind the
scheme, pointed out that Greenland was only half the distance from the
Canadian Arctic compared to Europe - an important consideration when the
Canadian mines had such short shipping seasons.
Nuuk is on Greenland's south-west coast which is kept ice-free all year by
the Gulf Stream. It offers regular, scheduled shipping services to Europe
and North America and considerable excess capacity in ships leaving
Greenland which could accommodate refined metal, Mr Gannicott said.
Platinova - a junior exploration company, quoted in Toronto with mainly
Canadian and European shareholders - has ordered a pre-feasiblity study of
the refinery project from both Sherritt Gordon and Hatch and Associates.
Mr Gannicott was speaking in London during presentations by the Greenland
government designed to encourage mining and oil companies to do more
exploration.
Mr Lars Emil Johansen, premier of Greenland, a country nearly the size of
the US but with a population of only 55,000, was particularly enthusiastic
about a high-grade gold deposit at Nalunaq in the Kirkespir Valley. This was
discovered recently by Nunaoil A/S, a company jointly owned by Greenland and
Denmark, and Mr Johansen said he hoped the find would support a gold mine
which could be producing from 1996-97.
Microdiamonds have also been discovered in west Greenland and RTZ, the
world's biggest mining company, is at present concentrating its exploration
efforts in the country on diamonds.
