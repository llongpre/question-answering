   Eskimos from four nations, guarding a
tradition of hunting and fur trading, criticized animal
conservationists for threatening the culture of Arctic people.
   Rosemarie Kuptana, vice president of the Inuit Circumpolar
Conference, urged delegates to force environmentalists and animal
conservationists ``to answer our arguments,'' the Greenland
newspaper Information reported Friday.
   ``Our opponents are much weeker when it is we who set the
agenda,'' Ms. Kuptana, a Canadian, told the 500 Inuit delegates at
a conference's meeting in Sisimuit, West Greenland.
   It was the first time a Soviet delegation attended a general
assembly of the conference, a non-governmental organization for
Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Soviet Union.
   Anger is growing among Arctic natives toward conservationist
groups such as Greenpeace, whose campaigns the Eskimos say have
damaged hunting and the fur trade.
   ``It never ceases to amaze me how people can react so strongly
against traditional hunting on the part of a little group of
indigenous people _ people who during thousands of years of hunting
never have threatened a single animal species _ while at the same
time industrialized society has polluted the planet to such a
degree that there is no way back,'' Ms. Kuptana said.
   Greenpeace's Kirsten Sander, who attended the conference as an
observer, admitted that the group's campaign against seal skins in
recent years had done unintended harm to Inuit hunters.
   To counter future anti-harvesting campaigns, the conference
unveiled a far-reaching Inuit conservation strategy.
   This policy, largely the initiative of conference members from
Canada and Greenland, embraces all aspects of environmental concern
in the Arctic.
   Peter Jull, a former Inuit adviser to the Canadian government,
said the document calls for detailed research on the environment
and wildlife, including all species that Inuits depend on for food
and clothing.
   He said the plan was partly ``an expression that the environment
is our interest and not just for the benefit of companies down
south somewhere.''
   The conference also compiled a guide of policy principles on
issues including nuclear power, education and self-government for
use at the regional and local levels.
   ``What we're basically saying is that we live in the Arctic and
we know what happens when you mess it up,'' Jull said.
   About 40,000 Inuit live in Greenland, 28,000 in Alaska and
11,000 in Canada. The Soviet Inuit comprise a small part of the
150,000 natives of the Siberian north.
