<HEAD>Greenland Premier Calls Election in Wake of Political Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greenland Premier Jonathan Motzfeldt
has called for March elections following a scandal arising from
allegations that Cabinet ministers misused public funds, news
reports said Monday.
   Opponents of Motzfeldt's socialist government claim to have
documents to show that government members, including the premier,
spent state money on lavish meals for the party faithful, the
Greenland newspaper Atuagagdliutit said.
   Motzfeldt, a pastor of the Greenland Lutheran Church, has held
the premiership since Greenland won partial independence from
Denmark in 1979.
   About 53,000 people reside in Greenland, which has 840,000
square miles of territory, about 80 percent of it ice-covered.
   Motzfeldt allegedly used $9,000 of taxpayers' money on a
luxurious dinner in support of his own re-election as party leader,
the paper said.
   Bowing to opposition demands that his administration resign,
Motzfeldt set the vote for March 5.
   In the last ballot, in May 1987, Motzfeldt's Siumut Party and
the non-socialist opposition Atassut Party each won 11 mandates in
the 16-seat Landsting, or homerule parliament.
   Siumut formed a coalition with the leftist Inuit Ataqatigiit
party, which has one mandate.
   The conservative-leaning Issittup Party has four.
