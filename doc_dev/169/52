Tony Aliengena, bone weary after a nine-hour, 1,450-mile transoceanic flight 
that began in snow flurries in northern Canada and took him through four time 
zones, safely landed his single-engine Cessna early today in this island 
capital in the northern Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, an 11-year-old from San Juan Capistrano who is trying to become the 
youngest aviator to fly around the world, crawled out of his cramped cockpit at 
2 a.m. as a setting sun cast a pinkish glow over this seaport metropolis that 
is flanked by snow-capped peaks. 
</P>
<P>
Looking very tired, the boy, whose parents normally send him to bed at 9:30 
p.m., when asked how he felt, replied abruptly, "Good," and marched straight to 
his hotel room on the 12th day after setting out from Orange County's John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, his family and an entourage from another chase plane all checked into a 
local hotel, where they are to rest today before attempting to complete the 
North Atlantic crossing Sunday with a 1,000-mile flight to Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
A second chase plane, however, was forced to turn back to an earlier refueling 
stop in Greenland after a directional compass malfunctioned during the second 
leg to Reykjavik. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine Cessna, piloted by Colorado businessman Pat Wiesner, returned 
to Sondrestrom, Greenland, where it had to be repaired and refueled before he 
could rejoin the group. Aboard his plane are three members of a Los Angeles 
film crew that is producing a documentary about Tony's flight, as well as 
Soviet journalist Alexie Grinevich. 
</P>
<P>
The all-day flight began Friday morning in Iqaluit, Canada, a remote Eskimo 
village near the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The entourage had been dreading the North Atlantic crossing ever since Tony 
departed Orange County June 5 on his Friendship Flight. It began ominously 
enough Friday, with snow flurries and blowing winds in Iqaluit, which is in 
Canada's Northwest Territories. 
</P>
<P>
At a weather briefing at the Iqaluit airport, the pilots were warned of an 
arctic storm system in their path on the way to the refueling spot in 
Sondrestrom, on Greenland's western coast. 
</P>
<P>
The storm system was showing the presence of freezing rain at higher flying 
altitudes, according to the weather forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions were so poor that Yves Landry, weather meteorologist at the airport 
in Iqaluit warned: "If it were me, I would stay home." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no pilots had yet traversed the ocean route that day, they were told. 
But Gary Aliengena, Tony's father and coordinator of the flight, opted to press 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before takeoff, Tony and his entourage donned orange wet suits and 
tucked life preservers behind their seats. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's mother, who was riding in another chase plane piloted by Dr. Lance 
Allyn, explained the importance of the suits to her 10-year-old daughter, 
Alaina. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go down in the water, the water is very cold," said Susan Aliengena, as 
she helped her pony-tailed daughter into the suit. "And this will keep you from 
dying." 
</P>
<P>
After departing through gray storm clouds during light snow flurries over 
Iqaluit, the three planes emerged into clear blue skies and managed to stay 
above the storm system centered over the Davis Strait, between Canada's arctic 
islands and Greenland. 
</P>
<P>
At Sondrestrom -- a U.S. Air Force Base -- Tony descended into an eerie world 
of glacial peaks and aquamarine fjords. Also visible was the start of 
Greenland's massive icecap, which runs to a maximum thickness of two miles. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesner's plane developed mechanical problems about one hour after leaving 
Sondrestrom on the 800-mile leg to Iceland, so he turned back. 
</P>
<P>
But Tony and Allyn continued on, flying closely to maintain radio contact along 
the open expanse of ocean where they were out of touch of air-traffic control 
radar. 
</P>
<P>
Tony crossed the east coast of Greenland about two hours after leaving 
Sondrestrom, soaring above a foreboding mass of jagged peaks that abutted a 
seemingly endless expanse of frozen ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean ice was breaking from the June thaw and was dotted with icebergs. 
Soon though, the ocean was concealed from view by a thick layer of low-lying 
clouds, which stretched to the Icelandic coast. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, while flying through clear skies, Allyn glanced down at the ice 
and tapped the dashboard of his twin-engine Beechcraft King Air lovingly. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we can stay up here, I don't know," Allyn said. 
</P>
<P>
While halfway over the ocean, Maxim Chikin, another Soviet journalist 
accompanying the flight, leaned his head into Allyn's cockpit and asked 
nervously: "Where is land." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after two long hours of cold ocean flight, the snowy cliffs of western 
Iceland emerged into view. Chikin rolled his eyes in relief. 
</P>
