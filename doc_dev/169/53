   For days, Lee Barr Sr. has seen
occasional falling snow when he looks out his window in the
northwest Alaska village of Kiana. In a couple of weeks, he said,
the Kobuk River will be ice.
   It's hard for him to imagine what his serviceman son, Marvin, is
experiencing in the hot desert of Saudi Arabia.
   ``He's doing good so far - he says he's getting used to it,''
Barr said of the 21-year-old Marine, one of several Alaska Eskimos
stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   Marvin's first letter home arrived recently. He said he missed
his mother's baking and native food. His father laughs at the
thought of smoked salmon and dried caribou meat in Saudi Arabia.
   ``He said it was kind of warm - and it must have been hot down
there if he says warm,'' his father said in a telephone interview.
``When he talks about something he can't make things sound bad.
He's always been like that.''
   Marvin is one of Lee and Viola Barr's eight children and has
been a Marine for nearly four years. He has been in Saudi Arabia
for about a month.
   ``It was kind of hard at first, I guess,'' said his father.
``The heat and wondering what they were going to do - whether they
were going to have action.''
   ``It's kind of hard for us too, wondering.''
   Lee Barr hopes his son and all American military personnel will
come home soon. He doesn't think they should be in Saudi Arabia to
begin with.
   ``It's just for the money,'' he said of the American military
presence in the Persian Gulf. ``There's a lot of other things that
need to be done. The people that are starving, people who are sick
- those things we just ignore and we're getting into somebody's
business.''
   The Barrs' neighbors, Lorenze and Nellie Schuerch, have two sons
in the Marines, but neither has gone to Saudi Arabia yet.
   One of them, 20-year-old Vincent, is home on leave for 20 days
from his base at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
   Vincent Schuerch said he's has been hunting and helping out
around home, but is ready to go back when needed. He'd like to see
Saudi Arabia.
   ``If the opportunity came to see a different country, yes, I
would like to go,'' he said. ``Just to say I've been down there.''
   His mother supports the U.S. action in the Middle East but hopes
things settle down before her boys are sent over.
   ``My concern is the possibility of chemical warfare,'' she told
the Arctic Sounder newspaper in Kotzebue.
   ``If that doesn't happen, we still have that heat in Saudi
Arabia. Living in the Arctic all of their lives, and then going to
120-degree Saudi Arabia heat, I don't know how anybody can adjust
to that. I don't know how an Eskimo can adjust to that.''
