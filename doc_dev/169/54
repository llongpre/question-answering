   Alaska's vast wilds challenge commonly held
notions about wilderness management. In the Brooks Range, officials
weigh the rule book against the rights of natives who obey an older
mandate: follow the caribou. This is the second story in a four-part
series, American Wilderness.

   This is the
nation's premier wilderness park, cherished by seekers of solitude
and protected by law from degradation, a soul-stirring expanse of
rugged mountains, icy rivers, caribou and grizzly bears.
   But something is wrong with this picture. All-terrain vehicles
are rumbling across the tundra, and park officials entrusted to
guard the land propose removing 75,000 acres from wilderness status,
the largest deletion in the history of the national wilderness
preservation system.
   What's going on here?
   The answer involves a concept of wilderness different from
anything found in the lower 48 states. It involves a struggle to
balance the value of Alaska's wild land against the rights of humans
who still live in it.
   Most of all, it involves people like Joby Ahgook, a Nunamiut
Eskimo who lives in a little village high in the Brooks Range,
bounded on three sides by the park.
   ``Years ago, when people settled here, they followed the
caribou,'' Ahgook said the other day as he and his family bounced
across the tundra in an eight-wheeled ATV. ``We're still following
the caribou. I want to continue to hunt, even if this is a park.
This is very important to my family, and their families to be.''
   Ahgook's village is called Anaktuvuk Pass, after a native word
meaning ``place of caribou droppings.'' It is an odd name only to
outsiders. Caribou has been the Nunamiuts' staff of life for
generations. Their grandparents ate caribou meat fresh and dried.
They walked in caribou-skin shoes, lived in caribou-skin tents, and
slept in caribou-skin blankets.
   Like the animals they hunted, the Nunamiut were nomads. Each
spring and fall, they walked into the mountains to intercept caribou
migrating through the passes. In summer, they headed north to trade
with coastal Eskimos.
   This is not ancient history. The Nunamiut had no permanent
settlement until the late 1940s. By 1960, they still lived in sod
huts.
   A few huts remain, but most residents now live in well-insulated
prefab houses. The huskies that hunters once used as pack dogs have
been replaced by snowmobiles and Argos, big ATVs with six or eight
low-pressure tires.
   But the Nunamiut still lead a harsh existence. No roads connect
Anaktuvuk Pass to the outside world. When the winter sun barely
sneaks over the mountains, temperatures can sink to 60 below for
days.
   Food and fuel are outrageously expensive, since everything must
be flown in. So residents still depend on caribou for much of their
diet. Antlers adorn roofs all over town, and skins hang drying on
porch rails.
   It's the kind of life that makes you want to cut these people
some slack _ and that is just what Congress did in 1980 when it
passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
   The act set aside more than 100 million acres of Alaska in
national parks, preserves, forests and wildlife refuges. Within
these areas, it designated 56 million acres as wilderness, more than
doubling the size of the national wilderness system.
   Gates of the Arctic's 7 million acres of wilderness, together
with 5.8 million acres next door in the Noatak National Preserve,
comprise the nation's largest stretch of unbroken wilderness.
   Vast as it is, Alaska's wilderness is not as pure in definition
as the lower 48 variety. Congress compromised some traditional
wilderness restrictions out of concern for rural Alaskans like the
Nunamiut _ who, it was argued, were as much a part of the wilderness
as the caribou.
   While motorized travel is strictly prohibited in most lower 48
wilderness areas, Alaska's wilderness system allows snowmobiles,
motorboats and airplanes.
   Anaktuvuk Pass residents supported creation of the park around
them because they thought it would keep out sport hunters while
allowing them to continue their subsistence hunt of caribou. But
they bridled at unexpected park regulations.
   The biggest fight has been over ATVs, one of the few forms of
mechanized transportation prohibited by the lands act. Anaktuvuk
Pass hunters argue the ATVs are essential for summer trips.
   ATVs leave tracks in the fragile tundra, sometimes digging deep
ruts into wet ground. While long-term damage to vegetation has not
been proved, tracks often can be seen for years afterward,
detracting from the ``ultimate wilderness experience'' that the park
strives to give the 2,000 or so visitors who fly in each year.
   A 1983 agreement established a narrow ATV corridor from Anaktuvuk
Pass to a popular lake. But that proved too limiting, and in 1986,
the park service gave villagers temporary permission to continue
what they had been doing illegally all along: following the caribou,
even if it meant driving across wilderness.
   Local park officials, meanwhile, worked out a complicated deal
with the natives that both sides feel addresses most of the problems.
   The park service would de-authorize 75,000 acres of wilderness
near the village and allow the natives ``wandering rights'' over
159,000 additional acres of park land. In exchange, 18,000 acres
elsewhere in the park would be designated wilderness, and the
natives would give up development rights on 93,000 acres of their
own land.
   ``I think it's a reasonably fair exchange of interests,'' says
park superintendent Roger Siglin. ``It definitely compromises
wilderness. But it's also a significant compromise on the part of
the natives involved.''
   Siglin still has to sell the idea to his superiors, the public
and Congress. Only Congress can de-authorize wilderness, something
that's been done just twice before, for minor adjustments to
wilderness areas in Vermont and Florida.
   Environmentalists want to see a draft environmental impact
statement, due out this winter, before responding formally. But they
express sympathy for the Nunamiut.
   ``I don't consider taking wilderness out of the preservation
system very lightly, no matter what the circumstances are,'' says
Allen E. Smith, Alaska regional director of the Wilderness Society.
But, he adds, ``the reality is there has to be some give. There is a
legitimate problem here that has to be fixed.''
   Siglin says he believes the compromise will win approval, ``if
only because I don't think anybody else has a better idea.''
   Joby Ahgook hopes that Siglin is right. When Ahgook was 10, he
walked behind his father on hunting forays into the mounains. Now,
at age 40, he loads his own five children into an ATV for hunting
trips. The mechanism is different, but the point is the same: follow
the caribou.
   Indeed, as he maneuvers the noisy ATV across the tundra, he seems
to have some wandering caribou spirit in him. He sweeps his hand,
encompassing a dozen mountain peaks flanking the pass.
   ``We go way past those mountains in these machines,'' he shouts
over the roar of the engine. ``It's great. We go all over.''
   Wherever you want?
   ``Yeah,'' the son of nomads says, smiling broadly. ``Wherever we
want.''
