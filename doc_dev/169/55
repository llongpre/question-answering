<HEAD>U.S.-Canada Agreement Clears Way for Icebreaker to Use Northwest
Passage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Canadian agreement has cleared the
way for the Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Star to head east through
the Northwest Passage since ice blocked the vessel's usual westward
route.
   A State Department official confirmed the agreement Monday but
refused to be identified because the deal had not been formally
announced.
   ``We requested consent to transit the Northwest Passage, and the
Canadians gave it,'' the diplomat said.
   Canada claims the Northwest Passage as territorial waters, while
the United States asserts an international right of passage through
waterways between the polar icecap and Canada's Yukon and Northwest
Territories.
   With offices of both government closed Monday because of
Columbus Day in the United States and Thanksgiving in Canada, John
Fieldhouse of the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., said from
his home that the Polar Star would be allowed to pass through the
disputed waters.
   ``They're on their way,'' Fieldhouse said.
   The 399-foot ship was unsuccessful last weekend in attempts to
break through the ice-clogged Beaufort Sea west of Prudhoe Bay in
northern Alaska, said Coast Guard Lt. Geoff Merrell in Juneau.
   ``It is what they call multiyear ice ... the icing conditions
were quite heavy,'' Merrell said.
   The Polar Star, which had been on a support mission for arctic
scientists, returned to Prudhoe Bay for restocking while officials
decided the next course of action.
   Last week, the Canadian government granted a U.S. request to let
the Polar Star enter arctic waters claimed by Canada to refuel and
repair a turbine, said Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark.
   The request marked the first test of the Canada-U.S. Arctic
Cooperation Agreement that was signed in January. Under the pact,
the United States agreed to seek Canadian permission before surface
ships enter Canadian waters.
   Canada protested when the Polar Star's twin icebreaker, Polar
Sea, traveled through the Northwest Passage in 1985.
   Had Canada denied permission for the Polar Star, the ship would
have spent the winter at Prudhoe Bay with a skeleton crew, said
Coast Guard Lt. Pete Marsh in Seattle.
