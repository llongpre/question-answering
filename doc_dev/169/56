<F P=106> [Article by Irina Pirogova: "Drums Are Pounding in My Heart: </F>
Future of Small Ethnic Groups of the North Endangered"] 
  [Text] Anadir-Uzlen-Buktha Provideniya- Moscow--Not so long 
ago I caught sight of an issue of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS which 
contained an article by the writer Valeriy Povolyayev entitled 
"Why Do the Chukchi Have Russian Names?" I read it carefully 
because I spent my school years on Chukotka and I have been 
there on business trips. This opus left me with a wild 
impression. The former Soviet writer, ex-secretary of the Union 
of Writers of the RSFSR and an activist in the Komsomol-Youth 
and other widespread publications, retells from the words of his 
dinner partner a couple of old anecdotes about residents of the 
North. For instance, about the fact that a representative of the 
local authorities when filling out passports, not being terribly 
bright, filled in all of them with names like Ivan Ivanov, 
Petrov, Sidorov, etc., and a photographer who was no better 
pasted photographs of one person in all the documents--he said 
they all looked the same. 
  Funny, is it not? Especially when you find out that the 
writer's friend was talking about Koryaks, who live, as we know, 
on Kamchatka, while the article made no mention at all of 
Chukchi. Is it worthwhile to waste paper and ink on such a 
"myth"? The answer, which is simple for any self-respecting 
writer, is not only not acceptable to Povolyayev but, on the 
contrary, he tries to capitalize on other people's anecdotes, as 
it were, cutting himself a piece of ham from the overall 
swinishness. Hence the attempt to appear as one who tells 
"pretty tales" about international friendship supposedly 
generated by the "empire of evil," from which Povolyayev broke 
away, after being treated extremely well there, again in the 
name of the triumph of democracy. 
  I was inclined to remain silent. Let God be his judge. But 
my 
pain over the fate of that wonderful land to which I had come so 
close, its small and adult children, would not leave me in peace 
all this time. As for the friendship of peoples, which is now 
threatening to become anathema, we would do better to listen to 
the writer Yuriy Rytkheu. 
  "I recall a case from my childhood," said Rytkheu. "In 1940 
an unprecedented flu epidemic broke out among us in Uzlen, and 
at that time the Northern peoples were not so protected. We were 
all in bed in our tepees. There was nobody to go hunting. And we 
had nothing with which to buy food. We were already eating 
cooked strips of leather, pieces of walrus hide. And suddenly 
some incredible news spread through our tepees: Everyone could 
go to the store and take food, whatever he needed and however 
much he wanted. Absolutely free of charge. At first nobody 
believed this, and then somebody decided to go and see. I went 
too. It all turned out to be true. To this day I get a lump in 
my throat when I recall this. 
  "The country was at war. Leningrad, besieged by the enemy, 
was under a blockade. The entire working rear was on a 
starvation ration, and suddenly the store in Uzlen was opened 
wide and we were taking bread baked by the Russian baker Uncle 
Kolya from an unmanned store, without a salesman. Perhaps it was 
this bread that saved my compatriot Anna Ntutetegryne, who later 
became chairman of the Chukotka district ispolkom [executive 
committee] and a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet 
of the USSR. And my sister Galya, who is working as an animal 
breeder. And myself, whose first teacher of literature was 
Aleksandr Tvardovskiy. And many others of my countrymen...Yuriy 
and Galina Rytkheu, Antonina Kymtytval, Anna Ntutetegryne, Zoya 
Nenlyumkina, Nina Akukyn, Vladislav Rintetegin--Russian first 
names, Chukchi and Eskimo last names. These were their parents' 
names. 
  "And as for certain difficulties with the pronunciation and 
writing, perhaps our state which is zealously striving to be 
democratic should take the path of Western 'civilized' 
countries. Yuriy Sergeyevich told me about the only Eskimo 
student in Canada, Mary Carpenter, from the University of 
Western Ontario. She gave him a brochure published by the 
Indian-Eskimo Association of Canada which said Canadians spend 
on average per year: $500 million on travel abroad, $1 
billion--on alcoholic beverages, $200 million--on confectionery 
items, and $30 million--on food for dogs and cats. And reading 
on in this brochure one could learn that out of every thousand 
newborn Eskimos almost one-fifth die in childhood--10 times more 
than among the white residents of Ontario. During past years the 
standard of living of white Canadians has risen higher and 
higher, but as for Eskimos...." 
  In parting Rytkheu asked Mary to write her address down in 
his notebook. After her name Mary wrote W-3-244. 
  "Is that your postal address?" Yuriy Sergeyevich tried to 
clarify. 
  "No," answered Mary, "that is my number." It turned out 
that, 
for purposes of government statistics, Eskimos of Canada do not 
have first names. This is explained by the fact that Eskimo 
names are too difficult to pronounce and write. Therefore they 
have decided to assign each Eskimo a number. 
  "Western Eskimos have the letter W in front of their name, 
just as I do, and Eastern ones have E. It is easy and simple. We 
in Tiyuktoyuk have carved these numbers on a wooden chip and 
every Eskimo wears this chip on a chain around his neck, next to 
the cross," Mary explained. 
  Some 40,000 people, a whole nation, have been numbered like 
a 
herd of reindeer or a crowd of prisoners in a concentration 
camp. Indeed: "What is in a name?" But here in Leningrad back in 
the 1930's the only faculty of peoples of the Far North in the 
world was opened at the Pedagogical Institute imeni A.I. 
Gertsen, and dozens of generations of humanities specialists 
have trained there, making up the basis of a new national 
intelligentsia. 
  Since the beginning of "perestroyka" this process has slowed 
up considerably as, incidentally, have all the other processes 
related to the socioeconomic position of indigenous and 
immigrant residents of Chukotka. And the apogee of plundering 
has been reached. The prolonged illness of this region's economy 
is threatening to come to an abrupt end. The more gold, fish, 
pelts, and other assets the state structures and private 
entrepreneurs take out of this land, the worse the life of its 
inhabitants become, year after year. 
  Back four years ago the shortage of goods from Magadan 
Oblast, and hence above all from Chukotka, amounted to 54 
million rubles [R] (not the present "wooden" ones, but the 
former full-value "Union" ones), of which R42 million were for 
food. Each year here they obtain practically no meat, potatoes, 
vegetables, or fruits. During the last navigation period they 
shipped in barely 20 percent of the Northern "food basket." And 
what else can be expected when a state, torn apart by political 
and ethnic conflicts, bled dry by hyperinflation and a 
catastrophic drop in production, is not able to feed its own 
citizens even on the Mainland. 
  Everything extracted on Chukotka goes for export--to be 
sold. 
And what is received in exchange? Coupons for sugar, alcohol, 
and condensed milk. Do you want more food products and of better 
quality? Go to the commercial stores where, what with the higher 
costs of fuel, payment for energy sources, and the disappearance 
of the paper ruble, prices are such that you would not dream 
about them in a terrible nightmare. And these mountain hicks can 
now take anything they want from commerce. Oranges, tangerines, 
raisins, unlimited alcohol.... 
  "How do they get there," I naively asked the people with 
whom 
I was talking, "if this is a special zone and even someone on a 
business trip has to present a special permit from the organs of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs in their place of residence?" 
  "Very simple. At some point a person has gone to vacation in 
the Caucasus, he has been discovered by local merchants and 
offered a deal: You send me an invitation to be a guest and I 
will pay you with both money and goods when I arrive. How can 
you resist the temptation when things are as scarce as they are 
today?"--they explained to me. 
  For a certain amount of time the local authorities were 
still 
hoping for state credit. Today, now that through the efforts of 
the "shock therapists," food prices have shot out of sight, 
there are no hopes for credit. The all-Russian conference on 
problems of survival of the Northern peoples held recently in 
Krasnoyarsk could only sum up the sad results of the current 
destructive credit policy of the powers that be in these regions. 
  "The money that is being allotted is several times less than 
what is needed. The credit moves to the recipients at such rates 
that during this time because of inflation and the complete 
destabilization of the price policy it almost turns into a heap 
of ashes. In some places the navigation period lasts only 10-25 
days. Nobody needs the money arriving on the 26th day--after all 
there are simply no other ways of bringing in supplies." 
  Thus the residents of Chukotka of all 
nationalities--Chukchi, 
Eskimos, Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, who at one time 
were representatives of the unified Soviet brotherhood of 
peoples and now do not know what their citizenship is or who 
needs them--have only one solution: to go begging to their 
relatives in Alaska and its state authorities and ask for help 
or engage in underground barter and recall the good old days 
when the Soviets were still in power here. Perhaps in general 
they should follow the example of Alaska and sell Chukotka to 
Clinton along with Magadan so that they will not bother Moscow, 
the Kremlin, and the White House with their long-standing 
complaints and requests like this? 
  When I was still a child I read a remarkable book by Tikhon 
Semushkin entitled "Alitet Goes to the Mountains," which 
discusses the first years of Soviet power on Chukotka. 
  And he is not the only person whose creative work was linked 
to the Far North and pointed out the path of great Russian 
literature to its talented sons. Semushkin discussed this in a 
conversation with Yuriy Rytkheu: "It seems to me that you and 
Grigoriy Khodzher, and Vladimir Sangi, and Yuvan Shestalov, and 
many others seem to come from the books written by Vatslav 
Serashevskiy, Vladimir Bogoraztan, Vladimir Arsenyev, Gennadiy 
Gor, Nikolay Shudin...." 
  With their help and support during the forties and fifties 
they formed the spiritual environment in which the local 
intelligentsia grew up. Yuriy Rytkheu himself, having become a 
student at the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute imeni A.I. 
Gertsen, began his literary activity with a translation into his 
native language of the works of Russian and Soviet writers, 
received the blessing of A. Tvardovskiy on the pages of NOVYY 
MIR and published more than 30 books with 8 million copies 
translated into 17 languages, not counting the languages of the 
peoples of the Soviet Union. 
  Reflecting on this creative process of mutual enrichment of 
cultures, Yuriy Rytkheu then writes: "It is interesting that 
during those years we did not even think about receiving the 
wealth of another people. It seemed to me at that time that it 
was quite natural and legitimate that the wealth of one people 
belonged to another." 
  It seems to me that a people's cultural wealth essentially 
does not depend on numbers although, on the other hand, it lives 
and develops only as long as its creator thrives in the land. 
  I recall my last meeting in Anadyr with participants in the 
Eskimo people's ensemble "Atasikun." The women take along their 
tambourines and drums and they sing. The pounding of the drums 
and the singing that penetrates to the heart took me back to 
somewhere in ancient times and I got the feeling that I was on a 
seacoast at sunrise. Two boys were dancing and their smooth, 
rhythmic movements told me visually about the awakening of the 
polar night. Then it turned out that I was not mistaken: This 
dance, "Our Land," was handed down from generation to 
generation, and in general everything I saw that evening was not 
simply a concert. People of kindred spirit had gathered here and 
they spoke the language of song and dance and recalled something 
very distant and dear. And along with respect for them and 
delight in their art, in my heart there grew a feeling of 
sadness: Why are there so few of them? 
  Are you alive, "Atasikun?" How are things going for you in 
this time of trouble when the laws of our friendship have been 
trampled into the dirt by highly placed Ivans who do not recall 
their heritage?
