   The outbreak of violence between Mohawk Indians
and police over a white man's golf course is rooted in a dispute
more than two centuries old and is symptomatic of rising native
disgruntlement across Canada.
   ``If you continue to push people to a limit and the federal
government continues to ignore their issues, yes they will
retaliate,'' said Matthew Coon-Come, grand chief of the James Bay
Cree Indians.
   For many Indians on Canadian reserves, life is a continuous
struggle against poverty, alcoholism, poor health services,
non-existent plumbing, primitive sewage disposal and poor drinking
water. Death by injury or poisoning is quadruple the rate for the
rest of Canada and life expectancy is nine years less than that of
a white Canadian.
   Many Indians on reserves want self-government, with the land and
resources to give them a viable economy and an opportunity to
improve their living conditions.
   ``The underlying issue (in the Mohawk dispute) is to try to
settle land claims,'' Coon-Come said. His Cree Indians are fighting
to stop further hydroelectric development in their vast northern
Quebec homeland. ``They have been pushed back to the wall.''
   Shooting broke out Wednesday when police moved in to remove a
roadblock set up by Mohawks at Oka, about 20 miles west of
Montreal. A police officer was shot to death in the confrontation,
but it is still unclear if he was shot by Indians or a fellow
police officer.
   The Mohawks had set up the roadblock to stop the municipality of
Oka from expanding a golf course to include land the Indians claim.
   Robert Mainville, a lawyer whose firm represents Indian bands
across Canada, blamed inaction by the federal government for the
violence.
   ``You have this little municipality dialoguing with natives
instead of the federal government, and some policeman has to get
killed over a nine-hole golf course,'' Mainville said.
   ``What is happening in Oka is only symptomatic,'' he said.
``There is no doubt in my mind that the native population has
undergone a major shift in philosophy and a major shift in
approach. Violence is going to be seen more and more as an
alternative, particularly among young people.
   ``There is a very, very deep sense of frustration among the
young Indians of Canada. Basically, they feel they are being
short-changed. They want action and they are not seeing any on the
part of the federal government.''
   There are about 450,000 registered Indians in Canada and 33,000
Eskimos. Their 2,234 reserves cover 6.4 million acres.
   A renewed sense of pride emerged for many last month when
Manitoba legislator Elijah Harper, a Cree Indian, helped defeat a
constitutional amendment that would have recognized Quebec as a
``distinct society.''
   Harper and other Indians said Canadian Indians also have a
distinct society, but they are not mentioned in the constitution.
Holding an eagle feather in his hand, Harper solemnly said ``no''
each time Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon tried to introduce the
measure into the provincial legislature for ratification.
   The measure failed when Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells refused
to bring it to a vote, but Harper's action helped contribute to its
defeat.
   ``For the first time, the native population saw they had a
chance to show real political muscle,'' Mainville said. ``It's the
only time they have ever had the opportunity to do that in Canada.''
   In Canada, as in the United States, Indians were regularly
pushed from their land by white settlers, and sometimes cheated out
of land in treaties and agreements with the government or business.
   Indian bands in Canada have filed dozens of land claims with
federal and provincial governments.
   As the Mohawks confronted civil authorities Oka, the Haida of
British Columbia protested what they said was a violation of their
fisheries management plan by several commercial sport fishing
lodges. And in the Northwest Territories, the Dene were considering
a proposed land agreement involving $500 million.
