FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Meredith Monk - Music Theatre

In the broad church of American minimalism, Meredith Monk is a distinctive
and refreshingly unpretentious voice. While the music of many of her
contemporaries has become grandiose and self-regarding, Monk has patiently
and quietly cultivated her own furrow, crossing and recrossing the
boundaries between music, dance and theatre, developing her pieces out of
the simplest vocal ideas and the most painstaking preparation.
In Houston last year Monk unveiled her most ambitious piece to date - the
three-act opera Atlas, which Max Loppert welcomed warmly on this page. The
performers brought together for that production are now touring Britain as
the Meredith Monk Vocal Ensemble, offering an hour-long concert version of
Atlas with the instrumental scoring boiled down to a pair of electronic
keyboards and an assortment of arcane percussion.
A concert performance of such a work, however witty and musically expert, is
necessarily a second best. In Monk's world the symbiosis between sound and
gesture is a totally intimate one; each depends on the other for meaning and
context. A sequence of non-verbal numbers, beautifully patterned,
attractively homespun, cannot sustain the dramatic weight it requires. The
elegant vocalise (not unlike early Laurie Anderson, without all the
electronic hardware) can be enjoyed in vacuo, but despite Monk's own
introductions to the excerpts from each act, the sense of these numbers from
Atlas building into something much more substantial was hard to imagine.
The programme begins with a sample of a theatre piece from 1990, Facing
North, Monk's celebration of the Canadian Arctic. It is a straightforward
two-hander, and the four extracts given here by Monk herself and Robert Een
suggested a delicate warm-hearted study, accumulating its patterns and tags
from Inuit melodies and spicing them with a modicum of gesture; the folksy
side of Monk is never far from the surface, yet it rarely cloys or becomes
too cosy.
