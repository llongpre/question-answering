   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
Saturday she'll do some ``vigorous batting'' at the seven-nation
economic summit, and aides said it will include pushing for ``farm
subsidy disarmament'' and debt relief for the poorest African
countries.
   At a ceremony in the paneled library of Toronto's Osgoode Hall
within hours of her arrival, Mrs. Thatcher was made an honorary
``bencher,'' or senior lawyer, of the Law Society of Upper Canada.
   Addressing the black-gowned members of the society, the
profession's governing body in the province of Ontario, Mrs.
Thatcher noted that the summit opening Sunday coincided with an
cricket match between Canadian graduates of Britain's ancient
Oxford and Cambridge universities.
   ``It won't be the only match in town,'' said Mrs. Thatcher. ``I
intend to do some fairly vigorous batting myself on a different
pitch.''
   Earlier, the British spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, said
Mrs. Thatcher hoped the three-day summit would provide impetus for
farm subsidy reform at the December mid-term review in Montreal of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which regulates
international trade.
   Britain is seeking ``farm subsidy disarmament rather than farm
subsidy armament,'' said the Thatcher spokesman.
   ``I don't think we would regard the elimination of all subsidies
by the year 2000 as a practical solution but we ought to be moving
in that direction,'' said the spokesman.
   The United States wants all farm subsidies eliminated by that
date. But West European countries and Japan envisage only reducing
the subsidies.
   The spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher, as well as Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, would also be pushing for joint action on
relieving the debt burden of the poorest African countries.
   ``There should be a fairly specific agreement on African debt in
particular. We're looking for a firm commitment for action,'' he
said.
   Earlier, some Ontario lawyers protested granting Mrs. Thatcher
the ``bencher'' award, citing her refusal to impose tough sanctions
on South Africa.
   Clayton Ruby, one of the ``benchers'' who protested, said,
``This is a leader whose principal accomplishment has been to
frustrate Canada's attempts to end apartheid.''
   Laura Legge, acting head of the 191-year-old society, said only
three of the 44 ``benchers'' had protested, adding: ``Margaret
Thatcher, regardless of one's politics, is a woman who has been
highly successful.''
   In a her acceptance speech, Mrs. Thatcher said the right to live
under the rule of law will be the test of the Soviet Union's policy
of glasnost or openness.
   ``That will be the key test of whether the changes we are seeing
in the Communist societies are a true step toward democracy,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher is the 13th honorary ``bencher'' in the society's
history. They include Elizabeth, mother of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II, and former Canadian Governor General Roland Michener.
   Britain is a major South African trading partner. Mrs. Thatcher
has refused to impose embargoes, saying they would hurt the black
majority most, encourage white resistance to change and cost jobs
in Britain and South Africa.
   Canada, which had scant economic ties with South Africa, has
been a leading proponent of tough measures by the Commonwealth, the
48-nation association of Britain and its former colonies.
   Earlier, Canadian officials and fur trappers lauded a British
decision not to insist fur coats carry warnings that the animals
may have been cruelly trapped.
   The government proposal, drawn up under pressure from
animal-rights activists, would have made retailers and
manufacturers put the labels in wild fox and lynx coats, but not in
minks.
   ``It is an especially Canadian victory _ kids, teachers,
parliamentarians got behind the trappers and native people and
brought political pressure to the highest level in Britain,'' said
Canadian Fur Institute spokesman Kirk Smith in an interview with
Toronto's Globe and Mail.
   The fur industry employs 100,000 Canadians, about half of them
native Indians and Inuit, and is worth more than $400 million a
year.
   Mrs. Thatcher appeared likely to discuss with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney a lucrative $10 billion contract to sell
Canada 10-12 nuclear-powered submarines, which France is also
trying to win. Mulroney is also hosting French President Francois
Mitterrand at the summit.
   Britain is seeking to sell the Canadians its Trafalgar-class
submarine, built with U.S. technology.
   Under an Anglo-American agreement, Britain must get U.S.
permission to pass on the technology to a third country. President
Reagan said last month he would not object, but Congress still must
give its approval.
   France would sell Canada its smaller, and cheaper, Rubis
Amethyste submarine, built entirely with French technology.
