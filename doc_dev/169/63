   The Senate Energy Committee moved to consider opening an Alaskan wildlife refuge to oil development and approved a bill to extend restrictions on selling stock in Alaskan native corporations. 

   Chairman Bennett Johnston (D., La.) said more than two-thirds of the 19 committee members told him they oppose deferring to the next Congress a decision on whether to lease the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, situated on Alaska's North Slope. 
He scheduled a hearing Oct. 13 on a bill to open the refuge. 
And he said he plans to have the committee approve a bill by year's end and bring it to the Senate floor early next year. 

   The decision buoys the hopes of the oil industry, backed by the Reagan administration, of winning access to the refuge during this Congress. 
But the House Interior Committee is moving more slowly. 
Its chairman, Rep. Morris Udall (D., Ariz.), is sponsoring a bill that would bar oil development by conferring wilderness status on the refuge, which oil men call the most promising field in North America. 

   The native corporation bill would extend past 1991 -- when it was due to expire -- the legal barrier that prohibits Alaskan Indians and Eskimos from selling their stock in native corporations. 
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Frank Murkowski (R., Alaska), generally would extend the barrier indefinitely, but would permit the native corporations to lift the restriction by shareholder vote. 
A similar bill has been approved by the House. 

   A 1971 federal law created the corporations to hold assets conferred on Alaskan natives in exchange for terminating their broad claims to lands in the state. 
The 13 regional corporations and scores of village corporations selected about 40 million acres of land and received almost $1 billion. 
A few have prospered by exploiting timber, oil and gas, or other natural resources. 
But many have exhausted their finances in legal battles and unwise investments. 

   The original legislation barred sale of stock in the corporations for 20 years. 
Native groups worry that Eskimos and Indians could lose their lands in corporate takeovers when this term expires in 1991. 

   The bill approved yesterday also would authorize the regional corporations to issue stock to Alaskan natives born after Dec. 18, 1971, when the original bill closed the rolls for shareholders. 
Native groups complain that the restriction has divided families into shareholders and non-shareholders without justification. 

   Senators said the bill is intended to be neutral regarding the controversial issue of whether Alaskan natives can assert tribal sovereignty over the corporation lands. 

   Meanwhile, the House Interior Committee approved 24-16 a bill that would inject competitive bidding into the leasing of onshore federal lands that aren't known to hold oil or gas. 
Currently, such lands are leased without competition, mostly by lottery. 
Critics have charged that this has allowed some oil companies to get valuable oil deposits on federal lands too cheaply. 

   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Nick Rahall (D., W.Va.), would require the Interior Department to offer such land in oral competitive bidding. 
If bids didn't reach $2 an acre, the land would be leased to the first applicant who sought it. 
The Senate Energy Committee has approved similar legislation.
