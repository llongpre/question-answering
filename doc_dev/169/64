   Four Canadians and nine Soviets set
off today on an icy, 1,073-mile ski journey over the North Pole,
from the northernmost point of the Soviet Union to Canada.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the cross-country skiers waved
goodbye to observers at Cape Arctic on the northern tip of
Severnaya Zemlya and headed north in single file. The expedition is
expected to take more than three months.
   Led by Dmitri Shparo, the group planned to make its way from
this northern extreme of the Soviet archipelago, known simply as
``Northern Land,'' across the pole and to Cape Columbia in the
Canadian Artic.
   The joint expedition was originally planned for 1980, but the
Canadians backed out when Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan's
civil war.
   Shparo, 46, led a Soviet polar ski trek in 1979, and the head of
the Canadian team, 28-year-old Richard Weber of Old Chesea,
Ontario, skied the Cape Columbia-North Pole segment in 1986. This
will be the first transcontinental ski trek.
   ``The most interesting part for me will be the social factor of
being in a very small tent with a large number of people for a very
long time,'' Weber told reporters who visited the ski team's
headquarters in Dickson, the Soviet Arctic Circle settlement that
is the northernmost city in the world.
   Canadian teammate Laurie Dexter, an Anglican minister from Fort
Smith, Northwest Territories, said the tent is about 15 feet square.
   ``There are inevitably frayed nerves and tensions, but all of us
are experienced enough and mature enough to let those things pass
and get on with the expedition,'' he said.
   Shparo said his biggest fears about the journey are thin ice at
the start and finish and encounters with open water caused by
drifting ice floes.
   ``Last time, Vasily had to swim twice, and the second time the
temperature was minus 30 degrees,'' Shparo said, referring to
Vasily Shishkarev, a member of the 1979 Soviet expedition and a
radio operator on this trek.
   The skiers will be equipped with rubber rafts, and the Soviets
will be carrying hunting rifles in case they run into dangerous
wildife.
   They plan to maintain radio contact with three polar weather
stations that can relay distress calls to Dickson. Should a medical
emergency develop, or an accident occur, an Aeroflot plane can be
summoned, weather permitting, Shparo said.
   The ski team includes two doctors, Max Buxton of Calabogie,
Ontario, and Mikhail Malakhov of Moscow.
   Malakhov is responsible for carrying out medical experiments on
his teammates to help doctors understand the effects of extreme
weather conditions on the human body.
   Yuri Khmelevsky, the chief researcher on the expedition, is
looking for a second magnetic pole.
   He explained in an interview at expedition headquarters that
strong magnetic pulls have been recorded by ships and planes in a
Soviet region below the pole.
   ``If it exists, we will find it on this trip,'' Khmelevsky said.
   The skiers will have supplies delivered to them by plane, but
their packs and equipment weigh up to 95 pounds when fully loaded.
   The expedition itinerary envisions five drops of food and
supplies.
   Other team members include Canadian scientist Chris Holloway,
Soviet cameraman Vladimir Ledenev, radio operator Anatoli Melnikov,
equipment manager Anatoly Fedyakov, photographer Alexander Belyayev
and artist Anatoly Fyodyakov.
   Most of the skiers are using Soviet-made wooden skis.
