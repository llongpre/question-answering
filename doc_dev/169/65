   In 1985, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had to admit that his government had "neither a canoe or a peashooter up north" to defend Canadian sovereignty against encroaching foreign vessels in the vast, icebound waters of the Canadian Arctic. 

   Yesterday, his Conservative government moved to remedy that shortcoming: It said it will order "the world's largest icebreaker" to operate year-round among Arctic islands, enabling better policing of the region. 

   The $320 million (Canadian) ship will be built by Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc., a Canadian shipbuilder, to "the highest performance standards ever required of an icebreaker," John Crosbie, Canadian transport minister, said. 

   The order for the new ship was prompted in part by an incident in August 1985, when the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Sea rammed through the Arctic waters on a supply mission from Greenland to Alaska without asking Canada's permission. 
Enraged Canadians charged that the country's sovereignty was violated. 
Some Canadians also have expressed concern about unauthorized submarine patrols in the Arctic region. 

   Arctic sovereignty touches "deep emotions in this country," Mr. Crosbie said. 
He said that the government has to give "high priority" to its assertions of sovereignty over land and water in the area. 
He didn't say what action the new icebreaker might take to deal with an intruder. 

   The U.S. government recognizes Canada's sovereignty over the 18,187 Arctic islands but disputes Canada's claims that the waters also are Canadian. 
Washington long has asserted that the Northwest Passage through the Arctic islands is an international waterway. 
Washington has argued that if it recognizes Canadian sovereignty over the Arctic waterways, it will encourage similar demands from other coastal countries, potentially hampering the movement of U.S. vessels around the world. 
The two countries are trying to resolve their differences. 

   Mr. Crosbie said, "Canada's effective control over waters of the Arctic archipelago will be greatly enhanced" by the new icebreaker. 
The ship is rated as class 8, which means it can plow through ice with a thickness of as much as eight feet at a slow speed of about three knots. 
When it rams, it will be able to break through much thicker ice, said Henry Walsh, president of the Canadian Shipbuilding &amp; Ship Repairing Association, a trade group. 

   The planned icebreaker will be 636 feet long and 105 feet wide. 
It will have a draft of 39 feet and a propulsion power rating of 88,000 horsepower. 
It will carry three helicopters. 
Canadian officials said it will be substantially larger than two of the largest icebreakers in service, the Soviet Union's Lenin icebreaker and the U.S. Polar Sea. 

   Versatile Pacific Shipyards is a subsidiary of Versatile Corp., an industrial company based in Vancouver. 
Versatile's shares closed at $1.05 on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, up 22 cents on news of the planned government order. 

   The government said it will provide as much as $13 million of loan insurance to Versatile Pacific to assist the company in its negotiations for financing for the project. 

   Peter Saunders, Versatile Corp. chairman, said that the company has received "a number of unsolicited" proposals from companies interested in taking over Versatile Pacific. 
But he said Versatile doesn't intend to sell the shipyard. 
The parent, which posted heavy losses in the past two years, recently sold some operations, including its farm-equipment subsidiary. 

   The government has sent Versatile Pacific a letter setting out financial and technical conditions to be met by the company in order for contract negotiations to proceed. 
Construction of the ship is to be completed in 1992.
