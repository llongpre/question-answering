   BCE Inc. said it agreed to buy a telephone utility serving Canada's northwest region from Canadian National Railways, the Canadian government-owned railway company, for 140 Canadian dollars (US$113 million). 

   The purchase of the utility, Northwestel Inc., also will involve the assumption of C$56 million in long-term debt. 
The sale is expected to close by year-end. 

   With the purchase of Northwestel, BCE will control telephone service across the Canadian Arctic. 
Its wholly owned unit, Bell Canada, serves the eastern Northwest Territories. 
Northwestel serves Yukon territory, northern British Columbia and the western Northwest Territories. 
BCE is a holding company with interests in telecommunications, energy, printing and real estate. 

   This is the second telephone company that Canadian National agreed to sell to BCE or an affiliate this month. 
Last week, it agreed to sell Terra Nova Telecommunications Inc. to Newfoundland Telephone Co., which is controlled indirectly by BCE.
