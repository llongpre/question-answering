   Two young whales trapped by ice
tentatively tested a narrow escape route to open water Sunday that
was being carved with chain saws by Eskimos who ordinarily hunt
whales.
   A National Guard helicopter hammered at the ice off Alaska's
northern coast with a 5-ton chunk of concrete. But the whales were
more than three miles from a strech of open water, with a massive
ice ridge in between and a wind shift threatening to push ice
around them and trap them further.
   Rescuers said that even if everything went as planned, it would
be at least Wednesday night before they could get the whales as far
as the ridge.
   As crews concentrated on coaxing the whales to freedom, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asked for help from
two Soviet icebreakers.
   The icebreakers, Admiral Makorov and Vladimir Arseniev, however,
need about 39 feet of water to operate, the Soviet news agency TASS
reported. The whales are trapped in an area where water depth
varies from 12 to 25 feet.
   NOAA Rear Admiral Sigmund R. Petersen, director of the Pacific
Marine Center in Seattle, said even if the icebreakers cannot reach
the whales, they could help clear a path to the first opening, or
lead, from open water 200 miles away.
   Petersen said that depending on ice conditions, the ships could
reach Barrow by noon Tuesday.
   While high-technology equipment poured into Barrow during the
weekend, Eskimos using chain saws and their strong backs made the
most progress at freeing the California gray whales from a tiny
breathing hole.
   About two dozen natives hacked 34 breathing holes Saturday, for
a total of about 60 holes extending more than 1{ miles from where
three whales were stranded by moving ice about two weeks ago before
they could migrate south.
   The smallest and youngest of the whales, named Bone, disappeared
Friday night and was presumed dead.
   Just as the tedious hole-cutting hit its stride, the whales
balked, advancing only a few hundred feet past a large opening
where they spent Friday night and most of Saturday.
   Biologists said the animals had gone back to earlier breathing
holes, sometimes breaking up to 2 inches of ice to surface. They
said that was a good sign because the marine mammals still must
negotiate 200 miles of ice before hitting open water if they are
freed.
   ``If they know they are capable of doing that, they may continue
doing so,'' said biologist Jim Harvey.
   ``Basically, we have to condition them that their best chance of
survival is to move ahead to new holes,'' Harvey said.
   He said rescuers planned to begin filling or covering the holes
behind the whales to force them along the desired path.
   Rescuers said they feared the whales were spooked by an
underwater shoal. North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll said
most of the water in the area is about 20 feet deep, compared to
only 12 or 13 feet of water in the shoal.
   ``You figure two feet of ice and five feet of whale, and that
doesn't leave them too much room to swim,'' Carroll said. ``I don't
blame them for not wanting to go through there.''
   Whaling captain Arnold Brower, whose crew used donated chain
saws to help free the animals, was frustrated by the whales'
reluctance.
   ``If we move them, then I'll call it progress,'' Brower said,
leaning down to push the snout of a surfacing whale in the
direction he wanted it to go.
   Ron Morris, a biologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said sonar would be used to see if
there is an easy way around the shoal.
   The surviving whales appeared to be healthy, immature whales
estimated at 27 to 35 feet long, said David Withrow of the Marine
Mammal Institute in Seattle. He said one apparently was a yearling
and the other was 2 to 3 years old.
   Rescuers worked in the dark using portable lights, snowmobile
headlights and de-icing equipment dubbed ``the bubblers'' to keep
the holes open ahead of the whales.
   The Skycrane helicopter on Saturday used its concrete plunger to
probe the ridge, a jumble of ice blocks as big as a house, but the
battering ram seldom penetrated. The ridge formed by colliding ice
masses is several hundred yards wide.
   Of additional concern was a shift in the wind, which Eskimo
hunters said could turn the area where the whales were trapped into
an impassable jumble of ice rubble.
   NOAA spokesman Brian Gorman in Washington, D.C., said the agency
asked for the Soviet icebreakers and they were dispatched under a
1976 cooperative environmental agreement with the Soviet Union.
   He said the rescue effort also involves use of ``some of our own
NOAA satellites to take ice pictures. We are relaying that
information to the Soviets to assist them in determining the most
expeditious route.''
   Heavy ice in the Arctic Ocean earlier disabled two Canadian
icebreakers and the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Star.
   The latest piece of high technology to be thrown into the battle
is a pontoon-mounted vehicle known as an Archimedes screw, which
pulls itself along by augers that eat into the ice.
   While marine biologists called the whales Bone, Crossbeak and
Bonnet, the Eskimos have named the two survivors Siku, or ice, and
Putu, ice hole. The vanished whale they named Knik, one of 28
Eskimo words for snowflake.
   The young whales' lack of experience apparently led them farther
north than the endangered California gray whales normally go, and
caused them to stay too long before starting their annual migration
to the warm water off Mexico's Baja California, Withrow said.
   Harvey and Withrow said the whales have a reasonable chance of
survival if they can be freed within a week.
   Harvey said the whales condition Sunday appeared stable, but
that a wound on the snout of the larger whale appeared worse than
before.
   The rescue effort had attracted so many spectators and news
teams that a police officer was stationed out on the ice to direct
traffic.
   A giant Air Force C5-A cargo plane sent in with fresh equipment
took up so much ground space at Barrow's airport that a commercial
flight didn't have room to land.
