   A 60-day, 1,200-mile ski and dog sled
trek from Siberia to Alaska will be more celebration than
exploration for a dozen U.S. and Soviet adventurers setting out this
weekend.
   Aside from cold-weather research, the primary object of the
Bering Bridge Expedition across seldom-visited sections of the
Soviet Far East and arctic Alaska is good will, said Paul Schurke,
33, of Ely, Minn., who describes the trip as adventure diplomacy.
   ``My pocket is full of cross-flagged (U.S.-Soviet) pins,''
Schurke said. ``We'll be leaving a full-sized American flag in each
Soviet village; a Soviet flag in each Alaska village.''
   The expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common
cultural heritage of the indigenous population of the Bering region,
Schurke said.
   Some of the team members have relatives on opposite sides of the
border, and it is hoped the trek will result in a relaxation of
rules barring visits by natives _ some of whom live within 2{ miles
of one another on islands in the Bering Strait, separated only by
sea ice and Cold War politics.
   The six-member U.S. team arrived in this Siberian city of 16,000
Wednesday, after two weather delays.
   They joined their six Soviet counterparts for a news conference,
a VIP dinner and the beginning of several days of medical
experiments. It was the first visit in decades by Americans to this
treeless city built of locally produced concrete blocks set atop
permafrost.
   Three Soviets and three Americans on the journey are natives, and
speak several local dialects including Yupik, a language common to
Eskimos in both countries.
   The trek across ancient trade and migration routes up the
Siberian side of the Bering Strait and down the Alaskan side is to
stop in 16 villages in the Chukotka district of Siberia and 14 in
Alaska, organizers said. It will end about April 1 in Kotzebue,
Alaska, just above the Arctic Circle and about 550 miles northwest
of Anchorage.
   ``Youth groups have arranged for festivities which will include
receptions and sharing of native dances and, hopefully, some native
foods,'' Schurke said.
   ``We expect we will come up with some sort of goodwill ceremony
that we'll stick with for each of our visits, and then let it roll
spontaneously.''
   Negotiations began a week ago between the U.S. State Department
and the Soviets on re-opening the border closed by the Soviets
during the Berlin blockade in 1948. Schurke said he hoped a treaty
might be ready for signing as early as April 1 on the Bering Sea ice.
   ``What marks this trip is the sheer volume of human contact,''
said Schurke, veteran of an unsupplied sled dog expedition to the
North Pole in 1986. ``The populations of the villages we will be
visiting totals close to 50,000.''
   Most of the journey will be on relatively smooth coastal ice,
with detours around pressure ridges and open water. There was
concern about huge stretches of open water reported near the U.S.
island of Little Diomede and the Soviet island of Big Diomede which
flank the International Dateline and the border dividing the two
countries.
   ``There is big water in the Bering Straits,'' said Dimitri
Shparo, the Soviet co-leader of the expedition who was speaking
through an interpreter. ``That could force us to detour several
hundred miles north to find ice.
   ``The farther we go into March, the more the sun will work on the
ice,'' the 47-year-old polar explorer said. ``The (ocean) current
moving through those two islands also is fierce.''
   The expedition is only the latest attempt to warm the climate in
superpower relations at the point where the nations are closest.
   U.S. and Soviet officials and Eskimos flew from Nome to the
Siberian port of Provideniya for a one-day visit last spring, and a
group of Soviets spent the last week of February in Alaska for talks
with government and industry leaders.
