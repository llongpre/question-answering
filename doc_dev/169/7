   The two whales that captured the world's attention
off Alaska should have been eaten instead of freed from the ice, an
Eskimo activist says.
   ``In my mind, there's something wrong to save these two whales
while you are destroying the life of the human beings of the
North,'' Aqqaluk Lynge, of the Greenland office of the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference, said Friday at a news conference that
concluded a three-day meeting on arctic cooperation.
   ``To my mind it's a degradation of human values,'' he said.
   The native peoples of the Arctic region generally prefer the term
Inuit to Eskimo.
   The California gray whales, stranded in arctic ice for nearly
three weeks, apparently swam to freedom Friday, ending a
million-dollar rescue effort that involved Soviet icebreakers,
American scientists and Eskimo volunteers who cut holes in the ice
with chain saws.
   Lynge noted the enormous resources devoted to freeing the whales
and said, ``It's better to eat them.''
   The activist said environmentalists' campaigns against
fur-trapping and seal hunting in the arctic have devastated
traditional cultures in the region.
   The conference, sponsored by the government-affiliated Canadian
Institute for International Peace and Security and the
Toronto-based, private Science for Peace, brought together native
activists as well as scientists and academics on arctic issues.
   Organizers of the International Conference on Arctic Cooperation
said the participation among all arctic nations, including the
Soviet Union, was remarkable.
   Arkady Cherkasov, a specialist in arctic economics from the
Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of the USA and Canada, said
the campaign to save the two whales may have helped because of the
attention focused on the region's problems.
   ``It's a good thing,'' he said. ``But still there are many other
problems to solve in the north.''
   Cherkasov also said the Yuit people of the Soviet Arctic might be
able to join the Inuit Interpolar Conference. A representative of
the Yuits, who have traveled only rarely outside the Soviet Union,
was in Toronto for the conference.
   The interpolar conference claims to represent the 120,000 Inuit
people from Alaska, Canada and Greenland.
   But Cherkasov said Soviet participation in such a group could be
difficult because more than 25 different native groups live in the
Soviet Arctic.
   The 70 participants were from eight arctic countries, including
Canada, the Soviet Union, the United States, Denmark (Greenland),
Iceland, Sweden, Finland and Norway.
   Although they failed to agree on a final resolution, organizer
Franklyn Griffiths of the University of Toronto said the conference
produced thinking ``about what you can do up there together. Action
comes later.''
   Among the topics discussed were public health problems in the
arctic region, the results of industrialization, the environment and
the greenhouse effect, militarization and science.
   ``Each polar state now faces broadly similar problems preserving
the cultures and way of life of its indigenous peoples,'' the
conference's preliminary statement said.
   ``While the need for international civil cooperation on Arctic
environmental, scientific, social and other matters of common
concern has grown, it is constrained by military-strategic
conflict.''
