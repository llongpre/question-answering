   A Canadian Forces fighter jet that was
to intercept a U.S. cruise missile crashed shortly after takeoff on
Monday, military officials said.
   CBC-TV reported the single-seat CF-18 plane exploded in flight
and the pilot was killed. However, Maj. Jan Martinsen, spokesman
for the Cold Lake base, said the pilot's fate was unknown.
   The crash occurred near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, shortly
after the plane took off at 8:02 a.m., Martinsen said.
   The cruise flight was not affected and the cigar-shaped missile,
about the length of a full-size car, landed on schedule almost four
hours later on the Primrose Lake air weapons range surrounding Cold
Lake.
   It traveled 1,365 miles from the Beaufort Sea, over the
Mackenzie Valley, British Columbia and Alberta to Primrose,
Martinsen said.
   She said the cause of the CF-18 crash is not known. ``That's for
a board of inquiry to determine,'' she added.
   The Canadian Press identified the pilot as Capt. Richard Corver
of Toronto, quoting Martinsen as saying Corver had flown CF-18
fighter planes for three years.
   Searchers at the site found no sign of the pilot near the
fuselage, which was scattered over a snow-covered area 3 miles east
of the airport runway at Inuvik, in the Northwest Territories.
   ``This investigation will be very difficult because it's dark,
it's very cold and it's a very difficult area to reach,'' said
Martinsen. The only access to the area is by helicopter or
snowmobile.
   The CF-18 was part of the Canadian Forces team participating in
the 15th test of the cruise missile over Canada. The aircraft and
other planes were to hunt down and simulate shooting the missile.
   This was the first time a fighter plane had crashed in testing
of the cruise missile.
   The unarmed U.S. cruise missile was released from a B-52 bomber
over the Canadian Arctic.
   The test was the 15th over Canada's northwest since the Canadian
and U.S. governments signed an agreement in 1983. The CF-18s were
included in the military exercises for the first time last year.
   Residents of Inuvik said the crash area is dotted with lakes and
lightly wooded with spruce and pine trees. Temperatures in the area
hover around 30 degrees below zero.
