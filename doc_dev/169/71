   This community above the Arctic Circle,
the northernmost in the United States, hardly qualifies as a
popular fall destination with its below-zero weather, fog and the
occasional polar bear roaming the streets.
   But the drama of efforts to free three ice-trapped whales has
turned the Eskimo village into a boom town.
   ``It feels like this is Grand Central station,'' said Fran Tate,
owner of Pepe's North of the Border Restaurant, where business in
the past week has been up 20 percent.
   Hordes of journalists from Australia to New York have come to
report on the plight of the California gray whales, imprisoned
under Arctic Ocean ice about 13 miles northeast of here for more
than two weeks. One of the whales disappeared under the ice Friday
and was presumed dead.
   Residents of this whaling village of about 2,200 people are more
accustomed to visits from polar bears that occasionally wander in
off the ice pack. But they are taking the attention and the demands
of the media in stride.
   ``We've become something of a nerve center,'' said Ron Hewitt,
manager of the Top of the World Hotel.
   The 40-room hotel has been fully booked since Oct. 16, and its
switchboard has been lit up constantly with calls from people
seeking rooms and information about the whales.
   Another 16-room hotel and all 60 rooms at the former Naval
Arctic Research Laboratory also were filled, Hewitt said.
   ``Right now, we're taking the names of people in town who have
space, and we're referring callers to them,'' Hewitt said. ``It's
all part of the community's response, but we're glad to do it.''
   The impact has spread far beyond the hotels.
   A special bank of phones was installed in the North Slope
Borough assembly's chambers Thursday to improve communications,
said Marie Adams of the borough's information liaison office.
   Phone lines in the borough's search-and-rescue operations center
had gotten so clogged the rescue squad couldn't have received
emergency calls had there been any, Adams said.
   And there isn't a rental vehicle left in town. Enterprising
natives are hitching sleds to their snowmobiles to haul reporters,
photographers and TV crews across the ice to view the whales.
   Some reporters went to the operations center to hitch rides to
the ice pack on borough and military helicopters involved in the
rescue effort, but the center was declared off-limits.
   Ill-equipped visitors, unfamiliar with the harsh Arctic
conditions, have created a run on insulated boots, stocking caps,
mittens and other cold-weather gear.
   Journalists also like to eat well.
   ``They're bigger spenders because they're on expense accounts,''
said Tate, who bills her establishment as ``the farthest North
Mexican restaurant.''
   Asked if she thought the media response was out of proportion to
the situation, Tate said, ``Well, maybe just a little bit. But
what's wrong with caring?''
   Tate said the coverage will show the compassion the Eskimos feel
for whales despite their hunting heritage. The Eskimos hunt bowhead
whales, not California grays.
