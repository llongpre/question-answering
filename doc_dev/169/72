   A constitutional agreement aimed at keeping
French-speaking Quebec in the Canadian federation was on the brink
of death Thursday, blocked in two provinces as the deadline for
passage approached.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney flew to St. John's, Newfoundland,
one of the holdouts, in an effort to save the agreement, which must
be ratified by all 10 provinces by midnight Saturday or expire. He
warned that sinking the accord could prompt another referendum in
Quebec _ this time by the separatists.
   Troubles loomed too in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where a legislator
has managed to block debate for a week on the agreement.
   Eight of the provinces favor the Meech Lake accord, as it is
called, and Mulroney is one of the most ardent supporters of the
agreement.
   In a restrained but tough address, Mulroney confronted
Newfoundland's 52-seat legislature with the possibility of
constitutional paralysis, economic problems and increased support
for the separatist cause.
   ``On that night, when you're sitting there with your family and
your children, one thought is going to go through your mind: do you
mean to tell me that we could have avoided all of this for Meech
Lake?'' Mulroney said.
   ``If that night were ever to come, the terms of Meech Lake are
going to look very, very reasonable indeed to every member of this
House of Assembly and every house of assembly across Canada.''
   One hour after Mulroney concluded his address, a bomb threat
forced a 45-minute evacuation of the legislature.
   The five-point agreement would designate Quebec a ``distinct
society,'' something the Supreme Court would be obliged to consider
when looking at specific laws challenged under the constitution.
   The Meech Lake agreement, first approved by the prime minister
and the premiers of the provinces in 1987, is aimed at winning
Quebec's signature on Canada's 1982 constitution. At that time, the
ministers set a three-year deadline for approval by the Parliament
and legislatures.
   In the interim, governments changed in three of the provinces _
Manitoba, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick _ and the premiers
reneged on the signatures of their predecessors.
   In early June, Mulroney called the premiers to Ottawa where they
spent a week in intense private meetings. They agreed to pass the
original accord as it is. New Brunswick passed it last week.
   Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells put the agreement up for a vote
in his legislature, where it is still being debated.
   The biggest challenge has come from Manitoba. Legislator Elijah
Harper, who as a Cree is the only Indian in the provincial
legislature, has said he will kill Meech Lake because it does not
take native rights into consideration.
   Many of the Indians and Inuit leaders of Canada believe their
societies are as distinct as Quebec's, and they also want to be
recognized in the constitution.
   Manitoba law requires public hearings before a vote on
constitutional amendments, and procedural delays introduced by
Harper have pushed debate back so far that it may be impossible to
pass the measure before the deadline.
   For many Quebecois in Montreal, Canada's second-largest city,
the arguments have worn thin and the endless debate over a document
thought signed and sealed in 1987 has led to widespread cynicism
and a rise in nationalist feelings.
   A poll published Thursday in the French-language newspaper La
Presse indicated that 57 percent of Quebecois favor sovereignty, up
slightly from 56 percent in March.
   But, unlike a decade ago when a referendum was held by the
separatist Parti Quebecois to determine the future of the province,
passion is missing.
   ``I think people have accepted that it (Meech Lake) won't pass
with a shrug,'' said Robert Gagnon, a computer systems specialist
for a Montreal insurance company.
   An exception to that feeling came from cabbie Roger Solari.
Asked about independence for Quebec, he responded with a vigorous
``Ah, oui!'' slapping the steering wheel for emphasis. ``They don't
want us. We're better off independent.''
   Premier Robert Bourassa has categorically rejected suggestions
for extending the Saturday deadline. ``There will be a profound
disappointment, sadness and much disillusionment in Quebec,'' he
said.
   Jean Chretien, leading candidate for the leadership of the
opposition Liberal Party, told the party's congress in Calgary that
failure of Meech Lake would not necessarily mean a breakup of
Canada.
   But Premier Frank McKenna of New Brunswick, once a strong
opponent of Meech Lake, predicted a wave of intolerance across
Canada if the deal fails.
   ``We will see waves of hatred taking place across our beloved
land,'' McKenna said. ``There will be alienation, and lots of it,
enough to go around for everyone.''
