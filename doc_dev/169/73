   Willie Kasayulie was 13 when he had to
leave this Eskimo fishing village. It had no high school, and
bright kids like Willie were sent to distant boarding schools.
   Far from family and home, he polished his English, learned to
deal with ignorance about his culture and realized the depth of his
love for the land and his people.
   At 37, Willie Kasayulie is back home, putting the lessons of his
teen-age years to use. As chief of the Yupiit Nation, he leads a
coalition of 19 Yupik Eskimo villages in a battle with state and
federal officials over control of the villages' destiny.
   When Congress settled Alaska natives' land claims in 1971, it
tried to avoid the social ills endured by American Indians in the
lower 48 states. Instead of reservations run by tribal councils, it
set up corporations run by native shareholders. But now Kasayulie
and other native leaders, disappointed by the corporations'
performance, say the tribal way looks better all the time.
   Their efforts to assert tribal sovereignty are opposed by state
and federal officials, who fear that recognition of distinct tribes
in Alaska could split the state into an unmanageable hodgepodge of
independent enclaves.
   But Kasayulie, also a commercial fisherman, says that denying
tribal status is denying a culture its right to govern itself by
its traditions.
   ``They're trying to take away my cultural rights,'' said
Kasayulie. ``I don't want to forget who I am or where my roots are.
We've got our language, our history, and those are as important as
the history of the United States.''
   Akiachak, population 470, tucked among willows on an oxbow turn
of the muddy Kuskokwim River in southwestern Alaska, can be reached
only by boat or airplane in summer, by dog team or snowmobile in
winter.
   Despite its isolation, Akiachak is at the center of a movement
among rural Alaska natives to assert tribal control over education,
law enforcement, taxation, game regulations and other governmental
functions.
   The struggle is waged in legislative halls, courtrooms and the
native villages themselves:
   _ Akiachak residents voted in 1983 to replace their municipal
government with a tribal council. The council now runs the
village's water treatment plant, pays the salaries of three police
officers and levies a 2 percent sales tax. A panel of elders metes
out fines for minor crimes in the village. But the state recognizes
neither council nor panel as legitimate governing bodies.
   _ The Athabascan Indian village of Copper Center announced its
intention to tax the operators of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline,
which passes through traditional hunting grounds near the village.
The case is pending in federal district court.
   _ A non-native family expelled by Tyonek's tribal council sued
the village. A federal district court upheld the village's
sovereign immunity against such suits; an appeal is pending.
   Congress thought it was heading off such conflicts when it
passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971. Hailed as
the most generous settlement ever struck with native Americans, the
act granted Alaska's natives $963 million and 44 million acres in
exchange for dropping aboriginal land claims.
   The land and money were put under control of 12 regional
corporations and 200 village corporations.
   ``Congress said in ANCSA, `Look, the days of reservations are
over. We want you to be good businessmen and be part of the
American economic mainstream,''' said Thomas Morehouse, a
researcher at the University of Alaska's Institute for Social and
Economic Research.
   The law's boosters said the corporations would make money for
Alaska's 70,000 Eskimos, Aleuts and Indians, help develop the
state's resources and assimilate natives into modern society, while
addressing social problems such as alcoholism and suicide.
   In general, the corporations have failed to live up to those
grand expectations.
   Some have thrived, investing wisely and developing resources
such as timber or minerals. Others have foundered _ the regional
Bering Straits Native Corp. is in bankruptcy court, and many do no
more than fill out annual reports.
   But even successful corporations have paid out few dividends.
Alaska natives have received an average of only $800 in dividends
since 1971, said Janie Leask, president of the Alaska Federation of
Natives.
