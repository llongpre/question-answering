   Four Canadian and nine Soviet
skiers set off Thursday under a hazy, primrose-colored Arctic
sunset to cross the North Pole and make a statement about East-West
cooperation.
   The 13 men face not only a 1,073-mile trek, but also must eat
and sleep in the same tent for 100 days.
   The journey got off to a late and rocky start from the snowy
fields of ice floes that link this northernmost tip of the
archipelago known as Severnaya Zemlya _ which means ``Northern
Land'' _ with the polar ice cap.
   Their faith was tested on the eve of thier departure when
expedition leader Dmitri Shparo proposed expanding the Soviet team
to nine members.
   ``It was an 11th-hour decision,'' said Canadian team leader
Richard Weber, revealing some of the uncertainty his countrymen
felt in allowing a further shifting of numbers in favor of the
Soviets. ``But when we sat down, we couldn't come up with any good
reasons why not.''
   Weber and Shparo met with Western and Soviet reporters at a
remote encampment on Sredny Island, 93 miles south of this
departure point.
   Shparo termed the Canadian concession ``magnanimous.''
   Weber said Shparo informed him Wednesday that he didn't want to
cut from the team any of the Soviets who had been in training.
   By morning, which arrives late on the Severnaya Zemlya, spirits
were high and the explorers lumbered through crowded barracks
weighing packs and redistributing gear.
   An Mi-6 helicopter shuttled the skiers and a small group of
journalists to the starting point, a windswept jumble of ice floes
frozen into a single white expanse that stretches 1,240 miles to
the Canadian Arctic.
   The Rev. Laurie Dexter of Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, an
Anglican minister, stood on a snowy ridge overlooking the solid
field that is the Arctic Ocean and called on ``the faith we have in
each other'' to take his fellow skiers safely across the pole and
into a new age of understanding.
   The men, bundled in red suits trimmed with dog fur and sponsors'
logos, sped off at 2:30 p.m. as the sun hung just over the horizon.
   The expedition will continue to Canada's Cape Columbia, with an
arrival scheduled for early June.
   The route has been covered in two parts by members of separate
teams, but this is the first attempt at a transcontinental crossing
of the pole.
   The joint expedition was planned for 1980, but the Canadians
abandoned the attempt when Soviet troops drove into Afghanistan in
December 1979.
   Shparo, 46, led the first Soviet polar ski trek in 1979, and
Weber, 28, of Old Chesea, Ontario, covered the Cape Columbia-North
Pole segment in 1986.
   ``The most interesting part for me will be the social factor of
being in a very small tent with a large number of people for a very
long time,'' Weber told reporters who visited the ski team's
headquarters in Dickson, the Soviet Arctic Circle settlement that
is the northernmost city in the world.
   Dexter said the tent measures about 14.8 feet square.
   ``There are inevitably frayed nerves and tensions, but all of us
are experienced enough and mature enough to let those things pass
and get on with the expedition,'' he said.
