   Two of Canada's biggest oil companies said they are considering an 8.4 billion Canadian dollar (US$7 billion) project to develop natural gas fields in the Canadian Arctic. 

   Esso Resources Canada Ltd., a unit of Toronto-based Imperial Oil Ltd., and Shell Canada Ltd. of Calgary said the project would involve exports of at least six trillion cubic feet of gas to the U.S. over 20 years, possibly beginning in the late 1990s. 
Imperial Oil is 70% owned by Exxon Corp. and Shell Canada is 79% owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, an Anglo-Dutch concern. 
Esso would be joined by certain partners that have a minority interest in its fields. 

   Both companies said they plan to file applications later this summer with Canada's National Energy Board for permission to export the gas. 
U.S. import applications would also be required, but neither company plans to make immediate applications to U.S. regulatory authorities. 

   The Esso-Shell project is similar to gas-development plans from the 1970s that were abandoned in the early 1980s because markets weren't available. 
But Miles Shaw, a spokesman for Esso Resources, said development plans are being revived now, because of expectations that the U.S. will need the gas in the late 1990s, and because it would take about 10 years to complete regulatory and financing arrangements and to construct the project. 

   Mr. Shaw added that it is "too early to say" if the Canadian gas project would have to compete for markets with the proposed $22.5 billion (U.S.) 
Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline, which would transport 2.3 billion cubic feet of gas daily from Prudhoe Bay through Canada to the lower 48 states. 
As previously reported, the U.S. and Canadian sponsors of that project say deliveries could begin in the mid-1990s, but that a decision to proceed with the system is at least two years away. 

   Neil Camarta, manager of oil and gas business development for Shell Canada, estimated that transportation costs for the Canadian gas would be about $1.80 a thousand cubic feet in 1988 U.S. dollars. 
Mr. Camarta said Shell Canada considers the prospects "encouraging," but he added that a "substantial" increase in gas prices is needed to make the project economical. 

   As previously reported, the Alaska Highway gas project's sponsors estimate their transportation costs would be about $3.05 a thousand cubic feet on a comparable basis, or about $4.80 after allowing for inflation. 
Current spot-market prices for natural gas at the wellhead in the U.S. Gulf Coast area are about $1.50 a thousand cubic feet. 

   Mr. Shaw of Esso Resources said the Canadian Arctic natural gas volumes include proposed deliveries of 700 million cubic feet a day from reserves that his company has established at its Taglu field in the Northwest Territories' Mackenzie Delta, and from fields in shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea. 

   Mr. Camarta of Shell Canada said his company would develop a further 120 million to 160 million cubic feet a day from its onshore Niglintgak field in the Mackenzie Delta. 

   The C$8.4 billion cost estimate comprises about C$5.1 billion for a 1,450 mile pipeline to Caroline, Alberta; C$3 billion for field development by Esso and its partners; and C$275 million for Shell Canada's field development, the two companies' spokesmen said. 

   Mr. Shaw said the development project assumes construction of a pipeline with a capacity to carry 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily from the Canadian Arctic to Caroline, where existing facilities would deliver the fuel to U.S. markets. 
Such a pipeline would also allow other companies with gas reserves in the Canadian Arctic to participate in the development, he said.
