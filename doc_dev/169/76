   ``Health has changed,'' said Fernand Filion, an anthropologist
now heading social services in Chisasibi. ``Infant mortality has
been reduced. The Crees live longer. But now they have high blood
pressure, obesity and alcoholism.''
   Adds Charlie Pepabano, executive assistant to Chisasibi Chief
Violet Pachanos: ``The progress was too much. It came too fast and
didn't give us a chance to adapt. We are trying to educate people
that it's here and that we are going to have to live with it.''
   Another blow has been to the country and its wildlife. The land
is fragile. In these northern climes, it takes a tree 100 years to
grow to the size of a man's thigh. Forest fires ruin areas for
generations, disrupting wildlife, even affecting the quality of the
fish, according to Crees.
   Hydro Quebec says the impact on the environment has been
minimal. The company points to the hundreds of environmental
studies and follow-ups carried out by more than 200 scientists and
claims there are no fewer resources, no fewer animals, no fewer
fish in the region than before the project began. In some cases, as
with caribou, numbers are even on the increase.
   Cree hunters and trappers say otherwise. All the best fishing
lakes are flooded, along with many beaver lodges, according to
Chisasibi trapper George Lameboy. Those beaver are gone, he said.
``Now you never see signs of muskrat in the LG2 area,'' he said.
   ``Their studies are geared to insure that they are in conformity
with their plans,'' says Coon-Come. ``There were no totally
independent studies carried out.''
   One of the major critics of the project is the New York-based
National Audubon Society, which says the development is a major
threat to numerous species of shore birds and waterfowl. The
eastern shore of the James Bay is a major staging area for
migratory birds.
   Hydro Quebec, responding to electricity needs, increases the
discharge of water into the James Bay in winter and decreases it in
spring and summer, reversing Mother Nature.
   The only major impact the company will admit to is a serious
rise in the mercury levels in fish from newly flooded reservoirs.
As a result, the Crees no longer can eat certain types of fish from
certain lakes and rivers.
   The mercury occurs naturally in vegetation. When reservoirs are
flooded, bacteria feed on the decomposing organic matter,
transforming the harmless mercury into poisonous methyl mercury.
This in turn gets into the food system by contaminating predator
fish such as pickerel, lake trout and whitefish.
   Hydro Quebec says the lakes and rivers eventually will return to
normal but the estimated time it will take varies from 10 to 30
years.
   Others say all of Hydro Quebec's studies are self-serving.
   Alan Penn, an ecologist who advises the Grand Council of the
Crees of Quebec, said: ``It is information generated by an
organization for its own purposes and not to understand the
functioning of an ecosystem.''
   Penn's biggest criticism is that there is no outside control or
direction of Hydro Quebec's studies and that they are producing
largely useless data.
   The Crees claim they only found out about James Bay development
when it was well under way, after Hydro Quebec began building roads
and other infrastructure. The Indians went to court and won an
injunction, but Hydro got a stay and work went ahead while the
matter languished in court.
   The natives saw it was too late, work had progressed too far,
and decided to make the best deal they could. That deal was the
James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. The 31-chapter accord
covers all aspects of life and development in a 410,000-square-mile
area of northern Quebec.
   In it, the Crees and Inuit agreed to the La Grande River
development under certain conditions. The Crees received an initial
$135 million in cash compensation, which has been invested or used
to create Cree-run businesses such as Cree Construction and Air
Creebec, and more cash in subsequent extensions of the agreement.
   The Crees say future development requires Cree consent, and
they're not giving it.
   Serge Dube, Hydro's counselor on Indian affairs, says the future
development already is conceded in the James Bay and Northern
Quebec Agreement. ``All of the rights for all of the projects are
covered by the agreement,'' Dube says. ``There is no legal ground
to stop it.''
   ``What the project did was wake everybody up,'' says Lameboy.
``We used to think the government would protect us, the government
would not let this happen. Then we woke up to the fact that the
government is pushing this. That they can be the bad guys.
   ``The government is saying the north is open, the sky is the
limit, go help yourself.''
