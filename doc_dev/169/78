   THE KARI-OCA INDIAN VILLAGE, RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE grounds of a mental asylum were the bizarre setting yesterday for the
first official event of the UN Conference on Environment and Development,
better known as the Earth Summit.
Aborigines, inuit (eskimos), North American Indians, tribal Africans and
Amazonian Indians in full paint and feathers gathered together in a mock
Indian village in the grounds of Curicica Mental Hospital on the hills
outside Rio de Janeiro for the first ever World Conference of Indigenous
People, much to the amusement of the inmates.
Most had come by aircraft and car, rejecting the grass huts of the Kari-oca
village built by Indians with authentic materials from the Xingu National
Park, in favour of air-conditioned hotels in the city.
Some 500 Indians from five continents will meet all week to discuss topics
such as biodiversity, intellectual property and sustainable development, to
prepare a document to be presented to Mr Maurice Strong, secretary general
of the Earth Summit.
According to Mr Marcos Terena, a Brazilian Indian chief co-ordinating the
conference, the aim is 'to ensure that indigenous people have a voice' in
the official summit which starts next Wednesday, and are not 'just
considered in folkloric terms'.
Specific concerns include recognition of intellectual property rights for
use of medicinal plants from Indian areas, sovereignty rights and deciding
on a position for the 500th anniversary of the European discovery of the
Americas.
Mr Donald Rocas, an Indian from Costa Rica, says: 'This conference is
fundamental because it deals with all our lives - not just those of
indigenous people but also non-indigenous who need to learn from us how to
look after land and resources crucial for the planet's survival.'
Ms Helen Corbett, who is leading an Aborigine delegation from Australia,
says: 'The main issue for us is sovereignty for aborigines to prevent
destruction of our land and death of our people.'
However, there is doubt over how representative the conference delegates
are. Brazilian Indians spoken to in Para and Amazonas over the last month
were completely unaware of the event and expressed interest in visiting Rio.
The Earth Summit will be the first big post-cold-war conference, with around
18 new European countries in attendance. Mr Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's chief
negotiator, describes it as 'the most important non-confrontational
conference since San Francisco in 1945'.
Over the weekend the 10m residents of Rio had their first taste of what is
to come with the testing of security operations, which brought traffic to a
complete standstill and caused some panicked residents to think a military
coup had been launched. Some 6,000 army officers patrolled the streets in
tanks with heavy arms, practising for the summit, at which about 125 heads
of state are expected.
One of the leaders of the Brazilian delegation complained after being tailed
by three riflemen: 'The military seem to be taking things to extremes - are
we really going to open tank fire if any problems emerge ?'
For those concerned about pickpockets, Rio's most famous escaped British
train robber, Ronald Biggs, is giving security hints on a daily radio
programme throughout the conference.
