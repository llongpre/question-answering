<HEAD>U.S. Military Authorities Restrict Soviet Eskimo Delegation</HEAD>

   U.S. military authorities restricted
the movements of a Soviet delegation taking part in an Eskimo
conference, participants were told Tuesday.
   The U.S. military told the 18 Soviet delegates to remain in
their hotel during a Sunday night stop at Soendre Stroemfjord, a
U.S. base in Greenland, said the Soviets and the conference
president. Delegates from Alaska and Canada were allowed to move
around the base.
   Canadian Mary Simon, president of the Inuit Circumpolar
Conference, said the incident was unfortunate.
   ``The Soviets are equal participants in our congress and should
have been treated that way. ''
   The Soviets are attending the conference for the first time. The
other delegates are from Canada, Alaska and Greenland. The 500
participants represent the world's more than 100,000 Arctic natives.
   Tuesday was the second day of the weeklong conference, being
held in Sisimiut, a town of 5,000 people on Greenland's east coast.
   Ms. Simon, an Inuit from Quebec, told the conference that
self-government remains a vitally important question for the Inuit
_ or Eskimo _ people.
   Greenland has enjoyed home rule since 1979. But in Canada, the
issue is one of acute concern, and negotiations with the Canadian
government are proceeding slowly, Ms. Simon said.
   In Alaska, the Native Land Claims Settlement of 1971 did nothing
to address the issue of self-government, she said.
