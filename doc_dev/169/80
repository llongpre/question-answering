   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
Alaska natives who want to hunt migratory birds in the spring and
summer.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that treaties
between the United States and other nations generally ban the
hunting between March 10 and Sept. 1.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October ruled in
favor of conservationists who challenged the right of the Alaska
natives to kill migratory waterfowl for food during the offseason.
   The appeals court said the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act of
1918 limits hunting of the birds to those periods approved in
related treaties between the United States and other nations.
   The government has entered treaties with Canada, Mexico, Japan
and the Soviet Union.
   The Canada treaty imposes the strictest limits, essentially
permitting hunting only from Sept. 1 to Dec. 15.
   The Alaska natives, particularly Eskimos living near the
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, say the birds are an important part of their
diet.
   A sharp decline in the population of Cackling Canada Geese,
White Fronted Geese, Pacific Black Brant and Emperor Geese has
caused conservationists to be concerned about their survival.
   The birds nest and raise their young in the delta during the
spring and summer months and then migrate south in early September.
   The Alaska natives said a 1925 federal law authorizes them to
hunt the birds when needed for food, superseding the earlier
Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
   But the 9th Circuit court said the earlier law still governs the
hunting season. Generally, the season may be extended only if
treaties related to the act are amended to relax the restrictions,
the appeals court said.
   However, the appeals court stopped short of banning all
off-season hunting of the waterfowl. Instead, it ordered a federal
judge to conduct further study to determine whether agreements
between the Alaska natives and the U.S. Wildlife Service violate
the treaty act.
   The most recent agreement, called the 1985 Goose Management
Plan, limits hunting of the birds for food but does not prohibit it
entirely.
   The Reagan administration supported the 9th Circuit court ruling.
   The appeal acted on today was filed by lawyers for the Alaska
natives.
   The case is Alaska Federation of Natives vs. Alaska Fish and
Wildlife Federation, 87-1157.
