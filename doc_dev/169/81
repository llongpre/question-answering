Digging for diamonds in the frozen Northwest Territories

Anybody who works outdoors at this time of year in Canada's Northwest
Territories must have a very good reason. Temperatures plummet as low as
 400C, and feel even lower when fierce winds whip across the snow-covered
Arctic tundra. A shovel's metal blade becomes so brittle that it is liable
to snap when weight is put on it. Trucks and machinery must be kept running
around the clock to prevent their engines freezing.
A group of drillers and geologists employed by BHP, the Australian steel and
mining group, are braving these conditions on a frozen lake 310km north-east
of Yellowknife. Shielded from the wind by tarpaulins, they are working
12-hour shifts, day and night, around two 15-metre high drilling rigs. The
men have five days of emergency rations in case blizzards cut them off from
their base camp 4km away.
By the time the ice starts melting in late April, the drills will have
extracted 400 tonnes or more of kimberlite rock from beneath the lake, and
at least one other site nearby. BHP and its partners are confident that the
samples will contain enough high-quality gems to move towards construction
of North America's first diamond mine.
Mr Hugo Dummett, BHP Minerals' exploration manager in North America, says he
will be disappointed if a mine does not materialise. 'We're minimising our
chances of failure,' he says. BHP, which would have a 51 per cent stake in
the project, plans to spend at least CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.68m) on the
drilling programme this year.
Mr John Lydall, mining analyst at First Marathon Securities in Toronto, said
if a mine was built, it could supply about 7 per cent of the world's diamond
market.
The hunt for diamonds in the Northwest Territories has turned into one of
the biggest stampedes in North American mining history. Besides BHP, a
cluster of companies ranging from heavyweights such as De Beers and
Kennecott, to junior exploration outfits such as Kalahari Resources, have
staked claims covering 103,600sq km, an area about the size of Portugal. One
timber supplier in Yellowknife said it has sold 210,000 wooden stakes in the
past 12 months to mining companies, compared with 25,000 in a normal year.
The staking frenzy is reflected in the share prices of some of the players:
Dia Met Minerals, BHP's Canadian partner, now has a market value of almost
CDollars 450m, with its share price zooming up from less than a dollar in
late 1991 to CDollars 43 now. Two French banks, Societe Generale and Credit
Lyonnais, are in the process of buying CDollars 13m worth of Dia Met stock.
The story of diamond fever in the frozen north goes back to the early 1980s
when Mr Dummett, who then worked for Superior Oil, was tipped off by a bush
pilot that De Beers was prospecting along the Mackenzie River. Under cover
of darkness, Mr Dummett and Mr Charles Fipke, a Canadian geologist and Dia
Met's founder, landed a helicopter close to the De Beers camp and picked up
some samples.
Over the next few years, the search moved eastward towards the source of the
vast ice sheet which millions of years ago scraped up - and then deposited -
metal-bearing rocks across northern Canada.
The BHP-Dia Met joint venture, which was formed in 1990, made a breakthrough
in late 1991 in the Lac de Gras area, 350km east of the Mackenzie River.
Samples from a kimberlite pipe beneath Point Lake yielded 101 carats of
diamonds, equal to about 70 carats per 100 tonnes, which is well above the
grade normally required to justify a mine.
The purpose of this winter's drilling programme is to extract bigger samples
from other kimberlite pipes on BHP's 875,000 acre claim. The frozen samples
are transported by truck to a Dia Met processing laboratory in Colorado. The
results will be made known later this year.
BHP wants to have a sample of at least 2,000 carats before it decides
whether to press ahead with construction of a mine.
The partners are already confident that the quantity of diamonds in the Lac
de Gras kimberlite pipes is sufficient to support a mine milling around
10,000 tonnes of ore a day. Their optimism is based largely on the results
of research by Professor John Gurney, a geo-chemist at the University of
Cape Town.
Prof Gurney's theory, which appears to be supported by almost every diamond
discovery around the world, is that a kimberlite pipe is virtually certain
to contain diamonds if the purple-grey garnets in the pipe combine a high
chrome content with less than 4 per cent calcium. According to the BHP team,
the calcium content of the garnets found around Lac de Gras is 0.7 per cent
or lower.
What still remains to be established however, is the quality of the Lac de
Gras diamonds. According to Mr Fipke, 'we can predict diamond grades. But no
one can predict the per cent of gem quality.' Roughly one out of 200
kimberlite pipes contain diamonds, but only one in 20 of those has a high
enough proportion of gemstones to justify a mine.
The Northwest Territories diamond rush may yet come to naught. In spite of
the excitement, mining analysts caution that the shares of the companies
involved are for speculators only.
But if all goes well at Lac de Gras, BHP and its partners could have a mine
in operation by 1997 or 1998. They are unconcerned by the recent glut in the
world diamond market.
With many of the alluvial mines on the west coast of southern Africa as well
as the big Argyle property in Australia likely to run out of stones within
the next decade or so, the hope is that any new mines in the Northwest
Territories will come on stream at just the right time.
