<HEAD>Soviet Eskimo Dancers Arrive in Nome under Visa-Free Agreement</HEAD>

   Two Soviet Eskimo dancers are visiting
northwest Alaska in the first instance such travel has been
permitted without visas since 1948, authorities said Sunday.
   Misha Ankarin and Yakov Tagiok arrived in Nome Saturday on a
special waiver granted by the U.S. State Department. The men were
invited by the Nana Native Corp. in Kotzebue to spend the summer
performing with that city's Northern Lights dancers.
   Tagiok, told reporters he hoped the first visa-free connection
between U.S. and Soviet Eskimos would make future visits easier.
   The agreement for visa-free travel among Eskimos from the two
nations was signed last year by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister. The
accord is still being finalized, and the visit by the Eskimo
dancers was made as a goodwill gesture.
   Alaskan Eskimos have yet to be allowed to visit the Soviet Far
East without visas.
   The agreement affects natives of the Bering Strait area of the
Soviet Far East coast and from the Kobuk and Nome areas in Alaska.
   Ankarin and Tagiok are visiting friends and relatives in Nome
and plan to stay in Alaska two to three months. They said they also
may take trips to Anchorage and Fairbanks.
