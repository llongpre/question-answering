   Despite official predictions that oil from the
largest U.S. spill ever will not reach Canadian waters, the
spreading Alaskan slick is causing growing concern about Arctic
development and tanker shipping.
   ``I think it's so massive that we just don't know what we're
going to do with it at this time,'' Arne Hansen of the Western
Canada Wilderness Committee said Wednesday by telephone from
Vancouver, British Columbia.
   He said the the environmental group long has been worried about
supertankers in the Pacific lanes off of Canada.
   ``We had been expecting a spill like this for years,'' Hansen
said. ``It's like a meltdown of a nuclear reactor.''
   The spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound has been a leading
news story in Canada since the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on
Friday.
   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard told reporters Tuesday at a
meeting in Meech Lake, Quebec, that it might be a good idea to
review the Canada-U.S. agreement on West Coast oil shipping.
   ``We are concerned about what happened because we know that
these kind of disasters can happen everywhere,'' he said. ``So we
will see what we can do for the future.''
   Bouchard and his aides have said repeatedly that it is unlikely
the oil spill off Valdez, Alaska, will directly affect Canadian
waters or shores.
   When asked about the U.S. plan to allow some oil and gas
drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge bordering Canada, Bouchard
said the Arctic ``is an extremely fragile area.''
   ``We are extremely worried, we are opposed to this,'' he said.
   The Canadian government has said it opposes the plan for the
Alaskan development next to its Yukon territory because it could
disrupt the migratory patterns of the porcupine caribou herd.
   James Fulton, environment critic for the socialist New
Democratic Party, predicted in a telephone interview from Ottawa
that some oil from the Valdez spill eventually will affect Canadian
territory even if the prevailing currents move the bulk of it north.
   ``I've looked at all of the most recent tidal and current
charts,'' he said. ``I don't think there's much doubt that some of
the spill is likely to reach Canadian territory.''
   Fulton represents in Parliament British Columbia's Skeena
district, which includes the province's northwestern Pacific coast.
   He said the difficulties in the cleanup show that the oil
industry's ``state of prepardeness is very close to zero.''
   Calls to his office have been running 9-to-1 in favor of action
such as a halt to tanker traffic, Fulton said.
   ``People are mad,'' he said. ``People are getting really sick
and tired of being kicked around by large corporations.''
