   A Soviet-American dog sledding team plans to make
a 1,200-mile goodwill trek across the Bering Strait, the first
officially sanctioned crossing since 1948.
   Ten men and two women _ six Soviets and six Americans _ will
depart March 1 from Anadyr, Siberia, on the two-month journey,
visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route.
   ``Some of the team members have relatives on the other side,'' so
the visits could get emotional, said expedition co-leader Paul
Schurke, 33, of Minneapolis.
   The expedition is an effort to call attention to the common
cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the Bering region,
Schurke said at a news conference Tuesday at the swanky Russian Tea
Room restaurant.
   And since villagers in the remote region rarely get out-of-town
visitors, he said, they are expecting big welcomes, especially from
children who will probably get the day off from school to ski along
with the team.
   The Soviet co-leader is Dmitry Shparo, 47, of Moscow, who in 1979
won his country's highest honor, the Order of Lenin, for
successfully leading a ski expedition to the North Pole. Last year,
he was a member of a Soviet-Canadian trek across the polar ice cap
from the USSR to Canada.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, called the Bering Bridge
Expedition ``another step toward melting the ice curtain.''
   Murkowski, who attended Tuesday's news conference, noted that the
U.S. government is working on a treaty with the Soviets to permit
American Eskimos to visit and trade with their counterparts in
Siberia without visas.
   In 1938, the two countries signed an agreement that enabled
travel in the Bering region, but it was abrogated in 1948 during the
iciest days of the Cold War.
   In the spirit of adventure diplomacy, the team hopes a new
agreement can be signed at a ceremony at the U.S.-Soviet border
around April 1.
   ``When you're only 2{ miles from your neighbor, it shouldn't take
40 years to renew your relationship,'' said Murkowski, referring to
the narrow strait between the islands of Big Diomede and Little
Diomede, the narrowest distance between the superpowers.
   ``The Bering Strait is the shortest distance between the two
greatest powers in the world,'' said Schurke, who made an unassisted
trek to the North Pole in 1986.
   ``Yet it remains a cold reminder of untapped potential for
exchange. We are looking forward to setting an example for the world
and uniting a people too long divided.''
