AUSTRALIA'S BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner, Dia-Met Minerals, have
moved one step closer to building North America's first diamond mine in the
Lac de Gras area of the Northwest Territories.
The two companies said that they planned to erect a pilot recovery plant in
the area early next year to analyse a bulk sample of between 5,000 and
10,000 tonnes of ore. Depending on the results, these tests would be
followed by a full feasibility study for a mine. Lac de Gras is just below
the Arctic Circle, about 320 km (200 miles) north-east of Yellowknife, the
territories' capital.
The decision to go ahead with such a large sampling programme is based on
the results of drilling last winter which appear to confirm a sizeable
diamond deposit. Analysts at Pacific International Securities in Vancouver
said yesterday that the grade of ore recovered from one of four kimberlite
pipes at Lac de Gras 'puts it into the league of world-class diamond pipes'.
Despite such enthusiasm, Dia-Met's shares tumbled by CDollars 9 to CDollars
57 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. The share price
had tripled in the past year in anticipation of positive results from Lac de
Gras.
According to BHP and Dia-Met, a total of 206 carats were recovered from just
over 400 tonnes of ore extracted from the four pipes. The results include
only stones with a diameter of more than half a millimetre.
The companies said that they had found several gem diamonds in the one to
three carat range.
The proportion of gem diamonds ranged from a low of 6 per cent in pipe
number two to 31 per cent in pipe four and 33 per cent in pipe three.
Pipe four contains a grade of 17.5 gem carats per 100 tonnes. Pacific
International estimates that this is nearly double the grade indicated by a
sample recovered from the nearby Point Lake property in late 1991 which set
off the diamond stampede in the Northwest Territories.
Meanwhile, the Canadian government has announced changes in income tax rules
to encourage diamond exploration. Developers of diamond mines will in future
be entitled to accelerated depreciation of capital costs, while exploration
companies will be able to finance their work by means of 'flow-through'
shares which offer substantial tax benefits to investors.
