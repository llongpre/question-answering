Trio Holdings, David Hagan's money-broking outfit, is hardly a household
name so only an alert merchant banker would have spotted the new competition
on the block. A bunch of Canadian Inuits is helping underwrite Trio's Pounds
6.5m rights issue.
Don't laugh - Hagan could be on to something. Inuvialuit Investments (II),
which is co-underwriting the issue, helps invest the loot of Canada's Inuit
people. The Inuit have come into tons of money in recent years thanks to
payments from the federal government to settle long-standing land claims.
The Inuit in the eastern half of the Northwest Territories, for example, won
a land-claims settlement last year that will net them almost CDollars 1.2bn
over 14 years. Royalties from mines and oil and gas wells in the Northwest
Territories are likely to swell their coffers still further.
Trio's newfound underwriter is based high above the Arctic Circle and is the
international investment arm of Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC). II
almost doubled its money earlier this year when it sold a 10 per cent stake
in Hong Kong's Regent Pacific Group, which just happens to be Trio's biggest
investor and is the main underwriter of the Trio issue. Don't fancy Hagan's
chances if he lets those eskimos down.
