   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government is opening up a record
amount of far northern acreage for oil exploration, but
industry analysts say they doubt the offering will generate
much interest.
   The area covers more than 18.8 million acres in the
northwest corner of Canada near the Alaskan border. The
tract, which is almost as big as South Carolina, includes
portions of the Mackenzie River delta and the Beaufort Sea,
which flows into the Arctic Ocean. Substantial amounts of oil
and gas have been found in the area, but there has been no
production because it is too costly.

   The government currently is asking oil companies to
nominate specific areas of interest within the vast tract. It
is the first call for nominations in 25 years that includes
parcels in the Mackenzie River delta. An offering of drilling
rights on portions of nominated land usually follows a call
for nominations. Bids for the exploration rights are made in
the form of work commitments.
   The call kicks off what is expected to be a succession of
annual rights offerings for broader tracts of land in
Canada's northern frontier.
   "It hopefully will get the ball rolling again," said Lucie
Napert, a Canadian government official who oversees rights
offerings in Canada's Arctic region. The area "has been
dormant for quite some time."
   Some companies have surrendered northern acreage to the
government rather than fulfilling work commitments because of
doubts that oil prices will rise high enough in the near
future to warrant the heavy exploration costs. Numerous oil
and gas wells in the Mackenzie River delta and Beaufort Sea
have been capped.
   "You're not going to see much activity up there" over the
next few years, predicted a spokesman for Esso Resources
Canada Ltd., the exploration division of Imperial Oil Ltd.
   Canada's oil industry currently doesn't have the financial
strength to meet the high costs of northern exploration, said
Ian Doig, editor of Doig's Digest, an industry newsletter.
Plans by two of Canada's major oil companies to reduce their
northern acreage later this year don't "augur well" for the
revival of activity, he said.
   Amoco Corp.'s Canadian division will relinquish later this
year its rights to more than one million acres of concessions
in the Beaufort Sea, reducing its northern acreage by about
50%. Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., which is controlled by
Toronto's Reichmann family, will give up its rights to
600,000 acres.
   In order to retain their exploration rights, Gulf and
Amoco would have had to drill at least one well each this
year, but neither company could find partners to share in the
exploration cost.
   A typical offshore oil well in Canada's Beaufort Sea costs
about 60 million Canadian dollars (US$52.3 million) compared
with about C$500,000 for the average onshore well.
   This is the second consecutive year that drilling in the
Beaufort will be at a standstill. The area at one time was
thought to be one of Canada's most promising oil basins. But
after 20 years of exploration, no oil has ever been brought
to market and there is still no pipeline in the region.
   Imperial Oil, which is about 70%-owned by Exxon Corp.,
took a C$141 million writeoff of its assets in the Beaufort
Sea last year because of what it called "increased
uncertainty about the timing and feasibility of oil
production" in the region.
   Prospects for developing the gas pools in the Mackenzie
Delta also dimmed earlier this year after Esso Resources
Canada struck a dry well.
   The Geological Survey of Canada estimated that the
Mackenzie Delta and Beaufort Sea contain about 53.3 trillion
cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas, but it said only
about 15% would be economic with gas prices at about C$3
(US$2.62) per thousand cubic feet. Natural gas is currently
quoted at US$1.33 per thousand cubic feet.
   Development of Canada's northern gas pools "is a long way
off," said Roland Priddle, chairman of Canada's National
Energy Board. He said an oil or gas pipeline connecting
northern reserves to southern markets would cost about C$2.4
billion. Such a pipeline isn't likely to be built in this
decade, Mr. Priddle said.
   The call for nominations closes July 15 and a rights
offering probably will be held in August. Companies can
designate and bid for acreage in a disputed portion of the
Beaufort Sea that both Canada and the U.S. claim as their
own. Exploration is prohibited in the area, but companies bid
for the disputed land in the hope of eventually being able to
drill there.
   In addition, the government announced plans to offer
exploration rights to 118,962 acres on Cameron Island in
Canada's high Arctic. Bidding closes Aug. 15. Panarctic Oils
Ltd., owned by a group of companies, is the only oil concern
currently active in the region. It operates the Bent Horn oil
field on Cameron Island. No well has been drilled in the
Arctic Islands since 1987.
