   A congressional study says the Reagan
administration's proposal to trade away potentially valuable oil
rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not in the public
interest and should be abandoned.
   The assessment from the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, is being disputed by an Interior
Department official, who says the proposed land exchange offers the
nation a unique chance to acquire valuable fish and wildlife
habitat.
   The GAO study focused on Interior's proposal to trade the
mineral rights to 166,000 acres in the refuge for surface rights to
896,000 acres owned by six Alaska native corporations in seven
other wildlife refuges in the state.
   Last month, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel ordered the trade
put on hold until after Congress confronts the larger question of
whether to allow development of the possibly large oil reserves in
Arctic refuge's 1.5 million acre coastal plain.
   GAO said Interior has valued the 896,000 acres at six times
their appraised market value and that three-fourths of the land has
``only limited wildlife and habitat protection benefits.''
   And while Interior is rating the deal as an even-up trade worth
$539 million to both sides, it is impossible to calculate the value
of the oil rights in the refuge until more exploration is done,
according to GAO.
   ``Interior told GAO that the actual values for the best (Arctic
refuge) tracts could be between zero and 6.5 times the estimated
value,'' GAO said in the study released by Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif.
   ``Under the proposed land exchanges, however, Interior neither
required the native corporations to bid against one another
competitively for the tracts nor retained a continuing monetary
interest in any future oil production,'' GAO said.
   ``GAO believes that the proposed exhanges are not in the best
interests of the government,'' said the study, urging Congress to
reject the plan if Interior refuses to abandon it.
   GAO noted that the $539 million value assigned by Interior to
the 896,000 acres in other reserves is far beyond their appraised
value of $90 million.
   About 279,000 acres were given low acquisition priority or rated
unsuitable for acquisition by Interior, while another 349,000 acres
are already protected from uses inconsistent with refuge programs,
according to GAO.
   ``Finally, about 53,000 acres are most threatened by subsurface
mineral development, but Interior would not acquire the the
subsurface rights under the terms of the exchanges,'' the study
said.
   Susan Recce, deputy assistant Interior secretary for fish and
wildlife and parks, defended the proposed trade as a ``unique,
perhaps one-time opportunity'' to acquire pockets of land owned by
natives in federal refuges.
   Aleuts, Eskimos and Tlingits are among the major groups native
to Alaska.
   In a letter to GAO, Recce pointed out that Interior is forbidden
by law from using condemnation to acquire such inholdings in
Alaska, leaving the ``negotiating climate ... radically altered in
favor'' of the natives.
   She said that although not all the land that would acquired by
the government is high on Interior's acquisition list, the agency
presumes that all privately owned lands within a refuge ``are
suitable for acquisition.''
   Recce said there is legal uncertainty whether the 349,000 acres
are protected from private development. She said that while the
53,000 acres would be open to mineral development, a recent study
suggests this land has a low potential for it.
   Although the Alaska public lands act generally requires land
exchanges in Alaska to be on the basis of equal value, the Interior
secretary can make one of unequal value if ``it is in the public
interest,'' Recce noted.
