   The year's longest day for many
residents of northern latitudes consists of midnight barbecues and
3 a.m. softball games. But for some, the total lack of darkness is
no fun at all.
   In much of Alaska and other parts of the north, summer solstice
_ June 21 _ brings 24 hours of daylight and one of the year's most
celebrated times. The clanging of ice-cream trucks can be heard
late into the evening. To the delight of children, bedtime never
seems to come.
   But while most northerners blossom, some just cannot adapt.
   ``It was really bizarre,'' said Paul Korchin, who spent three
years in Nome on the Bering Sea and recently returned to Virginia.
``I found it extremely difficult to get a good night's sleep. Even
the littlest crack of light would bug me.''
   The sun, shining brightly past midnight, ``freaked me out,'' he
said. ``All that light would get on my nerves.''
   Korchin, whose jobs included a stint as a police dispatcher,
said all summer long he felt bedraggled: ``It got so bad I went to
the clinic to get checked out.''
   Eventually, he taped cardboard over his windows so he could
sleep.
   Along the Arctic coast, the sun has been up since May 11, arcing
through the sky. It will set again Aug. 2. Even as far south as
Anchorage, twilight lasts all night, though the sun does set for
about 3{ hours.
   North of the Arctic Circle, in communities along the Arctic
Ocean such as Barrow and Wainwright, residents in summer hunt and
fish, work and play all day.
   ``We just don't sleep. Your body feels like it doesn't need
sleep,'' said Eric Loring, an anthropologist in Anchorage.
   For two years, Loring has studied Native life at Wainwright, a
village more than 700 miles northwest of Anchorage. When he first
arrived there, he went to a whaling camp. Because it never got
dark, he said, he lost all track of time.
   ``When I got back home, I thought it had been just a day or
two,'' he said.
   Five days had passed.
   ``I just could not believe it,'' he said.
   Although Loring has studied northern populations for 13 years,
mostly in Canada, he still expresses amazement at differences in
daily life.
   ``It's flat out. You're up, you're about, hunting caribou,
whatever time it happens to be. There's no clock.''
   He adds: ``Some people do go nuts. ... To me now it's just
normal. And it's kind of weird to sleep in the dark now.''
   Recreation begins after dinner, often as late as 1 a.m. or 2
a.m. Softball and volleyball games are continuous, and children
talk to each other through the night on citizens band radios _ the
primary form of communication in the village.
   But then there's the dark side: In winter, there's no light,
especially above the Arctic Circle.
   And it results in what some call cabin fever, that depression
and frustration that creeps up during long spells of darkness and
bad weather.
   Scientists call it seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, and its
effects can be mild or devastating depending on the sufferer.
   Depression increases significantly among northern populations
during the winter, said Dr. Carla Hellekson, a psychiatrist and
sleep-disorder specialist at the Providence Sleep Disorders Center
of Seattle.
   SAD causes some people to sleep 14 to 16 hours a day, overeat,
become agitated and generally complain of the ``winter blahs,''
Hellekson said.
   That contrasts with what Hellekson calls ``summer energy
syndrome.''
   ``People are on a roll, talking more, shedding weight. ... It's
not a disorder. Don't call it hypermania,'' she says.
   Dr. Ted Mala, who heads the Institute for Circumpolar Health
Studies in Anchorage, says the explanation is partly chemical. The
pineal gland in the brain secretes more endorphins under
full-spectrum light. The result: People feel better in summer.
