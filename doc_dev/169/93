   The Canadian government has blocked efforts by
Chicago's Shedd Aquarium to buy three beluga whales from Eskimos
near Hudson Bay, officials say.
   The aquarium had planned to buy the whales this summer for its
$43 million ``Oceanarium,'' a marine mammal pavilion due to be
opened next year.
   But under pressure from environmentalists, the Ottawa government
blocked the deal. Canadian officials gave no reason, but promised to
explain their denial by next week, said aquarium spokeswoman Betsy
Raymond.
   However, an unidentified official of the Canadian Ministry of
Fisheries and Oceans told the Chicago Tribune that his agency
doesn't think the Chicago aquarium has experts on its staff who know
how to care for belugas.
   He also expressed concern that the aquarium's new addition
wouldn't be ready by the time the belugas were to be captured.
   But Shedd's assistant director, David Lonsdale, said the aquarium
does have qualified staff members to care for the whales, who would
have been housed outside Chicago until the Oceanarium is finished.
   Barry Kent MacKay, wildlife coordinator for the Toronto Humane
Society, hailed the ministry's decision.
   ``It's a tradition for the (Eskimos) to kill belugas and eat
them, but it's not a tradition for them to sell them to the Shedd
Aquarium,'' he said.
   But Shedd officials contend the best way to educate the public
about the need to protect whales is to display them in aquariums.
   Beluga whales are not considered an endangered species, and under
Canadian law, MacKay said, Eskimos near Hudson Bay are allowed to
exercise their native hunting rights to capture a half dozen or so
whales each summer.
   Beluga whales are 10 to 15 feet long and resemble dolphins.
   Ms. Raymond said the aquarium will acquire three much larger and
more plentiful Pacific black whales for the new pavilion.
