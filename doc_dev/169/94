   For perhaps the first time in a century,
North American Indians have taken up arms against the white man and
won an important battle.
   The war is far from over, but the lesson from the six-week
confrontation between Mohawks and the forces of law and order seems
to be that violence and militancy get public attention _ and public
attention leads to action.
   The situation has evolved considerably since July 11, when the
provincial police launched an ill-advised attack on a small group
of Mohawk militants blocking a road through Kanesatake reserve at
Oka, just west of Montreal on the St. Lawrence River.
   The police were repulsed and an officer was killed, though it is
still unclear by whom.
   To the south of Montreal, in the bedroom community of
Chateauguay, Mohawks from the Kahnawake reserve set up a sympathy
blockade, shutting down the Mercier bridge vital to commuters who
work in the city.
   Since then there has been a steady war of nerves, growing anger
on the part of frustrated south shore residents, three nights of
rioting last week and on-again, off-again talks.
   On Thursday, serious negotiations finally got under way and the
army began preparations over the weekend to replace the weary
police on the barricades.
   Ostensibly, the fuss was over the village of Oka's plan to
expand its nine-hole golf course on land the Indians claim is
theirs, including a sacred burial ground. The golf course question
was resolved when the federal government agreed to purchase the
land and turn it over to the Mohawks.
   But the land claim issue is much wider and much more complicated
here, and it goes far beyond the Mohawks at Kanesatake and
Kahnawake.
   ``Any outcome at Oka short of a bloodbath will send a powerful
message to native people across Canada whose grievances far
outweigh those of Kanesatake,'' wrote University of Toronto
historian Desmond Morton.
   ``Even the massive land claims settlement in the western Arctic,
proudly announced last spring, is now in a state of collapse while
native leaders wait to see whether Oka tactics produce better
terms.''
   Ojibwa Indians in Ontario jumped on the bandwagon and cut all
east-west rail traffic to support their land claims. One band set
up a blockade at Longlac and another group cut rail traffic east of
White River, north of Lake Superior. However, authorities said
Sunday that the Longlac group had agreed to end their blockade.
   There are thousands of Indian land claims pending before the
federal government, covering about two-thirds of Canada's
territory. The government actively processes only six at a time and
typically settlements take 20 years or more.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, who called on the army for help,
seems to have only two options, neither of them good.
   He can again try to dislodge the Indians by force, in front of a
worldwide television audience and international observers. Or he
can surrender to the pressure and negotiate with gun-toting
militants who clearly have broken the law. He has opted for the
second.
   The situation on the ground now is being watched by 24 observers
from the Paris-based International Federation of Human rights. The
negotiation process has been sealed off.
   The Quebec public was horrified last week when it saw a federal
minister, a provincial minister and a judge sit down with armed,
masked Indians to sign a document on a format for talks.
   The image remains indelible.
   ``Did you see that scene here with the ministers?'' lamented
Yvan Patry, mayor of Oka Parish, which surrounds both the village
of Oka and the Kanesatake reserve.
   Both sides in the conflict have clammed up since the beginning
of talks. They say they have agreed not to speak about the
negotiations, not even what is on the agenda.
   Tom Siddon, the federal minister of Indian affairs, claims that
promises to reopen land claim talks with the Mohawks have nothing
to do with the blockades in Oka and Chateauguay.
   ``I don't in any way agree with any suggestion that we have
agreed to negotiate in the face of guns,'' said Siddon. ``We will
not.''
   Appearances, however, are to the contrary.
   The Kanesatake reserve is a patchwork of Indian territory with
pieces separated by privately owned land. There had been earlier
talks about finding a way to join up the various patches of Mohawk
land.
   What the federal and provincial governments clearly fear is
setting a dangerous precedent.
   ``Blockades will not result in any band being allowed to jump
the queue in the claims process,'' the minister vowed.
   One thing is certain. The barricades will come down one day
soon, and it appears likely that the band of Mohawk warriors who
held off the forces of the white man will walk away with their
heads held high and an inspiration for their brothers elsewhere.
   And that is, perhaps, the biggest concern of the Canadian
authorities.
