   Alaskan and Soviet Eskimos holding
their first major reunion since the Cold War imposed a forced
separation 40 years ago sang and talked animatedly today about
current events _ like walrus hunting.
   The meeting at the Palace of Culture in this remote Siberian
port was one of the highlights of the 225-mile ``friendship
flight'' from the western Alaska town of Nome by an 82-member U.S.
delegation.
   Timothy Gologergen, 68, of Nome shared a traditional song with a
Siberian Eskimo who identified himself as Kaygigun, 41, from the
nearby village of New Chaplino.
   ``They got three walruses last night,'' Gologergen said later.
``They were hauling them back and forth by dog team, and he heard
that we were coming. He dropped everything and came over.
   ``He said this way is really good _ just to speak our own
(Yupik) dialect and not listen to the war stories or think about
war, or plan about war _ just be doing our thing, speaking our
Yupik language and hunting and being relaxed,'' Gologergen said.
   The Soviets earlier this month approved the charter flight by
Eskimos, Alaskan business leaders, peace activists and politicians,
the product of two years' work by Alaskans.
   Eskimos once freely crossed the icy Bering Strait in motorboats
and walrus-skin umiaks to trade and visit with relatives. The Cold
War ended all that in 1948, when the border was closed.
   Summit meetings between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev helped make the ``friendship flight'' possible,
said Bob Clarke, a State Department official on the flight.
   The summits were ``strong on people-to-people exchanges,''
Clarke said. ``This is a real grass-roots effort.''
   The leader of the effort was James Stimpfle, a 40-year-old Nome
real estate agent who dreamed up the flight two years ago to help
thaw relations between Alaska and Siberia.
   Stimpfle said he wrote hundreds of letters to U.S. and Soviet
officials, trying to win acceptance for his idea of breaking down
political barriers with good will.
   ``There's security in friendship,'' he said.
   While eastern Siberia is eight time zones away from Moscow, it's
only 3 miles from Alaska at the closest point.
   Provideniya, with about 5,000 residents, is a gray city of
concrete-block apartments surrounded by mountains. Remnants of the
winter's packed ice still clog the fringes of the harbor. Like
Nome, an old gold-rush town of 3,700, Provideniya has no roads
leading inland.
   As the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 came to a halt on the gravel
Siberian runway, schoolchildren waved Soviet and U.S. flags. Local
officials and visitors shouted greetings in Russian, English and
Yupik over the roar of jets.
   Leaders of the Alaskan delegation were handed carnations beneath
a sign proclaiming ``Peace and Friendship Between Alaska and
Chukotka!'' Provideniya is in the district of Chokotka.
   Formality soon gave way to a frenzy of hugs, handshakes and
trading of pins, flags, chewing gum and postcards.
   The reunion came too late for John Waghiyi, 64, an Eskimo born
on St. Lawrence Island, 40 miles from the Siberian coast, who came
looking for a distant relative on his father's side, but learned
the man had died years ago.
   Waghiyi remembered visiting the relative as a young man.
   ``The next year, I was going to see him at Gambell (on St.
Lawrence Island). He was going to give me a Russian coat, but they
closed the Russian border.''
   Other potential reunions were aborted when a planned trip to a
nearby native village was canceled by poor weather.
   Still, Waghiyi and others hoped the visit would clear the way
for more interchanges between Alaska and Siberia. Gologergen said
that, governments willing, the Siberian Eskimos would visit Alaska.
   ``We were like East and Western Germany before,'' said Waghiyi.
``We were like behind the Iron Curtain. Now we're going to be in
their front yard.''
