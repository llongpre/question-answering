   The Canadian government received an "encouraging but not exceptional" response to a call for nominations for a planned offering of petroleum-exploration permits in the Beaufort Sea, said a senior government energy official. 

   Nominations are indications of interest in specific areas that would be attractive for exploration. 
The offering will be the first held in the Canadian Arctic in 20 years. 
The Canadian Oil and Gas Lands Administration will auction as many as four parcels totaling about 500,000 acres in the central Beaufort Sea which runs into the Arctic Ocean. 

   Maurice Taschereau, the government agency's administrator, said more than 50% of the area outlined by the government was nominated by the industry. 
He wouldn't disclose the number of nominations received or the areas that generated the most interest. 
The auction is expected to take place in a month. 

   One well is being drilled in the area. 
A well scheduled to begin this winter has been delayed by environmental concerns. 
Most of the current rights were issued in the 1960s and will expire within the next few years. 
There hasn't been any rights offered since then because of native land claims that are nearing settlement. 

   Interest in the area is expected to be renewed by a project of Esso Resources Canada Ltd., Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. to export more than nine trillion cubic feet of natural gas from the Mackenzie River Delta to the U.S. starting in 1996. 
The National Energy Board, a Canadian regulatory agency, is to rule on the gas exports next month. 

   Esso is a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd., which is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., Shell is about 71%-owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Gulf Canada is a unit of Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.
