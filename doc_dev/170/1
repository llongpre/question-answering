   The 87 people who died in a social club fire
were martyrs to the quest for a better life, just like 146 people
killed exactly 79 years earlier in a fire in a city garment
factory, Mayor David Dinkins said Monday.
   Dinkins told about 700 people at a memorial service for victims
of the 1911 fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. that both tragedies
killed immigrants looking for improved living conditions in America.
   ``With vicious irony yesterday, on the 79th anniversary of the
Triangle Shirtwaist fire, history repeated itself,'' the mayor said
at the site of the earlier blaze.
   On Sunday, the bodies of trapped revelers were found packed into
the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx. A Cuban immigrant was
charged with setting fire to the club's only exit after he was
thrown out.
   Authorities said the club's patrons never had a chance to escape
the blaze because the building did not follow fire codes. It was
the same lack of concern for people that caused such devastation at
the Triangle factory in Greenwich Village, Dinkins said.
   ``So the lessons of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire are not
something we commemorate today, they are lessons that have been
driven home for us all to learn, once again,'' Dinkins said.
   ``Now, the martyrs of March 25, 1911, and the martyrs of March
25, 1990, are joined forever,'' he said. ``Like the victims at the
Happy Land Social Club, most of those who died on this killing
ground were immigrants to our shores.''
   ``They, too, came to America to find a dream. Instead, they
found misery, exploitation and an agonizing death,'' he said.
``These 146 workers didn't have to die. Neither did the 87 people
in the Bronx.''
   Later, a fire truck ladder was raised up to the 10-story
building's sixth floor, the highest a fire ladder would go in those
days, as a fire bell was rung to mark the deaths. A wreath of white
roses was placed above pictures of the fire.
   ``They died at this building because they were seen as surplus
labor. They died because they didn't speak English very well,
because they weren't organized, because no one spoke up for them or
represented their interests and because their employer didn't care
about them,'' Dinkins said.
   ``In fact, that very day in 1911, their boss went out late in
the afternoon and locked all the workers of the Triangle Shirtwaist
Co. inside, just to make sure none of them tried to leave early
while he did some shopping,'' he said.
   ``All 146 of them died painfully, horribly, just like the 87 who
died yesterday,'' the mayor added. ``And all of them died
unnecessarily, just like the 87 who died yesterday.''
   He recalled, though, that the workers' deaths inspired the labor
movement and brought about lasting changes in laws to protect
workers. Sweatshops have re-emerged in recent years and it is
necessary again to battle exploitation, Dinkins said.
   ``And again, there are those operating in the shadows, running
sweatshops and illegal social clubs and pursuing other schemes,
turning the lure and promise of America into a nightmare for those
who seek to redeem the promise,'' he said.
