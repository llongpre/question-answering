   Fire raced through a Bronx social club, snuffing
out lives in a rush of flame and toxic smoke. The mayor, horrified
at the carnage, formed a task force to close down the city's
illegal nightspots.
   That was a year and a half ago.
   Sunday, the nightmare returned in an even crueler incarnation.
Instead of six people, 87 were now dead in a crowded club. The
city's crackdown had failed. And given continued failure, experts
said Monday, many more may die.
   ``These places are fire traps. They're supermarkets of crime.
They're in violation of every code imaginable,'' said state Sen.
Jeremy Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat who led an investigation of
illegal social clubs in 1981.
   ``It's not just the city of New York, it's true for every city
in the country,'' he said in an interview. ``It's something every
urban area has had to deal with in the last decade. And none has
been dealing with it.''
   Indeed, despite a renewed crackdown announced Monday. ``It
wouldn't shock me if this happened again,'' said Charles Ryan, an
ex-fire captain and now fire science department chairman at John
Jay College of Criminal Justice. ``These places reopen as fast as
they shut 'em down.''
   The problem is not a new one. In 1942, 491 people lost their
lives at Boston's Cocoanut Grove club in the nation's worst fire
ever. Like the Happy Land Social Club, site of Sunday's fire, the
Cocoanut Grove was overcrowded at the time of the blaze and lacked
adequate exits for patrons.
   That fire led to new national fire codes for emergency exits,
lighting and other factors that could contribute to a blaze.
   Ryan and others said the simple problem is in enforcing such
laws. But it also is more complex than that, they said _ a
combination of the city's enormous problems, shrinking budget and
paralyzing bureaucracy.
   And there is another, equally daunting factor: Tremendous demand
for the illegal but inexpensive clubs, particularly in poor
immigrant communities where life is difficult, diversions are
scarce and danger is a commonplace.
   ``People who are living in tough conditions of life are going to
look for opportunities to blow off some steam,'' said Prof. William
Kornblum, director of the Social Research Center at the City
University of New York's graduate school. ``They're going to pay
less attention to the dangers around them.''
   The hazards can be legion. At the Happy Land club, authorities
say there was no open fire exit, no first-floor sprinkler system,
no proper emergency lights, and bars on the sole window.
   The only way out was through the front door. It was blocked by
flames, allegedly ignited by an arsonist. Sixty-one men and 26
women died.
   The deaths are all the more tragic for the city's failed effort
to shut down the Happy Land. The task force formed by Mayor Edward
I. Koch in 1988 won an order that year that it be closed.
Apparently it was, for a time. And at some point, unknown to the
authorities, it reopened.
   ``Most horrifying is that this should never have happened,''
said Mayor David Dinkins. ``That club had been inspected. It had
been cited. And it had been ordered closed.'' He immediately
launched another crackdown, with police posting vacate orders on
187 social clubs Sunday night.
   But those orders don't solve the problem. Said Ryan: ``Issuing a
piece of paper and saying, `You're closed' doesn't mean anything
unless you come around and whack the guy on the head.''
   With 2,031 inspections by the task force last year,
identification of illegal clubs has been adequate, Ryan said.
``It's the follow-up that's weak,'' he said. ``That's the nut of
the problem: inadequate enforcement.''
   Fuller enforcement would require substantial manpower. The
police estimate there are 1,220 social clubs in the city, with
about 1,000 listed as inactive. But Happy Land was one of those
``inactive'' clubs.
   Kornblum guessed the city in fact has 500 to 600 operating
social clubs _ some legal, many not _ with more in nearby suburbs.
   ``It is true that complete enforcement is futile. The clubs are
always moving to new locations, always trying to stay a step or two
ahead of the authorities,'' Kornblum said. But he said aggressive
followup could save lives, if the city provided the resources.
   There are other approaches as well. With a view of social clubs
as cultural centers, Kornblum suggested low-interest city loans for
legally operated clubs that could take the place of illegal dives.
   Ryan, for his part, suggested cracking down on the liquor
merchants who keep the clubs supplied, and possibly placing a legal
limit on retail liquor sales. Weinstein said he would investigate
the idea.
   Yet Weinstein noted that little of this is new. In 1981, his
panel's report on illegal social clubs included this warning: ``The
potential fire hazard alone is of such proportion that numerous
lives could be lost at any time no matter how minor the fire was at
the outset.''
   ``How ironic that after so many years, we're still back where we
started,'' he said. ``Now a lot of people are going to be up in
arms over this. And then, eventually, it's going to fade _ until it
happens again.''
