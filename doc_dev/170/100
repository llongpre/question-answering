<HEAD>Reports: Dinkins To Hire More Than 1,000 New Cops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mayor David Dinkins plans to hire more than
1,000 new police officers in an effort to fight a surge in crime,
two newspapers reported today.
   The New York Post and Daily News each said that the new police
officers will be trained at the Police Academy in the October and
April classes.
   Dinkins will obtain the $50 to $60 million the plan will cost by
cutting other city services, the papers said.
   ``What we're doing is flooding the streets with cops,'' a senior
mayoral aide who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Daily
News. ``But the ambition here is to reduce the level of violent
crime, not just put more cops on the street.''
   Police Commissioner Lee Brown recently said he would need 5,000
more police to cope with the city's crime crisis.
   The plan stemmed from a weekend anti-crime meeting of the city's
top law enforcement and prosecution officials at Gracie Mansion,
both papers said.
   Under Dinkins' new plan, money would also be freed to pay for
more prosecutors, jails, court officers and probation and
correction officers.
   Details of the budget cuts needed to pay for the new police
officers were to be announced at a City Hall news conference today,
the News said.
   Dinkins has been under pressure lately to respond to a wave of
high-profile random violence.
   Among those incidents: the slayings of four children by stray
bullets, and the killings of two cab drivers, a 14-year-old boy and
a Greenwich Village executive.
   On Sunday, a man was shot in the head as he spoke on a pay
telephone in front of a token booth at a Brooklyn subway station,
police said. John Myers, 26, was killed by a single shotgun blast
to the back of his head.
   No arrests were made. Myers' brother, who was with him at the
subway stop, ran to a nearby grocery store and called police.
   And in another incident, two men were shot, one fatally, when a
gunman stepped from a car in the Bronx and fired five or six shots,
police said.
   Louis Shevalir, 44, was shot in the chest and hip and was
pronounced dead on arrival at a Bronx hospital late Sunday night.
The other man was in stable condition early today.
   No arrests were made and no motive was known, police spokeswoman
Mary Wrensen said.
