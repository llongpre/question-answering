   An illegal social club served alcohol without a
license to an already-drunk man who is accused of killing 87 people
when he torched the place, a $510 million lawsuit says.
   The lawsuit was filed Thursday as relatives and friends of
victims held funerals and wakes, and as the accused, Julio
Gonzalez, appeared in Bronx Criminal Court for a hearing.
   About 1,000 mourners gathered Thursday night outside Ortiz
Funeral Home in the Bronx for the wakes of six victims of the Happy
Land Social Club fire.
   ``We want justice,'' said Edith Melendez, the girlfriend of Luis
Drummond, who died in the fire Sunday. ``Give him (Gonzalez) to us.
We could take him to the park, pour some gasoline on him like he
did to our family and friends.''
   The suit was filed in Bronx state Supreme Court, New York's
trial-level court, by attorney Harry Lipsig on behalf of Jennie Mae
Danzler, mother of another fire victim, 31-year-old Natalie Danzler.
   The suit names as defendants the social club itself; Clarendon
Place Corp., owner of the premises; Little Peach Realty, lessee;
Alex DiLorenzo III, Jay Weiss and Morris Jaffe, officers of Little
Peach; Elena Colon, widow of club owner Elias Colon, who died in
the fire; and Gonzalez. Weiss is the husband of actress Kathleen
Turner.
   The suit seeks $10 million in compensatory damages and $500
million in punitive damages. It claims, among other things, that
Happy Land served alcohol without a license and served it to
Gonzalez when he already was intoxicated.
   Authorities Thursday continued to crack down on illegal social
clubs, with more than 100 police officers transferred from the
Tactical Narcotics Teams to a reactivated Social Club Task Force.
The force has visited hundreds of social clubs citywide since
Sunday's fire, closing about two dozen and issuing citations.
   Meanwhile, Criminal Court Judge Effrain Alvarado ruled Thursday
at hearing over legal representation of Gonzales that the Legal Aid
Society may continue as his counsel through the grand jury process.
But the judge appointed lawyer Richard Berne to take over the case
after that.
   Security was tight during the hearing. At one point, a man
yelled, ``Julio, I'm going to watch you.'' The man was a friend of
one of the fire victims.
   Gonzalez, a 36-year-old Cuban emigre, was arrested Sunday and
charged with 87 counts of murder through depraved indifference, 87
counts of felony murder, and one count of attempted murder and
arson. He allegedly set the fire after a fight with his
ex-girlfriend, who worked at the club.
   Mayor David Dinkins on Thursday contested a published report
that his director of Latino Affairs, William Nieves, had operated
an illegal social club.
   Dinkins said the establishment, called El Caney, was really a
cultural center. He acknowledged the site had been cited for
building and fire code violations and should have been closed.
   Members of the City Council grilled top city officials about the
fire Thursday during a meeting of the council's Public Safety
Committee.
   They demanded to know why Happy Land was not padlocked after the
city discovered it was operating illegally and unsafely. Fire and
buildings department officials said the law was unclear whether a
building could be padlocked without a hearing.
