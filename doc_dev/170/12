   Chicago and several New Jersey cities have begun cracking down
on illegal social clubs like New York's Happy Land, the firetrap
where 87 people died in a gasoline-fed blaze.
   Officials in many cities around the nation say they don't have
such clubs, which typically operate without licenses and stay open
after hours. But in those cities that do, Sunday's fire sent a
cautionary message.
   In New York, Mayor David Dinkins said Monday he was conferring
with the City Council speaker about legislation to regulate the
clubs, including stiffer penalties for violations.
   Dinkins acknowledged that social clubs are useful as ethnic
meeting places, but he had a message for patrons: ``I would tell
them to tell the management they're not going to frequent them
again until they make them safe again.''
   In Chicago, Building Commissioner Daniel Weil said city
officials are inspecting at least 100 registered non-profit social
clubs, and will be trying to locate any unlicensed clubs in hopes
of preventing a tragedy like the Happy Land fire.
   ``When a tragedy like this occurs, you don't want to ignore
it,'' Weil said.
   There was similar concern in several New Jersey cities.
   In Elizabeth, Mayor Thomas G. Dunn said city inspectors would
put at least seven illegal nightclubs out of business as a result
of the Happy Land fire. Two owners of one club were arrested Monday
and about 100 patrons chased from the place, he said.
   In Paterson, vice squad Sgt. Michael Recca said three or four
such establishments have been shut down in the last month.
   ``Generally the violations involve illegal alcoholic beverage
sales and with that we find a high incidence of drug sales between
patrons,'' he said.
   In Camden, Cyrus Saxon, the city's alcoholic beverage control
investigator, is seeking inspections of unlicensed social clubs in
the city. Saxon said most of the night-spots do not have liquor
licenses, but serve alcohol and cater to a dancing crowd.
   ``The problem is you don't really know,'' said Saxon. ``You
don't know if these places have enough exits or fire escapes.''
