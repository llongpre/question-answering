   Sobs and cries from hundreds of mourners rang
out at a Roman Catholic church as the caskets of 17 victims from
the Happy Land Social Club fire were arrayed in the form of a large
crucifix.
   One pink coffin for a female victim and 16 blue coffins for
males were carried Wednesday from the Rivera Funeral Home in the
Bronx across the street from St. Joseph's church.
   The dead were among 87 people, most of them Honduran immigrants,
who perished Sunday in the illegal social club that was allegedly
set afire by a spurned lover. It was the city's worst fire in 79
years.
   ``God never, never abandons us. Sudden death is also sudden
mercy,'' the Rev. Henry Hill told more than 1,000 mourners packed
inside the church.
   ``My heart goes out to each and every family,'' said Hill, a
Honduran native. ``The church understands your loss and extends its
sympathies and love.''
   Another 1,000 people unable to fit in the church huddled outside
on the street, about 10 blocks from the scene of the fire.
   The Honduran government declared three days of national mourning
Wednesday and said 78 victims had been identified as Honduran. Most
of the bodies will be buried in Honduras.
   But relatives who are illegally in the United States may not be
able to return if they travel to Honduras to attend burial services.
   Before the Mass, hundreds of mourners prayed in the funeral home
and then stood in the street. At least three women fainted and more
than 15 required medical attention.
   Jose Alvarez, who came for the wake of his brother Denny, 22,
left the funeral home sobbing and clinging to a cousin and friend.
   Across the street on the church steps, Denny's father, Pedro,
railed against the man charged with setting the blaze, 36-year-old
Cuban emigrant Julio Gonzalez.
   ``They ought to take him and give him a public hanging. People
like that don't deserve to live,'' Alvarez said.
   Roses and daffodils in vases and coffee cans were placed in
front of the the smoke-blackened red brick social club. Burned
coats, some still on hangers, lay piled against the building. A
paper sign on a tree listed the victims' names and ages.
   Nearby, family members went to a school to collect their
relatives' personal effects.
   Carlos Pena clutched a manila envelope which held a watch, keys,
and some cash his brother Eli, 26, had when he died at the club.
   The watch arrived with Eli from Honduras, and Carlos said the
timepiece would now be his. ``It means a lot, a reminder,'' he said.
   The wake at the funeral home began three hours after a Bronx
Civil Court refused to let the landlord of the social club reclaim
the establishment until it decides whether the late tenant's widow
should replace her husband in an eviction suit.
   The hearing, scheduled before the blaze Sunday whose victims
included club proprietor Elias Colon, did not delve into
responsibility for the tragedy. It only dealt with the demand of
the building's landlord, One Peach Associates, for Colon's eviction
for failing to pay rent.
   Mayor David Dinkins said legislation would be submitted today to
City Council that would impose heavy penalties on landlords and
operators of illegal social clubs.
