   At least 52 drinking and dancing clubs listed by
the city as ``nuisances'' are on city-owned properties, making
government the biggest landlord of the illegal establishments,
according to published reports.
   A crackdown began after 87 people died March 25 at the Happy
Land Social Club, an illegal social club in the Bronx, in an arson
fire that was the deadliest blaze in the United States since 1977.
   The bodies of 48 of the victims were flown Sunday from Kennedy
International Airport to Honduras aboard a DC-8 chartered by the
American Red Cross. In all, 79 of the victims were believed to be
Hondurans.
   ``Most of them went to the United States with high hopes, and
they came back dead. We are very sad,'' said Honduran President
Rafael Leonardo Callejas, who went to San Pedro Sulla to be with
dozens of grieving relatives.
   A grand jury on Friday indicted 36-year-old Cuban immigrant
Julio Gonzalez on charges of murder, arson, attempted murder and
assault. He is accused of starting the fire with gasoline after
being rejected by a former girlfriend who worked at the club.
   In the latest citywide social club sweep from Friday night to
early Sunday, Social Club Task Force members visited 356 clubs and
found 122 of them open, said police Sgt. Diane Kubler. They issued
54 vacate orders, 132 summonses and 193 notices of violation. One
person was arrested.
   Clubs such as the Wanda Social Club, which was slapped with a
vacate order Friday night, are a particular embarassment to the
city. The city is the landlord.
   The New York Times, citing police records, reported Sunday that
52 of the 1,255 clubs listed as ``nuisance'' establishments were in
properties owned by the city, including two in Housing Authority
projects. The records portray the city as the largest landlord of
such clubs.
   Buildings, finance and Department of Housing Preservation and
Development records indicated there were 46 to 66 social clubs in
city-owned buildings, department Commissioner Felice Michetti told
the Times.
   Department inspectors were surveying them, she said.
   City-owned residential buildings house as many as 46 illegal
clubs, the Daily News said Saturday, basing its report on a review
of Buildings Department and real estate records as well as reports
from inspections by city agencies.
   The News said the number could increase as city officials check
contradictory listings of illegal clubs.
   The city inherited the clubs along with vast numbers of tenants
and abandoned buildings, said Lee Jones, a spokesman for Mayor
David N. Dinkins.
   ``Is it embarrassing?'' Jones said. ``It's something we're going
to have to deal with.''
   In the event of death or injury in a fire or other calamity, the
city might be liable in lawsuits involving such establishments, the
Times said.
   Ms. Michetti said there were two grounds for city action. If the
tenant doesn't have a bona fide lease, ``we can bring an eviction
action,'' she said. Otherwise, the city can move for a vacate order
and ultimately padlock the property for violating fire and building
codes or selling alcohol without a state license.
   The city has moved against two other city-owned social club
tenants besides the Wanda, the Times said. Authorities last week
issued a vacate order for a club in Manhattan and closed another in
the Bronx.
