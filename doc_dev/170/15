   The tragedy was foretold, its prevention
attempted. But law enforcement failed customers of the Happy Land
Social Club, as experts say it is failing to protect the patrons of
other illegal nightspots.
   ``These places are fire traps. They're in violation of every
code imaginable,'' state Sen. Jeremy Weinstein, who led an
investigation of social clubs in 1981, said Monday. ``It's true for
every city in the country.''
   But it is in New York that the nightmare was realized:
Eighty-seven lives snuffed out in a rush of flame and toxic smoke
early Sunday. The Happy Land's habitues, mainly poor immigrants,
were trapped and felled in moments.
   It should not have happened. A year and a half ago, when seven
died in a similar fire, the mayor formed a task force to close down
unlicensed clubs. Soon after, the city ordered Happy Land closed
for fire safety violations.
   It apparently did close for a time _ and then opened again,
unnoticed by officialdom. ``These places reopen as fast as they
shut 'em down,'' said Charles Ryan, an ex-fire captain and now fire
science department chairman at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
   As a result, despite a renewed crackdown announced Monday, he
said, ``It wouldn't shock me if this happened again.''
   The simple problem is inadequate law enforcement, Ryan and
others said. But they also called it more complex than that _ a
combination of the city's enormous problems, shrinking budget and
paralyzing bureaucracy.
   And there is another, equally daunting factor: Tremendous demand
for the illegal but inexpensive clubs, particularly in poor
immigrant communities where life is difficult, diversions are
scarce and danger is commonplace.
   ``People who are living in tough conditions of life are going to
look for opportunities to blow off some steam,'' said Professor
William Kornblum, director of the Social Research Center at the
City University of New York's graduate school. ``They're going to
pay less attention to the dangers around them.''
   The hazards can be legion. At the Happy Land, authorities say
there was no open fire exit, no first-floor sprinkler system, no
proper emergency lights, and bars on the sole window. The only way
out was through the front door, and it was blocked by flames,
allegedly ignited by an arsonist.
   The deaths are all the more tragic for the city's failed effort
to shut the Happy Land down. ``This should never have happened,''
said Mayor David Dinkins. ``That club had been inspected. It had
been cited. And it had been ordered closed.''
   He immediately launched another crackdown, with police posting
vacate orders on 187 social clubs Sunday night.
   But vacate orders alone cannot solve the problem. ``Issuing a
piece of paper and saying, `You're closed' doesn't mean anything
unless you come around and whack the guy on the head,'' said Ryan.
   Identification of illegal clubs has been adequate, he said, with
2,031 inspections last year by the task force formed in 1988 by
then-Mayor Edward I. Koch. ``It's the follow-up that's weak,'' Ryan
said. ``That's the nut of the problem: inadequate enforcement.''
   Better enforcement would require more manpower. The police
estimate there are 1,220 social clubs in the city, with about 1,000
listed as inactive. But Happy Land was one of those ``inactive''
clubs, and Kornblum guessed the city in fact has 500 to 600
operating social clubs _ some legal, many not.
   ``It is true that complete enforcement is futile. The clubs are
always moving to new locations, always trying to stay a step or two
ahead of the authorities,'' Kornblum said. But he said aggressive
followup could save lives, if the city provided the resources.
   There are other approaches, as well. With a view of social clubs
as cultural centers, Kornblum suggested low-interest city loans for
legally operated clubs that could take the place of illegal dives.
   Ryan, for his part, suggested cracking down on the liquor
merchants who keep the clubs supplied, and possibly placing a legal
limit on retail liquor sales. Weinstein said he would investigate
the idea.
   Yet Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat, noted that little of this is
new. In 1981, his panel's report on illegal social clubs included
this warning, ``The potential fire hazard alone is of such
proportion that numerous lives could be lost at any time no matter
how minor the fire was at the outset.''
   ``How ironic that after so many years, we're still back where we
started,'' he said. ``Now a lot of people are going to be up in
arms over this. And then, eventually, it's going to fade _ until it
happens again.''
