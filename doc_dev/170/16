   Prosecutors on Tuesday investigated the tangled
ownership of the Happy Land Social Club to determine whether the
landlords, including actress Kathleen Turner's husband, share
responsibility in the fiery deaths of 87 people.
   The district attorney's office also said a grand jury had begun
hearing evidence against Julio Gonzalez, a 36-year-old Cuban emigre
who reportedly confessed to setting the fire at the illegal
discotheque early Sunday.
   ``We'll have a made case even if he backs out of the
confession,'' said Edward McCarthy, spokesman for the Bronx
prosecutor's office.
   Gonzalez allegedly bought $1 worth of gasoline and ignited it in
the doorway to the two-story unlicensed club after a fight with his
ex-girlfriend, who worked there. The club had no emergency exits
and no second-story windows; the victims had neither the time nor
the means to escape.
   The building that housed the club was leased to Happy Land's
operator by Miss Turner's husband, Jay Weiss, who in turn had
leased it from one of New York's major real estate operators, Alex
DiLorenzo III.
   McCarthy said the issue of landlord responsibility wasn't clear.
Prosecutors still had to determine whether anyone beyond the club
operator, Elias Colon, who died in the fire, knew the building had
been served with notices of building code violations.
   Weiss, through a statement by his lawyer, Roger Boyle,
acknowledged that Little Peach Realty, a company he owns with
Morris Jaffe, leased the building in 1985 from a DiLorenzo company,
Clarendon Place Corp.
   Two years later, Little Peach leased the club to Colon, but
Boyle said that since last spring the company had been trying to
evict Colon for not paying rent. The case was to have been heard in
court Wednesday.
   Boyle said Weiss would have no further statement.
   Miss Turner said through her publicist, Susan Geller in Los
Angeles: ``This is an act of a violent madman. It's a tragedy. It
doesn't reflect on me or my husband.''
   Miss Turner is in New York starring in a Broadway revival of
``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   According to Assistant Fire Chief William Feehan, inspectors are
supposed to serve notices of code violations on the responsible
person at the scene and not necessarily to building owners.
   The Happy Land tragedy spurred Mayor David Dinkins to reactivate
a police, fire and buildings department task force formed in the
wake of another fatal club fire.
   Fire Department spokesman John Mulligan said the agency received
nearly 1,000 calls Monday, the first day of operating a special
number for reports of illegal social clubs.
   Mulligan said the names and addresses of some 500 clubs were
divulged.
   ``The department is elated,'' Mulligan said. ``It shows the
public is aware of the problem now and there's not much you can do
about it unless the public gets involved.''
   The man charged with 87 counts of murder, Gonzalez, remained in
the prison ward of Kings County Hospital, awaiting his next court
appearance.
   According to District Attorney Robert Johnson, Gonzalez made
admissions to people he had spoken to after early Sunday's fire.
The district attorney said Gonzalez gave police a videotaped
confession later in the day in which he admitted he torched the
Happy Land with gasoline in a fit of pique against his former
girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano, who worked at the club.
   ``We're going to put on (the witness stand) the girlfriend, the
guy that sold him the gasoline, the two guys he talked to _ the
neighbors _ at his house,'' McCarthy said.
   ``And then we have the container that held the gasoline, his
sneakers, which were soaked with gasoline. We even cut up a hunk of
the floor and brought it in to prove the burn pattern was caused by
gasoline.''
   Ms. Feliciano escaped the fire without serious injury. One of
the four other survivors, club disc jockey Ruben Valladarez, was in
critical but stable condition at Jacobi Hospital with burns over 30
percent of this body. Hospital spokeswoman Vicki Ciampa said he had
about a 50-50 chance of survival.
