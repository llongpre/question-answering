   Prosecutors intend to use a pair of
gasoline-soaked sneakers and a hunk of dance floor to help make
their case against a man charged with setting the fire that killed
87 people in a social club.
   A grand jury Tuesday began hearing evidence against 36-year-old
Julio Gonzalez, charged with 87 murders in the blaze at the Happy
Land Social Club in the Bronx. Police said he set the fire early
Sunday after being snubbed by an ex-girlfriend who worked there.
   ``We'll have a made case even if he backs out of the
confession,'' said Edward McCarthy, spokesman for the Bronx
prosecutor's office.
   Gonzalez was transferred Tuesday to a prison unit within the
psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital, where a fellow inmate said
he raged for hours against his ex-girlfriend.
   ``He is so emotionally distraught that tears keep coming down,''
the inmate, Louis Cuascut, said in today's New York Post. ``He
seems very, very depressed.''
   The Happy Land club had been ordered closed for fire and safety
code violations and the landlord was trying to evict the owner for
non-payment of rent.
   The building that housed the illegal club was subleased to the
club's operator by a company co-owned by actress Kathleen Turner's
husband, Jay Weiss. He leased it from one of New York's biggest
landlords, Alex DiLorenzo III.
   Turner said she was shocked by the fire but that her husband
wasn't to blame.
   ``It's unfortunate that it was that building but the fact is
that you can even throw a firebomb into McDonald's and it would
have had the same result,'' Turner said outside her Manhattan
apartment, the Post reported today.
   The actress, starring in a Broadway revival of ``Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof,'' said she was afraid that people would come to her home
seeking vengeance.
   Turner also said Tuesday through her publicist, ``This is an act
of a violent madman. It's a tragedy. It doesn't reflect on me or my
husband.''
   Among those scheduled to testify against Gonzalez are his
ex-girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano, a worker at the club; and the man
who sold Gonzalez the $1 worth of gasoline he allegedly used to
start the blaze.
   ``And then we have the container that held the gasoline, his
sneakers, which were soaked with gasoline,'' McCarthy said. ``We
even cut up a hunk of the floor and brought it in to prove the burn
pattern was caused by gasoline.''
   District Attorney Robert Johnson said Gonzalez gave police a
videotaped statement in which he admitted that he torched the Happy
Land in a pique against Ms. Feliciano.
   Besides Ms. Feliciano, four other people escaped the inferno.
   Authorities had warned DiLorenzo that Happy Land was riddled
with violations, including an illegally added second floor, no
sprinklers on the first floor, no second exit and no fire alarms,
Building Commissioner Charles Smith Jr. said in today's New York
Times.
   Normally the violations report would have been forwarded by the
owner to the leaseholder, but Weiss' attorneys said they never
received a formal notice of the violations. They would not comment
on whether they knew of them.
   Weiss, through his lawyer Roger Boyle, said Tuesday that One
Peach Associates, a company he owns with Morris Jaffe, leased the
building in 1985 from DiLorenzo's Clarendon Place Corp.
   One Peach two years later leased the club to its operator, Elias
Colon, for up to $1,950 a month. Boyle said that since last spring
the company had been trying to evict Colon for not paying rent. The
case was to have been heard in court today. Colon died in the fire.
   One Peach also leased space to a second after-hours club, called
La Salsa, around the corner from Happy Land, for $2,500 a month,
the Daily News reported today.
   Neighborhood residents said La Salsa, too, was packed with
revelers Saturday night. The club has one door and no windows.
Because of fire code violations, it had been ordered to close in
August 1988.
   Because many of the fire victims were poor Honduran immigrants,
10 airlines have offered to ship the remains free from Miami to
Honduras, said Larry Mackler, a spokesman for the American Red
Cross. The Red Cross plans to fly next-of-kin back as well to make
funeral arrangements.
