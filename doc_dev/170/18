   The Happy Land social club might better have
been called The Disaster Waiting to Happen, according to city
officials.
   ``It was a fire trap,'' said Anthony De Vita, the Fire
Department's command chief.
   A fire that spread rapidly through the two-story brick building
early Sunday killed 87 people. A vengeful former boyfriend of the
club's ticket seller allegedly set the fire with gasoline.
   City inspectors had ordered the illegal club closed 16 months
ago.
   ``We close them today; they open them tomorrow,'' Deputy Fire
Commissioner Robert Ungar said.
   The club was riddled with safety faults, inspectors said. They
included:
   _Not enough exits. There were only two doors on the front of the
building, one of which was shuttered at the time of the fire. The
other was in flames.
   _Bars on the sole window, which was in the coat-check room.
   _A staircase so narrow that only one person could use it at a
time. It was so steep at 60 degrees that fire spokesman John
Mulligan said he was reminded of the stairs on a ship.
   _Employees who were unequipped and untrained to deal with fires.
   _No sprinkler system on the first floor.
   _A lack of proper emergency lighting or signs to show patrons
the way to safety.
   _No certification the structure was flameproof.
   The fire was apparently set at the front door, where Julio
Gonzalez, 36, allegedly sprinkled gasoline from a plastic jug. Only
three people were able to escape.
   ``To save themselves, they would have had to pass through the
fire to get to the exit,'' said Fire Department Chief of Operations
William Feehan.
   The club had no liquor or cabaret license. Its patrons paid a $5
entrance fee to enjoy alcohol, dance on a large upstairs dance
floor or a small one downstairs and mingle with a clientele that
included Hondurans and, more recently, other Hispanics.
   Many of its most loyal customers were from Trujillo, Honduras.
The disk jockey played music ranging from salsa and reggae to the
calypso popular on Honduras' Atlantic Coast. Patrons would knock on
the front door to be admitted before the door was closed and locked
again. It usually was open until 6 a.m.
   On Nov. 21, 1988, the city ordered it vacated.
   It was unclear if the club remained open or reopened later, but
on July 24, 1989, its manager was arrested by police and charged
with selling liquor illegally, said Buildings Commissioner Charles
Smith.
   It was ordered vacated again on Nov. 1 but it didn't stay that
way.
   Mayor David Dinkins said he didn't know the building's current
owner. Residents said the manager of the club was Elias Colon.
   One former patron, Arthur McIntyre, said he convinced his
girlfriend not to go to Happy Land Saturday night.
   ``It was a dangerous building from the beginning but it was a
lot of fun,'' he said. ``But a few months ago it got bad. People
started bringing guns and drugs and wearing knives. I figured
something was about to explode.''
   Denice Garcia, another area resident, called the club ``sleazy''
and said the building did not seem sturdy and the large dance floor
sometimes moved.
