   Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas said
Friday his country was donating $25,000 to build a recreation
center in the neighborhood where 87 people died when fire swept
through an illegal social club.
   Cardinal John O'Connor said the archdiocese of New York also was
committed to building the center to diminish the need for illegal
social clubs in the Bronx neighborhood.
   The announcements were made at a memorial Mass for the victims
of the Happy Land Social Club tragedy.
   Callejas told the more than 750 people inside St. Thomas Aquinas
Church and more than 100 people listening through loudspeakers
outside that the Honduran people raised the money, and that $1,000
of it was from his own pocket.
   O'Connor said the church would match the contribution if the
city would donate the land. He promised to donate $999.99 of his
own.
   Most of the 87 people who died March 25 when fire ravaged the
club were Honduran immigrants.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, a Cuban immigrant, has been charged with
setting the blaze.
   The Mass, originally scheduled for Sunday at St. Patrick's
Cathedral, was shifted to St. Thomas, two blocks from the gutted
social club building, so Callejas could attend, officials said.
   ``Too many immigrants in our country are forced to live in
crowded, inadequate and dangerous housing conditions,'' O'Connor,
speaking in Spanish, told families and friends of the victims.
   These immigrants have menial jobs because they are illegal, and
``it comes as no surprise that they are forced to use crowded and
dangerous facilities for various forms of social activities because
they are so poor,'' O'Connor said.
   Callejas told the crowd that ``we are together in your pain.''
