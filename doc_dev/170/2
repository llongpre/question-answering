   Inspectors this morning visited more than 200
social clubs in a crackdown ordered by Mayor David Dinkins
following the deadliest city fire in 79 years. Only a fraction of
them were found to be open, but 52 safety violations were cited,
authorities said.
   ``I will tell you it will not be an endless battle,'' Dinkins
said Sunday after touring the charred Happy Land social club in the
Bronx. ``Anybody that had an opportunity to view those 87 bodies
knows that we're not going to tolerate this.''
   Previous mayors have waged a long and unsuccessful battle to
close clubs that are operating illegally. The dancing and drinking
nightspots are popular among immigrants because they are cheap.
   A task force put together by then-Mayor Edward Koch after a 1988
Bronx social club fire that killed seven people will be beefed up,
Dinkins said. Before Sunday's fire, only one team remained from the
10-team task force.
   A sweep of social clubs was conducted between midnight and 7
a.m., police said.
   Officers and task force inspectors went to 241 suspected illegal
clubs citywide and posted vacate orders at 187 of them, said Sgt.
Dick Vreeland, a police spokesman. In most cases, the orders were
posted on closed doors, because just 23 of the clubs were found to
be open for business. Fifty-two safety violations and 30 summonses
were issued.
   During the sweep, five people were arrested for weapons
possession, 11 loaded firearms recovered, cars were towed and
parking tickets issued.
   Sunday morning, in raids unrelated to the fire, a police task
force raided several social clubs in Brooklyn and arrested five
people for weapons possession, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a police
spokeswoman.
   Albert Scardino, the mayor's press secretary, said police list
about 1,220 clubs without liquor licenses, with about 1,000
considered inactive. The Happy Land was considered inactive.
   ``They range from a group of elderly men who get together to
play cards and watch a ballgame on a Sunday afternoon to
full-fledged nightclub operations,'' said Richard Chernela, a state
Liquor Authority spokesman.
   The number of clubs citywide is hard to pin down since they can
spring up overnight, often in a dank basement or abandoned building.
   A review of city records Sunday turned up 173 social clubs that
had been ordered vacated. Inspectors were told to make sure the 173
are closed. There was no immediate explanation of how other clubs
visited today were selected.
   If the illegal clubs are not shut immediately, Dinkins had said,
``we'll see to it that they certainly aren't open come the next
weekend.''
   Sunday's fire occurred 79 years to the day after a blaze at the
Triangle Shirtwaist Co. in New York City that claimed 145 lives,
many of them immigrant garment workers. That blaze led to reforms
around the nation in workplace safety.
   Just about anyone can go to a social club, despite the term's
implication of exclusivity. The Happy Land charged $5 for admission.
   Despite periodic campaigns to close them, many of the clubs have
become centers of urban problems, from noise and double-parking to
gambling, prostitution and drug dealing.
   The clubs often are rife with building, health and fire code
violations that can lead to tragedy. Five people died in a Brooklyn
club fire in 1985, and 25 people were killed in a Bronx fire in
1976.
   ``People are literally taking their lives in their hands at
these clubs,'' Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said.
   Dinkins said a vacate order was issued in November 1988 against
the Happy Land because the club did not have a proper sprinkler
system, exits, emergency lighting and signs.
   City records show an arrest was made there on July 24 and the
club was closed again on Nov. 1, he said.
   City officials said the building was sold last year to Karl
Rubman, but Dinkins said it was unclear who owns the property now.
Residents said the manager of the club was Elias Colon. The Daily
News reported that Colon's wife, Elena, was one of the survivors of
the fire.
   Some said it may be impossible to close the social clubs
completely.
   ``Our experience in the city in the last 20 years demonstrates
that clearly,'' said William Kornblum, director of the Center for
Social Research at the City University of New York Graduate School.
   Many people, especially those from poor neighborhoods where
affordable alternatives are scarce, go to the clubs looking for a
place to socialize where they feel welcome.
   Some clubs are closed under the city's 1984 padlock law, which
allows police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are
committed on the site within a 12-month period.
   But the owners, if they can be located, are rarely convicted.
   Even when the clubs are shuttered, an owner may reopen around
the corner or down the street, attracting the same crowd.
