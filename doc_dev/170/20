   Jose Ambrosio Alvarez left for
the United States three years ago with cooking skills learned in a
hospital kitchen and an immigrant's dream of a better life.
   On Sunday, his body was returned in a plain wooden box along
with the bodies of 47 other Hondurans killed with him in a blaze at
an illegal New York social club.
   ``You leave here with such high hopes of better things,'' said
his 32-year-old brother, Gerardo Alvarez. ``This has been a
terrible blow to us.''
   At least 79 of the 87 people killed in the March 25 fire at the
Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx were Hondurans. Authorities
have said a Cuban immigrant set the blaze after being spurned by
his girlfriend, a club employee. The Happy Land club was a
home-away-from-home for Honduran immigrants, who went there to
dance, chat and drink.
   The coffins on Sunday arrived in the northern industrial city of
San Pedro Sula aboard a DC-8 transport plane chartered by the Red
Cross.
   The victims, mostly young people in their late teens and early
20s, were largely poor immigrants from San Pedro Sula and towns
dotting Honduras' Atlantic coast such as Puerto Cortes, Tela, La
Ceiba, Trujillo.
   The story of 27-year-old Jose Alvarez is familiar in these parts
of high unemployment, low wages and wide poverty.
   Clothing and furniture factories and food packing plants are San
Pedro Sula's backbone. But the jobs they provide are far fewer than
the numbers of poor from outlying areas who flock to the city
looking for work.
   At the airport early Sunday, family members clung to each other
for support as an orange forklift unloaded the coffins four at a
time. The coffins were laid in rows on the airport tarmac before
the grief-stricken families.
   Wreaths were laid atop each box and the Roman Catholic bishop of
San Pedro Sula, Monsignor Jaime Brufeau, said a brief Mass.
   ``Most of them went to the United States with high hopes, and
they come back dead. We are very sad,'' said President Rafael
Leonardo Callejas, who came to San Pedro Sula to be with dozens of
mourning relatives.
   Army helicopters were to fly some bodies to the victims' home
towns. Others were simply carried away by their families.
   Many relatives, who stood at the airport under a hot tropical
sun for more than two hours, collapsed and were carried away by
Honduran Red Cross volunteers.
   One man's grief broke into fury toward the suspected arsonist.
   ``Damned Cuban, I'll kill you!'' shouted Juan Alberto Pena, 19,
clenching his fist. Pena, of Progreso, was at the airport awaiting
the body of his brother, Jeremias.
   On Friday, Cuban immigrant Julio Gonzalez, 36, was indicted by a
New York state grand jury on 178 counts of murder, arson and other
charges. Authorities say he set the fire at the Happy Land club
with gasoline from a nearby gas station.
   Some relatives said they were preparing to file lawsuits.
   ``We have made our decision,'' a grim-faced Gregorio Hernandez
said. His nephew, 24-year-old Jose Manuel Marquez Hernandez, was a
victim.
   ``We're going to sue the city (of New York), the gas station and
the owners of the building,'' Hernandez said.
   Wakes and funerals were scheduled for today and Tuesday in
surrounding towns.
