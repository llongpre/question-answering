   The car slowed on the rain-slicked Bronx street
as its occupants pointed and stared at the charred building that
once housed the Happy Land Social Club.
   Others stopped off Friday night to add their contribution to a
burgeoning memorial of flowers and funeral wreaths laid out on the
sidewalk.
   Like a peculiar urban pilgrimage, the scene is repeated over and
over as friends and neighbors, mourners and the merely curious come
to see where 87 people died in last Sunday's fire at the illegal
social club.
   Robert Robayo and his wife, Estella, somberly stood in the
drizzle and stared blankly at charred coats that lay unclaimed
behind the flowers.
   ``I can't believe they had so many people in there. It looks so
small,'' Robayo said. ``They should never have had so many people
in there.''
   In the week since the disaster, the city has cracked down on
illegal social clubs, beefing up enforcement by transferring more
than 100 police officers from a special anti-drug squad.
   In raids Thursday night and Friday morning, police found 74 of
89 clubs they visited closed. They served 17 summonses and 36
notices for building and fire code infractions at 15 others.
   At least four illegal clubs in the Washington Heights section of
Manhattan did not open this weekend because of the crackdown.
   The four clubs, said a source familiar with their operation who
spoke on condition of anonymity, usually buy just enough liquor for
the weekend but opted not to buy any liquor or to open this weekend.
   A woman stood outside what has become the city's best-known
club, shaking her head as she recalled the numerous times she
danced there. Safety never occurred to her.
   ``You're in there drinking. You're dancing. You're not thinking
about that,'' said the woman, who would identify herself only as
Celeste. ``But now, when I go to other clubs, I'm going to look and
see if they have a rear exit.'' Were it not for the small group of
firefighters and police officers assigned to protect the building,
Happy Land might seem like just another charred building in the
Bronx. The East Tremont section where the building sits is bleak,
with littered, vacant lots next to deteriorated buildings.
   At the Virgin Islands American Bar on East Tremont, a block from
Happy Land, several patrons said they had never previously heard of
the club.
   ``I couldn't even tell if the place was open or not,'' said the
bar's manager, who would identify herself only as Shirley.
   But a woman who visited the building insisted everyone in the
area knew about Happy Land.
   ``How could you not know about it? It was like the only place
you could go to around here and afford,'' said the woman, who would
not give her name.
   ``Some are dropping off flowers. Others just stop and say a
prayer,'' said Fire Marshal Larry Lynch of the steady stream of
visitors.
   One onlooker asked if the neighborhood was returning to normal.
   ``Are you kidding? This place is never normal. This is the
Bronx,'' answered a man who identified himself as Alberto.
   Alberto, who was walking around trying to sell two pairs of used
trousers and slippers, stared across the street at the Happy Land
building.
   ``Look, the drugs are still here. People are still scared to go
out in the street. Some of these young kids are crazy and will
stick you for nothing. No. Nothing's changed here. It's just gone
from bad to worse.''
