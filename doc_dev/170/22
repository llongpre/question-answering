   The man accused of starting a nightclub fire
that killed 87 people in the deadliest U.S. blaze in 13 years
pleaded innocent Wednesday to 174 murder charges and other counts.
   Julio Gonzalez, guarded by four marshals and speaking through a
Spanish translator, mumbled ``no culpable'' when asked how he
pleaded to the charges during his arraignment in the borough of the
Bronx.
   Gonzalez, 36, is accused of setting the March 25 fire that raced
through the Happy Land social club, trapping most patrons on the
second floor of the tiny, illegal establishment and killing 87
people, mostly Honduran immigrants. Only five people escaped the
deadliest blaze since a 1977 nightclub fire in Southgate, Ky.
   A grand jury indicted Gonzalez on double murder charges for each
victim, one for murder by arson and the other for murder by
depraved indifference. He also was charged with two counts of arson
and one each of assault and attempted murder.
   At the time, there was speculation that Gonzalez could be
sentenced to several thousand years in prison if convicted on all
charges.
   But state Judge Burton R. Roberts said Wednesday that Gonzalez
could be sentenced to only one term of 25 years to life and might
be eligible for parole in 25 years even if convicted on all murder
charges. Roberts said that under state law, when there are two or
more victims from a single crime, sentences must run concurrently
rather than consecutively, as in separate crimes.
   The judge acknowledged that the social club fire was a special
case, but said he wanted to dispel misconceptions about a possible
penalty.
   Roberts set the next court appearance for April 25. ``I
understand we're a long way from trial,'' the judge said.
   Gonzalez is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation at Bellevue
Hospital.
   Assistant District Attorney Eric Warner gave Gonzalez'
court-appointed attorney, Richard W. Berne, transcripts of a
videotaped statement in which Gonzalez, according to police, admits
setting the fire after a fight with a former girlfriend working at
the club. Warner said he would also give Berne the videotape to
copy.
   Berne said he planned to move for dismissal of all charges on
grounds he was not given access to the taped statement before
having to decide whether his client should testify before the grand
jury. Gonzalez did not appear before the panel.
   Berne conceded his motion to dismiss, even if granted, was a
``procedural matter'' and that the prosecution would be sure to
request a new indictment of Gonzalez.
