<LEADPARA>  The man who set a fire that killed 87 people at a social club received
Thursday the maximum sentence for murder: 25 years to life in prison.;  
Before issuing the sentence, Chief Judge Burton Roberts of the trial-level
Bronx State Supreme Court said so many people had died that "it becomes sort
of distant. We can't recognize the horrendous tragedy."  </LEADPARA>

THAT KILLED 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Julio Gonzalez, 37, was convicted of 174 counts of murder -- two counts for
each death. He got 25 years to life for each count, but the sentences will run
concurrently.;   Under state law, when multiple crimes arise out of a single
act, sentences cannot be consecutive. He will be eligible for parole in 25
years.;   Fight with ex-girlfriend; Gonzalez set the fire at the Happy Land
club in the Bronx on March 25, 1990, after he had a fight with an
ex-girlfriend who worked there and was kicked out by a bouncer.;   Attending
the sentencing were nearly 100 relatives and friends of the victims, many of
whom were immigrants from Honduras. They applauded loudly at the sentence.;  
"I hope that he rots in jail," said Maria Clavijo, whose teen-age brother,
Juan Jose Nunez, died in the fire.;   Some were unhappy with the sentence,
even though it was the maximum permitted by law.;   "It's not enough -- he
deserved the death penalty," said Aracely Sanchez, who lost several cousins
and friends in the fire.;   Victims' stories; Before the sentencing, Roberts
recounted the stories of some of the victims. They included a sister and
brother who had been sending $200 every two weeks to their mother in Honduras
and a man who worked two jobs as a dishwasher and factory worker and who had a
pregnant wife.;   The club had been ordered closed for fire safety code
violations months before the blaze.;   "There are many to be blamed, not just
Julio Gonzalez with a 79 IQ who lost his head because he was insulted in front
of his live-in girlfriend," Roberts said.;   The fire spurred city officials
to create a Social Club Task Force that closed hundreds of illegal, unsafe
clubs around the city.;   Gasoline and matches; "There never should be a
tragedy such as this, which can be caused by a dollar's worth of gasoline and
two matches," Roberts said.;   The two counts of murder for each death
included one for depraved indifference and one for felony murder. Roberts also
sentenced Gonzalez to 25 years to life for arson and five to 15 years for
assault.;   Gonzalez told the judge he wanted to retain his attorney, Richard
Bern, to file an appeal.;   The jury rejected the defense argument that
Gonzalez was insane the night of the fire.;   District Attorney Robert Johnson
also said the state's maximum penalty was not enough. "There should be life
without parole," he said.  </TEXT>
