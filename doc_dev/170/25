   The man accused of killing 87 people by torching
an illegal social club in a jealous rage was indicted on 178 counts
of murder, arson and other charges Friday.
   A state grand jury indicted Julio Gonzalez on one count of
second-degree murder and one count of murder in the commission of a
felony for each person killed inside the Happy Land Social Club in
the Bronx.
   He also was indicted on two counts of arson and single counts of
attempted murder and assault. The defendant wasn't present when the
indictment was returned.
   Gonzalez, 36, who is due back in court April 12, could face a
sentence of 25 years to life if convicted on all counts in the
case, said Assistant District Attorney Eric Warner. If a judge made
the sentences run consecutively, he could receive a 2,000-year term.
   ``No case is open and shut,'' Warner said. ``We have a very good
case. The evidence is strong.''
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said it is
``conceivable'' that Gonzalez could be convicted of two murder
counts for each victim, but he said a jury ``probably would have to
choose between the two.''
   Gonzalez, a Cuban immigrant, opted against testifying before the
panel, said his court-appointed attorney, Richard W. Berne.
   While the grand jury considered the charges, authorities
released records indicating that one of the club's landlords was
contacted by a fire lieutenant eight months before the blaze and
told a vacate order was in effect against the building.
   Morris Jaffe, a partner in Little Peach Realty, responded that
the problem ``would be taken care of,'' according to a July 28,
1989, Fire Department document. Jaffe and Jay Weiss, the husband of
actress Kathleen Turner, are partners in Little Peach.
   Jaffe didn't return telephone messages left at his office Friday
seeking comment on the report.
   Weiss, Jaffe and their company were named in two more
multimillion-dollar negligence lawsuits filed Friday on behalf of
the families of fire victims. Also named were the club itself; the
building's owner of record, Alex DiLorenzo; and the City of New
York.
   One lawsuit asks for $100 million in damages; the second asks
for $57 million. Both were filed in Manhattan's federal court. The
day before, a $510 million lawsuit was filed by the mother of
another victim.
   Friday was the deadline for an indictment of Gonzalez, who has
been held on murder and arson charges since Sunday. He had not
entered a plea in the case because he hadn't been indicted.
   Gonzalez, brought to court earlier in the day on another matter,
was returned to Bellevue Hospital, where he was under 24-hour
watch. A shotgun-wielding correction officer accompanied the
suspect back and forth from the court, and no other prisoners are
permitted within 20 feet of him at Bellevue, his lawyer said.
   Berne said he hoped to arrange a psychiatric examination for
Gonzalez soon.
   ``Obviously, one potential avenue of defense is psychiatric,''
said Berne. ``It's always a possible defense. Now I'm looking
through doors, and I will (decide) ... which door I want to walk
through.''
   Berne said Gonzalez was exhausted when they met Thursday night.
   ``Imagine what he's been through. He's very tired,'' Berne told
reporters at state court in the Bronx.
   Gonzalez, enraged by a girlfriend's rejection, spilled gasoline
in the entrance to the Happy Land social club early Sunday and set
it ablaze, authorities said. Eighty-seven patrons died inside the
cramped club, which catered largely to immigrants from Honduras.
   His attorney said he was going into the case without any
preconceptions.
   ``All you hear at this stage is the worst of everything. I
wouldn't be a very good lawyer if I rendered a decision on what
I've read in the newspapers,'' Berne said.
   The Red Cross was preparing a charter flight to carry more than
40 bodies back to Honduras Saturday. In Albany, the New York
National Guard said the Honduran government had withdrawn a request
for its help in transporting victims' bodies.
   Six victims were buried Friday at St. Raymond's Cemetery in the
Bronx, and dozens of mourners attended a wake Friday evening for
three others.
   One of the few patrons to survive the fire, meanwhile, was
interviewed about the scene at Happy Land when the fire broke out.
   Felipe Figueroa said the club's disc jockey, Ruben Valladares,
was playing a Jamaican reggae song when the club doorman rushed up
the deadly narrow staircase yelling, ``Fuego! fuego!'' or fire,
fire.
   ``Right away, people went crazy,'' he said in the interview with
The New York Times. ``Everybody was running around.''
   He said he made his way down a narrow staircase and out the
door, and then saw Valladares, who was a friend of his, come out in
flames. The disc jockey remains hospitalized with burns over 40
percent of his body.
   ``My mind can't stop,'' Figueroa said. ``All the screams, all
the noise, and the moment when my friend came out of there
screaming. I can't forget that.''
   Authorities are unsure how many people survived but most
accounts put the number at five or six.
