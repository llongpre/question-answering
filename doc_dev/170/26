   Officials in Chicago and Elizabeth, N.J., ordered a crackdown on
illegal social clubs to prevent a disastrous fire like the one that
killed 87 people in New York. But few other cities consider such
clubs to be a problem.
   ``When a tragedy like this occurs, you don't want to ignore
it,'' Daniel Weil, Chicago's building commissioner, said Monday.
   At least 100 non-profit social clubs in Chicago that are
registered with the secretary of state will be inspected for
hazardous materials and adequate safety systems, Weil said.
   City officials said they also are trying to locate any
unlicensed centers that would be more likely to have code
violations that could lead to a tragedy like the one early Sunday
in New York.
   In Elizabeth, Mayor Thomas G. Dunn said city inspectors would
put at least seven illegal nightclubs out of business in light of
new attention drawn by the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx.
   Two owners of one club were arrested Monday and about 100
patrons chased from the place, he said.
   In Paterson, N.J., vice squad Sgt. Michael Recca said three or
four such establishments have been shut down in the last month.
   ``Generally the violations involve illegal alcoholic beverage
sales and with that we find a high incidence of drug sales between
patrons,'' he said.
   Most cities have stiff laws prohibiting selling liquor without a
license.
   ``If you operate in Texas without a license, you get put in
jail,'' said E.P. McCracken, regional supervisor of the Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission in Dallas. ``We don't run our
business in Texas like they do in New York.''
   New York officials say there are literally hundreds of clubs
like Happy Land, a firetrap that attracted a largely poor,
immigrant Hispanic crowd.
   The fire _ allegedly set by the former boyfriend of a club
employee _ prompted a new round of promises by city officials to
crack down on clubs that offer dancing and drinking to the city's
poor.
   Illegal clubs have been a nagging headache to fire, building and
liquor officials in Los Angeles, Omaha, Neb., Gary and East
Chicago, Ill., and Lawrence, Mass.
   ``We arrest them on misdemeanor charges, and they can open up
again in a week,'' Omaha police Lt. John Beers said.
   Omaha police found a locked front door and about 220 people in
two small rooms when they raided the Dirty Dozen Motorcycle Club
Sunday. ``If there had been a rush to get out, those people would
have been trampled,'' Beers said.
   In Lawrence, Mass., outside Boston, there may be three or four
illegal clubs operating, Fire Chief Raymond Johnson estimated.
   ``We shut them down and two weeks later they open someplace
else,'' Johnson said. ``I guess it's a very lucrative business.''
   In Los Angeles, a prominent club owner said aggressive
crackdowns on unsafe or illegal nightclubs have failed to stop chic
underground clubs from flourishing and evading detection by fire
officials.
   ``I myself go to these places,'' said Steve Banerjee, who owns
legal Chippendales clubs on both coasts. ``It's the whole theory of
do something you shouldn't do. You think you are part of the `in'
crowd, the `aware' crowd.'' Many big-city officials say they seldom
or never see such establishments.
   ``That's bootlegging in Texas and we would shut them down,''
said Randy Yarbrough, assistant administrator for the Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Officials in Boston, Detroit, San
Francisco and Orange County, Calif., were among those saying they
didn't believe their cities had a problem with illegal clubs.
   Some officials hoped news of the Happy Land disaster could boost
support for inspection efforts for legal and illegal clubs alike.
   Said Lawrence Fire Chief Johnson: ``Now they will use this as an
example.''
