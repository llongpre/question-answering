   Distant from Manhattan's shining skyscrapers
lies the darker side of New York City real estate, a place where
buildings crumble from neglect, where drugs are dealt, where
unlicensed bars sometimes turn into infernos.
   The Happy Land social club in the Bronx, where 87 revelers were
killed March 25 in New York City's deadliest fire in 79 years, was
a firetrap like hundreds of other illegal clubs in poorer
neighborhoods. And the city knew it.
   But these bars are as profitable as they are dangerous, experts
say, and that is why they flourish in the shadows _ poorly
regulated, operated on the cheap, tolerated by landlords seeking
what cash they can find.
   ``You own a building. You can't rent it. All of a sudden a guy
comes along and offers you $2,000 a month for it,'' said Barry
Levites, a real estate manager and former president of the Bronx
borough's Board of Realtors. ``Ninety percent of the time, nobody
even asks what he wants it for.''
   That passes for a business ethic on the unglamorous side of the
block.
   ``There is a tendency to find things that you don't expect''
from tenants, said Morris Sopher, a Bronx owner listed as having
two illegal social clubs in his buildings. ``They may open a
grocery store up front. But then they make a partition 40 feet back
and they start having gatherings.''
   ``Say I rent to a guy and he starts doing illegal things,'' said
James J. Houlihan, another real estate owner with some holdings in
poorer areas. ``How am I supposed to be responsible for it?''
   But some landlords may share the blame. While some clubs are
concealed, many illegal nightspots operate openly, with a sign out
front and music blaring. Some are centers of drug traffic.
Prostitutes frequent others.
   ``A lot of landlords will rent to unsavory characters without
getting directly involved, without wanting to know what's going on,
making a lot of money and opening their eyes only when the police
come along,'' said Douglas Kellner, a veteran tenant rights lawyer.
``Then they self-righteously take steps to clean it up.''
   He said landlords in poor neighborhoods include slumlords who
collect what rental cash they can while allowing buildings to
deteriorate, small-time owners unschooled in building management,
and real estate companies that provide minimum service while
seeking the maximum profit.
   Perhaps the biggest owner is the city, which takes over
buildings for unpaid taxes. Police records say social clubs operate
even in some city-owned buildings _ by one estimate, more than 50.
   In some cases where private owners remain, ``the rents are
extortionate,'' said Jane Benedict, a leader of the Metropolitan
Council on Housing, a tenant rights group. ``But there's no place
else for the people to go.'' The city does not regulate commercial
rents.
   The Happy Land rented for $1,950 a month, easy money to recover
in a club charging a $5 entrance fee and $3 per drink. To maximize
profit, many clubs pour cheap booze from refilled bottles.
   ``Anybody who thinks that because a bottle says Dewar's he's
getting Dewar's ought to go to the hospital for a mental
examination,'' said Inspector Frank Biehler, commander of the
Police Department's Social Club Task Force.
   The Happy Land lacked a fire exit and first-floor sprinkler
system; once flames blocked the front door, there was no way out.
The city ordered the club closed in November 1988 for fire code
violations, and it apparently closed for a time, but then reopened.
   The city said it sent its vacate order to the building's owner,
Alex DiLorenzo III, and that a firefighter discussed the issue with
Morris Jaffe, a real estate manager who leased a block of buildings
including the Happy Land from DiLorenzo. Lawyers for DiLorenzo and
Jaffe did not return calls.
   DiLorenzo is part heir to one of the city's largest real estate
fortunes.
   Levites, the real estate manager, called it unusual for someone
of DiLorenzo's prominence to own property in impoverished areas.
``They can play the big game in Manhattan,'' he said. ``Why bother
with something like this?''
   More common are owners such as Sopher, who said he owns nearly
60 Bronx commercial buildings, and others who own just one or
several properties.
   Sopher said he never was notified by the city that it had found
illegal clubs in two of his buildings, and that he learned of it
only last week when reporters called. He said he would move to
evict them, but complained that court protections for tenants can
delay evictions a year or more.
   ``My responsibility is to come around, which I do, bother them,
harass them. I don't have any police powers. I can go to court, but
the courts are totally consumer and tenant oriented,'' he said.
``It's almost impossible to get out a bad tenant.''
   Sopher and his colleague also laid some of the blame for illegal
clubs on the city, which they said failed to enforce the vacate
orders that help rid them of unwanted tenants. Inspectors rarely
return, they said; police and firefighters never check up.
   Happy Land had a sign in front, complete with a smiling ``happy
face'' symbol. ``You're going to tell me the cops in the area
didn't know this was going on?'' Levites said. ``The Fire
Department didn't know what was going on? They didn't notice?
   ``Who's supposed to police these people? Well, the blame can go
all over.''
