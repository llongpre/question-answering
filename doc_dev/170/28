   New York City's government has been branded the
largest single landlord of illegal social clubs.
   At least 52 social clubs listed by the city as ``nuisance''
establishments are on city-owned property, according to reports
published in weekend newspapers.
   A police crackdown on the clubs started after 87 people, mostly
Hondurans, died March 25 in an arson fire at the illegal Happy Land
Social Club in the Tremont section of the Bronx.
   The bodies of 48 of the victims arrived Sunday in Honduras for
burial.
   ``Most of them went to the United States with high hopes, and
they came back dead. We are very sad,'' said President Rafael
Leonardo Callejas, who joined dozens of mourning relatives at the
airport at San Pedro Sula.
   Wakes and funerals were scheduled in 11 towns in northern
Honduras.
   The New York Times said Sunday that police documents list at
least 52 clubs as ``nuisance'' establishments in properties owned
by the city, including two in city housing projects. That would
make the city the largest single landlord of such clubs.
   In late editions Saturday, the Daily News reported that as many
as 46 illegal clubs are located in city-owned residential
buildings. It based its report on a review of Buildings Department
and real estate records as well as inspections by city agencies.
   Lee Jones, a spokesman for Mayor David Dinkins, said the city
inherited the clubs along with vast numbers of tenants and
abandoned buildings.
   ``Is it embarrassing?'' Jones said. ``It's something we're going
to have to deal with.''
