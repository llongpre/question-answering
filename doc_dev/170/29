   A man charged in an illegal nightspot fire that
killed 87 people pleaded innocent today to 174 counts of murder and
other charges.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was guarded by four armed court officers as
he was arraigned before Judge Burton R. Roberts in trial-level
state Supreme Court.
   Gonzalez, who spoke to the court through a Spanish translator,
mumbled ``no culpable'' when asked how he pleaded on the charges.
   The judge told attorneys that under state law, Gonzalez could
serve only a single 25 years-to-life sentence even if convicted on
all charges. The law stipulates his sentences would have to run
concurrently, Roberts said.
   Gonzalez is accused of setting a fire that trapped revelers
inside the tiny Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx.
   Authorities charge that the Cuban immigrant, enraged by the
rejection of a former girlfriend who worked at the club, bought $1
worth of gasoline, spilled it in the illegal club's doorway and set
it aflame. Only five people escaped the cramped club following the
4 a.m. fire, including the girlfriend.
   Court-appointed defense attorney Richard W. Berne said today he
had not decided whether to use an insanity defense for his client,
although he had indicated earlier that was a possibility.
   Berne said he plans to ask for a dismissal of all charges
against Gonzalez because the lawyer was not given access to a
videotaped confession by his client when the case was submitted to
the grand jury.
   Gonzalez was indicted March 30 on 174 counts of murder, two
counts of arson and single counts of attempted murder and assault.
He was charged with two separate murder counts for each of the
victims killed in the social club blaze.
   The club lacked proper permits and did not have adequate exits
and sprinkling systems.
