<HEAD>Newspaper: Arrest Warrant Was Outstanding For Happy Land Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arrest warrant was issued last year for the
owner of the building that housed a club where 87 people died by
fire, but he never was arrested, city records show.
   A Bronx criminal judge issued the warrant after the owner, Alex
DiLorenzo III, failed to appear for a hearing on fire code
violations at the illegal social club, The New York Times reported
in today's editions.
   The warrant for DiLorenzo, who is an heir to one of the city's
largest real estate fortunes, was low priority and never was
enforced, police said.
   ``We are interested in all warrants,'' said Lt. Raymond
O'Donnell, a police spokesman. ``But we are more interested in
going after the guy who has committed a murder over a guy who has
violations in a building.''
   Of 100,000 yearly arrest warrants, those for building code
violations are among the lowest priority, O'Donnell said.
   The warrant for DiLorenzo was issued Feb. 3, 1989, by Bronx
Criminal Court Judge James E. Robinson. The violations listed in
the warrant carried a fine of up to $5,000 and 90 days in jail.
   The club lacked adequate sprinklers, emergency lighting and an
assembly permit for the entertainment of more than 75 people.
   A task force created by the city in 1988 after another fatal
social club fire inspected Happy Land on Nov. 20, 1988, and ordered
it closed.
   DiLorenzo has not returned telephone calls placed to his office
over the past several days, the newspaper said.
   The man who allegedly set the fire, Julio Gonzalez, was being
held in the psychiatric unit in the prison wing at Bellevue
Hospital.
   A friend of Gonzalez's, Juana Ortiz, told the New York Post he
was stricken with grief when told that one of his best friends died
in the March 25 fire at Happy Land Social Club.
   The friend, identified only as Ramon, had comforted Gonzalez
after he was evicted by the club's bouncer before the fire, Ms.
Ortiz said.
   She said when she told Gonzlalez that Ramon had died, he shouted
``Oh my God! Please forgive me!'' and broke down sobbing, the
newspaper reported in today's editions.
   Ortiz said Gonzalez is resigned to punishment and spends his day
reading a Spanish-language Bible.
