   Wails and cries echoed from inside a school
where friends and relatives gathered to confirm their worst fears _
that one of the 87 who died in a Bronx fire was their daughter,
husband, lover.
   Many emerged pale and distraught from Public School 67 after
identifying dead family members in photos.
   A Honduran flag was draped over a fence outside the school; many
of those who died were immigrants from Honduras.
   ``They tried to live the American dream: to get a job and make
something of themselves,'' said Cheo Garcia, a former patron of the
Happy Land social club.
   ``They all dreamed of returning home _ but with more money,''
said Miguel Reyes, coach of Club Deportivo Adrana, an amateur
soccer team.
   Reyes counted team members among the dead: Orvin Garbutt, 22,
Bagoberto Echeverri, 18, and a third player, all from Puerto
Cortez, Honduras.
   They lived in East Tremont, a neighborhood populated by
Hondurans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans and Ecuadorans.
   The area is blighted by poor housing, drugs, unemployment and
truancy. Graffitti marred the rolled-down security gates on Sunday
as trash blew down streets and across vacant lots. A rat lay dead
on the sidewalk.
   Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said the neighborhood
did not have an especially high crime rate. But some young men were
snorting cocaine in full view of police officers.
   Residents are trying to renovate the impoverished area, said the
Rev. Ruben Diaz of the Christian Community Benevolent Association,
a Protestant group.
   On Saturday nights, some took a break and flocked to an illegal
social club called Happy Land.
   ``We have to try hard to close these places. They are killing
our people,'' Diaz said. ``Sometimes we say, let them have it
because they have nothing better. Now we have to say, 'What is more
important, to have a good time or to stay alive?'''
   About 1,000 people gathered outside Happy Land, next to a union
hiring hall where the victims' bodies were assembled in rows on the
floor.
   Loved ones were allowed through police lines to look at the
photos at P.S. 67.
   ``We're looking for friends and relatives and nobody's telling
us anything,'' complained Rosemary Green, who believed her
sister-in-law and cousin had gone to Happy Land.
   ``It's a slow process,'' said the Rev. A.B. Duncans, pastor of
the nearby First Glorious Church Inc., who was assisting and
counseling some of the bereaved.
   One woman collapsed on the sidewalk outside the school and had
to be helped inside, where her son's picture was displayed with
those of other victims.
   Jorge Pineda lost five friends, all from Honduras.
   A friend called Pineda's apartment at 8 p.m. Saturday, and asked
his wife if he was going, as usual, to the Saturday night dance.
   Pineda's wife hung up; she didn't approve of the place. Eight
hours later, Pineda was identifying his friends' bodies from police
photos.
   ``I'm the only friend they had,'' he said.
