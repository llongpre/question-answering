<HEAD>Report: Lawyer Who Filed Club's Papers Is A Cop</HEAD>

   The lawyer who filed incorporation papers for
the Bronx social club where 87 people died in a fire is a city
police lieutenant who is now himself under investigation, according
to a published report.
   Lt. Primo Flores was moonlighting as a lawyer when he listed the
Happy Land club as a not-for-profit corporation in the 1988 papers,
The New York Times reported in Thursday editions.
   Nothing suggests Flores knew the club would sell liquor
illegally and operate in violation of city orders that it close
because of building violations, the Times said.
   Police told the Times that the investigation is aimed at
determining whether Flores adhered to departmental requirements to
disclose his outside business activities and whether he had
committed any wrongdoing in his work for the club.
   Flores' role in setting up the club has been under investigation
by the Police Department's Internal Affairs Division since shortly
after the March 25 fire, the Times said.
   The 48-year-old Flores, a policeman since 1967, works in the
Police Department's Advocate office, which prosecutes departmental
charges against police officers accused of breaking regulations.
   Flores did not return calls requesting comment, the Times said.
   A Cuban immigrant, Julio Gonzalez, has been charged with setting
the deadly blaze after a dispute with his girlfriend, who worked at
the club as a coat checker.
   The club had been operating in violation of vacate orders issued
after city inspectors discovered there was no second exit, no fire
alarms and inadequate sprinklers.
