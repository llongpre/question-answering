   Nightmares jolt Ruben Valladarez awake in his
hospital bed, tormenting him with thoughts of friends who died in a
place called Happy Land.
   ``I feel better,'' he said Friday. ``Only I got a little bad
dreams.''
   Valladarez, the disc jockey at the illegal Bronx social club, is
one of a few survivors of the arson fire that killed 87 people
March 25. He was critically injured, with burns over 40 percent of
his body.
   In his first interview, Valladarez described the ordeal
haltingly, with tears. He lost friends, and at least three cousins,
he said, naming them with a tortured face. He cannot explain why he
was the one who lived.
   He was spinning records in the back, on the second floor, about
4 a.m. ``Somebody screamed _ `Fire!''' Valladarez recalled. ``I put
the lights on. I said into the microphone, ``Everybody get out!
I've got a fire!''
   There was no emergency exit at the crowded club, no emergency
lights, no sprinkler system, not even a window to jump from.
Valladarez was one of only two people to escape from the second
floor. Four or more escaped from the first floor.
   First he crossed to the front of the second-floor dance area,
looking for a friend. ``I said, `We have to get out, man.''' He
descended a narrow front stairway to the first floor bar. It was
already filled with flames.
   ``Downstairs is fire. I run downstairs,'' said Valladarez, 26, a
native of Trujillo, Honduras, for whom English is a second language.
   People there were running about in panic. ``They scream.
Everybody going to the door, pushing the door. It's locked.''
   Valladarez thought of his wife, Frances, and their 2-year-old
daughter, Nadine. He ran into the flames, searching for the sole
open door; there was no other choice. ``I had to go,'' he said.
   When Valladarez reached the street his clothes were on fire.
People threw water on him. He suffered third-degree burns on his
forearms and hands, second-degree burns on his legs and face.
   When his wife saw him at Bronx Municipal Hospital she could not
recognize him.
   Twelve days and three operations later, Valladarez remains in
critical condition in the burn ward. He may need more surgery, and
two to three months of hospitalization, and nine to 18 months of
rehabilitation. The burn ward chief, Dr. Steven Blau, said it is
too soon to say whether Valladarez will regain the use of his hands.
   ``His attitude is very good. He's a fighter,'' Blau said. ``And
his attitude is very important, because everything he has to do in
terms of recovery will hurt him.''
   Valladarez's face is raw, blistered under the eyebrows and on
his lips, coated with salve. A tube feeds oxygen into his nose. Two
needles provide intravenous fluid. His arms are heavily bandaged,
one suspended from a stand to keep swelling down. He is hooked up
to a heart monitor.
   He said he feels anguish for loved ones who died and anger at
Julio Gonzalez, the man accused of setting the fire to punish an
ex-girlfriend who worked there.
   ``He has to go to jail. Fifty years _ or 200,'' Valladarez said.
``In my country, this man is die.''
   Valladarez, who worked at the Happy Land for two years, said he
never had considered the danger of fire there.
   His advice now: Stay away. ``Don't go no more. Because every
social club in New York is bad.''
