   Atop the rickety wooden staircase, the dance
floor trembled under heels tapping and shuffling to the beat that
shifted from salsa to calypso. Disco lights glittered on silk
clothes, Saturday night's finest.
   Suddenly, flames roaring in the bottom floor turned the top room
into a blast furnace. Within seconds, superheated gases and thick
smoke had silenced the place. Only a handful had escaped.
   The $5 cover was a small price to pay for a night out in the
poor Latino community of East Tremont, near the Bronx Zoo. People
dressed up nice and they partied hard.
   ``The whole floor moved with the music, it was sleazy and very,
very hot,'' said Denise Garcia, 20. ``People liked to go there and
show off.''
   Lately, the patrons say, the mostly Honduran clientele had
expanded to include other Hispanics. Sometimes a gun or a knife
flashed, or someone whipped out a crack vial.
   Three of the victims played amateur soccer for a Bronx team
named after one of the big teams in Honduras, where many of the
youths hoped to return some day.
   ``They all dreamed of returning with more money, they were full
of Hispanic machismo,'' said their coach, Miguel Reyes.
   At about 3:15 a.m. Sunday, there was a ruckus downstairs in the
tiny entryway. A bearded Cuban patron was harassing his former
girlfriend who worked at the club, and a bouncer was called over.
   ``Don't push me, don't push me,'' the patron said, according to
witnesses. And then: ``I'll be back.''
   The man identified as Julio Gonzalez, 36, angered by his
rejection by ex-girlfriend Lydia Feliciano, fetched gasoline from a
service station, according to police.
   Then he stood at the club's exit and splashed the fuel on the
floor and wall inside. Then he struck a match.
   The Happy Land Social Club's name referred to America, regular
patrons said, a place of hope for the young immigrants who
frequented the club.
   When the fire allegedly lighted by Gonzalez took, fire
investigators said, the ground floor became an inferno; the
windowless second floor, where all but 18 of the 87 victims were
found, was a gas chamber, with wall-to-wall bodies.
   The few survivors included Ms. Feliciano; Gonzalez, under
suicide watch at a psychiatric ward, is charged with 87 murders.
   Long after dawn, a stream of corpses left the Happy Land on
stretchers, covered with white sheets.
   Some died instantly. Rescue workers told of finding victims with
glasses in their hands. Others were sitting at the bar, their legs
still wound around bar stools.
   ``Lungs are seared by hot gases, and it becomes impossible to
take a second breath,'' said Dr. Alexander Kuehl, director of
emergency medicine at New York Hospital. ``And when there is not
enough oxygen coming in to feed the fire, you get carbon monoxide,
which can kill you in a minute.''
   ``It was a huge rush of superheated poison gas. We call it a
flashover, it is instant. If you are breathing in, it is deadly,''
said Zachary Goldfarb, Emergency Medical Service deputy chief of
operations.
   Some victims, facing the wall of fire that came from downstairs,
frantically tried to escape. Bodies were piled four deep by the
upstairs door, a testament to their desperation.
   ``You can't imagine what went on in there; you can't imagine
what these people did to try to survive,'' said firefighter Dennis
Devlin.
   ``There was one woman who looked to be holding onto her
boyfriend for dear life,'' said Emergency Medical Services worker
Kerry Naughton, ``There was a man lying over a woman, as if he was
trying to shield her with his body.''
   There was no sprinkler system on the ground floor. The
sprinklers on the second floor discharged after 87 people were
dead, authorities said. Firefighters arrived in a few minutes, but
there were no screams, no cries.
