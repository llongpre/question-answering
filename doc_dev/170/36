<HEADLINE>  AS ARSON TRIAL BEGINS, JUDGE OKS CONFESSIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     All but a handful of patrons were trapped and died when fire raced through
the cramped, two-story Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx borough.;    Julio
Gonzalez, 37, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. He faces 178
counts of murder, including two murder charges for each victim, in the March
25, 1990, fire. The other charges include attempted murder, arson and assault.
He is being tried in trial-level state Supreme Court.;    Richard Berne,
Gonzalez's court appointed defense attorney, said he was not surprised by the
judge's decision, which preceded jury selection. The defense had moved to
suppress the confessions and physical evidence.;    The three statements to
police include one that was videotaped soon after Gonzalez's arrest. On all
three, police say, Gonzalez admitted that he had poured gasoline in the
entrance of the club and set it afire.;    Police say he admitted he set the
fire in anger after he was ejected from the club for harassing a former
girlfriend who worked there. She escaped.;    Most of the victims were
Hondurans who frequented Happy Land, one of many illegal after-hours clubs
then operating in the city.;    Fire and building inspectors had ordered the
club closed in 1988 because it lacked a fire alarm and sprinklers and had just
one exit.  </TEXT>
