   Hondurans jammed phone lines Monday
seeking news of relatives in New York City following a weekend fire
that killed 87 people at a Bronx social club.
   The government expressed regret over the death of the victims,
most of them Hondurans and Dominicans, and instructed its
ambassador to gather information for relatives.
   Gov. Dylia Chirinos de Diaz said most of the Hondurans were from
coastal towns in Colon province.
   ``The majority of them traveled to the United States in search
of a better way of life,'' said Edith Fajardo, a Honduran consular
official in New York.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro said the government
was studying the possibility of sending a Honduran air force plane
to bring back the bodies of the victims of the fire at the Happy
Land social club.
   Julio Cesar Castro of the northwestern city of San Pedro Sula
said his 17-year-old daughter, Janeta Mercedes Castro, died in the
early morning blaze.
   ``My daughter traveled to New York in search of better horizons,
to save money and then return to her home in Honduras, but she only
found death,'' he said.
   She had been in New York for two years and was a maid for an
American family, Castro said. He said she leaves a 2-year-old son
who lives with him.
   A Cuban man thrown out of the club after quarreling with his
ex-girlfriend was arraigned Monday on arson and murder charges.
   Hondurans seeking information on victims and the welfare of
relatives crowded into telephone offices in Colon province.
   Radio stations broadcast almost continual news of the fire and
said they were receiving streams of calls seeking information on
victims. Stations are a major means of communication in the
country, which has a 57 percent illiteracy rate.
   In New York, Miguel Reyes, coach of the Club Deportivo Adrana
amateur soccer team, said three of its players, all from Puerto
Cortes, a northwestern coastal town, were among the dead.
   ``They all dreamed of returning home _ but with more money,''
Reyes said.
   Reynaldo Colon Nunez, a Honduran living in New York, told the
Tegucigalpa station Radio America by telephone that he normally
would have been at the club himself.
   ``Nearly every Sunday I went to Happy Land to dance but
yesterday I didn't want to,'' he said.
