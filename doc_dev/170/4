   Hundreds of dangerous and illegal social clubs
thrive in New York despite efforts to close them, because people in
poor neighborhoods have few alternatives for entertainment,
officials say.
   ``People are literally taking their lives in their hands at
these clubs,'' Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said after a
fire Sunday killed 87 people at the Happy Land social club.
   It was the city's deadliest blaze since 145 people were killed
in a fire at a garment factory, the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. of
Manhattan, 79 years ago to the day.
   Authorities said most of the predawn revelers were trapped on a
second-story dance floor and died from smoke inhalation. The
building lacked proper exits and other safeguards.
   The 4-year-old club, which didn't have a liquor or cabaret
license, was shut down for the second time Nov. 1, 1989, by the
city Buildings Department, but reopened illegally, Mayor David
Dinkins said.
   Despite periodic campaigns to close them, social clubs have been
centers of urban problems ranging from noise and double-parking to
gambling, drug dealing and prostitution.
   Mayor David Dinkins estimated there are at least 700 social
clubs in the city.
   They often are rife with building, health and fire code
violations that can lead to tragedy. Six people died in a 1988 fire
at a Bronx club, five in a Brooklyn club fire in 1985, and 25
people were killed in another Bronx fire in 1976.
   ``I don't know what it's going to take _ an army _ to stop them
from going to places like this,'' said newly elected U.S. Rep. Jose
Serrano after visiting the scene Sunday.
   City records reviewed Sunday showed 173 social clubs had been
given orders to vacate, Dinkins said at an afternoon news
conference.
   ``Tonight, we will commence to check those places, see that
they're in fact closed,'' he said. ``We'll see to it that they
certainly aren't open come the next weekend.''
   Just about anyone can go to a social club, despite the term's
implication of exclusivity. An employee usually keeps an eye on the
door, but a club member is generally anyone who walks in on a given
night.
   ``They range from a group of elderly men who get together to
play cards and watch a ballgame on a Sunday afternoon to
full-fledged nightclub operations,'' said Richard Chernela, a state
Liquor Authority spokesman.
   New York State liquor licenses cost up to $5,100 and are good
for three years. But many club operators don't apply for one,
sometimes because they or potential employees may have criminal
records that would disqualify them.
   While the city's licensed bars are required to close by 4 a.m.,
social clubs often stay open until dawn or later, usually to the
distress of nearby residents. Neighborhood residents said Happy
Land stayed open until 6 a.m.
   Often there's a cover charge _ $5 at Happy Land. Often the clubs
sell drinks.
   Many who go to the clubs are looking for a place to socialize
that they can afford and where they feel welcome. But they also
attract a criminal element.
   A state task force reported several years ago that alcohol
consumption is often of secondary importance.
   ``The primary function of these operations has developed into
prostitution, gambling, drugs and trafficking in stolen property,''
it said.
   Just Sunday morning, a police task force in Brooklyn raided
several social clubs and arrested five people for weapons
possession, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a police spokeswoman.
   Some clubs are closed under the city's ``padlock law,'' which
allows police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are
committed on the site within a 12-month period.
   But the owners _ if they can be found _ are rarely convicted.
Defendants arrested in police raids often end up pleading guilty to
a lesser charge, which then doesn't qualify as a criminal
conviction under the padlock law.
   Even when the clubs are shuttered, the owners often open up
again around the corner or down the street, attracting the same
crowd.
   Then-Mayor Edward Koch put together an interagency task force
after the 1988 fire sparked a public outcry about the dangers of
social clubs.
   ``The ironic thing is that all the legislation is on the
books,'' said Clint Roswell, a spokesman for Ferrer. ``It's just
(an) enforcement problem.''
