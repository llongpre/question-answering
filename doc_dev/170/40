   The city's new commissioner of Hispanic affairs
operates an illegal social club that was ordered closed last year
and again Monday for safety and fire violations, city records show.
   Commissioner William Nieves runs the club, El Caney, in a
building that is supposed to be used as a factory, according to
city Buildings Department documents, the Daily News reported.
   Nieves, appointed to the $65,000-a-year commissioner's post
Friday, denies El Caney is a social club, calling it a ``place for
cultural events,'' but acknowledges knowing about fire and safety
code violations cited last year, the newspaper said in a story
published today.
   An ``order to vacate'' sign was posted on the club door Monday
by a mayoral task force that is cracking down on illegal
establishments in the wake of a fire at an illegal Bronx club
Sunday in which 87 people died.
   Nieves said he planned to give up his job as operator of El
Caney.
   ``It's not a bar or a social club. It's a place for cultural
events. ... When we have parties, they can serve liquor when they
have their own private activities. But you can't call that a bar,''
he said.
   Nieves said he had been under the impression repairs ``were the
responsibility of the landlord, not me.''
   The landlord, R&amp;R Real Estate, was unaware Nieves was operating
a social club there, the newspaper said.
   A summons issued by the Buildings Department last April cited
operation of an illegal gathering place without permits, lack of
emergency lighting, missing exit signs and unilluminated exit
signs. The summons cited a certificate of occupancy that lists the
building's function as a factory.
