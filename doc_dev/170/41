   A stunned neighborhood near the Bronx Zoo tried
to comprehend why many of its sons and daughters perished inside a
social club in the city's third worst fire.
   ``I told my son not to go there. He told me he wasn't going
there,'' said Eledia Alvarez, whose 22-year-old son Danny was one
of the 87 people who died in the fire early Sunday.
   Police cars and fire rescue trucks were still parked Monday near
the Happy Land Social Club, with its incongruous name and yellow
``happy face'' above a fire-blackened entrance and a single barred
window.
   Several hundred people loitering behind the blue police
sawhorses shook their heads or shrugged when asked if they knew
Julio Gonzalez, 36. He is alleged to have poured gasoline in the
doorway of the illegal nightspot and then set it afire, trapping
partyers in an upstairs dance area. Most suffocated before they
could flee down the two narrow stairways.
   Classes were underway as usual at Public School 67, which on
Sunday served as the clearing house for families and friends to
view police photographs of the victims. On Monday, a task force of
seven city, state and private agencies was still using part of the
building to help relatives make funeral arrangements.
   The city offered $900 to survivors who need burial assistance,
and the state Crime Victims Board will pay up to $2,500.
   Mrs. Alvarez was among some 200 relatives and friends who
returned for that purpose. They spoke with disgust about how the
Happy Land was able to operate despite having been ordered by city
authorities to close, and with sorrow that some people continued to
patronize it despite its reputation as an unsafe place.
   Rene J. Mena, 63, said his 30-year-old son, Rene Jr., the oldest
of 10 children and himself the father of three, had invited him to
go out on Saturday night.
   ``I told him I didn't want to go to that place. That is a very
dangerous place, and I'm not going there.''
   Rene Jr. died in the fire.
