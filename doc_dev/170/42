   The bodies of 50 of the 87 people killed in a
fire at an illegal Bronx social club were loaded onto a cargo plane
at Kennedy Airport on Saturday for a late-night flight to Honduras,
a nation in mourning.
   At a brief memorial service in the huge hangar to which the
caskets had come, some in hearses, others stacked on flatbed
trucks, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said New York City would ``do all
possible to make sure this will never happen again.''
   ``These young people came to this great city of ours seeking
hope and opportunity, and now they leave like this,'' Lynch said,
gesturing toward the long row of caskets. ``The bodies lying here
before us say we've got to do more. We've got to do more to make
sure this doesn't happen again.''
   Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas planned to head a
government delegation receiving the bodies when the plane arrived
Sunday morning. After an airport Mass, Honduran air force planes
and helicopters will take the remains to 12 locations in the
country, said Nahum Valladares, Honduran information minister.
   In New York, police continued their crackdown on the hundreds of
unlicensed social clubs, or bars, which dot the city's poorer
neighborhoods.
   Police said they visited 261 locations late Friday and early
Saturday and found only 65 clubs open. They issued 29 orders to
vacate the premises, 57 summonses and 80 violation notices. On
Thursday night, they visited 89 club sites and found 74 closed.
   Most club operators closed down before they were shut down,
according to a neighborhood liquor store owner who has supplied
liquor to social clubs. He spoke to The Associated Press on the
condition of anonymity.
   The retailer said that by Friday afternoon he had not heard from
any of the clubs that normally contact him during the day to place
orders.
   Because they are not licensed, social clubs cannot obtain liquor
from wholesalers and must buy from retailers. Such sales often
violate state rules limiting the amount of liquor any one person
can buy retail at one time.
   Their defenders say the clubs fill a need. Julio Medina, who was
at a Brooklyn club that was raided Thursday night, admitted that
the Bronx fire had worried him. ``But this is all there is,'' he
said. ``People cannot afford anything else.''
   A Bronx grand jury has charged Julio Gonzalez with murder for
allegedly etting the fire that devastated the Happy Land club a
week ago.
   Police say Gonzalez, enraged by a former girlfriend's rejection,
spilled a dollar's worth of gasoline in the entrance to the club
and set it ablaze. Conviction on a murder charge carries a maximum
penalty of 25 years to life.
   Gonzalez is being held in Bellevue Hospital, in isolation and
under 24-hour watch. The former girlfriend, an employee at the
club, was one of the few to escape.
   Six victims were buried Friday at St. Raymond's Cemetery in the
Bronx, and dozens of mourners attended a wake Friday evening for
three others. Other funerals were held Saturday before the airlift
to Honduras.
   The DC-8 scheduled to take the 50 bodies to Honduras was
chartered by the American Red Cross. Ed Hardy, a Red Cross
spokesman, said about 100 relatives of fire victims also were being
flown to Honduras at Red Cross expense on regular commercial
flights.
   Hardy said an exact time for the cargo plane to leave Kennedy
had not been set. The flight takes about five hours, and the plane
was not slated to reach Honduras until after dawn Sunday.
