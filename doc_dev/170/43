   Authorities had warned the owners of the
building that housed the Happy Land Social Club that it was riddled
with violations, including no sprinkler system on the first floor,
where the fire started.
   Notice of the fire code violations, which also included an
illegally added-on second floor, no second exit and no fire alarms,
were sent to Alex DiLorenzo III, the owner, building Commissioner
Charles Smith Jr. told The New York Times in today's editions.
   DiLorenzo leased the building to Jay Weiss, husband of actress
Kathleen Turner, who in turn leased the building to club manager
Elias Colon. Colon was among the 87 people who died in the fire
Sunday.
   Normally, the violations report would have been forwarded by the
owner to the leaseholder, but Weiss' attorneys said they never
received a formal notice of the violations. They would not comment
on whether they knew of them.
   Prosecutors are looking into whether the building's landlords or
owners might bear responsibility for the fire. Police alleged it
was set by Julio Gonzalez, in a jealous rage against his
ex-girlfriend, who worked at the club.
   The club was incorporated in 1988 as a not-for-profit
corporation for ``the purpose of providing for members
entertainment, sport, recreation and amusement of all kinds,'' the
Times reported.
   The incorporation papers appeared to enable Colon to avoid
filing state and city income tax forms, the Times said.
   Weiss had been trying to evict the Happy Land Social Club for
non-payment of rent since September, according to Weiss' lawyer,
Roger Boyle.
   A lease signed by Happy Land on Oct. 7, 1987, called for monthly
rents of $1,500 for the first year, $1,650 for the second and
$1,950 for the third.
   Court papers concerning the rent squabble show that on Feb. 15,
1989, a process server stuck a notice on the door of Happy Land
demanding $3,074 within three days for rent payments allegedly due
since Dec. 1, 1987.
   Weiss' company, One Peach Associates, asked a marshal to obtain
an eviction notice on Sept. 6, 1989, according to the papers. A
judge validated the eviction warrant the next week and then Colon
filed to stop the proceedings, saying he had not seen the court
papers.
   Colon maintained in an affidavit that all his rent had been
paid. A judge granted a stay of the eviction warrant.
   Papers filed on March 12 assert that Colon ``made substantial
improvements to the premises with the approval and consent of the
petitioner.''
   The case was to have been tried today.
   One Peach also leased space to La Salsa, another after-hours
club around the corner from Happy Land, for $2,500 a month, the
Daily News said in today's editions.
   Neighborhood residents said La Salsa has one door and no
windows. Because of fire code violations, it had been ordered
closed on Aug. 28, 1988, the News reported.
   La Salsa was packed with revelers on the night of the fire at
Happy Land.
