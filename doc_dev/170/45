The bodies of 50 of the 87 people killed in a Bronx social club fire were 
loaded onto a cargo plane at Kennedy Airport on Saturday for a late-night 
flight to Honduras, a nation in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
At a brief memorial service in the hangar to which the coffins had come, some 
in hearses, others stacked on flatbed trucks, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said New 
York would "do all possible to make sure this will never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
"These young people came to this great city of ours seeking hope and 
opportunity, and now they leave like this," Lynch said, gesturing toward the 
long row of coffins. "The bodies lying here before us say we've got to do more. 
We've got to do more to make sure this doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, police were continuing their crackdown on the hundreds of 
unlicensed social clubs that dot the city's poorer neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they visited 261 locations late Friday and early Saturday and found 
only 65 clubs open. They issued 29 orders to vacate the premises, 57 summonses 
and 80 violation notices. 
</P>
<P>
Most club operators closed down before they were shut down, according to a 
neighborhood store owner who has supplied liquor to social clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The retailer said that by Friday afternoon he had not heard from any of the 
clubs that normally contact him to place orders. 
</P>
<P>
Because they are not licensed, social clubs cannot obtain liquor from 
wholesalers and must buy from retailers. 
</P>
<P>
A Bronx grand jury has indicted Julio Gonzalez with murder for allegedly 
setting the fire that devastated the Happy Land social club a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The DC-8 scheduled to take the 50 bodies to Honduras was chartered by the 
American Red Cross. A spokesman said about 100 relatives of fire victims were 
being flown to Honduras at Red Cross expense on commercial flights.
