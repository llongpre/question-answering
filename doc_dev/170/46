   Jailed as an army deserter in Cuba, the Mariel
refugee charged with setting the nightclub fire that killed 87
people was described as a street hustler who recently lost his job
and girlfriend.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was moved Monday from the Rikers Island jail
to the psychiatric ward at Kings County Hospital, where he was
under a suicide watch, said Ruby Ryles, a spokeswoman for the city
Corrections Department.
   Gonzalez, charged with murdering 87 people by torching the Happy
Land Social Club early Sunday, had no prior criminal record.
   Gonzalez told immigration officials when he arrived in the
United States in 1980 that he had portrayed himself as a drug
trafficker to Cuban authorities in order to get kicked out of Cuba,
Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, told The New York Times.
   There was no evidence Gonzalez was involved with drugs here,
officials said.
   U.S. officials have complained that many of the 125,000 people
kicked out of Cuba in the boatlift had criminal records or mental
disorders. Others were simply dissatisfied with life in Cuba.
   Gonzalez reportedly lost his last job, at a lamp factory, about
six months ago. Detective James Malvey said Gonzalez since had
hustled money washing cars and peddling.
   For the past three months Gonzalez has lived in an $80-a-week
furnished room in the Bronx. Before that he had lived with
45-year-old Lydia Feliciano.
   ``He was just a normal guy,'' said Ray Davis, the building
manager. ``He's a nice, quiet, clean guy.''
   Gonzalez allegedly told police he torched the club after
quarreling with Ms. Feliciano.
   Franco Mena, who showed up at the club after the fire, said he
and another man prevailed on Ms. Feliciano to identify Gonzalez as
the arsonist. ``She didn't want to talk because she thought nobody
had heard her argument,'' Mena said.
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said Gonzalez's shoes
still reeked of gasoline when he was arrested at his apartment 12
hours after the fire.
   According to immigration records, Gonzalez arrived in the United
States at Key West, Fla., on May 31, 1980, as part of the Mariel
boatlift.
   He was detained at Camp McCoy, Wis., then Fort Chaffee, Ark.,
until Feb. 21, 1981, when he was released, said Verne Jervis of the
immigration service.
   He was sent to live with a sponsor family in New York. The
agency that handled that placement said it was still looking for
Gonzalez' records.
   Gonzalez told federal officials that he was in a Cuban prison
from 1971 to 1974 for desertion. But that account had not been
confirmed, officials said.
   Jervis said Gonzalez had never applied for permanent residence,
which makes him deportable after doing time for a criminal offense.
