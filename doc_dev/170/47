<HEAD>Arson Ruled Out In Social Club Fire</HEAD>

   The death toll in a fire that gutted a basement
social club was revised downward from seven to six, and officials
said the blaze did not appear to be arson as was originally
suspected.
   ``We believe at this point that the fire was accidental, but
many important witnesses who were badly injured have yet to be
interviewed by fire marshals,'' Fire Department spokesman John
Mulligan said Monday.
   Dozens of patrons who were injured in Sunday's fire at the Bronx
club known as The Hole remain hospitalized, many severely burned.
Eighteen firefighters also were hurt, none seriously.
   Arson was initially suspected because of the rapid spread of the
blaze at the club, which officials said operated illegally because
it served liquor without a license and didn't have enough exits to
comply with building codes.
   Many social clubs here operate like bottle clubs in other
states, where customers bring their own liquor and get mixers from
the management.
   Fire and police officials were unable Monday to explain why
seven dead were counted Sunday instead of the correct six, said
police spokesman Peter O'Donnell.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said Monday that he wanted the city to do
more to close illegal social clubs.
   ``What can we do to locate all of these illegal premises and
close them down?'' Koch said in a memo to the police commissioner,
fire commissioner and buildings commissioner.
   The Hole has been raided five times since March by the Police
Department, and there have been nine arrests, said Koch spokesman
Tom Kelly.
   The club did not have a liquor license, Kelly said.
   Koch described the club, a 50-by-75-foot T-shaped space, as a
``rabbit warren.''
   The steep, narrow staircase leading down to the club was ``no
better than a ladder,'' said Mulligan.
