   The owner of an illegal basement nightclub where
six people died in a fire was arrested at a pay phone after police
traced a call he made to a detective to assert his innocence,
authorities said Friday.
   Domingo Reyes, 37, was charged Thursday with six counts of
manslaughter and 10 of reckless endangerment in the blaze at the
Bronx club known as The Hole, said Deputy Chief Daniel Ryan.
   The Fire Department said the blaze Sunday appeared to be
accidental, but Reyes was held responsible because the club was
illegally operated, authorities said.
   The club served liquor without a license and did not have enough
exits, officials said.
   Six patrons were killed and 33 others injured. The reckless
endangerment counts relate to the 10 most seriously injured, Ryan
said.
   Reyes was arrested after he called police, ran out of change and
gave the number to a detective who promised to call back, said
Ryan. The detective kept him on the line for 35 minutes while
police used the number to locate the phone.
   ``Reyes was explaining (to the detective) he didn't think he'd
done anything wrong,'' said Ryan. ``Basically, he was protesting
his innocence.''
   Police are also looking for Reyes' partner in the club, but Ryan
said he is believed to be out of the country.
   Police had raided The Hole five times since March and made nine
arrests, said mayoral spokesman Tom Kelly. The steep, narrow
staircase leading down to the club was ``no better than a ladder,''
said Fire Department spokesman John Mulligan.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who said Monday he wanted the city to do
more to close illegal social clubs, described the club, a
50-by-75-foot T-shaped space, as a ``rabbit warren.''
