   Hundreds of mourners, many weeping, others
calling for revenge, offered their prayers at a funeral home
Wednesday for 17 victims of the city's deadliest fire in 79 years.
   Officials, meanwhile, began preparations for a grim airlift of
the dead to their Honduran homeland. The Red Cross has asked the
New York National Guard to help transport the bodies, an aide to
Gov. Mario Cuomo said.
   A funeral Mass Wednesday evening at St. Joseph's Catholic Church
drew 1,500 people, while 1,000 others who could not get in stood
outside the church during the service.
   Earlier, outside the Bronx funeral home across the street from
St. Joseph's, the street was crowded with people waiting to pay
their respects to the victims. The dead were among 87 people killed
early Sunday inside the Happy Land social club in the Bronx, just
10 blocks away.
   Three women fainted outside the funeral home, collapsing in
front of the crowd waiting to enter. At least 15 others needed
medical assistance.
   Jose Alvarez, mourning his brother Denny, 22, left the Rivera
Funeral Home sobbing and clinging to his cousin and a friend.
   Across the street on the steps of the church, Denny's father
tearfully vented his rage at Julio Gonzalez, 36, the man accused of
setting the fatal fire in a quarrel with an ex-girlfriend.
   ``They ought to take him and give him a public hanging,'' Pedro
Alvarez said. ``People like that don't deserve to live.''
   Two women emerged from the home screaming the names of dead
relatives. Others expressed disbelief their friends were gone.
   ``He doesn't look like him. He looks too old,'' said Katy
Carval, 17, after seeing former classmate Israel Bulnes, 18, who
died with his girlfriend.
   Earlier in the day, family members of the victims met with
American Red Cross officials at a public school near the burned-out
red brick building to receive the belongings each victim carried or
wore when the fire struck.
   Outside the school, Carlos Pena clutched a manila envelope that
held a watch, a set of keys, and some cash _ things his brother
Eli, 26, had with him early Sunday at the doomed Happy Land club.
   The watch came with Eli from Honduras, and Carlos said the
timepiece would now be his. ``It means a lot, a reminder,'' he said.
   Also Wednesday, a civil court hearing did not determine whether
the club operator's widow should replace her husband, Elias Colon,
in an eviction lawsuit brought by the landlord, One Peach
Associates.
   Jay Weiss, husband of actress Kathleen Turner, is part owner of
One Peach, which held a 49-year lease on the building from one of
New York's biggest landlords, Alex DiLorenzo III.
   The court hearing did not address responsibility for the fire or
whether the landlords were aware of a city effort to close the club
because it was illegal and unsafe.
   While wakes were held Wednesday, funeral arrangements still were
being made.
   The Honduran government said it expected the bodies of 75 fire
victims to begin arriving late this week at San Pedro Sula in
northwestern Honduras.
   More than one-third of the Hondurans were from Puerto Cortes, a
Caribbean port 135 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa, said Information
Minister Nahum Valladares.
   The Honduran government declared three days of national mourning
Wednesday, and said 78 victims had been identified as Honduran.
   The government was negotiating with Eastern Airlines to take the
bodies from New York to Miami, where they would be transferred to
the Honduran airline Tan-Sahsa, said the minister.
   The airline was working with the Red Cross to provide special
fares for relatives wishing to attend the funerals in Honduras,
said spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak. Tan-Sahsa and the Costa Rican
carrier Lacsa also offered to help, said Red Cross spokesman Larry
Mackler.
   In Washington, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., called on the
Air Force to donate use of a transport plane to return fire victims
for burial in their homelands of Honduras and the Dominican
Republic.
   ``Providing an Air Force plane would be a humanitarian gesture
to the families of the victims,'' she said in a letter to Air Force
Secretary Donald Rice. ``Moreover, it would help express America's
sorrow for the tragedy and our affection for our neighbors in the
hemisphere.''
   An Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes, said Rice has
the matter ``under consideration.''
