   The man accused of setting fire to the Happy
Land social club was arraigned Monday on charges of murdering 87
people, and police said he told them ``the devil got into me.''
   Authorities began shutting other illegal clubs in response to
New York City's worst fire in 79 years.
   The families of the 87 victims, most of whom were Honduran or
Dominican immigrants, sought solace in their grief, and a
government task force was set up to counsel them and help make
funeral arrangements.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was accused of setting the fire early Sunday
with $1 worth of gasoline after arguing with a former girlfriend
who worked at the illegal club. He is said to have threatened to
``shut this place down.''
   ``I got angry, the devil got into me, and I set the place on
fire,'' Gonzalez told authorities, according to a police source who
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   During a hearing at Bronx County Criminal Court, Gonzalez was
charged with 87 counts of murder committed during the course of
arson; 87 counts of murder by depraved indifference to human life;
one count of attempted murder; and two counts of arson.
   The case was turned over to a grand jury, and Gonzalez will not
be asked to enter a plea unless an indictment is issued. He was
held under a suicide watch at the Rikers Island jail and later
admitted to Kings County Hospital Psychiatric Ward, where he will
be held indefinitely, said Ruby Ryles, a city jails spokeswoman.
   The deaths were believed to be the most ever charged to a single
suspect in the continental United States.
   ``He is a double animal,'' said Rene J. Mena, 63, whose son,
Rene Jr., 30, died. ``Here, they're going to have good food for
him, a book, a movie. In Central America, we don't do it that way.''
   District Attorney Robert T. Johnson said he hoped that if
Gonzalez is convicted, he would get consecutive prison sentences
amounting to 2,000 years.
   An equally angry Mayor David Dinkins ordered a sweep of other
suspected unlicensed social clubs. Police and a special task force
visited 241 clubs citywide from midnight to 7 a.m. Monday and
posted vacate orders on 187.
   Only 23 of the clubs were open _ most are closed on Sunday
nights. There were 52 safety violations and 30 summonses issued,
said Sgt. Dick Vreeland, a police spokesman.
   In the East Tremont section of the Bronx, families drifted in
and out of Public School 67, across from the fire-blackened club. A
task force of state, city and private agencies there helped them
make funeral arrangements and offered counseling and financial
assistance.
   ``It's orderly, but it's not emotionally orderly,'' said Ken
Curtin, a local Red Cross disaster relief director. ``It's highly
charged. There are a lot of outbursts of grief.''
   In Honduras, a foreign ministry spokesman said the government
``is deeply moved by the deaths of many countrymen in New York.''
The Honduran telephone company said it was swamped with calls from
people seeking word about loved ones.
   The fire broke out at 3:40 a.m. Sunday, and those inside the
club suffocated, burned or were trampled to death in a matter of
minutes.
   They had to ``choose between a wall of fire or retreating and
dying of asphyxiation,'' Johnson said.
   Police believe five people escaped from the fire: three patrons;
Gonzalez's former girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano; and the club disc
jockey.
   The disc jockey, identified in published reports as Ruben
Valladares, was listed as stable at Jacobi Hospital with burns over
30 percent of his body, said hospital spokeswoman Vicki Ciampa.
   Ms. Feliciano and the others, whose names were withheld, escaped
serious injury. Ms. Feliciano is in protective custody.
   Johnson said Gonzalez had been ejected from the club after
arguing with Ms. Feliciano and threatening to ``shut this place
down.''
   He allegedly bought $1 worth of gasoline at a nearby service
station, then returned and faked making a telephone call when he
saw a possible witness. When that person left, he allegedly poured
gasoline between the street and an inside door of the club and
ignited it.
   After that, Johnson said, he watched it burn for a while, making
statements to at least two witnesses about his role in the fire. He
then went home, where police found him a few hours later. He made a
videotaped admission to police, authorities said.
   Johnson said Gonzalez knew the two-story club lacked windows,
rear exits and adequate staircases. He also knew how crowded it
was, authorities said.
   Gonzalez, who came to the United States from Cuba on the 1980
Mariel boatlift, had no arrest record here, Johnson said.
   Johnson said he has the name of a possible club owner, but will
not release it until it's confirmed. A vacate order was issued in
November 1988 and again a year later because Happy Land lacked a
proper sprinkler system, exits, emergency lighting and signs. It
also had no liquor or cabaret license, the mayor said.
   The fire struck on the 79th anniversary of the Triangle
Shirtwaist Co. fire. That 1911 tragedy claimed 146 lives, many of
them immigrant garment workers, leading to nationwide reforms in
workplace safety.
   Dinkins discussed night club tragedy while addressing 700
garment workers and other union members who gathered Monday in
Lower Manhattan to commemorate the Triangle fire.
   ``They came to America in search of a better life. Early
yesterday morning their American dream became a fatal nightmare,''
said Dinkins, who inspected the scene of Sunday's fire.
   ``The sight of those bodies, lined along the walls like so many
wax figures, and the realization of the panic and the pain they
must have suffered in their last moments, will remain with me for
the rest of my life,'' said Dinkins. ``Most horrifying is that this
should never have happened.''
   Roman Catholic Cardinal John J. O'Connor officiated at an
hour-long, English and Spanish prayer service outside the club on
Monday afternoon. A thousand mourners began the service by walking
a few blocks from St. Thomas Aquinas church, the parish of many of
the victims.
   ``We pray for those who died,'' said O'Connor. ``We pray in a
special way for those who survived. We need to pray for the dead
and for the survivors. ... Our best is never good enough in
circumstances of this sort.''
