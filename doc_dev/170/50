<LEADPARA>  Criminal charges of code violations were filed against the owner and
leaseholder of the building that housed the Happy Land Social Club, where an
arson fire killed 87 people last March, New York City authorities announced
Friday. Corporation Counsel Victor Kovner, the city's chief lawyer, said
charges were levied against Alex DiLorenzo III, owner of the South Bronx
building, and Jay Weiss, who leased the space and rented it to the club. Weiss
is married to actress Kathleen Turner. Kovner said the club was being operated
in violation of a 1988 order to vacate; that it had no assembly permit;
inadequate lighting; an inadequate sprinkler system; and that it was being
used illegally as a social club with inadequate and dangerous stairs and
exits. Three of the charges carry a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment
and two carry maximum penalties of 90 days. Each charge also carries a fine of
up to $5,000.  </LEADPARA>
