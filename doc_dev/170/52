   A fire that swept through a packed social club
in the Bronx borough early Sunday killed at least 87 people, fire
officials said.
   The fire was reported at 3:41 a.m. in the one-story Happyland
Social Club in the East Tremont section near the Bronx zoo, fire
department spokesman Lee Rodriguez said.
   At least 100 people were caught in the 20-by-50 foot building
when the fire broke out, according to local radio reports. Many of
the deaths apparently were due to smoke inhalation.
   Assistant Fire Commissioner Robert Ungar said at least 87 bodies
were found inside the heavily damaged club.
   More than 30 firefighters were fighting the blaze and removing
survivors, Rodriguez said.
   An official of the Emergency Medical Services said some patients
were taken to hospitals in Manhattan and the Bronx.
   A neighbor, Lilian Rivera, said the club was frequented by
Dominican immigrants who live in the neighborhood. She said it was
a ``family club'' during the day.
