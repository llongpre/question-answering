   The man charged with killing 87 people in one of
the nation's deadliest fires was a Cuban army deserter who arrived
during the 1980 Mariel boatlift and had no arrest record in New
York, authorities said Monday.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was reported to have been nonchalant when he
was arrested at his home Sunday, but later cried and blamed his
actions on the devil, police said.
   ``I got angry, the devil got into me, and I set the place on
fire,'' Gonzalez told authorities, according to a police source who
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   Gonzalez, described by police as a street person who ``hustled''
money washing cars or peddling, was arraigned Monday on charges of
murdering 87 people by setting fire to the Happy Land social club
early Sunday.
   Police said Gonzalez set the fire after getting into an argument
with his 45-year-old former girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano, who worked
at the club.
   He was moved Monday from the prison at Rikers island, where he
had been under a suicide watch, to maximum security protective
custody at the Brooklyn House of Detention, said prisons
spokeswoman Ruby Ryles.
   From there he was taken to Kings County Hospital for a
psychiatric evaluation. He was being held in a prison ward of the
hospital, Ryles said.
   District Attorney Robert Johnson said Gonzalez has no arrest
record in New York. He offered little other information about his
background, saying he didn't know how Gonzalez made a living or
what he has done since entering the country 10 years ago.
   ``His background is not a priority,'' Johnson said.
   Gonzalez reportedly had a job in a lamp factory in the Long
Island City section of Queens, but is believed to have been out of
work for about six months.
   According to immigration records, he arrived in the United
States at Key West, Fla., on May 31, 1980, as part of the Mariel
boatlift. About 125,000 Cubans entered the United States during
that flotilla, including many convicted criminals and other
undesirables.
   Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said Gonzalez had served ``some time'' in prison in Cuba
for deserting from the army.
   However, he said, ``In our interviews we uncovered nothing to
indicate he was criminal in nature.''
   Gonzalez, however, said at the time of his arrival that he had
told Cuban authorities he had trafficked in drugs in order to
qualify for the boatlift, Duke Austin, an INS spokesman, told The
New York Times.
   After arriving in the United States, Gonzalez was detained at
Camp McCoy, Wis., then Ft. Chaffee, Ark., until Feb. 21, 1981, when
he was granted parole status, according to Jervis.
   From Arkansas, he was sent to live with a sponsor family in New
York. ``We've had no contact from him since,'' Jervis said.
   He said Gonzalez has never applied for permanent residence,
which makes him deportable after serving time for a criminal
conviction.
   For the past three months, Gonzalez has lived in an $80-a-week
furnished room on the third floor of a house in the University
Heights section of the Bronx, near the Bronx Zoo. Before that he
had lived with the girlfriend who was employed at the Happy Land,
according to police.
   His neighbors described him as quiet, tidy and polite.
   ``He was just a normal guy. This is totally unexpected,'' Ray
Davis, the building manager, said. ``He's a nice, quiet, clean
guy.''
   ``He didn't seem to have many friends. Not many people came to
visit him. He never caused any problems or arguments,'' said Celia
Lopez, a neighbor.
   ``I still can't believe it _ to have somebody with such a
demented mind living next to me,'' said another neighbor, Yvonne
Torres.
   ``There was nothing out of the ordinary about him. We used to
shoot the breeze and drink beer,'' said Louis Rolan, another
third-floor resident.
