   The man accused of killing 87 people by setting
an illegal social club ablaze in a spurned lover's rage was
indicted on 174 counts of murder.
   A state grand jury Friday indicted Julio Gonzalez, 36, on one
count of second-degree murder and one count of murder in the
commission of a felony for each person killed inside the Happy Land
Social Club on Sunday.
   He also was indicted on two counts of arson and single counts of
attempted murder and assault.
   Gonzalez was not present when the indictment was returned. He is
being held under a 24-hour watch at Bellevue Hospital, where no
other prisoners are permitted within 20 feet of him. He is due back
in court April 12.
   The Red Cross was preparing a charter flight to carry more than
40 bodies back to Honduras today. Six victims were buried Friday.
   Gonzalez's court-appointed defense attorney, Richard W. Berne,
told reporters at state Supreme Court in the New York City borough
of the Bronx he would consider an insanity defense.
   That angered Violet Sambula, a friend of victim Gladys Gomez, 26.
   ``He's going to try to get away with it. It's just not fair,''
Sambula said at a wake for three victims Friday night.
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said Gonzalez conceivably
could be convicted of two murder counts for each victim, but he
said a jury ``probably would have to choose between the two.''
   Gonzalez' sentence could face 25 years to life in prison if
convicted on all counts and if the sentences run concurrently,
Assistant District Attorney Eric Warner said. If a judge made the
sentences run consecutively, he could receive a 2,000-year term.
   ``No case is open and shut,'' Warner said. ``We have a very good
case. The evidence is strong.''
   While the grand jury considered the charges, authorities
released records indicating the social club's landlord was
contacted by a fire lieutenant about eight months ago and told a
vacate order was in effect against the building.
   Morris Jaffe, a partner in Little Peach Realty Corp., responded
that the problem ``would be taken care of,'' according to a July
28, 1989, Fire Department document. Jaffe and Jay Weiss, husband of
actress Kathleen Turner, are partners in the realty company.
   Jaffe was not in his office Friday morning to comment on the
report.
   Also on Friday, two more multimillion-dollar negligence lawsuits
were brought by families of fire victims against the social club;
Alex DiLorenzo, identified as the building's owner; Little Peach;
Weiss and Jaffe, and the City of New York.
   One lawsuit is seeking $100 million, the other $57 million.
   In addition to negligence, the lawsuits, filed in Manhattan's
federal court, charge the city with ``an official policy of
deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights'' of the
deceased.
