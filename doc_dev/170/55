   The husband of actress Kathleen Turner is one of
the landlords of the illegal social club where arson killed 87
people, his lawyer said today.
   Roger Boyle said in a statement that Jay Weiss and a partner,
Morris Jaffe, principals of Little Peach Realty Inc., leased the
Bronx site in 1985 from Clarendon Place, a corporation controlled
by Alex DiLorenzo III.
   Little Peach sublet the property in 1987 to Elias Colon, who
operated the Happy Land social club and was one of the 87 who died
there early Sunday.
   Boyle added that Little Peach had been trying to evict Colon and
an eviction trial was scheduled for Wednesday.
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson has said his staff was
working on sorting out the ownership of the building and looking
into whether anyone in the corporate chain bears criminal liability
in the deaths.
   Miss Turner and Weiss married in August 1984 after a romance
that started when he helped her find a Manhattan apartment.
   MIss Turner, who starred in movies such as ``Body Heat,''
``Romancing The Stone,'' and ``War of the Roses,'' is starring on
Broadway in a revival of ``Cat On a Hot Tin Roof.''
