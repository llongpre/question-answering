<LEADPARA>  A jury in New York City convicted a Cuban immigrant of murder Monday for
setting a fire that killed 87 people at the illegal Happy Land social club.
Julio Gonzalez, 37, started the blaze on March 25, 1990, by igniting a
dollar's worth of gasoline at the club's only exit after a fight with a former
girlfriend. She worked at the club as a coat checker and was one of six
survivors. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 19. Gonzalez faces a maximum of
25 years to life in prison.  </LEADPARA>
