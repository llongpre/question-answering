   A judge rejected a motion Wednesday to dismiss
murder charges against a man accused of torching an illegal social
club and killing 87 revelers.
   Defense attorney Richard W. Berne had asked for the dismissal on
grounds that he had not had access to a videotaped statement taken
from Julio Gonzalez by police before a grand jury indicted him.
Gonzalez has pleaded innocent to 174 counts of murder.
   State Supreme Court Judge Burton R. Roberts rejected Berne's
motion and set May 30 for Gonzalez' next court appearance, when it
was expected that a psychiatric report would be available.
   Gonzalez, 36, has been held in a prison ward at a psychiatric
hospital since his arrest in the pre-dawn fire that killed 87
people at the Happy Land social club March 25.
   He faces charges of murder by arson and murder by depraved
indifference for each of the victims, plus two counts of arson and
one count each of assault and attempted murder.
   Police say Gonzalez, a Cuban immigrant, admitted setting the
fire after an argument with a former girlfriend who worked at the
club. She was one of five people known to have escaped the fire.
Most of the victims were Honduran immigrants.
   Meanwhile, a group of Hondurans said they would appeal to
Roberts to reconsider his position that Gonzalez, a Cuban
immigrant, could draw only one maximum 25-year-to-life sentence
even if convicted on all counts. That could make him eligible for
parole in 25 years.
   Roberts has said New York law provides for concurrent rather
than consecutive sentences in cases where multiple deaths result
from one criminal act.
   ``We feel that this is too narrow an interpretation of the
law,'' Jose Velasquez, a civil engineer, said outside the courtroom
after Wednesday's hearing.
   Velasquez said a petition drive among an estimated 50,000
Hondurans living in the city would be conducted by a newly formed
group calling itself the Federation of Honduran Organizations in
New York.
