   Rosa Perez and Carlos Peri were building a life
together. He was working construction. They had a nice apartment, a
new baby and a dream of going back to their native Honduras to
live.
   In a few frantic moments, the Happy Land fire changed all that.
Carlos was killed along with 86 other people when a revenge-seeking
arsonist torched the illegal Bronx social club early one Sunday
morning last March.
   Now Rosa's life is lawyers and lawsuits and waiting. And being a
single parent to her son, now 10 months old.
   ``I'm really at a loss without Carlos,'' says Rosa as she
lovingly strokes the boy's head. ``I had to move out of the
apartment we had because I couldn't afford to stay there anymore.''
   ``Sometimes I don't have enough money to buy milk for the
baby,'' the 23-year-old mother says sadly in Spanish. ``When the
baby's father was here and alive, life was not hard, because he was
very good.
   ``But now, it is very hard.''
   Rosa is a plaintiff in one of 93 lawsuits prompted by the March
25 fire. Thirty-seven lawyers represent victims' relatives and five
survivors of the blaze.
   The building's owner, real estate tycoon Alex DiLorenzo III,
faces dozens of suits alleging that he kept the building in
substandard condition and therefore should be financially liable.
   DiLorenzo, in turn, claims that the lease holders, Jay Weiss and
Morris Jaffe, didn't take steps to improve the building as was
their responsibility.
   The city had ordered DiLorenzo to close the building in November
1988. The city issued code violations for operating a social club
without a permit, failing to provide a least two exits on the first
and second floor, and having no emergency lighting, no fire alarms
and no sprinkler system.
   Despite the many violations, the club continued to operate.
   Today, the building is vacant, a burned-out shell that draws the
curious. Occasionally, flowers are placed on the sidewalk in memory
of the victims.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, is charged with setting the blaze with a
dollar's worth of gasoline after a fight with his former girlfriend
who worked at the club. Most of the victims were trapped on the
second floor.
   Gonzalez was indicted on multiple counts of murder and arson and
is undergoing defense-requested psychiatric evaluation while
awaiting trial.
   One of the plaintiffs' attorneys, Norman Liss, says lawsuits
like Rosa's should be settled quickly.
   ``We feel that this is a case that cries out for justice,'' Liss
says. ``This is a very needy population. We don't want to be
talking about resolution of this case six, seven, 10 years down the
road.''
   Peter Cross, an attorney for DiLorenzo and DiLorenzo's company,
Clarendon Place Corp., agrees that all sides ``are hopeful that
this can be settled without prolonged litigation,'' possibly within
a year.
   Two factors may hinder a speedy resolution: DiLorenzo's personal
finances - it has been reported that he faces numerous foreclosures
and may not be able to pay his debts - and public squabbling
between DiLorenzo and Weiss, the husband of actress Kathleen
Turner.
   DiLorenzo said he never saw the violations issued by the city;
Weiss, whose corporation leased the Happy Land building from
DiLorenzo and then re-rented it to the club's operator, said
DiLorenzo ``ran his buildings into the ground.''
   While some attorneys debate responsibilities, others document
how relatives and loved ones depended on money sent by the victims.
   Carlos Peri worked as a carpenter, mostly in construction,
earning up to $250 a week, according to Susan Karten, Rosa's
attorney.
   He not only supported Rosa and their baby here, he also sent his
father in Honduras $50 a month and sent his sister $100 whenever he
could so she could attend school, she says. In poverty-stricken
Honduras, even those relatively small amounts can go a long way.
   Under New York law, the only person who can receive any money
from a settlement would be the baby, also named Carlos. But under
victim compensation laws, if relatives and loved ones can prove
support, they can file claims, Karten says. Rosa could qualify for
up to $30,000.
   Rosa seems nonplussed by all the lawyer talk.
   She now lives with her mother and sister in the Bronx, where she
says she and the baby both sleep on a sofa. She receives welfare
support for the child totalling about $140 a month.
   Her eyes grow vacant as she talks about Happy Land.
   She remembers she didn't like the club when she had gone there
with Carlos. In fact, she and Carlos had quarreled the night of the
fire. He wanted to go. She didn't.
   ``I told him, `You know I don't like to go there because the men
there just grab you and don't even ask you to dance.'
   ``Then he got angry and reprimanded me and said he wouldn't come
back. But before he left, he played with the baby and he put the
baby in the crib because the baby had fallen asleep in his arms.
   ``And then he said, `Now, I'm leaving. We'll see each other
later.' But I never saw him again.''
