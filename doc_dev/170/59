<HEAD>Newspaper: Gonzalez Says Humiliation, Not Jealousy, Prompted Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Julio Gonzalez, charged with torching an illegal
social club and killing 87 revelers, says he wasn't jealous of a
former girlfriend but humiliated by a bouncer who had earlier
kicked him out, a newspaper reported today.
   Gonzalez spoke from the psychiatric unit at Bellevue Hospital to
New York Newsday. A friend of the Cuban emigre's was present, the
newspaper said.
   Gonzalez, who does not speak English, was quoted by the
newspaper as saying he was not angry over rejection by Lydia
Feliciano, his former girlfriend, but was humiliated by the bouncer
who kicked him out of the Happy Land Social Club at Feliciano's
request.
   Gonzalez said he didn't threaten Feliciano, the newspaper said.
Police have said he told his former girlfriend that night, ``You
won't be here tomorrow.''
   ``I never said that,'' Gonzalez told Newsday. ``I told her, `You
have a lot of boyfriends now,' and she ordered them to throw me
out.''
   The March 25 fire at the Bronx club left 87 patrons dead.
   Gonzalez allegedly started the blaze with a dollar's worth of
gasoline. He has pleaded innocent to 174 counts of murder, two
counts of arson and other charges.
