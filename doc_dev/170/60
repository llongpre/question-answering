   Fire gutted a packed Bronx social club Sunday
afternoon, killing seven people and injuring more than 30, and
firefighters' efforts were hampered by screaming people trying to
get to relatives, authorities said.
   ``It was sheer panic,'' said firefighter Dennis Fennell. The
inside of the basement club was burned out and ``it looked like
people tried to claw out all of the walls,'' he said.
   Fire marshals were testing for the presence of flammable
liquids, said John Mulligan, a spokesman for the Fire Department.
The origin was considered suspicious because of the fire spread so
quickly, he said.
   The streets were filled with screaming people who tried to pull
equipment from firefighters and get to their friends, Fennell said.
   ``There were people running around crazy ...,'' said firefighter
Joseph Kisonas. ``When we went to go do our job, people were trying
to fight the tools away from us. It was crazy. They wanted to pull
us one way and then another way trying to get us to the people
trapped in the basement.''
   Firefighters said five bodies were found in the club, some still
in chairs. Another person died shortly after the fire at a hospital
and the seventh died about eight hours later at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, a spokeswoman said.
   Most of the injured, including six firefighters and two
Emergency Service technicians, were suffering from smoke inhalation
and were taken to hospitals.
   Mulligan described the club as about 50 feet by 75 feet with
7-foot ceilings. Between 60 and 100 people were packed inside.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who toured the blaze aftermath, described
the club as a ``rabbit warren.''
   ``If people were running for their lives, they'd run down blind
alleys and be trapped,'' said Koch, who described the space as
confined and made up of small, partitioned cubicles.
   ``It's clear that it should have never been opened in the first
place,'' he said of the club.
   Philip J. Burns, a deputy fire chief, said the private bar known
to neighbors as ``the hole'' was illegal because bars in basements
are prohibited and the exits were inadequate.
   A resident of the area, Paul Govia, 25, said the club operated
24 hours a day. ``Police often raided the place,'' he said.
Authorities said they have trouble keeping illegal clubs closed
because there are hundreds in the city.
   The fire was reported about 12:30 p.m. and firefighters were
``met by hysterical civilians streaming up the staircase,''
Mulligan said.
   ``One firefighter told me he literally had to fight his way down
the stairs,'' Mulligan said.
   Most escaped through the club's front door and narrow staircase,
but others were able to break through a wall near the back. A
second door on the side of the club was locked, Mulligan said.
   Eighteen engine companies, nine ladder units and about 150
firefighters brought the five-alarm blaze under control about 3:15
p.m., Mulligan said.
