   President Rafael Leonardo Callejas
will head a government delegation receiving the bodies of Hondurans
killed in a New York City social club fire, the government said
Saturday.
   The bodies of 50 of the 87 people killed in the fire were loaded
onto a cargo plane in New York on Saturday for the midnight flight
to Honduras.
   The government said the bodies were to arrive Sunday morning in
San Pedro Sula, 120 miles north of Tegucigalpa. It has said 79 of
the people who died in last Sunday's fire at the Happy Land social
club were Hondurans.
   On Friday, Julio Gonzalez was indicted by a New York state grand
jury on 178 counts of murder, arson and other charges connected
with fire.
   Gonzalez, a 36-year-old Cuban immigrant, spilled gasoline in the
entrance of the illegal club and torched it after being rejected by
a girlfriend employed there, authorities said.
   Nahum Valladares, Honduran information minister, said in a
telephone interview that the bodies returned to Honduras will be
transported on a DC-8.
   The plane was chartered by the American Red Cross. Ed Hardy, a
Red Cross spokesman, said about 100 relatives of fire victims also
were flown to Honduras at Red Cross expense on regular commercial
flights.
   None was aboard the cargo plane, and none attended a memorial
service at the airport in New York.
   The Honduran official said New York officials had also helped
arrange the special flight.
   ``The government this week has held intense conversations with
New York officials, who offered their facilities to repatriate the
dead and their families,'' Valladares said.
   Monsignor Jaime Brufau, the Roman Catholic archbishop of San
Pedro Sula, will officiate a Mass at the airport, and Callejas and
his Cabinet will attend, officials said.
   Valladares said Honduran air force planes and helicopters will
take the remains to 12 locations in Honduras.
   He said the bodies of some other victims would be brought back
to Honduras through private arrangements by their families. Six
victims were been buried in New York.
