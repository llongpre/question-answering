   A suspicious fire at a crowded social club
killed seven and injured more than 30 as panicked patrons clawed
against the walls and doors trying to flee, leaving those who
escaped ``one step from death.''
   Between 60 and 100 people were in the Bronx club known as El
Hoyo (The Hole) when the blaze ignited shortly after noon Sunday,
said John Mulligan, a fire department spokesman.
   Five bodies were found inside the gutted club and two people
died later, authorities said.
   Screaming patrons in the basement club fought for the lone exit,
up a stairway where the fire apparently started, authorities said.
Some broke through a rear wall and were pulled to safety by
firefighters.
   Some who escaped joined bystanders in rushing back in to try to
save others, getting in the way of firefighters and even grabbing
their tools, firefighters said.
   ``It was sheer panic,'' said firefighter Dennis Fennell. ``It
looked like people tried to claw out all of the walls.''
   ``We had to break a door to get to the first floor. ... Then we
had to break in the gate and some people helped from outside to
open the gate,'' said Luis Done, one of those who escaped.
   ``I was one step from death. I feel very lucky.''
   ``All of a sudden I saw the flames come from the bar area. There
was a lot of flames. It was very fast. All of a sudden, whoosh,''
said another patron, Francisco Delarosa, 32.
   Investigators were testing material from the basement for the
presence of flammable liquid, according to Mulligan, who said the
fire was suspicious because it spread rapidly.
   Up to 150 firefighters battled nearly three hours to bring the
fire under control.
   ``There was so much fire blowing out into the street that water
didn't have any effect on it in the initial stages,'' said fire
Capt. James Gallagher.
   The club was in a low-ceiling, 50-by-75-foot basement of a row
of stores and divided into smaller rooms.
   The bodies of four men and one woman were found toward the front
of the club, Gallagher said.
   He said one ``poor guy was found with his face in the wall like
he was trying to crawl into a corner.''
   There was no evidence of a posted license at the club, Mulligan
said. Taverns are prohibited in basements and there weren't enough
exits to satisfy building codes, said Deputy Fire Chief Philip J.
Burns.
   Firefighters were ``met by hysterical civilians streaming up the
staircase,'' Mulligan said. ``One firefighter told me he literally
had to fight his way down the stairs.''
   Most escaped through the club's small front door and narrow
staircase, but others were able to break through a wall near the
back, he said. A second door on the side of the club was locked
shut, he said.
   Firefighter Joseph Kisonas said hysterical people outside the
club ``were trying to fight the tools away from us'' so they could
re-enter and help others.
   Three patrons broke through a rear wall ``and our guys pulled
them out of the rubble and gypsum board,'' Mulligan said.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who toured the scene, described the club
as a ``rabbit warren.''
   ``It's clear that it should have never been opened in the first
place,'' he said of the club.
   Most of the injured, including six firefighters and two
Emergency Medical Service technicians, suffered smoke inhalation
and were taken to hospitals, Mulligan said.
   Sunday's fire was reminiscent of an Oct. 24, 1976, arson fire at
a Bronx social club that killed 25 and injured more than 30. Three
men, including one who quarreled with a woman at the club, were
convicted of setting the fire on the club's only staircase.
