<LEADPARA>  Foil paper is taped over the shop's windows on a Queens side street. There is
no business sign, but the clatter of sewing machines filters through the
closed door.;    Inside, five Asian women piece together flower-print dresses.
Down in the cellar, a teen-age Hispanic girl irons the outfits and adds
finishing touches. Piles of material are shoved back by the furnace. The
ceiling is a tangle of electrical cords and light bulbs. Steam from the iron
adds to the heat.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Four inspectors, including one who speaks Chinese and another who speaks
Spanish, walk though the front door.;    "What's the problem? What's the
problem?" cries the Korean-born owner racing down the steps.;    "Typical,"
said Joseph Halik, one of 18 state inspectors assigned to monitor the garment
industry. "You have child labor, fire violations, wage violations. You see it
everywhere.";    Decades after labor reforms wiped out so-called sweatshop
factories, some garment shops are throwbacks to another time, experts and
officials say.;    More low-paid foreign competition;    In New York, the hub
of the U.S. "needle trade," state inspectors report an apparent rise in the
number of illegal shops -- dingy and dangerous places where elderly workers
may toil alongside school-age children for wages well below the $4.30-an-hour
minimum wage.;    Some of the problems are traced to low-paid foreign
competition, which has reduced New York's garment workforce to about 100,000
from more than 150,000 in the late '70s. But the stumbling U.S. economy also
has pushed clothing retailers and designers to cut costs, and garment-making
shops have followed suit by dropping wages and increasing hours, officials
said.;    And those who work in illegal shops -- including many illegal
immigrants -- are often too scared or unfamiliar with the city to report
violations, say inspectors.;    "There's a word for what's going on: greed,"
said Hugh McDaid, head of the state Labor Department's Apparel Industry Task
Force. "Everyone is trying to squeeze a little extra money and it trickles
down to the workers, who pay the price in low wages and long hours.";   
6-year-olds in the factory;    McDaid estimates there are up to 6,000
garment-makers in New York, including at least 2,000 unlicensed shops in
lofts, back rooms and garages. The remaining 4,000 are registered with the
state and offer at least minimum wage, he said.;    Halik said most of the
sweatshops have opened since 1985 in Queens and Brooklyn, where many
immigrants live. Some shops may have several generations of workers from the
same family, he said.;    "The quest for cheap labor knows no bounds," said
Jeffrey Newman, executive director of the New York-based National Child Labor
Committee. "There are 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds out there sweeping floors and
sewing on buttons.";    In more than 5,000 investigations since 1987, the task
force has uncovered about 2,100 unregistered shops and more than 600 child
labor violations, according to state records. There have been 500 minimum-wage
violations and about 2,000 reports of unsafe working conditions.;    Each
violation carries a maximum $1,000 fine.;    "But the bosses just close up,
move down the block and open under a different name. As long as there is work,
they'll find a way to stay open," said task force supervisor Charles
DeSiervo.;    Poor record keeping;    The inspectors visit another shop
located over a billiards hall. About 50 workers, mostly Asian women, are
hunched over sewing machines.;    Some wrap their noses with cloth to protect
against breathing lint and dust. In another section, young men cut material
and ironed finished garments -- women's suits and children's outfits. Some
carry the Jordache label.;    DeSiervo finds copies of pay checks ranging from
about $250 to $420. None of the time-clock cards have been punched on this
day.;    "Who knows what this means?" said DeSiervo, waving the copies. "This
could be for 100 hours or for more than one worker. Sometimes families work a
machine 24 hours a day in shifts.";    One worker, an illegal alien from the
Dominican Republic who would not give her name, says she earns $300 a week for
about 70 hours at the machine.;    "If you have no green card, where are you
going to work? I don't know," she says.;    Inspectors find 14- and
15-year-old workers, in violation of laws prohibiting those under 16 years old
from working in factories.;    Often, the inspectors make reference to the
1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Co. fire in New York, which killed 146 workers.;   
"Don't think it can't happen again," said DeSiervo. "I know it can.";    Much
of the men's clothing sold in the United States is now made overseas, but many
women's and children's fashions are still in New York or in the emerging
garment-making centers of Los Angeles or El Paso, Texas.;    Some designers
disagree that illegal shops have taken away a significant amount of business
from the established makers.;    "Most manufacturers go with the people
they've worked with for years and they trust," said Eli Elias, president of
the New York Apparel Manufacturer's Association. "These so-called sweatshops
are too risky.";    Task force inspectors, however, say they noticed no
slowdown this year in the work at the illegal shops. Some operate
round-the-clock to meet deadlines for spring clothing lines.;    A call for
reforms;    But hard work doesn't always mean pay, say activists.;    Wing
Lam, program director of the Chinese Staff and Workers Association, said he's
seen a trend among Chinatown shops to close up and leave workers without
paychecks.;    Lam's group and others have urged for reforms to make designers
more liable for the conditions in garment shops.;    In January, U.S. Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed a bill to increase penalties to $10,000 or a
year in jail for repeat offenders and allow authorities to seize garments. A
similar proposal by Schumer failed last year.;    Meanwhile, waves of
immigrants continue to feed the garment industry with workers, said Vernon
Briggs, professor of labor economics at Cornell University.;    "As long as we
have Third World workers used to Third World conditions with Third World
attitudes, the exploitation will always be there," he said.  </TEXT>
