   The owner of a Bronx social club where a fire
killed six patrons was arrested Thursday and charged with
manslaughter and assault for maintaining the basement club in a
reckless manner, police said.
   Domingo Reyes, 37, of the Bronx, was arrested at a pay phone in
Manhattan after police traced a 45-minute call he made from a phone
booth to a precinct house, said police spokesman Sgt. Maurice
Howard.
   He was charged with six counts of second-degree manslaughter and
some 40 counts of assault for every person that was in the club
last Sunday at the time of the fire, he said.
   ``The section of the penal law that he's charged with, it covers
death caused in a reckless manner,'' said Howard. ``He maintained
the club in such a way it was reckless and that's where his
responsibility to the deaths comes in,'' he said.
   Howard said police had been searching for Reyes since the fire
at the Bronx club, known as The Hole.
   ``He had an impending sense that they were looking for him,''
Howard said in explaining why Reyes may have called police.
   When Reyes saw the unmarked cars pull up to the phone booth and
detectives getting out, ``he ran and there was a brief foot chase''
before he was captured, said Howard.
   Dozens of club patrons were injured in the fire, many severely
burned. Eighteen firefighters also were hurt, none seriously.
   Officials said the club was operated illegally because it served
liquor without a license and didn't have enough exits to comply
with building codes.
   Although arson was initially suspected, the fire was later ruled
to have been accidental.
