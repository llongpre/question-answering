Police slammed shut 23 more illegal social clubs early Sunday, hoping to 
prevent a repeat of the blaze that killed 87 people last week in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown came as the bodies of 48 victims of the Happy Land social club 
fire arrived in Honduras, the impoverished Central American country many had 
left in search of a better life in the United States.

A special police task force has issued vacate orders to a total of 346 illicit 
clubs since a sweep by the city began last Sunday, Officer Anthony Mazzola 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, citing police records, reported Sunday that 52 of the 1,255 
clubs listed as "nuisance" establishments were in properties owned by the city, 
including two in Housing Authority projects. The records portray the city as 
the largest landlord of such clubs.
