   Poor, powerless, alone and rejected, Julio
Gonzalez fits the profile of a revenge arsonist, an expert said
Tuesday. Most chilling, he said, is that such killers rarely
consider the lives they destroy.
   ``They're angry against society. They feel a need to strike
out,'' said John Barracato, a fire investigator and author of a
book on arson. ``They only want to vent their frustration. They
don't care about the other people.''
   Gonzalez, 36, is charged with setting the fire that killed 87
patrons of an unlicensed social club in the Bronx early Sunday.
Police charge he was angry with his ex-girlfriend, who worked there.
   Prosecutors say he has admitted setting the fire in revenge.
   While details are lacking, accounts portray Gonzalez as a quiet
man who lived lawfully but in poverty since his arrival from Cuba a
decade ago. Neighbors said nothing foretold the slaughter of which
he is accused.
   But two blows recently shook his life: Six weeks ago he was
dismissed from the Queens lamp factory where he worked, and at
about the same time he broke up with Lydia Feliciano, with whom he
had lived for seven or eight years.
   Gonzalez allegedly argued with Ms. Feliciano early Sunday at the
Happy Land Social Club, where she was a coat checker. A bouncer
ejected him and, prosecutors said, he left threatening to shut the
place down.
   Police say he bought $1 worth of gasoline, splashed it into the
club's doorway and ignited it. Authorities said his shoes reeked of
gasoline when police arrested him 12 hours later, sleeping in his
10-by-10 foot, $80-a-week furnished room.
   While Barracato could not comment directly about the case, he
said arson for revenge _ which accounts for about half of all arson
cases _ commonly is started with an accelerant such as gasoline and
is intended as revenge against a perceived offense.
   ``When someone gets locked into an anger stage of emotion he
wants total destruction,'' said Barracato, a former deputy chief
city fire marshal and now director of the fire and fraud section of
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co.
   While emotion incites the crime, ``There's no loss of control,''
said Barracato, who conducted a six-year study of arsonists. ``It's
calculated and it's planned. ... They want to assert themselves.
They want power, and what can be more powerful than intentionally
setting a fire.''
   The greatest question about Gonzalez's past is his life in Cuba,
which he left in the Mariel boatlift that brought 125,000 people to
the United States in 1980. He told authorities he was born in
Holguin, in Oriente province, and worked as a mechanic and
construction assistant. He said his nickname was ``Pochocho,'' a
diminutive with no meaning.
   Gonzalez told U.S. immigration officials he had been jailed for
three years in Cuba for an unapproved absence from the Army, and
that he had falsely confessed to drug trafficking so Cuban
authorities would let him join the boatlift.
   After his arrival, he was detained in U.S. camps for nine
months, then released.
   U.S. officials have complained that Cuba used the boatlift to
cast off criminals and people with mental problems. Cuban officials
in Washington did not return telephone calls Tuesday seeking
information on Gonzalez.
   Barracato said many arsonists have no criminal history, but they
often share other attributes: Poverty, low education, broken homes,
a lack of idols, personal isolation, extreme introversion, low
self-esteem.
   The underclass status faced by many poor immigrants can
contribute to the alienation arsonists seem to share, Barracato
said. The result: Resentment, and, if pushed to the brink, an urge
for revenge.
   ``They don't think that by that act they'll kill people,'' he
said. ``It's, `I'll get even with them.'''
   Typically when it comes to revenge, said Barracato, ``he could
care less'' about victims.
