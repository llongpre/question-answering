   His neighbors say Julio Gonzalez was a quiet man
who sometimes helped them with their chores.
   But police said the Cuban immigrant, angered by the rejection of
a former girlfriend, set fire to the Happy Land Social Club in the
Bronx and killed 87 people.
   ``I ... right now I'm stuttering, I can't ... I'm still in
shock. To have somebody with a demented mind do that and living
here,'' said Yvonne Torres, 29, who lived two rooms away from
Gonzalez.
   The 36-year-old man moved into the rooming house about three
months ago, after he and his girlfriend stopped living together,
police said.
   Gonzalez lived in a sparse room with a bed, a clothes closet and
a picture of Jesus on one wall.
   Many of his neighbors said Gonzalez often offered to help them
carry groceries or do other chores.
   ``He's neat, tidy and well-mannered,'' said the building's
manager, Ray Davis. ``He's not loud or the type of guy you would
notice in a crowd.''
   A police spokesman, Lt. Raymond O'Donnell, said Gonzalez, who
was arrested at home 12 hours after the fire started at 3:40 a.m.
Sunday, used to work in a warehouse but had been unemployed for the
past six months.
   When questioned by police, he broke down and cried and was
remorseful, O'Donnell said.
   Early Sunday, police said, Gonzalez went to the club and argued
with his 45-year-old former girlfriend before he was kicked out by
a bouncer.
   ``He's drinking at the club. He wants to get back with her. She
says, `Leave me alone, leave me alone.' The bouncer ejects him. He
comes back and sets the place on fire,'' O'Donnell said.
   He was charged Sunday with arson and murder, O'Donnell said. He
was led out of the stationhouse Sunday night wearing a bulletproof
vest, which police asked him to wear as a precaution. Gonzalez said
nothing as reporters bombarded him with questions.
   At the boarding house, neighbor Celia Lopez, 37, described
Gonzalez as someone who did not seem to have many friends.
   ``Not many people came to visit him. He never caused any
problems or arguments,'' she said.
   Gonzalez came to the United States in 1980 as part of the Mariel
boatlift that brought 125,000 Cubans to the United States,
O'Donnell said.
   Gonzalez was detained by U.S. immigration officials at Camp
McCoy, Wis., and Fort Chaffee, Ark., until his release on Feb. 21,
1981, said Verne Jervis of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Washington.
   Jervis said Gonzalez was granted parolee status and sent to live
with a sponsor family in New York City, adding, ``We've had no
contact from him since.''
   Gonzalez never applied for permanent residency, which he could
have sought in 1982, and therefore could be deported if ever
convicted of a crime.
   U.S. officials have long accused Cuba of including hardened
criminals among those traveling on the boatlift, but Jervis said
Gonzalez's only criminal record in Cuba was serving ``some time''
in prison for desertion from the Cuban army.
   Luis Rolan, 30, lived next door to Gonzalez's 10-foot by 12-foot
room, which has a small balcony and rented for less than $100 a
week.
   The two would drink beer together, but Gonzalez never mentioned
problems with his girlfriend. ``That was just too personal. We
didn't get into things like that,'' he said.
   ``He's a nice guy. He didn't talk to nobody. He wasn't the kind
who would do this,'' Rolan said.
   ``But you know what they say,'' Davis said. ``It's the quiet guy
you have to watch for.''
