   For Alva Romero, who left Honduras for a better
life in the United States, an American dream ended in the deaths of
six relatives who were among 87 victims of a fire at an illegal
social club.
   Her daughter, her two brothers, a sister, a cousin and a niece
perished in the fire early Sunday morning at the Happy Land club, a
hangout for Latin Americans.
   A grieving Romero, who came to America 2{ years ago, said it
wasn't severe dissatisfaction with Honduras or the country's
political and economic upheavals that prompted her and her
relatives to leave.
   ``This is America. We all would have a chance to do better
here,'' she said as she dabbed her eyes and clutched a picture of
her daughter. ``Now, I don't know.''
   ``We came here to better ourselves,'' Romero said soon after
viewing her relatives' bodies at a morgue, ``but this is what we
get.''
   Her husband remained behind in Honduras, Romero said. Would she
stay in the United States?
   ``I don't know. Everything is changed. I don't know.''
   Romero, 34, worked as a home attendant, helping to feed and
clothe the elderly and sick.
   But now, it was friends and relatives who were helping Romero as
they gathered at a high school where officials posted snapshots of
the dead on the wall.
   Among them were Romero's brothers, aged 33 and 21; her
18-year-old sister, her daughter, also 18, a cousin, 18, and a
niece, 17.
   ``They had been to the club before and they liked it,'' Romero
said. ``It had been three weeks since they had been there.''
   ``And, last night,'' she said, her voice choking with emotion,
``They all decided to go back to the club. I don't know why.''
