   A state appeals court issued a decision three
days before a Bronx social club fire that probably strengthens the
victims' families' chances of successfully suing the owner or
landlord of the fire site.
   One victim's mother has already sued the owners, lessees and
proprietors of the club for $510 million, her lawyer said Thursday.
Many other relatives of the 87 people who died already have
contacted lawyers.
   But their success seems to depend on their ability to collect
from the only potential defendants with substantial assets or
insurance _ the building's owner, Alex DiLorenzo, and its
landlords, Jay Weiss and Morris Jaffe.
   The families' case appears to have been buttressed by a March 22
ruling by a state appeals court.
   In a 3-2 decision, the panel ruled that an owner of real estate
who allows it to be used for an unlawful purpose can be liable for
damages caused by the illegal activity to innocent people who are
not tenants.
   The case involved 9-year-old Miguel Muniz, who was blinded by
stray gunfire from a Harlem building that had been a center of drug
dealing. The appellate panel reversed a judge who had ruled that
the landlord could not be held liable for damages.
   Aaron Broder, the lawyer who represented the boy and is advising
plaintiffs' lawyers in the social club case, said courts have
tended to rule that unless harm to an innocent third party flowed
from a building defect over which a landlord had direct control,
the landlord could not be held liable.
   The social club was the scene of arrests for illegal alcohol
sales and was repeatedly cited for building and safety code
violations, including the lack of fire alarms, sprinklers and
emergency exits. The city's Buildings Department finally ordered it
closed. A copy of the order was tacked to the club's front door,
and at least one copy was supposed to have been sent to Dilorenzo
or Weiss and Jaffe.
   The chain of control begins with DiLorenzo, who owns the
building and gave a 30-year lease to Weiss and Jaffe. They, in
turn, leased the premises to Elias Colon, who operated the social
club.
   Since Colon died in the fire _ and is not thought to have had
substantial assets or insurance _ plaintiffs' attorneys will focus
on the owner and the landlord, arguing that they were aware, or
should have been aware, of the illegal uses of the premises and
should have done something.
   The Muniz case is particularly relevant because, as in the case
of the social club, the landlord already had gone to court seeking
the tenant's eviction for non-payment of rent, not for breaking any
law or regulation.
   ``The court (in Muniz) held that if a landlord has sought to
evict a tenant for non-payment and does not choose to seek eviction
for other reasons, it's evidence of his potential negligence,''
Broder said.
   ``The landlord demonstrated he was capable of using the courts,
but only when it was profitable to him.''
   But a real estate lawyer, Flora Schnall, said the fact Weiss and
Jaffe were trying to evict Colon was more important than why.
Non-payment of rent, she said, ``is the easiest thing to evict
someone for. It's very difficult to evict someone for illegal
uses.''
