   The Sandinistas have agreed to cede
control of the army and police in a preliminary agreement with
advisers to President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro on
transferring power.
   The agreement, reached late Tuesday, stresses that the
demobilization of the Contra rebels is crucial if a civilian
government led by Mrs. Chamorro is to take over from the
Sandinistas on April 25 as scheduled.
   Dismantling of the rebel force that once had strong U.S. backing
``constitutes an essential element for creating the climate of
peace, stability and tranquility in which the transfer of
government should take place,'' the agreement says.
   The heads of the transition teams signed the preliminary
agreement after a month of negotiations. Mrs. Chamorro defeated
President Daniel Ortega in free elections on Feb. 25.

   Federal aviation authorities will no longer
fine airlines for safety violations if the carriers find the
problem themselves, quickly correct it and report it to the
government.
   Federal Aviation Administration chief James B. Busey announced
the new policy Tuesday at a luncheon with airline officials. An
industry spokesman applauded the policy change, but a pilots' group
cautioned against a falldown in FAA enforcement.
   Busey acknowledged that his agency, which monitors safety at
airports used by U.S. carriers throughout the world, doesn't have
enough manpower to catch every violation. He said airlines have the
responsibility to audit their own safety.
   ``We cannot police every aspect of the industry, cannot crawl
through the belly of every aircraft, look over the shoulder of
every pilot, or personally screen every passenger and every piece
of luggage that flies in the system,'' the FAA administrator said.

   Cuba is expected to take additional measures
against the United States in retaliation for U.S.-sponsored
television programming to the island, producing further setbacks to
the already strained relationship.
   After Cuban authorities jammed the initial broadcasts of TV
Marti on Tuesday, the State Department expressed regret but said
transmissions will continue.
   The emphasis was on entertainment as testing began, but a
primary goal of the station is to provide objective news to a
country that the administration says has received none in 31 years.
   The station is a pet project of conservative elements of the
Cuban exile community in Florida, and Cuban officials have told
U.S. diplomats that exiles may be a target of Cuban retaliation.

   Prosecutors intend to use a pair of
gasoline-soaked sneakers and a hunk of dance floor to help make
their case against a man charged with setting the fire that killed
87 people in a social club.
   A grand jury Tuesday began hearing evidence against 36-year-old
Julio Gonzalez, charged with 87 murders in the blaze at the Happy
Land Social Club in the Bronx. Police said he set the fire early
Sunday after being snubbed by an ex-girlfriend who worked there.
   ``We'll have a made case even if he backs out of the
confession,'' said Edward McCarthy, spokesman for the Bronx
prosecutor's office.
   The club had been ordered closed for fire and safety code
violations and the landlord was trying to evict the owner for
non-payment of rent.

   Eight years after an auto accident left him
in a vegetative state, a man given a tranquilizer in a dentist's
office fell asleep, woke up and started to speak. Soon he could say
his name, walk and feed himself, a doctor says.
   Dr. Andres Kanner, a neurologist with the University of
Wisconsin Hospital, said Tuesday it's a mystery why tranquilizers
awakened the man.
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Kanner said. ``It was just luck he
had to have some dental work and it was just luck they administered
the drugs.''
   The patient, identified only as a Wisconsin man in his mid-40s,
had been in a vegetative state, not a coma: His eyes were open and
he occasionally uttered words, but he could do nothing else, the
doctor said in an interview Tuesday.
