   The lawyer for a man accused of setting a fire
that killed 87 people at a social club declared in court Wednesday
his intention to use an insanity defense.
   Defense lawyer Richard Berne said he would use the insanity
defense for Julio Gonzalez, who is charged with murder and arson
for the March fire at the Happy Land unlicensed nightclub.
   Gonzalez returns to state Supreme Court in the Bronx Nov. 15,
when reports of psychiatric evaluations performed on him by both
sides will be turned over to the court and a date will be set for
his trial.
   Gonzalez, 36, allegedly set the blaze with a dollar's worth of
gasoline after a fight with his ex-girlfriend, who worked at the
club.
