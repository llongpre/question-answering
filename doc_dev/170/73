   The landlord of a social club destroyed in an
arson fire that claimed 87 lives surrendered Tuesday on an arrest
warrant issued 14 months ago when he failed to appear on charges of
safety violations.
   The building owner, Alex DiLorenzo III, could face 90 days in
jail and a $5,000 fine if convicted of knowingly allowing an
illegal club in his building.
   The Happy Land Social Club was destroyed March 25 when a Cuban
refugee allegedly torched the place after a fight with his
girlfriend, police said. He has been charged with 87 murders.
   DiLorenzo is accused of lacking a club permit and failing to
install sprinklers and emergency lights. He was released without
bail by Bronx Criminal Court Judge Harold Enten, with a hearing set
for April 20, police said. He is accused of lacking a club permit
and failing to install sprinklers and emergency lights.
   The city ordered the club closed in November 1988, to no avail.
Officials said they had notified DiLorenzo in writing of the
violations; on Feb. 3, 1989, when he failed to appear for a
hearing, the warrant for his arrest was issued by Criminal Court
Judge James E. Robinson.
