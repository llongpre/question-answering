<LEADPARA>  New York City firefighters testifying Friday in the Happy Land social club
arson-murder trial told gruesome tales of stumbling upon heaps of dead bodies
too numerous to count. Prosecutors say Julio Gonzalez set the blaze with
gasoline after an argument with an ex-girlfriend, who worked as a coat-checker
in the Bronx club. His attorney, Richard Berne, conceded Gonzalez set the fire
but said Gonzalez was insane at the time and could not be held criminally
responsible. The March 25, 1990, fire killed 87 people. Only six survived.  </LEADPARA>
