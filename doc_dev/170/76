   A fire at a basement social club that killed
seven people in the Bronx was not arson as originally suspected,
fire officials said Monday.
   ``We believe at this point that the fire was accidental, but
many important witnesses who were badly injured have yet to be
interviewed by fire marshals,'' said Fire Department spokesman John
Mulligan.
   Arson had been suspected because of the rapid spread of the
Sunday fire.
   Dozens of injured patrons, many severely burned, remain at eight
hospitals. Eighteen firefighters also were injured, none seriously.
   The club, known as The Cave or The Hole, has been raided by
police five times since March, and there have been nine arrests,
said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for Mayor Edward Koch. ``And the people
have been let go on violations, which is not a misdemeanor. Two
misdemeanors (within a year) allows the police commissioner to
close the place under the padlock law.''
   In a raid, police confiscate liquor and money, kick everyone out
and arrest the employees, Kelly said. ``Once in a while they arrest
the patrons.''
   The club in the Bronx does not have a liquor license, Kelly said.
   Most social clubs operate like bottle clubs in other states,
where customers bring their own liquor and get mixers from the
management.
   The club was a 50-by-75 foot T-shaped space partitioned into
several rooms, with a bar at either side of the front entrance and
a disc jockey's stand at the rear. Just past the bars were several
tables and an area set aside for dancing.
   Patrons passed through a narrow doorway between a realty office
and a store. Neighborhood residents said the entrance was always
blocked by a shopkeeper's steel gate. A steel cellar door on the
side street was locked.
   Mulligan described the steep, narrow staircase that led down to
the club as ``no better than a ladder.''
