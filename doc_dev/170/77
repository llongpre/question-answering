   The owner of an illegally operated Bronx social
club was arrested after a four-day search and charged with
manslaughter and assault in connection with a fire that killed six
people and injured 33, police said.
   The fire Sunday burned out the basement club, known as The Hole,
which officials say served liquor without a license and didn't have
enough exits to comply with building codes.
   Although arson was initially suspected, the Fire Department
later said the fire appeared to be accidental.
   Domingo Reyes, 37, the owner and operator of the club, was
arrested at a pay phone in Manhattan at 6:30 p.m. Thursday after
police traced a 45-minute call he made to the 46th Precinct, said
police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   He was charged with six counts of second-degree manslaughter and
40 counts of assault for every person who was in the club at the
time of the fire, Howard said.
