   Legal liability for the social club fire that
left 87 dead depends on the answers to three questions, according
to some of the city's top lawyers.
   Did the owner and landlord know about the unsafe and illegal
condition of the Happy Land Social Club? What could they have done
about it? And what did they try to do about it?
   The lawyers say those questions deal primarily with matters of
fact, not law, and resist immediate answers.
   ``Everyone's jumping into the pot and pointing the blame, even
though we don't know what happened, and won't know for sure until
the pre-trial stage of any litigation,'' said Bernard Rifkin,
chairman of the real property committee of the state bar
association.
   ``It all depends on the facts,'' agreed Karl Holtzschue,
Rifkin's counterpart at the city bar association. ``If they (the
building owner and the landlord) knew there was something wrong and
didn't do something, they might have some liability. But this is an
area of law that's very fact-specific.''
   Three people held varying degrees of control over the building
in which the club was located.
   The club operator, Elias Colon, died in the fire. Jay Weiss and
Morris Jaffe, whose company, One Peach Associates, held a 30-year
lease for the property, subleased it to Colon. Alexander DiLorenzo
III, who owned the building, leased it to One Peach.
   Lawyers agreed that the chance of criminal charges was slim,
because the fire was apparently the result of arson. But when such
a tragedy occurs, victims' families search for the deepest pockets
to sue. In this case, Holtzschue noted, ``The operator paid for
what he did with his life. You can't get any more out of his hide.''
   That leaves the owner and One Peach, as well as those who will
probably call the defense legal shots in any lawsuit _ their
insurance companies.
   But what DiLorenzo, Weiss and Jaffe knew, what they did and what
they could have done remains unclear.
   The unlicensed club Colon operated had been the scene of arrests
for the illegal sale of alcohol. It had been cited for serious
building and safety code violations and had been ordered to close
in late 1988.
   Colon's lease from Weiss specified that the building was not to
allow any person under the age of 21 years to enter.
   If ``any governmental authority'' complained about the club, the
lease gave the landlord the right to evict the club unless it
quickly corrected the problem.
   The city, of course, did complain, and minors were served, but
did the owner or landlord know? The city says it sent copies of
vacate orders out, but it appears only DiLorenzo received one.
   Weiss's attorneys said they never were formally notified of the
violations, but declined to say if they knew about them anyway.
   One of Weiss's attorneys said his client was not closely
involved with the property. Alan Vogeler told The New York Times
that Weiss, husband of actress Kathleen Turner, had never been
inside the social club and had not visited the property since April
1989. Jaffe's role remains unclear.
   Weiss and Jaffe, however, were trying to evict Colon; that
usually would be a legal mark in their favor, but they apparently
were doing so only because that Colon had not paid his rent.
   Rifkin questioned how much Weiss and Jaffe could have done to
get rid of Colon or correct the building's problems. Because of
city laws and court policies that protect tenants, he said,
``Anytime you try to evict anyone, you've got a nightmare.''
