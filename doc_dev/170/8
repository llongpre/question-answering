   A suspicious fire swept through a jam-packed,
illegal social club for Latin immigrants in the Bronx early Sunday,
killing at least 87 people, fire officials said.
   The fire, the worst in the continental United States in 13
years, was reported at the Happy Land Social Club near the Bronx
Zoo at 3:41 a.m. and quickly spread through the two-story brick
building. Authorities and witnesses said the panic-stricken victims
were trapped and only one man apparently managed to escape,
severely burned.
   ``This is the worst thing I have seen in my career. It hurt my
stomach. It was sickening,'' said Emergency Medical Services
specialist Christopher McCarthy.
   ``Most of the bodies were in dance clothes,'' he said. ``They
were out to have fun. ... I saw wall-to-wall bodies _ an indication
of mass confusion and panic.''
   The blaze was brought under control by 6 a.m., said a fire
department spokesman, Lee Rodriguez.
   Officials said the fire's rapid spread suggested an accelerant
was used. ``That heavy volume of fire immediately arouses
suspicion,'' said Assistant Fire Chief Robert Ungar.
   One witness heard what sounded like gunshots before the fire.
But Unger would not comment on reports that there was a fight
before the fire broke out or that gasoline cans were found at the
scene.
   EMS Lt. Roy David said he got to the scene just a man believed
to be the lone survivor, apparently the club's disc jockey, was
staggering out.
   ``He walked toward me,'' David said. ``He couldn't talk. He
couldn't say anything. All we could do was treat him.''
   Another witness, Victor Perry, said: ``There were no people
coming out. The DJ's clothes were stuck to his burnt skin which was
coming off.''
   The building received an eviction notice in January because of
improper exits, and was in the process of being condemned, said
Building Commissioner Charles Smith.
   ``The sad part of it is that this did not have to happen,'' said
Mayor David Dinkins, who visited the scene a few hours after the
fire. Many of an estimateed 700 similar clubs operating in New York
City may be unsafe, and are being investigated, he said.
   A fire at another Bronx social club killed 25 people on Oct. 24,
1976.
   Ungar put the death toll at 87 or 88 people. A makeshift morgue
was set up in the building next door, and relatives gathered at the
scene. Authorities said the victims were mostly Latin immigrants,
primarily Hondurans.
   Lynn Schulman, an EMS spokeswoman, said most of the victims died
from smoke inhalation, but added, ``Some people were trampled.''
   She said the survivor was a 25-year-old man who suffered
second-and third-degree burns on his arms and legs and was taken to
Jacobi Hospital in guarded condition.
   Five firefighters, including a battalion chief who broke his
leg, were taken to Jacobi Hospital after inhaling smoke and at
least six other firefighters were treated for minor smoke
inhalation at the scene, she said.
   Perry said three sounds like gunshots were heard just prior to
the fire in the building that housed the club, which was only 20
feet by 50 feet.
   Rosemary Green, whose sister-in-law and cousin were at the club,
said she and other people were coming from a neighborhood birthday
party and going to club when she encountered the scene.
   ``People were screaming. They were all burned. ... We're looking
for friends and relatives and nobody's telling us anything,'' she
said. ``Once you got in the entrance there was no way to get out.''
   The building housed a group that organized children's baseball
as well as adult socializing, said Lillian Rivera, a neighbor who
lives across the street from the club.
   At least 30 firefighters from six companies were called to the
scene, Rodriguez said.
   The fire was the deadliest in the continental United States
since a May 28, 1977, blaze that consumed the Beverly Hills Supper
Club in Southgate, Ky., killing 164 people. A Dec. 31, 1986, fire
at a hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, killed 96
people.
   Sunday's fire occurred on the 79th anniversary of one of New
York City's worst fires, the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. blaze that
killed 145 people, most of them immigrant workers. The fire led to
reforms governing safety of the workplace.
