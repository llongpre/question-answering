   Once it was a wall; by Wednesday, it was a
memorial.
   Students at Roosevelt High School, who lost five classmates in
the Happy Land social club fire, covered a second-floor hallway
with flowers and scrawled goodbyes in a tribute to the dead youths.
   ``I wish you are all in HEAVEN. I'll meet you there, my friends!
I miss you,'' wrote one student at the school, which is attended by
about 140 youths of Honduran descent.
   ``Our family, our friends. We will never forget. May your souls
rest in peace,'' said another message.
   The remembrances came in English and Spanish; flowers, now
wilted, were stapled along the length of the 28-foot tribute.
Teachers joined students in sharing their grief over the loss of
people who two weeks earlier had partied with them at a high school
dance.
   ``Norman _ you were a wonderful student, a joy to have in
class,'' wrote one teacher. ``Always smiling, bright-eyed,
sensitive, respectful, kind, humorous, a wonderful son. I will
always keep you in my heart and pray for you.''
   Above the scores of names and messages was a computer-printed
sign flanked by bouquets of paper roses. ``In memory of Wendy,
Alba, Isabel, Norman, Ernesto,'' it simply said. All five died
early Sunday; the messages first appeared Monday morning.
   Norman Clark was the youngest of the five Roosevelt students
killed. He and three others attended the school this year. The
fifth, Ernesto Gamoneda, was in the class of '89.
   Wendy Manaiza, 18, planned to attend college following her
graduation this June. Alba Escuto went to the club with her
boyfriend, Juan Carlos Colon; her cousin, 17-year-old Isabel Lopez,
also was there.
   Funeral services for the five teen-agers were expected to begin
Thursday.
   ``They were beautiful kids,'' recalled the principal, Paul
Shapiro. ``The school is suffering together on this. This is not
business as usual. Business is not as usual.''
   Friends of the dead youths arrived at school Monday morning
badly shaken, some sobbing and screaming uncontrollably as they met
with counselors assigned to the school to help students through the
tragedy.
   More than 400 students came in to talk about the tragedy and its
effects on them. Part of the healing process was creation of the
memorial, counselors said.
   ``It was an ice-breaker in trying to get something positive out
of this,'' said Cecilio Rodriguez, a former Roosevelt teacher and
now a member of the Bronx high school crisis response team.
   ``Some of the Honduran kids, who spoke no English, asked how to
write `God bless you' or `We miss you' in English,'' he said.
``They wanted everybody to understand their message.''
   Students told the counselors their friends went to the Happy
Land after a party attended by many Roosevelt students; several who
stayed at the party felt guilty about surviving.
   ``They had to confront that: `I was with so and so two hours
before at the party.' It's mortality _ here today, gone tomorrow.
Kids that age think they're invincible,'' said Milta Vega, a drug
counselor at the school.
   The deaths were keenly felt at the school of 3,300 students, 60
percent of whom are Hispanic. Counselors said students of varying
ethnic backgrounds were brought together in mourning.
   ``It was almost beautiful to see the way they came together,''
Rodriguez said Tuesday afternoon. ``There was a good spiritual
energy generated by the end of the day.''
   The counselors, while pleased with the progress made so far, say
there's more work to be done at Roosevelt.
   ``These kids live in an area where there are 6,000 Hondurans
within 10 blocks,'' said Ms. Vega. ``They will pass by the club
every day on the way to school. It's really important to have a
crisis team here for them.''
