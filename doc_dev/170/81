   The Academy Awards celebrated movies low in
budget but rich in talent as ``Driving Miss Daisy'' took the Oscar
for best picture and actress, while ``My Left Foot'' won for best
actor and supporting actress.
   Jessica Tandy, who played the combative Southern widow who'd
rather walk in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' became the oldest performer
to win an Oscar at age 80.
   A surprised Miss Tandy wondered aloud why the producers cast an
actress whose career has mostly been on stage to play a lead in a
movie.
   ``I think I'm very lucky they trusted me with such a wonderful
part,'' she said backstage at the Los Angeles Music Center. ``I
never thought of myself as a movie actress.''

   A Cuban immigrant accused of torching a club to
avenge a romantic snub was under a suicide watch in a psychiatric
ward today after allegedly telling police he set the blaze because
``the devil got into me.''
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was taken Monday from a city jail to Kings
County Hospital after allegedly confessing to setting the fire
Sunday that killed 87 people at the jammed Happy Land Social Club,
an illegal Bronx nightspot.
   Police said Gonzalez, accused of the biggest mass murder in the
continental United States, was remorseful and in tears when
questioned about the fire.
   District Attorney Robert Johnson is investigating the building's
ownership and lease to determine whether the landlords or owner
face liabilities for allowing the club to operate despite a
shutdown order, the Daily News reported today.

   The government is examining $328,000 in
political donations by the chairman of a failed Florida thrift,
while a top regulator says the institution's failure could rival
the $2.5 billion collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   A ``fraud squad'' of federal examiners is investigating the
legality of contributions from CenTrust Savings Bank Chairman David
L. Paul to state and national politicians, said L. William Seidman,
head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution
Trust Corp.
   The propriety of meetings between Paul and politicians and
regulators also is being examined, Seidman said Monday. Any
evidence of wrongdoing will be given to the Justice Department, he
said.
   Seidman, in testimony to the House Banking Committee, said the
failure of Miami-based CenTrust, Florida's largest S&amp;L, will cost
taxpayers ``probably in excess of $2 billion.''

   With the ink barely dry on a Contra
promise to disband by mid-April, U.S.-backed rebels have streamed
into Nicaragua and their military leader says they won't disarm
until the Sandinista army does.
   ``We are speaking of total demobilization _ that includes both
ourselves and the Sandinistas,'' rebel military chief, Israel
Galeano, said Monday.
   International observers said there appeared a split among the
Contras over the pact signed Friday in Honduras. Rebel loyalty
seemed divided between Oscar Sovalbarro, a commander who signed the
agreement, and Galeano, who did not.
   The Sandinistas, defeated at the polls last month, have said
they won't hand over control of the army and police to the new
government headed by Violeta Chamorro until the U.S.-backed rebels
turn in their weapons.

   U.S. Capitol police officials cope with
terrorist threats, tourists and foreign leaders, but their toughest
current challenge may be allegations of racism aired by their own
black officers.
   The accusations have left the police force racially polarized.
Black officers have accused top commanders, all white, of
discrimination. The police brass has denied the allegations, and
white officers have backed their superiors.
   Blacks brought their grievances to a House hearing last week,
appearing in such large numbers that a police security detail
normally would have been assigned to crowd control.
   This time it wasn't necessary, because the orderly spectators _
and key witnesses _ at the House Administration subcommittee
hearing were the police.
