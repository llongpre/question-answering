The husband of actress Kathleen Turner is one of the landlords of the illegal 
social club where arson killed 87 people, his lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Boyle said in a statement that Jay Weiss and a partner, Morris Jaffe, 
principals of Little Peach Realty Inc., leased the Bronx site in 1985 from 
Clarendon Place, a corporation controlled by Alex DiLorenzo III. 
</P>
<P>
Little Peach sublet the property in 1987 to Elias Colon, who operated the Happy 
Land social club and was one of the 87 who died there early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle added that Little Peach had been trying to evict Colon and that an 
eviction trial was scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bronx Dist. Atty. Robert Johnson has said his staff is working on sorting out 
the ownership of the building and looking into whether anyone in the corporate 
chain bears criminal liability in the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Turner and Weiss married in August, 1984, after a romance that started when he 
helped her find a Manhattan apartment.
