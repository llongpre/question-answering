   A man bounced from a Bronx social club for
quarreling with an ex-girlfriend returned with a jug of gasoline
and set a fire that killed 87 people at the nightspot, which had
been ordered closed, police said.
   Most of the dead suffocated in thick smoke in the pre-dawn blaze
Sunday, authorities said. Some people were trampled to death;
others broke a hole through a wall to an adjoining hall in a
desperate attempt to live.
   Emergency workers described bodies felled by smoke so quickly
that they still had their legs wrapped around a bar stool, gripped
drinks or held hands. Only three people managed to reach safety by
way of the two tiny exit doors on the front of the two-story Happy
Land social club.
   ``People literally were stacked on top of each other,'' said
Anthony De Vita, the Fire Department's command chief. ``It was a
firetrap.''

   In Hungary's first free parliamentary
elections in more than 40 years, voters overwhelmingly chose
opposition candidates over the Communist reformers who ended
one-party rule, partial results indicated today.
   It appeared likely that a coalition of opposition parties, who
say they will not permit members of the long-ruling party in the
new government, would be running the former Soviet client state.
   With 18 percent of the vote in from Sunday's balloting, the
conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum led with 23.8 percent and
the liberal League of Free Democrats was second with 20.5 percent,
the state news agency MTI said.
   The Independent Smallholders, a revived pre-World War II party
popular in Hungary's villages, had 13.1 percent, with the
Socialists, the successors to the Communists, trailing with 10
percent, MTI said.

   Former Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph
Hazelwood has left town and the voices of protest that marked the
first anniversary of the nation's worst oil spill have quieted.
Now, the legal cleanup begins.
   With more than 150 lawsuits on file against Exxon Corp.,
Hazelwood and others, Alaska's court calendars will be clogged for
years to come.
   Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Co., the oil company consortium that
operates the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and Valdez terminal, also
have been indicted by a federal grand jury on five criminal counts
stemming from the grounding of the Exxon Valdez.
   The tanker hemorrhaged nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude
oil into Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, killing countless
birds, fish and other wildlife and fouling the rocky shore for
hundreds of miles.

   After months of appearing paralyzed by
President Bush's high poll ratings, the Democrats have shifted into
a campaign mode and begun to sound like a party ready to challenge
Bush in the 1992 election.
   During weekend meetings in New Orleans and Indianapolis, the
Democrats took on the popular Republican president on a range of
domestic issues including Social Security, the environment,
abortion and education.
   The party's newly aggressive stance was not arrived at easily.
It exposed the differing approaches of state party officials hungry
for effective campaign issues and the congressional wing, whose
members must often search for compromises with their Republican
colleagues and the White House.
   Regardless of their differences on specific issues, the
Democrats clearly agreed with party Chairman Ronald H. Brown's
assessment that the president has been getting a ``free ride'' and
that it was time to challenge him.

   Losing weight is a growing business, and the
$33 billion Americans spent to shed pounds last year usually
brought poor and sometimes life-threatening results, a House
subcommittee chairman and staff charged.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said federal agencies have failed to
provide adequate consumer protection or guarantee medical safety in
the unregulated diet business _ including popular liquid diets.
   ``The result has been a tidal wave of false and misleading
advertising in a field already awash in gross over-promotion,''' he
said.
   Wyden was opening a hearing today on the issue by his House
Small Business subcommittee on regulation.
