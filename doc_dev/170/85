   Progress has been slow in coming to
this small, dusty town, and Jose Manuel Marquez Hernandez was among
its young people who turned to the United States to seek their
future.
   For Marquez, 24, the immigrant's dream of a better life ended on
March 25 in a fire at the Happy Land social club in the Bronx, New
York City. He and six other young Hondurans were buried this week
in El Progreso, a town of 30,000.
   They were among 87 people killed in the fire. At least 78 were
Hondurans, most from the northern Atlantic coast region.
   The local victims came from poor families and had limited
choices: a lowly job at one of the U.S. fruit companies that made
Honduras the original ``banana republic;'' a dead-end job in San
Pedro Sula, a coastal industrial center of 600,000 people, or New
York, a promised land of jobs, education, opportunity.
   Marquez left six years ago, when just a teen-ager.
   ``He wrote me last month,'' said Gregorio Hernandez, his uncle.
``He had gotten his high school equivalency diploma; he was
applying to go to college.''
   Meanwhile, Marquez worked at a factory, cutting leather to make
clothing, handbags, shoes. Even at minimum wage, he earned enough
to survive and send money home to his mother.
   ``I wrote him back,'' Hernandez said. ``I said: become a
professional. A professional never goes hungry. A professional
lands on his feet anywhere life throws him.''
   Hernandez was the first person in his family of nine children to
finish high school. ``My three older brothers only finished the
eighth grade because back then there wasn't a high school here and
my father didn't have the money to send them to San Pedro Sula,''
Hernandez said.
   The brothers worked for the Tela Railroad Co., a subsidiary of
Chiquita Brands, which has extensive banana plantations in Honduras.
   Hernandez became a supervisor at a textile factory in San Pedro
Sula and assumed the leadership of the extended family clan because
of his education and his job in the big city.
   Wanting something better for his own children and those of his
brothers and sisters, he sent his daughter and Marquez to New York
to live with relatives.
   ``He never once failed with his monthly money for his mother and
his brothers and sister,'' said Hernandez.
   When Marquez's older sister, one of four children, started
college in San Pedro Sula, Marquez sent her a new typewriter. When
he came home for Christmas, he brought gifts: a book for an aunt,
sunglasses for his twin younger brothers, a small stereo for the
family, money for his mother, who has been separated from his
father for years.
   ``He was her sole support,'' said Hernandez.
   Marquez's Christmas visit was the first since he left El
Progreso.
   Last Sunday he returned in a slate blue coffin on a Red Cross
charter jet that carried the bodies of 47 other Hondurans as well.
   The Hernandez clan and neighborhood friends met him, as they had
at Christmas.
   ``We've had to borrow money to pay for the funeral and the plot
in the cemetery, about 1,200 lempiras ($300),'' said Hernandez.
``We're not rich. but we had to give him a proper burial.''
   At the crowded cemetery in El Progreso, a boyhood friend, Jose
Cardenas, 24, perched on one of the simple, cement-covered graves
painted pink, blue and white and overrun with weeds and dust from
unpaved streets.
   Cardenas had also gone to New York, but was deported last year
as an illegal alien.
   ``Leaving here for New York is a change of life for the better,
because there is nothing here,'' he said as Marquez's funeral
procession arrived.
   ``You stay here and do this,'' he said, pointing to a rag-clad
grave digger, ``or you go to New York.''
