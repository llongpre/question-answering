   The basement warren called The Hole where fire
claimed seven lives is one of hundreds of illegal ``social clubs''
dotting the city's poorer neighborhoods that continue to operate
despite repeated police raids.
   More than 30 people were injured in the fire at the Bronx club
Sunday afternoon as 60 to 100 panicked patrons tried to escape
through the lone exit.
   Despite periodic campaigns to close them down, social clubs _ a
local term everyone admits is misleading _ have been centers of
urban problems ranging from noise and double-parking to gambling,
prostitution and drug dealing.
   Police had raided The Hole five times since March to try to shut
it down.
   Rife with building, health and fire code violations, the clubs
repeatedly have been the scene of serious fires, including one in
Brooklyn three years ago that killed five people.
   Such clubs are common in large cities. In 1967 a police raid on
an illegal club in Detroit _ ``blind pig'' was the local term _
sparked days of rioting.
   In New York City, alcohol is sold without a license at more than
200 locations, according to estimates by police precinct
commanders. Clubs have operated in the past at another 400
locations and could reopen any time.
   Some were closed under the city's ``padlock law,'' which allows
police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are committed
on the site within a 12-month period.
   But police have been unable to close many other clubs. The Hole,
first raided in May 1984, is a prime example.
   Police hit the club five times between March 22 and July 26,
seizing cash and liquor and arresting a total of nine people, most
of them employees charged with selling liquor without a state
license. But the club never stayed closed because the police
couldn't get even the two criminal convictions needed under the
padlock law.
   When the fire broke out Sunday most of the cases were still
plodding through the city's overloaded court system. In the three
that were resolved, defendants were allowed to plead guilty to
disorderly conduct and pay fines of between $50 and $100.
   ``That is useless to us,'' said Deputy Inspector Frank Biehler,
because disorderly conduct does not qualify as a criminal
conviction under the padlock law.
   The fines were particularly puny compared to those prescribed
for violations of the liquor law _ about $10,000 each.
   Despite the label, places like The Hole are neither social nor
clubs.
   ``The consumption of alcohol is often of secondary importance,''
a state task force report said. ``The primary function of these
operations has developed into prostitution, gambling, drugs and
trafficking in stolen property.''
   City police have made 1,128 arrests at clubs in the past 12
months.
   New York State liquor licenses cost up to $5,100 and are good
for three years. But many people do not apply for one, often
because they have a criminal record or plan to employ others who do.
   Also, if a bar is not licensed it doesn't have to worry about
state inspectors ``coming in and seeing things they don't want
seen,'' said Richard Chernela, spokesman for the state Liquor
Authority.
   Just about anyone can go to a social club, despite the term's
implication of exclusivity. An employee usually keeps an eye on the
door, but a club member is generally anyone who walks in on a given
night.
   Or morning. While the city's licensed bars are required to close
by 4 a.m., social clubs often are open until dawn or later, usually
to the distress of neighborhood residents.
   When the police do stage a raid, securing evidence is
problematic. ``When we come in, a lot of things hit the floor and
go down the toilet,'' Biehler said.
   Owners are rarely convicted. ``When you arrest a bartender, you
haven't arrested the guy who's really calling the shots, and so the
place is back in business with a new bartender the next day,''
Chernela said.
   ``After a tragedy like this everyone looks at the government,
but it's a very difficult problem,'' said Chernela. ``You close
them and they just spring back up.''
