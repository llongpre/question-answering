   Think you have trouble balancing your checkbook?
Mayor David Dinkins runs a municipal household with a $222 million
electric bill, a $20 million gasoline tab and 103 police horses
that gobble up $70,000 a year in hay and feed pellets.
   New York's $28 billion expense budget is larger than that of any
American city and all but two of the 50 states.
   It's easy to wind up $1.4 billion in the hole when you have
these kinds of costs:
   -$10 million to run Central Park for one year;
   -$12.2 million for a year's supply of disposable plates, cups,
napkins, forks, knives and spoons for school cafeterias;
   -$5,500 a month for 40 pounds of dog chow for each of 18 police
dogs;
   -$4.2 million a year to make, install and repair 67,420 traffic
signs;
   -$4.2 million for a winter's supply of rock salt (135,000 tons).
   If the city's budget is a far cry from the average household's,
it also bears relatively little resemblence to that of any other
municipality in this hemisphere.
   No other U.S. city has more than two public hospitals; New York
has 16, and they consume $4.3 million a year in latex gloves, $1.3
million in needles and syringes, $1.8 million in diapers, infant
and adult.
   Similarly, the city pays an unparalleled $2 billion a year in
public assistance. By one recent count 849,768 New Yorkers are on
welfare, a figure greater than the population of all but 10 U.S.
cities.
   With the economy slumping nationally and in the Northeast, New
York is grappling with a deficit that has prompted comparisons to
the city's near-bankruptcy in 1975.
   On any given day the city spends more than $1 million on
overtime, and much more in times of crisis. After an arson fire
killed 87 people at a Bronx social club, firefighters alone worked
$500,000 in overtime inspecting other such clubs.
   The city's second-quarter overtime king was John McKenna, who
made $16,400, or 29 percent of his $55,400 yearly salary. McKenna,
``senior stationary engineer'' at Queens Hospital Center, was
responsible for the installation of hundreds of new air
conditioners.
   Some of the city's spending figures are simply heartbreaking. On
the night of July 2 it spent $400,000 to house 3,196 homeless
families, 462 of them in barracks-style shelters. As child welfare
department caseloads swelled in the second quarter, social workers
billed $3.4 million in overtime.
   According to a recent count, the city was spending $688 million
yearly to care for 54,712 foster children - $10,805 per child. The
cost is an increase of 166 percent since 1985.
   The city, at least, gets a badly needed break by buying in bulk:
about $18,000 a week for 180,000 eggs and $450,000 a month for
300,000 pounds of poultry. The 23,000 municipal cars, trucks,
tractors, snowblowers, motorcycles and other vehicles, which use
about 17 million gallons of regular unleaded gasoline a year, fill
up at well below the average pump price.
   Some of the costs of local government are fairly esoteric, such
as $300,000 a year to reduce noise and $2.7 million for a two-year
study to determine the origin of trash that washes up on the
beaches. About $5 million goes to plant 12,000 new trees. But since
about 20,000 trees die each year, the tree population still
declines by about 20 a day.
   City officials seem to have a good handle on some costs but not
on others. For instance, last year's bill for English and Spanish
newspapers for the 20,000 jail inmates was $155,230.68. That was
one paper for every 30 inmates, the ratio prescribed by law.
   On the other hand, no one seems to know the final bill for the
11,000 pairs of shoes purchased last year (9,000 of them for the
Corrections Department) or the 1.2 million square feet of netting
to cover garbage barges.
   The telephone bill is another mystery; New York Telephone says
it does not divulge information about any customer's bills.
   This much is known: Earlier this year the Manhattan district
attorney's office discovered that one of its secretaries was
accepting collect calls from her imprisoned boyfriend, and then
transferring his calls - and those of other inmates - to points
across the map. The bill had passed $10,000 before she was fired.
   One last item. The Sanitation Department will replace 9,700 of
its 22,000 curbside litter baskets at a cost of $535,350.
   Where do the old ones go?
   ``People burn leaves in them. And they use them for barbecues,''
said department spokesman Jim Hart. ``I'm not going to their house
for dinner.''
