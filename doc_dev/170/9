   The mother of one of the 87 people killed in a
fire at an illegal social club filed a $510 million lawsuit
Thursday, the first stemming from the inferno, an attorney said.
   The lawsuit seeks that amount in damages from the owners,
lessees and proprietors of the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx.
It also names the man charged with setting the fire.
   Attorney Harry Lipsig said he filed the lawsuit in Bronx state
Supreme Court, New York's trial-level court, on behalf of Jennie
Mae Danzler, mother of Natalie Danzler, 31.
   Lipsig said he also notified city officials he planned to sue
the city ``because of its reckless conduct in connection with the
club.''
   Earlier Thursday, angry City Council members pressed top city
officials about how Happy Land could have remained open despite
repeated warnings that such clubs were catastrophes waiting to
happen.
   ``If you don't learn from the past you're condemned to repeat
its mistakes,'' council member Sheldon S. Leffler said as he
questioned Police Commissioner Lee Brown at a meeting of the
council's Public Safety Committee.
   ``We all bear the blame,'' Bronx Borough President Fernando
Ferrer said outside the meeting. ``We've got to keep the heat on
until we can resolve this problem.''
   The fire occurred early Sunday as the club's patrons, many of
them Honduran immigrants, danced and drank liquor in a building
that lacked a liquor license and violated much of the fire code.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was charged with 87 counts of felony murder,
87 counts of murder through depraved indifference and one count of
attempted murder and arson. Police said he had argued with his
former girlfriend, a worker at the club.
   The City Council itself has come under criticism since the fire
because a bill that would have increased penalties for operating
clubs illegally was allowed to die in committee.
   But on Thursday, council members criticized fire and building
officials over enforcement of existing laws.
   Several council members said they were surprised to learn that
laws giving the city authority to ``seal'' premises were
interpreted as meaning only that a notice could be posted on the
door.
   During several hours of testimony, city officials insisted a
crackdown on unlicensed social clubs was more than a paper threat.
Brown said eight clubs were closed Wednesday night and 15 on
Tuesday by a beefed-up task force of police, fire and buildings
inspectors.
   One establishment ordered closed last year and again Monday was
El Caney, whose board of directors included Mayor David Dinkins'
Hispanic affairs commissioner, William Nieves, the Daily News
disclosed Thursday.
   Dinkins defended his aide at a news conference Thursday, saying
the East Harlem establishment was a non-profit cultural and
educational center, not a commercial social club.
   But he acknowledged that fire and building inspectors found the
building had faulty fire doors and should have been closed. He said
Nieves had resigned from the establishment's board of directors
before taking the city post.
   The building housing Happy Land was owned by real estate
developer Alex DiLorenzo and leased to a group called One Peach
Associates, which is partly owned by Jay Weiss, husband of actress
Kathleen Turner. One Peach sublet the building for $1,950 a month
to club proprieter Elias Colon, who died in the fire.
   The city has been trying since 1988 to close another illegal
Bronx social club in a building owned by DiLorenzo and leased by
Weiss and his partner in One Peach, Morris Jaffe, New York Newsday
reported.
   Weiss's attorneys have said they never were formally notified of
the violations the city found at Happy Land.
   DiLorenzo is the landlord for two other illegal clubs ordered
closed Nov. 20, 1988, The Daily News reported. Those clubs were
ordered shut again this week.
   Separately, DiLorenzo has been accused of 1,585 violations in
four Harlem apartment buildings he owned, 150 of them for
conditions considered imminently dangerous, the News said.
   DiLorenzo's attorney, Mark Friedlander, did not immediately
return a telephone call to his office Thursday.
