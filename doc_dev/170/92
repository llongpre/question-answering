   Police said three suspects showed no remorse
Tuesday when they were charged with murdering a 9-month-old boy by
blindly firing through a door to settle a dispute with the infant's
uncle.
   An angry Mayor David Dinkins, questioned about the fourth
slaying of a child in the city in eight days, asserted that the
random violence does not mean the city ``is out of control.''
   ``This is not Dodge City,'' he declared.
   Gunmen went to an apartment in the Bronx on Monday and fired
repeatedly through the door. ``Behind that door, Rayvon Jamison sat
in a child's walker and was struck by at least one of those
shots,'' said Police Commissioner Lee Brown.
   Brown said the three suspects under arrest were trying to gun
down the infant's uncle, Joseph Jamison.
   ``He was the object of the shooting. The child was the victim of
the senseless violence,'' said Brown.
   Jamison and eight others _ including the victim's mother and
grandmother _ were inside the apartment when the baby was shot.
   Jamison, 29, had chastised one of the suspects last Thursday for
a throwing a bottle, and animosity had escalated over the weekend,
Brown said.
   The petty nature of the dispute ``adds to the tragedy of this
shooting,'' Brown said. ``It also gives a clear message that the
value or the sanctity of life means little to someone who has easy
access to weapons.''
   ``No remorse was shown by the three men'' when they learned of
the child's death, said police Detective Ellen Hale.
   The suspects were charged with second-degree murder, criminal
possession of a deadly weapon, and reckless endangerment, Brown
said.
   The three previous slayings of children all occurred in the
borough of Brooklyn. Veronica Corales, 9, was killed while sleeping
in her parent's car; 3-year-old Ben Williams died in his sleep when
18 bullets were fired through the front door of his home; and
1-year-old Yaritimi Fruto was fatally wounded by a gunman who also
killed her father.
   The rash of killings has put Dinkins under pressure, and the
mayor reacted angrily to reporters who questioned his election-year
pledge to become the toughest mayor on crime in city history.
   ``There is law and order. Things are not out of control and this
is not Dodge City,'' said Dinkins. ``One cannot guard against the
kind of random violence that occurred when they shot in these doors
and took the lives of children.''
   Despite Dinkins' assertion, the city is on its way to a record
number of homicides for the third straight year. If projections
hold up, last year's all-time high of 1,905 murders will be
surpassed this year.
   The three under arrest were identified as Anthony Rupert, 18,
and two cousins, Thane Bobie West, 18, and Mike Solomon, 22.
