   An infant boy was killed by a stray bullet
Monday, just hours after mourners packed the funeral of a
9-year-old girl shot to death less than a week before.
   The 9-month-old baby, Rayvon Jamison, was shot after someone
pumped seven bullets through the door of the child's Bronx
apartment at 4:11 p.m., said Officer Fred Weiner, a police
spokesman.
   His death brings to four the number of children killed in New
York in a week by bullets apparently intended for others.
   He was sitting in a walker when he was struck twice by gunfire,
Weiner said. The child's mother, uncle and grandmother were in the
room at the time of the shooting, he added.
   Rayvon died a short time later at Lincoln Hospital.
   Police were investigating a possible dispute between the uncle
and another man as a motive in the shooting, but had made no
arrests.
   Mayor David Dinkins said the killing demonstrated the need for a
complete federal ban on assault weapons.
   ``Do we need further proof of what happens when we allow so many
people to be armed with so many guns firing so many bullets?''
Dinkins said. ``Our children are dying.''
   Yaritimi Fruto, 1, was killed last week in Brookly by gunmen who
also killed her father. Ben Williams, 3, was killed last week when
someone fired 18 shots through the door of his grandmother's
Brooklyn apartment while he slept on a fold-out couch.
   There have been no arrests in those shootings.
   Earlier in the day, about 250 people listened as pastor
Wengeslao Martinez of the Rock of Salvation Pentecostal Church in
Brooklyn, and his son, Samuel, recalled VeronicaCorales' enthusiasm.
   Samuel Martinez described Corales, as ``beautiful, sincere,
truthful, happy, cheerful and full of joy.''
   ``This is all the things she expressed and made us express back
to her,'' he said. ``Her love and joy is within our hearts.''
   Shortly after her funeral, an indictment charging Dorian
Daughtry with second-degree murder in her death. Daughtry, 22, is a
former minor-league baseball player.
   The girl was struck by a stray bullet July 22 as she slept in a
parked car in Brooklyn's East New York section. Her family had just
returned from a New Jersey amusement park and was dropping off
relatives.
   Police said Daughtry apparently was involved in a shootout with
at least one other person and the girl was struck with a bullet
from Daughtry's gun, which was not recovered.
   Daughtry joined the Seattle Mariners' Class A farm team, the
Bellingham, Wash., Mariners, in 1987. He played outfield and roomed
with Ken Griffey Jr., now a major league all star. Daughtry asked
to be released after the 1989 season.
