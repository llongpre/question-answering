<HEAD>Prosecutor: Landlords Not Criminally Liable in Deadly Fire</HEAD>

   Three landlords of a building that housed a
social club where 87 people were killed in a March arson fire are
not criminally liable for the blaze, a prosecutor has decided.
   Bronx District Attorney Robert T. Johnson made the announcement
Thursday after a hearing for Julio Gonzalez, who was charged with
178 counts of murder, arson and related crimes.
   During the court appearance before state Justice Burton B.
Roberts, Gonzalez's lawyer, Richard Berne, repeated his plan to use
the an insanity defense.
   Gonzalez was accused of splashing gasoline inside the club's
entrance March 25 before lighting it and causing the blaze.
   Immediately after the fire, much discussion focused on whether
the building's landlords could be charged in connection with the
fire.
   But Johnson said an extensive investigation had determined that
Alex DiLorenzo, whose corporation owned the property, and Jay Weiss
and Morris Jaffe, leaseholders and managing agents, were not
criminally liable.
   The prosecutor said defects and safety violations ``contributed
substantially'' to the harm caused by the fire.
   He said the three landlords took at least some steps ``however
ineffectually'' to try to fix the violations, including demanding
that the club be closed and attempting to evict the tenant who was
staging them.
   ``Thus, there is insufficient proof that their behavior rises to
the level of criminal conduct,'' he said.
