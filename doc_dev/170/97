   A city task force has closed 65 illegal social
clubs since last week, a crackdown spurred by an Aug. 21 fire in a
basement club in the Bronx that killed six people and injured more
than 30, city officials said.
   In the latest sweep, inspectors from the police, fire and
buildings departments issued 26 vacate orders during inspections of
the clubs late Saturday and early Sunday, said Detective Louis
Llanes, a police spokesman.
   Before Saturday night, inspectors had ordered 39 of the
gathering spots closed, at least until the violations are corrected.
   ``This is something the city will continue to monitor and go
after,'' said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for Mayor Edward I. Koch.
``This is not just hit and miss.''
