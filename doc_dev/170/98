   In an impassioned speech to a city divided by
racial conflicts, Mayor David Dinkins on Friday called on New
Yorkers to end the city's long history of ethnic conflict.
   ``This city is sick of violence and we're aching and we must
heal the pain,'' Dinkins said in the 27-minute speech broadcast by
several of the city's television and radio stations.
   Dinkins, under fire from the media and supporters, offered to
intervene personally in a confrontational, 4-month-long boycott by
blacks of two grocery stores owned by Korean-Americans.
   ``All of us want to live our lives in peace and dignity _ free
to walk any street and shop in any store, at any time, in any
neighborhood, without fear of force or violence,'' the city's first
black mayor told about 300 invited guests.
   ``We will never allow any group or any person to turn to
violence or the threat of violence to intimidate others no matter
how legitimate their anger or frustration may be,'' Dinkins said.
   He mentioned several racial conflicts, including the boycott in
Brooklyn. That controversy has spilled over into the courts, where
a judge chastised Dinkins for not intervening.
   Also, a brawl erupted last week at a Brooklyn college during a
speech by a professor who believes in white superiority. A Columbia
University sports banquet was disrupted by a soccer player's verbal
attack on gays and Jews. Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Jimmy
Breslin was suspended for two weeks by New York Newsday after
slurring an Asian-American co-worker.
   Guests at the speech _ including religious leaders, city
officials and representatives of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith _ listened as Dinkins spoke in City Council chambers.
   Dinkins noted that New York has many problems, including
expensive housing, crack, AIDS and a faltering economy.
   ``Unfortunately, some small-minded people prey upon these
pressures, spreading a message not of unity but of division,'' he
said. ``I challenge all of the people of this city to reject these
calls to bigotry.''
   Dinkins said blacks, Jews and immigrants from Ireland, Italy and
other countries faced violence as they arrived here. ``It's an old
story, a cycle of immigration and discrimination that's as old as
this city itself,'' he said.
   Dinkins outlined a plan to heal the racial divisions, including
formation of a bias strike force at the City Commission of Human
Rights and a study by the commission of discrimination in bank
lending practices.
   Hours before the speech, a black construction worker was beaten
with bats and billy clubs by as many as five white men in the
Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. The man was found wandering in
Bensonhurst about a mile away from the attack and was treated for
cuts and bruises, police spokesman Lt. Ray O'Donnell said.
   Police said they didn't know whether the beating was racially
motivated since the victim said no words were exchanged.
   In downtown Brooklyn, two juries deliberated for another day in
the case of two white teen-agers accused of murdering Yusuf
Hawkins, a black 16-year-old who came to their mostly white
Bensonhurst neighborhood to look at a used car.
   Outside the courthouse, 200 to 300 demonstrators and spectators
had gathered by mid-afternoon. Earlier, a small cluster of people
hung a banner reading, ``Civil rights or civil war.''
   Both juries recessed for the evening, and were to resume
deliberations Saturday.
   Emotions at the trial boiled over Wednesday when defense lawyer
Stephen Murphy was punched in the face by one of several hundred
demonstrators demanding murder convictions.
   Demonstrators tried to hit Murphy again Thursday, but he was
surrounded by police and apparently escaped injury.
   Murphy also represented a client in the Howard Beach case, the
last major trial that stirred tensions between blacks and whites in
the city.
   Dinkins, at his Jan. 1 inauguration, described the city as ``a
gorgeous mosaic'' of different nationalities, colors and sexual
preferences. In recent weeks, supporters and reporters harshly
questioned why he had not rallied to the defense of the mosaic.
   ``He believes in what he refers to as quiet diplomacy. He thinks
it will work. And I hope it will,'' said former Mayor Edward I.
Koch.
   But the Rev. Calvin Butts of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem
said, ``We don't need a quiet diplomat _ we need strong, forthright
leadership.''
