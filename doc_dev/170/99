Calling members of the Los Angeles City Fire Department "the toughest doormen 
in town," Fire Chief Donald O. Manning said Monday that the city is in no 
danger of a fire disaster like the one in New York over the weekend in which 87 
people died because of stiff regulations and constant inspections of all public 
places.

"It could happen here, but the likelihood is very, very slim," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some very effective tools in dealing with these problems."

The chief added that Los Angeles apparently has fewer illegal nightclubs than 
New York.

So far this year, the Los Angeles Fire Department has shut down 18 nightclubs 
for overcrowding -- four of which were operating illegally, Manning said. The 
last time a fire killed people at a local nightclub was in 1975, when five 
people were killed in a blaze at the Mecca Club in South Los Angeles, Manning 
said.
