   Namibian guerrilla chief Sam Nujoma
vowed Tuesday he would shortly return to his homeland, scene of the
bloodiest clashes between security forces and guerrillas in 23
years of war.
   His return would effectively end more than two decades as an
exile, wanted by the South African rulers of Namibia as a terrorist.
   But aides said it would not be his first visit home.
   ``He has been in and out with his men quite often,'' said one
official, who spoke on condition of not being identified.
   Nujoma addressed a news conference after he urged the U.N.
Security Council to immediately bolster its cease-fire monitoring
forces in Namibia.
   Asked if he would be going to Namibia, Nujoma replied, ``Yes,
very soon.''
   Nujoma reiterated denials that 1,200 of his men infiltrated
Namibia from Angola in violation of the cease-fire accord,
insisting ``our people have been fighting inside Namibia in the
past 20 years.''
   He said that in his 90-minute talks Tuesday with mission chiefs
of the five permament Security Council members _ America, the
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ he expressed ``utter
disgust over the killing of innocent Namibians, some of whom were
celebrating the start of the cease-fire.''
   A cease-fire is the initial stage of an independence transition
period for Namibia, a onetime German colony ruled for the last 74
years by South Africa.
   Nujoma, head of the South-West Africa People's Organization,
said he urged the Security Council through the envoys to stop the
South African-led security forces ``from butchering Namibians and
confine the South African army to their barracks.''
   He described as ``full-scale war'' the fighting that first broke
out last Saturday, the day the cease-fire was to go into effect.
   The combat has killed 169 of his fighters, 19 police and one
South African soldier.
   Meeting with Nujoma were U.S. Charge d'Affaires Ed Fugat, who
heads the U.S. Embassy while appointment of a new ambassador is
awaited; British High Commissioner (ambassador) Ramsay Melhuish;
and ambassadors Arrkadi Gloukhou of the Soviet Union, Song Ghoqing
of China and Pierre Garriague-Guyonnaud of France.
   Nujoma, who directs SWAPO from exile in the Angolan capital of
Luanda, is expected to discuss the crisis this week with leaders of
the so-called Front-line states _ black African nations that border
on South Africa or are particularly concerned with events there.
   That regional bloc _ Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe _ spearheads African efforts to end South
Africa's policy of apartheid, or racial segregation. Front-line
leaders often expressed fears Pretoria would try to sabotage moves
towards Namibian independence.
   Nujoma is in Harare for a three-day meeting on Namibia of 150
legislators from the Association of West European Parliamentarians
against Apartheid.
