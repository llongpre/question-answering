   Prince Charles donned a ``Life Begins
at 40'' button and poked fun at his eccentric image Monday as he
celebrated his birthday with 1,500 youths he has helped overcome
poverty and unemployment.
   ``You've given me one of the best birthday parties I could ever
have hoped for,'' the heir to the throne declared after a day that
included champagne toasts, birthday cakes, renditions of ``Happy
Birthday,'' and a princely bit of disco dancing with three of his
guests.
   A ball at Buckingham Palace for friends and family was scheduled
for the evening.
   Charles used his 40th birthday to launch an appeal for $70
million for the Prince's Youth Business Trust, a charity that gives
seed money and professional advice to unemployed people aged 18 to
25 who want to start their own business.
   He chose Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city, and spent the
day visiting projects partly financed by his various charities.
   He went to Handsworth, an inner city district torn by race riots
in 1985, to inspect Grove Lane Baths, which is being converted into
a community center.
   Then he continued to the Old Tram Depot, which has been made into
a transport museum. It was festooned with flags, balloons and
antique gaslamps. An old double-decker bus bore the number 40 and
the words ``Happy Birthday Prince Charles.''
   In the cavernous tram depot, the prince was serenaded by calypso
and rock bands, and by hundreds of young people singing a specially
composed paean to Charles: ``Thank you for showing where the road
can lead; If we put our mind to it, in time we will succeed.''
   His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is in good health at 62, and he
expects a long wait before being crowned King Charles III.
Meanwhile, his search for a meaningful role has transformed him into
a compelling spokesman for Britain's needy youth, and a critic of
environmental neglect.
   He also has a penchant for alternative medicine, vegetarianism,
talking to his plants and sojourning among the Bushmen of the
Kalahari Desert. He regards this simply as a measure of his
open-mindedness, and is known to be angry at the way some newspapers
here have exploited his foibles to question his sanity.
   His speech in Birmingham was a carefully crafted riposte,
frequently interrupted by laughter and cheers.
   ``Only the other day I was inquiring of an entire bed of
old-fashioned roses who were forced to listen to my dementing
ramblings on the meaning of the universe as I sat cross-legged in
the lotus position on the gravel path in front of me,'' he said.
   ``And I was inquiring of them what they thought would happen on
my birthday in a Birmingham tram shed. `A tram shed?' they all
replied, totally aghast at the thought. Yes, I said, a tram shed.
   ``At this point a row of prize Welsh leeks, cocky little things,
which were lurking in a nearby vegetable patch, chipped in to say
that they expected the shed would be filled with groups of
semi-naked Kalahari Bushmen ... and also a troupe or two of Tibetan
Buddhist monks ... armed with advance copies of the tabloid
newspapers which would be strewn in my path in a form of ancient
Buddhist greeting ...
   ``But looking around here, ladies and gentlemen, I see those
idiotic plants have got it wrong again. I knew they would. Instead,
you've given me one of the best birthday parties I could ever have
hoped for.''
   Gesturing to his lapel button, which he said was given to him by
his two small sons, he said, ``I'm not sure I ought to be reminded
of it, but my children reminded me of it just this day.''
   Of the charities he runs, he said: ``I never imagined for one
minute that they would become big enough to start giving expensive
birthday parties like this one. But it's all, I can assure you,
extremely rewarding and encouraging if you can see just one person's
life transformed by this means.''
