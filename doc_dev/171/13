FEATHER FALL: AN ANTHOLOGY by Laurens van der Post Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds
16.99, 269 pages
Sir Laurens van der Post is not so far short of 90 but, happily, in full
possession of his powers as he celebrates this 60th anniversary of his
association with the Hogarth Press (today subsumed in Chatto, and in turn in
Random House). This attendant anthology, Feather Fall, is a slightly curious
concept because one has to question its function. Is it to commemorate the
occasion? To remind us fans of his qualities? To give to new readers a taste
which will encourage them to buy the real books? Perhaps the model is the
anthology of CG Jung - van der Post's mentor - which has led many casual
readers to tackle Jung's fuller achievement.
After all, it is hard to imagine an anthology from, say, Conrad, or Bellow,
or Hemingway (successful publishing projects like The Essential Hemingway
are not comparable because they are omnibuses, not anthologies). The
explanation is that van der Post is seen today not so much as a novelist -
although he is a good one - but as a thinker, visionary, philosopher,
mystic. You cannot sensibly anthologise a novelist but you can much more
easily gather together a collection of extracts, often brief, even a single
paragraph, from the life-work of a sage.
The danger is that, as a result of abbreviation, you can finish up with too
many out-of-context mini-extracts which do less than justice to the author:
for instance, 'Never try to go ahead of your spoor. Many a man has died
because he has not observed the discipline of the spoor to the end'. That
sort of example, and there are quite a few of them here, would keep Private
Eye happy for months. As with all van der Post's regular appearances in that
journal, it is very unfair but undeniably funny.
Another problem with a book of this sort is that it cannot - because these
are snippets] - communicate the achievement of a creative writer. It needs
to be insisted that the early van der Post novels - In A Province, The Face
Beside The Fire, Flamingo Feather - are still splendid. The African travel
books - Venture to the Interior, The Lost World of the Kalahari, The Heart
of the Hunter - continue to defy the sneers of the anthropologists. A Story
Like The Wind and A Far-Off Place are a captivating duo about childhood and
much else. Even the food book, First Catch Your Eland, is hard to put down.
And that is to leave out The Dark Eye in Africa, The Seed and the Sower, the
travels to Russia and Japan, the recent semi-memoirs, and so much more.
The editors of Feather Fall, Jean-Marc Pottiez and Jane Bedford, focus on
van der Post not as novelist or traveller, soldier or crypto-diplomat, but
as - to use Rosamond Lehmann's words about him - 'a great spiritual thinker
and writer'. They correctly see 'a pattern in his writing, a flow and a
continuity' over 60 years, or at least over the 40 years since he resumed
his writing career after returning from the war in the Far East. That
pattern is underlined by the fact that he has never hesitated to repeat
himself: again and again his books, whether ostensibly fiction or
non-fiction, return to themes and episodes from his early Afrikaner
childhood, his Bushman nanny, his Huguenot ancestry, his early youthful
visit to Japan, his experiences as a POW, his subsequent travels in Africa,
his acquaintance with Jung, and so on.
Inevitably and properly, these topics are re-visited in this volume,
together with his lifelong meditation on the mighty themes that go with them
 -the dark shadow within ourselves, the function of journey for each of us,
the significance of the Bushman as the 'first man', the religious role of
Wilderness, the necessity to forgive, the Jungian sense of 'wholeness', the
mystery of Dream.
Too many of these extracts, in my opinion, are taken from that odd volume A
Walk with a White Bushman, which is not a real van der Post book but a
rambling and disorganised conversation with Jean-Marc Pottiez. I am also
struck by a change in style over the years: I am convinced that at some
point the taut, elegant pace of, say, Venture to the Interior, turned into
the very different rhythm, a tendency to spin words and lose precision, of
the later books. (I assume he started to dictate, which is never a good
thing.)
Van der Post has been active in Southern African affairs for many years
though he has chosen to operate sub rosa. His disdain for apartheid was
never a secret, nor - more controversially - his opposition to the
international sanctions which surely contributed to recent events. I
particularly enjoyed his unwitting reference here to the Afrikaners' history
'which still has a half-Nelson hold on them'. Fresh from a visit to
Johannesburg, and full of images of inauguration of majority rule, I was
also struck by his understanding - dating back to his years as prisoner of
the Japanese - of the surprising possibility of forgiveness.
'Persons who have really suffered at the hands of others do not find it
difficult to forgive, nor even to understand the people who caused their
suffering,' he once wrote. 'They do not find it difficult to forgive because
out of suffering and sorrow truly endured comes an instinctive sense of
privilege . . .' He went on, in a later novel, 'For if one does not forgive,
one does not understand, and if one does not understand, one is afraid, and
if one is afraid, one hates, and if one hates, one cannot love. And no new
beginning on earth is possible without love . . .'
I should like to think that those two elderly South Africans, Laurens van
der Post and Nelson Mandela, might have something to say to each other when
they are next in the same town.
