<LEADPARA>  SEVERAL HUNDRED feet below, a rust-colored scar cuts like a razor through the
glistening Okovanggo swamps. Willie Phillips taps a leathery finger on the
airplane window.;    "There's the new buffalo fence," the big-game hunter
said. "Come back here next spring, and you'll see dead animals all along it."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The fence runs along the northwest rim of the Okovanggo, an
8,500-square-mile wilderness teeming with game in northwest Botswana, where
the Okovanggo River makes a fan-shaped inland delta before dying in the sands
of the Kalahari Desert.;    Besides cutting migration routes for some of the
Okovanggo's rarest herds, the "buffalo fence" under construction also places
outside the fence one of the wildest and most remote sections of the delta,
the Magwegqana peninsula.;     'It's a paradise';    "It's a paradise, I'm
telling you, a paradise," Phillips said. "And it'll all be cattle country
now.";    The fence is the latest part of a long-range plan by the government
to cordon this sprawling, desert nation into cattle and wildlife zones.;   
The fences already have opened massive tracts of formerly wild country to
Botswana's cattle industry. They also have killed tens of thousands of wild
animals -- giraffe, springbok, zebra, eland -- that become tangled in the
sharp wires as they follow their centuries-old migrating routes. In the last
decade, Botswana's population of 300,000 wildebeest was reduced to a little
more than 1,000; they either died in the fences or of thirst in their
water-poor enclaves.;     Government defends fences;    Government officials
defend the program as necessary to Botswana's lucrative beef trade.
Environmentalists, they say, exaggerate the threat and underestimate the
ability of wildlife to adapt to the fences.;    Ove Nielsen, chairman of the
Botswana Meat Commission, complains that foreigners are trying to turn his
country into "a gigantic zoo.";    Botswana, long considered one of Africa's
most conservation-minded countries, recently has come under increasing attack
from international environmental groups -- partly because of the new fences
and partly for the proposed dredging of 15 miles of river leading out of the
swamps.;     Dredging draws attention;    The dredging, intended to tap the
delta's precious water, has drawn more international attention in recent
weeks. Greenpeace threatened to boycott Botswana's diamond industry if the
dredging isn't stopped. But many people think the buffalo fence poses the
greater threat.;    "As far as I'm concerned, this is worse than the
dredging," said one environmentalist in Gaborone, the capital.;    Coert Van
Hasselt, a lawyer based in Brussels, Belgium, represents a coalition of
environmental groups threatening to launch a global boycott of Botswana's beef
industry because of the fences.;    One concern is the timing of the
construction. Many of the Okovanggo's animals have left the swamp area to
migrate north toward the Angola highlands, where the rains begin in early
January. If the fence is finished in the next few months, environmentalists
argue, these animals will be caught outside.;     Delay promised;    In
response, the Botswana government promised only to plant the tall, wooden
posts for the fence, but to hold off stringing the steel wire until the rains
subside and the animals return to the central Okovanggo.;    But a Greenpeace
investigator said this month that an inspection showed that the wire was being
put in place and that the new fence's first casualty -- a young giraffe -- had
been found tangled and dead along one completed stretch.;    To
environmentalists, it is as though one of the world's greatest natural
treasures is being sacrificed for the benefit of a handful of major cattle
owners.;    To many Botswanans -- and to many landowners throughout Africa --
it is as though they are being asked to remain primitive and poor so
well-heeled foreigners will have a place to come on vacation.  </TEXT>
