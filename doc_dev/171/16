   Operation Desert Shield, along with
holding off Iraqi soldiers, is also shielding the desert from
another force that each year devastates Saudi rangeland: millions
of Iraqi sheep.
   An inadvertent side effect of impending war, conservationists
say, is that Iraqi herders have ceased their traditional migration
across the border to find pasture for sheep, goats and camels.
   That, they say, is no small windfall to Saudi Arabia, where a
loss of plant cover threatens to convert arable range into
wasteland across much of the country.
   ``Tanks and jeeps running around up there are nothing compared
to what happens from overgrazing,'' said Graham Child, senior
consultant to the National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and
Development.
   Crisis or not, the commission is pressing ahead with a 10-year
plan to protect endangered habitats and restock them with
disease-free gazelle, ostrich and native birds.
   The measures have already brought the Arabian oryx back from
extinction in the wild. Two species of gazelle are being bred by
the hundreds.
   There are also some new houbara bustards, large birds beloved by
Saudis who hunt them with falcons.
   Arabian rangelands, slowly degrading for a thousand years, now
suffer badly from Saudi Bedouin now able to use water trucks to
graze their animals on fragile land they could not reach before.
   Under historic accords, Iraqi and Jordanian nomads have crossed
regularly into northern Saudi Arabia to find fresh range. They have
benefited from the same generous subsidies allowed the Saudis.
   At the same time, swift rural development in Saudi Arabia
brought new roads, irrigated farming and other incursions on
natural habitats.
   Saudi leaders realized they faced a crisis in the mid-1980s when
hunters consistently camehome empty-handed. In 1986, the
commission was set up to do something about it.
   Within four years, 57,692 square miles were designated protected
areas. Specialists came in to shape a wildlife research center from
a neglected private zoo on the late King Khalid's farm north of
here.
   At a second center, scientists experimented with ways to breed
enough houbara bustard chicks to save the threatened wild
population.
   ``They've achieved an enormous amount in three years,'' said
Doug Williamson, an English-based biologist who runs the King
Khalid Wildlife Research Center.
   ``Things are far from perfect, but there is goodwill and money
is being committed,'' he said.
   Abdul Aziz abu Zinada, the commision's secretary-general, said
his priorities were protecting habitats, seeking environmental
legislation, restocking wildlife and building public awareness.
   Conflict with Iraq has stalled plans for regional cooperation,
he said, but international organizations have continued to help
with data and advice.
   ``Now in the north you can see idmi (sand gazelle) where they
had almost disappeared,'' Abu Zinada said. ``It is thrilling.''
   At the King Khalid Center, scientists have all but eliminated
the tuberculosis which, traced back to a gift deer from Spain, had
crippled herds left for years in a single enclosure.
   Soon the 600 to 700 gazelles now thriving as a result of the
program will be breeding hundreds of kids a year to be released
into the wild, Williamson said.
   The center has two pairs of afri, or Saudi dorcas gazelles,
among the last 27 believed left in the world.
   Altogether, there are 20 species from five continents.
   The animals thrive in separate pens and paddocks and include a
mix of indigenous species and gifts from visitors. There are idmi,
rheem (mountain gazelle), other rare gazelles, Arabian oryx,
zebras, ostriches and assorted extras, including a mad half-goat,
half-ibex that thinks it's a deer.
   Williamson, an antelope specialist who worked in Botswana's
Kalahari Desert, is also conducting research on how gazelle cope
with roasting desert temperatures.
   ``We haven't been affected much by the Iraq crisis,'' he said,
echoing remarks by scientists conducting other commission projects.
   ``There is a lot to do still, but we're doing it.''
