Dan Jacobson has taken time off from his crafted and distinguished novels to
go home - home to Kimberley, the diamond town, and thence to travel up the
'Missionary Road', that ancient African route which slips between the
Kalahari and the Boers and finishes at the Zambesi and the Victoria Falls.
It is not one of the region's finer scenic routes, featuring as it does
countless miles of thorn, sand and scrub, so Jacobson has to explain that he
was attracted to the journey in part by its historical interest, in part by
its personal reference - 'that half-known, half-feared region which had lain
forbiddingly on the very doorstep of the Africa I had grown up in'. We are
to be taken back, then, to the scene of his early - brilliant - novels,
before he graduated to a London professorial chair and ambitious novels on
Old Testament themes. The best thing in The Electronic Elephant is his
description of the Northern Cape veld, which sends us back after all these
years to A Dance in the Sun and its images of a furious Afrikaner isolation.
The route to the north was indeed important to the 19th-century
missionaries, who were in the vanguard of colonial conquest. 'The
Livingstone Liquor Stall' in Campbell, near Griquatown, is a reminder of the
presiding genius of the tale. It is a road, argues Jacobson, littered with
the wreckage of successive ideologies: European imperialism, Boer
nationalism, Victorian racialism, apartheid, African liberation, Marxism -
and Christianity, which alone has survived, and prospered, in its peculiar
African styles. In a lovely scene in the Kuruman mission church the
secular-Jewish Jacobson and his atheist wife are the only congregation at
the Easter service: 'Making sense of my presence there was impossible;
impossible also not to feel the strangest mixture of wonder, embarrassment,
mirth, fraudulence, compassion for our hosts, even a kind of protectiveness
towards them'.
This is, as you would expect, a journey informed by the novelist's eye. He
encounters Bushman soldiers brought back for their safety from Angola by the
South African Defence Forces whose forebears had massacred them to
near-extinction (it is, as he says, 'surreal'); he meets a group of
far-Right Afrikaners who are preparing for their own ethnic, on-screen
state; he returns, always, to the history of these obscure territories; he
notes that it was platinum as well as tourism which transformed the economy
of President Mangope's Bophuthatswana; he has the expatriate white South
African's gentle scepticism of the future ('A 'non-racial' South Africa? One
might as well talk of breeding a kosher pig . . .')
When he moves out of the Republic he is less confident: he does not respond
to Botswana and is ill at ease in Zimbabwe. The single map is inadequate,
the absence of an index is regrettable, and he can't spell Mmabatho.
Mark McCrum has published the story of another journey around Southern
Africa. The scheme is simple: McCrum spent time in Botswana as a teenager in
1977 and liked it; 15 years later he went back. Cue to a pleasantly readable
account of his travels and his undramatic adventures. McCrum has a good ear
for dialogue and does not take himself too seriously. Happy Sad Land makes
an interesting, relaxed, unessential read for anyone interested in that part
of the world. He can't spell Van Zyl Slabbert.
The best of the bunch, the surprise, the curiosity from out of the blue, the
classic-in-waiting, is Drury Pifer's Innocents in Africa. Pifer is an
American, a playwright who was brought up in Southern Africa in the 1930s as
son of a mining engineer who was employed on the Rand, in Kimberley, in
South-west Africa, and then in Kimberley again.
Pifer has produced an entrancing memoir of childhood in pre-apartheid days.
This book, written with superb precision and elegance, its recall of detail
based on access to his beloved mother's letters home, is utterly fascinating
about the South Africa of those pre-war years, yet it is more than this, it
evokes and recreates the intimacy of the life of a happy family of
half-a-century ago. The fact that they were Americans gives a unique view of
the English-Afrikaner tensions of those formative years, but the deeper
subject is its poetic recapture of the experiences of childhood which most
of us never recall in more than fragments.
The Pifers went back to America at the end of the war: 'It didn't occur to
us that this journey out of Africa was the last time we would find ourselves
together and happy, day after day, perfectly matched in our non-stop prattle
and familiar love . . .' The boy never went back.
Innocents in Africa deserves a much longer review: let this be a shorthand
recommendation of a wonderful book. He can't spell Japie.
