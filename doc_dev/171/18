THERE IS something about February that seems to induce in me a fit of
parsimony. This is not normally something that comes naturally, as my
husband is the first to rue, but I am taking a perverse kind of pleasure in
seeking out ways of spending less without having any less fun.
There are, of course, cycles in patterns of expenditure and few of us remain
unaffected by the moods that sweep our worlds.
What is interesting about the current cycle is while some are forced to cut
back for the saddest of reasons (unemployment, redundancy, rising costs)
others, whose incomes have not been affected one jot by the current economic
woes, also feel unaccountably constrained when it comes to consuming.
It is not quite done to go on spending in the old audacious ways. Cutting
back is seriously a la mode. Conspicuous Thrift is back in vogue.
Designer clothes are being tracked down at less than full retail price,
houses are being repainted and given a new lease of life with bargains from
markets and salerooms, upholstery and stencilling classes are there for the
taking, secondhand books are being sought, casseroles and pastas are turning
up on tables instead of foie gras and magret de canard. All it needs is
ingenuity, thought and style.
Here for those who feel hard-up and inclined to join the challenge are a few
suggestions for ways and means of cutting down without feeling deprived:
The ardent bookworm will have noticed that hardback books, once bought
lightheartedly, without thought for purse or pocket, have now become a
serious luxury.
Every town has its secondhand bookshop but in London the best, for serious
readers, is generally agreed to be Skoob, 15 Sicilian Avenue, Southampton
Row, London WC1. Mostly rather academically-inclined books but lots of
general interest, too.
Joining The London Library, 14 St. James's Square, London SW1 could also be
a good move - it would not take many books to recoup the Pounds 100 a year
fee. You can join almost instantly - just fill in the form and pay up.
Secondhand clothes are, of course, the cheapest, if not always the most
fashionable, way of dressing.
For chaps Bertie Wooster of 284 Fulham Road, London SW10, is a newcomer.
Here the would-be gentleman can kit himself out in authentic gear at a
fraction of the full retail price.
Everything is secondhand, all in what its owner calls 'really good nick.'
Dinner jackets can be bought for Pounds 75, morning coats and trousers from
Pounds 75 to Pounds 130 and bespoke, tailor-made suits for between Pounds 45
and Pounds 85. A pair of cords would be Pounds 25, tweed suits from Pounds
65 to Pounds 100.
There is many a chic woman who waits for the periodic peripatetic Designers'
Sale to bring her wardrobe up to date.
The next are not until June 5 - 7. Tel: 071-223-8004 for tickets when you
could put your summer wardrobe in order.
Do not forget the charity shops which seem to have become rather demode
recently.
I bought a ravishing silky ruffled blouse (ex-Saks 5th Avenue) at my local
branch for Pounds 3.60 which, though I say it myself, acquitted itself well
last week at a chic Parisian party.
For those who can dressmake or upholster or make their own curtains The
Cloth Shop, 290 Portobello road, Ladbroke Grove, London W10 (tel:
081-968-6001) is well worth knowing about.
Most fabrics are sold at half-price. There are wool suitings at Pounds 10 a
metre, old velvets from Pounds 1 to Pounds 12 a metre, as well as wonderful
collection of old English tie fabrics from the late 1950s.
Then there are designer fabrics from people such as John Galliano and
Arabella Pollen and at the moment a collection of Ralph Lauren blankets for
Pounds 80 (normally Pounds 300.)
When it comes to furnishing the home do not forget the markets - getting up
early on a Friday morning to go to Bermondsey, south London, trawling the
auction rooms and rooting around in the secondhand shops still provides the
best bargains and gives homes an interesting and eclectic air.
Eric Geen's Town &amp; Country Auctions in Britain, The Bargain Hunter's
handbook (published by the AA, Pounds 5.99) is still in print and is still
the best guide to salerooms all over the country.
The Java Cotton Company, 52 Lonsdale Road, London W11 5BY (some of its wares
are photographed top right) sells ravishing hand-drawn and hand-block batik,
all made by traditional Javanese methods.
Anyone who has already come across batik will know what truly lovely effects
it produces, anyone who does not should hurry along to take a look. Besides
selling the handblocked cottons by the metre (Pounds 14.75), it also has a
range of accessories made from the fabric - table napkins (Pounds 2.25),
cushions (Pounds 18.75) and tablecloths (from Pounds 38).
Ian Mankin, of 109 Regent's Park Road, London, MW1 8UT, has long been a
source of sturdy inexpensive fabrics - all those lovely old-fashioned things
such as mattress ticking (Pounds 4.75 a metre), striped muslin (Pounds 4.50
a metre), calico (Pounds 2.00) cricket stripes (Pounds 5.80) and cotton net
(Pounds 1.25).
Now he has opened another branch south of the Park at 271, Wandsworth Bridge
Road, London SW6 2TX. Look out also for double width linen by the metre,
wide enough for a 5 ft 6 ins bed, at Pounds 29.80 which means you could make
a pair for Pounds 165 instead of paying the Pounds 235 that currently the
lowest priced ready-made version costs.
Anthony Thompson currently has some marvellous rugs, carpets, shawls,
needlepoint and textiles on sale at very special prices. The market has been
seriously depressed all year and if you go along to his shop at 5, Hillgate
Street, London W8 7 SP you will find early 20th century needlework chair
covers from Pounds 20, rugs from Pounds 50 and lots of other bargains
besides.
Then there is our old friend the Next Directory - I cannot recommend highly
enough the new spring version. It is beautifully photographed and filled
with highly desirable clothes and household goods, from simple shorts and
trousers, sweaters, the best T-shirts I have yet seen  - generous sleeves
with dropped shoulders, good necklines in marled blue, grey or cream for
Pounds 12.99 - to an excellent range of household basics.
Look for 100 per cent cotton percale bedding at Pounds 19.99 for a single
sheet, chambray bed linen at Pounds 29.99 for a single duvet cover and plain
ridged glass bowls (photographed below) at Pounds 16.99 for four. Well worth
sending for. For the catalogue (Pounds 1) tel: 0345-100-500.
And now, having saved all that money, what about a treat?
Hartley Safaris have, at the request of four Weekend FT readers who came
with us to the Kalahari and the Okavango delta two years ago, put together a
very special trip to the remote Kalahari Gemsbok Park, the Etosha pan, the
Skeleton coast and the Namib desert.
It will be a privileged group of just ten readers and some smashing guides -
eight places are booked, only two places, which will go to the first takers,
are left.
It runs from April 24 - May 8 and costs Pounds 4,579 each. Full itineraries
available from Hartley's Safaris, 12 Queensberry Mews West, London SW7 2DXU.
Tel: 071-584-5005.
