   A pregnant woman, her husband and their
2-year-old son were rescued after being stranded in the Kalahari
Desert for nine days, a relative said Tuesday.
   Jonathan Hayman, his wife, Laura, and their son, Romano, were
driving across the Central Kalahari Game Reserve on Feb. 23 when
their truck broke down, said Lawrence Wright, a cousin of Hayman.
   After three days, the Botswana family ran out of food and water
and began walking back toward their hometown of Serowe, more than
120 miles away, Wright said.
   The mother and child were too weak to continue after three days,
but Hayman, 24, continued and was found by farm workers Saturday.
   A Botswana Defense Force helicopter located Mrs. Hayman and her
son, Wright said.
   ``I had given up hope,'' said Mrs. Hayman, 23. ``I thought we
were both dead.''
   She said she and her son survived by sucking the moisture off
plants during the night. Daytime temperatures in the Kalahari Desert
often reach above 100 degrees time of year.
