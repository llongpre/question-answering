I THOUGHT I had hung up my (professional) safari hat. With small groups of
FT readers I have canoed down the Zambezi, camped in the innermost reaches
of the Kalahari, walked through swamps in Botswana, looked for Bushman
paintings in the Tsodilo hills, skirted hippos in the Okavango Delta,
watched the eagles fly and the lion hunt . . . happy, happy days in the
company of lots of smashing readers.
That Africa could still have further delights to offer seemed unimaginable.
But that was before I met Iain and Oria Douglas-Hamilton.
Anybody who knows anything about Africa knows that there is scarcely another
soul who knows as much about elephants, who has spent as many hours right in
among them, as Iain and Oria. Ever since Iain went out to Africa as a young
Oxford zoology graduate to complete his Ph. D thesis on elephant behaviour,
and met Oria at a party in Nairobi, elephants have been their lives. They
have studied them on the shores of Lake Manyara, charted their falling
numbers up and down the width and length of Africa, fought for them, lobbied
for them and written about them. 'Nobody,' said Desmond Morris recently,
'has done more for elephants than the Douglas-Hamiltons.'
So a chance to go in among the elephants with Iain and Oria as our guides
seemed special enough to make me look to my safari hat. This will be the
first time the Douglas-Hamiltons have taken a group on this kind of safari.
There are places for just 16 people in all. The Douglas-Hamiltons will
accompany the group from beginning to end. They will take you among the
groups of elephants they have got to know so well in Lake Manyara, in Tsavo
East National Park and along the Tarangire River where in September (the
time of our safari) huge herds gather to drink among the baobab trees.
You will stay in private camps, most of them set up specially for the group
in areas where the game viewing is best or where the herds are known to be
gathering. There will be picnic lunches in the bush, evening meals on the
banks of rivers, nights spent with nothing but slivers of canvas between you
and the African darkness.
Iain and Oria, however, will not be the only experts. After seven days the
group flies (with the Douglas-Hamiltons as well) to the ottoman-style camp
of Roland Purcell in the Mahale Mountains on the eastern shores of Lake
Tanganyika. Here among the palm-nut vultures, the fish eagles, the goliath
herons you will stay for three nights, with Roland on hand to illuminate the
experience. Roland is to chimps what the Douglas-Hamiltons are to elephants.
He has studied them, knows their families, has given them names and is a
world-renowned expert on primate behaviour. There, in the tropical
rainforest, is the largest known group of chimpanzees in the world, some 100
strong, which Roland will take you to.
From the Mahale Mountains another private charter flight takes you to your
own camp in a private part of the Masai Mara Reserve to search for the
wildebeest migration, one of the great sights of Africa.
The trip ends with three days in the Douglas-Hamiltons' own home on the
shores of Lake Naivasha with more local treats such as lunch among the
flamingoes of Lake Nakuru and a flight round Mount Kenya (designed to make
sure you come back to climb it).
The safari starts at Heathrow on Friday, September 3 and finishes back at
Heathrow on Monday, September 20. It has been orchestrated by African
Explorations of Holwell Manor Barn, Holwell, Burford, Oxon OX18 4JS.
At Pounds 5,499 per person it is not cheap - (time perhaps to say sod the
recession?) - but I believe that what you will be getting is unbeatable:
world authorities on elephants and chimpanzees, private camps in secluded
parts of the bush and private charter flights from one area to another.
Anybody wanting more information and a detailed itinerary should write to me
at The Financial Times, No 1 Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL, marking the
envelope 'Safari'. To book a guaranteed place a deposit of Pounds 1,000 will
be required (non-returnable except in cases covered by holiday insurance).
It should be made payable to Africa Explorations but sent to me.
As I have learnt from past experience that readers in far-flung parts feel
rather disadvantaged by distance and postal services, I will allow a full
fortnight for letters to arrive and itineraries to be sent out. After that
it will be first come, first served.
'Even today, to visit Africa is a feast for the senses,' says Bartle Bull in
his splendid tome on the history of the safari. I believe he is right. We
cannot know what Africa must have looked like to those first explorers a
century and a half ago but I do know that conservation policies are
beginning to show some results. Iain Douglas-Hamilton tells me the elephant
herds in Kenya are healthier and more numerous than they were ten years ago.
Everywhere a sense of the treasures that we so nearly lost - and might yet
lose - has brought a heightened sense of care and awareness. At present we
are lucky. The Africa we yearn for is still there to be discovered.
