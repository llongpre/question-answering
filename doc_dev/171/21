<HEAD>African Elephant Population Declined By One-Third From 1981-7</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Widespread poaching has reduced the
African elephant population by more than one-third during the
1980s, from 1.2 million to less than 800,000, a conservation group
said.
   The Kalahari Conservation Society said in its monthly newletter
that Botswana was the only African country to report a substantial
increase in its elephant population during from 1981 to 1987.
   The number of elephants in Botswana rose from 20,000 to 51,000
during the seven years, the newsletter said.
   Overall, the African elephant population fell from 1.2 million
in 1981 to 764,000 by 1987, the group said. The decline was
attributed almost completely to the poaching of elephants for their
valuable ivory tusks, the newsletter said.
   The Botswana-based conservation society said the figures came
from the African Elephant Conservation Coordinating Group, which
was assisted by the Swiss-based Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species.
