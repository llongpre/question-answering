<F P=106> [Interview with President Sam Nujoma by Veronique Kiesel in </F>
Brussels; date not given: "On Namibia and the President's Visit 
to Belgium"] 
  [Text] [Kiesel] Four years ago, Namibia gained independence 
and, after winning the elections, you became its first 
president. What has changed in your country since then? 
  [Nujoma] The Namibians are free, masters of their fate. They 
make their own decisions, through the process of parliamentary 
democracy. Human rights are respected, as is press freedom and 
freedom of speech, which are protected by law. Before that, 
people were separated according to their color, their ethnic 
origin. Today, Namibian children go to school together, all are 
citizens of the same country. We have striven to establish 
peace and stability, which are vital to economic development. 
  [Kiesel] Your government program includes an agrarian 
reform, 
the redistribution of land to peasants who were deprived of it. 
Is this reform not likely to disrupt the good relations which 
you have succeeded in maintaining with the white minority in 
your country? 
  [Nujoma] Namibia was colonized first by the Germans, and 80 
percent of arable land is in the hands of the Whites. Now that 
apartheid no longer exists, and that all Namibians are equal 
citizens, we need land for some people, but we believe in the 
virtues of dialogue. The land problem was discussed at the 1991 
National Conference, with all the interlocutors, including the 
Whites. A technical committee then sent a report to the 
government and to Parliament. Of course, there are some Whites 
who do not want to share, who support the status quo, but the 
Constitution guarantees everybody's rights, and we want to 
ensure that every Namibian can own land. This is a big country, 
and there is a political will to achieve justice and a decent 
life for all. I therefore think we will manage to overcome this 
problem. 
  [Kiesel] Your big South African neighbor has just changed 
its 
face with Nelson Mandela's victory. What wishes do you have for 
the new South Africa and what are your hopes for Namibia and the 
rest of the region? 
  [Nujoma] As citizens, we welcome the new democratic and 
nonracial South Africa. We hope that there will be no more 
explosions of violence as there were before the elections, but 
that instead all South Africans will set to work for the common 
good. 
  As for our relations with our big neighbor, we hope that by 
joining the various regional organizations, and with its high 
economic standard, it will contribute to the welfare of the 
whole of southern Africa, and even the whole continent. At 
present, our economy is highly dependent on South Africa's 
economy, because of our historical ties. I think that this can 
be used in a positive way, now that apartheid is a thing of the 
past. Together we can be stronger faced with competition from 
the rest of the world. Let us follow the example of the 
European Union (EU), we should succeed in creating an African 
economic community. 
  [Kiesel] Just a few years ago, you were regarded as a 
Marxist 
guerrilla and now you are developing a free trade economic 
policy. How do you explain this change? 
  [Nujoma] I have been called all kinds of names: I was a 
terrorist, a Communist. In fact, I was primarily a Namibian, a 
member of the international community, who was fighting for his 
country's independence against the occupying forces. Today, our 
enemies have changed: They are called poverty, ignorance, and 
disease, and we must fight them. Our country has many 
resources: Uranium, copper, gold, and other metals, but we need 
education to be able to really exploit this wealth. That is why 
we opened a university last year, and why we are building many 
schools and hospitals. This improvement in our society is vital. 
  [Kiesel] Since the beginning of last year, the port of 
Walvis Bay, which was always occupied by South Africa, has been 
returned to Namibia. What are your plans on this subject? 
  [Nujoma] As you know, Namibia occupies a strategic position 
in this part of Africa. It provides access to the ocean for 
enclaved countries like Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana, 
especially in view of the fact that we are working on big 
highways, like the trans-Kalahari Highway. Walvis Bay is 
already one of the most efficient ports in the whole of Africa, 
and, by railroad, it is even linked with Kenya. The more 
transport routes there are, the more we will be able to develop 
trade and business, inside the continent itself. 
  [Kiesel] With regard to the development of the port, you are 
in contact with Antwerp. 
  [Nujoma] Indeed, we went to visit the port of Antwerp on 
Wednesday morning [18 May] and we have been very impressed by 
the organization of labor. Moreover, we are very interested in 
an agreement which would enable us to improve the training of 
Namibians in this sphere. The Belgian Government has promised 
us the necessary funds for a training program of this kind. 
  [Kiesel] Aside from this cooperation agreement, what are the 
aims of your visit to Belgium? 
  [Nujoma] Namibia is a product of the international 
community. 
My colleagues and I have all experienced exile, especially in 
Belgium, which is rather like our second home: Two SWAPO 
[South- west African People's Organization] conferences were 
held there in 1972 and 1986. From our early days, we were 
supported here in Belgium by antiapartheid organizations and by 
trade unions, then by the government. We have very good 
friends, and this visit is an opportunity to revive the 
excellent relations between our two countries. Just after our 
independence, to express our gratitude, I invited King Baudouin 
to Namibia. He accepted, but unfortunately did not have time to 
come to see us. Moreover, we came here with proposals for 
commercial agreements, and plans for joint-ventures between 
private enterprises. 
  [Kiesel] What about the European aspect of your visit to 
Brussels? 
  [Nujoma] From before we gained our independence, the 
European 
Community gave us its support, and it continued afterwards, 
especially through aid for training. The EU therefore plays a 
vital role with regard to us, and we want to continue these 
relations in the most beneficial way.
