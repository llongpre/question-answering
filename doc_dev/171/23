The Pompidou Center in Paris ranks as that nation's top draw, attracting more 
than 8 million visitors in 1988, according to the French Government Tourist 
Office. The center contains, among other things, the National Museum of Modern 
Art. Ranked second with 4.5 million visitors was the Eiffel Tower, just ahead 
of the City of Science and Industry at La Vilette. Versailles was fourth and 
the Louvre fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Paris, France's most popular attractions were the 16th-Century Chateau 
de Chenonceaux in the Loire Valley and Mont St. Michel in Normandy.

</P>
<P>
"We are a peaceful country and we are committed to maintaining the peace so 
that tourists coming to our country can feel protected," Moi said in ordering

In an effort to preserve the environment, especially within its national parks 
and reserves, the government of Botswana has dramatically raised user fees for 
unescorted visitors to the parks. The per-person fees have increased from $1.50 
a day to $25, plus $10 a night for camp fees and a $5-per-day vehicle charge. 
</P>
<P>
The move is an attempt to encourage travelers to take tours that use 
established campgrounds and lodges, and to discourage the independent travelers 
-- mostly from neighboring South Africa. Those on escorted tours using a 
licensed operator will be charged a flat $15 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Botswana government believes unescorted travelers to such regions as the 
Okavango Delta and Kalahari Desert are far less responsible to the environment 
than tourists who are under the supervision of a trained guide or park ranger.
