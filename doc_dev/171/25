<LEADPARA>  THE hardest part about planning a trip to Zimbabwe is the inflexibility of
most tour companies -- and trying to find a knowledgeable operator whose base
is not South Africa.;    Because Zimbabwe is still an obscure destination for
Americans, most U.S. "adventure travel" specialists offer only a few trips a
year, and these are often part of a larger itinerary. One New York-based
outfit, however, specializes in Zimbabwe trips: African Wildlife and Travel,
run by a Zimbabwean named Andrew Graham. Graham is highly informative, knows
many out-of-the-way spots, and puts together personalized itineraries at a
price of $150-$200 a day, plus air fare (around $1,400).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Other safari outfits that run organized tours to Zimbabwe include Overseas
Adventure Travel, Abercrombie &amp; Kent, Safari World, Game Trackers and Fun
Safaris in Bloomingdale, Ill.;    (check) WHEN TO GO -- The best time to
travel is the dry season, which runs from May through October.;    (check)
WHERE TO GO -- Although Zimbabwe's capital Harare is usually the gateway to
the safari belt, Graham routed me through Lusaka, Zambia, a two-hour drive by
taxi to the Zimbabwean border town of Kariba. The huge Kariba dam wall plugs
up the Zambezi River and forms the crossing point between Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Kariba is the starting point for excursions east to Mana Pools park and the
Zambezi River or west to the lodges and houseboats of Lake Kariba. Comfortable
hotels are plentiful, including the Lake View Inn and the Carribea Bay
Resort.;    (box) River Safaris: Several outfits based in Kariba offer three-
to seven-day canoe trips down the Zambezi. Hans Van Der Heiden runs Buffalo
Safaris, providing all equipment on river safaris, including tents and
sleeping sacks. Van Der Heiden also owns a houseboat on the edge of Matusadona
National Park on Lake Kariba; other isolated resorts dot the lake's south
shore, including those on Fothergill Island and Spurwing Island, and in Bumi
Hills. Activities include walking safaris in the bush, casting for tiger fish
and canoeing.;    (box) Hwange National Park: Probably the best reserve in
Africa for elephant viewing, it lies on the high Kalahari Desert plain 500
miles west of Kariba. The only way to travel is via Air Zimbabwe, which,
barring the occasional strike, runs on schedule. Several luxurious hotels sit
on the park's outskirts, including the intimate, $180-a-night Ivory Lodge
(eight thatched-roof bungalows and a private water hole for animals) and the
Hwange Safari Lodge. Both offer morning and afternoon drives through the
park's northern section. For a wilder adventure, contact Chris Van Wyk either
through Andrew Graham or directly (telex 51635 in Zimbabwe. Answer back: NEMBA
ZW).;    (box) Victoria Falls: The grand finale of my trip, it is a 20-minute
flight north from Hwange. There are a dozen hotels in town, but the only place
to stay is the Victoria Falls Hotel, built at the turn of the century for
railroad executives. The elegant, slightly seedy colonial structure offers a
touristy "African Dance Spectacular" every night, followed by a buffet dinner
and a marimba band. Don't miss breakfast on the veranda, with the falls
roaring a half-mile away. I avoided Harare, Zimbabwe's pleasant-if-bland
capital. If you stay, the two best hotels in town are the colonial-era Meikles
and the giant, five-star Monomatapa.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Contact
