   In his search for an escape from the frustration of
playing monarch-in-waiting, Prince Charles is carving out a niche as
an improbable but often effective ``Voice of the People.''
   His sorties into issues like ocean pollution, unemployment and
inner city decay bring him about as close to political controversy
as the strictly neutral British monarchy can go. By stretching the
bars of his gilded cage, this child of privilege faces the irony of
becoming a darling of the left, monarchy's traditional foe.
   Charles Philip Arthur George turns 40 on Nov. 14, and the Bonnie
Prince Charlie of younger days has grown more somber, the sense of
guilt at all his privileges more apparent.
   There's still a lot of the fun-loving jetsetter left in him, but
the solemn face looks more lined and lived-in. The pate that will
one day wear the crown is balding. His taste in clothes runs to
conservative double-breasted suits. If he owns a pair of jeans, no
one in the outside world has seen him in them.
   Moving among his fellow citizens _ particularly the young, urban
unemployed who are his biggest concern _ he takes on what a
biographer, Alan Hamilton, calls ``the faintly puzzled air of a
bishop in a betting shop.''
   At times, the heir to the throne could pass for just another
1960s survivor coasting into middle age: married with two small
kids, he's into organic farming, alternative medicine, health food,
Jungian philosophy and the fate of ozone layer.
   What lifts him above the ordinary is that as Prince of Wales,
Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of
Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Great Steward of
Scotland, his destiny is to become King Charles III.
   That destiny looks far off. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is
healthy and vigorous at 62, and shows no inclination to abdicate in
favor of her son.
   Meanwhile, perhaps mindful of an earlier Prince of Wales who
frittered away 59 years waiting to be crowned King Edward VII, the
prince has made it clear that ``I am determined not to be confined
to cutting ribbons.''
   Charles' story, writes another biographer, Anthony Holden, ``is
one of constant struggle against the limitations placed upon him by
the genetic accident of his birth ... a confused and tortured soul
trying to come to terms with a claustrophobic, if comfortable life
of inherited imprisonment ... a caring and thoughtful man in search
of good to do.''
   That search has taken him on clandestine visits to London slums,
into the cowsheds of his tenant farmers, to the peatlands of the
Western Isles of Scotland and as far afield as the Kalahari Desert
in southern Africa's Botswana.
   His attempts to articulate what he has learned have suffered from
clumsiness, but as his themes become more polished, they tell as
much about his own state of mind as they do about the state of
Britain.
   Simply put, Charles stands for consensus in a society divided by
the uncompromising anti-consensus politics of Margaret Thatcher.
   Where the Conservative prime minister is embarked on a capitalist
revolution designed to create what she calls ``a go-getter
society,'' Charles gives voice to the fears of the losers in this
race for a leaner, tougher Britain.
   The problem for Charles is that when the issues are so
all-embracing, and consensus is a dirty word in Mrs. Thatcher's
book, just being neutral can seem like taking sides.
   ``We're in for a period of eight, 10, perhaps 20 years of
Conservative government, and therefore any criticism of the world as
it is sounds like a criticism of the government,'' says Norman
Tebbit, a former Conservative Party chairman.
   Thus when Charles attacks North Sea pollution, it is widely seen
as an attack on Mrs. Thatcher's government as insensitive to the
environment.
   When he decries unemployment, Thatcherites bristle at a perceived
criticism of the prime minister for having caused the unemployment.
If Charles laments poverty, the implication, intended or not, is
that Mrs. Thatcher doesn't care about the poor.
   Says biographer Hamilton: ``Mrs. Thatcher believes in the
meritocracy, and an individual in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain is all
right provided he can make it on his own. ... Mrs. Thatcher does not
sympathize with the underprivileged. Charles does.''
