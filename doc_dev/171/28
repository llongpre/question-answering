<LEADPARA>  SOMETIME in the dark past, an unknown race migrated to this hidden valley and
built a civilization amid the palms and the crocodiles. They designed exotic
buildings with towers and domes, erected rain-forest temples where they
worshiped monkeys, and, at the center of it all, built a lakeside palace
rising out of the mist.;   Then, the culture mysteriously collapsed,
languishing for 500 years until it was recently rediscovered in the arid
escarpment between Johannesburg and the Kalahari Desert.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Nice story. Indiana Jones and the Lost City of the Monkey Gods. Too bad
it's not true.;   Bulldozers rumble along mud-rutted paths on the desolate
hillside here, kicking up dust and gravel, while an army of workers hauls
bricks and girders into the massive work site.;   When it is completed late
next year, the Lost City development -- located in the nominally independent
South African homeland of Bophuthatswana -- will be the largest and most
lavish attempt in southern Africa to separate international tourists from
their travel dollars. It features an artificial jungle, massive luxury hotel
and its own concocted history.;   ALL OVER southern Africa, tour agents,
hoteliers and safari operators are gearing up for what they hope will be a
boom in South African tourism -- once the country gets its political problems
sorted out, of course.;   Just this month, South Africa began negotiations to
expand its 8,000-square-mile Kruger National Game Park by annexing 2,000
square miles of an adjacent game refuge in neighboring, war-torn Mozambique.; 
 Three hotels are on the drawing boards in Johannesburg's northern suburbs
alone, with others planned for Cape Town, Durban and various mountain, desert
and wildlife vacation areas.;   "Sanctions and violence have made it difficult
to attract foreign visitors all these years," said Barry Hurter, director of
marketing for Lost City's parent company. "People would come here, say how
wonderful everything was, then go home and not tell their neighbors where they
went.";   The hope is that now, with President F.W. de Klerk, African National
Congress President Nelson Mandela and other political leaders beginning talks
to transform South Africa into a non-racial democracy, passions will cool and
foreign tourists will arrive in larger numbers.;   In 1984, a record 792,387
foreigners visited South Africa. Tourism plummeted by more than a third in
subsequent years as economic boycotts took their toll and the state airline
was prohibited from flying into many countries, including the United States.; 
 But in 1990, the year Mandela was released from prison and de Klerk began
dismantling apartheid, 1.03 million foreigners -- a new record -- visited
South Africa.;   Most of last year's rise came in visitors from elsewhere in
Africa, as numerous states relaxed sanctions.;   But the tourists Geyer
expects in the coming decade will be from elsewhere, with the biggest
potential growth areas being Japan and the United States.;   In 1984, 70,502
U.S. citizens visited South Africa. Last year, 47,425 came, a drop of almost a
third -- and 60 percent of those came only to visit friends and relatives.;  
Geyer blames the drop on the political boycott, which made it morally
unacceptable to spend tourist dollars in the apartheid state, and the end of
direct flights between New York and Johannesburg.;   FLIGHTS to New York are
set to resume this year. But there are still hurdles. The political situation,
for instance, is far from settled. Violence still erupts in the townships, and
the negotiations for a new constitution have not even begun. And the ANC still
disapproves of foreign tourists coming to South Africa, arguing that they
should wait until the country reforms itself before pumping money into it.;  
A skeleton of girders and brick rises above the bare hillside on the Lost City
site. More than 5,000 workers clamber along scaffolding or laboriously cart
palms and bamboo to transplant sites.;   The $300 million Lost City is a kind
of pre-colonial fairy tale of exotic old Africa, a Third World whimsy, for
travelers who want the jungle and the mist and eerie pagan religions without
giving up air conditioning, marble bathrooms and Italian food -- and without
the guilt of staying in decaying colonial hotels surrounded by shantytowns.;  
There will be 64 acres of manufactured jungle, including 7,000 trees festooned
with 30,000 hanging orchids, a 350-room luxury hotel made to look like an
ancient palace, a gigantic wave pool capable of stirring 6-foot swells,
crocodiles and hippos, thousands of birds, four water-slides and dozens of
assorted "ruins" framed by the picturesque primordial foliage.;   At various
points, hidden mist machines will give the look and feel of a tropical rain
forest to what is actually an artificial garden in the dry air of the desert's
edge ("built on the vestiges of an ancient, imaginary lake," a promotional
film proclaims).  </TEXT>
