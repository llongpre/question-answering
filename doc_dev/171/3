   In the golden glow of the Kalahari
Desert, the Bushmen live in nomadic simplicity virtually unchanged
for thousands of years.
   At the seaside resort of Swakopmund, descendants of German
settlers converse in their mother tongue over wiener schnitzel and
beer at sidewalk cafes.
   In the dusty town of Rehoboth, virtually all 20,000 residents
are of mixed-race and insist on being called ``Bastards.''
   Namibia's vast, rugged landscape has only 1.3 million people,
but they make up an anthropological laboratory of 11 ethnic groups
who often put tribe before country and are linked not by culture
nor tradition.
   With independence from South Africa expected early next year,
Namibians still are searching for a sense of nationhood to bond
people who share little but common boundaries.
   Witchcraft cases are tried under a Western legal system.
Mercedes-Benzes and donkey-drawn carts kick up dust along the same
rural roads. Black women with a week's worth of groceries perched
on their heads shop alongside white women in fur coats in this
modern capital.
   At political rallies arranged by the South-West Africa People's
Organization, the faction favored to win November's
pre-independence elections, speeches are delivered in English, then
translated into four African languages.
   ``Namibia is not a nation at this point,'' said Hans Diergaardt,
leader of the Rehoboth Basters. ``There are too many different
groups that have been kept apart for too long.''
   Diergaardt and his fellow Basters, the Afrikaans-language word
for ``bastards,'' epitomize the stubborn independence that
permeates Namibia's multi-tribal society.
   The product of liaisons between whites and blacks in South
Africa's Cape Province, the Basters left that region in search of
farmland and independence in 1868 and settled the deserted
missionary village of Rehoboth, about 60 miles south of Windhoek.
   They identify with neither whites nor blacks and have
steadfastly refused to recognize the authority of the German
colonialists or their South African successors.
   They now oppose Namibia's planned one-person, one-vote elections.
   ``A unitary state in Namibia is not going to work,'' said
Diergaardt, a husky farmer whose weathered face speaks of years
spent in the African sun.
   Diergaardt has threatened to unilaterally declare Rehoboth an
independent state if the Basters are dissatisfied with Namibia's
elected government.
   For the past several years the Basters have prepared for such a
move by purchasing land that separates their territory from
Atlantic port of Walvis Bay, about 180 miles away. They've bought
250,000 acres and need about $5 million to secure enough land for a
corridor to the sea, Diergaardt said.
   Like the Basters, the diminutive Bushmen have found little in
common with other Namibians.
   Entirely self-sufficient, the Bushmen thrive in the seemingly
inhospitable Kalahari with extraordinary hunting and gathering
skills.
   They are among the most primitive people on earth, rarely
building fixed settlements or making regular contact with other
groups.
   Most of Namibia's 30,000 Bushmen have begun to join the modern
world, including hundreds employed by the South African-led
security forces as trackers in the 23-year-old bush war against
SWAPO guerrillas.
   Equally untouched by Western culture are the Himbas of Namibia's
barren northwest corner, who wear minimal clothing and smear their
bodies with a rancid mixture of butter and ochre that gives them a
distinctive orange tint.
   The Himbas have repeatedly rejected Western missionaries, while
their cousins, the Hereros, accepted them to such an extent that
the women still dress in brightly colored 19th-century Victorian
dresses that seem incongruous in Namibia's scorching climate.
   Most of the original missionaries and settlers were Germans,
whose influence remains strong.
   The Atlantic town of Swakopmund features turn-of-the-century
German architecture set against the alien terrain of the Namib
Desert. Visitors are more likely to be greeted in German than the
official languages of English and Afrikaans.
   German descendents, who account for about 20,000 of Namibia's
75,000 whites, are prominent in business throughout the territory,
but generally stay out of Namibia's tangled politics, which until
recently included 47 parties.
   Far from Swakopmund's European charm, the Kavango people of
northeastern Namibia remain wedded to tribal customs.
   In one case, a suspected Kavango arsonist received the
traditional punishment from his tribal elders _ he was ordered to
dig his own grave then lie in it, where he was buried alive,
according to court records.
   Three tribal elders were convicted of the killing, but received
only suspended sentences.
   Suspected witches have been thrown into rivers with stones tied
around their necks. If they drown, it is considered proof they were
witches; if they survive, then they were falsely accused, according
to tradition.
   Namibia abandoned most of its segregation laws in the late
1970's and early 1980's, and the racial climate is more relaxed
than in neighboring South Africa.
   But under South Africa rule, Namibia's tribal differences were
formalized with the creation of 11 separate ethnic governments that
had considerable autonomy.
   Namibia's first independent government will face the difficult
task of establishing itself as a national authority that remains
sensitive to local customs.
