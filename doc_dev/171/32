This is not a review; it is a sneak preview. A month hence Derek Jarman's
new film Blue should reach public screens and before that you may catch it
at the Edinburgh Film Festival (one performance only, August 22). But unlike
Jurassic Park or Last Action Hero, it will not explode on every doorstep in
the glory of Hollywood Hyperama. Nor will there be a movie tie-in industry
of Blue hamburgers, T-shirts and model dinosaurs.
Indeed there is scarcely, in the normal sense of the word, a movie. Blue is
76 minutes of the title colour, projected without change or inflection
beyond the blips and scratches on the celluloid itself. While the soundtrack
blends voices, music and sound effects, the screen just sits there being
blue. While actors recite Jarman's scripted thoughts, and everything from
sea noises to babbling crowds and heart-thumps mix with the verbal musings
on life and death, art and Aids, beauty and pain, the sole balm for the eyes
is that single-colour rectangle. It flickers like a midnight-blue heart
monitor that has lost its pulse line.
You may already be reaching for your desk diary to pencil in 'Avoid Blue on
every available date.' Deny yourself that self-denial. Would you believe
that I sat there in a large North London cinema last week with an invited
audience of 30 in pin-drop awe and silence? Or that Blue is not the
Emperor's new clothes but the Artist's coat of many colours transformed -
concentrated? distilled? - to a blue thought (the film) in a blue shade (the
cinema)?
Blue is about failing sight and intensifying vision. Jarman himself, long an
HIV victim, has deteriorating eyesight along with the other hundred horrors
freely available to Aids sufferers. He details these - wryly, stoically -
through the voice-overs in Blue. But instead of being a condemned man's
litany of last thoughts, the film uses despair as a slipway to hope and
strength and even to a defiant delight. The more insufferably singular is
that 'patch of blue' (Wilde's prison-cell view made movie image), the more
overpoweringly plural are the flickers of thought, sensation and insight
that it provokes.
The film, it could be said, uses an age-old hypnotist's trick. Show your
patients the right kind of rhythmic nothingness - a swinging watch, a
swaying light, a single flickering colour - and they will slip into a
high-productivity coma. By lunchtime they will have remembered their whole
past and possibly been programmed for a saner future.
Blue, though, is more than trickery, though it is never less than hypnotic.
It gives you the freedom to flee if you wish. (Jarman's catalogue of
hospital experiences alone may have you reaching for the mental opt-out
switch.) But finally you do not want to escape. The soundtrack is too rich,
too astonishing: with Jarman's words etching life out of death while Simon
Fisher Turner's music works its eerie, elemental magic. And the imagery -
that pool of colour that beckons and absorbs your attention and then returns
it re-baptised, re-sensitised - is too pliant, too precious to be resisted
by any filmgoer brought up on the rude, unchanging colours of commercial
cinema.
*****
Oh dear and here they are. Sentimental pink for Apres L'Amour. Throw-up
yellow for Made In America. Re-issue rust colour for In Cold Blood. And
plasticky rainbow hues for two production-slate fillers from Disney.
Apres L'Amour and Made In America are interchangeable tales of modern
womanhood. Whoopi Goldberg in the first has a child but no
mate/husband/breadwinner: above all, no papa for her paternally challenged,
sperm-bank-conceived daughter Nia Long. Isabelle Huppert in the French film
has enough men to fill to flood-alert level the average sperm bank but -
yes, you guess correctly - no children.
Movie folk should get together to solve each other's problems on an exchange
basis. In America Mlle Huppert would find a fulfilling, not to say
asphyxiating degree of motherly fulfilment in Miss Goldberg's homey-folksy
milieu: a San Francisco of brittle marriages but teeming wombs, where
pinbright teenagers dash about the land searching for missing parents. In
Made In America the supposed father of Goldberg's daughter is revealed to be
Ted Danson: white (bad), male (worse) and a car salesman (unspeakable).
Soon, though, young Nia is adoring him and so is the initially hostile
Whoopi. By curtain-time - but in the long afternoons of the silly season how
long that is in coming - everyone is looking dewy-eyed at everyone else.
Seeking men, a lonely Whoopi could have gone to France to rent the flat of
Isabelle (Apres L'Amour) Huppert. Here the door is almost off its hinges
with the to-ing and fro-ing of lovers: chiefly, tired but handsome architect
Bernard Giradeau and puppyish-pretty singer-composer Hippolyte Girardot.
La Huppert tries to keep both these relationships going, but you know how it
is. Each man is married; each has a mortgage and children; and when the
crunch comes, it is always 'Ma cherie, ce n'est pas pour toujours.' Plus
which, the heroine herself silently longs for offspring.
Huppert was last seen by us in Madame Bovary. She is still wearing Emma's
look of pale anomie, as of one struck by Life while crossing its busy road
without looking. But where Flaubert supplied his heroine with a good script,
writer-director Diane Kurys (Coup De Foudre, A Man In Love) can only ring
dwindling changes on a soap-operatic plot of musical beds and frustrated
motherhood.
A Far Off Place and Champions are two lost-looking Disney films. The first
answers a question we might have spent our whole lives not pondering. What
would we do if we had to cross the Kalahari on foot, with no provisions of
food or water and 1000 miles to cover to the nearest town?
Young Reese Witherspoon, freshly-orphaned daughter of two white South
Africans killed by ivory poachers, must do this. For company she has only
two young friends - a white boy (Ethan Randall) and a Bushman (Sarel Bok) -
and soon the usual things that happen in deserts are happening. Mirages,
sandstorms, miraculous stumblings upon water and a Central Casting villain
(Jack Thompson) shooting at them from a helicopter.
Laurens van der Post wrote the two original stories on which the film is
based and noted ex-cameraman Mikael Salomon (Backdraft, Far And Away)
directed. But it all resembles 'Walkabout 2: The Plot Runs Out Of Ideas.' We
sense neither the miles nor the days. We feel neither thirst nor hunger. We
marvel only at the leisure-time the characters have in which to play games,
to fall in love, to tell stories and even - surely a first? - to make
blouses from springbok hide.
Champions was called The Mighty Ducks in America and made a small fortune.
Crossing the ocean, it has lost its original title and failed to find a visa
for its original charm. Who in England will jump about at the story of a
little-league ice hockey team managed by a burnt-out veteran (Emilio
Estevez, all of 30) who wants to redeem his long-ago failures as a player?
Director Stephen Herek directs early scenes with the visual snap and
off-wall wit he brought to Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure. But once the
games start, the fun stops. Don't we just know - can we even doubt  - that
these Minneapolis youngsters will go all the way to a tear-filled finale
when the rank outsiders (they) will beat the glowering, macho favourites:
twice their size, dressed in black and all but accompanied by Spaghetti
Western villain music.
Like a cooling ice-block to the head, you can always apply Richard Brooks's
In Cold Blood to your brain. The 1967 true-life murder story returns to the
ICA, still chilling in its black-and-white docudrama immediacy if still a
touch browbeating in its late-on liberal message-mongering.
