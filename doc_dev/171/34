   Here is a brief look at Namibia, which
became independent from South Africa today:

   GEOGRAPHY _ The 318,252 square-mile country is mostly desert,
with scattered deposits of valuable minerals. It is bounded by the
Atlantic Ocean, South Africa, Zambia, Botswana and Angola. Its only
deep-water port, Walvis Bay, stays part of South Africa after
independence.

   HISTORY _ South Africa has ruled Namibia since capturing the
territory of South-West Africa from Germany in 1915. The South-West
Africa Peoples Organization (SWAPO) began guerrilla attacks in
1966, after South Africa rejected a U.N. resolution demanding it
relinquish control of the territory. An estimated 20,000 people,
mostly SWAPO guerrillas, died in the fighting, which ended in April
1989.
   U.N. Resolution 435, adopted in 1978, established the
independence process. It was not implemented until April 1, 1989,
after the United States and the Soviet Union brokered an agreement
calling for South African and Cuban troop withdrawals from
neighboring Angola, where SWAPO bases were located. SWAPO won the
most votes in November 1989 elections, but had to compromise with
other parties in writing a Western-style, democratic constitution.

   POPULATION _ The 1981 census recorded a population of 1.3
million, but the return of 40,000 exiles and the growth rate of 2.7
percent a year makes the figure out-of-date. The population is
predominantly black, divided among seven major ethnic divisions,
plus Bushmen, mixed-race groups, and 75,000 whites.

<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ SWAPO was strongly committed to socialism while in
exile but, since winning the November election, has spoken more
often of working with the mining, farming and fishing industries to
create jobs, educate and improve living conditions for the
impoverished black majority.
   South African aid, coupled with the white-controlled industries,
has made Namibia one of the few African countries to achieve an
annual per capita income of $1,000. But the country's wealth is
concentrated in the hands of the whites, who make up 6 percent of
the population, and South Africa is ending its aid.
