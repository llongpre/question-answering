  [Text] At least six regional leaders of the Wit Wolwe 
[White Wolves] will apparently support the Freedom Front of 
General Constand Viljoen in the election. Earlier this week 
their leader, Barend Strydom, also indicated his support for the 
Freedom Front. A man claiming to be the leader of the Wit Wolwe 
in the southern [Orange] Free State, Mr. Eddie Visagie, told our 
Bloemfontein staff that he and the Wit Wolwe leaders in the 
northern [Orange] Free State, Eastern and Northern Cape, 
Kalahari, and the Transvaal have all decided to support the 
Freedom Front in the coming election. The Freedom Front said 
earlier that the party welcomed any support; however, it would 
not consider Mr. Strydom as a candidate because of his past.
