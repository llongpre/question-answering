  [Text] Armscor this week revealed exactly how it is beating 
its swords into ploughshares. 
  At a military research seminar in Braamfontein, Armscor 
senior manager Dr. Andre Buys described how the only country in 
the world to ever dismantle a nuclear weapons capability had 
gone about it. 
  South Africa has 400kg of highly enriched uranium in storage 
15km from Pretoria, supposedly safe against terrorists -- unless 
they have scientists on their side, said Mr. David Albright, 
president of the US-based Institute for Science and 
International Security. 
  South Africa also had a controversial batch of tritium, 
which 
daramatically increases the power of nuclear weapons, imported 
from Israel in exchange for uranium. 
  As part of the scheme, the tritium was sold for use in 
fluorescent signs such as those on cinema exits. 
  South Africa -- the founder member of "the ex-nuclear club" 
-- realized it had to commercialize its technology if it was to 
succeed in dismantling its nuclear weapons capability, said Dr. 
Buys. 
  Scores of Armscor ideas were whittled down to 17 business 
units with processes stemming from the uranium enrichment 
programme. 
  Centrifuges designed to enrich uranium were adapted to 
reduce 
emissions from industrial stacks, to filter air for helicopter 
turbines and to improve ventilation. 
  Staff members at Armscor subsidiaries involved in the 
construction of nuclear devices also came up with 200 commercial 
ideas that were hacked down to six projects. 
  These were: 
  --Explosive cladding. Metals aluminium that cannot be 
welded conventionally are joined by explosives; 
  --Creating rare-earth magnets; 
  --Linking tungsten to copper or silver for use in 
electrical switchgear; 
  --Hot isostatic pressing which allowed components to be 
made from matallic powders; 
  --Pyrotechnic products which include special focused 
explosives to break up big boulders; and, 
  --A medical ventilator. 
  However, Dr. Buys said it was not known if the technology 
conversion would be successful in the long term. 
  "Since no one else has dismantled a nuclear weapons program, 
there is nowhere to look for advice." 
  The 400kg of highly enriched uranium outside Pretoria cannot 
immediately be reconstituted into weapon form. 
  And, with a glut of nuclear material on world markets, it is 
only worth R15-million. 
  But if, as the ANC wishes, it is used to make medical 
isotopes, the value will increase to R500-million. 
  However, Western nations oppose this option because they 
fear 
the "black bomb" -- industry terminology for a black nation with 
nuclear-weapons capability. 
  Mr. Albright said: "America doesn't want highly enriched 
uranium to remain in South Africa." 
  At the ANC's military research group meeting in Johannesburg 
this week, he said the West wanted the possibility of 
bomb-making removed from South African soil. 
  But Mr. Albright said: "The US government won't give up on 
highly enriched uranium. They don't want to hurt South Africa 
economically -- they just don't want it to have this power." 
  One the other side, the ANC was "upset by the lack of trust, 
the idea that it wants to create a black bomb." 
  "If highly enriched uranium wasn't present in South Africa, 
it would take years before it could get a nuclear weapon here," 
said Mr. Albright. 
  "But as it is, the project could be reconstituted in secret 
and it would take only a few months." 
  Mr. Dion Smith of Armscor confirmed that a maximum of 1,000 
South Africans had known about the nuclear military program -- 
so reconstitution in secret was not impossible. 
  The closest South Africa came to using one was in 1987. 
  Test-bomb shafts were dug in the Kalahari desert and later 
closed in the 70's. 
  But they were reopened in 1987, said the ANC's Roger 
Jardine, 
because "the Cubans were overrunning the SADF in Angola." 
  Dr. Buys said: "The shafts were reopened in relation to 
events in Angola. The war was reaching a semi-conventional state 
and it was backed by the Soviet Union." 
  The thinking was that if South Africa detonated a nuclear 
bomb in a shaft, the Americans would pick it up on satellite or 
seismic equipment and would be forced to help -- or risk SA 
using remaining "credible devices." 
  And so the watchers and the watched, former adversaries, 
continue to debate the chronology and detail of what really 
happened, with Armscor asking for a copy of a Soviet report it 
says "cannot exist."
