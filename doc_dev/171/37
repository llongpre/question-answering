   Here are some facts about the elections
being held in Namibia today through Saturday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE VOTING _ Namibia's 701,483 registered voters will choose a
72-member constituent assembly that is to draft a constitution for
the country when it becomes independent from South Africa next
year. Assembly seats will be assigned on a proportional basis,
according to each party's share of the total vote.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE VOTERS _ Namibians over 18 were eligible to register if they
or their parents were born in the territory, or if they have lived
in Namibia for four years. More than 40,000 exiles, mostly
supporters of the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO),
returned on U.N. flights to participate. About 12,000 white South
Africans are qualified to vote. Sixty percent of Namibians are
illiterate and the ballots show symbols next to the party names.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE CANDIDATES _ Ten political parties have submitted candidate
lists, from which the assembly members will be chosen. The top
contenders are SWAPO, which waged a war against South African
occupation from 1966 until April; and the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, a multiracial coalition which participated in the
territorial government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KEY ISSUE _ SWAPO is expected to win the most votes, but a key
question is whether it will win the two-thirds majority needed to
write a constitution without consulting other parties.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ The 318,252-square-mile territory is mostly desert,
with scattered deposits of valuable minerals. A 1981 census
recorded a population of 1.3 million, but the return of refugees
and the growth rate of 2.7 percent a year makes the figure
outdated. The population is predominantly black, divided among
seven major ethnic divisions, plus Bushmen, mixed-race groups, and
75,000 whites. The territory is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean,
South Africa, Zambia, Botswana and Angola.

<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ South Africa has ruled Namibia since capturing the
territory of South-West Africa from Germany in 1915. U.N.
Resolution 435, adopted in 1978, established the process for ``free
and fair elections.'' It was implemented April 1, 1989, after the
United States and Soviet Union brokered an agreement calling for
South African and Cuban troop withdrawals from neighboring Angola,
where SWAPO guerrilla bases were located.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE U.N. ROLE _ Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator
of the territory, is in charge of the elections, while U.N. Special
Representative Martti Ahtisaari has the task of declaring whether
the voting has been free and fair. Territorial police, watched by
1,500 U.N. police monitors, were guarding the polls to prevent
violence. Another 6,150 U.N. soldiers and officials were on hand as
well as 1,000 observers from 25 countries.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE RESULTS _ The ballots are to be counted at regional centers
and results are expected on or after Nov. 15. U.N. Resolution 435
does not specify a procedure for formation of an independent
government once the constitution is written.
