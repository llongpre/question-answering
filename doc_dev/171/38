What does literature do? What is it for? These splendid essays, selected from 
25 years' worth of sharp, firm responses to the particularly grotesque and 
challenging conditions for writers in South Africa, do nothing less than answer 
these huge questions. But they are not bombastic utterances. Nadine Gordimer is 
an unboastful, honest writer who dislikes cant. One of her mentors, cited with 
respectful pleasure, is Turgenev, whose "unpretentious essays," she says, in a 
phrase that can be reapplied to her own work, "make up a remarkable testament 
to a writer's creed." 
</P>
<P>
Her own creed is simple. Politically, it rests on two absolutes: "Racism is 
evil"; "Art is on the side of the oppressed." (If you question the latter, ask 
yourself, she says, "what writer of any literary worth defends fascism, 
totalitarianism, racism?") The writer's job is twofold. He (or she, but 
Gordimer, who has other things on her mind than feminism, always says he) has 
to reconcile his interior, secret, imaginative world with his responsibility to 
what's outside, to history. Through this reconciliation (an especially 
difficult one to make in her country), writing tries to go beyond what has so 
far been "allowed." 
</P>
<P>
When Gordimer played truant from school as a child, she needed, like all 
children, to be told that the world she felt so confined by was not the only 
possible world, that there might be an existence she did not yet know was 
"permissible." That, she insists, is what writing is for: to "explore 
possibilities present but undreamt of in the living of a single life," to 
record "unconfessed history"; in Yeats' words, "to express a life that has 
never found expression." 
</P>
<P>
If writing's job is to permit or express the impermissible and unexpressed, it 
follows that although "censorship may have to do with literature, literature 
has nothing whatever to do with censorship." 
</P>
<P>
Gordimer's life is spent where a conflict over the right of books to be read 
(and written) is built into the writer's life -- as it is still in Eastern 
Europe and in many other parts of the world. In the West, this conflict has 
just been brought home to us in momentous and horrifying form by the 
ayatollah's anathematizing of Salman Rushdie. In the earlier stages of the 
Muslim vendetta against "The Satanic Verses," Rushdie had to cancel a visit to 
South Africa, one of the countries where the book is now banned. Gordimer was 
among those who spoke out strongly against this curtailing of a writer's 
freedom. The case would be close to her heart, since it is the most extreme 
version imaginable of the perpetual opposition between art and orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
That opposition displays similar features in widely variant contexts, whether 
these be Iranian fundamentalism, apartheid, Stalinism, anti-Semitism or the 
militaristic variant of Zionism. In the context in which Gordimer writes, the 
government's efforts, at once ludicrous and malevolent, to ban, raid, censor, 
imprison, exile and silence writers who express alternative versions of history 
to its own, can provide any of them with a South African version of Rushdie's 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
The essays in "The Essential Gesture" are not only about censorship. They range 
widely over politics, literature, travel to other African countries and notable 
individuals. But their essential subject is always the writer's responsibility. 
This makes the book at once a life story and a history of South Africa. Stephen 
Clingman's clear (if a little too hagiographical) commentary places the essays 
in a changing context and points up their interesting connections with 
Gordimer's fiction. So we move from the liberal, optimistic response to events 
like the 1957 Treason Trial of Chief Luthulu and other ANC members, to the 
outrage at the dark acts of the '60s, the Sharpeville killings, the banning of 
the ANC and the trial and life imprisonment of the white Communist Bram 
Fischer, the inspiration for "Burger's Daughter." In the '70s, with the "Soweto 
Revolt," the essays record the "failure of the liberal ideal" and the changing 
relations between white progressives and the Black Consciousness movement. More 
recently, as in her novels, "July's People" and "A Sport of Nature," the 
writing looks, not always hopefully, at the example of other post-colonial 
African countries and anticipates the implications of revolution in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
There is a danger for the writer in being always on the side of the angels. 
Sometimes these essays, speaking of "relevance" and "commitment," edge toward 
the worthily pious. Gordimer is acutely aware of the problems in "conforming to 
an orthodoxy of opposition." The risk is greatest, she sees, for the black 
writer, who is expected to adopt the "kit" of "reliable emotive phrases," 
partly because "agitprop" has been "the first contemporary art form that many 
black South Africans feel they can call their own." But this is a dilemma for 
white writers too. Gordimer knows that nothing she says in her public speeches 
"will be as true as my fiction" and that fiction cannot do the job of speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The perils of belonging too much to an ideology of resistance are set against 
the problems of having nowhere to belong. In many of these essays, Gordimer 
considers, realistically and penetratingly, changing relations between black 
and white writers in South Africa, and the inevitable "double alienation" of a 
writer such as herself, "non-European" and "non-Black." How the white writers 
who stay on in South Africa are to accept their future role as the voices of an 
unwanted and isolated minority is a subject that requires all her honesty and 
firmness of mind. She can only hope that by continuing to say "we" of white and 
black writers, she can endorse the possibility of "a single, common, indigenous 
nature for art in South Africa," not a falsely imposed or fatally divided 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
It is also apparent to her that alienation is (up to a point) not a burden but 
a necessity for the writer. This perception makes her an excellent observer of 
countries where she is made to feel non-existent: "To be white in the streets 
of Accra is to feel oneself curiously anonymous and almost invisible; one is 
aware of one's unimportance, in terms of what a white face has meant and now 
means to people." She records, with wonderful exactness and curiosity, scenes 
from a world where the white view is irrelevant: the night-time halt of a river 
boat in the Congo, gorgeous "ladies of joy" in a Brazzaville open-air cafe, 
lavish erotic designs -- symbols of fertility -- on Malagasy tombs, a picnic 
party of women in full Victorian dress (unchanged descendants of pre-1914 
refugees from Namibia) eating porridge in the Kalahari desert. Throughout her 
travels, Gordimer compares the African states (such as Ghana) that are 
"dedicated to radical change in the life of the masses" and those (such as the 
Ivory Coast) that have fostered a black elite and are dependent on foreign 
investments. In these diagnoses of possible African developments, she takes as 
her motto the messages she spots written up on buses and taxis in Ghana: "It 
changes," and "Merci Dieu." These essays, too, records of a dramatically 
changing history by a tolerant, flexible, adaptive mind, are sermons on that 
text: "Merci Dieu, it changes."
