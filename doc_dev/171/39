Timothy Asch, director of USC's Center for Visual Anthropology, sees a 
not-too-distant day when new anthropological research will be published 
complete with accompanying films, stored on a 3-inch videodisc in a pocket 
inside the book jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Asch, who co-produced with anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon a series of 
ground-breaking films on the fierce Yanomamo Indians of South America, sees a 
number of ways in which his science will benefit from the explosion of video 
technology, which puts ever-more-sophisticated cameras into ever-smaller and 
easier-to-use packages. 
</P>
<P>
"The type of knowledge and expertise that anthropologists have could, in 
collaboration with ethnographic film makers, turn into a tremendous resource," 
Asch told an audience at the 12th annual Symposium of Man held recently at Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The use of film to record non-Western cultures is nothing new, stretching back 
at least to "Nanook of the North," Robert Flaherty's famed 1921 docudrama about 
an Eskimo family. Since the '20s, cultural anthropologists have often turned to 
film as a way to record the people and cultures they study. 
</P>
<P>
But sound synchronization in the field was not practical until about 1960, and 
film equipment has until recently been cumbersome and difficult to use under 
the often-trying conditions that greet anthropologists. Advances in film and 
especially video technology, developed primarily for the entertainment 
industry, have revolutionized ethnographic film making, Asch said. 
</P>
<P>
As director of the USC master's degree program in visual anthropology, Asch is 
training film makers who will collaborate with field anthropologists to record 
data that was once the exclusive domain of notebook and sketch pad. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage to recording a culture on film or video is that several 
scientists can view the same piece of data, rather than having to rely on one 
person's observations, according to noted ethnographic film maker Patsy Asch, 
Timothy's wife. In some instances, the ability to repeatedly view a film is 
another advantage, as in the case of dance kinesics or studying intricate 
rituals. 
</P>
<P>
But most importantly, the films often serve as a final record of many tribal 
cultures that are being decimated by the destruction of tropical forests and by 
other encroachments of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
"The tribal world is disappearing at a staggeringly high rate, one that is 
accelerating on a day-by-day basis," said Chagnon, another of the panelists. A 
professor at UC Santa Barbara since 1984, Chagnon's 25 years of studying the 
Yanomamo has formed the basis of one of the best-known case studies in cultural 
anthropology, one that is found in most introductory textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Chagnon, who concentrates on Yanomamo tribes in southern Venezuela, said he has 
seen changes in the culture each time he returns (13 visits, totaling 50 
months). The Yanomamo of northern Brazil, meanwhile, have been virtually wiped 
out in recent years, since the discovery of gold on their land in 1987 
attracted more than 40,000 prospectors virtually overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The Yanomamo of southern Venezuela, meanwhile, may have a better chance of 
survival precisely because the films of Tim Asch and Chagnon have given them a 
place in the public consciousness, Chagnon believes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are groups like the Yanomamo and the bushmen (of southwest Africa's 
Kalahari Desert) who have become very, very significant in the minds of lots 
and lots of people," Chagnon said. "Because they have been documented in a very 
positivistic, straightforward, scientific way, (that) can now be used to help 
them to survive the destruction that is going on. . . . They have become 
symbols. They represent the tragedy of all other tribal people in all places on 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Chagnon's assertions on the potential political uses of ethnographic 
film, other panelists raised doubts about its scientific importance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that technology is going to save us," said Jay Ruby, an 
anthropology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia and editor of the 
journal, Visual Anthropology. "CD ROMs and 8-mm video and high-resolution 
television are not going to help us think." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than training more people to make movies, Ruby suggested teaching 
students how to analyze and interpret filmed data. "I think we're drowning in a 
sea of images, and I'd like to argue that we take fewer pictures and start 
thinking more, because I'm very bored with continually seeing basically the 
same lame ideas on the screen," Ruby said. 
</P>
<P>
"I work with some students who are just technological wizards but don't have a 
single thing to say," Ruby said. "They're all dressed up with nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
One panelist, John Homiak, is an archivist with the Human Studies Film Archives 
at the Smithsonian Institution. More than 5 million feet of film and video are 
stored in the archives, Homiak said, but he thinks the resource is woefully 
under-utilized. 
</P>
<P>
That is largely because most anthropologists want to make their name with their 
own field research, Tim Asch said, rather than by studying the research of 
other anthropologists. But, he added, the collected films and videos will take 
on more importance as time goes on and the tribal cultures recorded for 
posterity continue to be diluted and sometimes obliterated. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, he said, if there existed a film record of an Aztec sacrifice, or of a 
vintage performance of Shakespeare's "King Lear" at the Globe Theatre. It may 
be 100 or 200 years before the archives are truly utilized. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go for the long term," Asch argued. "It's important to take visual 
anthropology seriously."
