THE VOICE OF THUNDER by Laurens van der Post Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99,
229 pages
SIR LAURENS van der Post has led a life of adventure - soldier in the
jungles of the Far East, explorer of the deserts of Southern Africa, great
white hunter. Like a character in a John Buchan novel, he is equally at home
in tent and palace, welcomed, trusted and consulted as sincerely in Botswana
as in Belgravia.
Unlike the predecessors who trampled uncomprehendingly over local cultures,
he was sensitive and sympathetic. He understood that simple technology does
not imply simple minds; that peoples without books may share rich resources
of legendary traditions; and that those whose lives are precariously
balanced retain an understanding of the changing seasons, the vital force of
rain and sun, our kinship with animals, and other aspects of humanity which
are lost or obscured in the comfortable West.
Van der Post wrote marvellous books. He was quick to exploit television when
it was new and to help change old attitudes. To the post-imperial generation
brought up in this country after the war, as well as to recent
environmentalists and conservationists, Laurens van der Post is a modern
hero.
His new book The Voice of Thunder brings together two pieces written some
years ago,'The Little Memory' and 'The Great Memory', and a recent essay,
'The Other Journey'. The earlier pieces are classic van der Post, part
autobiography, part good yarn about the desert, interspersed with
observations and speculations about how the bushmen of the Kalahari see the
world and how we can share their wisdom.
The new essay has no narrative, it is an old man's meditation on the story
of the Odyssey, the perpetual cycle of departure, return and departure which
he sees as intrinsic to all lives.
As he has grown older, van der Post's mystical streak has become more
pronounced. He is sure he has a message to pass on, but it is hard to pin
down what exactly it is. The ancient Greeks would have recognised his awe at
the power of nature as a sense of the divine, Pan in the woods, Nereids in
the Ocean, without implying a personal deity or an intended discoverable
design. The romantic poets shared his vision of the mountains, the torrents
and the deserts as metaphors of the tempests and aridities of life. Jung,
whom van der Post knew personally, suggested the concept of the collective
unconscious, the cumulative effect of heredity and experience, which is
unique to each individual but of which a good deal is also shared with other
human beings.
Van der Post sees a revealed secret in the urge of the unconscious to become
conscious. Perhaps, he suggests elsewhere, everything in the universe is
synchronised. The metaphor of a journey can give shape to recurring patterns
in human lives. Mixing personal experience with fragments of science, myth
and literature, drawing on a quotation here and a famous name there, van der
Post constantly risks appearing banal and confused. He is a remarkable man,
but wonderment and benevolence are not, by themselves, enough to make a poet
or a philosopher.
