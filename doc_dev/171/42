   Party flags, T-shirts and posters,
paraphernalia of Namibia's independence-election campaign, abound
in this remote outpost of the diminutive Bushmen, the territory's
earliest inhabitants.
   But the crucial issue among them is not independence from South
Africa; it's survival.
   Bushman farmers, limited to a fraction of their traditional
territory, hope to retain enough land to raise themselves just to
subsistence levels when Namibia becomes independent after the
voting Nov. 7-11.
   Those Bushmen who fought for South Africa during a 23-year war
against pro-independence guerrillas in Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa, are living off their last military paychecks and
waiting to hear the army's plans for their future. Others languish
in the slums of Bushmanland's only town, Tshumkwe.
   The third smallest of Namibia's 11 ethnic groups, the 33,000
Bushmen have never been united politically. They are scattered
across an arid territory and speak a half-dozen languages,
including Afrikaans, the language of the majority of South Africa's
whites.
   Thirty years ago, some Namibian Bushmen survived solely by
hunting and gathering, as did their ancestors. Today, even the
Ju@wa in eastern Bushmanland, the only group still in possession of
its traditional hunting grounds, must raise cattle and vegetables
to survive.
   Toma, a young Bushman who speaks Afrikaans as well as Ju@wa's
clicking language, said the elections mark the first time his
people have been wooed by political parties. He hopes independence
will bring a high school and more shops in Tshumkwe, a job for him,
and a better house for his family in the tiny, grass-hut village of
Gautcha.
   The United Nations-supervised elections will determine the
make-up of a constitution-writing assembly. Independence, after 74
years of South African rule, will come once the constitution and
new government are in place.
   Although elections are new to the Bushmen, they know the rural
development policies of the new government could affect them
dramatically.
   They have been invited to community meetings by officials of the
South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the guerrilla
movement that is the front-runner in the campaign. They have
received free food and T-shirts from supporters of SWAPO's main
rival, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance.
   SWAPO says it plans to redistribute unused or foreign-owned land
to those without property, but Theo-Ben Gurirab, a senior SWAPO
official, said the party wants to get away from ethnic stereotypes.
   He added that he believes Bushmen have become the focus of what
he calls disproportionate and misguided concern, particularly
abroad, over what might happen to the Bushmen, their traditions and
cultures.
   ``We do not want to lock them in a zoo for foreigners to come
and experiment on how they used to live,'' Gurirab said. ``We're
going to look at them as citizens of Namibia whose needs should be
attended to.''
   Gurirab condemned as ``sinister'' suggestions by South African
officials to move to South Africa Bushmen soldiers worried about
their future in independent Namibia.
   Erno Gauerke, an official of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,
said Bushmen were struggling through a difficult transition from
traditional to modern society. He said his party, a multiracial,
pro-capitalist coalition, would try to promote rural agricultural
development and a shift from communal to private land use.
   John Marshall of the Ju@wa Bushman Development Foundation said
the Bushmen now are Namibia's equivalent of India's
``untouchables.'' But he said increasing numbers of other Namibians
could face similar hardship unless economic trends are reversed.
   Marshall, an American filmmaker and anthropolgist whose
organization seeks to promote small-scale farming projects in
Bushmanland, said the Bushmen are trapped between outsiders'
sentimental views that they should be protected from the modern
world and the reality of their poverty.
   They face ``death by myth,'' he said, when what they want is a
chance to achieve self-sufficiency.
   The Namibian Bushman population has declined at a rate of about
5 percent every 10 years, Marshall said.
   The Rev. Ferdie Weich of the Dutch Reformed Church, who has done
missionary work in several Bushmen communities, said illiteracy is
widespread.
   ``At school, there's a certain amount of unidentifiable
discrimination against the Bushmen,'' he said.
   Because of the scarcity of teachers who speak their languages,
Bushman children are taught in Afrikaans.
   The Bushmen will be dependent for several generations on outside
financial help and on the perserverance of those who try to assist
them, Weich said.
   The Ju@wa foundation has helped establish 20 new villages in
Bushmanland where residents tend gardens and raise cattle as well
as hunt and gather.
   Project director Megan Biesele said the farming cooperative they
have formed is an attempt to translate their ancient system of land
use into modern terms to gain leasehold over the area.
   The foundation hopes to establish 15 more villages of 30 to 35
people each and to improve education and health services.
