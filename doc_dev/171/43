   HISTORY _ The Portuguese were the first whites to reach the
territory's Atlantic coast in the 15th century. The Dutch, British
and Germans came later, and Germany declared the territory a
protectorate in 1884. South Africa occupied the land during World
War I and began to administer it in 1920 under a League of Nations
mandate. The league's successor, the United Nations, terminated the
mandate in 1966. The South-West Africa People's Organization,
SWAPO, has been leading an armed guerrilla struggle against the
South Africans since 1966 in a bid to obtain independence for
Namibia.

   TERRITORY _ About 15 percent of the 318,260-square-mile country
is covered by the Namib desert. Despite its immense size it has
only 1.3 million people. More than half are from the Ovambo tribe
and live in the north. There are less than 100,000 whites.

   GOVERNMENT _ South Africa continues to administer the territory.
Louis Pienaar, the administrator-general, is appointed by and
reports directly to the South African government. Pienaar heads a
multiracial transitional government that is designed to give way to
an elected government when the territory receives independence.

the two main industries. Only about one-third of the country has
sufficient rain for farming.
