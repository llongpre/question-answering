   Air Botswana in April will become the
first non-South African airline to provide service to Namibia,
following its independence, officials said Friday.
   The airline will begin service from Gaborone to Windhoek on April
2, a day after the U.N. independence plan for the South
African-ruled territory takes effect, said Air Botswana marketing
manager Joyce Thema.
   Until now, only South African Airways and small commercial
airlines from that country have flown to Namibia. Foreign visitors
must clear customs and immigration in South Africa before going to
the territory.
   The Air Botswana flights will bypass South Africa, but visitors
to the territory may still be checked by South African police and
other officials until independence is complete in about a year.
