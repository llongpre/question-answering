   Here are some facts and figures on Namibia:

   THE LAND _ Namibia covers 318,261 square miles, stretching
between the Orange River on the South African border northward 780
miles to the Cunene River on the Angolan border. To the east is
Botswana. To the west is the South Atlantic. The Namib desert runs
along the entire seaboard, and the southern two-thirds of the
country receives little rain.

   THE PEOPLE _ One of the world's most sparsely populated areas,
Namibia has an estimated 1.3 million people occupying territory as
large as France and West Germany combined. There are 11 main ethnic
groups, including two mixed-race groups, eight black groups and
about 75,000 whites. The Ovambo people, who inhabit the relatively
fertile northern region, make up about half the population.

   THE ECONOMY _ The economy is dominated by mining, which generates
about one-fourth of the gross domestic product. The principal
minerals are diamonds, uranium and copper. There is little
commercial farming, other than livestock ranching, and foreign
countries have depleted fishing grounds off the coast. The
manufacturing sector is very small. The only deep-water port is
Walvis Bay, a South African enclave that South African officials say
will not be yielded to an independent Namibian government.

   POLITICS _ The U.N. independence plan for Namibia calls for a
seven-month transition period leading to elections for a national
assembly on Nov. 1. The South-West African People's Organization,
which has waged a low-level guerrilla war against South African rule
since 1966, is favored to win the election. It is expected to be
opposed by a coalition of white and black parties which have
participated in an interim administration installed by South Africa
in 1985.

   HISTORY _ Primitive people first came to Namibia 2,000 years ago.
Portuguese navigators reached the coast in the early 15th century,
and Dutch and British captains laid claim to parts of the coast in
the late 1700s. The Ovambo and Herero tribes migrated from
present-day Zaire to Namibia in the early 19th century, followed by
English and German missionaries. Britain annexed Walvis Bay in 1978.
In 1884, Germany proclaimed a protectorate over the area. The
discovery of diamonds in 1908 brought an influx of Europeans. South
Africa occupied the territory during World War I and began to
administer it in 1920 under a mandate from the League of Nations.
The league's successor body, the United Nations, revoked the mandate
in 1966, called for an end to South African rule and declared SWAPO
the legitimate representative of the Namibian people. Negotiations
aimed at bringing about independence have been under way for more
than a decade.
