   In a continent littered with economic
disasters, Namibia heads toward independence as a potential success
if it can meet the demands of poor blacks without alienating
wealthy whites and foreign investors.
   The desert territory has profitable mining, fishing and farming
industries and one of the best infrastructures in Africa, much of
it built with money from South Africa.
   White-controlled South Africa has administered Namibia, also
known as South-West Africa, for 74 years under a mandate from the
defunct League of Nations.
   Namibia's per capita income of about $1,000 annually is among
the highest in Africa. But economists say its independence could
bring a sharp economic decline and they list these reasons:
   _ South Africa, which has provided up to 25 percent of Namibia's
$750 million annual budget, is expected to cut virtually all aid
after independence, expected early next year.
   _ Thousands of Namibia's whites, concerned about the future
under a black-led government, are expected to leave the country or
move their assets to neighboring South Africa.
   _ Leaders of the South-West Africa People's Organization, the
guerrilla group expected to win pre-independence elections in
November, have virtually no hands-on economic experience. They
proclaim socialist policies associated with crumbling economies
elsewhere in Africa.
   ``SWAPO does not conceal its belief in the moral superiority of
socialism over capitalism,'' the organization said in an election
manifesto.
   ``The state will have ownership of a significant part of the
country's economic resources,'' it said. ``Egalitarianism forms the
basis of (SWAPO's) vision of a just social order.''
   Such promises are popular among the black majority in a
territory where the unemployment rate is estimated at 25 percent
and few blacks own homes or businesses.
   Will it work?
   All the southern African nations that have relied heavily on
state control of the economy _ Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania
and Mozambique _ have suffered economic declines or fallen short of
their potential.
   Botswana, the one black-ruled country in the region to pursue a
market-oriented economy, has prospered.
   ``SWAPO has raised expectations that will be difficult to meet
regardless of their policies,'' said Rainer Ritter, a private
economist in Windhoek.
   The organization has promised major improvements in education,
health care, housing and jobs.
   But SWAPO has not said how it will finance the programs. The
territory now has a budget deficit of about $180 million and a
foreign debt of more than $300 million.
   SWAPO will have to try to prevent a recession in the northern
towns and villages of the Ovambo tribe, where the organization
draws its strongest support.
   An estimated 50,000 South African soldiers have left Namibia
since the year-long independence plan took effect April 1. Most
were stationed in the north, where Namibians fought them but relied
on their money.
   Hundreds of small general stores, known as cuca shops, are
central to economic life in the north and are likely to suffer.
Thousands of Namibians employed by the military in jobs ranging
from soldiers to maids are now out of work.
   SWAPO has softened its hard-line socialist language in recent
months in an effort to encourage whites to stay and to attract
foreign investors.
   ``We will invite foreign investors to develop our economy,''
SWAPO President Sam Nujoma said recently in Cairo, Egypt. ``We do
not think the present moment is the time for nationalizations.''
   SWAPO also has made it clear it will accept a mixed economy and
needs the skills and capital of Namibia's 75,000 whites, who make
up 6 percent of the territory's 1.3 million people.
   Whites own an estimated 65 percent of private property in
Namibia and earn at least 10 times more than blacks on average,
according to SWAPO.
   SWAPO's main opponent, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, says
SWAPO's moderate tone will vanish if the organization comes to
power.
   SWAPO remains committed to ``an outdated and demonstrably
unsuccessful ideology _ that of doctrinaire socialism _ an ideology
that has already destroyed the economies of most African states,''
said the alliance, a multiracial coalition that favors a
market-oriented economy.
   The Namibian government, under South African control, already
accounts for more than half the territory's $1.3 billion gross
domestic product.
   Large diamond and uranium mining companies, owned by firms in
Britain and South Africa, make up the largest chunk of the private
sector.
   Consolidated Diamond Mining of Namibia, owned by De Beers of
South Africa, recently said SWAPO's economic views contain ``some
inaccuracies and a certain lack of realism.''
   But the company also said it was ``encouraged by (SWAPO's)
apparent willingness to negotiate'' and that willingness ``offers
scope for reconciliation between government and the private
sector.''
