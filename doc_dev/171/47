<LEADPARA>  The National Book Awards were given out Wednesday in New York. Our spies
beneath the podium say "Mating" (Knopf) by Norman Rush, a first novel about an
anthropologist's love affair in the Kalahari Desert, and "Freedom" (Basic
Books), the first volume of an epic study of the concept by Harvard
sociologist Orlando Patterson, were the fiction and nonfiction winners.;   A
National Book Award for poetry was bestowed on Philip Levine for his
collection "What Work Is." The prize was restored after a seven-year hiatus by
the National Book Foundation, sponsor of the 41-year-old competition.  </LEADPARA>
