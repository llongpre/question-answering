   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda on Tuesday
urged the United States to stop supporting Angolan rebels and paid
rare tribute to the Western nation, for mediating talks to bring
peace to southwestern Africa.
   A summit meeting of the six Front-line States in direct
confrontation with South Africa called for U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to hasten independence in South-West Africa,
also known as Namibia, and ensure the machinery for independence
remains under the control of the world body.
   The leaders of Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe also appealed to the international community for military
and other support during Namibia's U.N.-supervised transition to
independence.
   It was the first Front-line summit since Angola, Cuba and South
Africa signed a U.S.-negotiated peace accord.
   Under the agreement, signed Thursday in New York, South Africa
will grant independence to mineral-rich Namibia while Cuba withdraws
50,000 troops from Angola within 27 months.
   Opening the summit, Kaunda called on President-elect George Bush
to help the peace process by halting support to Jonas Savimbi's
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   Savimbi's rebels have been fighting Angola's Marxist government
since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The
guerrillas orginally were backed by South Africa, which for 73 years
has governed Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia. But in recent
years they also have won support from Washington.
   Neither Savimbi's movement nor guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization fighting for Namibian independence were
involved directly in the peace accord.
   However, Namibian guerrilla leader Sam Nujoma said on the eve of
the summit that he hoped this Christmas would be the last under
South African occupation for Namibia's 1 million people.
   At the summit, Kaunda praised the Reagan administration for
mediating months of fractured talks that finally resulted in the
accord. But he echoed black leaders' fears that South Africa will
renege.
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, whose nation stands to
gain most from the pact, was more optimistic. He declared Sunday he
was happy with the terms and predicted southern Africa would be
``transformed in the near future into a zone of peace and
international cooperation.''
   Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe have
been at the forefront of African efforts to end Pretoria's policy of
legal race separation and speed Namibian independence.
   Also at the summit are the three main guerrilla-backed political
movements fighting in southern Africa _ Nujoma's organization, and
the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress of
South Africa.
