  [Text] Prospects of violence are so great in South Africa 
that it is making hundreds of white people in South Africa flee 
across the border into the neighboring states of Zimbabwe, 
Namibia, Swaziland, and Botswana. However, as Derek James now 
reports from Gaborone, the locals of Botswana have also been 
making their own panic moves. 
  [Begin James recording] Botswana is attractive to South 
Africans because of its closeness, stability, and peace. 
Already stories abound and are confirmed by top Bank of 
Botswana officials of large amounts of South African rands being 
handed over to banks here. Monday's (?free) fall of the South 
African currency is not only a message of a collapse in overseas 
confidence, but also a strong signal to those who have money to 
get it out of South Africa. One such person handed over 300,000 
in South African rands, that is 50,000 pounds, into a Botswana 
bank account last week. Most South Africans are still not rich 
enough to afford top Botswana hotels and are staying with 
friends, but in Zimbabwe and Namibia the caravan parks are 
already filling up. Some South Africans will simply be making 
temporary use of neighboring countries. 
  Botswana itself is stocking up in preparation for a dramatic 
drop in supplies of food. Over 80 percent of our food comes 
from South Africa and traders have been warned that strikes, 
hijacking of vehicles, and the celebrations will mean limited 
supplies for at least four successive weeks. A senior Bank of 
Botswana official assured (?journalists) last week that 
Botswana's currency will be protected, but a dramatic 6.8 
percent drop in the South African rand since January is bound to 
affect the Botswana pula, which is partly linked to the rand. 
People in Botswana are filling their cupboards with tinned 
food, as they hear of South Africans' advice to stock up with 
food and water, gas cookers, candles, and matches, as the great 
days of election and freedom approach. 
  The shortages of food will hit the neighboring countries 
first, although the influx of money will be a temporary 
blessing, as Botswana is merely being used a conduit for the 
outflow of cash. [end recording]
