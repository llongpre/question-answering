  [Editorial Report] Following is a compilation of reports 
monitored by FBIS Mbabane Bureau from 14 to 20 March concerning 
outbreaks of and reports on various diseases. Items are listed 
by country and disease. Source follows each item. 
<H5>  Botswana </H5>
  AIDS -- Health Minister Bahitik Temane says a large 
proportion of patients have been admitted in every Botswana 
hospital with AIDS-related illnesses. Presenting his ministry's 
budget to Parliament yesterday, Mr. Temane said in the future 
the country's health services might not be able to maintain 
standards, as more and more resources get swallowed up by 
AIDS-related services. He said alternative programs like 
home-based care are being developed, but prevention remains the 
best solution. (Gaborone Radio Botswana Network in English 1610 
GMT 18 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  Diarrhea -- One person is dead and other serious cases of 
bloody diarrhea were reported since it affected the Mahelane 
location of Changalane Administration Region in Maputo 
Province's Namaacha District. Between 30 and 40 patients 
suffering from bloody diarrhea are being treated at the 
Changalane Health Post. Nurse Helena Bila says the epidemic is 
spreading because the people are using water from the Changalane 
River without boiling it. (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in 
Portuguese 1030 GMT 14 Mar 94) 
  Dysentery -- A total of 25 people have died of dysentery in 
Gaza Province over the past two months. Medical superintendent 
Dr. Mario Marine said more than 6,500 cases of dysentery were 
registered during the same period. Chokwe District was the most 
affected with about 2,000 cases. Dr. Mario Marine said the 
disease is mostly caused by bad hygiene and the consumption of 
unclean water. (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 
1030 GMT 17 Mar 94) 
  Dysentery -- The MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY (AIM) has 
learned that two government soldiers died of dysentery at the 
Lichinga Assembly Area in the capital of Niassa Province last 
February. The provincial government has already sent medicine 
and health personnel to the assembly area and improved the 
soldiers'diet. (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 
1400 GMT 19 Mar 94) 
  Cholera -- "Cholera has been affecting Cabo Delgado Province 
since the end of last year and it has already caused six deaths. 
A total of 660 cases of cholera were diagnosed between January 
and February of this year. Meanwhile, dysentery killed another 
four people over the same period." (Maputo Radio Mozambique 
Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 15 Mar 94) 
  AIDS -- "Officials of the National Program Against AIDS have 
said they were frightened of the AIDS situation in Tete 
Province. AIDS has grown tremendously in that province. The 
team visited Tete Province's Changara, Cahora Bassa, and the 
provincial capital." (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in 
Protuguese 1030 GMT 16 mar 94) 
<H5>  Namibia </H5>
  Tuberculosis -- "The oldest and most primitive people in 
southern Africa, the San or Bushmen of Namibia, are being 
threatened by a tuberculosis epidemic." Dr. Hans Nel, district 
surgeon for Gobabis, reports: "It is approximately the highest 
prevalence rate of tuberculosis right now in the world. When we 
started this study there were only 18 cases that we knew of that 
were positive for tuberculosis. At the end of one year's study 
and follow-up study there were 385 cases, which meant that there 
was quite a large percentage of positive cases identified." "It 
can pose a threat to the elimination of the Bushmen as a whole, 
especially the fact that they are a small group in a community, 
grouped together in a certain area in Namibia." (Johannesburg 
Channel Africa Radio in English 1100 GMT 17 Mar 94) 
  Meningitis -- Josef Mothina writes that "mass immunisation 
against the worst outbreak of meningitis in Namibia in 10 years 
is to start this week. So far at least 150 cases of the killer 
disease have been reported countrywide. Since the end of 
January, when the first cases of the disease were reported, 69 
cases have occurred in the south; 52 in Katutura and seven in 
the Otjozondjupa region." (Windhoek THE NAMIBIAN in English 14 
Mar 94 pp 1, 2) 
<H5>  South Africa </H5>
  New TB Strain -- Kathryn Strachan reports that "a new 
multidrug- resistant strain of tuberculosis is emerging in South 
Africa, with about 2 percent of TB [tuberculosis] cases proving 
resistant to treatment." At the Tuberculosis Beyond 2000 
conference in Pretoria on 14 March, Medical Research Council 
spokesman Dr. Karin Weyer said "in the U.S., HIV infection had 
been associated with outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB. This 
was cause for concern for SA, as the incidence of HIV was 
increasing. However, while nearly all multidrug-resistant TB 
patients in the U.S. were HIV positive, in SA the proportion was 
only about 3 percent. Local estimates of multidrug-resistant TB 
were low." (Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 15 Mar 94 p 2) 
<H5>  Zimbabwe </H5>
  AIDS -- The cumulative number of AIDS cases is estimated to 
rise to more than 130,000 by the end of this year, according to 
the National AIDS Coordination Program. There were more than 
30,000 estimated new cases of AIDS in 1993. At the moment, 
however, there are only 28,000 full-blown AIDS cases. (Harare
