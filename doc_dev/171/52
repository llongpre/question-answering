A CHANGE OF CLIMATE by Hilary Mantel Viking Pounds 15, 342 pages
Hilary Mantel is generally agreed to be one of the most interesting and
accomplished of the younger - or perhaps the middle - generation of our
novelists. Her last book, A Place of Greater Safety, was praised for its
portrait of Revolutionary France and won the Sunday Express prize as well as
a few grumbles about its extreme length. A Change of Climate is certain to
consolidate this reputation.
It tells of Ralph and Anna Eldred who have devoted their lives to what used
to be called Good Works. He is director of a charitable trust in Norfolk and
London, and his wife assists and endorses him and runs their family of four
children. As Kit, the eldest, says, 'My father is so bloody saintly it would
make you sick, but the trouble is it's real, it's all real. My mother . . .
she's saintly too'.
The lives of the Eldreds unravel in the course of an East Anglian summer
when their 20-year secret at last escapes. In the mid-1950s the Eldreds had
been sent to South Africa to work with a mission. First they lived outside
Pretoria in a freehold black township which, like Sophiatown and Lady
Selborne at that time, was to be razed by the apartheid government.
They became politically involved, were arrested and jailed and eventually
deported across the border to Bechuanaland. There, in a wretched place on
the edge of the Kalahari, they encountered catastrophe - a horrific tragedy
the nature of which I imagine most reviewers will choose not to reveal.
Hilary Mantel's novel sets itself to describe, and to understand, the effect
of this event on the subsequent lives of the Eldred family. Ralph as a young
man had believed in 'the complex perfectibility of the human heart'. He is,
and remains, a good man: 'If we are not to be mere animals, or babies, we
must always choose and choose to do good'.
He struggles to make sense of the episode in the Bechuanaland bush and to
come to terms with any responsibility: 'I accept that I made choices and
they were wrong, but then I think, too, that our lives have been ruined by
malign chance. I do not see any pattern here, any sense, any reason why this
had to happen . . .'
Back in Norfolk, his innocence still guarded by Anna, he determines to keep
going - which, as his wise sister warns him, is typical of a man and will be
at the expense of the people around him. Because - as she also believes -
women turn inwards; they fall ill; and, in Anna's case, they are destroyed.
Don't worry, Anna says, she won't be a problem, 'We're professional
Christians, aren't we, Ralph and me?' But one day, as the children approach
adulthood and her husband falls in love with a simpler, less anguished
woman, she cracks.
This is, I hope it is clear, a serious and intelligent novel about difficult
themes - the nature of evil, of forgiveness, of suppression, of acceptance.
Not that there is anything laboured or theoretical about the depiction of
these philosophies. The Eldred family is particularly well done, the
children and their friends all vividly and sympathetically realised.
Ms Mantel evidently has an equal familiarity with both Norfolk and southern
Africa: she catches, for instance, the embarrassed ambivalence of
well-meaning foreigners when they encounter the African reality - 'The
village men were meagre, spiritless and skinny. The women were great tubes
of fat, blown out with carbohydrate . . . Their voices were harsh,
monotonous, somehow triumphal. God help me, Anna thought: but I don't like
them, perhaps I fear them. These feelings were a violation of everything she
expected from herself, of all her principles and habits of mind . . .'
My only hesitation is that, because the novelist's beam plays over so many
characters, Ralph and Anna both remain a fraction under-exposed. They remain
always at a certain distance. We recognise them, but we do not enter their
private lives, and so we are impressed where we should be moved. Many
readers will, I am sure, disagree with me.
