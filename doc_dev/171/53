   Johnny Carson, a week into using his own
material because of the scriptwriters' strike, quipped on NBC's
``Tonight Show'' that he had seen pictures of his writers on milk
cartons.
   Carson was in fine form Wednesday, entering the second week of
writing his own monologue and material after returning to the air
despite the strike that began March 7.
   He remarked that he had started the day with a bowl of cold
cereal. ``My writers' pictures were on the milk cartons,'' he said,
referring to the cartons that often contain information about
missing children.
   A standard gag about his longtime friend Ed McMahon filled out
the repertoire.
   He joked that McMahon was helping to fight the California water
shortage by taking his scotch and water without water.
   ``That ought to be enough to turn the Kalahari Desert green,''
he said.
   Carson also joked about Attorney General Edwin Meese and the
``kiss and tell'' books about the Reagan administration, Surgeon
General Everett Koop's declaration that tobacco is addictive, plus,
of course, band leader Doc Severinsen's colorful attire.
   Carson, despite the absence of his writers, was cooking. And the
studio audience, unusually loud and boisterous, expressed its
appreciation with yells, whoops, laughter and loud applause.
   He was at his best ad libbing answers to written questions from
the audience and reacting to his guests.
   One viewer asked him when he first ``messed around.'' Carson
replied, ``When I was 16, in the back seat of a '39 Chrysler. It
wasn't much fun. I was alone.''
   Carson's first guest was Dr. Terry Gosliner of the California
Academy of Science in San Francisco. He brought with him a
selection of mollusks. Carson had noted that a bill was before the
California Legislature to make the banana slug the state's official
mollusk.
   The audience, after looking at such mollusks as the slug and the
abalone, cast their vote for the sea hare.
   Other guests were comedian Bill Kirkenbauer and rock musician
Billy Vera.
   Carson returned to the air with ``The Tonight Show'' on May 11
after saying he would write his own material. The show had been in
reruns since the Writers Guild of America walked out over issues of
residual pay for reruns and creative rights.
