   Pope John Paul II's latest trip to southern
Africa will take him to an impoverished region of refugees and
rebels, but he will pointedly avoid segregated South Africa, the
region's economic powerhouse.
   The pope leaves Saturday on his fourth trip to Africa and his
39th abroad. He will go to Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland
and Mozambique, countries that vehemently oppose South Africa but
depend on it for economic survival.
   South Africa dominates communications, trade, transportation and
politics in southern Africa, and its influence will be felt
strongly during the pope's 10-day trip.
   South African firms are supplying such items as transportation,
food, water and health services, broadcasting and emergency
equipment and even papal souvenirs to be used on many of the pope's
stops.
   John Paul, 68, has been critical of South African apartheid
throughout his nearly 10-year-long pontificate.
   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquim Navarro said the pope has not refused
to visit South Africa and he may visit in the future. ``But neither
all the local bishops nor the pope himself consider this an
opportune moment,'' he said.
   Navarro said any South Africa stopover during this visit would
``lose the pastoral tone of the trip.''
   His trip will allow the Vatican to explore new opportunities for
the Roman Catholic Church elsewhere in the region. Orthodox Marxism
is weakening, and communist countries like Mozambique have decided
to return confiscated church properties and to tolerate religious
education. Catholicism has experienced its most rapid recent growth
in Africa.
   John Paul plans to jump immediately into the troubled area with
a keynote address Saturday evening to the bishops of the region,
who are meeting in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare.
   Officials say about 6 million refugees have been displaced in
the area by fierce fighting in the former Portuguese colonies of
Angola and Mozambique and regional conflicts in other southern
African nations.
   The United States has been sponsoring peace talks on southern
Africa that would bring independence to Namibia, a pullout of South
African troops from that country and a gradual withdrawal of about
50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   On the Indian Ocean coast, a 13-year-old civil war in Mozambique
has turned into a disaster, devastating the countryside, halting
agriculture and starving millions of people. It has caused a human
tidal wave of almost 1 million refugees fleeing to camps in
Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Malawi and South Africa.
   The conflict pits the Mozambican National Resistance Movement _
a group that says it is anti-communist _ against Mozambique's
Marxist government. The State Department estimates 100,000
civilians have been killed in the past two years.
   Throughout his visit, John Paul will meet refugees and maimed
victims of the regional conflicts.
   He also will visit the dioceses of Gaborone in Botswana and
Manzini in Swaziland, which are directly dependent on South African
bishops. In Lesotho, more than 1 million South Africans are
expected to cross into the country when the pope beatifies French
missionary Joseph Gerard in a step toward sainthood.
   The king of Lesotho, Moshoeshoe II, is Catholic, as is 40
percent of its 1.8 million population. The visit to Lesotho, one of
the world's poorest countries, is expected to be financed by South
African donations.
   At his first stop in Zimbabwe, John Paul will be greeted by
President Robert Mugabe, a Jesuit-educated Marxist who often has
spoken about his own Catholicism and who received church backing
when he was fighting Rhodesia's white rulers in the 1970s.
   The church has spoken out against alleged atrocities by Mugabe's
soldiers in their conflict against dissidents once headed by Joshua
Nkomo. Nkomo's loyalists made peace last December and joined the
government.
   In diamond-rich Botswana early next week, John Paul will be
greeted by President Quett Masire, who is recovering from injuries
incurred when his plane was mistakenly shot down by Angolan troops
while on his way a month ago to a conference in Angola.
   At midweek, the pope will be in Lesotho for the religious
centerpiece of the trip _ the beatification of Father Gerard, whose
grave has become a pilgrimage site.
   After an eight-hour stop in Swaziland on Sept. 16 and a meeting
with 20-year-old King Mswati III, the pope flies to Mozambique,
where he will visit embattled Beira and Nampula, accompanied by the
country's first cardinal, Alexandre dos Santos, who has urged
government dialogue with the guerrillas.
   Because of guerrilla activity, access to Nampula is considered
relatively safe only by air.
