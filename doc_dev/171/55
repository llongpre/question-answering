<HEAD>Court Overrules Botha's Decision To Halt Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Supreme Court today overruled South
African President P.W. Botha's order to halt the murder trial of six
soldiers charged in the stabbing death of a black activist.
   It marks the second time in four months that Namibia's highest
court has overturned a decision by Botha to grant immunity to
soldiers accused of murder in Namibia, also known as South-West
Africa.
   A three-judge panel said the soldiers of Namibia's South
African-led army will have to stand trial for the Nov. 30, 1986,
killing of Immanuel Shifidi.
   Those accused are four white officers _ two colonels, a
commandant and a lieutenant _ and two black enlisted men, a corporal
and a private.
   Shifidi, 56, was stabbed fatally at a rally outside Windhoek
staged by the legal political wing of the South-West African
People's Organization.
   Shifidi was a founding member of the organization, which has
fought a 23-year bush war for independence from South African
administration. The organization's military wing is outlawed.
   Namibia's attorney general has said the soldiers arranged for 54
black soldiers to dress in civilian clothes and disrupt the rally in
Katutura, a black township outside Windhoek, the capital.
   The six pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and public
violence. But before the trial could begin, Botha last March invoked
a section of South Africa's Defense Act that empowers him to grant
immunity to any soldier for any action committed ``in good faith ...
in connection with the prevention or suppression of terrorism in any
operational area.''
   Harmut Ruppel, a lawyer representing the Shifidi family, has said
there is no evidence Shifidi was a pre-selected target for
assassination. He said it appears the soldiers sought to discredit
the guerrilla organization and intimidate its supporters by
provoking violence at its rally.
   The Supreme Court ruled Botha's order was invalid, but did not
disclose its reasons.
   On Dec. 15, it ruled against Botha in a similar case, arguing the
president did not present important evidence. Botha had granted
immunity to four soldiers accused of beating to death a black man in
northern Namibia.
   South Africa has agreed to begin implementing independence in
Namibia on April 1, leading to elections in November.
   In other developments:
   _South African and Namibian officials set up checkpoints Monday
to monitor cross-border movements. Previously, no identity documents
were required when traveling between South Africa and Namibia.
   _Namibia's South African-led army Sunday demobilized a battalion
made up mostly of troops from the Bushman tribe known for its
extraordinary tracking skills. The Bushmen, part of 201 Battalion,
were used to track guerrillas in the rugged bush of northern
Namibia, where most of the fighting took place.
