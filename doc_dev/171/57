   Namibia celebrated its first day of
independence Wednesday with a joyful multi-racial parade, and
President Sam Nujoma stressed the need for economic development if
the country is to achieve democratic ideals.
   ``We have inherited a lopsided economy ... Two-thirds of our
people are very poor,'' and 30 percent are unemployed, Nujoma told
an overflow crowd of more than 30,000 Namibians and hundreds of
foreign dignitaries.
   All-night parties and tribal dancing followed the lowering of
the South African flag at the sports stadium just after midnight.
Namibians cheered as the red, green and blue banner of their newly
independent country was raised in its place, marking the end of 75
years of South African rule.
   The 72-member National Assembly elected in November was sworn
in, and thousands lined the streets again just after dawn as a
3-mile-long parade made its way to the stadium where Nujoma spoke.
   Forty-one of the legislators belong to Nujoma's South-West
Africa People's Organization, the guerrilla movement that waged a
23-year war against South African rule and then captured the most
votes in November's balloting.
   Black women from the Herero tribe, wearing colorful ankle-length
Victorian dresses and headdresses, marched in front of white
teen-agers twirling batons down Kaiser Street, which will be
renamed Independence Avenue.
   The floats depicted the country's ethnic diversity. Primitive
Bushmen and modern bands were carried along on the back of flatbed
trucks to the stadium. The speeches were followed by singing and
dancing that lasted into the night.
   Many young blacks cheered loudly when Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat, his car blocked by the parade,
stepped out and walked a few steps along the route before slipping
into a hotel.
   Between the festivities and state dinners, dozens of foreign
leaders took the oportunity to discuss issues.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk met with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. It was the first meeting between a
South African president and a member of the Soviet government since
relations were broken 34 years ago over South Africa's system of
racial segregation.
   De Klerk also met Yugoslavian President Janez Drnovsek and
Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson. South African Foreign
Minister Pik Botha described the contacts as ``South Africa's
return to international acceptability.''
   Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos. They discussed a possible
cease-fire in the Angolan civil war, where the United States and
the Soviet Union back opposing sides.
   To coincide with independence, the United States lifted economic
sanctions against Namibia. The sanctions were imposed against South
Africa to protest apartheid, but they extended to Namibia while it
was under South Africa's control.
   The two superpower ministers also had separate meetings with
Nelson Mandela, the deputy president of the African National
Congress.
   Nujoma's focus on economics before an audience of international
decision-makers was seen as an indication of the country's need for
an infusion of money to balance its budget and meet the
expectations that independence has created for so many black
citizens.
   Unemployment is disproportionately suffered by the black
majority and was exacerbated by the return last year of more than
40,000 exiles. Business and industry are concentrated in the hands
of whites, who make up just 6 percent of the population.
   Nujoma, an avowed socialist during his 30 years in exile, made
no reference to that ideology during his speech, but he repeatedly
mentioned the necessity of private capital and investment to
strengthen the Namibian economy.
   Namibia has an annual per capita income of about $1,000 a year,
one of the highest in Africa. But this is partly based on South
African aid, which is ending. The semi-desert country has good
infrastructure and profitable mining, fishing and agriculture
industries, controlled by whites.
   The country of more than 1.3 million people faces a $191 million
deficit this year on a budget of a little more than $766 million.
   South Africa captured Namibia from the Germans in 1915 and
agreed to give up its control last year as part of a complicated
deal also involving Angola and Cuba.
   In return for independence, Cuba withdrew troops backing the
Angolan government against guerrillas and South African fighters.
Namibia had also been known as South-West Africa.
   Chester Crocker, the former U.S. assistant secretary of state
for African affairs who worked out the deal, said Wednesday its
success showed there is hope for peace in all of southern Africa.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak spoke as chairman of the
Organization of African Unity, and like Nujoma he focused on the
economy.
   ``Political freedom cannot be sustained without economic
development,'' said Nujoma. He said the lessening of tensions
between East and West is a positive global development and said he
hoped the rich countries of the world will not now build a ``new
iron curtain'' between north and south that would lead to ``the
marginalization of Africa.''
