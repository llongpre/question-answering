The deep rumble made by one elephant talking to another is a sound which,
once heard, is impossible to forget. I had come across it before, sitting on
a high bank above the River Ruaha in Tanzania and looking down on an
extended family group of elephants at sunset.
Lit by the fiery orange of the last light of the day, they drank and
browsed, played and greeted one another, totally relaxed and at peace. I had
even had the privilege of feeling it during an elephant back safari in the
Okavango Delta, for that rumble sends the whole body of the elephant
quaking.
But the biggest surprise came during a walk in Zambia when the same rumble
reached me unexpectedly from just the other side of a dense thicket. We left
the termite mound we were inspecting and withdrew quietly and quickly,
keeping the elephants upwind and leaving them to their own devices.
African safari companies are becoming increasingly bold and imaginative in
the methods by which they encourage their clients to come close to wildlife
and to appreciate their surroundings, rather than simply to concentrate on
seeing and photographing the large or dangerous mammals. The use of open
vehicles with a thin canopy and neither sides nor doors in southern Africa
is a world away from the enclosed mini-buses employed in east Africa but an
even more significant step forward, literally, is a walking safari.
At first, forsaking a vehicle in the bush feels about as crazy as abandoning
a life raft in the open sea. But there is no doubt that walking is one of
the most exciting ways of enjoying the bush.
You may not come away with the greatest photographs of larger animals,
because they tend to be more wary of people on foot, but your appreciation
of the smells, the space and simply the feel of the place will remain in the
memory.
Zambia has long been considered Africa's walking mecca, for this activity
has been a major feature of safaris here for many years (try Twickers
World). But the walking opportunities in other countries are growing rapidly
as governments alter park rules to permit them and as safari guides gear
themselves up to this new discipline.
Richard Bonham (booked through Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions) guides
walks in the Selous Game Reserve in southern Tanzania and it is possible
that this opportunity will be extended to other parks in that country
especially now that a regular air charter has been established - contact
Wildlife Safari. Good walking is also available in Botswana, Zimbabwe and
South Africa. Safari Consultants and Cazenove &amp; Loyd Safaris are among
others who offer this opportunity.
Alternatives to walking, which avoidmotors, are also growing in popularity.
Horse-riding safaris, mainly for those who ride regularly, are available in
Botswana, Kenya and South Africa. (Cazenove &amp; Loyd Safaris). You do not have
to be a regular elephant rider to enjoy an elephant back safari in
Botswana's Okavango Delta, though, and this experience, offered by Ker and
Downey, enables visitors to experience the joys of travelling through the
Delta aboard the mammalian equivalent of an all-terrain bus.
There are new opportunities to watch gorillas in Uganda which has seen a
regeneration of its tourist industry. Not only does it have gorillas,
together with a range of other primates, but some of the most picturesque
national parks in Africa and good walking in the Ruwenzori Mountains. Try
Abercrombie and Kent, Twickers World and African Explorations.
And then there are the opportunities available in the new South Africa. By
the increasingly exacting standards of Western Europe, some safaris on offer
here are quite dated. If you are looking for a single night in an
air-conditioned safari camp, with game drives evening and morning during
which you might experience, as I did, radio-linked drivers relentlessly
pursuing the Big Five in order to provide you with a certificate and a free
T-shirt, then Mala Mala is for you (Rattray Reserves).
If, on the other hand, you are looking for rather more from your African
experience - starlit nights in the bush, peaceful and unobtrusive game
drives - and a good guide then you are probably looking for a tailor-made
itinerary offered by many of the smaller operators such as African
Explorations, Art of Travel and Safari Consultants.
But what South Africa does offer, in greater measure than probably any other
African country, is the chance of independent travel. With its excellent
infra-structure, accommodation and services and with its amazingly rich
variety of landscapes and wildlife, it is well worth investigating. Namibia,
just over the border, is also an exciting destination for the independent
traveller. Try Sunvil for a fly-drive and assistance with an itinerary.
For the more rugged, Safari Drive will provide a fully equipped Land Rover,
complete with all camping equipment including a tent pitched on the
roofrack, to enable you to travel through Botswana and Zimbabwe on roads
suitable only for four-wheel drive vehicles.
If independent travel is not for you, but you are looking for something
special, there is a growing list of safari operators, such as Abercrombie &amp;
Kent and Safari Consultants, who have wildlife tours led by specialists from
Britain and Africa.
Other safaris include those concentrating on photography or ornithology (try
Hartley's Safaris) while Art of Travel provides the chance to take a
painting and drawing and even a wildlife writing safari.
