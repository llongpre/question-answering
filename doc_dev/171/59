IT IS somewhere between the hour of late afternoon tea and early evening
cocktails. Pen in hand, viennoiseries and a cup of Assam summer flush beside
me, I sit writing in quiet contemplation in the lounge of Amsterdam's Amstel
Inter-Continental Hotel.
Like most of the world's truly luxurious establishments, the Amstel's
extravagances are discreet. Waiters do not hover here, but appear from
nowhere at opportune moments. There is a tinkling piano at the far end of
the glass-roofed lounge, but it tinkles very softly. There are polished
wooden floors, thick carpets, potted palms, gleaming period furniture and
crystal chandeliers. None of it, though, interferes with the room's prime
attraction, its magnificent river-side view of the boats, quays and barge
traffic on the Amstel River.
Upstairs there is more of the same extravagance. Invisible, a butler hangs
about night and day waiting for me to ring my bedside buzzer. My room is
full of rich fabrics, objets d'art, a private bar of cut-glass decanters,
cabinets concealing VCR, CD, fax and sundry other unsightly machines. In the
marbled bathroom there are Hermes toiletries, towels of a size I get lost
in, huge bathtub fittings of ornate and gleaming complexity.
And should I decide to order one of the Amstel's Rolls-Royces or its private
launch for a whirl around town, there is a telephone by the toilet.
This, I am tempted to say in the luxurious idleness of the moment, is what
travel is all about. Why not, if one can afford it, gad about the world
surrounded by crystal and polished wood, well-mannered receptionists and
skilled waiters? Why bother, money being no object, with services that are
anything less than the finest?
But even as I peruse the evening's dinner menu, my eye drawn excitedly
onwards by scallops in truffled ravioli to a bouillabaise of Brittany
lobsters, a calmer, interior voice calls me to order.
This is not travel, it says, so much as mobile self-indulgence, a mere
pandering to the senses in a place other than home. This kind of travel does
not make a vast distinction between one destination and another. What I am
doing in Amsterdam I could equally be doing in any luxury hotel anywhere on
the globe.
Travel is one activity in which the large bank account and the smoking
credit card act as great levellers: the more you spend, the higher the
standard of international service you will receive - and the more the
services in one country will resemble those in another. In its cosmopolitan
refinement the Amstel is similar to the Imperial in Vienna, the Mandarin
Oriental in Hong Kong, or the Taj in Bombay. Even the quays and barges of
the Amstel River cease to be real quays and barges, but become simply an
exotic backdrop to the real business at hand - luxury.
If the aim of travel is to enjoy the great variety of life the world has to
offer, serious wealth can be a serious obstacle. It tends to cut the
traveller off from the world which, in theory, he has set out to explore. I
have no fetish for seediness, gave up back-packing years ago, and
occasionally enjoy the luxury of a top-class hotel. But whether they are of
any interest in themselves or not - and often they are - I find that small,
modest, local hotels allow me a much closer and immediate touch with the
world around.
What applies to hotels applies to other aspects of travel. Ultimately, there
is no correlation between the amount of money you spend on a trip and the
amount of satisfaction you get out of it. What counts in travel, as in most
other endeavours, is not the amount of money you spend, but how you spend
it. The best things in life are not always free, but neither are they always
the most costly.
Often the most expensive restaurants in town are used only by wealthy
tourists, while some of the best local meals and atmosphere are to be found
in places with plastic tablecloths.
Book yourself a holiday in an expensive and isolated beach resort and you
may come home tanned and relaxed, but it will not really have mattered which
country you were in. More isolating still are luxury cruises. The prospect
of sailing into the Caribbean sunset surrounded by high-density wealth and
boredom is dismaying.
Even roughing it can have its problems. Travel over the Kalahari, up the
Amazon or along the Silk Road with a luxury tour company that promises to
pamper you with all the comforts of home in the wilds, and you may well find
the wines excellent and the company convivial. On the other hand, you might
as well have stayed at home.
In some cases, conspicuous wealth can be a positive disadvantage. Walk
around sporting expensive clothing, watches or optical equipment in the
streets of some of the world's poorer countries and you will not only
distance yourself from the majority of people; you may also be setting
yourself up for a mugging or worse. And as tourist killings in various
places have shown, the urban jungles of the developed world are by no means
safer.
But enough carping about luxury travel. Money is, after all, the stuff that
makes travel possible, the only item besides a passport that is essential.
Without it you stay firmly grounded in one place. There are endless travel
projects that simply cannot be realised without lots of money. Scads and
oodles of it.
I may not like the idea of sailing the Caribbean in a luxury cruise liner,
but I would love to sail it on my own with a few friends. We could try
piling into an 8ft inflatable rubber dingy and doing St Lucia, Martinique
and Tobago on the cheap, but frankly I would prefer a 36ft ketch.
Other of my own travel fantasies that require a certain minimum of costly
physical back-up include: the use of a Toyota Landcruiser and the time to
slowly demolish it on the back-roads of Namibia and Botswana; the hire of a
helicopter and pilot for glacier skiing in the Canadian Rockies; a private
expedition to Antarctica so I do not have to join a party of concerned
individuals all wearing red parkas and being lectured to death on green
issues.
Money, though, can also buy travel expertise that is much needed. I would
love to wander into the Karakoram and Pamir mountains of central Asia. I
would also love to wander out again. At times like these a little moneyfor
guides and interpreters might not be amiss.
There are also times when I would like to know just why this Etruscan vase
or that Buddhist stupa is of such significance. Having a cultural or
historical expert's explanation could make all the difference on a trip,
say, to Asia minor or Japan, and there are high-quality tours that cater to
just that kind of need. And just how am I going to navigate that ketch in
the Caribbean? Alpine para-gliding, underwater diving, salt-water kyaking -
in any kind of specialist travel activity, technical instruction is
essential.
There is, in fact, no end to the kinds of ways in which money can improve
travel. It can buy privacy and seclusion in a crowded world. No matter how
alluring they are, I avoid places if there is no escape from tourist hordes.
It can satisfy the interests that travel develops - if I could afford it, I
would fill my house with beautiful carpets and ceramics from around the
world. And it can buy comfort.
I may not be strong on luxury hotels, but travel itself can sometimes be
trying. Given a few hundred thousand in my bank account, I would never
travel anything but first-class.
