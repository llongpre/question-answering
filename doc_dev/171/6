   Voters stood in long lines under
pouring rain Saturday to vote for a new Parliament for Botswana,
one of the few African nations with regular, multiparty elections.
   The conservative Botswana Democratic Party was expected to
retain its comfortable majority. It has governed this diamond-rich
country since independence from Britain 23 years ago and supervised
a capitalist economy that has made Botswana one of Africa's most
prosperous states.
   Eight political parties contested the elections. The polls
closed at 7 p.m. but final results were not expected until Sunday.
   There were no reports of turnout. About 360,000 people over the
age of 21 were eligible to vote.
   It was the sixth general election in this landlocked country in
southern Africa country since independence in 1966.
   The Democratic Party, now led by President Quett Masire, has won
all the elections. It held 28 of the 34 seats in the former
Parliament.
   The socialist Botswana National Front held five seats and
controls the city council in Gaborone, the capital of this nation
of 1.2 million people.
   The Botswana People's Party had one parliamentary seat, which it
was expected to lose. The other five parties were not expected to
win any seats.
   Masire's party was expected to maintain its advantage because of
Botswana's booming economy, which has grown at least 10 percent
annually through the 1980s.
   Diamonds from the Kalahari Desert, along with cattle ranching,
provide most of the wealth.
   When Botswana gained independence it was among the world's 20
poorest nations with a per capita annual income of less than $100.
Today the average yearly income is more than $1,000, one of the
highest in Africa.
   On a continent crippled by foreign debt, Botwana's government
has spent cautiously. The country has foreign reserves in excess of
$2 billion.
   Masire, who has been president since 1980, has avoided large,
expensive public works projects and his administration concentrated
on small-scale development.
   In foreign affairs, his government has been critical of South
Africa's policies of racial discrimination, but it has kept close
business ties with its powerful southern neighbor.
   Botswana's army has never fought a battle, even though the
country is surrounded by such tumultuous lands as South Africa,
Namibia, Angola and Mozambique.
   The Botswana National Front has said it can win seats in larger
towns where jobs and houses are in short supply. The front also
claims Botswana's wealth has not reached ordinary workers and
declaried it would establish more social welfare programs.
