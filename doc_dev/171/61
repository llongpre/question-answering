   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ The people of Africa's last
colony, war-weary and deeply skeptical after 22 years of fighting,
see major obstacles to independence despite South African proposals
to withdraw.
   South Africa joined an Angolan war cease-fire Aug. 8, said it
will pull out of Angola by Sept. 1, and tentatively plans to begin
withdrawing Nov. 1 from neighboring South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia.
   South Africa has offered to grant Namibia independence on June 1
if Cuba agrees to remove its 50,000 troops from Angola by then.
   Namibia has been ruled by Germans and South Africans for more
than a century, and most of its people are aching for peace and
independence.
   But they have had their hopes repeatedly raised and dashed ever
since the U.N. Security Council in 1978 passed Resolution 435
calling for Namibian independence and U.N.-supervised elections.
   ``The words we are hearing today are the same words we heard 10
years ago,'' said Danny Tjongarero, a spokesman for the legal
poltical wing of the South-West Africa People's Organization. ``I'd
like to be optimistic, but South Africa has proved ingenious in
finding excuses to block Namibian independence.''
   SWAPO's outlawed guerrilla movement has been fighting since 1966
to win independence for the mineral-rich territory, which is larger
than France and West Germany combined but has only 1.3 million
residents. SWAPO is considered likely to win independence elections
due to its strong support in the north, where most of the
population is concentrated.
   South Africa calls SWAPO a terrorist organization intent on
establishing a Marxist state. Many Namibians doubt South Africa's
sincerity in proposing elections within a year that are likely to
lead to SWAPO government.
   South Africa, with backing from the United States, argues that
Namibian independence must be linked with the Cuban withdrawal from
Angola.
   The Cubans support Angola's Marxist government in the
13-year-old Angolan war, while the United States and South Africa
aid the UNITA rebel movement.
   South Africa, Cuba, Angola and U.S. mediators plan to hold more
talks the week of Aug. 22 in a bid to establish a date for the
Cuban withdrawal and independence for Namibia. Without an
agreement, Namibian independence plans appear headed for another
derailment.
   Namibian leaders have been excluded from the peace talks and
have been briefed by the South Africans only after proposals and
agreements have been announced.
   ``We know all the participants in the talks still have tricks up
their sleeve,'' @said Andreas Shipanga, a black Cabinet minister in
Namibia's multiracial interim government, established in 1985 to
pave the road for independence.
   Asked if he thought Namibia would be independent by June 1,
Shipanga said: ``I'd like to hope so, but I don't believe so.''
   South Africa has contributed to the skepticism by sending
conflicting signals about its intentions in Namibia.
   South African President P.W. Botha paid a rare visit to Namibia
in April and reiterated his government's commitment to white
``group rights,'' which allow for ethnically based political
structures and segregated schools and hospitals.
   Botha also extended the powers of Louis Pienaar, the territory's
appointed admistrator general. Most Namibians condemned the actions
and said they show South Africa intends to maintain a firm grip on
the territory it has administered since capturing it from Germany
in 1915.
   The League of Nations in 1920 authorized South Africa to govern
the territory, but the League's successor, the United Nations,
revoked the mandate in 1966.
   South Africa's offer to grant independence June 1 marks the
first time it has set a target date for leaving Namibia.
   But South Africa also raised several unresolved questions, such
as who will help pay Namibia's bills and guarantee its loans once
South Africa departs.
   The announcement caught many in Namibia by surprise. Some say a
sudden rush to independence could lead to chaos in a territory that
has more than 40 political parties and 11 ethnic groups ranging
from the nomadic Bushmen to a 20,000-strong German community.
   ``The whites are very worried and you will see an exodus to some
extent,'' said Kosie Pretorius, a Cabinet minister and head of the
all-white National Party. ``We are concerned about the economy,
about losing our cultural identity and about being dominated by a
black majority government.''
   When it appeared Namibia was close to independence in 1978,
about 25,000 whites, or 25 percent of the white population, fled
the territory. Most went to South Africa.
   The 75,000 remaining whites make up only 6 percent of the
population, but they pay almost 90 percent of the personal income
taxes and run the mining industry, the country's largest source of
revenue.
   ``We can't afford to scare whites out of Namibia and open
ourselves to destabilization,'' said Moses Katjiuongua, a black
Cabinet minister.
   ``Independence will create its own problems, but we can't go
backwards now,'' he said. ``We've already had too many
frustrations.''
