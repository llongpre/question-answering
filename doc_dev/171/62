THE MORAL FOUNDATIONS OF MARKET INSTITUTIONS By John Gray Institute of
Economic Affairs, Pounds 7.95
What should inspire post-Thatcher Conservatives - and their allies abroad?
Autonomy, free markets, and an enabling welfare state, argues John Gray, an
Oxford political theorist. In this powerful Institute of Economic Affairs
tract, he combines all three to map out a plausible middle ground for
political debate in the 1990s. With most of today's politicians - left,
right and centre - desperately searching for such terrain, he is playing to
a packed audience.
Gray is that rare bird: the polemical moderate. The 'ruinous failure' of
state socialism, the 'mirage' of egalitarianism, the 'blind alley' of market
socialism, the 'illusions' of libertarianism - successive chapters shatter
each in turn. Gray's political sympathies lie unambiguously with the right,
but his strictures on the limits of markets and the importance of welfare
will cause many an IEA patron to blanch.
The promotion of human autonomy is, for Gray, the end of politics. But
autonomy is more than freedom - the 'negative liberty' of classical liberals
and conservatives. To be valuable, autonomy requires both capacities for
choice on the part of the individual and a range of worthwhile options in
his or her cultural environment. 'In the absence of this,' claims Gray,
'autonomy wanes, and the lives of individuals become the poorer, however
many choices they make.'
Accordingly, free markets are ethically justified as enabling devices for
the protection and enhancement of autonomy - since without them, the ability
of individuals to act upon their own goals, values and knowledge is
diminished. But markets alone are not enough. If worthwhile choices are to
be available to all, the state has to provide public goods for all. The
state also has to satisfy the 'basic needs' of individuals through an active
welfare and cultural policy - where markets, families, charities and other
non-state institutions fail to do so.
What are these 'basic needs'? They are needs whose satisfaction is essential
to the possibility of a worthwhile life. For the most part, they are also
capable of complete satiation. The latter feature is critical: for most
basic needs, writes Gray, 'once they are met, the content of the welfare
claim which guarantees their satisfaction is exhausted'. So needs, not
rights or justice, justify the claims of individuals on the state.
Hence the welfare state. But Gray's Leviathan is small and tame. It will
supplement, not replace, private provision. It will consume only about a
quarter of the national product, and not be a racket for the middle classes.
It will deliver as far as possible through market mechanisms, using vouchers
and the like. And its structure will conform to the principle of
subsidiarity, 'with functions being devolved to the lowest feasible and
desirable level of government'.
None of this cuts much ice with the remnants of the Thatcherite right. In
accompanying commentaries, Chandran Kukathas, of the University of New South
Wales, and Patrick Minford, the monetarist economist, defend negative
liberty - freedom from coercion - as a goal in its own right, and dismiss
'basic needs' as hard to define, and where defined, ruinously expensive to
meet.
Gray's response is persuasive. Freedom, he argues, has little value on its
own. Its chief value is the contribution it makes to autonomy - an autonomy
which involves far more than the mere absence of coercion by others. As for
basic needs, they necessarily vary across cultures and societies - to lead a
worthwhile life, the Kalahari bushman and the urban professional require
different things. Yet allowing for that, and the impossibility of precise
mathematical objectivity in such matters, a 'reasoned public discourse'
ought to generate consensus on the content of such needs.
Gray may place too much faith on the power of 'reasoned discourse': propose
reducing state spending to a quarter of the national product, and the
ensuing debate will be anything but reasoned. Beyond lauding subsidiarity -
a difficult principle to apply, as the European Community is discovering
painfully - he also has little to say about the organisation of his limited
government. Yet the issue affects his argument at every turn, with
constitutional reform moving up the agenda of Britain's political class
through concern for just that autonomy which he is seeking to promote.
A related caveat is entered by Raymond Plant, coming from the left in the
third of the commentaries. It may indeed be possible to reach broad
consensus on basic needs, but it is far from evident that such needs, taken
together, can be met completely within available resources. Gray himself
concedes the expense of many basic health needs - particularly those
relating to ageing; and that is even before aggregating them with
entitlements to education, training, housing, defence and so on.
Yet if basic needs cannot be met completely, then a debate about
distribution and fairness takes over - and the rules for conducting it
become crucial. As Plant notes, governments all too often fall victim to
interest group pressures in relation to the provision of basic services
because of their unwillingness to face the fact of scarcity, and the
consequent imperative to gauge 'a reasonable degree of entitlement given
limited resources'.
Politics evidently still has a controversial life ahead of it.
