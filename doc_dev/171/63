PARISIANS 'should realise the French provinces are not Kamtchatka or the
Kalahari desert,' President Mitterrand said recently when he was
inaugurating the TGV high speed rail link from the French capital to Lille.
He was commenting on the guerrilla tactics employed by large parts of the
national civil service in resisting government efforts to shift them from
Paris, in the interest of reducing congestion in the capital and increasing
employment in the rest of the country. The war between Paris and the
provinces goes back at least two centuries, to the French revolution.
First, the Girondins tried to reduce the predominance of Paris over the
provinces, only to be succeeded by the Jacobins, who then centralised the
French state more than the Bourbon kings had ever succeeded in doing. The
most serious attempt to push the pendulum back came only in 1982-83.
Regions were then given a real responsibility for their own economic
development, and some real money (largely from car and property taxes) to
carry it out. But 10 years of supposed regionalisation has done nothing to
diminish the relative weight of Paris in the economy.
The Ile de France region, in which Paris is situated, is still home to 30
per cent of the country's university students, 40 per cent of its managers,
42 per cent of all its offices, 60 per cent of its researchers and 78 per
cent of the headquarters of France's top 200 companies.
Recent Socialist governments decided on a more dirigiste solution.
During her year (1991-92) as prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson announced a
plan to send 15,000 civil servants out of Paris by 1996 - and double that
number by the end of the century. Two years later only about 2,000 have
departed the capital, grumbling about the extra cost and time spent in
commuting back to Paris.
Certain institutions have not taken their exile from Paris lying down. The
most notable among these has been the Ecole Nationale d'Administration
(ENA), the fount of France's civil service elite.
ENA was ordered to Strasbourg by Mrs Cresson (not herself a former enarque),
where it is being re-housed in a former prison. But ENA's influential
association of former pupils challenged the decision. Earlier this month the
Conseil d'Etat, the country's highest administrative court, ruled that Mrs
Cresson had not followed the proper procedure in moving the school to
Alsace.
But ENA's old boys reckoned without one of their number. Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur has decided to risk the wrath of his patron, Mr Jacques
Chirac (enarque and mayor of Paris) and uphold Mrs Cresson's decision. To be
sure, he could do no less without emptying of all content his pledge for a
new regional planning policy.
The Paris lobby is stronger than ever in the new government. No fewer than
eight ministers are elected from the Paris area. They include Mr Balladur
himself; Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister who also holds (as French
politicians are allowed to do) the presidency of the Ile de France regional
council; and Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister who also presides over
the nearby Hauts de Seine department. But Mr Balladur's partner in coalition
 -the UDF - strongly favours more regionalisation; this Girondist tendency
in the UDF is one of the characteristics which distinguishes it most from
the more Jacobin RPR, the neo-gaullist party of Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac.
More important, Mr Balladur knows that most of the elements in his regional
policy are passive - such as putting a freeze on the closure of public
services and the opening of new supermarkets in the countryside. Other
policies, too, are narrowing his options in regional policy. Planned defence
cuts - which in 1994 involve demobilising 10,000 soldiers, closing a
garrison in Limoges, shutting down the submarine base in Lorient in Brittany
 -have raised a minor furore among local politicians.
His privatisation programme, too, reduces the number of state employees
which the government can direct to the provinces. The Conseil d'Etat, for
instance, raised the same administrative objection to shifting Seita, the
state tobacco making monopoly, from Paris to Angouleme. But since Seita is
now on the privatisation list, it will presumably be eventually allowed to
decide for itself where it wants to sit.
And what, one might ask, is the point of the French state pouring money into
fast transport if it cannot exploit (say) the new TGV link from Paris to
Lille by putting the national patent office in the provincial city?
