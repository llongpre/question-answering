THE Southern African Customs Union meets today in Swaziland to discuss its
future amid increasing indications that South Africa, the senior partner,
wishes to revise the terms of its participation.
Sacu - consisting of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho
 -has existed in various guises for more than 100 years, and has been the
most successful of the regional economic structures in southern Africa.
Domestic fiscal pressures, however, have led over the past year to vocal
protests in South African government circles that the system cannot continue
in its current form.
The root of the complaint is that while South Africa contributes 90 per cent
of all revenue to the customs pool, its share of receipts has declined to 44
per cent from 73 per cent a decade ago. In the case of countries like
Lesotho and Swaziland, these payments amount to more than a third of
national income. In the 1991/2 fiscal year, South Africa paid more than
R4.5bn (Dollars 1.3bn) to other Sacu members, with about 40 per cent going
to the nominally independent homelands in South Africa.
According to Mr Gerhard Croeser, director general of the Department of
Finance, today's meeting is 'just to have an exchange of views, not to make
demands'. South Africa is too close to implementing new transitional
government arrangements for any big policy shifts. Although the discussions
will be technical in nature, they do have important ramifications,
particularly for the future of regional economic co-operation.
As Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, said earlier this month, the
issue is not whether South Africa should be making the payments. 'All I am
saying is that you cannot justify the size of these payments in terms of the
Customs Union. If we were to include other potential members into this
arrangement, our system would run downhill at a rate which would be truly
alarming.'
If the Sacu formula is amended so as to make it possible for other countries
to join - and some have expressed interest - this would cast serious doubts
over the future of the Southern African Development Community as the premier
regional vehicle for economic integration.
The other main item up for discussion will be the terms of South Africa's
revised tariff offer to Gatt in the Uruguay Round. Due to be tabled by the
end of the month, it is likely to involve a cut in the number of tariff
lines from 12,000-plus to about 1,000, and a substantial cut in the average
level of protection. The issue will be how to reconcile South Africa's
tariff policy with the needs of other Sacu members, all of whose economies
are much less developed.
