You do it. I do it. Everybody does it.

According to anthropologist Terry Y. Le Vine, the practice of giving and 
receiving gifts is so universal "it is part of what it means to be human." 
</P>
<P>
As a visiting curator at UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History, Le Vine is 
organizing an exhibit of the roles gifts play in five cultures, including our 
own. "It's something everyone can relate to," explains Le Vine, who has been 
exchanging gifts all her life and scrutinizing the practice professionally for 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Many gifts are quite beautiful (they do reflect the taste of the giver, after 
all), which makes them an obvious choice for display. But gifts are much more 
than art objects, according to Le Vine. In virtually every culture, gifts and 
the events at which they are exchanged are a crucial part of the essential 
process of creating and maintaining social relationships, she says. Presents 
help glue societies together. And even in societies such as ours that maintain 
that giving is better than receiving, gifts are frequently given with the 
understanding that the recipient will reciprocate in time. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit Le Vine is organizing will open in 1993 at the Fowler Museum, then 
travel to four other cities. It will feature gifts favored by five societies: 
the !Kung of Southwest Africa, the Kwakiutl Indians of the Pacific Northwest, 
the Trobriand Islanders of the South Pacific, the people of modern Japan, and 
contemporary North America. Le Vine is also coordinating the writing of a book 
on gift-giving that will bring together the work of experts in anthropology, 
sociology and law. 
</P>
<P>
Le Vine hopes that visitors to the exhibit will share the experience she had 
the first time she looked at UCLA's extensive collection of !Kung artifacts and 
realized, "Hey, all these things on all these storage shelves represent 
people." Although the objects given and received vary from culture to culture, 
gifts are almost always important social tools, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Among the !Kung, for instance, newborns are given a gift that "introduces the 
baby to the idea of giving and receiving." As Le Vine explains, the newborn is 
given necklaces by his or her grandparents. At 6 months or so, the necklaces 
are taken from the child, taken apart and incorporated into new necklaces that 
are then given to people with whom the mother thinks the child should have a 
gift-exchanging relationship. This process of exchanging necklaces and other 
gifts continues throughout the child's lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The gifts exchanged by the !Kung may be evidence of the generosity of the 
giver, the prestige of the recipient or affection between the two, but they 
represent something even more basic as well. As Le Vine points out, the !Kung 
are people whose very lives depend on the uncertain bounty of the Kalahari 
Desert. Relationships with fellow tribesmen in other areas, relationships 
cemented with gifts, are a kind of insurance against the day when your own 
garden fails to bloom and your survival hinges on the hospitality of others. 
Not surprisingly, the first gift was probably food, says Le Vine, citing the 
classic study of gift-giving, Marcel Mauss' "The Gift." 
</P>
<P>
One of the issues that Le Vine and her consultants have been grappling with is 
the difference between a gift and a bribe. The definition is culturally 
relative. "In many cultures, what we would call a bribe is just a way of doing 
business," she says. The Japanese, for instance, often give gifts in 
circumstances Americans would consider inappropriate. It is common practice in 
Japan, for example, to give your surgeon a gift before you go under the knife. 
Among the artifacts Le Vine hopes to include in the exhibit are examples of the 
gorgeous envelopes, in different colors for different occasions, in which the 
Japanese give gifts of money. 
</P>
<P>
Cultures also vary in what they regard as the ultimate gift. "Often it is 
something hard to get," Le Vine says. The relative scarcity of diamonds may 
explain why Americans value them for such important occasions as betrothals and 
anniversaries. Among the Kwakiutl, or Kwakwaka'waka, as members of the 
Northwest tribe prefer to be called, copper was the premier gift after contact 
with Western culture (grease continued to be an important gift as well). 
</P>
<P>
In the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea, the Rolls-Royce of presents is a 
green stone called beku. In Trobriand society, Le Vine explains, a young man 
gives gifts to an older, more powerful man in the hopes of winning his support. 
Such patronage will eventually mean the young man can use land held by the clan 
to raise yams, another important gift among the Trobriand Islanders. This 
process, which proceeds according to a prescribed timetable, typically begins 
with the giving of such relatively modest gifts as fish and culminates in the 
giving of a beku ax blade. "That usually gets to them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"The gift that travels" is another worldwide phenomenon, according to Le Vine. 
One example common in mainstream American culture is the gift that is handed 
down from one generation to the next. A family quilt or a string of pearls that 
passes from mother to daughter functions as an "identity marker," she says. 
"They carry messages of identification with those who have gone before. They 
tell us who we are." 
</P>
<P>
One of the experts involved in the project is Gloria Cranmer Webster, a 
Kwakwaka'waka from British Columbia. She is providing an insider's perspective 
on one of the world's most famous gift-giving rituals, the potlatch. A festive 
occasion at which enormous numbers of gifts are given and sometimes destroyed, 
potlatch has entered the English language as a synonym for excess. But, as Le 
Vine notes, potlatches were, and are, ceremonies that reinforce the social 
hierarchy that is so important to the Northwestern Indian nation. As gifts so 
often do, the number and quality of potlatch goods carry information about the 
underlying status of the giver and the recipient, Le Vine says. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't think of us in the past," Webster told Le Vine. "We're still here. We're 
still doing potlatching. We've been doing it all along." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the gifts presented at potlatches are non-material, such as the right 
to use certain family crests or sing a family song or dramatize family myths 
(symbols of such gifts are often included in "privilege boxes," passed between 
father-in-law and son-in-law in potlatches occasioned by marriages). But 
material things have always been a vital part of the tradition. When Le Vine 
made a recent visit to British Columbia, Webster showed her the upstairs room 
in which the Indian woman was collecting boxes of linens, glassware, dishes and 
other gifts for an upcoming potlatch. 
</P>
<P>
Potlatching was outlawed by the Canadian government in 1884 and not legalized 
until 1951. During that time, it went underground, Webster told Le Vine. 
Webster's father, Daniel, a chief of the Nimpkish tribe, was arrested for 
potlatching in 1921, and the goods he had collected to give, including masks 
and other ceremonial objects, were confiscated. The Canadian government has 
been returning such objects to the Indians if they can show that they will 
provide safe, museum-like places for their preservation. 
</P>
<P>
The giving of gifts proved too close to the heart of being Kwakwaka'waka to 
give up, no matter what the civil law. As a result, one winter during the bad 
old days of the ban, Webster's father and fellow tribesmen "pretended they were 
celebrating Christmas when they were really holding a potlatch."
