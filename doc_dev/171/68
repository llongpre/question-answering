   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
attend independence ceremonies this month in Namibia on an African
trip that could thrust him into negotiations to dismantle racial
segregation in South Africa.
   So far, the State Department is giving few details on what could
turn out to be a nine-day trip to a half-dozen countries.
Spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler announced on Monday only his stop
in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia.
   But preparations were under way for possible visits to Senegal,
Zaire, Botswana, Zambia, Ivory Coast and South Africa, where the
white minority government last month ended a 30-year ban on the
African National Congress and released black leader Nelson Mandela
from prison.
   Baker is going to Windhoek to join with other world leaders as
the former South African colony gains independence and Sam Nujoma,
a former guerrilla leader who spent 30 years in exile, is sworn in
as president.
   Nujoma helped found the South-West Africa People's Organization
in 1960 and led it through a 23-year bush war against South African
rule of Africa's last colony.
   While representing President Bush at the ceremonies, Baker will
have a chance to meet with South African President F.W. de Klerk
and Mandela, but he is unlikely to turn the occasion into a
substantive session about dismantling apartheid in South Africa,
said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition on anonymity.
   Rather, the official told The Associated Press, it is ``highly
likely'' that Baker would have those discussions in Cape Town and
Johannesburg, South Africa, where he would meet with a wide range
of government and opposition leaders.
   The Bush administration has praised de Klerk for the steps he
has taken toward racial reconciliation, while urging him to move
faster. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions designed to punish South Africa
for apartheid remain in place.
   Spokeswoman Tutwiler said the Windhoek stop was the only one
scheduled so far. She said she did know when Baker would leave
Washington or return home.
   ``We don't know anything other than the announcement I just
made,'' she said. ``It could be the only stop he makes, it could be
that other steps are added.''
