   The world's newest nation celebrated
its birth today with parties, tribal dancing and parades, and
ex-guerrilla leaders were sworn in as ministers of the new
government.
   About 25,000 Namibians cheered wildly at a sports stadium as the
South African flag was lowered in Africa's last colony just after
midnight, replaced by the red, green and blue banner of newly
independent Namibia.
   Tens of thousands lined the main street of Windhoek, the
capital, for a three-mile parade.
   ``Africa's last colony is from this hour liberated,'' President
Sam Nujoma said in his inaugural address after U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar swore in the former
guerrilla leader. Nujoma led the 23-year fight to end rule by
neighboring South Africa.
   As a fireworks display lit up the sky, Namibians began impromptu
parties throughout the capital of Windhoek and car horns blared
through the night.
   ``This is beautiful. We are all thrilled. We have waited so long
for this day,'' said Olga Basson as she watched gold and red
fireworks ripping through the night sky.
   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa, who held his hand
across his heart as he watched his nation's flag being lowered,
called for an end to violence in southern Africa.
   ``I stand here tonight as an advocate for peace. The season for
violence has passed for Namibia and the whole of southern Africa,''
de Klerk said.
   ``It is above all a moment for hope. Hope that the future of
this vast and beautiful land will bring peace.''
   As thousands watched the parade, middle-aged black women from
the Herero tribe, wearing colorful ankle-length Victorian dresses
and two-pointed headdresses, marched in front of white teen-age
baton twirlers. Floats depicted the country's ethnic diversity,
including the primitive Bushmen, and modern bands rode flatbed
trucks to the stadium.
   Many young blacks cheered loudly when Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat, his car blocked by the parade,
stepped out and walked a few paces along the side of the parade
before slipping into a hotel.
   Later, the National Assembly was sworn in, and it adopted a coat
of arms with the Namibian motto: ``Unity, Liberty, Justice.''
   Forty-one of the 72 members belong to the South-West Africa
People's Organization, the guerrilla movement that fought South
African rule then captured U.N.-supervised elections in November.
   Seven parties, ranging from black Marxists to right-wing whites,
are represented in the assembly, which wrote a democratic,
Western-style constitution that has earned praise both inside the
country and from abroad.
   De Klerk has pledged to end South Africa's apartheid system of
racial segregation and the date chosen for the ceremony was rich in
symbolic meaning for his country.
   It marked the 30th anniversary of the ``Sharpeville Massacre,''
when 69 unarmed demonstrators were shot and killed in South Africa
while protesting racial segregation laws in a black township south
of Johannesburg.
   Sharpeville was the turning point for the African National
Congress, which broke with decades of nonviolent protest to fight
against South Africa's white-run government.
   ``The day was chosen as a sign of solidarity not only for the
people of Namibia, but also with the people of South Africa,'' said
Hifikepunye Pohamba, home affairs minister in the new government.
   South African black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela drew a
fervent burst of applause when he entered the stadium.
   Others attending included Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and the leaders at
least 12 African nations.
   They used the occasion for behind-the-scenes consultations
throughout the day, with the United States, the Soviet Union and
others holding meetings.
   The huge, arid territory of 1.3 million people on Africa's
southwest coast was a German colony until it was captured by South
Africa during World War I.
   Some whites expressed concern about the new black government,
but said they wanted to support the new nation.
   South Africa agreed in December 1988 to grant independence to
Namibia under a regional peace treaty that also calls for Cuba to
withdraw its 50,000 soldiers from Angola by mid-1991.
   South Africa retains control of Walvis Bay, Nambia's only deep
sea port, which was a British colony before Germany occupied
Namibia. South Africa says the port is part of its territory, but
Namibia is demanding it be incorporated into its boundaries.
