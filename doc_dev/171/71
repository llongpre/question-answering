  [Excerpts] An explosive situation exists in eastern Caprivi 
after details surfaced of an incident involving a strange armed 
force supported by an attack helicopter of unknown origin, which 
apparently attempted to terrorize the Mafwe chief at Linyanti. 
The household of Chief Bonniface Mamili, on the banks of the 
Linyanti River, which forms the border between Namibia and 
Botswana, was allegedly held captive for several hours by armed 
men combing the surrounding areas in search of members of the 
Angolan resistance movement, UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola], while a helicopter equipped with 
weapons circled over the tribal settlement. The president of 
the DTA [Democratic Turnhalle Alliance] in Namibia, Mr. Mishake 
Muyongo, who is presently visiting the eastern Caprivi, 
yesterday described the incident as sufficient proof of SWAPO's 
[South-West African People's Organization] secret missions to 
intimidate political opponents and to fuel chaos in Caprivi 
where SWAPO currently enjoys no political support. 
  Yesterday the Namibian police strongly denied any 
allegations 
of police and army involvement in the alleged incident and 
confirmed that the incident is being investigated at the highest 
level. According to government sources, Minister of Home Affairs 
Lucas Pohamba and Police Inspector General General Raonga Andima 
was kept fully informed yesterday about developments during the 
joint investigation by police, the Intelligence Service, and the 
Defense Force. Yesterday DIE REPUBLIKEIN could not succeed in 
independently confirming the incident but inhabitants and 
community leaders in Katima Mulilo suggested that members of the 
Botswana Defense Force stationed at the Chobe National Park, or 
even a reconnaissance and fighter unit of the MPLA [Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola] army in Angola, could be 
responsible for the incident. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Muyongo said that according to preliminary information 
at 
his disposal, a secret informant of SWAPO notified the police at 
Katima Mulilo that members of UNITA were hiding in the vicinity 
of the chief's residence. In reaction to this information a 
helicopter and at least three land cruiser vehicles full of 
armed "policemen" were sent to the town. The men in the 
vehicles searched the bush around Mr. Mamili's residence in 
military formation after a helicopter circled the house. After 
the unsuccessful search they disappeared and nothing was heard 
from them since. [passage omitted] 
  Inhabitants of Katima Mulilo said yesterday that the 
Botswana 
Air Force operating from the Kasane Airport near Linyanti often 
violates Namibian borders and that these violations are usually 
accompanied by patrols into Caprivi from the Chobe Nature 
Reserve. According to these inhabitants, high-level talks 
recently took place between senior officers of the Namibian 
Police, the Defense Force, and Intelligence, with their 
counterparts from Botswana. The assistant to the secretary 
general of the police, General Martin Pool, yesterday confirmed 
these talks, adding that the group of officers made use of a 
Botswana Air Force helicopter in their investigation. He 
strongly denied, however, that the helicopter entered Namibian 
airspace. [passage omitted]
