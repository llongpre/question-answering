<LEADPARA>  TWICE LAST month the ground at the Nevada Test Site heaved from the elemental
forces unleashed by underground nuclear explosions. One blast was so big that
window washers were warned to stay off the outside walls of high-rise
buildings in Las Vegas, 70 miles away, because the upper stories tend to
sway.;   To anthropologist Hugh Gusterson, these tests mark a crucial rite of
passage for young physicists into the innermost circle of America's nuclear
priesthood.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The tests matter to weapons scientists not only for technical reasons, but
also because they are the 'core rituals' of the laboratory culture," Gusterson
said in a recent telephone interview from his New Mexico office.;   Even with
the demise of the Cold War, the notion of a test moratorium remains taboo in
the nuclear weapons community. Indeed, despite President Bush's recent arms
cut initiative, he still supports underground testing.;   Gusterson cited a
meeting in the summer of 1990 where a junior scientist put up his hand and
asked, "What if the Soviets just stop nuclear testing?";   There was a
profound silence before someone joked, "Well, we'd have to go and do the test
for them." Since then, the Soviets have stopped.;   After interviewing 86
scientists at the Lawrence Livermore laboratory, one of the nation's two
laboratories where weapons are designed, Gusterson concludes that "nuclear
tests do not just produce new weapons. They also produce weapons designers."; 
 He found that Livermore is dominated by an elite of about 100 physicists who
direct the design of new weapons. These physicists, who assign "Third World"
status to the non-weapons divisions at Livermore, attain their esteemed
positions by testing.;   A newly hired physicist will spend years studying the
arcane secrets of warhead design. If he comes up with a new idea and gets it
blessed by the elders, he'll spend further months in an intensive process of
detailed design and fabrication. The cycle culminates in a live test.;   "We
might think of the Nuclear Test Site as sort of a sacred location where only
the elders and novitiates go," Gusterson said.;   At the moment of
consummation, in the fraction of a second before the 5,000 or so parts of a
new bomb design are vaporized, the device creates a temperature hotter than
the sun.;   As one designer recalled, "What I had been looking at on my
computer screen for years all of a sudden showed up in this gigantic movement
of the Earth.";   Reputations rise and fall with the heaving of the Earth. The
tests not only produce knowledge in the form of computer printouts, but also a
more elusive commodity -- a knack for judgment.;   "After enough tests, maybe
15 or so, designers are regarded as elders. Nuclear tests are essential in
establishing the social hierarchy within the laboratory," Gusterson said.;  
The tests invariably follow a common plotline, a voyage through anxiety to
confidence. "Where most of us worry that a nuclear explosion will occur . . .
they worry that it won't," Gusterson said.;   For these "Masters of the
Universe," the ultimate evidence of technical skill is a blast that meets
pretest calculations.;   Gusterson recalled the case of one designer who
achieved a legendary reputation for winning the so-called "yield pool," or the
nuclear testing version of the office football pool. The winner is the one
whose bet comes comes closest to the actual explosive yield of the new
device.;   "He usually gets a pizza," Gusterson said.;   Above all, the tests
are "ritual furnaces" where the bonds of kinship within the laboratory are
forged.;   "They use words like 'euphoria' and 'elation' to describe their
feelings when the test finally happens. They gather together to bask as a
community in the glow of returning data . . . what one designer calls the
moment of 'show and tell,' " Gusterson said.;   But the end of the Cold War
has upset the cloistered rhythm of their work.;   "Like the Kalahari bushmen,
they're in danger of extinction. Like any threatened species, they're trying
to adapt," Gusterson said.;   One idea in fashion is to develop a "Green
Bomb," or a nuclear weapon that can be manufactured without causing all the
radioactive byproducts that have polluted the soil and groundwater at the
laboratories and bomb factories.;   Gusterson pointed out that the budget for
nuclear design and manufacture is scheduled to go up $200 million next year.
Of course, the new materials in the Green Bomb will have to be tested with
underground explosions, marking the triumph of tribalism over a test ban.  </TEXT>
