   Police have seized a van loaded with
military gear and arrested two black men suspected of plotting to
rescue two men alleged to be South African commandos, the Botswana
Press Agency reported.
   The agency said Wednesday that police found a pistol, silencer,
ammunition, two-way radio and wire-cutter in a van belonging to
Johannes Zitha, 29, a South African.
   It said he was arrested Sunday in Francistown, Botswana, where
the two alleged commandos are to go on trial next week in
connection with a cross-border raid in June.
   On Monday, the Botswanan defense attorney for the two white
South Africans was arrested in connection with the alleged escape
plot. The news agency quoted police as saying the attorney, Duncan
Morotsi, was arrested while in possession of unspecified
``undesirable'' items.
   Andrew Matlapeng, a divisional police commander, was quoted as
saying that the wire-cutter may have been intended for use in
trying to rescue the alleged commandos from Francistown Prison.
   The two were captured in June during a cross-border raid by
South African soldiers. They are Johannes Basson, 25, identified by
police as a South African army corporal, and Theodore Hermansen,
identified as a police reservist. Both are charged with attempted
murder, violation of national security laws, and other offenses.
   South African military headquarters confirmed that it sent an
army unit into Botswana on June 20 on an anti-guerrilla mission. It
said the soldiers escaped back into South Africa after a
confrontation with Botswana police in which three policemen were
injured.
   Basson and Hermansen, wearing civilian clothes, were arrested
after the shooting while trying to pass through a roadblock in a
Botswana police car. South African authorities have neither
confirmed nor denied that the two were involved in the cross-border
mission.
   On Wednesday, South African military headquarters denied any
knowledge of Zitha.
   South African forces have staged numerous cross-border raids in
the past on suspected facilities in Botswana and neighboring states
of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla organization
fighting to end white minority rule in South Africa.
