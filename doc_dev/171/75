   This new country's black leaders,
avowed socialists during their long exile, are now looking to
businessmen and foreign investors to help develop the nation.
   The week-old government says it has learned from the mistakes of
Africa's socialist-oriented economies, which have failed even more
dramatically than those in Eastern Europe.
   President Sam Nujoma, in a major economic speech one week ago on
independence day, did not make a single reference to socialism and
promised ``a dynamic role for the private sector.''
   ``We are committed to a mixed economy,'' said Nujoma. ``We look
forward to a good partnership between the state and the private
sector.''
   Less than a year ago, Nujoma and other members of his South-West
Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, were returning from exile
and declaring their ``belief in the moral superiority of socialism
over capitalism.''
   But as independence from South Africa neared, the rhetoric
changed.
   ``I think the leaders were quite impressed with the development
in many parts of the country, especially Windhoek,'' said Rainer
Ritter, a private economist. ``They were coming from poor (African)
countries, and they didn't want Namibia to go the same way.''
   A senior South African official, who requested anonymity, said
SWAPO leaders revised their economic policies after Western nations
said they would not provide aid to a socialist-oriented economy.
The Soviets and former East bloc nations, the main backers of SWAPO
during its war against South African rule, had no money to give.
   All the southern African nations that have relied on state
control of the economy _ Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and
Mozambique _ have suffered economic declines or fallen far short of
their potential. All now are making at least limited attempts to
restructure their economies.
   The one black-ruled capitalist country in the region, Botswana,
has one of the highest growth rates in the world and often is cited
by economists as a model for development.
   Nujoma and his Cabinet, made up mostly of ex-guerrilla leaders
with no experience in managing an economy, stress that the skills
and money of white businessmen and foreign investors are essential
in building Namibia.
   Nujoma has named two white businessmen, Otto Herrigel and Gert
Hanekom, as his ministers of finance and agriculture.
   On independence day, the government announced an agreement with
the British firm Lonrho to build a $150 million sugar refinery that
could create 4,000 jobs in a country where the unemployment rate is
more than 30 percent.
   The huge, arid nation boasts profitable mining, fishing and
farming industries and one of the best economic bases in Africa,
much of it built with money from South Africa, which ruled Namibia
for 75 years.
   The 23-year war between Nujoma's guerrillas and the South
African-led security forces claimed more than 20,000 lives, but was
restricted to the rugged bush in the north.
   The fighting caused only limited damage to roads, schools and
villages.
   Namibia's annual per capita income tops $1,000, a figure only a
handful of Africa's more than 50 nations have reached.
   However, the wealth is disproportionately controlled by whites,
who account for just 75,000 of the country's 1.3 million people.
SWAPO estimates that whites own about two-thirds of private
property and earn about 10 times as much as blacks on average.
   The most pressing economic task for the government will to be
meet rising black expectations without alienating whites, who can
move to neighboring South Africa.
   The Namibian government is facing a deficit of almost $200
million on this year's budget of about $900 million. The foreign
debt is more than $300 million, relatively modest compared to most
nations on the heavily indebted continent.
   So far, Namibia's leading aid donors have been West Germany,
which has agreed to give $59 million, and Britain, which will give
$16 million. The United States has not yet completed an aid
package, but is expected to announce a plan shortly.
   South Africa has cut assistance to Namibia after steadily
reducing its aid in recent years, but South African President F.W.
de Klerk said trade talks and other ties will remain strong.
   Namibia is heavily dependent on South African for imports. More
importantly, South Africa controls Walvis Bay, the only deep-water
port along Namibia's coast.
   Walvis Bay is more than 600 miles from the nearest South African
territory. But the Pretoria government claims ownership based on
Britain's 1884 decision to annex Walvis Bay and make it part of
South Africa's Cape Colony.
   Namibia's constitution claims Walvis Bay as part of the new
nation. South Africa, which has army, naval and air force bases in
Walvis Bay, said it is willing to enter negotiations on the status
of the territory, which has 26,000 residents.
