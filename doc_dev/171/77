currency could help cement country's political independence

THREE and a half years after achieving its independence, Namibia yesterday
took a further step towards full statehood with the launch of its own
national currency, the Namibian dollar.
Although the move is mainly of symbolic importance - the South African rand
will for now remain legal tender in Namibia, with the currencies being used
in parallel at equal value - banks were yesterday expecting a clamour today
for the new notes.
At yesterday's launch ceremony at the Tintenpalast government buildings in
Windhoek, President Sam Nujoma insisted that the new currency would ensure
'that Namibia is not only politically independent, but financially as well.'
For some months the Bank of Namibia, the central bank, has been running a
publicity campaign with the slogan 'The Namibia dollar. Our money. Our
pride.' About Dollars 200m (Pounds 129.8m) of notes will be issued in the
first few days. They depict a famous fighter for independence, Captain
Hendrik Witbooi, on the front.
The launch of the dollar follows another important event this month - an
accord in principle with Pretoria that the port of Walvis Bay would be
handed over to Namibia next February.
In spite of a recession, business is generally happy with the way things
have gone since independence. Mr Abel Gower, executive director of CDM, the
De Beers diamonds subsidiary, comments that life for the company is
'certainly no more difficult than it was in the past'. He adds: 'If Namibia
is to be a model for South Africa, it is very encouraging.'
However, unemployment is high, probably over 30 per cent, crime has risen
and there are concerns about inefficiency and corruption in government.
When a top agriculture official was alleged to have appropriated funds to
help develop a private farm, he was dismissed, but no attempt was made to
prosecute him or recover any money.
But as Mr Gower notes, the problems of Namibia 'are very different from
problems in Africa which have mostly arisen from the pursuit of misguided
economic policies'. The government is operating within a market economy, and
the nationalisation contained in earlier rhetoric of the governing Swapo
party is a distant memory.
Instead, the worries are that the government simply lacks expertise
necessary to run an economy even of its modest proportions - with a
population of 1.4m, gross domestic product is R7bn (Pounds 1.36bn), about 40
per cent of the size of Zimbabwe's economy and two-thirds that of Botswana.
Mr John Kirkpatrick, chairman of Rossing Uranium and former central bank
board member, says: 'There is gross inefficiency in government. There are a
few well-run ministries, but most are disasters.'
A more worrying long-term trend is the deterioration in government finances.
Mr Gert Hanekom, finance minister, has had a difficult task. His tenure has
coincided with a commodity price downturn, crimping tax contributions from
the two main producers, Rossing and CDM, while South Africa, Namibia's main
trading partner, has been deeply mired in recession. Also, the new
government has been under pressure to address the apartheid legacy,
especially in social services.
Mr Hanekom says he shares the concern about the deficit, but believes 'we're
on the verge of reversing this trend'. He says initial projections for the
1994-95 and 1995-96 financial years show the deficit at below 5 per cent.
Such targets are met with scepticism in the business community where Mr
Hanekom is criticised for lack of consultation.
According to Mr Hanekom, the deficit will be contained by keeping
expenditure growth below inflation and improving revenues without lifting
tax rates. He believes an economic upturn will help close the deficit gap,
predicting that emergence from recession may bring GDP growth of 7 per cent
in 1994, moderating to 5-6 per cent in the two following years.
Perhaps the biggest threat to government finances is the size of the civil
service which now employs 63,000, compared with pre-independence levels of
54,000. Businessmen doubt whether the cabinet has the political will to
address the problem.
