   The South African army today raided a
house on the outskirts of the capital, killing four residents who
were burned beyond recognition after an hour-long gunbattle.
   South Africa, which claims that neighboring Botswana harbors
guerrillas hostile to Pretoria, called the victims terrorists. It
said it was responsible for the attack in a statement issued by its
Defense Force in Pretoria.
   The office of President Quett Masire of Botswana said four
people died _ a South African man, two Batswana women, and a third
unidentified woman. The Botswana Press Association quoted Deputy
Police Commissioner Norman Moleboge as saying residents reported
all the occupants of the house were Batswana.
   The president's statement said all were sleeping when the South
Africans attacked in the township of Phiring, known locally as
Tsholofelo. The community lies two miles from the center of the
capital of Gaborone, a border city.
   ``The office of the president strongly condemns this dastardly
attack and murder of innocent people in Botswana by the South
African army,'' said Botswana's statement. ``The office of the
president once again reiterates Botswana's belief that South
Africa's problems cannot be resolved by attacking neighboring
countries such as Botswana and strongly urges the South African
government to engage in meaningful negotiations with the genuine
leadership of the oppressed majority in that country.''
   South Africa's government and economy are controlled by 5
million whites. The country's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs under a system of racial segregation known as
apartheid.
   Pretoria has issued several threats against Botswana in recent
months, accusing it of harboring African National Congress
guerrillas bent on ending white domination in South Africa.
   The Botswana government says it supports the group's goals and
allows its representatives in the country. But Botswana says it
does not let the group launch attacks into South Africa from
Botswana.
   The South African military statement said today's raid was a
follow-up to a shootout near the South Africa-Botswana border
Friday. In that attack, the military said soldiers killed three
suspected terrorists in a running battle near a farm and captured
rifles, machine pistols and hand grenades.
   The operation had not previously been reported.
   In today's shootout, neighbors said they heard sporadic
automatic gunfire, and possibly grenades, for an hour. Two
witnesses reported that the attackers left in a helicopter.
   Moleboge was quoted as saying four people were shot, then set
afire by the attackers, and that gasoline containers were found at
the scene. The Botswana Press Association said it was believed an
explosion may have been caused by a gas cylinder in the house,
which was destroyed.
   The South Africans gave no details on how the occupants of the
house died.
