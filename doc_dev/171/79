   South Africa has agreed to a general
amnesty that is to allow 41,000 Namibian black nationalist
guerrillas and refugees to return home to the territory from camps
in neighboring Angola and Zambia.
   The move is part of an independence plan for Namibia, which South
Africa has ruled for 74 years in defiance of the United Nations and
a 23-year fight for black majority rule.
   President P.W. Botha of South Africa signed the amnesty Tuesday,
paving the way for the repatriation to begin Monday. Some Namibians
will be coming home for the first time in 20 years.
   U.N. officials said they would be airlifting the Namibian
refugees at a rate of 1,000 to 1,400 a day through July.
   In conjunction with the amnesty, Namibia's South
African-installed administrator repealed security laws, including
those allowing detention without trial and empowering Botha to halt
court proceedings against security force members.
   The repeal is a prelude to pre-independence elections in November.
   Louis Pienaar, Namibia's administrator, and U.N. envoy Martti
Ahtisaari had been negotiating the moves for weeks.
   ``The discriminatory and restrictive laws that are to be repealed
represent only a small fraction of those that have existed in this
territory for many years,'' Ahtisaari said.
   He said all 41,000 Namibians returning from Angola and Zambia
will be covered by the amnesty.
   On Monday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees plans to bring
the first 1,374 refugees to the northern towns of Ondangwa and
Grootfontein and the capital, Windhoek, officials said.
   They will include members of the South-West Africa People's
Organization, Namibia's only guerrilla-backed movement.
   SWAPO is favored to win the November elections, though it is
unclear if the organization will capture the two-thirds majority
needed to control a new government.
   Campaigning is to begin July 1, but senior guerrilla leaders have
not said when they plan to come home.
   U.N. and South African officials still must resolve issues
including voter registration procedures and the release of political
prisoners.
   Namibian authorities say they are holding 29 political prisoners.
The guerrilla movement says 201 dissidents were freed recently.
   More than 4,000 U.N. military personnel are in Namibia to monitor
the transition to independence, and Ahtisaari said he would deploy
500 more police monitors.
   South Africa agreed to the U.N. independence plan in a
three-nation regional accord involving the withdrawal of 50,000
Cuban troops helping Angola's government fight right-wing rebels
armed by Pretoria and Washington.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar announced Tuesday that two black African diplomats have
been appointed as senior staff to strengthen the U.N. Namibian
independence operation.
   African front-line states had lobbied intensely for appointment
of an African assistant to give them a stronger voice in the Namibia
operation.
   Botswana's U.N. ambassador, Legwaila Joseph Legwaila, was named
an assistant secretary-general to serve as deputy special
representative for Namibia.
   B.A. Clark, a former Nigerian ambassador, was the U.N. Transition
Assistance Group's special representative in Luanda to improve
liaison with Angolan authorities.
