   The Botswana Democratic Party, which
has governed this diamond-rich nation since independence in 1966,
retained a comfortable majority in Parliament, according to partial
returns Sunday.
   The party captured all 19 districts where final results were
available for the elections, and it appeared set to add to its
majority in Parliament. Prior to Saturday's balloting, the party
held 28 of the 34 seats.
   The left-leaning Botswana National Front was expected to retain
at least four of its five seats. The Botswana People's Party lost
its lone seat.
   This peaceful, southern African nation is one of only a few on
the continent to hold regular, multiparty elections. Saturday's
polls were the sixth since Botswana gained independence from
Britain 23 years ago.
   President Quett Masire and his Democratic Party retained their
comfortable majority on the strength of Botswana's surging
capitalist economy, which has grown at least 10 percent annually
throughout the 1980s.
   Diamonds from the Kalahari Desert, along with cattle ranching,
account for most of the wealth in this thinly populated desert
nation of 1.2 million.
   When Botswana gained independence it was among the world's 20
poorest nations, with a per capita annual income of less than $100.
Today the average yearly income is more than $1,000, one of the
highest in Africa.
   At a time when many African nations are crippled by huge foreign
debts, Botswana's government has spent cautiously and has foreign
reserves in excess of $2 billion, enough to pay for more than two
years of imports.
   Masire, president since 1980, has avoided expensive public works
projects and concentrated on small-scale development.
   The opposition National Front argued that Botswana's wealth has
not reached the ordinary workers and called for an increase in
public spending and the creation of more social programs.
