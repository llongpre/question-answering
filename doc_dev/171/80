   Western governments could bring
apartheid ``much nearer its death'' by imposing stiff economic
sanctions on South Africa, British opposition leader Neil Kinnock
said Wednesday.
   The Labor Party leader mentioned no names, but since his arrival
in southern Africa last Friday he has attacked Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and President Reagan for opposing sanctions.
   Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher argue that South African blacks and
neighboring black-ruled states would suffer most from such measures.
   Kinnock is on a four-nation tour and met on Wednesday with
President Quett Masire at the end of a three-day visit to Botswana,
which borders South Africa.
   ``I am greatly impressed by the progress in this peaceful,
prosperous democracy,'' he said of Botswana, which has held regular
elections and built one of Africa's fastest-growing economies in 21
years of independence.
   He praised Botswana for ``demonstrating immense bravery'' by
taking a strong stand against South Africa and its apartheid
policies but acknowledged it would be ``economic suicide'' for the
landlocked country to impose sanctions on its southern neighbor.
   He added, however: ``If faraway nations that are much stronger
and much less tied to South Africa showed the same bravery,
including the imposition of sanctions ... then apartheid would be
much nearer its death.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Kinnock also condemned South Africa's recent military raids into
Botswana and repeated a call for more Western military aid to
neighboring states.
   South Africa says its purpose in raiding Botswana is to strike
bases of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla movement
seeking to end white domination of South Africa.
