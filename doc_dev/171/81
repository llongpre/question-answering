  [Text] In a major blow for openness this week, the MAIL 
&amp; 
GUARDIAN [WM&amp;G] forced the South African National Defence 
Force 
[SANDF] to confirm the names of members of the shadowy 
Directorate of Covert Collection [DCC]. 
  The WM&amp;G sent the military a list of 62 individuals 
with the 
request that they should reveal their present and past 
relationship with the DCC. Yesterday the SANDF confirmed that 
11 were still working for DCC and that 36 others had been 
employees. 
  In court papers justifying the interdict against the 
WM&amp;G, 
SANDF chief General Georg Meiring last week cited the need to 
protect the identity of intelligence operatives. 
  The following are DCC members: 

  -  Director Brigadier Horace William Doncaster, who once 
allegedly headed the Johannesburg City Council spy ring. 
  -  Second in command Colonel Gerrie Borman, the senior staff 
officer for the East Front, which includes Swaziland, Tanzania, 
Uganda, Lesotho and Zimbabwe. 
  -  Pat Keyser, SSO West Front -- Botswana, Namibia, Angola, 
Zaire 
and Zambia. Kayser was formerly with the Rhodesian Central 
Intelligence Organisation [CIO] which initiated Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance]. He moved to SADF [South 
African Defense Force] MI's [Military Intelligence] Directorate 
of Special Tasks, responsible for running Renamo in Mozambique 
and Unita [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
in Angola, and later to DCC. 
  -  Colonel Gert Pretorius, SSO Foreign Intelligence Services, 
whose job is to identify threats from foreign intelligence 
agencies. 
  -  John Maudsley, now believed to be running Internal 
Collection. 
  -  Sandra Nolan. 
  -  Leon Nefdt. 
  -  Terry Scallan, based in the Eastern Cape. 
  -  Lieb Venter. 


    Also understood to be in the DCC's employ is Henri van der 
Westhuizen, responsible for intelligence on the ANC until March 
this year. After the WM&amp;G sent its list of suspected DCC 
members to the military this week, Van der Westhuizen assaulted 
a former SADF [South African Defense Force] officer he believed 
to be one of our sources. 
  Past employees of the DCC: 

  -  Brigadier Tolletjie Botha, former DCC director who lost 
his job after the Goldstone raid. 
  -  Colonel At Nel, one of Botha's deputies, who also lost his 
job. 
  -  Jean Blignaut. 
  -  Ferdi Bernard, the former CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau] 
member 
hired by DCC between May and December 1991. 
  -  Warrant Officer Clive Brink, who once worked in Ciskei for 
Military Intelligence front organisation International 
Researchers/Ciskei Intelligence Services, whose task was to prop 
up the Gqozo regime. 
  -  Lucas Delport, now possibly working as a diplomat. 
  -  Jose D'Oliviera, an Angolan Portuguese who ran the DCC field 
office in Rundu, Namibia, and was allegedly an ivory smuggler. 
  -  Pamela du Randt, arrested by British police while allegedly 
on 
a mission to kill Dirk Coetzee. 
  -  Leon Flores, arrested along with Du Randt. 
  -  Tony Oosthuizen, who until March was responsible for 
intelligence on the PAC. 
  -  Mickey Geletti. 
  -  Deon Gerber. 
  -  Gerhard Jansen van Rensburg lost his job after the Goldstone 
raid. 
  -  Koos Louw, now a naval commander in Saldanha. 
  -  Alec West, ex-Rhodesian CIO, Colin Evans and Albie Botha, all 
rehired after the Goldstone raid. 
  -  Leon Nefdt. 
  -  Jan Anton Nieuwoudt, who trained Inkatha members at the 
Caprivi 
Strip in the 1980s and later ran the International 
Researchers-Ciskei Intelligence Services operation in Ciskei for 
DCC. He won a R220,000 [rand] payout from the SADF shortly 
before the elections. 
  -  Sandra Nolan, the administrative officer responsible for 
running key front companies. 
  -  JP Opperman, now based in the Durban field office. 
  -  Eugene Riley, who was recruited to DCC by Ferdi Barnard. He 
died under mysterious circumstances. 
  -  Jim Ross, who moved on to track down illegal diamond dealers 
for Anglo American Corporation. 
  -  An Askari [former ANC member working for the South African 
police] formerly employed by Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock, 
Chris Makgopa. Another Askari hired by DCC, Glory "September" 
Sedibe, died mysteriously. 
  -  Stephan Snyders, who was accused of criminal activities after 
the Goldstone raid and lost his job. 
  -  Philip Steenkamp. 
  -  Rick Verster, who was accused of criminal activities after 
the 
Goldstone raid and lost his job. 
  -  Wally Wilsenach, who lost his job after the Goldstone 
raid. 


    Army Intelligence members were also attached to DCC.
