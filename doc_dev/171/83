  [Text] Namibians who served with Koevoet [crowbar -- 
counterinsurgency group] and the South West African Territorial 
Force [SWAFT] can return to Namibia from South Africa. At a 
recent meeting of Cabinet it was resolved they can come home 
"through normal channels". 
  The same welcome is not extended to any who are not 
Namibians 
and they "will not be allowed to return" according to a Cabinet 
announcement yesterday. 
  Last month, Namibia's representative in Pretoria Joshua 
Hoebeb said he had been approached by representatives of 550 
former Koevoet members, who wanted to come home with 1,100 
dependents. They were apparently fearful about their future in 
the new South Africa and the issue was urgent as they were due 
to be evicted from their settlement at a disused mine in 
northern Transvaal at the end of last month. 
  The Cabinet decision could also open the door to some 5,000 
former Bushmen soldiers who were taken by the SA Defence Force 
to a camp at Schmidsdrift, northwest of Kimberly. These are 
reportedly unhappy and keen to return. 
  Former Koevoet members in other parts of South Africa may 
also want to come back. Callers to radio chat shows have asked 
where the returnees would settle and how they would support 
themselves if their only skills are fighting, including against 
civilians. The Cabinet decision makes it clear that only those 
who can prove they are Namibians will be able to return. 
  Yesterday's announcement reads: "All ex-Koevoet/SWAFT 
members who are stranded there are advised to contact the 
Namibian Embassy in Pretoria for registration before 
repatriation." 
  Many other nationalities including Angolans and Zambians 
fought alongside the Namibians and South Africans in the SA-led 
armies. Most of them will have been issued with SWA [South-West 
Africa] identity documents or SA passports, but some may be 
genuine Namibians and find it difficult to produce their birth 
certificates and other documentation necessary to prove this. 
  Cabinet says "it is absolutely vital that all those involved 
give correct information to the registration officials." 
  Most of those now in South Africa travelled there around the 
time of independence, or were taken by the former SA Defence 
Force. They did not trust promises they would not be victimised 
under Namibia's national reconciliation policy. 
  Only now do they see that overall former soldiers of both 
Swapo [South-West African People's Organisation] and its former 
enemies are in the Namibia Defence Force and some have been 
helped with resettlement and other projects. 
  Meanwhile they are concerned about their future as aliens 
under an African National Congress, especially as Koevoet was 
sometimes accused of 'third force' activities in South Africa's 
townships in recent years.
