  [Text] The U. S. Congressional delegation yesterday met the 
vice president and minister of finance and development planning, 
Mr. Festus Mogae, and the minister of foreign affairs, Dr. 
Gaositwe Chiepe. Present at Dr. Chiepe's office was the deputy 
speaker of the National Assembly, Mr. (Lemina Kgaganeng). 
  The delegation, which left Botswana this morning, came to 
familiarize themselves with the political and economic 
conditions in the country. 
  The vice president told the U. S. team that Botswana is very 
much involved with the economics and politics of the southern 
African region. He said the country appreciates the 
Congressmen's interest in Botswana. Mr. Mogae said it would 
also be appreciated if efforts in integrating the region's 
economies and finding peace in Mozambique, Angola, and South 
Africa are supported. He also briefed them about the Southern 
African Customs Union, SADC [Southern African Development 
Community], and the Community for Eastern and Southern Africa. 
  Earlier Dr. Chiepe told the U. S. team that the complex 
situation in South Africa needs a lot of patience, research, and 
discussions from all walks of life. She said she is happy that 
the whole world is now giving attention to South Africa. Dr. 
Chiepe said Botswana looks forward to South Africa joining SADC.
