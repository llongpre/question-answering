<F P=106> [Article by Serge Marti: "A Market of 115 Million </F>
Inhabitants"] 
  [Text] Installed to collect information needed in the 
struggle against the communist enemy back in the Cold War days, 
the computers at the Silvermine defense intelligence station 
situated near the Simon's Town naval base, about 20 km from the 
Cape of Good Hope, are now obsolete. But the "Cape route" for 
shipping and the 3,000 km of South African coastline are still 
of prime geostrategic importance and a major economic asset. 
Located at the confluence of major commercial routes, the 
country has port, road, and rail infrastructure that is both a 
gateway to the rest of the African continent and a natural 
outlet for southern African countries that have no direct access 
to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. 
  Despite--or perhaps because of--the relative international 
isolation forced upon it as a result of its policy of "separate 
development," South Africa also has become a true regional 
economic power. Sitting on a vast heap of gold (the country has 
50 percent of global reserves) and diamonds (25 percent), it 
furnishes 52 percent of the electricity, 83 percent of the 
steel, and 97 percent of coal products for the whole continent, 
and provides half its industrial production. 
  Now that the country is committed to the path of 
democratizing its institutions and opening up to the outside 
world, the wealth that was built on a foundation of racial 
inequality and discrimination is both seductive and worrisome to 
its neighbors, who are frightened at the hegemonic tendencies 
that might emerge in the "new South Africa." 
  The international community, deaf to misgivings frequently 
articulated by experts on the region--"Southern Africa stands to 
South Africa in the same relationship that Europe would stand to 
Germany, if Germany were all Europe had"--is trying once again 
to evoke that "Afro-optimism," which so often miscarried in the 
past as one African country after the next fell into insolvency. 
And it dares to hope that this "politico-socio-economic 
laboratory" with its eyes turned (at least for the moment) 
toward Europe, its principal trading partner--a laboratory 
situated midway between two high-growth zones, Asia Pacific and 
Latin America, whose future seems assured at least for a 
generation---will be the engine of economic development that 
sub-Saharan Africa so desperately needs. "Nigeria and South 
Africa are the only big economic powers capable of stabilizing 
the African continent," says one observer familiar with these 
countries. 
  It is an observed fact that South Africa's trade with its 
neighbors comprises only a very small part (less than 7 percent) 
of its total external commerce--the country's inward looking 
orientation was deplored by the African Development Bank in a 
recent report prepared at the request of Egypt's Husni Mubarak. 
All the more reason to expect, now that South Africa has turned 
over a new ideological leaf and the former so-called frontline 
states opposed to apartheid have done the same, that trade will 
expand among the southern African countries with their combined 
population of 115 million inhabitants--who represent 115 million 
potential consumers--however slowly the economic capacity of 
their respective countries might grow. 
<H5>  Regional Integration </H5>
  The next phase should be real regional integration, in 
stages, by means of economic cooperation instruments whose role 
now needs to be reexamined. This is the working hypothesis 
advanced by Alan Hirsch, assistant director and economics 
instructor at Cape University, one of the architects of South 
Africa's future commercial policy, which was drawn up for 
Mandela's ANC. 
  "Our neighbors have no reason to fear economic domination 
from our side. On the contrary, it is in our interest to help 
them expand their own economies," he says. This white official, 
head of Cape's development policy research unit, developed the 
theory at the meeting in Gaborone (Botswana) last February, in 
collaboration with the ANC's "external trade relations" team and 
representatives of the southern African countries. 
  This regional miniconference afforded an opportunity to see 
the extremely cautious approach taken by both sides. While the 
other countries in the region may favor increased cooperation 
with Pretoria, they realize very clearly that in many product 
areas, competition is likely to prevail over complementarity. 
"There is such a gulf between South Africa and its neighbors 
that there is a risk of killing embryonic industries in Namibia, 
Botswana, and Zimbabwe," one expert confirmed. 
  On the South African side, the "Mandela team," and hence the 
future government of national union, although describing itself 
as intensely interested in relations with its neighbors, does 
not intend to be diverted from the top priority of the hour, 
amelioration of the country's domestic situation. However,, the 
ANC has not ruled out consideration of other partners. "We do 
want access to other markets besides Europe and southern 
Africa," says Mr. Hirsch, adding that ANC already has made 
contacts with the United States to ask for most favored nation 
[MFN] status. The big lesson learned from the Gaborone meeting 
was that if integration is going to happen, the panoply of 
regional accords now in force will have to be revised. 
  These agreements come in several different forms, from 
simple 
free trade area to customs union, and even the beginnings of 
what might evolve into a regional common market--"our own 
version of the European Union," as President de Klerk puts it. 
Already the region has a Common Monetary Area (CMA); a monetary 
union comprising South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland; and a 
South African Customs Union (SACU) that includes South Africa, 
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia (since its independence in 1990), and 
Swaziland. 
  In addition to these monetary and customs institutions, 
there 
are economic cooperation agreements. The most important of these 
is the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) that encompasses 18 central 
and east African countries but until now has excluded South 
Africa. The Southern Africa Development and Coordination 
Conference (SADCC) composed of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, 
Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe 
has set its sights higher. Revamped in 1993 as the South African 
Development Community (SADC), it intends to put its political 
past behind it. 
<H5>  Immigration Issue </H5>
  In all likelihood, the future integration of the region, 
with 
Pretoria as catalyst, will be grafted onto PTA and SADC. But do 
not forget: It is not going to happen in the immediate future. 
"Hopes of seeing South Africa play a major role in the region 
are probably exaggerated," says the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in a study on the country's 
future that appeared in the house magazine, OBSERVER. "The 
private sector is clearly less committed to investing in the 
region than was hoped, if only in terms of the small volume of 
investments in South Africa itself," add the authors of the 
article, underscoring the country's need to resolve its own 
internal problems before anything else. 
  One of these is the increasing volume of immigration from 
neighboring countries, which certainly will add new 
complications to future commercial or economic negotiations 
among the southern African countries. Mandela warned some time 
ago that South Africa could not afford to become "the job market 
for the entire region." More bluntly, his entourage has openly 
admitted it will be necessary to "deport 2 million undesirables" 
hailing from such places as Zaire and Mozambique. The future 
government of national union may adopt legislation to this end. 
  Meanwhile, an ANC delegation visited France early this year 
for talks with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. No doubt 
Pasqua's lieutenants provided the ANC representatives with some 
"tried-and-true" prescriptions in this domain.
