<HEAD>South Africans Charged in Botswana For Border Incursion</HEAD>

   Two South Africans were charged in
court Wednesday in connection with a border incursion earlier this
week that left three policemen wounded, one critically, officials
said.
   Johannes Basson, 25, identified by Botswanan police as a South
African army corporal, and Theodore Hermansen, 30, said to be a
South African police or army reservist, were charged in a
magistrate's court with endangering Botswana's security, committing
grievous bodily harm and attempting to cause death.
   They were denied bail and will be held in police custody for two
weeks until their next court appearance.
   The South African military said an army unit crossed into
Botswana Monday night on an intelligence mission linked to efforts
to combat the outlawed African National Congress. It did not
elaborate.
   The ANC is a black guerrilla movement fighting to topple South
Africa's white minority government because of its policies of
racial separation, or apartheid.
   The South African military has neither confirmed nor denied that
the two arrested men are security force members. It has admitted
its unit fired shots at a Botswanan police patrol but said the unit
fired only after the police shot first.
   Botswana's police commissioner, Simon Hirschfeldt, insisted the
Botswanan police were unarmed. He said police in Botswana do not
carry arms on routine patrols and his men could not have fired
``with empty hands.''
   Three Botswanan policemen were injured in the shooting incident.
Hirschfeldt said one was in critical condition after being hit by
10 bullets.
   Botswana says five other South African commandos who fired the
shots escaped back into South Africa. The two arrested men
attempted a getaway in two Botswana police cars and were arrested
at a roadblock, police said.
   South African commandos have staged numerous border raids in the
past on suspected ANC facilities in Botswana and neighboring
countries. In none of the previous raids have any commandos been
captured.
   The U.S. Embassy issued a statement Wednesday condemning the
South African raid. ``By firing on and wounding unarmed policemen,
the South African government has once again shown its disregard for
international law,'' the statement said.
   At the United Nations Wednesday, Botswana's Ambassador Joseph
Legwaila said he will seek a meeting of the Security Council to
condemn the incident.
   The ambassador said Botswana has been plagued by raids from
South Africa because it supports the African National Congress.
``Botswana is and will always remain a friend of the ANC and an
enemy of South Africa,'' he said.
   Government-run Radio South Africa said Wednesday that 23 African
National Congress guerrillas who were recently captured in South
Africa between June 10 and 13 had received their instructions and
weapons in Botswana.
