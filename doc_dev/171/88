   Armed men raided a village near
Botswana's border with South Africa on Monday, killing two people
and burning several huts, a news agency reported.
   Police told the Botswana Press Association they suspected
``elements of the South African Defense Force'' were involved in the
attack on Ditlharapeng village on the Molopo River, which marks the
border between Botswana and South Africa.
   In South Africa, a military spokesman denied the allegation.
   Botswana police said an ``incendiary device'' was used in the
attack, adding that footprints of the attackers were traced back to
the river.
   The raid came four days after two white South Africans captured
in an aborted raid in Botswana were sentenced to 10 years in prison
and eight lashes with a cane. Johannes Basson, 25, and Theodore
Hermansen, 30, were apprehended following a June 20 clash in which
three unarmed Botswana police officers were injured.
   South Africa has staged periodic raids into neighboring countries
in recent years in search of members of the African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting the South African
government. More than a dozen alleged South African agents have been
charged in Botswana and Zimbabwe this year for security-related
offenses.
   Botswana says it is sympathetic to the aims of the guerrilla
group, but that it does not want its territory to be used as a
lauching site for raids into South Africa.
