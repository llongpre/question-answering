   Here is a thumbnail sketch of Angola, where South
Africa has proposed that a cease-fire in the 13-year-old civil war
begin on Aug. 10:
   TERRITORY: With 481,354 square miles in southeastern Africa,
Angola is the second-largest African country south of the Sahara.
But it has only 8 million people, most of them living in tribal
villages and rural areas.
   HISTORY: Portuguese settlers reached Angola in the 15th century
and ruled it as a colony until Angolan independence in 1975.
Virtually all the Portuguese fled at that time, leaving the country
more than 90 percent illiterate and woefully short of capital and
skilled workers.
   GOVERNMENT: The Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola, one of the guerrilla groups who fought the Portuguse, has
controlled the country since it seized Luanda, the capital, in
early 1976 with the help of Cuban troops. An estimated 50,000 Cuban
troops are aiding the Angolan government. President Eduardo dos
Santos has consistently refused negotiations with the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as UNITA, which
seeks a power-sharing agreement.
   REBELS: Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels fought the Portuguese until
they departed and now oppose the government. UNITA receives U.S.
and South African military aid. South Africa has an estimated 3,000
troops in Angola. UNITA says it controls about one-third of Angola
and claims widespread popular support.
   ECONOMY: Almost 200 oil wells in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda
supply more than 90 percent of the country's export earnings. U.S.
oil companies help run the petroleum fields. Cuban and Angolan
troops protect them from UNITA guerrillas, who use American weapons
in a bid to sabotage the facilities. Angola is also rich in
diamonds and has potential for mining other minerals including
uranium.
   REFUGEES: About 1.5 million Angolans have fled areas of fighting
and are registered as displaced persons in the country, according
to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Neighboring Zambia has
given shelter to 97,000 Namibian refugees. A small number of
Angolan refugees are in Botswana.
