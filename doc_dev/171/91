   South African soldiers raided a house
on the outskirts of this border capital early Monday, killing a man
and three women during an hour-long gun battle.
   The South African Defense Force claimed responsibility in a
statement issued in Pretoria 10 hours after the attack ended about
2 a.m.
   It described the victims as ``terrorists'' of the African
National Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting white
domination in South Africa.
   Both the United States and Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N.
secretary-general, condemned the raid. State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said: ``It appears the South African authorities
made no attempt to seek the cooperation of the Botswana authorities
in dealing with the alleged security threat.''
   In Gaborone, President Quett Masire's office said the man was
South African, two women were Botswanans and the third woman had
not been identified.
   According to the statement, all were sleeping when the South
Africans attacked at 1 a.m. in an area of the Phiring suburb called
Tsholofelo.
   ``The office of the president strongly condemns this dastardly
attack and murder of innocent people in Botswana by the South
African army,'' it said. ``South Africa's problems cannot be
resolved by attacking neighboring countries such as Botswana.''
   Botswana ``strongly urges the South African government to engage
in meaningful negotiations with the genuine leadership of the
oppressed majority in that country,'' the statement said.
   South Africa's 5 million whites control the government and
economy, and the 26 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs.
   The statement from the South African military called the raid a
follow-up to a shootout near the border with Botswana on Friday,
which had not been reported previously. In that attack soldiers
killed ``three suspected terrorists'' in a running battle near a
farm, capturing rifles, machine pistols and hand grenades, the
statement said.
   ``Following up on intelligence gathered during Friday's
operation, an element of the Defense Force killed four more
terrorists ... on the northern outskirts of Gaborone early today,''
it said.
   Monday's raid provides ``further evidence that ANC terrorists,
originating from Zambia and Zimbabwe, use Botswana as a transit
route to infiltrate into South Africa,'' it said.
   Defense Minister Magnas Malan said the ``pre-emptive'' raid
``resulted in the prevention of killings and maimings of innocent
people at a later stage.''
   A dispatch from the Botswana Press Association quoted Norman
Moleboge, the deputy police commissioner, as saying the four
victims were shot and set afire, and gasoline containers were found
at the scene. It said an explosion may have been caused by a gas
cylinder in the house.
   Neighbors said they heard sporadic fire from automatic weapons,
and possibly grenade explosions. They reported seeing people flee
in a vehicle and others run into the bush. Two said the raiders
left in a helicopter.
   One witness said a woman ran from the house and sought shelter
in his home.
   South Africa has issued several threats to Botswana in the past
few months, accusing it of harboring African National Congress
guerrillas.
   Masire's government supports ANC goals and allows its
representatives in the country, but says it does not permit
guerrillas to attack South Africa from Botswana's territory.
   The South African military has raided alleged guerrilla hideouts
in Botswana several times in recent years. One person was killed in
an attack in May 1986 and a raid in June 1985 left 15 dead.
