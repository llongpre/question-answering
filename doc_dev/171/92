   A third South African has been
arrested in connection with an army incursion into Botswana,
authorities said Monday.
   Barry Viviers appeared in magistrate's court on a charge of
unlawful possession of a hand grenade found at his home Friday.
   Police said Viviers, who lives in Gaborone, had been in contact
with a suspected South African commando, Theodore Hermansen, on the
day before the June 20 cross-border mission.
   During the incursion, a five-member South African army unit
fired at a group of Botswana policemen, injuring three officers.
Those five soldiers escaped back to South Africa, but Hermansen and
a colleague, Johannes Basson, were arrested at a roadblock and have
been charged with violating Botswana's National Security Act.
   Viviers, 20, was ordered held pending a bail application later
this week. He was born in Botswana but lived for most of his life
in South Africa before returning to Gaborone a few years ago.
   South African officials have said the army unit entered Botswana
on an intelligence mission as part of the campaign to combat the
African National Congress guerrilla movement. It has neither
confirmed nor denied Botswana's allegation that Hermansen and
Basson were linked to the mission.
   Botswana said the commandos planned a raid on a target in
Gaborone and has accused South Africa of ``state terrorism.''
   South Africa claims its soldiers fired at the policemen after
being fired at first. Botswama says the police patrol was unarmed.
