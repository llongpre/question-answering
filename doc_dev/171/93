   Pope John Paul began a tour of one of
Africa's most prosperous and democratic countries today as the
Vatican announced a fifth papal visit to the continent next year.
South Africa was not included.
   ``Botswana is an island of peace with itself and its
neighbors,'' the pope told an airport crowd of several thousand,
among them a choir of barebreasted schoolgirls. ``In fact, it can
be rightly called an island of peace in a troubled sea.'
   The diamond-rich nation maintains a Western-style, multiparty
democracy in a region of one-party black-ruled states. Besides
conflict over racial segregation in South Africa, southern Africa
is torn by guerrilla warfare and civil strife.
   Botswana has largely avoided involvement in these conflicts but
South Africa has made several raids against what it claims are
guerrilla centers of the African National Congress, which is
fighting to overthrow South Africa's government. Botswana has
denied that it harbors guerrillas.
   Before the pope flew from Zimbabwe for the second stop on his
five-nation African tour, Vatican spokesman Joaquim Navarro said
John Paul had accepted invitations to visit Madagascar and Tanzania.
   There has been speculation that John Paul also would visit
Angola and possibly South Africa on that trip, expected next May.
Navarro said neither country was ``on the program,'' although he
confirmed that Angolan bishops had recently addressed an invitation
to the pope.
   On his current visit, the pope has coupled condemnation of South
Africa's apartheid policies with pleas for dialogue with South
Africa to solve regional problems.
   According to Navarro, the Vatican plays an active role in
regional peacemaking efforts, and sent French Cardinal Roger
Etchegarray, a top aide, to the region three times in the past
year. Etchegarray met with officials of South Africa, Angola and
Mozambique in May and presented them with a letter from John Paul.
   The pope concludes his tour with a visit to Mozambique on
Saturday. Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas, in a statement
issued in Lisbon, Portugal, said they would declare a unilateral
cease-fire around the Mozambican cities the pope will visit _
Maputo, Beira and Nampula.
   But Navarro stopped short of claiming a mediation role for the
Vatican.
   ``The role of the Holy See in affairs of the region is not and
doesn't want to be a mediation role in the diplomatic sense of the
word,'' Navarro told reporters. ``It wants to create a climate in
which dialogue can be possible.''
   John Paul was scheduled to meet Botswana President Quett Masire
and give a Mass at the national stadium in Gaborone during a visit
of less than 24 hours. The expected crowd of 50,000 at the stadium
would be larger than the number of Roman Catholic church members in
the country, about 45,000.
   The pontiff was scheduled to leave Wednesday morning for the
mountain kingdom of Lesotho, where thousands of pilgrims from South
Africa were expected to attend ceremonies.
   During a three-day visit to Zimbabwe, the pope appealed for
reconciliation and human rights, and for an end to racial and
tribal discrimination. He celebrated two masses, held a rally of
more than 30,000 young people, talked with diplomats and met
Catholic bishops and other Christian leaders from the region.
