   Shifting winds bring either
desert sandstorms or a cold Atlantic fog into this isolated harbor
town. It is, nonetheless, the prize in a bitter dispute.
   South Africa says it has sovereignty over the town and a patch of
surrounding desert, even though it is halfway up the Namibian coast,
more than 600 miles from the nearest part of South Africa.
   Ownership might have gone uncontested, except that Walvis Bay has
the only deepwater port serving Namibia, which is due to attain
independence after 74 years of South African rule.
   Namibian politicians want Walvis Bay. South African leaders say
Namibians, if cooperative, can use the port but will never own it.
   ``It belongs to South Africa,'' said Martinhus Botma, who
represents Walvis Bay in South Africa's Parliament. ``Just to start
dishing out property isn't wise.''
   The enclave's strategic value is high. It contains South African
army, navy and air force bases, and has the best-equipped port
between Cape Town in South Africa and Luanda in Angola.
   It is the center of Namibia's fishing industry. Major exports
such as copper and uranium go through the port, as well as essential
imports.
   The South-West African People's Organization, the
guerrilla-backed movement which hopes to govern Namibia, says South
Africa might use Walvis Bay as a springboard for raids.
   SWAPO intends to go to the World Court at the Hague in the
Netherlands to seek control over Walvis Bay. If this fails, SWAPO
leaders threaten to cut off the enclave's water and electricity.
   But municipal officials in Walvis Bay say these threats are
empty, because water is obtained from underground and electricity
can be supplied by expanding a backup power plant.
   Another option would be to build a new port or expand a small
fishing harbor at Luderitz, about 250 miles to the south. Enormous
costs would be involved.
   The enclave covers 480 square miles and has about 26,000
inhabitants _ 9,000 whites, 13,000 blacks, 4,000 people of
mixed-race.
   One long-time resident of Kuisebmond, the enclave's black
township, is SWAPO's acting president, Nathaniel Mahuilili.
   ``We will do everything possible to get Walvis Bay back, except
to beg,'' he said. ``We can't go crawling to them, saying, `Please,
boss, let us use our own harbor.'''
   If South Africa resists, Mahuilili said, blacks will leave Walvis
Bay and ``make it a spook town.''
