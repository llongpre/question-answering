   The United Nations began one of its most
ambitious repatriation operations Monday, bringing hundreds of
Namibian exiles home to participate in the territory's independence
process.
   The first plane arriving at the Windhoek airport from Lusaka,
Zambia, brought about 150 refugees, including adults who have lived
abroad for more than a decade and children who set foot on Namibian
soil for the first time.
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees sought to repatriate more
than 1,300 refugees on 11 flights Monday, but several flights were
canceled after delays and only about 700 refugees returned,
officials said.
   ``They are all in very good health and they are all very happy,''
said Nicolas Bwakira, the U.N. official in charge of the airlift,
who greeted the first batch of returnees.
   The United Nations has registered 41,000 Namibian refugees at
camps in neighboring Angola, Zambia and Botswana. The world body
wants to bring back more than 1,000 refugees a day for the next six
weeks under the independence plan for Africa's last colony, which
has been ruled by South Africa for 74 years.
   In addition to the airlift, hundreds of refugees have crossed the
border from Angola on foot, Namibian officials said.
   The returning refugees were greeted at the airport by about 250
demonstrators wearing the red, blue and green colors of the
South-West Africa People's Organization guerrilla movement.
   SWAPO fought a 23-year bush war with the South African security
forces and now is the most powerful political faction in Namibia.
   The demonstrators included women who sang and men who chanted
pro-SWAPO slogans. They held up signs that pictured SWAPO leader Sam
Nujoma and read, ``Welcome Home SWAPO Freedom Fighters.''
   U.N. troops from Kenya kept the crowd behind ropes as the
refugees went through customs and boarded buses for the 30-mile trip
to the Doebra Refugee Camp outside Windhoek.
   A tent city was built as temporary shelter for the refugees on
the grounds of a Roman Catholic mission. Buses carrying the first
group of refugees were met by about 400 students from the mission
school.
   The students sang and danced outside the compound where the
refugees lined up to receive ration cards and blankets from U.N.
workers.
   U.N. officials have said they expect the refugees to leave the
camp and join relatives within a week.
   Another demonstration took place at a busy highway intersection
at the camp entrance. About 15 members of the Parents Committee of
Namibia held up signs demanding SWAPO account for more than 100
people who joined the organization but have not been heard from.
   ``SWAPO, Where Is My Son?'' said a sign held by a man who added
that his 18-year-old son left to join the organization eight years
ago and has not been heard from since.
   The Parents Committee and other organizations have charged that
SWAPO dissidents were kept prisoner and beaten or executed if they
tried to leave the movement.
   SWAPO has said it released 200 dissidents and denies that it
killed any disenchanted members. SWAPO has said many of the
dissidents were South African spies.
   Under the U.N. independence plan, Namibian elections are set for
November. The polls are to establish a constituent assembly, which
would then set up a black majority government. About 94 percent of
the territory's 1.3 million people are black.
   SWAPO is expected to win the most votes, but it is unclear if
they will be able to capture the two-thirds majority needed to
control the government.
   Under a regional peace treaty signed in December, South Africa
agreed to relinquish control of Namibia in return for Cuba
withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola. The Cubans
fought alongside government forces in their battle against
U.S.-backed rebels.
