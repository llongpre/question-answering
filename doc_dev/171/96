   Zimbabwe celebrated a decade of
independence Wednesday with military marches and tribal dancing,
while President Robert Mugabe said he welcomed an end to the
British-brokered constitution.
   A near-capacity crowd joined Mugabe, seven other African
presidents and scores of foreign dignitaries at a 60,000-seat
stadium outside Harare for festivities. Processions and rallies
were organized countrywide.
   ``We are here to share our jubilation on this historic and
momentous occasion,'' said Mugabe, a former schoolteacher who led
his country to indepedendence from British colonial rule April 18,
1980. The former white-ruled colony of Rhodesia was mired in a
guerrilla war for seven years before independence.
   Mugabe said the second decade of independence would witness even
greater moves toward unity, peace and progress.
   ``We can do it. Yes, we can do it together as one united people,
one nation,'' he said.
   Mugabe carefully avoided referring to controversial issues such
as his avowed aim to turn one of Africa's few Western-style
democracies into a Marxist one-party state.
   Mugabe said he welcomed Wednesday's expiration of the 10-year
constitution brokered by the British that contained ``entrenched
racial provisions'' protecting the interests of the 90,000-strong
white community.
   ``We shall proceed, in the name of justice, equity and fairness,
to amend these provisions so as to make more land available to the
peasant population,'' he said.
   Under the so-called Lancaster House constitution, 20 seats in
the 100-member Parliament were reserved for whites for the first
seven years of independence. Legal clauses blocked the seizure of
white-owned property.
   The formula was intended to stop a mass exodus of skilled whites.
   The government says 4,000 mostly white commercial farmers still
own more than one-fourth of all land, while some 8 million peasants
occupy about one-third of property. The rest is state property and
wilderness preserves.
   But state officials have said that after April 18, they will
move to buy little-used farmland. Widescale seizures of farms are
not expected.
   During his anniversary address, Mugabe acknowledged the role of
large commercial farms in the economy. He said that apart from
wheat imports, this Southern African nation of 9.2 million people
is self-sufficient in food.
   He also praised local industries, mainly in the hands of white
entrepreneurs. Manufacturers generate nearly 30 percent of the
gross domestic product of about $4 billion, Mugabe said.
   He said more local and foreign investment in production was
needed to combat rising uemployment and shortages of essential
commodities.
   Flanked by President Danial arap Moi of Kenya and President
Hastings Kamuzu Banda of Malawi, Mugabe said his people were eager
for regional peace and an end to South Africa's system of racial
separation.
   Mugabe and Moi are mediating efforts to end the 12-year-old
civil war in neighboring Mozambique.
   Hundreds of Zimbabweans have died in cross-border raids by
rebels from Mozambique scavenging food and supplies. More than
12,000 Zimbabwean troops are fighting alongside government forces
there.
   Other African presidents at the celebrations were Quett Masire
of Botswana, Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia, Sam Nujoma of
Namibia and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia.
   Foreign dignitaries representing 30 countries included South
African black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela, South African
church leader Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Coretta Scott King, widow
of slain U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King.
