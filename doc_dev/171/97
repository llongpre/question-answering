   Maurice Tempelsman, a wealthy New York diamond
merchant often seen at social events on the arm of Jacqueline
Kennedy-Onassis, is a major player behind the scenes of
African-American relations.
   Little known to the public at large _ his name doesn't even
appear in Who's Who _ Tempelsman has contacts across the continent
from when he started doing business more than three decades ago.
   The 60-year-old businessman is on a first-name basis with
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South Africa's anti-apartheid activist; is
called ``grand-pere'' by Gabon's President El Hadj Omar Bongo; and
entertains Zaire President Sese Seko Mobutu.
   Until recently, the balding, portly teddy bear of a man,
preferred to remain behind the scenes.
   In 1989, Tempelsman became the board chairman of the prestigious
African-American Institute, the country's oldest nonprofit
organization dedicated to improving relations between the
continents.
   In that capacity, he's delivered lectures and continued to
travel to Africa as often as every two months.
   As an astute businessman, Tempelsman has cultivated Africans on
all sides of the political spectrum. He recently set up an office
in mineral-rich Namibia in advance of November's elections, a
precursor to independence in the South Africa-run territory.
   Over the years, he's been criticized from the left because of
his ties to DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which mines diamonds
from South Africa, among other places, and for once hiring the
CIA's top Africa official when the man retired from the agency.
   The right recently questioned Tempelsman's dealings with
Soviet-backed Angola. Tempelsman said he has a ``commercial
relationship'' with that country's National Diamond Co. The Angolan
government is embroiled in civil war with U.S.-backed rebels led by
Jonas Savimbi.
   Howard Phillips of the Conservative Caucus, a lobbying group,
also has suggested that Tempelsman may have had something to do
with Angola's contract to sell oil to Citizens Corp., a
Boston-based energy company started by Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass.,
Mrs. Onassis' nephew.
   Tempelsman pooh-poohs these attacks as coming from a ``group of
zealots who look at things from a conspiratorial point of view.''
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Africa
subcommittee, said Tempelsman frequently has attended the panel's
hearings.
   Tempelsman, who generally favors economic sanctions against
white-ruled South Africa, recently fought efforts to include uncut
diamonds in the sanctions bill, Wolpe said.
   With the help of his lawyer, Theodore Sorenson, former
speechwriter for the late President Kennedy, Tempelsman helped
persuade Wolpe and others that diamond sanctions would hurt
countries like Botswana more than South Africa because uncut
diamonds are not identified by their country of origin.
   A staunch Democrat, Tempelsman gives freely to the party as well
as to its political candidates.
   Nevertheless, he praised Reagan administration officials for
brokering a plan that led to elections in Namibia and an agreement
to withdraw Cuban troops from Angola.
   Tempelsman is the chief executive officer of Lazare Kaplan
International, a diamond-cutting concern, as well as a general
partner in Leon Tempelsman and Son Inc., an investment company with
interest in minerals, agriculture and industry.
   In a wide-ranging interview at his penthouse office overlooking
New York's Fifth Avenue, the Belgium-born Tempelsman reflected on
how his business interests merged with his appreciation for Africa,
and how he sees the future of the world's least-developed continent.
   His office, guarded by a tight security system, is tastefully
furnished with African art. All around are books and magazines
dealing with art, from Africa and the Greek and Roman periods.
   ``One is fortunate when career interests and philosophical
interests coincide,'' he said. ``It's always nicer to work at
something you like doing.''
   The Tempelsman family came to the United States around World War
II. But Tempelsman didn't get involved in Africa until business
took him to Ghana, the former Gold Coast, in the mid-1950s.
   Decolonization, which has taken place over the last three
decades, has been one of the ``more historical events in mankind's
history,'' Tempelsman said. ``I think Namibia is the last chapter.''
   While Tempelsman has prospered in part because of Africa's
minerals, some countries have seen their standards of living
decline and their people embroiled in endless civil wars.
   Describing nation-building as a ``risky adventure,'' Tempelsman
said, ``That continent is going through an agonizing period, mostly
economic, some self-inflicted, some subject to other factors.''
   To alleviate some countries' problems, Tempelsman favors action
from Washington to wipe out some of their debt as well as more aid.
   Generally, though, Tempelsman said foreigners can't dictate to
Africans how they should run their countries.
   ``It has to come from their own internal processes,'' he said.
``We can hector and condemn, but in the end both the benefits and
the fruit of political independence mean you have the right to make
your own mistakes.''
