Imagine a fleet of dirigibles - steerable airships - in the upper atmosphere
collecting and redirecting telephone calls around the world.
Implausible as it may sound, it was one option considered by Motorola, the
world's largest portable phone maker, in its search for ways to develop a
mobile phone service to extend from the wilds of Antarctica to the Kalahari
desert.
Motorola opted, instead, for satellites, and Iridium - the consortium it
leads - is now the front-runner in an expensive and technically complex race
that has been joined by seven consortia. What they envisage is a
high-quality service over low-cost pocket telephones offering calls at a
cost of Dollars 3 or less a minute and serving both cellular phone users and
those without access to cellular systems.
Cellular mobile phone services are well established in the developed world,
with 100m-200m cellular phones expected to be in use by 2000. But cellular
systems can only cover localised areas. Calls beyond their network must be
routed via earth-stations through geostationary satellites that hover some
22,000m above the Earth's surface, where, from the ground, they appear
stationary.
There are large areas of the world without access to the telephone
exchanges, lines, switching capacity and administrative capability to run
cellular phone services. Mobile phone users can still gain access to
geostationary satellites in these areas, using their own portable equipment
 -and the battlefield reports during the Gulf war bear witness to the
quality of such services. But the calls are expensive, at between Dollars 5
and Dollars 10 a minute, and the equipment needed to make and receive them
weighs more than a lap-top computer, fills a suitcase and costs Dollars
25,000.
The key to the new satellite services is advances in microelectronics which
have made it possible to cram an entire earth station, capable of
transmitting and receiving signals from up to 6,000 miles above the Earth's
surface, into a package no larger than a conventional pocket phone.
Iridium and its competitors, will launch low-earth orbit satellites (Leo)
that will circle the globe at a height of about 2,000km, and medium-earth
orbit satellites (Meo) at about 10,000km to handle the traffic.
Iridium has already built six of its planned 73 satellites and expects to
launch the first in 1997. Last week, Odyssey, a joint venture between TRW,
the US aerospace manufacturer, and Teleglobe, a Canadian telecommunications
operator, announced that they were joining the race. In addition,
Globalstar, developed by Loral and Qualcomm, Ellipsat, Constellation
Communications and American Mobile Satellite Corporation, are contenders
from North America.
These US contenders were last week submitting applications for the necessary
licences to the US Federal Communications Commission.
Between them, they will have to raise close to Dollars 10bn in debt and
equity. Only Iridium is so far fully subscribed; having raised Dollars 1.6bn
in equity, it is now looking for a further Dollars 1.8bn in loans. Odyssey,
the newcomer, which has a guaranteed Dollars 150m from TRW and Teleglobe, is
seeking a further Dollars 850m in equity and Dollars 1bn in loans.
Outside the US, only Inmarsat, a London-based, international consortium, has
announced plans to set up a global mobile phone network, called Project P. A
pioneer of satellite communications, Inmarsat first offered maritime voice
and data services, using a geostationary satellite system, in 1982. It now
provides satellite communications to some 40,000 customers in shipping and
aerospace.
Inmarsat's owners - leading telecommunications organisations in some 75
countries - have until December 16 to decide whether to put up the Dollars
1bn the organisation needs for the first phase of the Dollars 2.8bn Project
P.
Inmarsat, like the other consortia, plans to act as wholesaler, selling to
'customers' who will distribute the capacity worldwide. These distributors
are likely to be existing telecommunications companies such as Vodafone, the
UK cellular phone group, which will become Globalstar's franchisee for
countries where it operates cellular networks.
The service will still be more expensive than conventional mobile telephony
but the target customer is the global business traveller prepared to pay a
premium for a service that will be available anywhere. Other customers are
expected to include governments, small vessels, public and private emergency
services and users in areas suffering from poor communications.
Each consortia has its own, jealously guarded set of estimates on the likely
rewards from this market. Most calculations, however, are tied to the likely
population of mobile phones. Mr John Windolth, a spokesman for Iridium, says
that if the consortia had 1m subscribers for its voice service by 2002, 'We
would be very profitable'.
Mr Patrick McDougal, a spokesman for Inmarsat, believes its service could
break even within three years of its launch in 1999.
The technology used may prove significant in determining the price of the
service, with Iridium and Globalstar planning to use Leos and Odyssey and
Inmarsat planning to use Meos. Leo operators need more satellites to cover
the ground, but provide higher transmission quality. Meo operators promise
lowest cost and technological risk.
But adequate finance and management commitment are likely to prove far more
conclusive than earth orbits in sorting the winners from the losers. And the
only real certainty at present is that the rivalry between the consortia
will be intense. Analysts believe it is unlikely the market will be able to
support more than two competitive services by 2000.
