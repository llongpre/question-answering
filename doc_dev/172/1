   Today is Thursday, Aug. 24, the 236th day of 1989. There are 129
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Fifty years ago, on Aug. 24, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union
signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, each country pledging not to
``associate itself with any other grouping of powers which directly
or indirectly is aimed at the other party.''
   On this date:
   In A.D. 79, long-dormant Mount Vesuvius erupted, burying the
Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in volcanic ash. An
estimated 20,000 people died.
   In A.D. 410, Rome was overrun by the Visigoths, an event that
symbolized the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
   In 1572, the slaughter of French Protestants at the hands of
Catholics began in Paris on St. Bartholomew's Day. The killings
lasted until October, and claimed some 13,000 victims.
   In 1814, British forces invaded Washington, D.C., and proceeded
to set fire to the Capitol and the White House.
   In 1932, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to make a
non-stop flight across the United States, traveling from Los
Angeles to Newark, N.J., in just over 19 hours.
   In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty went into effect, with the
parties agreeing that an armed attack against one would be
considered ``an attack against them all.''
   In 1954, the Communist Control Act went into effect, virtually
outlawing the Communist Party in the United States.
   In 1959, three days after Hawaiian statehood, Hiram L. Fong was
sworn in as the first Chinese-American U.S. senator while Daniel K.
Inouye was sworn in as the first Japanese-American in the U.S.
House of Representatives.
   In 1968, France became the world's fifth thermonuclear power as
it exploded a hydrogen bomb in the South Pacific.
   In 1970, a bomb planted by anti-war extremists exploded at the
University of Wisconsin's Army Math Research Center in Madison,
killing 33-year-old researcher Robert Fassnacht.
   In 1981, Mark David Chapman was sentenced in New York to 20
years to life in prison for the shooting death of rock star John
Lennon.
   In 1982, Archbishop Joseph L. Bernardin was installed as head of
Chicago's Roman Catholic archdiocese.
   Ten years ago: A 73-hour stand-off began at New York's Kennedy
International Airport as U.S. officials prevented the takeoff of an
Aeroflot jetliner until they could determine whether Soviet
ballerina Lyudmila Vlasova was returning home voluntarily after the
defection to the United States of her husband, dancer Alexander
Godunov. (Vlasova was ultimately allowed to leave.)
   Five years ago: On the heels of the Republican convention,
Democrat Walter F. Mondale said the proceedings had demonstrated
that President Ronald Reagan represented the party of the rich,
while Reagan questioned Mondale's commitment to a strong defense.
   One year ago: Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
picked up the endorsement of the AFL-CIO while Republican nominee
George Bush campaigned in California with President Reagan.
   Today's birthdays: TV personality Durward Kirby is 77. TV host
Dennis James is 72. Former secretary of education Shirley
Hufstedler is 64. Boxer Gerry Cooney is 33. Actor Steve Guttenberg
is 31. All-star shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. is 29.
   Thought for today: ``Posterity is as likely to be wrong as
anybody else.'' _Heywood Broun, American journalist and author
(1888-1939).
