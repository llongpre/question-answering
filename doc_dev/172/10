   For President Reagan, his trip to New York for
the United Nations General Assembly meant a dramatic farewell
appearance. For fellow guests at his hotel, it meant something of a
nuisance.
   For reporters and photographers, it meant scrambling up and down
stairwells, waiting in line in a hotel kitchen and getting stuck in
an elevator.
   Reagan spoke at the U.N. on Monday, making his seventh
appearance there and his last before he leaves office in January.
   After his speech, he went to the United States Mission to the
United Nations for lunch. It's just across the street, so most
people would walk. Presidential security, however, required that he
make the crossing by motorcade.

   Then it was off to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, a few blocks away.
   The Waldorf had warned its guests of what was coming.
   ``It is my great pleasure to tell you that President Ronald
Reagan will be staying in the Waldorf Towers during your stay in
the hotel,'' manager Richard J. Cotter said in a letter handed out
at the registration desk.
   ``Unfortunately, however, it may mean some inconvenience for
you,'' Cotter added. ``To ensure the president's safety, the Park
Avenue entrance will be closed from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. on Monday
evening. Please be so kind as to enter and exit the hotel from the
Lexington Avenue area.''
   One woman entering the hotel from Lexington Avenue still found
herself inconvenienced when she was asked by a White House aide to
step aside while the traveling pool of journalists made their way
through the door.
   ``But we're staying here,'' she protested.

   Once inside, the pool was taken by elevator to a holding room on
the 33rd floor to wait until it was time to walk up three floors to
where the president was holding the first in a series of meetings
with foreign leaders.
   After a brief picture-taking and question-asking opportunity,
the scribes scrambled back down to the holding room to file stories
by telephone and wait for the next meeting.
   In a few minutes, however, a harried assistant manager of the
hotel showed up to announce that the room set aside as the holding
room turned out to be part of a suite rented to a permanent hotel
guest. So it was out in the hall for the reporters and their
telephones.

   The next event after the series of meetings was an evening
reception in a room decked with magnificent crystal chandeliers. To
get to it, reporters were ushered through the kitchen, past tray
after tray of dirty dishes, before standing in line to have
security officers check their equipment.
   Next morning, reporters were assembled in their third-floor
press room and taken to three elevators for the ride back up to the
33rd floor to wait for more meetings. At the ninth floor, one of
the elevators got stuck for 10 minutes.
   Word of the mishap apparently even got to the president.
   When the media people arrived on the 36th floor for Reagan's
meeting with Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan of Pakistan, the
president told them, ``You seem like you've been breathing hard.
I'm trying to pick out the ones who had to walk up the stairs.''
