Getting a jump on the Bush Administration, Congress announced Thursday that a 
first-ever conference of legislators from 33 nations will be convened in 
Washington next spring to consider global warming and other environmental 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
While it will precede by six months an international meeting on global warming 
to be hosted by President Bush, Senate sponsors of the April 29-May 2 meeting 
said it is intended to spur international cooperation, not to upstage the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the time for action is now," said Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), 
chairman of the Senate delegation to the conference. "We are ready to move." 
</P>
<P>
Gore insisted that the conference was not an exercise in one-upmanship. "This 
is in no way partisan," he said. "We are not taking an adversarial position 
against the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the seven-member Senate delegation said the meeting would give the 
United States a chance again to assume leadership on worldwide environmental 
issues that had been lost during the Reagan Administration. A House delegation 
will be named later. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said the conference of lawmakers -- authorized by 
legislation approved last August -- reflected a bipartisan concern that Bush 
was not responding fast enough to serious global problems despite his call for 
a major overhaul of the nation's clean-air laws. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 legislators -- including some from the Soviet Union, Poland and 
Hungary, but none from China -- were invited to the spring conference. The 
participants will seek consensus on a new set of environmental goals to deal 
with global warming and other major concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Gore said climate change, deforestation, the spread of deserts, depletion of 
the ozone layer, vanishing species, the impact of population growth and 
prospects for sustainable development would be the leading issues before the 
conference of lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"The global ecological crisis we face demands unprecedented responses such as 
this -- the first-ever gathering of the legislators ultimately responsible for 
... policies needed to change our future and the course of our world for 
generations to come," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) said the United States should take the lead on 
global environmental problems. By the time the conference is held, Chafee 
predicted, the Senate will have approved a clean-air bill that would eliminate 
production of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000 and reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions from cars. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) said the conference would enable the United States to 
regain its pre-eminent position on environmental issues. Sen. John Heinz 
(R-Pa.) contended that the federal government was lagging behind the states and 
individual citizens on these issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmental isolationism must be a way of the past," Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said in a statement. "Our planet has become too 
small to insist on acting alone or to insist on acting only if everyone adopts 
the same policy." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush had initially resisted calls for an international conference on 
global warming. During his Malta talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, however, Bush reversed himself and announced that the United States 
would host such a meeting next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration was criticized at a meeting in the Netherlands last month 
when it opposed efforts by virtually all other industrialized nations to limit 
gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
In February, two months before the congressional conference, an International 
Panel on Climate Change composed of scientists and other experts will meet in 
Washington to consider new evidence on global warming and devise ways to deal 
with it.
