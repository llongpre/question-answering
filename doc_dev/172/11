   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
opponents scorned what they called a cynical offer to negotiate his
resignation and kept Panama shut down Tuesday with a general strike
intended to force him out.
   An estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut by
the strike, which appeared to be gaining support on its second day.
Most shops and stores were closed, public transportation was halted
and many government employees did not go to work.
   Panama is out of cash because of pressure from the United States
to force the ouster of Noriega, who is the real power in Panama as
commander of its 15,000 soldiers and police. The U.S. dollar is the
national currency and the supply has been cut off.
   Most government workers were paid only $75 of their midmonth
wages last week and the $33 million end-of-the-month payroll for
the 130,000 public employees problably won't be met. Pension checks
due Wednesday have been delayed, at least until March 28.
   Hunger is spreading among workers as well as the poor,
unemployed and elderly. Many washerwomen, cleaning women, maids and
cooks have lost their jobs because there is no money with which to
pay them.
   Manuel Solis Palma, the civilian Noriega chose to run the
government, said on television Monday night the general would
resign in exchange for ``a national dialogue'' to reconcile
differences with opponents of the regime. He prefaced the offer
with a diatribe against the United States.
   The implication was that Noriega, under federal court indictment
in Florida on narcotics and money laundering charges, would stay in
Panama and might retain power behind the scenes.
   Calling the offer a ``noble gesture,'' Solis Palma said Noriega
pledged ``as an officer and a gentleman'' to resign before
presidential elections scheduled for May 1989.
   Solis Palma, who has the title ``minister in charge of the
presidency,'' said he would not accept Noriega's resignation unless
``all of the political forces in the country'' join ``a national
dialogue.''
   Noriega put Solis Palma in office Feb. 26, after President Eric
Arturo Delvalle tried to fire the general and the legislature
dismissed Delvalle instead.
   Delvalle, still recognized by the United States, is hiding in
Panama. His dismissal began a run on Panama's banks and they were
closed the next week.
   Pressure from Washington has included freezing virtually all
Panamanian funds in the United States, including revenue from the
Panama Canal.
   Reagan administration spokesmen rejected the Noriega proposal.
Last week, Noriega turned down a U.S. plan for him to leave Panama
and live in Spain.
   The general said his plan was a ``Panamanian solution'' to the
crisis.
   ``I have no reason to talk to the United States,'' he told
reporters after Solis Palma's speech. ``I talk to Panamanians.''
   Guillermo Cochez, vice president of the Christian Democratic
Party, said the proposed discussion would occur in a panel of 33
members, 22 of them supporting Noriega.
   ``This is not a dialogue,'' he said ``It's just cynicism.''
   Aurelio Barria said: ``The general has to go _ immediately, not
eventually.
   Barria is a leader of the National Civic Crusade, a coalition of
200 business, professional, labor and political groups that called
the general strike. It was organized last June to lead the campaign
against Noriega.
   Solis Palma spoke on television for 30 minutes, devoting all but
the last five minutes to castigating the United States. He accused
Washington of ``economic aggression'' in ``an undeclared state of
war.''
   He claimed the United States wants to renege on the 1977
treaties under which the Panama Canal will be turned over to this
country at midnight Dec. 31, 1999.
   The canal, guarded by about 10,000 U.S. troops, has been
operating normally despite the crisis. The United States sent 300
more soldiers Monday, most of them security personnel.
   Because of increasing hunger, the Rev. Francisco Verar said his
Roman Catholic church in the poor San Miguelito suburb is feeding
more families every day.
   ``If we had not done this there would have been chaos, even
cases of death,'' he said. ``We have people who have gone five, six
days without food.''
   Longshoremen, on strike for more than a week, voted
overwhelmingly Tuesday to stay out but accepted part payment of
back wages despite fears of compromising their position.
   ``There are mothers and fathers who have to feed their
children,'' said Luis Asprilla, a union leader.
   In some parts of Panama City, workers formed vigilante groups to
guard stores and other places of employment. Looting occurred
during street protests against Noriega last week.
