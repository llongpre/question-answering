   As George Bush seeks to overcome his negative
ratings in presidential campaign polls, he might draw hope from
recent history: Ronald Reagan suffered equally low ratings in his
races and overcame them to win.
   But this year there is an important difference, poll analysts
say. While Reagan won by beating opponents who were viewed even
less favorably than he was, Bush faces a far more popular opponent
in Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Dukakis has scored high favorable ratings in polls this spring,
though not as high as Jimmy Carter at his pinnacle of popularity in
June of the 1976 election year. Bush has scored poorly, though not
nearly as poorly as Carter at his nadir in 1980.
   Such measures, taken by asking if poll respondents have a
favorable or unfavorable view of candidates, provide an important
guide to vote-getting ability. A poor score ``means that there's a
chunk of people who don't like you,'' said CBS News pollster
Kathleen A. Frankovic. ``They probably won't vote for you _ unless,
of course, they can't stand the other guy more.''
   Strategists on both sides have focused lately on favorability
ratings, with Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach contending
Bush was ``sitting on some of the highest unfavorable ratings of a
presidential candidate in recent memory.''
   Dach said Tuesday he based that claim on Gallup Poll figures,
but the Gallup Organization said its past figures are not
comparable to its current ones because it changed its questions and
procedures. In other, comparable polls, other candidates have rated
considerably worse than Bush rates now.
   Still, Bush's negative rating is high _ 33 percent favorable to
35 percent unfavorable in a CBS News-New York Times poll in May, 51
percent favorable to 35 percent unfavorable in a May ABC
News-Washington Post poll, 53-40 favorable to unfavorable in a
Gallup poll this week.
   Contrast the ratings for Dukakis: 38-14 favorable to unfavorable
in the CBS-Times poll, 64-11 in the ABC-Post's, 70-20 in Gallup's.
   The general election campaign, though, hardly has begun. ``We're
looking at where these people are starting out,'' Frankovic said.
``Michael Dukakis is starting out very nicely. George Bush is
starting out with as many people disliking him as liking him. So
he's got some work to do.''
   Bush's negatives are by no means historic. All three candidates
in the 1980 and 1984 elections _ Reagan, Carter and Walter Mondale
_ had as bad or worse favorability ratings during their campaigns.
In June 1980, Carter's CBS-Times rating was a dismal 33 favorable
to 60 unfavorable.
   Bush's 33-35 score in the CBS-Times poll was comparable to
Reagan's 38-38 favorability rating in September 1980. But Reagan
had the advantage of facing Carter, the unpopular incumbent.
   While Bush does not have an unpopular opponent, there has been
some movement in Dukakis' rating: He went from 15 percent
unfavorable in a Gallup Poll in May to 20 percent unfavorable the
new Gallup Poll.
   The key issue is not where a candidate stands when considered
alone, but where he stands in relationship to his opponent. ``In
1976 people liked both of them,'' said Frankovic. ``In 1980 they
really didn't like either of them. And in 1984 you had a popular
incumbent.''
   Even Reagan's advantage was not apparent from the start. In
January 1984, an ABC News-Washington Post poll gave Reagan a 54-38
favorable rating and Mondale a 48-30 rating. But 23 percent didn't
know about Mondale; many went against him, and he lost in a
landslide.
   As many, 25 percent, didn't know about Dukakis in the ABC-Post
poll in May, and pollsters noted that his high favorable rating
came amid positive publicity as he chalked up a string of primary
victories over Jesse Jackson.
   ``Dukakis has a quarter of the people who have to get to know
him,'' said Kelly Hanley, an ABC News poll analyst. ``Bush is going
to start talking about Dukakis' record, and we'll see how people
react to that.''
   Bush, with the Republican nomination wrapped up, was out of the
news in May. With voters not yet focused on the race, his rating
may have been more a reflection of Reagan's lagging popularity than
of his own standing.
   ``Those negatives don't represent some personal shortcoming with
George Bush as much as some dissatisfaction with the Reagan
administration,'' said Larry Hugick, of the Gallup Organization.
``I don't think people have much of a sense of Bush and Dukakis yet
to give a response to these questions.''
   The issue for the campaigns, the analysts said, is whether Bush
can establish his own, positive identity separate from Reagan, and
whether he can capitalize on the public's unfamiliarity with
Dukakis.
