   When President Bush looks for votes on Capitol
Hill to sustain a minimum wage bill veto or win passage of his
savings and loan bailout plan, his clout is limited by the fact
most congressmen ran far ahead of him in their districts last
November.
   House members and political analysts differ among themselves on
the impact of Bush's lack of coattails.
   But there is no argument that while Bush was carrying 40 of the
50 states, voters by the millions were opting for divided
government by choosing a Republican president and a Democratic
Congress.
   ``There was a big message in this election and George Bush
picked it up,'' said Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the House
Democratic whip.
   Coelho praised Bush for ``trying to establish a level of trust
that hasn't existed for 12 years.''
   ``You run independent of everyone,'' said Republican Rep. Lynn
Martin of Illinois.
   But she insisted that a president's persuasive ability is not
tied to the results of the last election.
   ``If the president calls you and asks you to vote for something,
any living member of Congress who says it is easy to say no, is
absolutely saying that for a press statement,'' she said. ``After
the election it isn't Democrat or Republican, it's the president.''
   An analysis of the 1988 election results, published in the
National Journal, found that Bush ran ahead of the successful House
candidate in only 56 of the 435 House districts.
   Bush out polled only 26 Republicans and 30 Democrats. Half of
the Democrats were from the South, Bush's strongest region in the
presidential vote.
   While those numbers might be viewed as a sign of the president's
electoral weakness, they might more accurately reflect the strength
of House members. Of the 435 House winners in 1988, only 63
received under 60 percent of the vote.
   By contrast, when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, he ran
ahead of 59 Republican winners. In addition his coattails were
credited with giving Republicans control of the Senate for the
first time in a quarter century and with a GOP pickup of 33 House
seats.
   Did that make a difference?
   ``It was very easy to deal with reluctant Republicans or
persuadable Democrats'' during Reagan's first two years in office,
said Rich Bond, a Republican consultant who was involved in trying
to generate support for Reagan's agenda.
   Reagan's clout on Capitol Hill diminished sharply after the 1982
midterm election when the Democrats won back 26 House seats.
   ``It was back to business as usual,'' said Bond.
   ``I've always been the Republican in whose district our
presidential candidates did least well,'' said Rep. Bill Green of
New York whose district runs along the East Side of Manhattan.
Green was re-elected with 61 percent of the vote, while Bush was
receiving only 33 percent against Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``I was the only Republican elected in a district Reagan didn't
carry in '84,'' said Green.
   Green describes himself as a progressive Republican and his
support for Reagan in House votes declined from a high of 55
percent of the time in 1981 to 38 percent in 1986, according to
Congressional Quarterly.
   The New York congressman said, ``Plainly in 1981 one of the
things Reagan had going for him in winning votes in Congress was
the ability to persuade marginal Democrats in certain parts of the
country that if they didn't come along they'd be very vulnerable in
1982.
   ``Obviously, that kind of capacity is lacking (for Bush) at this
point.''
   Tom Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, said, ``We're getting to the point where there will be
zero correlation between presidential and congressional returns.
   ``It reinforces the view on Capitol Hill that their electoral
fates are not shared with the president and therefore there are no
electoral ties that bind. Whatever incentives they have for working
with the president, elections are not one of them.''
   ``Not many members of Congress are going to quake in their boots
when presidents try to force them to do things,'' said Norman
Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise
Institute.
   ``Presidents win by big margins; presidents win by small
margins; members of Congress go marching on,'' he said.
   Stephen Hess, who served on the White House staffs of presidents
Eisenhower and Nixon, said members of Congress get a sense of a
president's clout in their districts from polls and letters and
from their trips back home.
   ``They don't need to look at last November's election returns to
know how well George Bush stands in their district and, of course,
George Bush probably stands in their district better than he did on
November 8.''
   ``A president is not a hapless giant,'' said Hess. ``There are
appointments members want, there are grants that they want, there
are an awful lot of symbolic things that they want.''
   Lynn Martin echoed that view.
   ``What the president has to offer members is not really
electability,'' she said. ``It's coming in for fund-raisers, it is
the White House, it is members feeling they are working with the
president of the United States to accomplish something.''
