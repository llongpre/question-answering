   President Daniel Ortega has accused the
United States of ordering thousands of rebels to re-enter Nicaragua
and sabotage reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane
Joan.
   Meanwhile, it was reported today that some U.S. charities trying
provide humanitarian relief to Nicaraguans hurt by the hurricane
claim they are being hampering in their efforts by the Reagan
administration.
   ``Taking advantage of the damage, the trauma, the Yankees have
already ordered the infiltration of 3,000 mercenaries into
Nicaraguan territory,'' Ortega said Friday in a nationwide radio and
television address.
   In Washington, State Department press officer Anita Stockman
denied the allegations. ``No U.S. military aid is being provided to
the Contras at this time,'' she said, referring to the rebels.
   Rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros said in Washington that the
Contras were receiving only U.S. humanitarian aid.
   ``The fact is Mr. Ortega is trying to conceal the continuous
buildup they have carried out with the help of Cuba and the Soviet
Union,'' Matamoros said.
   Ortega said the Reagan administration had re-armed the rebels,
known as Contras, and instructed them to ``sabotage and slow
reconstruction work and delay the coffee harvest,'' economically
vital to Nicaragua's already staggering economy.
   ``Facing a threat such as this when we are facing the
consequences of this hurricane, Nicaraguans are obliged to mobilize,
organize, to fulfill the job of defending the country,'' Ortega said.
   Some private U.S. organizations complained the Reagan
administration has refused to assist their efforts to deliver
donated goods to Nicaragua and has even threatened to declare
shipments of construction supplies illegal under the U.S. economic
embargo of the country.
   ``It's kind of appalling that the White House and the State
Department are interfering in the process of disaster aid,'' Richard
M. Walden, president of Operation California, a Los Angeles-based
relief group organizing an airlift to Nicaragua next week, was
quoted as saying today in the Los Angeles Times.
   White House and State Department officials denied any deliberate
effort to block private aid, but they acknowledged the
administration has taken few steps to assist the charities, the
Times said.
   The Soviet-backed Sandinista government and the U.S.-supported
Contras agreed in March to halt offensive operations in their 7-year
civil war. The government unilaterally has extended the truce on a
month-to-month basis. The current extension ends Monday.
   Ortega offered no proof of his allegations and did not say that
mobilization meant the government was allowing the cease-fire to
lapse.
   Most of the Contras retreated to base camps in Honduras after the
U.S. Congress refused to renew arms aid. Legislation approved by
Congress does allow delivery of food, shelter, clothing and medical
services to the rebels.
   The leftist government frequently has compared the effort to
survive last week's killer hurricane to its struggle against the
Contras. On Friday, Ortega repeated his assertion that an end to
Contra aid would be the best hurricane assistance the United States
could offer.
   Citing the latest government data, Ortega said Hurricane Joan
left 103 dead and 186,950 homeless. Previous government figures
estimated the number of dead at more than 60, with about 300,000
homeless.
   Ortega said 110 people were missing, an additional 178 were
seriously hurt and 324,861 were evacuated from their homes; 29,152
homes were destroyed; 33 bridges were destroyed and 33 others
damaged, and 400 miles of roads suffered direct damage.
   The cattle and fishing industries, and rice, cotton, grain,
sugar, cacao and African palm crops suffered serious damage and
``unmeasurable'' ecological damage was done, Ortega said.
   The storm ripped across 200 miles of Nicaraguan territory from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.
   ``The data indicate we met our main goal, to save lives,'' Ortega
said.
   He thanked Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Britain and the European
Economic Community for their aid and said East Germany and the
Soviet Union also promised help.
   The president called the aid ``necessary and urgent.''
