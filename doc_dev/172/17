   _ White voters were narrowly split between Michael Dukakis and
Albert Gore Jr., 34 percent to 33 percent. But Jesse Jackson's 10
percent share of the white vote helped him roll to victory in
several deep South states.
   _ Black voters favored Jackson by margins of 95 percent or
higher.
   _ Hispanics gave 42 percent of their votes to Dukakis, 23
percent to Jackson.

percent. Jackson had three percent of the Jewish vote, as did

would not vote for him. Thirty-seven percent expressed the same
sentiment about George Bush, 36 percent about Gary Hart and 29
percent about Jackson.
   _ Eighty-two percent of Democratic voters said the next
president should change the course set by Reagan; among them, 33
percent were for Jackson, 29 percent Dukakis and 22 percent Gore.

   _ The youngest voters and those in their 50s were George Bush's
biggest supporters. Those age 18-24 favored Bush over Dole by 73
percent to 11 percent, while those in their 50s picked him by 65
percent to 14 percent.
   _ Dole's worst showing was among high school graduates and
dropouts, where he trailed Bush by 60-17; his best was among those
with more than four years of college, where he narrowed the gap to
50-33.

   _ Among born-again Christians, Bush beat Robertson, 46-33, with
Dole third at 14 percent and Kemp at 5 percent. Among white
born-agains, Bush was the choice, 44-34, over Robertson. Among
evangelicals, Bush was the choice by 48-28 over Dole, with
Robertson third at 18 percent and Kemp last at 5 percent.

themselves liberals or moderates, but 16 percent of the
conservatives. His conservative votes came at Dole's expense.

candidates they definitely would not vote for. Forty-two percent

Simon and 21 percent Dukakis.
   _ Seventy-nine percent wanted to stay the Reagan course; they
favored Bush 64-17 over Dole, with 13 percent for Robertson and 5
percent for Dole. Among the 21 percent who want a change, Bush led

percent over Bush and Robertson, both 22 percent.
   _ Among those who considered the candidates' stands on abortion
crucial, Robertson tied Bush with 40 percent.
   _ Eighty percent of Jews went for Bush, 20 percent for Dole.
   The ABC exit polls had a standard margin of error of five points
in either direction. ABC interviewed voters as they exited 690
precincts around the Super Tuesday states. It questioned at least
1,000 voters in each Republican primary state and 700 in the
Democratic primaries.
   Many of these results were based on an extended questionnaire
given to voters at 50 precincts across the South.
