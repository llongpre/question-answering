   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will make
another visit to the United States next month to address the United
Nations and will meet with President Reagan, U.S. officials said
Monday.
   Gorbachev also is expected to meet with President-elect George
Bush while he is in New York.
   The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
a report by CBS.
   Earlier, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa would visit London Dec. 12-14.
   Reagan met with Gorbachev in Washington last December, the third
of their four summit meetings. They signed a treaty to abolish U.S.
and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Bush said last week he was interested in a meeting with Gorbachev
if it could produce progress on arms control, human rights or
regional disputes.
   But first, Bush said, he would have James A. Baker III, who he
has named his choice for secretary of state, meet with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and with foreign ministers
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Bush ruled out a mere get-acquainted session. ``I am acquainted
with him,'' the president-elect said. ``What I want to see is
progress. I`ve never supported meetings just for the sake of having
meetings.''
   Reagan first met with Gorbachev in Geneva, Switzerland, in
November 1985. They held their second summit in 1986 in Iceland,
then met in Washington last December and in Moscow May 29-June 2.
   The two superpowers are close to an agreement to sharply reduce
their strategic nuclear weapons, but are wrestling with problems
over how to verify some of the cutbacks.
   On the regional front, the Soviets have suspended the withdrawal
of their troops from Afghanistan. But the pullout is not supposed to
completed until Feb. 15, and Reagan administration officials have
expressed confidence the Soviets would meet the deadline.
   Phyllis Oakley, the State Department spokeswoman, said of a
Gorbachev visit: ``There has been no official announcement from the
U.S.S.R. on this question. Therefore it is inappropriate for us to
comment now.''
