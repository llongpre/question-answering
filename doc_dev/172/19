   Americans want the United Nations, not
national governments, to control nuclear and chemical weapons and
to take the lead in keeping peace in the world, according to a poll
released Wednesday.
   The Roper Organization survey also found strong support for
increased American financing of U.N. programs for peace, food
production, population control and health.
   In conflicts among countries where the United States has an
interest, U.N. forces should be used in an effort to accommodate
all parties, said 49 percent of the nearly 2,000 adults surveyed.
   Only 17 percent said the United States should use force to
impose its own solution; 20 percent said ``it depends,'' and 14
percent had no opinion.
   ``That is, in effect, a tough policy choice, and we were
surprised to see a 3-to-1 margin of support for U.N. intervention
rather than unilateral U.S. intervention,'' said Jeffrey Laurenti
of the U.N. Association of the U.S.A., a private non-profit group
that commissioned the poll.
   Of the respondents, 46 percent wanted America and other U.N.
members to spend more money settling regional conflicts peacefully,
11 percent favored less spending, 31 percent said the right amount
is spent now, and 11 percent had no opinion.
   The United Nations should have the power to control the
manufacture and spread of chemical weapons in the United States and
other countries, said 49 percent, but 33 percent opposed that and
18 percent were unsure.
   U.N. control over nuclear weapons manufacture and proliferation
was favored by 36 percent. The same percentage opposed it and 18
percent were unsure.
   Sixty percent said all U.N. members should pay their full dues
regularly rather than withholding funds to force changes. Fourteen
percent said funds could be withheld, the same number said ``it
depends'' and 12 percent had no opinion.
   President Reagan and Congress withheld more than a $500 million
from the United Nations in recent years to force fiscal reforms and
because they perceived an anti-Western bias in the organization.
   Reagan finally said the United States would pay all back dues if
current reforms continued, and President Bush has reaffirmed the
pledge.
   When asked how much money the United States and other U.N.
member countries should spend on U.N. projects, the respondents
favored more funds for most social programs, including eradicating
disease and improving health care; slowing population growth
through birth control; increasing world food production, and
protecting the environment.
   Burns Roper, head of the Roper Organization, said the poll
indicated for the first time in more than a decade that more
Americans thought the United Nations was doing a good job than felt
it was doing poorly.
   It was conducted March 11-18 through personal interviews with
nearly 2,000 adults chosen at random. Roper said the margin of
error was about 3 percent.
