   President Reagan said Thursday the United
States is not going to play ``big colossus of the North'' and use
military force to get Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega out of power.
   In a question-and-answer session with high school students in
this Washington suburb, Reagan was asked if he thought it would be
necessary to resume U.S. military control in Panama to protect the
safety of the canal zone.
   ``No, we're going to abide by the canal treaty (relinquishing
the canal to the Panamanians by the turn of the century),'' he
replied. ``And we're not going to be the big colossus of the North
once again, coming in to ... our smaller neighbors' places of
living and business and trying to guide and direct them.''
   The president said the Panamanians ``have a very difficult
problem there. We think that they're moving toward solving it with
the reaction of the people to the man that has caused so much of
this problem.''
   Reagan said the United States wants ``to be of help in any way
we can, and so we've helped them in that regard in the economic
restraints that we've put down there so that there can be pressure
focused on this particular individual.''
   ``But there's no danger of us coming in with our power and
muscle and saying, `This is the way it has to be.'''
   Meanwhile, the federal Agency for International Development has
agreed to release $250,000 in emergency funds to buy food for the
poor in Panama.
   The food will be purchased in Panama if it is available and
distributed through Caritas, a Catholic relief agency said AID
spokesman Jim Kunder.
   Panama is out of cash because Washington cut off the supply of
U.S. dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to drive
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega into exile. The general was indicted in
the United States last month on federal cocaine trafficking charges.
   The Panamanian government was unable to fully meet a $33 million
payroll for 130,000 public employees earlier this month, touching
off a series of strikes and massive demonstrations by workers once
considered loyal to Noriega.
