   The government said it ordered its
soldiers not to give Washington a pretext for armed intervention
and it failed to meet another payroll for civil servants, dampening
Easter celebrations.
   Thousands of people lined up for meals provided by charity,
casualties of the 5-week-old campaign to try to force the ouster of
Panama's de facto leader, Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The office of acting President Manuel Solis Palma issued a
communique Thursday alleging the United States was looking for an
incident that could justify military intervention.
   It cited a letter from Solis to Javier Perez de Cuellar, the
U.N. secretary-general, that said recent U.S. military movements in
Panama and its territorial waters constituted a security threat.
   ``The Defense Forces of Panama have orders to refrain from using
lethal or destructive weapons at any time against the armed forces
of the United States or against U.S. civilians or against property
or installations of citizens or the government of the United
States,'' the communique says.
   Solis was apparently referring to the passage of the U.S.
helicopter carrier Okinawa through the Panama Canal this week and
military exercises being conducted by troops stationed at the U.S.
Southern Command in Panama.
   ``Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic
of Panama ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a
charge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching of
acts of war,'' Solis said. ``Under no circumstances will Panama
allow itself to be provoked nor will it lend itself to the
fabrication of an incident.''
   It mentions the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983, which the
Reagan administration said was necessary to protect U.S. students
there.
   On Monday night, police and soldiers arrested and beat several
foreign journalists, including Americans, during a raid on a Panama
City hotel. The next day, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
condemned the incident.
   ``It has always been a principle that we will protect American
citizens as best we can. And while we have said that we don't plan
to go in (to Panama) militarily, it is also important to note that
there are limits,'' he said.
   The government shut down on Thursday for the Easter weekend
without paying most of its 130,000 public employees for the second
time in a month.
   It failed to meet the $33 million payroll despite the collection
this week of $19 million in quarterly tax revenues. About $5.5
million was said to be taxes and fees from U.S. companies doing
business in Panama.
   In Washington, the Senate voted 92-1 for a resolution urging
President Reagan to cut off the flow of money from U.S.
corporations to the regime of Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment
on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine.
   Most Panamanians are short of cash and food as a result of an
11-day-old general strike and the cash crisis, which was caused in
part by a U.S. freeze on millions of dollars of Panamanian assets
in American banks.
   The sanctions were imposed after the Noriega-orchestrated ouster
Feb. 26 of President Eric Arturo Delvalle in retaliation for
Delvalle's attempt to fire Noriega.
   Banks have been closed since March 3.
   With most businesses and industries observing the general
strike, the largest congregations of people were found in the food
lines of welfare agencies.
   The Rev. Laurino Duran, head of a Roman Catholic Church relief
society, said his organization was feeding 9,000 families a day.
   ``The number is growing daily,'' the priest said, adding that
the effort is costing $600,000 a month, which the church receives
in donated cash and food.
   Leaders of the National Civic Crusade were meeting to plan new
strategies in their frustrated effort to oust Noriega.
   ``We'll be talking over the weekend, discussing where we go from
here,'' said Roberto Aleman, an attorney and director of the
Crusade, a coalition of about 200 professional, business, labor,
political and other groups.
