<HEAD>Gadhafi Says He'll Return Body Of American Killed In 1986 Raid</HEAD>

   Col. Moammar Gadhafi said he is willing to hand over
the body of a U.S. pilot killed during the 1986 air raid on Libya,
the official news agency JANA reported today.
   Gadhafi said the body of Capt. Paul Lorence would be given to his
family ``through the pope,'' said the agency, monitored in London
and Rome.
   Lorence, 31, of San Francisco, and Fernando Ribas-Dominicci, 33,
of Utuado, Puerto Rico, were in an F-111 that disappeared during the
April 15, 1986, raid on Tripoli and Benghazi. The other 17 U.S. Air
Force bombers returned safely to their bases after dropping about
100 tons of bombs on the two cities.
   The attack was in retaliation for what the Reagan administration
said was Libya's support for international terrorism. Libyan
authorities said the raids killed about 40 people, including
Gadhafi's 15-month-old adopted daughter.
   ``The brother leader has also invited the family of the U.S.
pilot (Capt. Paul) Lorence, whose plane was shot down during the
failed U.S. barbaric and savage attack on Tripoli and Benghazi ...
to take possession of his body which will be handed through the pope
(of the Vatican), especially since this occasion coincides with the
end of the rule of the Reagan administration, the `murderer of
children,''' the JANA dispatch said.
   It said he made the comments to a group of Arab Christians.
   At the Vatican, deputy spokesman Giovanni D'ercole said the Roman
Catholic Church had no immediate comment.
   After the 1986 raids, diplomats in Libya said Gadhafi was
demanding a ransom or concessions from the United States before
returning the airman's body.
   Three months after the attack, Libyan television showed pictures
of a body it said was Lorence.
   Western witnesses reported seeing an F-111 crash into the
Mediterranean Sea soon after being hit, apparently by a missile,
during the raid on Tripoli.
   Relations between the United States and Libya have been more
strained than usual lately. President Reagan has charged Libya has
constructed a plant to produce chemical weapons, and has said
Washington was talking with its allies about a possible attack on
the facility.
   Gadhafi has claimed the plant produces pharmaceuticals.
