   Vice President Dan Quayle, embarking on a 12-day
trip to Australia and Southeast Asia, vowed Monday to address
``head-on ... concerns that the United States is a nation in
decline.''
   Before leaving the United States on his second trip abroad since
taking office, Quayle addressed the annual meeting of The
Associated Press.
   He told the newspaper publishers his trip to Asia was designed
to underscore the U.S. commitment to the Pacific rim and gain
``firsthand familiarity'' with the area.
   Moreover, he said some American and Asian observers wonder if
the United States ``is really a great nation in decline,'' with
high budget and trade deficits a sign of malaise.
   Those observers ask themselves, ``Can we (the United States)
still be relied on to play a leadership role in the Pacific? And,
if not, who else is there to replace us?
   ``An important purpose of my trip is to address these concerns
head on ...,'' Quayle said. ``The United States is focusing on the
region as never before.''
   He said he intends to remind the Asian allies ``that the current
wave of `declinist' thought in the United States is hardly a new
phenomenon.''
   Elaborating, the vice president said, ``Books predicting
America's imminent fall from world leadership have made the
best-seller list and prophets of American decline have become
virtual academic celebrities.
   ``All of this naturally arouses a good deal of apprehension
among our friends and allies in Asia.''
   He did not identify any ``declinists'' by name.
   Periodically, he said, waves of pessimism have swept the United
States. Yet, he added, such national introspection is healthy
because ``it's usually a sign of renewal, not of decline.''
   Quayle said the overall purpose of his whirlwind trip, which
will take him and his wife, Marilyn, to Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand as well as Australia, is to show that the United States
intends ``to play an important role in the Pacific.''
   In a question-and-answer session with the AP group, Quayle said
one of the things he's most enjoyed about his first 100 days in
office is his involvement in foreign policy.
   The vice president, who visited Central and South America soon
after he was inaugurated, said most of his trips as senator had
been back home to Indiana.
   From Chicago, Quayle flew to Los Angeles to meet with former
President Ronald Reagan before he left for Australia.
   Quayle and his wife met briefly with Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
at Reagan's office in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Posing for
photographers, Quayle presented a wrapped American flag to Reagan,
the same flag that had flown over the American embassy in Kabal,
Afghanistan, until the Soviet troops invaded in 1979.
   When the Soviets announced their attention to leve Afghanistan,
the flag was once again hoisted above the embassy on May 15, 1988.
   ``I'm very proud to have this...I have a feeling this will find
its way into the Ronald Reagan library,'' said the smiling former
Reagan.
   Reagan also said he thought President Bush had done a good job
in the first 100 days. ``He is there to keep in progress the things
we did for eight years,'' Reagan said.
   Later in the evening, Quayle was to receive an award presented
by Reagan's financial backers at a Republican fund-raiser.
   On his return to the United States, Quayle will tour Alaska's
Prince William Sound to see for himself cleanup efforts after the
March 24 grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez, which dumped 10.1
million gallons of crude oil in the sound.
   Trade, space, defense, environmental pollution and chemical
warfare were issues Quayle said he would bring up with U.S. allies.
   His journey, in which he will combine substantive talks with
sightseeing and social events, is taking place shortly before the
first Sino-Soviet summit in 20 years. Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is visiting China in May.
   ``We recognize the Soviet interest in sharing in Asia's economic
boom and in increasing its access to the region,'' he said.
   ``But Moscow has a long way to go to achieve that goal,'' he
said.
   However, he said, the Soviets continue to modernize military
forces in Asia and has one of its largest fleets stationed in Asia.
