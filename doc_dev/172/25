   The special relationship forged between Britain
and the United States during Ronald Reagan's presidency will thrive
under George Bush but on a more businesslike footing, analysts
predict.
   That relationship is likely to be nurtured at the annual NATO
summit in Brussels, beginning Monday.
   Mrs. Thatcher is siding with Bush in a dispute with West Germany
over short-range nuclear missiles in Europe. West Germany has
demanded that the West open negotiations with the East to reduce
the number of missiles, while the United States and Britain want to
modernize the weapons.
   After the summit, and a stop in Bonn, West Germany, Bush is
scheduled to travel to London on Thursday for talks with Mrs.
Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher had made a point of meeting with Bush during his
two terms as vice president, and following his election in November
described him as a ``worthy successor'' to Reagan.
   Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher were ideological soul mates who
operated on a first-name basis and with obvious personal warmth
during the eight years that their conservative administrations
overlapped.
   Things aren't likely to be as folksy with Bush.
   ``I don't think the chemistry's going to be there,'' said John
Young, faculty member of the London School of Economics
international history department.
   ``I think there's going to be less warmth there. I think there
was genuine mutual admiration between Ronald Reagan and Margaret
Thatcher because they are kind of believing people,'' Young said.
   ``They believe in a cause to fight for and they admire each
other for standing up and fighting ... President Bush, through his
background, is far more a wheeler-dealer kind of character,'' he
said.
   Charles H. Price II, Reagan's ambassador to Britain, predicted
Bush's relations with Mrs. Thatcher will be even closer than his
predecessor's because both are ``hands-on'' managers.
   ``I think with George Bush, in a sense, she will have a more
special relationship than Ronald Reagan had,'' Price told American
reporters before returning to the United States.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger agreed, telling
Britain's Sky Television:
   ``The relationship, good as it was between President Reagan and
Mrs. Thatcher, will be at least as good, if not better, between
President Bush and Prime Minister Thatcher.
   ``Mr. Reagan based his relationship very much on personal
intuition,'' Kissinger said. ``President Bush is a man who is more
reflective about the conceptual matters.''
   Peter Jay, Britain's ambassador to Washington from 1977-79, said
personal relations between leaders has little impact on policy or
decision making.
   But he pinpointed one factor that he said could make Bush's
relations with the British leader different from Reagan's.
   ``President Bush actually knows about and is interested in
government and Mrs. Thatcher knows about and is interested in
government both at the national and international level,'' Jay said.
   Mrs. Thatcher has regularly backed the United States _ sometimes
alone.
   Britain was the first to deploy U.S. cruise missiles in Europe
in 1983, and it was the only ally to support the 1986 U.S. bombing
raid on Libya.
   Despite her personal reservations, Mrs. Thatcher publicly
endorsed the 1987 U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove the missiles, and
in January, Royal Air Force Base Molesworth, 50 miles north of
London, became the first NATO cruise missile base to be disarmed.
   Reagan, in turn, approved vital arms supplies and intelligence
to Britain during the 1982 Falkland Islands War against Argentina.
