   Implementing the ``Brilliant Pebbles''
space-based defense plan could reduce the $69.1 billion pricetag
attached to the early development stage of Star Wars research, says
a Pentagon official.
   Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr., director of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, told members of the Senate Appropriations
defense subcommittee Thursday that Brilliant Pebbles could trim the
cost of Phase I of Star Wars. He did not provide specifics.
   The United States has invested about $17 billion in SDI,
commonly known as Star Wars, and members of the Senate panel
expressed reservations about the direction and the high price of he
research program.
   ``The members of Congress and their constituents must ask
themselves whether the nation can afford SDI and whether the return
on the investment is justified,'' said Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, chairman of the subcommittee.
   Inouye called current spending on Star Wars ``robust,'' and said
the $17 billion ``could have been funded in other weapons.''
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, criticized the research program as
``ill-defined with conflicting goals.''
   ``Ronald Reagan told us SDI is to protect people. It looks like
we're going to protect missiles,'' Harkin said.
   But Monahan sought to assure the lawmakers as he described the
Brilliant Pebbles process and the Pentagon's current plans.
   Monahan said the Defense Science Board and the Jasons, a group
of university professors, mostly physicists, will review the
concept for the department this summer.
   ``This fall, subsequent to Brilliant Pebbles study efforts ...
we will reexamine our space-based architecture with a view toward
the degree of incorporation of this concept,'' Monahan said.
   Under the system, 3,000 to 5,000 satellites, about three feet
long and weighing less than 100 pounds each, would be placed in
orbit about 400 miles above the Earth.
   Brilliant Pebbles is supported by outgoing SDI chief, Lt. Gen.
James Abrahamson, who predicted in a Feb. 9 memorandum that it
could be deployed in space for about $25 billion, far less than the
estimates of $45 billion for other SDI orbital systems.
   Monahan said recent budget cuts have forced the Pentagon to
delay work on some Star Wars research, including a six-month slip
in development of a tracking satellite and a two-year delay in a
demonstration experiment.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed cutting the fiscal
1990 budget for Star Wars from the $5.9 billion called for by
former President Reagan to $4.6 billion.
   Overall, five-year spending on Star Wars would be cut from $41
billion to $33 billion.
   In an appearance last month before the House Armed Services
Committee, Cheney said money for Star Wars ``will buy us the
capability to look aggressively at Brilliant Pebbles.''
   ``If Brilliant Pebbles does not work out, the ultimate
deployment date of the current space-based missile program would
slip by two years,'' Cheney said. He did not set a date.
