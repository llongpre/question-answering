   Chinese students said they feared being shipped
back to their homeland after the Senate upheld President Bush's
veto of a bill protecting them from deportation when their visas
expire.
   ``Many students fear they will be sent back. I'm scared for all
my friends,'' said Yuan Liu, 30, a Chinese student enrolled at
Brandeis University.
   ``I think it's a sad day for us,'' said Pei Min Xin, 33, a
doctoral student at Harvard University who led the pro-democracy
protests in Beijing last spring. ``I'm afraid that the president
will continue his policy of accommodating the Chinese dictators.''
   Bush said the bill to eliminate that requirement was unnecessary
because he has signed an administrative order allowing Chinese
students to stay in the United States.
   The president said the legislation could have damaged U.S.
relations with China, which has condemned the action and threatened
to curtail exchange programs if it becomes law.
   The Senate voted 62-37 Thursday to override the presidential
veto, four votes short of the two-thirds necessary. The House voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to reject Bush's veto.
   Xiaxia Gong, 33, a Harvard graduate student, was among several
Chinese students gathered at the China Information Center in Newton
who said the failed legislation would have given them a sense of
security.
   Many of the students fled to the United States after the Chinese
government cracked down on the protests in Tiananmen Square. Under
the visa's requirements, bearers must return to China when their
visas expire and live there for two years before they can apply for
a new one.
   The students fear that the president's order could be reversed
someday, leaving them vulnerable to deportation to their homeland
where they might be jailed.
   ``I don't believe Mr. Bush,'' Gong said. ``How can we believe
someone who has already cheated and sent high-level officials to
China when he said he would not? We don't want our destiny put in
someone else's hands.''
   In Salem, Ore., Chinese students at Oregon State University said
they couldn't understand the Senate vote.
   ``It did send a message to China, but it did not stand for human
rights,'' Wang De Qian, co-vice president of the university's
Chinese student association.
   Shu Ouang said the student association ``did not want to
override the president, but the veto. We want to send a stronger
message to the Chinese butchers.''
