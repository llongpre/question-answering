   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with 1,204 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult
resident of each home who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that
theoretically the results would be within 3 percentage points of
the same 19 times out of 20 if every adult American were asked the
same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five
points for Republicans, for example, and nine points for
respondents who have done postgraduate work.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll:
   1. Do you think the president of the United States and the
leader of the Soviet Union should meet at regular intervals even

know or no answer: 6 percent.

to abolish each country's medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
