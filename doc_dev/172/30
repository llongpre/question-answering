<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Seidlitz: "Triumph of the Realists"] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton's decision to renew the 
most-favored-nation [MFN] clause will have a favorable effect on 
trade and cooperation between the United States and China. This 
is the gist of a statement published by the Chinese Government 
in Beijing as a reaction. 
  The business-like statement does not reflect the overt 
triumph the Chinese Government feels. A few days before the 
fifth anniversary of the clearing of Tienanmen Square, which 
claimed at least several hundred if not thousands of lives on 4 
June 1989, the United States has now also joined those who 
follow the popular slogan of "business first." The Europeans 
assumed such a pragmatic position a long time ago. Li Peng, 
China's head of government who held his own with his tough 
course in 1989, forcing reform-minded CPC head Zhao Zhiang into 
political exile, is expected on official visits in Austria, 
Germany, and Romania. That is realpolitik. 
  President Clinton decided that trade and human rights would 
henceforth be separated. This ends the annual tug-of-war about 
the renewal of tariff privileges. One year ago, the same 
President still linked the two issues and explicitly made the 
granting of preferential trade treatment dependent on an 
improvement of the human rights situation in China and Tibet. 
  Under the pressure of Big Business, the United States has 
now 
backed out and admitted its helplessness. After all, if the 
West is not even able to intervene in the cruel massacres in 
Africa and the Balkans, exerting pressure on China, which is 
bursting with strength, is absolutely impossible. 
  The renewal of the tariff privileges means that Chinese 
consumer goods -- such as shoes, clothes, toys, electronic 
equipment -- remain cheap in the United States. The United 
States is China's biggest market. Products worth $33 billion go 
from China to the United States. Investments and trade are 
helping China to modernize the country. In the best case, this 
will in time lead to political transformation. There is no 
alternative. Nobody can wish for political chaos in the 
overpopulated country. 
  Reversely, U.S. and multinational concerns, the U.S. service 
sector enterprises such as banks and bond houses, and even 
fastfood restaurants such as McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
Pizza Hut, and Burger King, are now hoping for big business. So 
far, as with Japan, the United States has had a huge trade 
balance deficit with China. The United States only sells 
products worth $8 million to China. According to reports, China 
is said to order 50 Boeing aircraft in a single mammoth order 
worth $5 billion in return, so to speak, for granting the tariff 
privileges. The resumption of military contacts with the 
objective of armament sales has also been initiated. 
  The U.S. business world is, therefore, satisfied with 
President Clinton's decision. And Hong Kong rejoices, too. 
After all, the bulk of exports to China is shipped through this 
city, which will be a British colony until 1997. Hong Kong 
would have lost enormous transactions. After this political 
U-turn, the Americans argue that changes or an easing of the 
politically tense situation would be achieved through economic 
relations rather than through political pressure. The slogan is 
change through business.
