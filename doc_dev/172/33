   Twenty lawmakers from the opposition Labor Party
filed a statement in the House of Commons on Monday expressing
pleasure that Ronald Reagan is no longer president of the United
States.
   The statement referred to Reagan's ``obsession'' with the
space-based defense system known as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, or ``Star Wars,'' and said the signatories were upset
``at the wars he has promoted in Central America, the bombing of
Libya, the invasion of Grenada and the sending of troops to the
Middle East''.
   ``We call for the U.S.A. to announce a disarmament program and to
cease interfering in the affairs of other countries,'' the statement
said.
   It said the lawmakers noted ``with pleasure that Ronald Reagan
has ceased to be president of the United States.''
