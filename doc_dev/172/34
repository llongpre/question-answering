   The government on Wednesday listed 389
charities, including several controversial ones, that will take
part in a massive employee solicitation drive that raises about
$160 million a year from federal workers.
   A homosexual group, the Lambda Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, is among 19 groups whose applications were included in the
Combined Federal Campaign after initially being turned down.
   ``I assume, frankly, that there was simply a desire to keep
Lambda out of the circle by virtue of its mission,'' defending
homosexuals and homosexual rights in court, said executive director
Thomas Stoddard.
   ``Frankly, it is a thrilling prospect for us,'' he said. ``Being
listed helps fulfill our mission.''
   He said his was the first overtly homosexual group to win the
right to participate. He said he could not anticipate how much
money would come to the group since designating it as a charitable
recipience ``may be viewed by the employee as one degree of coming
out.'' The fund, with a $1 million budget, was established in 1972.
   Constance Newman, director of the Office of Personnel
Management, said that after personally reviewing rejected
applications, she approved 19 rejected organizations, gave
qualified approval to eight, left six pending and denied approval
to 55, of which 33 had not complied with requests for additional
information.
   Those given qualified approval for one year spend more than 25
percent of their receipts on administrative and fund-raising costs,
normally grounds for exclusion.
   Approval went to a range of causes, some potentially
controversial. Among them are the Firearms Civil Rights Legal
Defense Fund, the United Palestinian Appeal, Human Life
International, the National Association of Black Law Enforcement
Executives, United States Military Sports Association, the Living
Bank and Operation California.
   Anti-abortion groups, such as the National Right to Life
Educational Trust Fund, and abortion rights groups, such as the
Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights Education Fund and Planned
Parenthood-World Population, already were listed. So were such
conservative groups as the National Right to Work Legal Defense
Foundation, Inc., and such liberal outfits as People for the
American Way.
   Being listed can bring large amounts of money to an organization
at virtually no cost _ or it can bring nothing if employees do not
specifically designate the charity.
   The fund drive raises over $160 million from 4 million federal
employees, including military people and postal workers, with the
average giving $60.68.
   It is the largest employee solicitation in the country, OPM
said, although Americans individually gave $87 billion to churches
and charities in 1988, according to the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel.
   Federal employees may designate up to five charities from a list
that, when local groups are included, in some instances numbers as
many as 1,000.
   About 80 percent of the gifts are designated. Of the rest, about
82 percent goes to the local United Way campaign, 7 percent to a
group of 33 international service agencies, 7 percent to national
health agencies and 4 percent to local groups, according to OPM.
   Former President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order in 1983
restricting the federal drive to traditional health and welfare
charities. But after protests and lawsuits by advocacy groups,
Congress in 1986 enacted legislation broadening the grounds for
admission but giving the OPM director discretion.
