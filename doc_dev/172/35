   Looking back on nearly eight years as president,
Ronald Reagan said with a short, dry laugh that his greatest
achievement may have been staying alive.
   The 77-year-old U.S. chief executive, who was shot in the chest
in 1981, commented in the second of a three-part series on his
presidency broadcast Friday on British television's independent
Channel 4.
   David Gergen, former White House spokesman, said the public
attitude toward Reagan changed after the assassination attempt.
   ``You may not agree with him. You may think he's too simple .. .
not a man of the world, but there is a sense of conviction about
him,'' Gergen said. ``A strength of character emerges in the
shooting which transforms his presence.''
   The 50-minute program called ``Walking Tall'' covers Reagan's
first term.
   It starts with former aide Michael Deaver recalling that he
found his boss sleeping under a mound of bedcovers on the morning
of his inauguration, Jan. 20, 1981.
   ``I said, `Governor.' There was kind of a grunt,'' Deaver said.
``And I said `Good God, in an hour and a half you're going to be
sworn in as the 40th president of the United States.' He rolled
over and said, `Do I have to?'.''
   Much of the program focused on assessments by political analysts
and former members of Reagan's administration.
   To Howard Baker, former White House chief of staff, ``Ronald
Reagan is the most presidential man I've ever known. That will be
his principal legacy. And by that I mean he knows exactly who he
is. He is president of the United States and he has no trouble with
that. He is not offended by it, upset by it or intimidated by it.''
   Stuart Spencer, a long-time adviser, said: ``Nobody in American
politics has better style and form than Ronald Reagan.''
   Howard Philips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus political
group, called him ``the most typical, the most American, the most
average _ but in a good sense, in a likeable sense _ president we
could ever imagine.''
   The president's policies of increasing defense spending, cutting
social programs and refusing to raise taxes came in for tough
criticism.
   Reagan was asked how he responded to the fact that he never
balanced the budget and the United States now is the world's
biggest debtor nation.
   ``I'm just as critical of it as I was before I got here,'' he
replied.
   Donald Regan, former treasury secretary and chief of staff, said
the president never discussed economics or finance with him. Regan
said Congress made budget cuts almost impossible.
   David Stockman, the former budget director who urged Reagan to
raise taxes, had a harsh assessment:
   ``After time, when the full extent of the damage is clear, and
the heavy price we will pay for years to come is evident,
historians will record Reaganomics as the singular greatest episode
of sustained economic mismanagement in the 20th century history of
the United States.''
   Regan called that ``sour grapes on the part of David Stockman''
and added: ``He never got what he wanted, which was solely to have
taxes raised. ... That was not an antidote to get us out of
recession'' in 1982.
   Some of the first term's major events were shown, including the
assassination attempt, the October 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine
barracks in Beirut that killed 243 military personnel and the
invasion of Grenada two days later.
   Recalling the assassination attempt, Reagan said: ``I heard what
I thought was firecrackers. ... I didn't feel a bullet hit me.''
   When asked what was his greatest achievement, he said:
``Sometimes I think,'' then laughed and continued, ``just staying
alive.''
   Even Reagan's critics praised his ability to control the media.
   ``These people have understood that they have a powerful
instrument of news management in their hand,'' said Richard
Neustadt, a Harvard University professor and author of
``Presidential Power,'' who described Reagan's mastery of the photo
opportunity and disdain of formal news conferences.
