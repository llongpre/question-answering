   The leading industrial democracies plan to
take joint steps against terrorism and to assist Third World debtor
nations at their eocnomic summit next week in Toronto.
   Exercising the ``no-place-to-hide'' doctrine, the United States
and its six partners are expected to call on nations worldwide to
deny refueling to airplane hijackers, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said Wednesday.
   The idea is to prevent hostage-holders from taking off with
their victims, Shultz said in a U.S. Information Agency telecast
and at a White House news conference.
   ``It's a specific thing that if given broad endorsement might be
helpful,'' he said.
   Shultz said joint action at past economic summit meetings had
helped send terrorism into a decline in Western Europe, although he
said there also were indications it might be on the rise elsewhere.
   Sharing the White House platform with Shultz, Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III predicted ``there's going to be real action on
economic issues,'' including decisions to ease the debt burden of
sub-Saharan African nations.
   Also, Baker said President Reagan and the leaders of Canada,
Britain, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany would consider
cooperative measures to prevent drug dealers from laundering their
profits through legitimate banks and ways for governments to share
intelligence information on narcotics.
   On another front, however, Shultz indicated the United States
would resist any attempt to impose stiffer economic sanctions
against South Africa because of its racial policies.
