   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said Friday that
Oliver North was the ``scapegoat'' for crimes committed by the U.S.
government and the person who really should be tried is former
President Reagan.
   North was convicted Thursday of three felony counts in
connection with the Iran-Contra case, which shadowed the last two
years of the Reagan administration.
   Ortega, on a swing through Western Europe, also told a news
conference that he hoped to improve relations with Washington.
   ``Oliver North has become the scapegoat for the crimes committed
by the government of the United States against Nicaragua,'' Ortega
said.
   ``But who was behind the actions of Oliver North? Who was the
boss of Oliver North? Who promoted the policy followed by Oliver
North? He's called Ronald Reagan. The person who ought to be
standing in the dock is Ronald Reagan, not Oliver North.
   Ortega also said President Bush ``seems clearly to have been
mixed up in these crimes.''
   He said his government had ``hopes and optimism'' that the
United States would change its policies toward Nicaragua.
Washington has maintained an economic embargo against the country
in addition to backing the Contras.
   Ortega is on a 10-nation tour to win economic aid for his
country's battered economy and to enlist Western European help in
persuading the United States to normalize relations with Nicaragua.
   He avoided questions about whether he had received promises of
aid from the countries he has visited thus far: Italy, Greece,
Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Spain and France.
