   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev edged
President Bush in a survey of opinions toward world leaders in
Republican-dominated Orange County, but both ran behind British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Reagan, according to
a poll released today.
   The Los Angeles Times-sponsored survey of Orange County residents
also revealed that 45 percent think the Cold War between the
superpowers is coming to an end.
   The results came in the county that gave Bush and former
President Ronald Reagan their largest margins of victory of any U.S.
county in the presidential elections of 1980, 1984 and 1988.
   Asked, ``Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of these
world leaders,'' positive ratings were as follows: 79 percent for
Mrs. Thatcher, 76 percent for Reagan, 70 percent for Gorbachev, 67
percent for Bush and 21 percent for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   The poll, which involved 600 adults in the county southeast of
Los Angeles, had a 4 percentage point margin of error, the newspaper
said.
   ``The message is that Orange County is more in the mainstream of
American thinking than the perception,'' said longtime Reagan
adviser Stu Spencer. ``Thinking on the Cold War undoubtedly is
changing due to Ronald Reagan's policies.''
   The poll, taken Jan. 13-17 by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of
Irvine, also found that more Orange County residents see Japan and
the Third World as a threat to the United States than the Soviet
Union and China.
   Thirty-one percent said the Third World presented the greatest
threat to the future of the United States. Just 17 percent said the
Soviet Union presents the greatest threat, while 6 percent felt
China was the greatest threat.
   On the issues of abortion, AIDS education and pornography, Orange
County residents again showed a softening of their perceived
conservative tendencies.
   Sixty percent opposed a Supreme Court ban on abortions and 56
percent opposed a ban on the rental of X-rated films at video stores.
   Regarding acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 82 percent favored
teaching youngsters in public schools about the use of condoms as a
means of controlling the spread of the deadly AIDS virus.
