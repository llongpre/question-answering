   Iran told the Security Council today that
the United States committed a ``barbaric crime'' in shooting down
an Iranian airliner and denied U.S. claims that the Navy warned the
jetliner before the attack.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati, in an angry speech,
accused the United States of a premeditated attack on the airliner
with 290 people aboard and demanded the withdrawal of U.S. forces
from the Persian Gulf.
   ``This was the most inhuman military attack in the history of
civil aviation,'' he said.
   He accused the United States of ``arrogance, indifference and a
campaign of lies ... to justify this barbaric crime at any cost...
   ``This was a premeditated act of aggression against the
integrity of Tehran ... a massacre,'' he said.
   Vice President George Bush called the accident a ``terrible
human tragedy'' but told the Security Council that Iran shares the
responsibility.
   ``The critical issue is not the how and why of Iran Air 655,''
Bush said. ``It is the continuing refusal of the government of Iran
to comply with (a U.N. cease-fire resolution), to negotiate an end
to the war with Iraq and to cease its acts of aggression against
neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf.''
   He said Iran ``allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with
passengers to proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle.
That was irresponsible and a tragic error.''
   The meeting was requested by Iran, which sought a condemnation
of the United States. It adjourned after Velayati and Bush spoke
and was scheduled to resume Friday.
   Iran also sought a condemnation of the United States from the
governing council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.
The council agreed today in Montreal that the world body should
investigate the incident, but only four of the 33 members _ China,
the Soviet Union, Cuba and Czechoslovakia _ spoke in favor of U.S
condemnation.
   Diplomats said the 15-member Security Council was not in
agreement on a resolution or statement that would be acceptable to
all parties and would not be vetoed by the United States. As one of
the council's five permanent members, the United States has veto
power.
   Velayati quoted the radio transcript of recordings between
Flight 655 and control towers and said it shows that, contrary to
the U.S. version, the plane never received warnings from the
Vincennes on July 3.
   ``It was traveling in an established civilian air corridor and
transmitting an internationally recognized signal to identify
itself ... Claiming mistaken identity is absurd,'' Velayati said.
   He rebutted U.S. claims that the plane was descending in an
attack mode, that it was transmitting ambiguous civilian and
military signals and that it was outside a recognized air corridor.
   The Navy said the cruiser's crew mistook the A300 Airbus for a
fighter jet and the plane ignored radioed warnings.
   Velayati said the council should compel the United States and
all foreign forces to leave the gulf.``Anything less would be a
further evasion of responsibilitry by the Security Council.''
   The appearance of Bush, a former U.N. ambassador, was considered
a major gesture of hopes for better relations with Iran after
nearly nine years of hostility. A U.S. vice president has not
addressed the council in years.
   Bush was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under former
President Richard Nixon from 1971 to 1973. This is believed to be
his first appearance at the U.N. since. President Reagan has
appeared six times.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied any political
motivation for the appearance by Bush, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee.
   ``The vice president does not normally appear before the
Security Council and in this way we can again highlight our
position,'' Fitzwater said.
   The United States already has expressed deep regret for the
attack and promised compensation to the families of the victims,
but not to the Iranian government.
   The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in
November 1979 after Iranian revolutionaries stormed the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran and took Americans hostage, holding them for more
than a year.
   But both Iran and the United States clearly want to avoid a
bitter public confrontation in the Security Council, and both sides
have been restrained in their statements here and elsewhere.
   The United States has backed off from its call for the council
to impose a mandatory, global arms embargo against Iran.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has said that before the
airliner was shot down, Iranian officials had sent probes about
opening a dialogue with the United States.
   In Tehran, the No. 2 leader, Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, has urged moderation and restraint and opposed violent
retaliation for the U.S. attack. He previously has said Iran must
stop offending the international community, end its isolation and
gain political friends and trading partners.
