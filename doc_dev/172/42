   Lech Walesa faces a runoff in Poland's
presidential contest, but if it were up to the 36,000 Poles who
cast ballots in North America he'd already be in office.
   ``He is the only man for the job,'' St. Louis cab driver
Alexander Gorka said Sunday. ``He can take the country out of the
critical situation it's in.''
   Walesa, the Solidarity leader who led the revolt against four
decades of Communist rule in Poland, got 60 percent of the vote
among Poles in Canada and the United States who voted Saturday,
said Consul Andrezj Jaroszynski in Chicago.
   Citing unofficial figures, he said Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki placed second with 33 percent of the ballots cast by
36,006 voters in North America.
   Upstart emigre businessman Stanislaw Tyminski, who beat
Mazowiecki for second in voting in Poland, had about 3 percent of
the North American vote.
   In Poland, Walesa had just under 40 percent of the vote with 44
of 49 provinces reporting. Tyminski, with 23 percent, made a
surprise showing by beating Mazowiecki, who had 16 percent of the
vote. Three other candidates trailed far behind. Final results were
expected later today.
   A Dec. 9 runoff will be held between the two top vote-getters if
neither wins an outright majority.
   Gorka, who drove from St. Louis to the Polish Consulate in
Chicago to vote, said he cried when he cast his ballot for Walesa,
who had been favored to win.
   ``It was such an important day for me,'' Gorka said. ``It was
the first time in my life I had the freedom to vote in a truly
democratic election in Poland.''
   Turnout was lower than expected in Chicago, where only 9,810 of
more than 40,000 eligible voters went to three polling places,
Jaroszynski said.
   The metropolitan area has a larger bloc of Poles and
Polish-Americans, a total of 800,000 to 1.2 million, than any
municipality outside Warsaw.
   More than 16,000 ballots were cast in New York state, according
to the consulate in New York City.
   Alderman Roman C. Pucinski, a Walesa supporter, said returns in
Chicago, especially in the heavily Polish 41st ward he represents,
show Walesa ``does get his strength from the blue collar workers.''
   In Chicago, Walesa got 76 percent of the vote to Mazowiecki's 18
percent.
   Unofficial North American results showed Walesa with 21,608, or
60 percent; Mazowiecki with 11,823, or 33 percent; Tyminski with
1,238, or 3 percent; and the remainder for the other three
candidates, Jaroszynski said.
   Poland allows naturalized U.S. citizens to hold Polish passports
and vote. Newly arrived immigrants and visitors to the United
States also could vote. Balloting was at sites in North America on
Saturday; voting by mail was not permitted.
