   Foreign investment in the United States is
expected to accelerate dramatically this year, but the true scope
of overseas ownership remains hidden, a congressional critic
complains.
   ``We need to know if foreign ownership is concentrating itself
in key areas of our economy _ energy, steel, banking _ whether
foreign ownership is gaining control of key sectors of the American
economy,'' says Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas.
   Bryant came into the spotlight last year as sponsor of a
provision of the 1,000-page trade bill approved by the House. It
would have forced a major increase in the amount of disclosure
required of foreign investors.
   Lawmakers eventually dropped Bryant's heavily debated plan in an
unsuccessful effort to win President Reagan's approval. And it is
not part of the revised version of the trade bill now under debate.
   But Bryant is still pushing legislation to require foreign
owners to register their major U.S. assets with the Commerce
Department, including business, industrial, real estate and farm
holdings.
   The Reagan administration opposes his bill because ``they don't
want to look like the folks that gave away the store,'' the Dallas
Democrat said.
   Prospects for getting the bill to the president's desk this year
are not especially bright, but Bryant vows not to give up.
   To bolster his case, he cites a private study released last week
showing foreign ownership in the United States more than tripled
since 1980.
   The Congressional Economic Leadership Institute said foreign
investors own about 33 percent of prime commercial real estate in
Washington, D.C., 46 percent in Los Angeles, and 39 percent in
Houston.
   It said they own 10 percent of the U.S. manufacturing base, hold
a majority interest in concrete and consumer electronics
industries, and a significant portion in machine tools, chemicals
and auto parts.
   Nearly 3 million Americans are employed full or part-time as a
result of foreign investment, the study said.
   It acknowledged, however, that foreign investments still account
for no more than 5 percent to 6 percent of U.S. assets.
   Bryant said it is ``foolhardy'' to believe foreign investors
will avoid the United States if they must register their holdings
because ``every other country collects careful data'' without
scaring off business.
   Nancy LeaMond, president of the institute, said: ``In our
innermost circle of trading partners, we are the only nation that
swings the door open unconditionally to virtually every
investment.''
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and former Cabinet
official Elliot Richardson claim Bryant's bill is anti-competitive.
   Richardson testified before the Senate Commerce Committee that
it would discourage foreign investment and result in higher U.S.
interest rates and an economic slowdown.
   Richardson called the reporting requirements burdensome. He said
sufficient data already have been collected by 16 federal agencies
and that investors would have to reveal business secrets.
   In its study, the institute said an ``unprecedented transfer of
American assets to foreign control is under way.''
   Since 1980, foreign direct investment in the United States
expanded by more than 215 percent, while American investment abroad
jumped by one-fifth that rate, the study said.
   Foreign buy-outs are expected to make up as much as 20 percent
of U.S. acquisitions this year, up from 5 percent in 1987, said the
study, which based its findings on the latest available data from
the Commerce Department and other sources.
