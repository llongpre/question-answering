   Iraq today ordered 33-year-old reservists
to report for military duty, its third major call-up of reserves in
recent weeks.
   The ruling Revolutionary Command Council also issued a statement
of defiance on Kuwait, saying it wanted peace but would not cave in
to demands by the United States and its allies.
   The council said it rejected American attempts to impose a date
for a meeting between Saddam Hussein and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III. The two sides have been unable to agree on a date for
Baker to visit Baghdad.
   Baghdad newspapers reported the Ministry of Defense has recalled
men born in 1957 to bolster the mobilization of almost 500,000
soldiers already in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   Saddam said on Nov. 19 he would send 250,000 men - seven new
divisions, apparently drawn from reserve forces, and 150,000
reservists and draftees.
   The move came after President Bush announced U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf would be increased by about 200,000 - to almost
450,000 military personnel in the region - by early January.
   Since then, Iraq has recalled about 60,000 reservist farmers and
an unknown number of others aged 30, 31 and 32.
   Iraq has a force of 500,000 regular soldiers and 480,000
reserves, the sixth largest army in the world. The country of 17
million has about 900,000 men aged 18 to 22 and 1.3 million aged 23
to 32, according to the International Institute for Strategic
Studies.
   The newspaper reports said recruiting offices had informed them
that the 33-year-olds, should report to their units in a week. The
number of affected men was not known.
   Iraq usually recalls its reserves through statements read over
state television and radio. There was no explanation why that
procedure was not followed this time.
   After the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, a U.S.-led multinational
force assembled in the gulf to confront Iraq. A U.N. resolution has
authorized the use of force to liberate Kuwait unless Iraq
withdraws its troops by Jan. 15.
   Iraq had suggested that Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz travel to
Washington today for talks there, and that Baker come to Baghdad on
Jan. 12.
   The United States rejected that date, saying it was too close to
the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N. Security Council for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait or face military action.
   The Revolutionary Command Council, which is headed by Saddam,
issued a statement broadcast over Baghdad radio saying:
   ``We seek peace. We want dialogue for the sake of peace. We
respect legitimacy and seek the application of the international
law on the nation's causes. However, we reject capitulation.''
   It said the Iraqi leaders ``reject the unilateral imposition of
dates as the president of the U.S.A. wishes vis-a-vis the dialogue
to which he agreed.''
   The statement said Iraq was not afraid of the ``fleets and
forces of oppression.''
