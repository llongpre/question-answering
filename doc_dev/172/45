   The rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance handily defeated the governing Christian
Democrats in legislative and municipal elections this week,
election officials announced.
   The defeat presented President Jose Napoleon Duarte, the
staunchest U.S. ally in Central America, with the prospect of an
uphill climb in his final year in office. Presidential elections
are set for March 1989.
   Mario Samayoa, the president of the Central Elections Council,
told journalists ``more than 50 percent'' of the votes cast on
Sunday went to the alliance, known by its Spanish acronym of Arena.
He declined to be more specific, saying complete returns would be
ready shortly.
   The announcement Monday of a majority for Arena signaled a
triumph even greater than the rightists had predicted.
   They had 13 deputies in the outgoing 60-seat National Assembly,
which the centrist Christian Democrats controlled with 33 seats.
   Arena appeared assured of at least 31 seats in the new chamber.
The party predicted it would have 35. Local media projected 33-35
seats for the rightists. The Christian Democrats were expected to
get about 22 seats.
   Voters ignored a leftist guerrilla boycott call and threats of
violence to cast ballots. The guerrillas said the elections were
illegitimate, contending that free and fair elections could not be
held in wartime.
   Washington sent El Salvador almost $600 million in military and
economic aid last year, more than the amount given to any country
in the hemisphere.
   Arena candidate Armado Calderon Sol, a 39-year-old lawyer, won
the mayor's race in San Salvador, the capital and home to 1.5
million of the country's 5 million people. Calderon Sol defeated
Christian Democratic candidate Alejandro Duarte, the president's
son.
   Samayoa said Arena won most of the rest of the country's
municipalities.
   Arena benefited from a groundswell of popular discontent with
the Christian Democrats. Duarte won the presidency in 1984 on a
platform of ending the war and improving the Salvadoran economy.
   The 8-year-old war continues, unemployment is estimated at 40
percent and annual inflation is estimated at nearly 40 percent.
   Arena's campaign slogan was ``Change for the Better.''
   Arena President Alfredo Cristiani, who kept his assembly seat,
told The Associated Press his party would try to reach agreement on
fundamental points with all parties represented in the legislature,
including how to wage the war.
   ``If the guerrillas do not accept the proposal we will make
them, which will be the result of a national consensus, they do not
leave any other way out but a military solution,'' he said.
   He indicated that Arena, which has considerable support and good
connections with military officers, would work to step up
offensives against the rebels.
   ``This low intensity conflict idea should be erased,'' he said,
referring to smaller-scale, U.S.-backed counterinsurgency tactics
that have been adopted by the Salvadoran army.
   In Washington, the State Department hailed El Salvador's
national elections and called them a strong victory for the
democratic process.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who led an observer team named by
President Reagan, called the election honest and important
``because power transferred peacefully'' and ``the rebels didn't
win.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, asked whether the
Reagan administration had any reservations about a rightist
victory, said that ``we don't choose sides in these kinds of
elections.''
   The fiercely nationalistic Arena was formed in 1981, with
retired army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson its founder. D'Aubuisson has
strongly criticized the United States and is considered the driving
force behind early 1980s death-squads.
