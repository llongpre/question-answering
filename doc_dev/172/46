   The Soviet Union's popularity has soared in the
United States since the last superpower summit, and Americans
increasingly support U.S. military cuts to reflect the lessened
tensions, a survey found.
   As President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev prepare
to meet in Washington this week, the national Media
General-Associated Press poll found both leaders continuing to
command great popularity among Americans.
   Gorbachev slipped only slightly from his overall rating in a
similar poll before the last summit in December, even though a
third of the respondents now think less highly of him because of
his crackdown on Lithuania.
   Most striking in the new survey were growing expressions of good
will toward America's old Cold War foe. Forty-one percent of the
respondents said they held favorable views of the Soviet Union,
well up from 24 percent last November and 15 percent in a 1987
survey.
   Fourteen percent of the respondents in the new poll had
unfavorable opinions of the Soviet Union, and 41 percent had a
neutral view.
   In another measure of growing trust, a relatively low 29 percent
believed the Soviets seek to dominate the world. That fear factor
stood at 35 percent last November and 50 percent in a CBS News-New
York Times poll a year ago.
   The new Media General-AP survey was conducted by telephone May
11-20 among a random sample of 1,143 adults across the country. It
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The summit starts Wednesday amid continuing upheaval in the
communist world. Gorbachev is pushing reforms of the Soviet system
while struggling to contain independence movements in some of the
Soviet republics. His Eastern European allies, once viewed as
puppets, largely have abandoned communism.
   Possibly because of Gorbachev's difficulties, the survey found
some sense that the initiative in superpower relations has shifted
to Bush. In November, 41 percent said Gorbachev was doing more than
Bush to reduce tensions, but in the new survey that fell to 33
percent.
   At the same time, those saying Bush was doing more to ease
tensions rose from 29 percent in November to 38 percent now. The
rest were unsure.
   Similarly, 54 percent said Bush was doing enough to encourage
Soviet reforms _ up from 46 percent in November _ and 33 percent
said he was being too cautious, down from 40 percent in November.
Again the rest were unsure.
   In view of the lessened tensions, 50 percent in the new survey
said the United States should reduce its military spending
significantly, up from 41 percent who favored such cuts last
November.
   Additionally, nearly four in 10 said the United States should
immediately begin reducing its forces in Western Europe. While
still a minority, that was up from 25 percent in November.
   The poll found some lingering suspicion of the Soviets. Half
said the Soviet Union cannot be trusted to live up to arms control
agreements _ about the same as in November, but down from 61
percent a year ago.
   On Lithuania, 46 percent said the breakaway Baltic republic
should back off from its claim of independence from the Soviet
Union and hold negotiations, while 31 percent said it should push
its claim. The rest had no opinion.
   But there was support for gradual independence for the Baltic
states. Fifty-seven percent favored the actions of Lithuania and
Latvia, which have claimed independence, while just 8 percent
favored the actions of Estonia, which wants independence but has
not formally claimed it.
   Gorbachev has responded to Lithuania's claim by denying it
shipments of oil and other supplies. While 34 percent said the
embargo has made them think less highly of Gorbachev, 48 percent
said it had not changed their view.
   Overall, 63 percent had a favorable impression of Gorbachev and
69 percent held a favorable view of Bush. As in earlier surveys,
Gorbachev outpolled Bush, 79-68 percent, among the best-educated
respondents, those with postgraduate schooling.
   An overwhelming 75 percent of all respondents approved of the
way Bush is handling relations with the Soviet Union.
