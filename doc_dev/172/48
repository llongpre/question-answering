<LEADPARA>  Nearly one-quarter of Japanese people believe the United States has supplanted
the Soviet Union, long considered Japan's chief nemesis, as the leading threat
to their nation, a newspaper said today.;    Twenty-four percent of
respondents to a survey conducted last month by the mass-circulation Yomiuri
newspaper said the United States has replaced the Soviet Union as the top
threat to Japan, the newspaper reported.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Two years ago, in the last such poll, the Soviet Union was named the top
threat by 33 percent of respondents. Only 11 percent said the United States
topped the list.;    This year, the Soviet Union was cited by 22 percent of
the 3,000 randomly selected respondents as the No. 1 threat.;    Younger
respondents were more wary of the United States than their elders, with 33
percent of those in their 20s citing the United States as the country from
which Japan had the most to fear.;    Twenty-seven percent of respondents in
their 30s cited the United States as the top threat; 24 percent of those in
their 40s and 19 percent of those in their 50s made the same observation.;   
Trade frictions and U.S. discontent with Japan's role in the Persian Gulf war
made the United States more threatening, while the end of the Cold War has
diminished the danger posed by the Soviet Union, the paper quoted unidentified
analysts as saying.;    North Korea, China and South Korea were named as the
next most threatening countries.;    The paper did not say whether the 3,000
"respondents" were the number of people contacted or the number who replied to
questions. Japanese polls usually do not include margins of error because
pollsters believe their inclusion would make the samplings seem more
scientific and accurate than they really are.  </TEXT>
