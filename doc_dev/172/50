   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Elliott Abrams is a man not given to compromise
or mincing his words. That has made him a sizable band of political
enemies, especially in his handling of Central American policy,
where the administration's efforts have not notably prospered.
Undaunted, the assistant secretary for inter-American affairs means
to soldier on until the end of President Reagan's term.

   Elliott Abrams is Ronald Reagan's point man in
the one area where the president's vaunted good luck seems to have
deserted him.
   On no issue have Reagan's policies come under more sustained
assault than in Central America _ Abrams' turf _ but Abrams'
campaigns against cocaine smugglers and what he considers
Cuban-style communism there haven't gotten very far.
   In the process, he has become a lightning rod for policy
opponents' wrath, and he has often found himself the target of
corrosive taunts on Capitol Hill and in the bureaucracy as well.
   Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
looks with pride on the democratic gains made through much of the
hemisphere, but his efforts to dislodge two determined adversaries
_ Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and Nicaragua's Sandinista
government _ seem to have misfired.
   The policies Abrams has pursued are no less controversial than
his style. Although he's only 40, few have seen more intellectual
combat than he has.
   Few neutrals emerge when Abrams is the subject of conversation.
A sampling of opinions: He's arrogant. He's brilliant. He's
untrustworthy. He's courageous. He's unscrupulous. He's principled.
   ``I don't like the man,'' says former Ambassador Frank McNeil,
using a stronger noun.
   ``I wish him a long life,'' says Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   Abrams has never been accused of obsequiousness in dealing with
people who disagree with him.
   ``This is a political battlefield,'' he says. ``The opposition
fights with every weapon available and we need to fight equally
hard.''
   Off duty, the Abrams glower so familiar to opponents disappears,
as does the mantle of the no-apologies crusader.
   Dawn finds him toasting frozen waffles for his three small
children (on weekends he makes French toast from scratch). Late at
night, he can be found curled up with a novel. But, during working
hours, it's the combat zone.
   The combat zone was livelier than usual during the Iran-Contra
hearings last year. It developed that Abrams had earlier misled
Congressional committees about fund solicitations for the Contras
and U.S. involvement in an ill-fated resupply flight for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   From the Democratic camp came predictable cries for Abrams'
resignation. He didn't oblige.
   Some blame him for the administration's more recent policy
setbacks, accusing him of flawed tactics and an abrasive style that
alienates potential allies. His supporters fault Congress as balky
and shortsighted, ``irresolute'' friends in Latin America, hostile
media, bureaucratic infighting and the intractable nature of the
problems he inherited.
   Abrams is a ``neoconservative.'' He worked for two Democratic
senators _ Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and the late Henry
Jackson of Washington state _ and, in the 1980 campaign, for the
election of Ronald Reagan. He is a native of New York City and a
product of Harvard.
   Abram's wife, Rachel, is the daughter of Norman Podhoretz,
editor of Commentary magazine, and Midge Decter, a champion of
conservative causes.
   After defecting to the Republican Party, he joined the
administration in 1981, becoming, at age 33, the youngest person
ever with the rank of assistant secretary of state. He has had that
title as head of three bureaus _ international organizations, human
rights and, since 1985, Latin America.
   American aid to the anti-Sandinista cause has been an article of
faith with Abrams. When Congress last February rejected further
military shipments to the Contras, Abrams thought it would
undermine them in negotiations with their foes _ perhaps fatally.
   The next blow came in May, with the collapse of Abrams'
negotiating efforts to induce Noriega's departure. It was
especially painful since Abrams had seen there a chance to further
democracy in the hemisphere while ridding Panama of a leader who
was under indictment in the United States on drug-dealing charges.
