   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in
the continental United States. Each phone number was selected
randomly by computer, and the interviews was conducted with the
adult who'd had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every
adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within plus or minus three points of the
poll's results, 19 times out of 20.
   The margin of error is higher for subgroups _ 5 points, for
example, for Democrats.
   Other sources of potential error in polls include the wording and
order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this
poll; because of rounding, some may not total exactly 100:
