<HEAD>Latest ABC-Post Poll Gives Dukakis 13-Point Lead Over Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
front-runner, holds a 13-point lead over Republican nominee-to-be
George Bush, according to a poll published today.
   Dukakis leads Bush 53 percent to 40 percent, the survey by The
Washington Post and ABC News indicates.
   The poll also found that the vice president's unfavorability
rating is nearly four times as great as that of Dukakis. Bush is
viewed unfavorably by 37 percent and Dukakis by 10 percent, the
newspaper said.
   The Massachusetts governor is favorably rated by 67 percent of
those surveyed, to 50 percent for the vice president.
   The survey also indicated that the ``gender gap'' plays a part
in Dukakis' lead at this stage. Among women voters, Dukakis holds a
2-1 lead, 61 percent to 33 percent. Bush has the advantage among
male voters, but only of 4 percentage points, the newspaper said.
   The survey of 1,172 randomly selected registered voters
nationwide also suggested, however, that the support of both
candidates is ``soft'' and could easily shift between now and the
November election.
   Dukakis' edge over Bush widened when compared to a similar
Post-ABC poll conducted in March. In that survey, Dukakis had a
5-point lead. Several other polls conducted in recent weeks have
given Dukakis a double-digit lead.
   According to the Post, 57 percent of the Dukakis supporters said
they backed the Massachusetts governor largely because they don't
want Bush to become president. The Post noted that Bush has the
backing of most Reagan supporters, but said that Reagan's
disapproval rating stands at 46 percent.
   On specific issues, the Post-ABC survey indicated that Bush has
a 2-1 edge when the two are compared on the topic of national
defense, and scored a bit better than Dukakis on fighting inflation
and keeping taxes down. But on virtually all other issues, Dukakis
was ahead.
   The Democratic contender was seen as likely to do better at
keeping the United States out of war, helping the poor (by a large
margin), reducing the drug problem, protecting the Social Security
system and keeping unemployment down. Dukakis was also given an
edge in issues like providing leadership, reducing the threat of
nuclear war, bringing down the deficit and maintaining high ethical
and moral standards in his administration.
   The Dukakis camp has played down the recent favorable poll
results. The Bush campaign, however, has reacted to the surveys by
pointing out that the election is months away and the situation
could change dramatically once the two have secured their
respective parties' nominations and are campaigning directly
against one another.
   The telephone interviews for the survey were conducted from May
19 to May 26. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage
points, the newspaper said.
