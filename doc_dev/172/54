   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Jan. 4-12 with 1,162 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3 percentage-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be the within 3 points of the poll's results, 19
times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5
points, for example, among college graduates.
   Other sources of potential error in polls include the wording and
order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of
rounding, sums may not total 100:

talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization, known as the PLO?
