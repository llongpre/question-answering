   Rightists stunned the ruling
Christian Democrats on Monday with a landslide victory in
legislative and municipal elections, weakening President Jose
Napoleon Duarte in his last year in office.
   Voters ignored a leftist guerrilla call to boycott the elections
and threats of violence and turned out in great numbers Sunday to
elect legislators and municipal officials from 262 towns and cities
nationwide.
   Mario Samayoa, president of the Central Elections Council, said
more than 50 percent of the votes cast went to the Republican
Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena.
   The rout included the election of Arena candidate Armando
Calderon Sol, a 39-year-old lawyer, as mayor of San Salvador in a
race against Alejandro Duarte, son of Duarte.
   The defeat in the capital, home to 1.5 million of the country's
5 million people, was especially bitter because the Christian
Democrats had held the post since 1964.
   Final results of the nationwide races were not expected before
Tuesday night.
   The guerrillas rejected the elections as illegitimate,
contending they could not be free and fair in wartime.
   Samayoa said Monday that more than 70 percent of the 1.6 million
registered voters cast ballots.
   ``We knew they (the guerrillas) would not be able to daunt the
people, to intimidate them,'' he said.
   Samayoa's announcement of a majority for Arena meant the triumph
was even greater than the rightists had originally predicted,
increasing their membership in 60-seat National Assembly from 13 to
at least 30.
   Such a tally would guarantee Arena control of the legislature
because two small rightist parties supportive of Arena are assured
of at least one seat apiece.
   Local media projections gave Arena between 33 and 35 seats. The
Christian Democrats entered the race with 33 seats.
   The upset by Arena drastically altered prospects for Duarte, one
of the staunchest U.S. allies in Central America, in his final year
as president. It raised big questions about El Salvador will
proceed in its fight against an 8-year-old guerrilla insurgency and
how it will deal with staggering problems of underdevelopment
aggravated by the conflict.
   Arena, formed in 1981, is fiercely nationalistic. Its founder,
retired army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson, has blasted the United
States and is considered the boss of early 1980s death-squads.
   Former U.S. ambassador to El Salvador Robert White once
described d'Aubuisson _ who retained his legislative seat in
Sunday's vote _ as ``a pathological killer.''
   D'Aubuisson has rejected such charges, as well as the term
``death squads.'' He says citizens were obliged to defend
themselves against leftist ``terrorists.''
   The party's president, Alfredo Cristiani, a coffee-grower and
businessman who was educated at Georgetown University, has been
trying to project an image of moderation for the past two years.
Cristiani also retained his seat in the legislature.
   ``El Salvador needs support and would probably be in difficult
problems if the U.S. would not provide support,'' he told The
Associated Press in an interview Sunday.
   Washington sent El Salvador almost $600 million in military and
economic aid last year, tops in the Western hemisphere.
   In Washington, the State Department hailed El Salvador's
national elections and called them a strong victory for the
democratic process.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, an Indiana Repblican who led an observer
team named by President Reagan, called the election honest and
important ``because power transferred peacefully'' and ``the rebels
didn't win.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman was asked whether the
United States had reservations about the rightist victory.
   ``Our basic policy is that we don't choose sides in these kinds
of elections,'' Redman said.
   Arena benefited from a huge groundswell of popular discontent
with the Christian Democrats. Duarte defeated d'Aubuisson for the
presidency in 1984 on a platform that promised to end the war and
improve the average Salvadoran's lot.
   But the war continues, unemployment is estimated at 40 percent
and inflation is about 40 percent annually.
   Cristiani said Sunday night his party would not present what he
termed ``a systematic and capricious opposition'' to Duarte in the
new assembly.
   ``We are not going to make war on Duarte,'' he added, apparently
trying to dispel speculation that Arena would do everything
possible to make the Christian Democrats' life impossible with an
eye to winning the 1989 presidential election.
   Cristiani said he and his party would try to reach agreement on
fundamental points, including how to wage the war, with all parties
represented in the legislature.
   ``If the guerrillas do not accept the proposal we will make
them, which will be the result of a national consensus, they do not
leave any other way out but a military solution,'' he said.
