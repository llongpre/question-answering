   Worthington (Minn.) Daily Globe on handgun control:
   Another important vote will be coming to the floor of the U.S.
House of Representatives within the next few days.
   The bill is the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which was approved
by the House Judiciary Committee June 30 along with an amendment
that would require a waiting period before anyone can purchase a
handgun.
   The amendment has been officially named the Brady Amendment, for
White House Press Secretary James Brady. ...
   Brady was shot in the head with a handgun that was purchased
over the counter in Texas, one of the many states where nearly
anyone with cash can buy a handgun over the counter. ...
   The Brady Amendment is a logical first step toward limiting the
number of handguns available to convicted felons in the United
States. ...
   We urge Congress to support the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 with
the Brady Amendment attached.

   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on a Soviet-US anti-drug agreement:
   The United States and (the) Soviet Union are negotiating an
agreement to cooperate in the battle against illegal drugs.
   According to David L. Westrate, head of operations for the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration, the agreement for a joint
anti-drug effort by the two superpowers is expected to be signed
this year.
   The United States and (the) Soviet Union should lead the way in
an international war on the world's drug lords.
   Much of the world's wealth spent each year on military arms
could be redirected toward the virtual eradication of illegal drugs
from the face of the earth.
   The U.S.-Soviet effort cannot start too soon.

   The Salina (Kan.) Journal on aid to the Nicaraguan Contras:
   The recent Sandinista crackdown on democratic rights in
Nicaragua was wrong, undeniable wrong.
   There is no debate in the United States about that.
   The suppression of a free press and other crackdowns in
Nicaragua are embarrassing to opponents of Contra aid.
   They are not sufficient reason to renew that aid.

   Los Angeles Daily News on Dukakis-Bush differences:
   It seems likely that (Democratic presidential nominee Michael)
Dukakis may favor the broad use of business-government-labor
``partnerships'' while (Vice President George) Bush may tie himself
tighter to the market-oriented policy of the Reagan years.
   The partnership approach _ which has involved housing, downtown
rehabilitation, mall development and factory retooling _ has been
the Democrats' answer to free enterprise for decades now. ...
   But partnership's track record has been a rather inauspicious
one. Often, it has been a story of taxpayer money used less to
leverage valuable projects and more to line the pockets of
influential developers, political cronies and _ through kickbacks _
corrupt politicians. ...
   It wouldn't surprise us if Bush and Dukakis found themselves in
a lively exchange over partnership, which could prove to be one of
the more philosophical _ and interesting _ debates of their
campaign.

   Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News on ending the Cambodian civil war:
   An Indonesian cocktail party may bring an end to almost two
decades of killing in Cambodia.
   After months of hesitation, the four major factions in the
Cambodian civil war have gathered near Jakarta, using the pretext
of a cocktail party, to begin peace talks. ...
   The four factions are talking ... if only because the three
Cambodian groups are exhausted, and the Vietnamese, who have lost
55,000 troops in the war, realize they can't control their
neighbors.
   The Cambodian civil war has been a war without a winner. All the
participants, including Vietnam and years back the United States,
have been losers.
   Maybe it's all those losses without hope of victory that will
move the combatants to seek peace over cocktails or at the
bargaining table.

   San Antonio (Texas) Express-News on adding a Cabinet position:
   President Reagan promised when he sought the presidency to
abolish the departments of Education and Energy _ a good although
politically impossible idea. ...
   He will probably leave Washington with one more Cabinet position
than when he started. ...
   Looming on the horizon is the Department of Veterans Affairs,
which will emerge full-blown as the second-largest department ...
behind only the Defense Department.
   In its present status as the Veterans Administration, it has ...
an annual budget of about $30 billion. ...
   Veterans are already one of the best-represented, most-respected
groups in Washington with many groups and individuals ready to go
to bat for them. ...
   Supporters claim the conversion will cost only $33 million over
five years. Surely they jest.
   Who ever heard of a Cabinet secretary who didn't try to expand
his domain?
