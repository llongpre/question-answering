   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20.
The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5 points, for example,
for Republicans.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
