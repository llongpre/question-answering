TAX POLICIES RULE OUT A KINDER, GENTLER NATION

Does President Bush realize that, despite the paltry relief provided the poor 
in the 1986 reforms, federal tax policies as they exist today make it all but 
impossible for the United States to be a kinder and gentler nation? 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is now voluminous and conclusive that the wealthiest Americans are 
getting wealthier each year, and the poorest Americans are becoming hopelessly 
poorer. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush says that there will be no significant changes in our tax policies, 
does he mean that he wants this terribly wrong trend to continue? 
</P>
<P>
Recently the House Ways and Means Committee issued a study showing that 
American families on the bottom of the income scale suffered an 11% reduction 
in income adjusted for inflation in the period from 1973 to 1987. Most of that 
drop for the 20% of our lowest-income people occurred in the period from 1979 
to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also found that the top 20% of American families benefited the 
most, with a gain of 24% in purchasing power from 1979 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
This study came on the heels of similar news from the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office, which found that after inflation, most American families in 1988 
had lower incomes than they did in 1977. And the poorest 10% of our population 
gave 20% more of its income to the federal government, while the richest 10% 
paid 0.4% less than in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The most stunning findings of the Congressional Budget Office were as follows: 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1988, 80% of our families had seen their incomes decline since 
1977 when adjusted for inflation. But the richest 10% of Americans saw an 
average increase of 16%. The top 5% averaged a 23% rise and the wealthiest 1% 
saw their incomes grow by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The sobering image that emerges from these statistics is that there has been a 
major new stratification of American society along class lines, despite three 
tax reform efforts in 1978, 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was hailed for removing 6 million working-poor 
people from the income tax rolls as a result of increased personal exemptions. 
And recent legislation establishing the "earned income credit" also was meant 
to give relief to the working poor. But the Congressional Budget Office study 
concludes that these gains were wiped out by higher Social Security taxes and 
by higher taxes on alcohol, tobacco and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
We also should not forget that tax-reform concessions to the working poor do 
not justify a tax policy that extracts a higher price from our most vulnerable 
people when we spend less for housing, education and health care in our 
attempts to deal with the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The clear reason for this drastic shift in income distribution was an attitude 
shared by the Reagan-Bush Administrations and Congress. That attitude holds 
that progressivity, for many years a valid idea that proposes that those who 
can afford it should pay more to sustain the whole of America, has now become a 
dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
Where can we begin to stop the economic punishment of the working poor and once 
again proclaim the social contract that made America a sign of hope for the 
poor and oppressed of the world? 
</P>
<P>
We can start with that absurd 28% top rate. 
</P>
<P>
When Ronald Reagan came to Washington in 1981, his first major proposal was for 
an across-the-board 25% tax reduction for every American. The maximum rate 
would drop from 70% to 50%. That sounded good to tax-weary American workers. 
</P>
<P>
The President sold that across-the-board idea wherever he traveled, and people 
bought it without realizing that 25% of $1 million is an awful lot of money 
compared to 25% of $1,000, especially when the poor and middle class had to 
give their windfall back in the form of higher Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
That was the first torpedo fired at progressivity, and the Congress saw nothing 
wrong with it. 
</P>
<P>
After Reagan won reelection in a landslide in 1984, it was only a matter of 
days before Treasury Secretary Donald Regan unveiled another tax-revision plan. 
This time the maximum rate would drop precipitously once more, from 50% to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Congress struggled fitfully with the new proposal, and in return for the 
elimination of some egregious shelters and loopholes, a House-Senate conference 
committee brought forth an astonishing two-tier rate that saw the middle class 
paying 33% maximum and the richest people in America paying only 28%. 
</P>
<P>
What a coup for the most affluent people in the United States. Think of it. 
Donald and Ivana Trump pay their taxes at a lower rate than John and Margaret 
Suburbanite. 
</P>
<P>
The poor in America are sinking, Mr. President. Nevertheless, they still try 
mightily to improve their condition. But our poorest people need more help. 
They need a more compassionate and fairer government, and they need your help 
to give it to them.
