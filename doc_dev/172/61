   Former President Ronald Reagan on Wednesday urged
Japan to leave a great legacy of its ``golden age'' to history by
helping Poland and other communist countries achieve freedom and
democracy.
   ``This is a golden age for Japan,'' Reagan told some 600 people
attending a banquet in his honor. ``A genuine golden age provides
the world with a distinctive idea, a philosophy, a cause, a greater
good.
   ``So what will be Japan's legacy?'' he asked.
   Reagan called on Japan to join the United States in promoting
freedom and democracy, particularly in communist countries moving
toward democracy.
   ``Great endeavors make great nations. Let Japan undertake this
great endeavor to help save Poland, Hungary and Eastern Europe. I
know you will,'' he said.
   In a television interview earlier in the day, the 78-year-old
former president said the United States and Japan are good friends
who have made significant progress in their sometimes rocky trade
relations.
   ``There are just a few little itchy things here and there that
we still are working on from both sides, and part of our problem is
our own Congress that we have to bring into line,'' Reagan said.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States last year totaled
$52 billion, according to U.S. figures.
   Reagan said he believes Sony Corp.'s recent purchase of Columbia
Pictures for $3.4 billion was welcome in the United States.
   ``I just have the feeling that maybe Hollywood needs some
outsiders to bring back decency and good taste to some of the
pictures that are being made,'' the former movie star said.
   The interview was with the Fuji Television network, owned by the
Fujisankei Communications Group, Japan's largest media conglomerate
and Reagan's host during his nine-day, $7 million visit. Company
officials said the banquet was intended to raise funds for Reagan's
presidential library.
   Reagan received a standing ovation and a warm toast from former
Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, who said Reagan would be ``remembered
forever in the annals of world history'' for his contributions to
peace and democracy.
   Many of Fujisankei's dozens of media organizations espouse
conservatism and nationalism. At Wednesday evening's dinner,
Fujisankei Co-chairman Hiroaki Shikanai said his company was
determined to ``do our best to serve as a communication medium
between the Japan and the United States.''
   Fujisankei officials have refused comment on reports the Reagans
are being paid $2 million for their visit.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, also are visiting as guests of the
Japanese government, which Monday awarded him one of its highest
honors for promoting free trade and friendship between the two
countries.
