   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had
the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within plus or minus three points of the
poll's results, 19 times out of 20.
   The margin of error is higher for subgroups _ seven points, for
example, for respondents earning $50,000 or more a year.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals are not
exactly 100:
