   Riot police used tear gas today to
disperse about 600 teachers demanding their salaries and yelling
``Noriega must go.''
   Strikes and disturbances broke out when some workers demanded
cash instead of the bags of food the government today began
distributing to public employees until it has the money for
salaries.
   For the first time, the disturbances reached into the central
business district.
   Police, armed with rubber truncheons and tear gas grenades,
forcibly removed the teachers, who were blocking traffic in front
of the Ministry of Education. The teachers shouted, `We want out
pay,'' ``Books yes, arms no,'' and ``Justice.''
   The nation's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
its new civilian chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma, and other top
government officials ended an emergency meeting at 2 a.m. today.
There was no immediate comment on what action, if any, they took to
overcome U.S. economic sanctions aimed at bringing down the
military regime.
   The government has said it does not have enough money to meet
this week's public payroll of $33 million for its 130,000 public
employees.
   Horacio Rodriguez, director of the Ministry of Farm and Dairy
Products Marketing, said his agency had prepared 12,000 of the bags
of food for distribution this week.
   They contained basic staples of the Panamanian diet such as
rice, beans, flour, potatoes, fresh vegetables and beef.
   The ``dignity bags'' were being sold by the government for
between $15 and $16 each. It was believed that officials were not
demanding cash, and it was not clear how the workers were paying
for the supplies.
   In another development, men in civilian clothes fired guns
outside a church service in Panama City on Sunday and attacked a TV
cameraman after roughing up a woman who was selling an
anti-government newsletter. No one was injured.
   The attack came at the Roman Catholic Church of Christ the King,
long a center of government opposition activity, as its pastor, the
Rev. Xavier Villanueva, was beginning a late-morning Mass.
   Solis Palma, installed by the ruling military last month as
minister in charge of the presidency, has been meeting with his
chief advisors almost constantly since last Thursday. Sunday's
meeting was the first time that Noriega had been known to join them.
   Meanwhile, Noriega was said by a chief aide to be ``in excellent
spirits, working very hard, always on the phone and maintaining his
determination not to surrender.''
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, the general's press officer, said Noriega
was telephoning other countries in search of financial assistance
and received ``some very positive answers from some friendly
governments.''
   Lopez declined to elaborate, but he added, ``this is a very
complex situation that cannot be solved in 72 hours.''
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on federal drug
trafficking and money laundering charges.
   Almost one in every five workers in this nation of 2.5 million
people is employed by the government. While Noriega's popularity
has fallen recently, he has so far enjoyed at least the outward
support of government employees.
   In Washington, administration officials acknowledged Sunday that
the economic sanctions imposed by President Reagan on Friday were
intended to make it harder for the Panamanian government to pay the
public employees.
   The timing of the sanctions ``was not a coincidence,'' said one
administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Reagan ordered the withholding of $6.5 million in monthly Panama
Canal fees due Panama this week and eliminated a trade preference
the country has enjoyed under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
   Earlier, the United States suspended all economic and military
aid to Panama and suppported legal efforts to freeze an estimated
$50 million in official Panamanian funds held in American banks.
   The legal action was taken by attorneys for Eric Arturo
Delvalle, who was deposed as Panama's president on Feb. 26 in a
coup engineered by Noriega. Although Delvalle has been in hiding
ever since, he still is recognized by the United States as Panama's
legitimate president.
   The government ordered Panama's 118 local and foreign banks
closed temporarily on March 3, saying it could not provide them
with enough money to cover withdrawals. There was no word Sunday of
when the banks would reopen.
   Their closure has left the country in economic chaos, with
businessmen and individuals unable to cash checks and hoarding
precious dollars, which Panama uses as its currency.
   In the attack outside the church on Sunday, an Associated Press
reporter and photographer said between 8 and 10 men dressed in
civilian clothes fired handguns in the air and smashed the windows
of automobiles parked outside the Church of Christ the King.
   No one was hurt in the shooting, but two of the gunmen struck an
Italian television cameraman and stole his video camera as he was
filming the incident. The men threw rocks at other reporters on the
scene.
