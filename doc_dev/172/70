   The race for the Nicaraguan presidency is a dead
heat, according to a poll by a Miami TV station, with support
nearly even for Sandinista President Daniel Ortega and U.S.-backed
candidate Violeta Chamorro.
   Univision News' pollster suggested that a position by the Roman
Catholic church, which has suffered years of harassment from the
Sandinistas, could tip the election.
   In the poll, which was taken at the end of October, Ortega
received 40 percent and Chamorro 39 percent.
   Eight other candidates got a total of 5 percent, and 16 percent
of the sample of 1,129 voters said it was undecided. The poll had a
margin of plus or minus 3 percent.
   The poll is the first independently sponsored poll among voters
registered for the Feb. 25 election that challenges the rule of the
Marxist-leaning Sandinistas who have held power since toppling
dictator Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
   Ortega, elected in 1984, seeks another five-year term. Mrs.
Chamorro's United Nicaraguan Opposition, or UNO, is a coalition of
12 of Nicaragua's 21 registered parties.
   Sergio Bendixen, of Bendixen and Schroth Polls, which did the
survey, noted that only 25 percent of those polled consider the
United States a friend whereas the Soviet Union and Cuba received
respective friendship rankings of 66 percent and 70 percent.
   The U.S. government-backed Contra fighters seeking to topple the
Sandinistas also got across-the-board low ratings.
   He said the numbers tended to hold up even among those who
oppose the Sandinistas.
   The poll said Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo, the head of
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic Church, had a ``favorable'' rating of 67
percent and that among the undecided voters it was nearer 80
percent.
   ``That 16 percent may look to the Cardinal for an indirect
signal if he decides to sent one,'' Bendixen said.
   The company has done pre-election polls in eight other countries
since 1984 and never missed by more than 3 percent except where
there were widespread allegations of irregularities.
   Overall, 57 percent of those polled gave positive marks to the
Sandinistas for what they have done since 1979 and 39 percent had a
negative opinion.
   Among other things, the poll showed:
   _ That 58 percent of those polled think Nicaragua's elections
will be honest and 27 percent predict fraud.
   _ Sixty-one percent say life was better before the Sandinista
Revolution and only 24 said it had improved since.
   _ Forty-four percent think the Sandinistas will give up power if
they lose and 41 percent think they will not.
   _ Generally speaking, 56 percent think things are going badly in
Nicaragua and 41 percent think things are going well.
   _ Thirty-six percent think the Sandinistas are responsible for
Nicaragua becoming one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere;
Thirty-three percent blamed the United States and the Contra war
and 19 percent said both were to blame. Fifty-seven percent blame
the United States for problems in general.
   _ Fifty-eight percent said the opposition parties are free to
campaign and 33 percent said the government is harassing the
opposition.
   _ American assistance of $9 million to the Supreme Electoral
Council and the Nicaraguan opposition has approval from 56 percent
and disapproval from 35 percent. Such aid is legal in Nicaragua if
not given covertly.
