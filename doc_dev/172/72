   This Associated Press poll was conducted by
telephone Aug. 8-12 among a random sample of 1,004 adults in the
continental United States. Interviewing was done by ICR Survey
Research Group of Media, Pa.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that 19
of 20 times its findings should be within three points of the
result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The
error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Do you support or oppose sending U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia
to help defend it against a possible Iraqi attack? Support: 64
percent. Oppose: 22 percent. Don't know or no answer: 14 percent.
   2. How likely do you think the United States is to become
involved in a war with Iraq _ do you think this is very likely,
somewhat likely, not too likely or not likely at all? Very: 33.
Somewhat: 39. Not too: 17. Not at all: 6. DK-NA: 6.
   3. An international economic embargo of Iraq has begun. Do you
think the economic embargo will succeed in forcing Iraq out of
Kuwait, or not? Yes: 33. No: 43. Maybe: 7. DK-NA: 18.
   4. Do you think the United States should bomb Iraqi military
targets to force Iraq out of Kuwait, or not? Yes: 27. No: 59.
DK-NA: 13.
   5. Do you think the United States should use U.S. ground troops
to try to push Iraq out of Kuwait, or not? Yes: 35. No: 52. DK-NA:
13.
   6. Do you think the recent increases in gasoline prices in the
United States are a legitimate result of Iraq's attack on Kuwait,
or do you think the oil companies are taking advantage of the
situation and raising prices unfairly? Legitimate: 6. Unfair: 86.
Partly both: 3. DK-NA: 5.
   7. Do you think the situation in the Middle East is likely to
create oil shortages in the next few months, with rising prices and
long lines at the service stations, or don't you think that's
likely? Likely: 52. Not likely: 42. DK-NA: 7.
