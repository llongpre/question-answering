   President Reagan says the United States
considers its confrontation with Iran in the Persian Gulf
``closed'' following attacks that left two Iranian oil platforms
destroyed and Iran's Navy heavily damaged.
   ``It seems to be quieting down and we hope it continues that
way,'' Reagan said Tuesday.
   Reagan also said he was not surprised by Iran's decision to
fight back Monday after U.S. forces destroyed the platforms in
retaliation for the mining that damaged a Navy ship last week.
   The U.S. Navy later sunk or damaged six Iranian warships in the
daylong warfare.
   The president commented on the gulf during a picture-taking
session at the start of a meeting with Republican members of
Congress.
   Later, in a written report to Congress, Reagan said ``no doubt
exists'' that Iran was responsible for planting the mines that
prompted the U.S. strike.
   ``We have completed these self-defense actions and consider the
matter closed,'' Reagan wrote. He said U.S. forces must remain in
the area, and ``our forces remain prepared to take any additional
action necessary to protect themselves, U.S.-flag vessels and U.S.
lives.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz echoed Reagan's comments,
saying U.S. ships were in the gulf ``in a non-confrontational way''
and did not want ``to be engaged in a confrontation with Iran.''
   He denied Iran's assertion that the U.S. attacks were planned in
concert with Iraqi attacks on the Faw peninsula.
   ``We and others have a right to unimpeded access to the
international waterways, and we protect that right,'' Shultz told
reporters on his flight from Washington for three days of talks in
Moscow.
   Meanwhile, U.S. ships and helicopters continued searching today
for a Marine helicopter missing since Monday's violence in the
gulf, a Pentagon spokesman said. Iran has claimed that it downed a
helicopter, although the U.S. still lists the craft as missing.
   ``We don't have any indication of the status of the helicopter
or the people on board,'' said Maj. William O'Connell.
   The Pentagon identified the missing crewmen as Capt. Stephen C.
Leslie, 30, and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, 33, assigned to Squadron
HMLA-167 based at the New River, N.C., Marine Corps Air Station.
   Reagan said nine ships were taking part in a search-and-rescue
mission for the helicopter.
   The Pentagon said there was no evidence the helicopter was shot
down and reported no U.S. casualties were reported in the warfare
Monday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Adm. William Crowe,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Reagan and GOP leaders
Tuesday that Iranian ships were essentially staying in port a day
after suffering heavy losses.
   Crowe also said there was no evidence Iran had fired Silkworm
missiles, as had been reported earlier.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the Pentagon had no estimate
of Iranian casualties in the fighting, nor had U.S. ships picked up
any survivors.
   Howard also repeatedly and flatly denied press reports that the
United States was temporarily suspending its escort operations for
reflagged Kuwaiti tankers until the gulf calmed down again.
   Sources close to the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. said the Navy was
halting until further notice escorts of the 11 tankers it reflagged
nine months ago. They said the main channel where the American
frigate Samuel B. Roberts was hit must be swept before the convoys
resume.
   Howard declared Tuesday, ``When we get ready to do a convoy,
we'll do it,'' saying reports of a suspension are ``simply not
true.''
   The spokesman confirmed that U.S. and allied mine-sweepers were
continuing to find underwater explosives in the southern gulf
almost a week after the Roberts struck one on April 14.
   At his White House meeting, Reagan won support from the
Republican lawmakers for his refusal to invoke the War Powers Act,
which the administration claims is unconstitutional.
   The 1973 law requires the president to notify Congress within 48
hours after American forces are put into a situation in which they
may become engaged in hostilities. It also requires those forces to
be withdrawn within 60 days, subject to a 30-day extension, if
Congress fails to declare war.
