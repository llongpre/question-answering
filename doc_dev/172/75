   A Japanese official said Saturday he hopes
President Reagan will veto a bill approved by the U.S. Senate to
curb textile imports to the United States.
   ``It is regrettable that the U.S. Senate approved the bill,
ignoring the fact that U.S. textile exports have increased and the
industry did not perform as badly as many people believed,'' said
Chang Chang-han, acting secretary general of the Taiwan Textile
Federation.
   The Senate, by a 57-32 vote, Friday approved new curbs on
textile, clothing and shoe imports. The bill still needs approval
by the House of Representatives before it can be sent to President
Ronald Reagan.
   The bill would freeze this year's imports of textiles, apparel
and non-rubber footwear at 1987 levels and limit their growth to 1
percent annually thereafter.
   ``We hope President Reagan will veto the bill if it is passed by
the House,'' Chang said. ``Such a protectionist measure will only
hurt American consumers who would have to pay higher prices for
textile products.''
   The United States has been Taiwan's largest market for textile
goods. Last year, Taiwan's apparel and textile exports to the
United States totaled $3.2 billion, up 14 percent from 1986.
   During a meeting in Tokyo Saturday with visiting U.S. Commerce
Secretary C. William Verity, the Japanese minister of international
trade and industry, Hajime Tamura, expressed hope that the bill
would be vetoed by Reagan ``because of its protectionist nature,''
a ministry official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Japanese government had issued no formal reaction to the bill,
however.
   In Hong Kong, a leading trade official said the bill was
unnecessary and unlikely to survive a presidential veto.
   ``The bill is totally unnecessary and inappropriate ... because
the U.S. textile industry has been doing well,'' said Miranda Chiu,
acting assistant director of trade for the export-fueled British
colony.
   ``Any protectionist measure would definitely have adverse
effects on exporting countries (such as) Hong Kong,'' Chiu said.
She said it would be difficult to gauge the precise impact on the
colony because the bill does not provide details on how it would be
implemented.
   Exports from Hong Kong of apparel and clothing accessories to
the United States reached $3.4 billion in 1986, up 9 percent from
the previous year, according to the Census and Statistics
Department.
   Exports of textile fabrics to the United States totaled $116
million in 1986, up 11 percent from 1985, it said.
