   Behind the fanfare surrounding the visit of former
President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, there is a clear
message: Tokyo values harmonious ties with the United States and
sees Reagan as the catalyst.
   The Reagans' hosts, the huge Fujisankei Communications Group and
the Japanese government, showered their guests with lavish praise
during their nine-day, $7 million visit, which ends Saturday.
Fujisankei reportedly paid Reagan $2 million.
   Reagan, in turn, glossed over serious trade disputes in his
speeches with expressions of affection for the Japanese people.
   However, in a speech scheduled to be delivered at the end of his
visit, Reagan said Americans did not think their products had fair
access to Japan and that trade barriers must be lowered to avoid
rising anger in the United States.
   ``As a friend, I tell you that Americans are not as patient as
the Japanese,'' Reagan said in his speech, according to the New
York Times.
   Officials here have welcomed the opportunity to emphasize
positive aspects of sometimes rocky U.S.-Japanese ties.
   ``President Reagan symbolizes U.S.-Japan friendship,'' said
Yukio Okamoto, director of the Foreign Ministry's North American
Division.
   As Emperor Akihito looked on, the government showed its
appreciation for Reagan's role in promoting good ties with Japan
and in fighting trade protectionism in office by awarding him one
of its highest honors, the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the
Chrysanthemum.
   The only other U.S. president to receive the award was Dwight
Eisenhower.
   Mrs. Reagan has been honored during the visit for her anti-drug
program and for her support for her husband.
   Reagan, 78, is the only former U.S. president to receive such
regal treatment, officials said, because unlike his predecessors
who either left office in disgrace or after losing elections,
Reagan served the two full terms and left office as a popular
leader.
   ``There is nothing controversial about inviting Reagan.
President Reagan still carries high prestige among the American
people,'' Okamoto said.
   The Reagans enjoy enormous prestige in Japan. Reagan's dignified
demeanor, coupled with the image of the two former movie stars
standing hand-in-hand, captures romantic imaginations in a country
that revels in the pomp of lavish wedding ceremonies and royalty.
   At concerts, banquets and other gatherings of Japan's rich and
powerful, the Reagans have received trumpet fanfares, standing
ovations and warm smiles. ``You'll never know, Ron, how much we
need you. Please come here with Nancy to stay,'' audience and
performers sang to the tune of ``You Are My Sunshine'' on Sunday at
a concert to benefit the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
   A capacity crowd of 56,000 cheered as Reagan tossed the
ceremonial first pitch in a Japanese championship baseball game
Tuesday.
   Rather than criticizing Tokyo for trade barriers, which
Washington says contributed to Japan's $52 billion trade surplus
with the United States last year, Reagan spoke of a ``golden age
for Japan'' in his speeches.
   Trade issues, he said, were ``a few little itchy things here and
there that we still need working on from both sides.''
   Americans, as the world's largest foreign investors, should
welcome Japanese investments in the United States, Reagan said. He
said Sony Corp.'s takeover of Columbia Pictures could help ``bring
back decency and good taste to some of the pictures that are being
made.''
   A Newsweek survey following the takeover indicated that
Americans view Japan's economic power as a greater threat than
Soviet military might.
   While Reagan has occasionally reminded listeners here that
having retired, he no longer speaks for the U.S. government,
officials of the Japanese government have welcomed his words of
praise, his optimism and his playing down of economic disputes.
   ``We need a communicator of Reagan's prestige and ability,''
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe. ``We respect him
and we love him.''
   Reagan's conservative, pro-business ideology and his opposition
to protectionist trade policies have enormous appeal in Japan,
particularly with the couple's host, the Fujisankei Group, which is
known for the conservative, nationalist outlook of its chairman,
Nobutaka Shikanai, and of its media outlets.
   A Fujisankei official said Shikanai wanted to ``bring Reagan in
and give him a chance to talk to the Japanese people,'' in hopes
the visit would smooth over some problem areas.
