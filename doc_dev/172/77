   Jose Castillo hacked the husk off a
coconut with an axe and glanced at the skewed remants of his home.
   ``I'm just thinking,'' he said, tipping back his baseball cap.
``I can't just march in there and take my things out. The rest of
it (the house) will come down on my head.''
   Castillo was one of tens of thousands of Atlantic coastal
residents left homeless after Hurricane Joan crashed into Nicaragua
before dawn Saturday. Preliminary figures put casualties from the
hurricane's 24-hour rampage across Nicaragua at 50 people dead and
300,000 homeless.
   On Monday, residents of Bluefields, 180 miles east of the
capital of Managua, began rebuilding their lives. Bluefields has a
population of 38,000 and the storm killed 21 people in the area.
   Some residents picked through rubble seeking prized possessions
or building material.
   The cobblestone streets were littered with piles of wood and
rusted metal. Some women gathered to obtain government-provided
rice, beans, milk and cooking oil.
   ``The soap is already gone,'' said Argentina Casco de Gutierez
as she carried provisions back to what was left of her wooden-plank
home.
   The hurricane winds of more than 125 mph destroyed the wooden
homes, many that dated back to the last century when the so-called
Miskito Coast belonged to Great Britain. A few structures made of
concrete withstood the storm.
   The view from a helicopter of the city showed virtually no roof
unscathed. Most were torn off completely.
   The city's only hospital suffered severe damage but was open
Monday. An official, Reynaldo Aguilar, said 150 Bluefields
residents suffered injuries, mostly shock.
   Pedro Senteno Vale became a father of nine on Sunday when his
wife gave birth to a daughter the day after the hurricane struck.
   ``She doesn't have a name,'' he said of the infant. ``I'm going
to call her Joan.''
   Thousands of people remained in government shelters.
   Many coastal residents waited until shortly before the full
force of the hurricane struck before going to the shelters.
   ``We all held hands so we wouldn't be blown away,'' Castillo
said.
   Aster Gerth, 33, sat on the curb across from the Roman Catholic
Church, a shelter where he and about 800 other people are staying.
He said many of the victims feared looting.
   ``They come at night to go through the things,'' he said of
thieves and then added: ``I'm going to rebuild my home one way or
another. But we need help.''
   Gerth, a fisherman, asked a reporter: ``Do you think the United
States will help? The Russians and the Cubans can't do what the
United States can.''
   President Daniel Ortega, who visited Bluefields Monday, said his
government would accept aid from the United States if it comes
``without conditions.''
   But in Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Ortega was using the tragedy of the storm as propaganda against the
Reagan administration's support of Nicaraguan rebels who have been
fighting the leftist government for seven years.
   He said no request for U.S. aid had been received from the
Nicaraguan government and none was expected.
