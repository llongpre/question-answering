   President Guillermo Endara on
Thursday appealed to the United States and other countries for help
in rebuilding the economy, where he said a third of the work force
is unemployed.
   ``But the most important ingredient,'' Endara told nearly 400
business leaders and members of the Civic Crusade, ``will be our
own work and the adjustments needed to make out economy competitive
again.''
   The organization is an umbrella group for opponents of ousted
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Also Thursday, Endara said he has a 24-year-old girlfriend but
has no plans to marry soon.
   ``We are getting to know each other,'' Endara, who is 54, told
reporters.
   Endara, whose wife, Marcela Cambra, died shortly after the May
elections, appeared in public Monday with girlfriend Ana Mai Diaz
for the first time and journalists saw them holding hands.
   ``I am going out with her but I have not yet thought of getting
married,'' he said.
   Government sources said Endara will travel Sunday to San Jose,
Costa Rica, to meet with President Oscar Arias and would make an
official visit to Washington late this month.
   Endara said unemployment is the most pressing problem facing the
government. Without giving any figures, he said 33 percent of the
labor force was unemployed.
   The Panamanian president said he had written to President Bush
outlining Panama's economic needs.
   ``The U.S. assistance is important to complement our own
economic efforts and to strengthen democracy and freedom and to
make sure that the sacrifices of Panamanians and Americans were not
in vain,'' he added referring to the dead during the U.S. invasion
that was launched Dec. 20.
   The U.S. action ousted Noriega, who awaits trial in Florida on
drug charges, and resulted in Endara taking office. Endara was
leading by a 3-1 margin in last year's presidential elections when
Noriega canceled the vote count.
   Endara asked for ``the generous and timely help of the United
States and other friendly countries'' to help rebuild Panama's
economy. Officials say Panama sustained more than $2 billion damage
from the invasion.
   A Panamanian commission is in the United States meeting with
U.S. officials to speed up the flow of economic assistance to
Panama. The United States has expressed a willingness to help
Panama but declined to give figures on how much aid money will be
forthcoming.
   The U.S. government froze more than $400 million in Panamanian
government assets during Noriega's last 20 months in power. The
United States has released nearly $100 million in frozen funds.
