   The United States lands in the middle of the pack
in rankings of life expectancy and death rates in 33 developed
nations, according to new figures from U.S. health officials.
   Atop the list: Japan.
   In the United States, the average life expectancy is 75 years,
trailing Japan by 4.1 years, but beating the lowest of the 33,
Hungary, by more than five years, the national Centers for Disease
Control reported Thursday.
   The average Hungarian lives 69.7 years, the CDC said.
   The United States also ranked near the middle of the 33 nations
in death rates from all causes: 828.4 deaths are reported for each
100,000 people each year. Japan was best at 628.8; Romania worst at
1,242.
   The leading cause of death in the United States, heart disease,
hits harder here than in other countries. The U.S. mortality rate
from heart disease was 382 per 100,000 per year for men and 214 for
women, compared with 339 and 206 in the other 32 developed
countries.
   Throughout the 33 countries, heart disease accounted for 30
percent of deaths, with cancer causing 21 percent and stroke
causing 14 percent.
   Fourteen percent of deaths in the 33 countries _ about 1.5
million a year _ are attributed to smoking, the CDC said.
   Fewer Americans smoke, compared with the other countries; 31
percent of U.S. males and 26 percent of American females smoke,
compared with 41 percent of men and 29 percent of women in the
other countries.
   ``The large number of deaths attributable to cigarette smoking
indicates that reduction of this risk factor would substantially
increase life expectancy in the developed world,'' the
Atlanta-based CDC said.
   The CDC study included countries defined as developed according
to a 1963 U.N. standard pegged to reproductive rates: countries
where the average woman has fewer than two daughters who,
themselves, survive their childbearing years.
   Such areas include the United States and Canada, the Soviet
Union, most of Europe, some Latin American nations, Japan and
Australia.
   The CDC study cited life expectancies and death rates in the
latest available statistics for each country, from 1984 to 1987.
   Life expectancies for the 33 countries: Australia 76.3 years,
Austria 75.1, Belgium 74.3, Bulgaria 71.5, Canada 76.5,
Czechoslovakia 71.0, Denmark 74.9, East Germany 73.2, Finland 74.8,
France 75.9, Greece 76.5, Hungary 69.7, Iceland 77.4, Ireland 73.5,
Israel 75.2, Italy 75.5, Japan 79.1, Luxembourg 74.1, Malta 74.8,
Netherlands 76.5, New Zealand 74.2, Norway 76.3, Poland 71.0,
Portugal 74.1, Romania 69.9, Spain 76.6, Sweden 77.1, Switzerland
77.6, United Kingdom 75.3, United States 75.0, U.S.S.R. 69.8, West
Germany 75.8, Yugoslavia 71.0.
