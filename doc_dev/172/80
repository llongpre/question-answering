   Jonas Savimbi, the Angolan rebel leader,
said Monday the civil war may end this year because of superpower
pressure and his country's weariness with bloodshed.
   ``The pressure for peace from inside and outside Angola will be
so great, I don't see how either side will be able to continue
fighting in 1990,'' said Savimbi, who has U.S. support. ``We are
going to launch an enormous effort to end the war this year.''
   He spoke to reporters during a tour of Europe that also will
take him to Belgium, Switzerland, West Germany and possibly France,
in search of support for his UNITA guerrilla movement.
   Savimbi has fought the Soviet-backed government since Angola
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   He said UNITA, whose formal name is the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, had been in direct contact with Cuba
to give assurances the rebels would not attack Cuban soldiers
stationed in Angola.
   Last week, Cuba suspended the withdrawal of its troops after
four Cubans where killed in a UNITA raid.
   Reports on Monday from Luanda, the Angolan capital, said Cuban
soldiers killed 33 guerrillas in apparent reprisal for the Jan. 21
rebel attack.
   Cuban soldiers had not been involved in fighting since the
withdrawal began after South Africa pledged in December 1988 to
stop aid to UNITA and grant independence to neighboring Namibia.
Cuba originally had 50,000 soldiers in Angola and an estimated
19,000 remain.
   Savimbi said better superpower relations meant the Kremlin would
support a more active role for the United States in seeking peace.
U.S. envoy Herman Cohen was in London on Monday and reports said he
intended to meet with Soviet officials about Angola.
   A cease-fire signed in June at Gbadolite, Zaire, collapsed
within days. Since December, UNITA has fought off what the rebels
describe as the largest government offensive ever launched against
their strongholds.
   Halting that offensive and arranging talks between Savimbi and
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos should be the next steps, the
rebel leader said.
   ``The Americans and the Portuguese can play a more active role
in the search for peace by establishing where the common ground
between the two sides lies and using that to bring us together,''
he said.
   Savimbi said the United States and Portugal should support peace
efforts by President Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire, who has mediated
between the government and rebels. He said Portugal could serve as
a channel of communication between the sides.
   President Mario Soares and Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva of
Portugal met with Savimbi separately over the weekend. Jose Durao
Barroso, secretary of state for foreign affairs, flew to London on
Monday for talks with Cohen.
   Savimbi met with Roman Catholic Church leaders and labor union
officials Monday.
