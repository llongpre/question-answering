   Jordan's King Hussein said Saturday that
President George Bush probably understands the Middle East better
than Ronald Reagan and would be more likely to personally engage in
the search for peace in the region.
   Hussein also said he hoped the United States would not let too
much time elapse before getting involved in the stalled peace
process, because the ``situation is very, very volatile.'' He spoke
in a television interview on Cable News Network.
   Hussein, who met with President George Bush in Tokyo on Friday,
said he hoped the Middle East problem would get the ``attention that
it deserves'' by the new Bush administration.
   ``The difference, I would say, is that President Reagan probably
had other priorities, and I don't think he was personally engaged in
the Middle East problem or with any of the attempts to resolve the
problem there,'' Hussein said.
   Reagan offered his own 1982 peace proposal for the region, which
called for a Palestinian state to be confederated with Jordan, but
was turned down by Israel and the Arabs.
   Reagan's Secretary of State, George Shultz, traveled to the
region numerous times but was unable to bring the sides to the
negotiating table.
   ``I have a feeling that President Bush knows the area and knows
how volatile and how dangerous it is,'' Hussein said.
   The urgency arises from the violent 14-month Palestinian uprising
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which has resulted in more than
300 Arab deaths. He also wants the United States to move faster on
its recently begun dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization and to include the group in peace talks.
   Bush said at a Tokyo news conference on Saturday that recent
developments in the Middle East had created opportunities for
dialogue, but he said the United States would not take any action
until it had studied the problem thoroughly and talked to all the
players.
   ``I can understand that they would like to be in touch with all
the parties to the conflict before they move,'' Hussein said. ``But
I hope that this wouldn't take too long a period of time.''
   The King said the United States should begin consultations with
the other four permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council _ the Soviet Union, England, France and China _ on convening
an international peace conference later this year.
   Such a conference would serve as an umbrella for direct
Arab-Israeli peace talks, including the Palestine Liberation
Organization, and the superpowers would not be allowed to veto or
impose solutions, Hussein said.
   Secretary of State James Baker has said the United States might
be willing to consider an international conference but only if it
leads to direct Arab-Israeli talks and does not interfere.
   The Soviets, who have become much more involved in the Middle
East in recent months, support an international conference. Israel
has generally rejected the idea although there have been indications
it might compromise under certain circumstances.
   Bush will have a chance for detailed discussions on the matter
when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir visits here in April.
