   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24 with 1,071 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. What do you think will be the most important problem facing
