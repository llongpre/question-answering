<HEAD>Bush Says United States Will Pay Its Dues To United Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said on Monday the United States
soon will pay its $62.5 million dues to the United Nations and plans
to deal with the huge unpaid bill to the world body accumulated
during Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   The subject of U.S. payments to the U.N. came up during a meeting
between Bush and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Afterward, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
regards money owed to the U.N. as ``solemn international obligations
made by the United States after full consultation with Congress.''
   Beginning in 1985, the Reagan administration began withholding
some of its the U.S. dues to protest what it said was the U.N.'s
anti-Western bias, inefficiency and budget overruns.
   In September 1988, Reagan announced he was pleased with the world
body's progress toward budget reform, staff cutbacks and a new
spirit of consensus and cooperation. But he left the details of
paying the arrears to Bush.
   Bush said he hopes Congress will provide money to pay off
approximately $460 million in delinquent dues.
   Bush has proposed a five-year payoff scheme to Congress. U.S.
dues to the the U.N. run about $240 million. In addition to the
regular budget, there also are fees for peacekeeping activities.
