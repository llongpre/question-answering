Chief U.S. arms negotiator Richard R. Burt declared Tuesday that the Bush 
Administration's proposals to seek ways of verifying any reduction in strategic 
arms should accelerate steps toward such an agreement in the talks here. 
</P>
<P>
He denied that the Administration, after a long review of the START 
negotiations, had decided to slow progress toward a treaty in favor of pushing 
the conventional arms talks in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no higher priority" than the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, Burt 
said, echoing the statement President Bush made in Washington on Monday as the 
new round of talks began here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insists on No Linkage 
</P>
<P>
Burt, who comes to the arms post after serving as ambassador to West Germany, 
also insisted that there be no linkage between a START agreement and the 
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) of then-President Ronald Reagan, popularly 
known as "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not think the START agreement should be held hostage to agreements on 
space or our legal rights to SDI," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
This position placed the United States in direct opposition to the view 
enunciated Monday by the chief Soviet negotiator, Yuri K. Nazarkin, who 
indicated that agreement on limiting nuclear missiles is contingent on 
adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Under that agreement, the 
Soviet negotiators argue, the United States is not allowed to test or deploy 
weapons in space. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 sessions of bargaining over four years, the United States and the Soviet 
Union have completed an estimated 80% to 90% of a strategic arms treaty aimed 
at reducing the number of their intercontinental nuclear missiles by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emphasis on Verification 
</P>
<P>
After its review of the negotiations, the Bush Administration announced Monday 
that it wants to put new emphasis on finding ways to verify long-range nuclear 
arms cuts, perhaps even before completing a treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Burt said the United States is not presenting this emphasis on verification on 
a take-it-or-leave it basis. Rather, he said, the United States is seeking 
realistic verification procedures in order "to win the necessary political 
support" in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
He said that "verification is not the centerpiece of the talks but a 
component," adding: "We see this as expediting our purpose (to reach an 
accord), not to slow down the process but the opposite. We want to make as much 
progress as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Burt declined to estimate the time needed to reach an accord on a START treaty, 
declaring, "In this business, we don't talk about time frames."
