   Americans overwhelmingly favor the U.S.-Soviet
medium-range nuclear missile treaty but share fears in Congress
that Moscow cannot be trusted to comply, according to a Media
General-Associated Press poll.
   The poll also found that Americans view Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev nearly as favorably as they do President Reagan, and
Gorbachev out-polls Reagan among college-educated Americans.
   Seventy-three percent of those polled in the national survey
supported the accord to eliminate medium-range missiles, and as
many said they would back a treaty to cut each nation's long-range
arsenal in half.
   But 61 percent said the Soviets can't be trusted to live up to
their arms control agreements. That reflected sentiment in the
Senate, which last week demanded clarification of the anti-cheating
rules in the pact.
   The poll was conducted among a random sample of 1,204 adults
interviewed by telephone from April 29-May 8, ending less than a
month before Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Moscow.
   As strongly pro-treaty as they were, a near-majority of
Americans were not willing to drop Reagan's proposed missile
defense system known as ``Star Wars'' in exchange for a Soviet
agreement to a big cut in nuclear arms. Forty-nine percent opposed
such a trade while just one-third supported it.
   The public was split on the issue along political and
ideological lines: Republicans and conservatives strongly opposed
dropping Star Wars for a big missile cut, while Democrats and
liberals favored such an agreement.
   Without an agreement, 56 percent said work on Star Wars should
proceed as it is now or be increased, while 30 percent said it
should be reduced or dropped. There again was a political division:
73 percent of Republicans wanted work on Star Wars kept up,
compared with 41 percent of Democrats.
   Similarly, there was an ideological division in support for the
medium-range treaty and for a treaty, if one can be reached, to
halve the long-range arsenals. The pacts fared worst among
conservatives _ 20 percent were opposed _ and best with liberals,
whose opposition was in single digits. About 67 percent of
conservatives and 83 percent of liberals were in favor.
   The survey found broad support for Reagan's handling of
U.S.-Soviet relations, with 71 percent approving, and a high
positive view of Reagan generally, with 59 percent rating him
favorably.
   Nearly as many _ 54 percent _ expressed a positive view of
Gorbachev, the poll found. Among college graduates, 71 percent
rated Gorbachev favorably while 62 percent viewed Reagan favorably;
among those who have done postgraduate work, 76 percent saw
Gorbachev favorably, compared with 50 percent favorable for Reagan.
   Reagan had the approval of the poll's respondents for his May
29-June 2 summit with Gorbachev in Moscow. Seventy-eight percent
said the president and the Soviet leader should meet at regular
intervals even without any major items on the agenda.
   The survey gave a mixed report on U.S.-Soviet competition.
Forty-one percent said the United States had more political
influence in the world and just 14 percent said the Soviets had
more political influence. Thirty-eight percent said the countries
were about equally influential.
   The rating was closer on military strength: 33 percent said the
Soviets were stronger militarily, 28 percent said the United States
was stronger and 29 percent said the countries were about equally
strong.
   Poll respondents largely rejected the opinion of critics that
nuclear arms treaties may increase the chance of non-nuclear war. A
majority said the medium-range missile treaty would not make much
difference in the chance of conventional war in Europe, and 26
percent said it would decrease the chance.
   Just 11 percent said the treaty would increase the chance of
conventional war in Europe. That figure doubled, though, when
respondents were asked if abolition of all U.S. and Soviet nuclear
weapons would increase the chance of non-nuclear war; 22 percent,
still a minority, said it would.
   The poll had a margin of sampling error of three points. Media
General Inc., a communications company based in Richmond, Va.,
publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader,
the Tampa (Fla). Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and
