   Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick,
picked Tuesday as a featured speaker for the Republican National
Convention, praised George Bush although she had campaigned against
him earlier and faulted Democrat Michael Dukakis for lacking
foreign policy experience.
   Dukakis' shortcoming, she suggested, was partly due to the fact
that ``Massachusetts is a lot further from any foreign borders''
than California, where Ronald Reagan was governor before running
for president.
   Kirkpatrick, who endorsed Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole for
president during the primaries, spoke highly of Bush on Tuesday,
especially in comparison with Dukakis.
   ``I believe he understands a very great deal more about foreign
policy than Michael Dukakis does,'' she told reporters in a news
conference at the Republican National Committee. ``I don't know
Michael Dukakis personally, but we all know that he has had no
opportunity in his life to really devote himself to foreign
affairs. He has been concerned above all with local and state
affairs and George Bush has been concerned with the world.''
   Kirpatrick, who was once active in the Democratic Party, gave a
well-received speech at the 1984 Republican Convention.
   RNC chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said there was no link
between the Kirkpatrick announcement and the Democrats' choice on
Monday of Texas Treasurer Ann Richards as their convention keynote
speaker. Fahrenkopf said the GOP keynoter would be announced in the
next few days.
   Kirkpatrick was asked why she thinks Ronald Reagan had more
foreign policy experience when he took office in 1981 _ after two
terms as governor of California _ than Dukakis.
   ``I believe he did ... in several ways,'' she said. ``First of
all, Ronald Regan had a very active interest in foreign policy
through decades of his life. That interest is a matter of record.
It was supplemented by quite a lot of traveling and speaking for
the United States in foreign countries. The first time I ever saw
Ronald Reagan was in Tokyo in the mid-70s. ...
   ``As governor of California, he had developed a very lively
interest in relations with Mexico and Central America. The first
conversations I ever had with Ronald Reagan were about U.S.-Mexican
and -Central American relations.
   Then she went on:
   ``You know, Massachusetts is a lot further from any foreign
borders ... from troublesome foreign borders than California. ... I
don't think Dukakis' background shows the same kind of persistent
concern either with foreign travel or foreign experience ... that
Ronald Reagan did.''
   Kirkpatrick's news conference opened with her being asked about
comments attributed to her in a party press release.
   ``May I just say nobody writes for me. I mean that quite
seriously _ I write my own things,'' she said.
   Then a reporter read aloud the release, which said Dukakis'
statements on foreign policy ``have been irresponsible and naive.''
Asked if those were in line with here own thoughts, she replied:
   ``I'm afraid so. I regret that's what I think. I believe that
Dukakis lacks the experience in foreign affairs and foreign policy
and national security that a president of United States badly needs
at this time.''
   She said Bush's experience ``is great enough to give his vision
of a strong America content. ... He knows what will make us
strong.''
