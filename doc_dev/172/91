   Today is Friday, Feb. 3, the 34th day of 1989. There are 331 days
left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   In 1959, it was ``the day the music died'' as a plane crashed
near Clear Lake, Iowa, killing rock 'n' roll stars Buddy Holly,
Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``The Big Bopper'' Richardson, as well as
pilot Roger Peterson.
   On this date:
   In 1690, the first paper money in America was issued by the
colony of Massachusetts. (The currency was used to pay soldiers
fighting a war against Quebec.)
   In 1783, Spain recognized U.S. independence.
   In 1809, the territory of Illinois was created.
   In 1865, a conference aimed at ending the Civil War that included
President Abraham Lincoln and Confederate Vice President Alexander
H. Stephens took place on the River Queen off the Virginia coast.
   In 1913, the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, providing for a
federal income tax, was ratified.
   In 1917, the United States broke diplomatic relations with
Germany after the Germans announced a policy of unrestricted
submarine warfare.
   In 1924, the 28th President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson,
died at his home in Washington at age 68.
   In 1930, the Chief Justice of the United States, William Howard
Taft, resigned for health reasons.
   In 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed a 12-member commission
to investigate the Challenger disaster that claimed the lives of the
entire space shuttle crew.
   Ten years ago: A hung jury resulted in a mistrial in the case of
U.S. Rep. Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa., who was accused of bribery,
conspiracy and perjury. (Flood resigned from the House in 1980.)
   Five years ago: The space shuttle Challenger blasted off from
Cape Canaveral, Fla., on a problem-plagued mission that would
include the faulty deployment of two satellites and a target
balloon. (The crew included mission specialist Ronald McNair, who
died in the Challenger explosion in January 1986.)
   One year ago: The U.S. House of Representatives handed President
Ronald Reagan a major defeat, rejecting his request for at least
$36.25 million in aid to the Nicaraguan Contras by a vote of 219-211.
   Today's Birthdays: Author James Michener is 82. Comedian Shelley
Berman is 63. Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., is 56. Former football
quarterback Fran Tarkenton is 49. Actress Blythe Danner is 46.
Former football quarterback Bob Griese is 44. Singer-guitarist Dave
Davies is 42. Actress Morgan Fairchild is 39.
   Thought for Today: ``It was naive of the 19th century optimists
to expect paradise from technology _ and it is equally naive of the
20th century pessimists to make technology the scapegoat for such
old shortcomings as man's blindness, cruelty, immaturity, greed and
sinful pride.'' _ Peter F. Drucker, American government official.
