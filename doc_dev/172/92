<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Muslim Premier Haris Silajdzic by </F>
Bob Kroon in Geneva; date not given: "Silajdzic Counts on 
American-Russian Cooperation"; first two paragraphs are GAZET 
VAN ANTWERPEN introduction] 
  [Text] Although the talks in Geneva have stalled, the 
diplomatic activity is more hectic than ever just one week 
before possible actions by NATO. The United States is counting 
on "Russia playing a constructive role," and expects Moscow to 
exert pressure on Serbian President Milosevic. Meanwhile, 
together with Germany and Turkey, the United States will place 
Croatian President Tudjman and Bosnian Leader Izetbegovic under 
pressure. 
  Bosnian Muslim Premier Haris Silajdzic says that he is very 
pleased with Clinton's radical change of tack. "The Serbs could 
always count on the support of the Russians, whereas Washington 
kept out of harm's way," he said, before returning to Sarajevo. 
"Now the balance has finally been restored. Bosnia is not an 
isolated problem. It concerns Europe and the whole world. The 
ultimatum should have been announced last year, then a great 
deal of suffering would have been spared." 
  [Kroon] Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic has said that he will 
only withdraw his heavy weapons if the numerically stronger 
Muslim troops return to their barracks. Was that the agreement? 
  [Silajdzic] Absolutely not. There are more than eight 
million Serbs, several times the number of Bosnian Muslims. 
However, we are much more motivated, because we are fighting 
for our homeland. Karadzic is bluffing. I do not think that he 
wants NATO on his back. 
  [Kroon] Karadzic says that air strikes would mean the end of 
NATO, and he cannot guarantee the protection of international 
aid workers in the chaos that might result from them. 
  [Silajdzic] That is laughable. And as for the aid convoys, 
the Serbs are protecting them so well that most of them never 
even reach their destination. 
  [Kroon] You feel strengthened by U.S. support. Does that 
mean that you will no longer be satisfied with a tripartite 
division, according to which the Muslims are allocated 33 
percent of Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] We are still proceeding on the basis of a 
three-way split. However, the issue is not whether we get 33 or 
33.3 percent. We want habitable areas in both eastern and 
western Bosnia, areas to which the refugees can return. 
  [Kroon] Do you see any possibilities of forming a coalition 
with the Croats, now that Nationalist Leader Boban has been 
shunted onto the sidelines? 
  [Silajdzic] That would be an extremely logical development. 
The new delegation leader Akmadzic seems willing to cooperate. 
A coalition between the Muslims and Croats would solve a number 
of problems, both for us and for them. However, Akmadzic is 
still demanding Mostar as the capital of Croatian territory in 
Bosnia, and we cannot accept this. The majority of the 
population of Mostar is Muslim, it is not a Croatian city. 
Furthermore, it was they who barbarously reduced Mostar -- one 
of the most beautiful cities in Europe -- to rubble. Mostar 
belongs to all sectors of the population. 
  [Kroon] What is your view of the new developments? 
  [Silajdzic] I hope that the Russians actually cooperate with 
the United States. If they do, then the problem can be resolved 
within several months. However, President Yeltsin is facing 
difficulties. Many Russian generals regard people like Karadzic 
and General Mladic as some kind of brothers-in-arms. Moreover, 
we should not underestimate the problem posed by someone like 
Zhirinovskiy, as happened way back in the case of derided artist 
Adolf Hitler. However, it is not Zhirinovskiy himself, but 
rather what he embodies that is the issue -- the frustrations 
and apparent hopelessness of the situation in Russia. That 
neofascist Milosevic in Belgrade remains one of the main guilty 
parties. If the Russians can bring him into line, then we will 
have come a whole step further.
