   Former President Ronald Reagan, winding up a
nine-day visit to Japan, said today that Americans do not feel
their products have fair access to Japanese markets and called for
a Pacific free trade zone.
   Addressing 400 prominent businessmen in the western port of
Osaka, Reagan said Japan and the United States should ``put this
step-by-step bickering behind us and embrace a trade vision that is
encompassing.''
   ``We are the two greatest economic powers in the world,'' Reagan
said. ``Let us leap beyond our no-win squabbling by undertaking a
breathtaking plan ...a free trade zone between the U.S. and Japan.''
   In earlier appearances during his current visit, Reagan glossed
over trade disputes to emphasize positive aspects of bilateral
ties. Today, he took direct aim at Japanese policy.
   Americans admire Japan, he said, but ``Sixty-eight percent of
Americans find the economic threat from Japan to be a more serious
threat...than the military threat from the Soviet Union.''
   ``The notion is wrong,'' but Americans believe U.S. products do
not get fair access in Japan, he said.
   Japan enjoyed a $52 billion trade surplus with the United States
last year, according to U.S. figures.
   Reagan said the principle of fairness had been a ``very strong
strain'' among Americans, referring to the unfair treatment from
Britain that provoked the Boston Tea Party in 1773. ``We don't want
a Japanese tea party,'' he said.
   In another criticism of Tokyo's policies, the former president
warned Japan faced possible boycotts of its products over practices
of drift-net fishing and logging in tropical rain forests.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, who arrived in Japan Oct. 20, left
for the United States today aboard a Boeing 747 chartered by their
hosts, the Fujisankei Communications Group, Japan's largest media
conglomerate.
   They shared the jet with 230 family members of U.S. military
personnel stationed in Japan who hitched a free ride with them to
the Orient.
   The Reagans, in Japan at the invitation of the government and
Fujisankei, have not commented on reports Reagan will receive about
$2 million for his appearances on television and at charitable
events during his visit.
   Fujisankei reportedly spent $7 million on the entire visit,
which has been seen as an opportunity to improve Japan's ties with
the United States.
