   The fires will again surround this
bend-of-the-road outpost in the fall to burn off the sugarcane
greenery and expose the stalks to the cutters' machetes.
   But while growers in the rich mucklands south of Lake Okeechobee
prepare for this ancient harvest ritual, officials in Washington are
talking about a different kind of slashing for the domestic sugar
industry.
   With the sugar-subsidy program expiring next year, manufacturer
and consumer groups have begun campaigning to trim a system they
claim unfairly restricts foreign competition and costs taxpayers
billions of dollars by keeping U.S. raw sugar nearly double the
world price.
   The reform effort, shepherded by the well-funded Sweetener Users'
Association, is calling for a nearly 33 percent reduction in the
government's guaranteed sugar price of 18 cents per pound, about 6
cents higher than on foreign commodity markets. Raw sugar currently
sells for about 22 cents a pound on U.S. markets.
   Under the 1985 Farm Bill, growers have been able to receive an
18-cent-a-pound loan using their crop as collateral. They have
either six months to pay back the Commodity Credit Corp. with
interest or forfeit the sugar.
   ``Our view is simple. The price is too high,'' said Thomas
Hammer, president for the Washington-based users' group,
representing trade associations and major manufacturers such as
Hershey Foods Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. ``Keeping the price high makes
products cost more and takes money out of the taxpayers' pocket.''
   Hammer claims the program costs U.S. consumers about $3 billion a
year and encourages farmers in the Midwest to grow more profitable
sugar beets rather than food crops, such as wheat or barley.
   ``We callthat the $3 billion lie,'' said Barbara Miedema,
spokeswoman for the Florida Sugar Cane League Inc., representing
about half the nation's sugar cane growers.
   Ms. Miedema and other representatives of the nation's estimated
12,000 sugarcane and sugar beet growers say the price supports and
import quotas are necessary to balance competition from other
countries with heavily subsidized sugar industries.
   For example, she said the European Economic Community nations buy
sugar from beet growers at 28 to 30 cents a pounds for domestic
consumption, then dump the surplus on world markets.
   The United States, one of the few nations where sugar demand
outpaces domestic production, would be flooded with inexpensive
foreign sugar if the import quotas were lifted, she said. The United
States now imports about 14 percent of its sugar.
   ``We'd just be letting another domestic industry go down the
drain,'' she said.
   The federal sugar program was adopted in 1981 following years of
fluctuating prices, which peaked at near 60 cents a pound in 1980.
Further reform was taken after a flood of imported sugar in 1984
dropped prices and growers defaulted on $77 million in loans. In
1985, the loan rate was set at 18 cents a pound and strict import
quotas were established.
   Since 1981, the shelf price has remained between 33 cents and 39
cents a pound.
   Each September, U.S. agriculture officials announce the expected
domestic sugar production and set import levels. The forecast for
this season is domestic production of about 7.3 million tons and
imports of about 1.2 million tons. Leading importers include the
Dominican Republic, Philippines and Brazil.
   But the Bush administration is now studying the quotas following
a ruling in June by the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade that the program violated international trade pacts.
   To comply with GATT, the United States would have to set limits
on domestic sugar production.
   Some advocates of scrapping the quotas claim it would help the
economies of struggling Caribbean nations, including Jamaica and
Barbados, which send thousands of workers to cut cane each year in
the United States under a special immigration policy.
   Meanwhile, sugar demand in the United States is falling. Refined
sugar consumption last year was estimated at 7.8 million tons, down
from more than 10 million tons in 1979, Department of Agriculture
figures show. Use of corn-based sweeteners has more than doubled
during the same period.
   Florida _ where growers also face legal challenges from
environmentalists worried about chemical fertilizer runoff into the
Everglades _ produced about 1.5 million tons of sugar last year.
Hawaii, Louisiana and Texas combined for nearly 2 million tons.
   Minnesota leads the 13 principal sugar beet states, which
produced about nearly 3.9 million tons of refined sugar last year.
   A report released in August by the American Sugar Alliance
estimated the sugar industry, including corn sweeteners, generates
$18.5 billion a year in wages and revenue in 42 states.
   The first public hearing by the House Agriculture Subcommittee on
Cotton, Rice and Sugar was held last month in Colorado and several
others are planned before spring. The subcommittee will then begin
taking testimony on the Farm Bill in Washington.
   ``Talk of change is definitely in the air, but the options are so
limitless at this point it's hard to predict,'' said Jim Terrill,
senior vice president at the United States Sugar Corp. in Clewiston,
the nation's oldest sugar cane plant. ``We're all watching it real
closely.''
