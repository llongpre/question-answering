  [Text] Opposition lawmakers yesterday alleged that South 
Korea has bowed to U.S. pressure and has agreed to further lower 
import tariff rates on 33 American farm products from the 
current 40 percent to 20 percent on average. During a session of 
the National Assembly agriculture committee, two Democratic 
Party (DP) lawmakers said the agreement was included in the 
"side letter" between the two countries with regard to 
modification of the nation's final schedule of tariff 
concessions in the farming sector. 
  Citing a report on tariffs on agreed items between Korea and 
the United States submitted by the Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries Ministry to the Assembly committee, Reps. Yi Kil-chae 
and Yi Kyu- taek insisted that the Seoul government made 
considerable tariff concessions to the United States on major 
agricultural items through the side letter. 
  Among the 33 items dropped in the agreement are wheat, corn 
chips, sweet corn and almonds. For example, they said, tariff 
rates on wheat will be lowered from the current 10 percent to 3 
percent. 
  Rep. Yi contended that the nation's farming industry is 
expected to be dealt a serious blow by an influx of American 
farming goods in the wake of a sharp reduction of tariffs. 
  Rep. Yi urged the government to make public the full 
contents 
of the side letter, saying that there is a possibility that the 
two countries might have made another secret agreement. 
  Another DP lawmaker Kim Yong-chin charged that the 
government 
failed to keep its promise not to revise the final country 
schedule, calling for the National Assembly to immediately set 
up a fact- finding team to probe into why the government 
modified the schedule. 
  The team also should discover the truth about whether there 
was any secret negotiations between Seoul and Washington to open 
the domestic farming market wider, Kim claimed. 
  DP lawmaker Kim Chang-kon criticized the government for its 
revision of the final country schedule, saying that the 
government had cheated farmers and forced them to sacrifice. He 
demanded that President Kim Yong-sam offer an apology to the 
public and dismiss relevant ministers. 
  In response to lawmakers' allegations, a spokesman of the 
agriculture ministry said the 33 farming products are the items 
under which the two countries had already agreed to reduce 
tariff rates during bilateral negotiations in December 1993. 
  Testifying before the committee, Kim Yang-pae, the minister 
of agriculture, offered an apology to the public, saying that he 
feels sorry for creating "unnecessary" misunderstanding by 
failing to make public the modifications of the country 
schedule. But Kim dismissed some allegation that South Korea 
made further concessions through the side letter as totally 
untrue. He told lawmakers that the side letter was exchanged 
between ambassadors of the two countries to guarantee the 
bilateral agreements and there is no secret agreement with any 
country.
