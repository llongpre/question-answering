   The government accused the United
States on Thursday of looking for a pretext to invade Panama, and
said it ordered its military not to harm Americans in the country.
   Government offices closed Thursday for a long Easter weekend
that looks bleak for 130,000 public employees, who were left
without paychecks for the second time this month.
   An eerie quiet gripped the streets of Panama City, which had
been filled in recent days with demonstrations against Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the Defense Forces commander who controls the
civilian government.
   Manuel Solis Palma, the president installed by Noriega, said in
a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that
U.S. armed forces in Panama and its waters constituted a threat to
the country.
   ``In spite of the situation created by the mobilization of U.S.
forces ... the Defense Forces of Panama have orders to refrain from
using lethal or destructive weapons at any time against the armed
forces of the United States or against U.S. civilians,'' said the
letter, released by the presidency.
   The ``mobilization'' of forces apparently referred to the
passage this week of the U.S. helicopter carrier Okinawa through
the Panama Canal, and U.S. military maneuvers in Panama that began
in early March.
   ``Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic
of Panama ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a
charge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching of
acts of war against Panama,'' the letter said.
   The Reagan administration has raised the possibility that the
U.S. military might be used to protect the estimated 50,000
American citizens in Panama against possible harrassment by that
country's security forces.
   It made the suggestion after Panamanian soldiers arrested and
beat several journalists, including American reporters, during a
raid Monday on a Panama City hotel.
   With most businesses and industries observing an 11-day-old
general strike against Noriega Thursday, the largest congregations
of people in Panama City were found in the food lines of welfare
agencies.
   Leaders of the National Civic Crusade were meeting to plan new
strategies in their frustrated effort to oust Noriega.
   ``We'll be talking over the weekend, discussing where we go from
here,'' said Roberto Aleman, a director of the Crusade, a coalition
of about 200 professional, business, labor, political and other
groups.
   In Caracas, former President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela
said he understood Noriega had promised to resign in May, the
unofficial start of a presidential campaign leading to elections in
May 1989. The general is under indictment in the United States on
drug trafficking charges.
   Major supermarkets and drug stores, and a few small shops, were
open Thursday in Panama City but most merchants observed the
strike. The groceries and pharmacies reopened Wednesday _ under
heavy government pressure, according to reports.
   The government closed its doors without meeting another $33
million payday for most ot its 130,000 employees despite the
collection this week of $19 million in quarterly tax revenues.
   About $5.5 million was said to be taxes and fees from U.S.
companies doing business in Panama, including Texaco, Eastern
Airlines and a banana-growing subsidiary of United Brands.
   In Washington, the White House announced tax incentives and
other measures Thursday to encourage American companies to withhold
payments from Panama. The Reagan administration said mandatory
action would be considered if the voluntary measures are not
sufficient.
   Most Panamanians were short of cash and food as a result of the
strike and the cash crisis, which was caused in part by a U.S.
freeze on Panamanian assets in American banks.
   The sanctions were imposed in February after Noriega supporters
in the National Assembly voted to oust Panama's civilian president,
Eric Arturo Delvalle, in retaliation for Delvalle's attempt to fire
Noriega.
   Banks have been closed since March 3.
   At a news conference in Caracas, Perez said Noriega had promised
Monsignor Marcos Antonio McGrath, the Catholic archbishop of
Panama, that he would step aside upon completion of his term of
service in May.
   But by law, military officers in Panama are supposed to resign
after 25 years of active service, and Noriega's official biography
shows that he entered the service in 1962, or 26 years ago.
   Perez and the leaders of Costa Rica and Spain asked McGrath to
serve as a mediator between Noriega and his opponents.
