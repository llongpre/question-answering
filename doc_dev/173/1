  [Text] Washington, June 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today held a welcome ceremony for Japanese Emperor 
Akihito and Empress Michiko at the White House South Lawn. 
  "Your Majesties visit us at a moment when it is clear that 
the destinies of our two peoples are inextricably linked," 
Clinton said at the ceremony attended by about 4,000 people. 
  "We share a common vision. It is a vision of democracy and 
prosperity... [ellipses as received], of a world where we trade 
freely in ideas and goods," Clinton said. 
  "Our commitment to common ideals is firm, our determination 
to work with you is strong," Clinton added. 
  Emperor Akihito said that "Our two countries have overcome 
the deplorable rupture brought about by war and have forged a 
close and cooperative relationship." 
  "I sincerely hope that this visit will further contribute to 
the promotion of friendship between our two peoples," the 
emperor said. 
  The emperor and empress were greeted with full honors 
including a 21-gun salute. 
  They will attend a state dinner in the Rose Garden of the 
White House hosted by President Clinton this evening. 
  The couple arrived in Atlanta June 10 for the first leg of 
their 16-day tour in the United States. They plan to visit 11 
U.S. cities. 
  They will leave Washington Wednesday [15 June] and travel to 
the University of Virginia and then on to New York.
