   Reporters bowed in respect as Japan's Emperor
Akihito broke with imperial tradition Friday and held the throne's
first televised news conference since 1975.
   Akihito, seated beside Empress Michiko, began the news
conference by expressing gratitude to 10,000 people who attended
the state funeral and the hundreds of thousands who lined the
streets after his father, Hirohito, died in January at 87.
   ``What I felt while I was in personal contact with Emperor Showa
gives me, I think, an important guideline in what an emperor should
be,'' said Akihito, referring to Hirohito's posthumous name.
   Hirohito's 62-year reign _ the longest in Japanese history _
covered Japan's disastrous war in Asia and its subsequent rise to
an economic superpower.
   Because of the constitution's strict ban on his exercising
political powers, Akihito could not comment on the crisis facing
Japan's governing conservatives, plagued by money and sex scandals.
   He said he would be willing to visit China and Korea _ two
victims of Japanese aggression _ if the government decided it was
appropriate. He said the same for Okinawa, Japan's southernmost
prefecture, where many people remain bitter about the casualties
and destruction they bore in the U.S. military assault. Hirohito
never visited Okinawa after the war.
   Akihito said the Daijo-sai, an elaborate ascension rite with
strong Shinto significance, should be carried out in accordance
with the law. Many critics already argue that by its very nature it
violates the constitution's ban of state involvement in religious
affairs.
   In that mystical ceremony to be held next year, Akihito is to
have his first communion with the gods and then be reborn divine.
Media reports have estimated it could cost as much as $70 million.
The government is studying how to conduct the rite.
   Reporters representing 43 Japanese and 12 foreign news
organizations attended the news conference. Journalists were given
a detailed explanation of when to rise and bow, and who would sit
where in the palace's Stone Bridge Room, a large hall with Japanese
sliding paper doors and Western-style red carpeting.
   Sitting behind a low table draped with gold brocade cloth
embroidered with chrysanthemums, the imperial symbol, the royal
couple spoke slowly and distinctly. At times the empress, wearing a
light green dress, spoke so softly her voice was drowned out by the
clicking of cameras.
   Akihito also spoke in polite but common Japanese, unlike his
father, who often used archaic or stilted words no longer
understood by the general public.
   Akihito repeatedly stressed that his proper role is to uphold
Japan's postwar constitution, which limits his role to that of a
``symbolic'' figurehead.
   Four of the 12 main questions, all submitted weeks in advance
and subject to government approval, were about Hirohito. Along with
the main questions, several follow-ups were allowed, but by
pre-decided Japanese questioners.
   One Imperial Household Agency official requested the scheduled
time limit of 30 minutes be carefully observed, because traffic
restrictions had been set for streets on the imperial couple's way
home. The conference lasted 37 minutes.
   Akihito is the first emperor to ascend the throne under the
postwar constitution, which limits his role to mostly ceremonial
tasks. The previous constitution gave Hirohito nominal powers, and
the wartime government asserted it was acting in his name.
   The constitution also omits all references to the emperor's
special relationship with the gods of Shinto, Japan's indigenous
religion, which angers some conservatives.
   Japan's monarchy can trace its history to at least the 8th
century, and by legend until the 6th century B.C. and Emperor
Jimmu, who is said to have descended from the sun goddess,
Amaterasu.
   Michiko, rarely changing her expression of polite concentration,
said that because of her husband's heavy responsibilities she must
``make the home a place where he can...find peace and relaxation
with his family.''
   The royal couple split with the past by raising their two sons
and daughter by themselves. Akihito was raised by chamberlains from
age 3.
   Their eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, 29, is now seeking a
bride, and when asked about his growing independence, Michiko said,
``It would make me happy if he would come, even if only from time
to time, to play the viola for us.''
