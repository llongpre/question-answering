   Just as a few chosen farmers have done for more
than 1,000 years, Susumu Anai on Wednesday harvested ``sacred''
rice for his emperor to offer the gods in a mystical ritual of
enthronement.
   The harvest, conducted under heavy security, completed the
gathering of rice that Emperor Akihito is to offer to the gods of
Shinto, Japan's native religion, next month.
   But, unlike in times of old when Japan's monarchs were revered
as living gods and Shinto was the national religion, questions have
been raised about the rite's constitutionality and whether it
should be performed.
   Palace and local government officials looked on silently as
Anai, clad in white cotton robes and wearing the type of tall black
hat worn by religious and court officials centuries ago, entered a
talisman-ringed paddy and cut several plants to place on a wooden
altar.
   The hourlong ritual on Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu
followed a similar harvest two weeks ago in Akita, in the
northeast. By tradition, one paddy must be to the west and one to
the east of Kyoto, Japan's former capital.
   ``Having the paddy of my ancestors chosen makes me feel both
honor and the weight of responsibility,'' said Yoichiro Ito, the
Akita farmer whose paddy was used for the rice.
   ``It was rice that I had just grown like the rest,'' Ito said in
a telephone interview. ``As a farmer this is a great honor.''
   Emperor Akihito will offer the rice and several other kinds of
food to the gods in the mystical Daijosai, or ``Great Food Offering
Ritual,'' on Nov. 22-23 after his Nov. 12 coronation.
   Akihito ascended the throne after his father, Hirohito, died in
January last year. His formal enthronement, however, had to await a
one-year mourning period and the growing of rice for the Daijosai.
   After communing with the gods in two halls at the Tokyo Imperial
Palace, Akihito is to sleep with the spirit of the sun goddess
Amaterasu, from whom the imperial line is said to have descended.
   The Daijosai was largely ignored in the 15th and 17th centuries,
but otherwise has been performed regularly for at least 1,200
years.
   Because Akihito will be the first monarch to be enthroned under
Japan's post-World War II constitution, his coronation is under
particularly close scrutiny.
   Nearly 1,000 people are suing Japan's conservative-led
government over plans to provide state funds for the rite, which is
opposed by Christian, Buddhist and intellectual groups.
   Before Japan's surrender to the Allies in 1945, a nationalistic
brand of Shinto had state backing and was used by the government to
rally the people behind the war effort.
   Hirohito renounced the concept of imperial divinity soon after
the war and a new constitution written mainly by U.S. occupation
forces banned government backing of Shinto or any other religion.
   In defending the decision to provide funds, officials have
acknowledged the religious significance of the rite, but stated its
importance as an imperial tradition should take precedence.
   In February, imperial ritualists selected the location of the
two sacred paddies by heating turtle shells over charcoal until
they cracked, and then using the cracks to divine where the proper
paddies would be found.
   Only the names of the states were announced because radical
leftist groups, who oppose the monarchy, have threatened violence
to disrupt ceremonies related to the coronation.
   Radicals claimed responsibility for a fire in July that razed a
shrine in Akita and were suspected of setting a fire earlier this
week in a buidling formerly used as a train station for the
imperial family. But no incidents were reported at either harvest
ceremony.
   Ito said he was not told by local agricultural officials that
his paddy had been chosen until one month before the harvest, and
that the palace had not approached him until one week before the
rice was to be cut.
   ``The first I heard about it was on the night of Aug. 23,'' he
said. ``It was a very unexpected thing, and I was quite shocked.''
