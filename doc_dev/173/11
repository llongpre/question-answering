   Emperor Akihito today became the first
Japanese monarch to pay tribute at a monument to the 70,000 people
who died in the atomic bomb blast that devastated Nagasaki 45 years
ago.
   A steady rain fell as Akihito, accompanied by Empress Michiko,
bowed deeply and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a dark
granite cenotaph before the monument.
   Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima led Akihito to the site. Motoshima was
shot in the chest in January by an ultrarightist for saying the
late Emperor Hirohito could have helped end World War II sooner and
spared Nagasaki.
   Japan surrendered six days after the Aug. 9, 1945 atomic bombing.
   Though Hirohito, now known in Japan as Emperor Showa, visited
Nagasaki for a sporting event in 1969, his son, Akihito, is the
first emperor to present flowers at the Peace Park memorial.
   As the emperor left the park, some of the 2,600 people who
attended sang ``Kimi Ga Yo,'' Japan's unofficial national anthem.
Shouts of ``Banzai,'' a wish for long life, rang out when his
20-car motorcade arrived.
   ``The emperor is from a new generation, my generation,'' said
Sachiko Nagata, a store clerk who was seven years old when the bomb
fell. ``I think he has helped heal some of the wounds of the war by
coming here.''
   Police mobilized 4,000 officers to provide security for the
emperor and empress during their four-day visit to the city on the
southern island of Kyushu.
   The Roman Catholic mayor drew the ire of rightist groups with
his remarks about Hirohito. Before being shot, Motoshima received
countless death threats and lost his membership in the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   Japanese rightists represent a small minority but maintain a
high profile, dressing in military garb and driving through cities
in convoys of armored, painted trucks blaring march music. They are
staunchly nationalist.
   They also revere the monarchy and chastise those they believe
oppose it.
