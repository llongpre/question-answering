   When the emperor of Japan leaves his
palace in Tokyo, nothing is left to chance.
   Determined to eliminate the element of surprise, officials in
this scenic coastal city on the southern island of Kyushu have
slaved for months over preparations for the arrival Friday of
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko.
   Officials are particularly nervous because the emperor is to
meet Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima, who was shot in the back by a
rightist in January. The attacker was angry at Motoshima for saying
the late Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, bore some
responsibility for World War II.
   About 4,000 police officers were being mobilized to ensure the
monarch's safety.
   Highlighting the emperor's four-day stay will be a visit to an
atomic bomb memorial at Peace Park, and the 41st annual Arbor Day
Festival on Sunday.
   The emperor, who is to plant a tree and give a short address, is
scheduled to spend less than an hour at the festival, but officials
reportedly are spending $50,000 to deodorize a nearby pig farm.
   They also are planning to hang a curtain to keep the farm out of
the royal couple's sight, and have told media hoping to cover the
event by helicopter not to create any ruckus that might disturb the
animals.
   ``Sure, if the wind is right it could smell pretty bad at the
festival,'' said Yoichi Tanaka, head of general affairs for the
Nagasaki Prefectural Trade Union. ``But it's a pig farm, after all,
and there really isn't any need to try to hide that.''
   The strengthened police presence prompted a local newspaper, the
Nagasaki Shimbun, to complain in an editorial Thursday that
``excessive security'' could dampen ``the Nagasaki people's natural
desire to welcome their emperor.''
   The editorial, however, acknowledged the need for tight security
wherever the emperor goes. Leftist radicals strongly oppose the
monarchy and often have used violence to gain publicity for their
views.
   The same month that Motoshima was shot, leftists claimed
responsibility for firing projectiles that slightly damaged the
Tokyo home of the emperor's younger brother, Prince Hitachi.
   Public opinion polls indicate the overwhelming majority of
Japanese support the monarchy, but there also are painful memories
of World War II, when the emperor's name was used to inspire
Japan's troops.
   After the war, Hirohito, whom the Japanese now call Emperor
Showa, visited all of Japan's prefectures except Okinawa, a string
of southern islands where some of the war's bloodiest battles were
fought and where ill feelings toward Tokyo still linger.
   Radicals broke through security and hurled firebombs at Akihito
and Michiko when they visited Okinawa in 1975. Akihito, then crown
prince, and his wife narrowly escaped injury.
