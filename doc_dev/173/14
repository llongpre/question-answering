   Emperor Akihito has long lived in the shadow of his
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, and the memories of Japan's
headlong march into the Pacific War that Hirohito's name evoked.
   But as Akihito on Monday officially inherits the throne left by
his father's death, many Japanese are looking to him as the symbol
of a new age - that of the generation who experienced war as
children and rebuilt the nation in peace.
   Akihito was 11 years old at the end of World War II, during
which Japanese militarists urged the nation to battle in the name
of his father. The impact of surrender and reform under the
guidance of U.S.-led occupation forces deeply affected his youth.
   Before Akihito turned 13, Hirohito made his historic
renunciation of imperial divinity.
   The occupation troops left Japan after seven years in 1952 and
left behind them a democratic constitution that renounced war and
defined Japan's monarchs as ``symbols,'' not the priest-kings of
bygone days.
   That imperial role seems to fit Akihito, who in one of his first
duties after assuming the throne upon the death of Hirohito in
January 1989 promised to uphold the constitution ``along with the
people.''
   ``Most grieved by his late majesty's passing, I have succeeded
to the imperial throne in accordance with the constitution of
Japan,'' he said. ``Shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the
responsibilities I undertake, I stand humble before you.''
   Akihito, born on Dec. 23, 1933, bears a strong physical
resemblance to Hirohito, and has inherited his father's short,
almost frail, build. He also has his father's passion for science,
and is a respected scholar in the study of gobies, a type of
mud-sucking fish.
   Akihito speaks fluent English and is Japan's most widely
traveled emperor. He hasa made official visits to 37 countries, his
first to England for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.
   Reflecting the circumstances of his upbringing, Akihito is often
described by former schoolmates and palace officials as a more
democratic, warmer person than the quiet, reclusive Hirohito.
   He has also been far more prone to set his own precedents.
   Just three years after completing his education - Akihito was
the first emperor schooled alongside commoners - the royal heir
chose a commoner for his bride, making another break from the past.
   The woman, Michiko Shoda, was the daughter of one of the
nation's wealthiest businessmen, but their marriage in 1959 sent
shock waves through Japan's former nobility.
   To the rest of the nation, however, the wedding was welcomed as
none before. About 500,000 people lined the streets for a chance to
see Akihito and Michiko in their horse-drawn carriage during a
parade after the ceremony.
   The royal couple again broke with tradition by raising their own
children, a decision prompted in part by Akihito's desire to have
the family life he was denied as a child, according to Minoru
Hamao, a former imperial chamberlain.
   Taken away from his parents at an early age to be raised by
strangers, Akihito at times complained of the loneliness he felt
when his classmates would talk to him about their homes, said
Hamao, who served Akihito for two decades.
   Akihito's first child and heir, Crown Prince Naruhito, was born
Feb. 23, 1960. They have another son, Prince Akishino, and
daughter, Princess Nori.
   Though the crown prince remains single, Prince Akishino earlier
this year wed Kiko Kawashima - who, like the empress, had no royal
lineage.
