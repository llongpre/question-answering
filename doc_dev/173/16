   Emperor Akihito on Friday completed a centuries-old
ceremony signifying his accession to the world's oldest hereditary
throne while protests were held against the monarchy and the high
cost of the rite.
   The Shinto ceremony, symbolizing communion with the sun goddess,
has been performed by most of Japan's emperors since at least the
7th century, and in the past was believed to give monarchs their
status as living god.
   But demonstrators across the country criticized the ritual as a
violation of the Japanese constitution's separation of church and
state and questioned the use of nearly $17 million in tax money on
the ceremony.
   Other critics of the Daijosai, or Great Food Offering Ritual,
also believe holding it indicates a desire within Japan's
conservative government to bring back the emperor worship of prewar
days.
   The rite, witnessed by only two female attendants, was held
Thursday night and then repeated before dawn Friday.
   Anti-monarchy radicals marked the beginning of the ceremony by
launching six mortar-like projectiles at an imperial villa in
Kyoto, in western Japan, police said.
   Radicals were also believed to have set fires at three Shinto
shrines and four train stations outside of the capital of Tokyo
just after midnight. No injuries were reported.
   Separate peaceful protests were staged by scholars and labor
unionists, and 1,000 Christians fasted to protest the funding of
the rite.
   Akihito, 56, is the first Japanese emperor to be enthroned since
his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, assumed the Chrysanthemum
Throne 62 years ago.
   He is also the first to assume the throne under Japan's postwar
constitution, which calls him not a god-king but a symbol of his
people's sovereignty.
   Akihito's formal state enthronement ceremony Nov. 12 was viewed
by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries, but no
foreigners were invited to the communion.
   During the rite, Akihito offered rice, wine and other foods from
around the country to the sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom legend
says the imperial line descended.
   The two women attendants are clad in white and red kimono and
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6{ feet long. The
ceremony is held in the torch-lit inner sanctuary of a specially
built hall on the palace grounds.
   The rite is performed only once by each emperor.
   Inside the sanctuary, out of view of the 733 Japanese guests
seated in large tents nearby, the offerings were made to an altar
placed beside a stylized bed, from which the goddess is summoned.
   Scholars before World War II theorized that at one time the
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex
with the sun goddess, representing a union with the divine. Palace
officials, however, deny that theory and said the emperor would not
touch the bed.
   The second ceremony was repeated after midnight in an identical
hall yards from the first one.
   Akihito performs dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace
each year, carrying on the priest-king role that has been handed
down from ancient times.
   That role, however, has periodically come under fire since the
end of World War II.
   Hirohito, who died in 1989 at age 87, renounced the concept of
imperial divinity in 1946 at the urging of the U.S.-led occupation
forces. The country's post-war constitution specifies that the
emperor is a national symbol, and not a god-king.
