  [Text] Tokyo, March 26 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam renewed his hope Saturday [26 March] for the visit to 
South Korea by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, a senior 
Imperial Household Agency official said. Kim, before departing 
for China after a three-day visit to Tokyo, extended the 
invitation again to the imperial couple as they bid farewell to 
Kim and his wife Son Myong-sun at the Akasaka Palace, said 
Kiyoshi Sumiya, the agency's grand master of ceremonies. 
  Kim told the couple during the 20-minute meeting that he 
wishes to invite them to visit South Korea at a proper time. 
  During an audience at the imperial palace on Thursday, the 
president officially invited Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko 
to visit South Korea to forge a new future-oriented 
relationship. At that time, the emperor replied the Japanese 
Government would decide on whether he will go to South Korea. 
  The visit by Japan's monarch, however, is still a sensitive 
issue in South Korea, which was under Japanese colonial rule 
from 1910 to 1945. 
  During his stay in Tokyo, Kim urged Japan to work together 
to 
solve North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development 
program, which has heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, 
and stressed the importance of forward-looking bilateral 
relations.
