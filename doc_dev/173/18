   President Roh Tae-woo today said ``no
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory'' for Japan's brutal
colonization of Korea, but that Japan's expressions of regret are
the basis for a new relationship.
   Roh returned today from a three-day trip to Japan, during which
he invited Emperor Akihito to make the first Japanese imperial
visit to South Korea.
   The invitation came after Akihito expressed regret for the
colonization of Korea nearly half a century ago, and Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu extended ``honest apologies'' for Korean
suffering in the colonial period.
   Roh, upon his arrival in Seoul, said it was time for the two
countries to put the past behind them.
   ``Even if we may feel that the Japanese apologies do not fully
live up to our expectations, we should accept them with magnanimity
and generosity, now that Japan has forthrightly admitted its
mistakes,'' he said at an airport news conference.
   During the colonial period, Japan tried to stifle Korean culture
by banning Koreans from learning their language and forcing them to
adoptJapanese names. Tens of thousands of Koreans were killed after
being drafted for the Japanese war efforts.
   ``I well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have
about what went on between our country and Japan in the past. No
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory,'' Roh said.
   Some Koreans said Japanese measures to clear up current sore
points were more important than apologizing for the past.
   There are unresolved disputes over discrimination against
Koreans living in Japan, aid to Koreans who remain displaced after
being forcibly removed from their homeland to perform wartime labor
for Japan, and assistance to Korean survivors of the atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Roh said he had asked Japan to move forward on these issues and
expressed satisfaction with the progress made so far.
   About 20,000 police had been mobilized in Tokyo to provide
security for Roh during his three-day state visit against possible
threats from extreme leftist or rightist groups. But no incidents
were reported.
   Roh's visit to Tokyo was only the second by a South Korean head
of state since the two countries established diplomatic relations
in 1965. Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, visited Japan in 1984.
   Japan and Korea have a long history of enmity and sore points
still linger from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean
Peninsula.
   The centerpiece of Roh's visit was the Thursday night state
banquet at which Akihito expressed his ``deepest regret'' for the
suffering Koreans endured at Japanese hands. Kaifu offered his
``sincere remorse and honest apologies,'' and said good relations
between Japan and Korea are a basis for peace in the region.
   Roh extended the invitation to Akihito and Empress Michiko to
visit South Korea during a short meeting with the emperor today at
the Akasaka State Guesthouse, said a palace official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``After your coronation I am sure that you will visit many
countries, and I hope that you will consider visiting South Korea
also,'' the official quoted Roh as saying.
   Akihito, who assumed the throne after the death of his father,
Emperor Hirohito, will not travel abroad until after his official
coronation on Nov. 12. The coronation is traditionally delayed by a
year of mourning for the deceased emperor.
   Akihito would be the first emperor to visit South Korea since
its creation after Japan's defeat in World War II.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Kaifu
had also accepted an invitation from Roh to visit South Korea at a
mutually convenient time.
