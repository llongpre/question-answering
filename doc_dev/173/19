<HEAD>Man Throws Smoke Bomb At Emperor's Motorcade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two people threw a smoke bomb and a firecracker at
Emperor Akihito's motorcade Sunday as it headed for the Imperial
Palace in Kyoto after another of the rites of Akihitio's
enthronement, police said.
   A bystander suffered an eye injury as the firecracker landed
among people watching the motorcade pass, said an official of the
Kyoto state police.
   The man and woman, who were arrested immediately, did not
respond to police investigators' questions, the official said.
   He said they might be connected with radical leftists who
declared in leaflets last Thursday that they would ``completely
crush'' the royal couple's visit to Kyoto and nearby Nara.
   Leftist groups oppose the monarchy and say Japan's emperor
system is a symbol of militarism.
   The smoke bomb landed in the road, pouring out smoke a minute
before the car carrying Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko reached
the spot, the official said. The car slowed, but Akihito might not
have noticed the incident, he added.
