   Emperor Akihito formally assumes the world's oldest
hereditary throne Monday in lavish ceremonies that also may be an
important rite of passage for postwar Japan.
   No other monarch has ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne under the
constitution enacted in 1946.
   For the first time, a Japanese emperor is to be enthroned as
merely a national symbol, as stipulated by the constitution imposed
by the U.S. occupation after Japan's surrender in World War II.
   Most Japanese appear comfortable with the largely ceremonial
role of their new emperor, a remarkable break with the past. The
late Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, was enthroned as a living
god and was the object of fanatical devotion.
   Even the official name the government has given Akihito's reign
- Achieving Peace - reflects a desire to move away from the
turbulent times of Hirohito, who died of cancer early last year.
   The monarchy dates to the 6th or 7th century, but the Japanese
public associates it most closely with Hirohito's 60-year reign. In
that period, Japan waged expansionist wars in the name of the
emperor, suffered a crushing defeat and foreign occupation, then
rose to become an economic superpower.
   Akihito, 56, became emperor immediately after his father's
death, but his formal enthronement awaited a year of mourning and
the growing of ``sacred'' rice for a coronation rite.
   During the interval, Akihito has tried to create a softer, more
open image for the often aloof royal family, insisting on fewer
uniformed police along his procession routes and addressing people
with the title ``san,'' a term of respect similar to Mr. or Mrs. in
English.
   Reflecting the different times in which they were raised,
Akihito is believed to be more democratic in thinking than his
father, and has pledged to ``protect the constitution along with
the people.''
   Empress Michiko, the first commoner to marry a future Japanese
monarch, is crafting her own quiet revolution inside the royal
household, in large part by providing Akihito with a family life
similar to that of ``common'' Japanese.
   She broke tradition, for example, by making clear that her
children would not be taken away and raised by strangers.
   Although the palace remains distant to most Japanese, opinion
polls indicate it has wide public support. Few, however, still see
their monarch as a god.
   Government officials say they have taken pains to adapt the
enthronement ceremonies to a more democratic age. They also have
hewn closely to prewar precedent for the nearly month-long rites,
however, creating widespread concern that the ``new era'' might
actually represent a step backward in time.
   Royalty, heads of state and other dignitaries from more than 150
nations will be in Tokyo when Akihito announces his accession on
Monday.
   The main coronation ceremony will be at the imperial palace, an
oasis of greenery in cetral Tokyo built in the late 19th century
on the site of a former samurai castle.
   Akihito will ascend a 20-foot-tall throne on a three-layered
dais of black lacquer, beneath an octagonal roof adorned with
golden mirrors and phoenixes.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will stand before the throne as
Akihito, in a reddish-brown kimono with a design of paulownia
trees, bamboo and mythical animals, reads an address announcing his
accession.
   Kaifu will lead the Japanese among the 2,500 guests in three
rounds of ``Banzai!'' - a traditional cheer for long life - to
conclude the 30-minute ceremony.
   Officials say Akihito will read his announcement in colloquial
Japanese, unlike Hirohito's use of stilted classical language most
Japanese cannot understand.
   To reflect the postwar constitution's emphasis on popular
sovereignty, Kaifu will lead the banzai cheers from a point level
with the throne instead of descending several steps, as his
predecessors did.
   An official in the prime minister's office told reporters a
military salute coinciding with the enthronement would be reduced
from 100 to 21 cannon shots because ``that's the way foreign
dignitaries are received.''
   Aside from such cosmetic adjustments, Akihito's coronation is
expected to be much like those held since his great-grandfather
assumed the throne in the middle of the last century.
   In what many critics of the government see as a snub to the
constitution, about 2.5 billion yen ($17 million) in public money
will be spent on a rite steeped in Shinto, Japan's state religion
until 1945.
   In that rite, to begin 10 days after the main coronation
ceremony, Akihito will step back into the world of myth for a
``communion'' of fresh rice with the sun goddess, from whom the
imperial line is said to have descended, and all the gods of heaven
and earth.
   Opponents say public funding violates the constitutional
separation of church and state. The Kaifu administration argues
that the money is not being used to promote religion, but to
preserve an important cultural tradition.
   Critics emphasize that the rite has undergone major changes
during its 1,200 years of existence. It was ignored for more than
200 years, beginning in the late 15th century.
   In response to questions about whether holding the Daijosai, or
Great Food Offering Ritual, is intended to restore living-god
status to Akihito and future emperors, Nobuo Ishihara, the deputy
cabinet secretary, replied:
   ``I am aware that there were some scholars in the prewar period
who claimed that, through performance of the Daijosai, the emperor
assumed a divine nature. However, the government is not in a
position to make any comment as to whether the emperor does or does
not.''
   Police have begun Japan's largest security operation, mainly
because ultra-leftist radical groups have said they will disrupt
the ceremonies. A bomb believed planted by radicals exploded last
week at a Tokyo police dormitory, killing one officer and wounding
six other people.
   Late last month, 26,000 Tokyo police officers were mobilized for
security in the capital, and at least 6,000 more have been brought
in since. Nearly 45 percent of the total coronation budget of 12.3
billion yen ($94.6 million) is being spent on security.
   A high-ranking National Police Agency official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the extraordinary security was
justified because leftist radicals ``are planning to attack the
palace with explosive rockets.''
   He said police believe one group has devised mortar-like weapons
with a range of nearly four miles.
   Along with protecting the many visiting dignitaries, including
Prince Charles of Britain and Vice Presidnt Dan Quayle, the police
are concerned about security for a parade after the coronation.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko are to ride in a convertible in the
30-minute procession from the imperial palace to the royal
residence at Akasaka Palace.
   Officials say about 10,000 officers will line the three-mile
route.
