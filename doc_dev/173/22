  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to the 
United States Takakazu Kuriyama said Wednesday [25 May] Japan 
needs to take steps to significantly reduce its current account 
surplus and implement a market-opening package to successfully 
conclude the trade framework talks with the U.S. 
  Kuriyama, who is currently in Japan to prepare for the 
upcoming U.S. visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, made 
the remarks at a press conference at the Foreign Ministry. 
  He said Japan and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to get the 
deadlocked framework talks back on track because both sides 
shared the view that it is undesirable to keep tense economic 
and trade relations "drifting" since that would hurt overall 
bilateral relations. 
  Tokyo and Washington also reached the accord because it 
deepened understanding about each other's positions on the trade 
negotiations, he said. 
  Kuriyama said the greatest problem regarding economic and 
trade relations between Japan and the U.S. is that there is a 
lack of mutual trust. 
  Japan fears the U.S. will try to apply numerical targets to 
measure the openness of Japan's market and threaten sanctions if 
that target is not met, while the U.S. mistrusts Japan as a 
country always vowing to do something and then not, he said. 
  Opinion polls in both countries also show that trust and 
respect toward each others' nations are waning, Kuriyama said, 
attributing the reason to the failure of the framework 
negotiations in February. 
  The trade framework talks is aimed at boosting mutual 
understanding, he said. 
  Kuriyama, who is in Japan from Monday through Saturday, said 
he carried a message to Emperor Akihito from U.S. President Bill 
Clinton welcoming the imperial visit to the U.S. 
  Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko are scheduled to visit 
the U.S. from June 10 to 25. 
  Touching on concerns abroad that Japan may come to possess 
nuclear weapons, Kuriyama said he tries to sweep away such 
concern by explaining Japan's nonnuclear position and the 
Japanese people's feeling on the matter. 
  The ambassador said it is impossible for Japan to possess 
nuclear weapons because an overwhelming majority of the people 
are against it and because Japan is a member of the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and, therefore, has an 
international obligation not to possess nuclear weapons. 
  Also, not a single country among Japan's neighbors support 
Japan possessing nuclear weapons, he said.
