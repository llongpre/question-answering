   More than 100,000 people thronged to the Imperial
Palace on Sunday to cheer newly enthroned Emperor Akihito, but
radicals set off several bombs near a shrine he is to visit.
   Akihito, Empress Michiko and other royal family members,
protected by bulletproof glass, came out onto the palace balcony
eight times during the day to greet the well-wishers, which the
Imperial Household Agency numbered at 109,800.
   Loud shouts of ``Long live the emperor!'' rang through the
palace courtyard as he finished his short statement giving thanks
to the crowds.
   Akihito became emperor immediately after his father, Emperor
Hirohito, died in January 1989. His formal enthronement Nov. 12
followed a mourning period. Enthronement-related ceremonies are to
continue into December.
   At least four explosions occurred Sunday near the Grand Shrines
of Ise, 180 miles southwest of Tokyo, which Akihito is to visit
next week, said an official of Mie Prefectural Police who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   No injuries or major damage were reported in the explosions, two
of which occurred at the Ujiyamada railway station and two along a
railway track near the station.
   The emperor and empress are to use the railroad when they travel
to Ise to pray to the sun goddess on Nov. 27-28. Japan's line of
emperors is said to have descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu.
   Radicals claimed responsibility for dozens of explosions and
fires in Tokyo during Akihito's enthronement. None caused serious
injuries.
   The radicals oppose the monarchy as a remnant of Japan's prewar
imperialism.
