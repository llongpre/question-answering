   Japan's new imperial era was formally named
``Heisei'' _ or Achieving Peace _ to set a new tone for Emperor
Akihito's reign after the turbulence of his father's 62-year epoch,
the government announced today.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi announced the new name,
which will be used on calendars and official documents.
   Under a 1979 law, and a custom dating back 1,300 years, a new
name is assigned when a new emperor ascends Japan's 2,600-year-old
Chrysanthemum Throne.
   Emperor Hirohito died today of intestinal cancer after a 3{-month
illness. He was 87.
   His oldest son, Akihito, 55, immediately succeeded him.
   ``Heisei'' was chosen for Akihito's reign because the word,
consisting of two Chinese characters, ``includes the meaning of
achieving peace domestically, internationally and in heaven,'' Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita said in a statement.
   ``I think it is the most appropriate era name to reflect the
coming `new age,''' Takeshita said.
   The new era officially begins Sunday, with this year becoming
Heisei 1. The name was approved by Takeshita's Cabinet today, and
Akihito signed with a calligraphy brush to give the measure formal
effect.
   Reflecting Japan's postwar democratic constitution, private
citizens were included for the first time on the council that
recommended three names for the new era to the Cabinet. The group
also included Cabinet ministers, Imperial Household Agency officials
and scholars.
   The opinion of the new emperor was not given much weight.
   Hirohito's reign, which began Dec. 25, 1926, was known as Showa,
the era of ``enlightened peace.'' By the Japanese calendar, this
year was Showa 64.
   During the Showa era, Hirohito saw his nation plunge into World
War II and suffer history's first atomic attack, announced its
surrender, and later saw it rise to economic superpower status.
   On the death of Hirohito, Japan's longest-reigning monarch,
Akihito succeeded automatically to the throne, becoming the 125th
emperor in the world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same
family since at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 B.C.
   In a ceremony a few hours after Hirohito died, Akihito received
three sacred treasures _ a sword, jewels and the imperial seal _
that have been handed down through the centuries.
   Other ceremonies were expected to extend over at least two years,
ending with the formal enthronement.
   A debate over naming the eras of Japan's emperors had flared
between opposition parties and the conservative Liberal Democratic
Party, which revived the era-naming clause in 1979 after it was
dropped from the postwar constitution.
   The Socialist Party and the Communist Party favor the exclusive
use of the Western calendar and charge that naming eras violates the
constitutional provision that sovereignty rests with the Japanese
people.
   The era-naming tradition was imported from China, and reflected a
belief that the sovereign controlled time itself.
