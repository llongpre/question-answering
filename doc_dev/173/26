  [Text] In a meeting with reporters on 31 January, Kong 
No-myong, ROK ambassador to Japan, said: "It is time to hold 
full-scale discussions on ROK-Japanese cultural exchanges based 
on personnel exchanges. Particularly in this Visit Korea Year, 
the government must reexamine its tourist policy to induce 
Japanese tourists, who patronize ROK tourism the most, and 
consider adding Chinese characters to Korean signs." 
  Ambassador Kong, who returned home temporarily to attend the 
overseas mission chiefs meeting to be held here beginning 2 
February, said that our people should abandon their "new policy 
of seclusion" [saeroun swoeguk chongchaek] for 
internationalization and opening up. 
  The following are questions and answers from the meeting 
between Ambassador Kong and reporters: 
  [Unidentified reporter] Some people point out that it is too 
early for the ROK to exchange mass culture [taejung munhwa] with 
Japan in view of the present indiscriminate infiltration of 
Japanese culture. 
  [Kong No-myong] Japanese books, video tapes, and television 
programs from satellite broadcasting services are now virtually 
opened to us. We should publicly introduce high-quality mass 
culture instead of overlooking its unlawful infiltration. An 
agreement on the general opening of mass cultural markets was 
reached in ROK-Japanese summit talks held last year, but the 
details of this issue have yet to be discussed. Accordingly, we 
have to hurry to take active measures. 
  [Reporter] What are the main agenda items to be discussed 
during President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan in March? 
  [Kong] There is no pending political issue. Issues on 
economic cooperation between the ROK and Japan, such as mutual 
cooperative relations in preparation for the Uruguay Round 
treaty and methods to vitalize the ROK-Japanese Industrial and 
Technological Cooperation Committee, will be discussed. 
  [Reporter] Will President Kim meet Japanese Emperor Akihito 
when he visits Japan? Will the Japanese emperor visit the ROK? 
  [Kong] As his Japan visit is a state visit, President Kim 
will probably meet the Japanese emperor. If the Japanese 
emperor visits the ROK, it would be a significant event. The 
decision on the date of his ROK visit is a domestic affairs 
matter and must be made prudently. 
  [Reporter] Does the North Korean nuclear issue have any 
relation to the establishment of diplomatic relations between 
Japan and North Korea? 
  [Kong] Japan is willing to resume negotiations with North 
Korea whenever it wants. North Korea, however, has not yet made 
any noteworthy sign. Japan says that the resolution of the 
North Korean nuclear issue is not a prerequisite [chonje chogon] 
for Japanese-North Korean negotiations on establishment of 
diplomatic ties, although the nuclear issue is important.
