   Emperor Akihito told his people Monday that he would
obey the constitution and work for world peace, then offered a
public farewell to his late father, Hirohito.
   Akihito's remarks, his first public statement since ascending the
Chrysanthemum Throne, came one day after his father was wrapped in a
white robe and placed in a coffin, where he will lie in state for
six weeks of funeral rites.
   More than 438,000 mournings came out in drizzling rain to honor
the dead emperor at the Imperial Palace. Akihito became emperor
shortly after Hirohito died of cancer Saturday at age 87.
   The 55-year-old Akihito spoke in clear and somber tones for four
minutes. The new Empress Michiko, 54, was on his left wearing a long
black veil. The new Crown Prince Naruhito, 28, was on his right.
   ``I pledge I will be always with the people at any time and abide
by the Japanese Constitution,'' Akihito said. The postwar
constitution bans the emperor from any role in government and limits
him to ceremonial functions, signing bills into law and serving as
``symbol of the state and the unity of the people.''
   ``Based on this I will exert my responsibility. I hope for
further development of the country's fortunes and world peace and
improved welfare of the human race,'' he said.
   In Japanese tradition, Akihito's statement was his first Imperial
Rescript, a time for a new emperor to set a tone for his reign and
to mourn his predecessor.
   ``I sincerely mourn the late emperor's demise,'' Akihito said.
``Based on stipulations of the Japanese Constitution and the
Imperial rules, I hereby succeeded to the throne. ... Considering
its heavy duties, I recognize solemn feeling from the bottom of my
heart.''
   The ceremony, held in the main hall of the Imperial Palace,
lasted just seven minutes but was an important milestone in the
transition to Akihito's new imperial era of Heisei, or ``achieving
peace.''
   The simple rite was attended by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
and about 300 people from the imperial family, government,
Parliament and the judiciary.
   Hirohito will be buried Feb. 24 after lying in state for more
than six weeks, the Cabinet announced Sunday.
   Thousands of police were deployed to prevent attacks by radical
leftist and rightist groups who equate the emperor with Japanese
militarism and nationalism.
   Hirohito, died after a 62-year reign that stretched from Japan's
descent into militarism and defeat in World War II to its
astonishing recovery into an economic superpower.
   Chief palace physician Akira Takagi said doctors knew in
September 1987 that Hirohito had cancer in his upper intestinal
area, but ``for various reasons'' did not announce it or tell the
monarch.
   Japanese doctors and family members often do not tell people they
have cancer as it is considered demoralizing and because of their
belief the disease is almost always fatal and the patient will
become discouraged.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said it knew the emperor had cancer
long ago. ``This was not reported because the emperor himself had
not been informed of the true nature of his ailment,'' it said.
   Government spokesman Keizo Obuchi said the Cabinet decided
funeral costs will be shared by the government and Imperial
Household.
   Some opposition groups have warned government sponsorship of
funeral ceremonies, closely linked to Japan's native Shinto
religion, could violate constitutional separation of religion and
state.
   Hirohito is the first emperor to die under Japan's postwar
constitution. Obuchi said funeral ceremonies will be held at Tokyo's
148-acre Shinjuku Gyoen Imperial Gardens. From there, his body will
be taken in procession to an imperial mausoleum in Hachioji, 28
miles away.
   A Foreign Ministry official said dignitaries from 130 nations are
expected for the ceremony where the Akihito will preside.
   More than 60 funeral and transition rites, some simple and some
complex, are expected in coming months. Akihito's coronation will be
delayed by a year's mourning, although he automatically became
emperor when Hirohito died.
   Obuchi said security is a major concern and, ``The minister of
home affairs ... said he wants to make sure there will not be any
guerrilla incidents.''
   Hirohito officially was commander in chief of the armed forces
during World War II, which was fought by the Japanese in his name.
Most historians agree he had no direct personal role in the war, but
critics say he should have prevented Japanese aggression.
