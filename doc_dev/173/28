   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu apologized today and
Emperor Akihito expressed ``deepest regret'' for Japan's harsh
colonial rule over Korea, in statements designed to put the
nations' bitter past behind them.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo met Kaifu and the emperor on
the first day of a three-day state visit that is a carefully
scripted attempt by the two countries to move ahead as partners in
spreading peace and prosperity.
   For Japan, which normalized relations with South Korea in 1965,
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering
it inflicted during its stifling 1910-1945 rule of Korea.
   At a state banquet, Roh said the two countries ``should strive
to remove the dark shadow of history,'' but Koreans had hoped for a
more direct apology from the emperor.
   In South Korea, thousands of radical students burned Japanese
flags and fought with police today. They shouted slogans that Roh's
trip was a ``sellout to national pride.''
   Feelings still run high in South Korea over Japanese colonial
abuses. Koreans had to study Japanese in school and were taught to
worship the Japanese emperor. Koreans were drafted into the
Japanese army and into forced labor in Japan. Hundreds of thousands
died in wartime service to Japan.
   Little of this is known in Japan and the history is skimmed over
in schools. Lately, however, Japanese media have given crash
courses in Japan-Korea history with graphic photos and films of
Japanese atrocities.
   Security was heavy for Roh's visit. About 20,000 police were
mobilized in Tokyo to prevent attacks by rightist and leftist
extremists who threatened to disrupt the event. Protest rallies
were held in Tokyo.
   After a 21-gun salute, Roh and his wife were received at Tokyo's
official guest house by Emperor Akihito, Empress Michiko, Kaifu and
dozens of other Japanese officials and members of the imperial
family.
   Later, Kaifu delivered what Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo
Watanabe said was a stronger apology than any by previous prime
ministers and a more direct acknowledgement of Japan's
responsibility.
   Kaifu told Roh that Japan and South Korea must ``clearly and
honestly articulate the realities of events that have so
regrettably marred our past relations,'' Watanabe told reporters.
   Kaifu expressed his ``sincere remorse and honest apologies for
the fact that there was a period in our history in which Japan's
action inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of
the Korean Peninsula,'' Watanabe said.
   He quoted Roh as saying Kaifu's statement ``reflects a correct
recognition of history.''
   Watanabe said the Seoul government had been informed in advance
of what the prime minister and the emperor would say.
   At the state banquet, attention was focused on the ``okotoba,''
the emperor's speech. The Seoul government had asked that Akihito
apologize for Japan's actions in Korea and wanted him to state
Japan's responsibility.
   When Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, made the only previous
visit by a South Korean president in 1984, the late Emperor
Hirohito left the Koreans dissatisfied with a vague statement
expressing regret about the ``unfortunate past'' between the two
countries.
   Akihito never used the word apology in his brief speech _
government officials will use that word in later meetings _ but he
made a point of quoting Hirohito's words in 1984, and he said more.
   Hirohito had said: ``It is indeed regrettable that there was an
unfortunate past between us for a period in this century and I
believe it should not be repeated again.''
   Akihito went on to say, ``I think of the sufferings your people
underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought about
by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.''
   He also praised South Korea's economic advancement and said he
hoped the people of the two countries would together ``play
important roles for the peace and prosperity of the world.''
   In Seoul, officials indicated they were generally satisfied with
Akihito's speech. Vice Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said: ``I
think the Japanese government has made tremendous efforts to
satisfy our position.''
   In his reply, Roh said the ``dark period'' in relations between
the neighboring countries had been short, and it was time to put
``the unfortunate past truly behind us.''
   The 21st century will be the Asia-Pacific Age, he said, and
relations between the two countries would make a difference to the
wider world.
   ``For our nations ought to combine our efforts to take a leading
role in promoting peace and prosperity through the Asia-Pacific
region, an area which will become the cradle of a new civilization
harmoniously blending things East and West,'' he said.
