   For more than four decades, the bitter
memories of war and defeat clung to Emperor Hirohito. That same
ghost now haunts his son, Emperor Akihito, who on Friday paid
tribute to Nagasaki's atomic bomb victims.
   About 3,800 people stood in steady rain as Akihito, accompanied
by Empress Michiko, became the first monarch to remember the
devastating Aug. 9, 1945 attack at a monument to its 70,000 victims.
   The emperor bowed and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a
dark granite cenotaph before the Peace Park monument.
   The royal couple was greeted by loud yells of ``Banzai'' _ a
wish for long life _ when they arrived for the ceremony. And as
they left, some in the crowd sang ``Kimi Ga Yo,'' Japan's
unofficial national anthem.
   The emperor and empress later visited a hospital for patients
suffering from illness related to the bombing.
   In a statement, Akihito said that seeing the park and hospital
``renewed my thoughts for peace ... and prayers for those who still
are in pain because of the bomb's effects.''
   In Nagasaki, that pain runs deep.
   ``I think he has helped heal some of the wounds by coming,''
said store clerk Sachiko Nagata, who was seven years old when the
bomb was dropped and now suffers from radiation sickness.
   ``But it took too long for him to come to this park,'' she said.
   Though the late Hirohito visited Nagasaki for a sporting event
in 1969, his son, Akihito, is the first emperor to present flowers
at the Peace Park memorial.
   Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima was the emperor's guide on the first of
his four-day visit to southern Kyushu Island. Motoshima was shot in
January by an ultra-rightist for saying Hirohito bore some
responsibilty for the war.
   Motoshima made the comment at a city assembly meeting in
December 1988, as Hirohito lay dying of the cancer that ended his
life one month later.
   The mayor also said Hirohito could have helped end the war
sooner and saved Nagasaki from the atomic bomb. Japan surrendered
six days after the attack.
   Though many Japanese share Motoshima's opinions, his candor
angered ultra-rightist groups. For more than a year, he received
death threats.
   Since the shooting, Motoshima has become a symbol of freedom of
speech.
   Though the mayor described Akihito as a ``wonderful human
being,'' he also said the monarch should strive to understand and
heal the wounds of the past.
   ``I hope the new emperor will reflect on why that war occured,
and use his position to further peace,'' Motoshima said Friday.
   Akihito's freedom to publicly reflect on the war will be tested
three days after his visit to Nagasaki ends, when he is to meet
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo in Tokyo.
   The question of how, or even if, Akihito should apologize for
Japan's colonization of Korea from 1911 to the end of World War II
has become a major political issue between the neighbors.
   Though Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has said he plans to
apologize as the elected representative of the Japanese people,
several South Korean officials have reportedly demanded Akihito
make the apology.
   But many Japanese officials say such a ``political'' statement
by the emperor would violate the spirit of Japan's constitution,
which they say aims to limit imperial power by keeping the emperor
off the political stage.
