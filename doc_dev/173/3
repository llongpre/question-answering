   Chinese Premier Li Peng met Japan's emperor and
empress today and invited them to visit China, government officials
said.
   Li made the invitation during a 20-minute meeting with the newly
enthroned monarch at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, a senior Imperial
Household Agency official said.
   If the invitation is accepted, Emperor Akihito would be the
first Japanese monarch to visit China.
   But the palace spokesman said several problems exist and the
visit would have to await the end of a year of court mourning for
Akihito's father, Emperor Hirohito, who died on Jan. 7 at age 87.
   ``Premier Li said that he hoped the royal couple would visit
when the time was right for them. In reply, the emperor thanked him
but said the decision must be made by the government,'' said the
agency official.
   The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
said the two also discussed ``their nations' 2,000-year history,
including World War II.''
   Bitter memories of Japan's actions during World War II often
have clouded Japan-China relations. After sharp criticism by China
and other nations, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in February
retrated a statement that future historians must decide whether
Japan was an aggressor.
   More than 10 million Chinese died during Japan's 1937-45
invasion of the Chinese mainland. Beijing reacts strongly to any
Japanese attempt to deny responsibility.
   Japanese news reports have speculated that Akihito would express
regret over Japan's militarist past during today's meeting, but
government officials refused to confirm or deny this.
   ``The emperor expressed his views on the nations' pasts, and Li
welcomed those views,'' said the official.
   Earlier today, Japan announced it would lend China up to $734
million in the current fiscal year. The loan is to help fund 11
projects for modernization in China, including an expansion of
ports in Lianyungang and Qingdao and construction of a subway in
Beijing.
   Li is on a five-day official visit to Japan accompanied by
senior officials, including Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who met
today with his Japanese counterpart, Sousuke Uno.
   The last Chinese premier to visit Japan was Zhao Ziyang, now
head of China's Communist Party, in May 1982.
