   Emperor Akihito today began the most controversial
ceremony in his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, a communion
with the mythical sun goddess from whom legend says the imperial
line descended.
   The Shinto rite has been performed by most of Japan's monarchs
since at least the seventh century, and in the past was believed to
give monarchs their status as living gods.
   But protests were held across the country against the
state-funded rite, which has been criticized by many Japanese as
violating the constitution's separation of church and state.
   Hundreds of scholars in the north and labor unionists in the
west held peaceful demontrations, while hundreds of Christians
nationwide fasted.
   About 30,000 police were assigned to security in Tokyo alone
because of the threat of violence by ultra-leftist radicals who
want to abolish the monarchy.
   As the ceremony began this evening, radicals fired six metal
projectiles from homemade mortar-like launchers at an imperial
villa in Kyoto, western Japan, police said.
   Radicals were believed responsible for a fire that destroyed a
Shinto shrine in southern Japan today, police said. On Wednesday,
anti-monarchy radicals shoveled human waste from a truck near the
Imperial Palace.
   Akihito, 56, is the first Japanese emperor to be enthroned not
as a god-king but as a symbol of his people's sovereignty. But that
has not diminished the pomp and ceremony of his multimillion-dollar
coronation.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, dressed in a swallow-tailed coat,
arrived at the palace this evening to attend the communion, one of
the final events surrounding the enthronement. Nearly 900 Japanese
dignitaries were expected to attend.
   Unlike Akihito's formal state enthronement ceremony Nov. 12 that
was viewed by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries, no
foreigners were invited to the communion, which is to end before
dawn Friday.
   During the rite, called the Daijosai or Great Food Offering
Ritual, Akihito offers rice, wine and other foods from around the
country to the sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom legend says the
imperial line descended.
   Only two female attendants, clad in white and red kimono and
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6{ feet long, witness the
Daijosai. The ceremony is held in the torch-lit inner sanctuary of
a specially built hall on the palace grounds. The rite is performed
only once by each emperor.
   Akihito, wearing his most holy white silk robes for the rite and
surrounded by court chamberlains, slowly proceeded to the
sanctuary, led by two attendants lighting the way with torches.
   Other attendants carried a large parasol over Akihito's head, or
unrolled a rush mat before him. Yet another rolled up the mat
behind the emperor after each deliberate step.
   Inside the sanctuary, out of view of the 733 Japanese guests
seated in large tents nearby, the offerings were to be made to an
altar placed beside a stylized bed, from which the goddess is
summoned.
   Scholars before World War II theorized that at one time the
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex
with the sun goddess, representing a union with the divine. Palace
officials, however, deny that theory and said the emperor would not
touch the bed.
   After the first communion this evening, the ceremony was to be
repeated after midnight in an identical hall located just yards
away from the first one. Haunting court music was to be played
throughout.
   Akihito, like his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, performs
dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace each year, carrying on
the priest-king role that has been handed down from ancient times.
   That role, however, has periodically come under fire since the
end of World War II, and opposition political parties, Christian
organizations and other groups claim the government is violation
the constitutional separation of church and state by spending an
estimated $17 million on the coronation rites.
   Hirohito, who died in January 1989 at age 87, renounced the
concept of imperial divinity on New Year's Day 1946, at the urging
of the U.S.-led occupation forces. The country's post-war
constitution specifies that the emperor is a national symbol, and
not a god-king as tradition had had it.
   Critics say repeating the Shinto rites for Akihito's
enthronement could encourage a return to the feverish
emperor-worship that helped lead the nation into war.
