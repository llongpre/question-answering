   In a solemn, centuries-old rite at the Imperial
Palace, Emperor Akihito acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne on
Monday, becoming the first Japanese monarch enthroned as a symbol
and not a living god.
   Leftist radicals launched 25 separate attacks aimed at
disrupting the ceremony, police said. They fired missiles at five
military bases, including a U.S. naval base, and set fires at
religious shrines and train stations. None of the attacks caused
injuries.
   A massive national security operation involving thousands of
police was mounted to protect the ceremony and the scores of
visiting dignitaries.
   Akihito, wearing a red-brown silk kimono of ancient design, sat
on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an Imperial Palace
courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords.
   He vowed to uphold Japan's modern constitution, which
fundamentally restructures the world's oldest hereditary monarchy.
   ``On this occasion, I pledge anew that I shall observe the
constitution of Japan and discharge my duties as symbol of the
state and of the unity of the people,'' Akihito, speaking in
colloquial Japanese, told about 2,500 guests in the heavily guarded
palace.
   Seated on her own throne at Akihito's side was Empress Michiko,
also dressed in full imperial regalia.
   Under the cloudless skies, gong and drum attendants played
haunting court music for royal family, officials and guests.
Dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony included Vice
President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles and Princess
Diana.
   The ceremony ended with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, dressed in
swallowtail coat, leading the Japanese guests in three cries of
``banzai!'' - a wish for long life. He led the cheers from a spot
level with the throne to underscore the constitution's emphasis on
popular sovereignty.
   Following the enthronement, Akihito and Empress Michiko were to
change into Western clothes and travel in an open car from the
Imperial Palace to the Akasaka Palace, three miles away. Officials
said nearly 10,000 police would line the route, which passes in
front of Japan's parliament.
   Akihito had begun his morning rituals by offering private
prayers at three wooden shrines inside the Imperial Palace to
announce his enthronement to the Sun Goddess and ancestors.
   Critics say the 30-minute ceremony - and a series of
accompanying rites to be held in coming weeks - are based too
closely on the traditional religious rituals used for Akihito's
father and grandfather, who were enthroned as divinities.
   Japan's postwar constitution stipulates that the emperor is
simply a national symbol.
   In one controversial element of the rite, Akihito's raised dais
is said to be patterned after one used by the sun goddess, from
whom tradition says the Japanese imperial line is descended.
Critics say that is an implied symbol of divinity.
   The government is reportedly spending $95 million on the rites,
much of it for security. Opponents say state funding of the
ceremonies, linked to Japan's indigenous Shinto religion, violates
the constitutional separation of religion and state.
   The radical left has been particularly incensed because of the
legacy of imperial militarism in Japan.
   The projectiles were launched at three suburban bases of the
military and at a base in western Tokyo, police said. No damage was
reported.
   Another missile was fired outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi,
24 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Three train fires stopped service on two commuter lines, and in
separate incidents, two major subway lines were shut down because
of smoke.
   Among the other attacks police listed were fires that broke out
at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including one less than a mile
from Akihito's residence. Two shrines were destroyed.
   The attacks, including 19 in Tokyo, caused little other damage,
police said.
   On Sunday, two bombs exploded at the house of U.S. Consul
General Gregory L. Johnson in Nishinomiya, in western Japan. Police
said they caused little damage and no injuries. It was not
immediately clear whether the explosions were connected with the
enthronement.
   A record 37,000 police, including reinforcements from a majority
of Japan's 47 prefectures, have been mobilized for security
surrounding the rite. Security was particularly heavy around the
downtown palace.
   The government has not released the names of Japanese
dignitaries invited to the ceremony, because of fear of radical
attacks on their homes or businesses.
   Traffic was sharply restricted or halted along highways and in
areas around the palace, but few tie-ups were reported, in part
because enthronement day was declared a national holiday and many
Tokyoites took advantage of the three-day weekend to leave town.
Airlines reported many flights were booked close to capacity.
   Akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father,
Emperor Hirohito, in January 1989, but a period of mourning was
observed before his formal enthronement.
   Akihito, 56, was tutored after World War II by an American
pacifist, and is the first emperor in modern Japanese history to
marry a commoner. He and the empress also raised their three
children themselves, rather than have them raised separately by
aides, as was the imperial custom.
   As with Hirohito's funeral, which was attended by
representatives of 164 nations, the enthronement provided
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings. Kaifu was
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials.
   On Monday evening, the first of seven banquets scheduled over
five days is to be held at the Imperial Palace, with senior
Japanese officials and foreign dignitaries attending.
