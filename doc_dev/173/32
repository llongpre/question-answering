   Former President Reagan had lunch with Emperor
Akihito today and received one of Japan's top honors _ the Grand
Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum _ for promoting
free trade and friendship with Japan.
   The award ceremony and luncheon at the Imperial Palace in
central Tokyo was the first meeting between the two men since
Akihito succeeded his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, in January
and since Reagan retired to California.
   ``I am humbled and deeply honored to have been awarded,'' Reagan
said.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko looked on as palace Grand Master of
Ceremonies Kiyoshi Sumiya presented the award to Reagan, palace
officials said. Nancy Reagan, Crown Prince Naruhito and Ambassador
Michael Armacost also attended the ceremony and luncheon, they said
on condition of anonymity.
   The Reagans last met the imperial couple in October 1987 when
they made an official visit to the United States.
   Reagan received the award from the Japanese government for
promoting peace and friendship with Japan and for working to
protect the free trade system during his eight years in office,
officials said. The last and only other U.S. president to receive
the honor was Dwight Eisenhower.
   Later in the day, Reagan, who is in Japan at the invitation of
Fujisankei Communications Group and the Japanese government, met
with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and attended a dinner held by
Kaifu in his honor.
   At the dinner, Kaifu admired Reagan's popularity, noted the
deepening of bilateral relations during his years in office and
warmly congratulated Reagan on his award.
   ``I know that over the years, every relationship has its ups and
downs. Even among the best of friends, there are sometimes issues
which need careful and candid evaluation,'' Reagan said, alluding
to often rocky trade issues.
   Reagan and Fujisankei have refused to confirm reports he will
receive about $2 million for his appearances on television and at
charitable events during his Oct. 20-28 stay.
   Fujisankei, Japan's largest media group, has said it was
spending $7 million on the visit. On Sunday, the group sponsored a
gala benefit concert for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
attended by over 10,000 people.
   Like its chairman, Nobutaka Shikanai, many of Fujisankei's media
outlets espouse conservatism and nationalism.
   At the time of Hirohito's death on Jan. 7, the Fuji TV network
generally carried less critical views of Japan's imperial system.
