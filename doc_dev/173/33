   Emperor Akihito and his mother, the empress
dowager, will be the only heirs of the late Emperor Hirohito in
order to keep together the royal treasures, news reports said today.
   Kyodo News Service said the Imperial Household Agency asked nine
other imperial successors to waive their rights of inheritance.
   The palace declined comment, however, saying a public
announcement now would be premature.
   Hirohito, Japan's emperor for 62 years, died Jan. 7 at age 87.
Akihito, his eldest son, succeeded him and Hirohito's wife, Nagako,
became empress dowager.
   Under Japanese law, legal heirs to property must claim their
inheritance within six months of the owner's death. This would mean
by July 7 in Hirohito's case, and the tax administration office
must announce the claims within four months.
   It will be the first public accounting of the imperial family's
private finances since shortly after World War II. The government
reported then that the imperial family's wealth amounted to the
equivalent of about $113,000.
   Such things as three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and
jewels handed down from emperor to emperor _ are tax-exempt, and
the family owns no land. But bank savings, stocks and bonds under
Hirohito's name and paintings are subject to inheritance taxes.
   Kyodo said the palace will donate the art works to the
government and continue to use them as government-owned imperial
property. The land where the imperial family lives is owned by the
government.
   The imperial family, formerly exempt from taxes, was the
wealthiest family in Japan until U.S. forces occupying this country
after the war forced it to give up most of its property. Its
wealth, including real estate, stocks and bonds, reportedly
amounted to about $29 million before it surrendered most of its
holdings to the government.
