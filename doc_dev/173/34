  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Benin President Nicephore 
Soglo chatted with Emperor Akihito on Tuesday [22 February] at 
the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo, officials said. 
  Following an audience with Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko, Soglo attended a court luncheon hosted by the emperor, 
Imperial Household Agency officials said. 
  The empress, who has suffered speech difficulties since last 
October, did not attend the lunch. Crown Prince Naruhito and 
his wife Princess Masako were in attendance. 
  Soglo arrived in Japan on Monday for a four-day visit to 
seek 
Japanese political and economic support for his nation. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told Soglo on Monday that 
Japan will give the African republic 1.11 billion yen in 
economic assistance. 
  Benin, a small country in west Africa bordering Nigeria, is 
a 
former French colony that became independent in 1960. It was 
renamed from Dahomey in 1975.
