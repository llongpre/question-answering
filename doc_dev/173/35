   Emperor Akihito formally assumed the Chrysanthemum
Throne on Monday in rites steeped in ancient tradition but
reflecting the U.S.-imposed postwar constitution that denies him
the divine status of his predecessors.
   Despite massive security precautions, leftist extremists opposed
to the monarchy launched attacks on military bases, train stations
and Shinto shrines as the late Emperor Hirohito's son assumed the
throne, which is said to date from 660 B.C.
   Police counted more than 32 guerrilla incidents Monday morning,
most in Tokyo. None of the attacks appeared to cause injuries, but
they disrupted several train lines, and a bomb exploded near a
police dormitory, setting two empty houses on fire, police said.
   Akihito, wearing a red-brown silk kimono of ancient design, sat
on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an Imperial Palace
courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords.
   He vowed to uphold Japan's modern constitution, which
fundamentally restructures the world's oldest hereditary monarchy.
   ``On this occasion, I pledge anew that I shall observe the
constitution of Japan and discharge my duties as symbol of the
state and of the unity of the people,'' Akihito, speaking in
colloquial Japanese, told about 2,500 guests in the heavily guarded
palace.
   Seated on her own throne at Akihito's side was Empress Michiko,
also dressed in full imperial regalia.
   Under the cloudless skies, gong and drum attendants played
haunting court music for royal family, officials and guests.
Dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony included Vice
President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles and Princess
Diana.
   Akihito expressed deep ``love and respect'' for his father, who
died in January 1989 after a 62-year reign that encompassed Japan's
crushing defeat in World War II and spectacular rise as the world's
No. 2 economic power.
   Hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war. Under
the new constitution, Akihito becomes the first of Japan's 125
emperors, including those listed only in legend, to take the throne
as a mere mortal and not a priest-king.
   The ceremony ended with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, wearing a
morning suit instead of traditional garb, leading the Japanese
guests in three cries of ``banzai!'' - a wish for long life.
   He led the cheers from a spot level with the throne to
underscore the constitution's emphasis on popular sovereignty.
   Earlier Monday, Akihito had announced his ascension to the sun
goddess and his ancestors in private prayers at wooden shrines
inside the palace.
   A blimp floated overhead with a huge sign urging Tokyo residents
to call with any information about suspected terrorist activity.
   Following the enthronement, Akihito and Empress Michiko were to
change into Western clothes and travel in an open car to the
Akasaka Palace, three miles away. Officials said nearly 10,000
police would line the route, which passes in front of Japan's
parliament.
   But many Japanese were ignoring the ceremonies, taking advantage
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses
and driving ranges. One poll indicated nearly half of the Japanese
were not interested in the enthronement.
   A record 37,000 police, many dressed in full riot gear and
backed by water cannon, were deployed in Tokyo to guard the
ceremonies but could not stop a series of attacks throughout the
city.
   Radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases
and a fourth in western Tokyo, the Defense Agency reported. Police
reported a similar attack outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi, 25
miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at
three Tokyo train stations that stopped traffic on two major
commuter lines, police reported.
   Fires erupted at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including one
less than a mile from Akihito's residence, destroying two.
   Radicals and other critics say the coronation and its
accompanying rites are based too closely on the traditional
religious rituals used for Akihito's father, whose name was invoked
by the militarists who launched the Pacific War.
   Opponents say state funding of the ceremonies, linked to Japan's
indigenous Shinto religion, violates the constitutional separation
of religion and state.
   Akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father,
but a period of mourning was observed before his enthronement.
   As with Hirohito's funeral, which was attended by
representatives of 164 nations, the enthronement provided
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings. Kaifu was
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials.
   The government is reportedly spending $95 million on the rites,
much of it for security.
   Akihito, 56, was tutored after World War II by an American
pacifist, and is the first emperor in modern Japanese history to
marry a commoner.
   He and the empress also raised their three children themselves,
rather than have them raised separately by aides, as was the
imperial custom.
