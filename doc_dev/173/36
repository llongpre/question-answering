   Emperor Akihito ascended to the world's oldest
hereditary monarchy today, the first in a legendary 2,600-year-old
line of emperors to be enthroned as a national symbol rather than a
living god.
   Leftist extremists, who consider the institution of emperor an
unconstitutional relic of Japan's militarist past, attacked
military bases, train stations and Shinto shrines in protest.
   Police counted at least 34 guerrilla attacks timed to coincide
with the coronation of the late Emperor Hirohito's 56-year-old son.
None appeared to cause any injuries.
   A record 37,000 police had been mobilized to guard the
ceremonies as well as the attending dignitaries from 158 countries,
including Vice President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles
and Princess Diana.
   For his coronation, Akihito wore a red-brown silk kimono and hat
of ancient design and sat on an elaborate lacquered throne in front
of an Imperial Palace courtyard filled with attendants carrying
bows and swords.
   He vowed to ``discharge my duties as symbol of the state and of
the unity of the people'' under Japan's postwar constitution, which
fundamentally restructured the monarchy.
   Hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war, but
Akihito becomes the first of Japan's 125 emperors, including those
listed only in legend, to take the throne as a mere mortal and not
a priest-king.
   He said he would perform his role in the same spirit as his
father, who ``shared joys and sorrows with the people at all
times'' during a 62-year reign that encompassed both the
devastation of World War II and Japan's dramatic recovery.
   Empress Michiko, dressed in a multicolored gown, her face
painted white, sat motionless on her own throne at Akihito's side
throughout the 30-minute ceremony.
   The ritual ended with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu standing
stiffly before Akihito in a morning suit and leading the Japanese
guests in three cries of ``Banzai'' - he traditional wish for long
life.
   He led the cheers from a point level with the base of the
throne, to underscore the constitution's stress on popular
sovereignty.
   A 21-gun salute blasted from an adjacent park.
   The ancient, mystical enthronement rites are said to date back
to 660 B.C.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko later left the palace grounds in an
open Rolls Royce, ringed by dozens of police motorcycles and waving
and smiling to cheering crowds. They had changed to formal Western
clothes.
   Many of the estimated 110,000 people along the three-mile parade
route to Akasaka Palace, the couple's home, yelled ``Banzai'' and
waved national flags as the 44-car parade passed. Nearly 10,000
police lined the route.
   There was one shaky moment, however, when firecrackers popped as
the emperor's car passed by. Police with German shepherds rushed in
and arrested several people, some of whom handed out leaflets
calling Hirohito a war criminal.
   Leftist radicals who want the imperial house abolished made
themselves heard all across the capital. Police said they arrested
about a dozen of the several thousand protesters who held
anti-imperial rallies around Tokyo.
   In one park, hundreds of masked members of the ultra-leftist
Chukakuha, or Middle Core Faction, chanted ``Smash the enthronement
ceremony!''
   One man attempted to commit hara-kiri, or traditional suicide by
disembowelment, in front of the Imperial Palace but was rushed to a
hospital, police said. There were no immediate details on his
condition or motivation.
   Radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases
and a fourth in western Tokyo, the Defense Agency reported. Police
reported another attack outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi, 24
miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at
three Tokyo train stations that stopped traffic on two major
commuter lines, police reported.
   Fires erupted at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including one
less than a mile from Akihito's residence, destroying two.
   Japanese flags lined the main streets in the Ginza shopping
district, where cars and trucks painted with rightist slogans
paraded. Speakers blared ``Long live the emperor,'' as riot police
stood by.
   But many Japanese were ignoring the ceremonies, taking advantage
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses
and driving ranges. Long lines of people queued in front of movie
theaters.
   One poll indicated nearly half of the Japanese were not
interested in the enthronement.
   Akihito became emperor immediately after the death of Hirohito
in January 1989, but his enthronement was delayed until after a
period of mourning.
