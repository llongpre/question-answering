<HEAD>President Roh Seeks Trip to Japan Despite Diplomatic Row</HEAD>

   President Roh Tae-woo will push ahead
with his scheduled visit to Japan, his office said today, despite
an escalating diplomatic row over Japan's apology for its colonial
rule of Korea.
   South Korea, however, may develop some retaliatory measures if
Japan rejects its demand for a clear-cut apology for wrongs
committed under Japan's 1910-45 rule, presidential spokesman Lee
Soo-jung said. He did not elaborate.
   Roh has been under public pressure to call off his trip next
week to Tokyo, following controversial remarks by Japanese
governing party leaders asking Japanese Emperor Akihito not to make
an open, strong apology. But Lee said the president would not
reconsider the three-day visit, beginning May 24.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Tuesday he plans to
apologize to Roh about the colonial rule but would not say whether
the emperor should.
   Elderly Koreans have staged daily protests outside the Japanese
Embassy to demand an apology and compensation for Japan's wartime
acts. The protesters, many related to Koreans who were killed
during World War II, have asked Roh to cancel his visit. During the
war, Japan drafted hundreds of thousands of Koreans as soldiers and
forced laborers.
   ``Japan, the war criminal, must apologize, compensate,'' a dozen
protesters shouted today during a sit-in outside the embassy, which
was guarded by riot troopers wearing helmets and carrying shields.
Police did not intervene.
   The matter is delicate for the Japanese, touching on the nature
of the emperor's role under the postwar constitution and recalling
unresolved questions about how much responsibility the late Emperor
Hirohito had for Japan's wartime actions.
   Akihito succeeded to the throne after Hirohito died in January
1989.
   Roh's trip had been delayed twice by issues involving the legal
status of some 700,000 ethnic Koreans living in Japan. Japan agreed
early this month to provide greater legal protection for Koreans.
