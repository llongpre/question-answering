   In Japan's clearest effort to grapple with its
militaristic past, Emperor Akihito and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
on Thursday acknowledged the suffering that Japanese colonial rule
inflicted on Koreans.
   The apology come 45 years after a defeated Japan relinquished
its control of the Korean peninsula. The issue of acknowledging
Japan's past exposed bitter memories in both countries, prompting
demonstrations and arson attacks.
   In a palace banquet for visiting South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo, Akihito went beyond a previous imperial statement and said
he felt the ``deepest regret'' for the pain Japan's colonial rule
caused the Korean people. Earlier Thursday, Kaifu expressed
``sincere remorse and honest apologies'' for Japanese actions that
``inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the
Korean peninsula.''
   Kaifu's apology was the most clear-cut ever by a Japanese prime
minister, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said. A similar
statement of remorse also was expected to be made by Parliament,
where Roh was to give an address Friday.
   For Japan, which normalized relations with South Korea in 1965,
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering
it inflicted during its 1910-1945 rule of Korea. The lack of an
explicit apology had been a major obstacle to improving the two
neighbors' relations.
   Roh, replying to Akihito, said the ``dark period'' in
Japanese-Korean relations had been short and it was time to put
``the unfortunate past truly behind us.''
   In South Korea, thousands of radical students burned Japanese
flags and fought with police Thursday. They shouted slogans that
Roh's trip to Japan _ only the second by a South Korean head of
state _ was a ``sellout to national pride.''
   Under colonial rule, Koreans had to study Japanese in school and
were taught to worship the Japanese emperor. Koreans were drafted
into the Japanese army and into forced labor in Japan. Hundreds of
thousands died in wartime service to Japan.
   Little of this is known in Japan, and the history is skimmed
over in schools. Lately, however, Japanese media have given crash
courses in Japan-Korea history with graphic photos and films of
Japanese atrocities.
   Before the trip, Kaifu had offered to make a strong statement,
but South Koreans sought a personal apology from Akihito because
Japan's military adventures in the early part of this century often
were made in the name of his father, the late Emperor Hirohito.
   The demands sparked a debate within Japan's government over
whether a strong apology by the emperor would violate
constitutional restraints on his political role.
   In a carefully orchestrated compromise, both governments seemed
to hope that whatever was lacking in the Akihito statement would be
made up for by Kaifu and the Parliament.
   Akihito quoted the words Hirohito used in 1984 during the state
visit of Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan: ``It is indeed
regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us for a
period in this century, and I believe it should not be repeated
again.''
   That statement, the closest Hirohito ever came to a public
apology, was strongly criticized in South Korea as being too vague
and for not saying who was to blame.
   But Akihito went on to say: ``I think of the sufferings your
people underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought
about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret.''
   Underscoring the importance of Roh's visit, the 150-guest
banquet was the largest at the palace since Akihito assumed the
throne after his father's death. Akihito broke with tradition by
welcoming Roh outside the banquet hall. As they entered the hall,
musicians played ``Hand in Hand,'' theme song of the 1988 Seoul
Olympics.
   Foreign Minister Choi Ho-jung, who accompanied Roh to Tokyo,
indicated that Japan's apology fell short of Seoul's expectations
but said he believed Japan did ``its best to receive President Roh
with courtesy.''
   Extreme leftists vowed to disrupt the visit, which they call the
first step toward reviving the militarist Japanese empire.
Rightists, who worship the emperor, have strongly opposed calls for
Akihito to apologize.
   Police mobilized 20,000 officers to guard against radical
attacks. Though they said about 300 leftist radicals demonstrated
in two separate Tokyo rallies, no arrests or incidents were
reported.
