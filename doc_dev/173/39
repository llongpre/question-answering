  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam on Thursday [24 March] officially invited Emperor 
Akihito and Empress Michiko to visit South Korea to forge a new 
future-oriented relationship, the Imperial Household Agency 
said. "I would like to promote relations between South Korea 
and Japan from a forward-looking, future-oriented view," a 
senior Imperial Palace official quoted Kim as saying. 
  Bilateral relations are still overshadowed by Japan's 
colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, and 
anti-Japanese sentiment continues to run high. 
  Kim and his wife, Son Myong-sun, had a 25-minute audience 
with the imperial couple in an "overall pleasant atmosphere," 
Kiyoshi Sumiya, grand master of ceremonies, said. 
  "I think it would benefit our friendly neighborly relations 
if we could welcome the emperor and the empress in South Korea. 
I would like to seize this good opportunity to offer an 
invitation," Kim told the imperial couple. 
  The emperor replied it is the Japanese Government's decision 
on whether he goes abroad. 
  In an interview ahead of the visit, Kim, who was elected 
last 
year to a single five-year term, said he believes he will be 
able to receive the emperor in Seoul during his term in office. 
  The emperor told Kim it is important that both nations 
deepen 
their exchange while reflecting on history and respecting each 
other's cultures. 
  During colonization, Koreans were forbidden from speaking 
Korean in public and had to adopt Japanese names. In addition, 
Japan's forced recruitment of tens of thousands of Korean women 
for wartime military brothels has refueled bitter memories.
