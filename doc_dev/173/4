  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Japan's Emperor 
Akihito will pay a visit to the United States this year, Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Friday [11 February]. 
  Hosokawa told President Bill Clinton of the emperor's 
intention to make the trip during their summit meeting Friday, 
Japanese officials said. 
  Clinton expressed his pleasure at the visit and said the 
U.S. 
Government will do everything it can to make the emperor feel 
welcome, a Japanese spokesman said. 
  Hosokawa did not say when the Japanese monarch is expected 
to 
make the trip, but government sources in Tokyo have said it is 
likely to be in June. 
  Empress Michiko is expected to accompany the emperor. It 
will be the first visit by a Japanese emperor to the U.S. since 
the late Emperor Hirohito, posthumously called Emperor Showa, 
went there in September 1975.
