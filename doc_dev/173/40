Former President Ronald Reagan had lunch with Emperor Akihito today and 
received one of Japan's top honors -- the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of 
the Chrysanthemum -- for promoting free trade and friendship with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The award ceremony and luncheon at the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo was the 
first meeting between the two men since Akihito succeeded his father, the late 
Emperor Hirohito, in January and since Reagan retired to California. 
</P>
<P>
"I am humbled and deeply honored to have been awarded," said Reagan, who is 
earning $2 million in speaking fees during his visit. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito and Empress Michiko looked on as palace Grand Master of Ceremonies 
Kiyoshi Sumiya presented the award to Reagan, palace officials said. Nancy 
Reagan, Crown Prince Naruhito and Ambassador Michael Armacost also attended the 
ceremony and luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans last met the imperial couple in October, 1987, when they made an 
official visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan received the award from the Japanese government for promoting peace and 
friendship with Japan and for working to protect the free trade system during 
his eight years in office, officials said. The last and only other U.S. 
President to receive the honor was Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Reagan, who is in Japan at the invitation of Fujisankei 
Communications Group and the Japanese government, met with Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu and attended a dinner held by Kaifu in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
At the dinner, Kaifu admired Reagan's popularity, noted the deepening of 
bilateral relations during his years in office and warmly congratulated Reagan 
on his award. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that over the years, every relationship has its ups and downs. Even 
among the best of friends, there are sometimes issues which need careful and 
candid evaluation," Reagan said, alluding to often rocky trade issues.
