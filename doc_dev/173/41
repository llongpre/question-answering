  [Text] Paris, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and French President Francois Mitterrand agreed 
Wednesday [4 May] that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
program threatens the global move toward preventing the spread 
of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear powers. 
  The two leaders shared the understanding during a two-hour 
meeting at the French Presidential Palace, Japanese officials 
said. 
  The meeting took place after Hata arrived in Paris from Rome 
as part of his European tour, which will also take him to 
Germany and Belgium. 
  They said Hata told Mitterrand that the North Korean nuclear 
issue "is a serious problem that threatens the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime, as well as undermines the security of 
the Asia-Pacific region." 
  Hata also said, "we must counter the threat in solidarity, 
while keeping the channels for (diplomatic) dialogue open." 
  Mitterrand agreed with Hata's view, the Japanese officials 
said. 
  On China, Hata told Mitterrand, "it is important for China 
to 
provide greater transparency in its activities in the military 
field...and it is crucial for us to urge China to demonstrate a 
positive response in the field of human rights." 
  Hata also told Mitterrand, "Japan wants to step up its 
cooperation with France in various fields from now on" to build 
a new international order to secure global peace in addition to 
strengthening the capabilities of the United Nations, the 
officials said. 
  Mitterrand replied, "I agree with your view. The two nations 
can build up a stronger relationship of cooperation." 
  The French president expressed his interest in enhancing 
cooperation, particularly in extending economic assistance to 
such areas as Indochina and Africa. 
  Hata expressed gratitude for France's endorsement for 
Japan's 
bid to secure a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, of 
which France is one of the five permanent members. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed his support 
for 
Japan's bid for permanent membership on the UN decision-making 
body during his visit to Tokyo in March. 
  Mitterrand, however, stopped short of addressing the issue, 
according to the Japanese officials. 
  The French leader expressed his nation's readiness to 
welcome 
Japanese Emperor Akihito and his wife Michiko, who are slated to 
visit France in October. 
  "We are looking forward to meeting the emperor and empress," 
the president was quoted as saying. 
  Hata replied, "the emperor is also looking forward to the 
visit." The royal couple is slated to visit France and Spain on 
a two-week trip that will begin in late September.
