   President Roh Tae-woo said Saturday
that Japan's apologies for its brutal colonial rule might not
satisfy all South Koreans, but he urged them to look to the future,
not the past.
   Roh returned from an emotional three-day visit to Japan aimed at
beginning a new partnership between the Asian neighbors. At its
conclusion, he invited Emperor Akihito to make the first Japanese
imperial visit to South Korea.
   During Roh's visit, Akihito expressed ``deepest regret for the
sufferings and pain'' Japan inflicted on Korea during its colonial
rule from 1910 to 1945. Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
extended his ``sincere remorse and honest apologies.''
   Kaifu's apology was Japan's clearest statement of regret ever
over its military past. But Roh acknowledged many South Koreans
would be dissatisfied with it.
   ``I well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have
about what went on between our country and Japan in the past. No
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory,'' Roh said at a news
conference at Seoul's airport.
   During much of the colonial period, Koreans were forced to speak
Japanese, use Japanese names and worship the late Japanese Emperor
Hirohito, Akihito's father. Many Koreans died after being
conscripted into Japan's army or in dangerous jobs as laborers in
Japan.
   Before leaving Tokyo on Saturday, Roh said Akihito's words of
regret ``were very significant,'' and said the emperor and Kaifu
had ``expressed a common awareness about this unfortunate period
between our two countries.''
   ``With this, I feel that myself and the people of my country
feel we can put the unfortunate period of our history behind us,''
Roh said.
   In Tokyo, about 20,000 police had been mobilized to guard
against threats to Roh from both rightist and leftist groups, but
no incidents were reported.
   During a brief visit to Osaka in western Japan on his way home,
about 30 leftists demonstrated peacefully against Roh's visit,
police said.
   Roh's visit had sparked far bigger protests in South Korea.
Before he left for Japan, radicals and human rights groups
demonstrated almost daily, demanding that he cancel his visit.
   One man slashed his belly with a knife in front of the Japanese
Embassy in Seoul in protest.
   Roh said after his return that he believed Kaifu's and Akihito's
statements of regret were sufficient and urged that they be
accepted.
   ``Even if we may feel that the Japanese apologies do not fully
live up to our expectations, we should accept them with magnanimity
and generosity now that Japan has forthrightly admitted its
mistakes, reflected on them and apologized,'' he said.
   ``With that, I believe we must now forge a new era of
neighborliness and friendship,'' he added.
   Some sore points remain unresolved, including discrimination
against Korean residents in Japan and health care for Korean
survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Roh made clear that he had asked Japan to move forward on those
issues, but he said he was satisfied with the progress so far.
   ``If we are to promote the peace and prosperity of northeast
Asia and also usher in an Asian-Pacific age by the 21st century, we
should advance friendly cooperation with Japan, our next-door
neighbor,'' he said.
