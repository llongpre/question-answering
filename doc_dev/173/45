   Emperor Hirohito, who held divine status until
Japan's defeat in World War II and endured to reign for 62 years,
died Saturday, the government's chief spokesman announced. He was 87.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Kenzo Obuchi said the emperor died at
6:33 a.m. (4:03 a.m. EST Friday).
   The frail monarch had been in deteriorating health since Sept.
19, when he vomited blood, and had received numerous blood
transfusions since then to counteract internal hemorrhaging.
   The palace said the emperor died of intestinal cancer.
   Kyodo News Service said Crown Prince Akihito, 55, the emperor's
oldest son, immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   It said Akihito was taking over three sacred imperial treasures
that symbolize the throne and have been handed down through
generations of emperors.
