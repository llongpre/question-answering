   In a solemn, centuries-old rite at the Imperial
Palace, Emperor Akihito formally accedes to the Chrysanthemum
Throne on Monday, becoming the first Japanese monarch enthroned as
a symbol and not a living god.
   Leftist radicals launched a series of attacks aimed at
disrupting the ceremony. They fired missiles at five military
bases, including a U.S. naval base, and were blamed with setting
fires at religious shrines and train stations. None of the attacks
caused injuries.
   A massive national security operation involving thousands of
police was mounted to protect the ceremony and the scores of
visiting dignitaries.
   Clad in ancient court costume, seated atop an elaborate
lacquered platform under a curtained canopy encrusted with gold
phoenixes and circular mirrors, Akihito will face a courtyard lined
with ceremonial banners.
   Next to him on a smaller platform will be Empress Michiko. Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu will lead the 2,500 guests in three cheers
of ``Banzai!'' - ``May you live ten thousand years!''
   Akihito began his morning rituals by offering private prayers at
three wooden shrines inside the heavily guarded Imperial Palace to
announce his enthronement to the Sun Goddess and ancestors.
   Critics say the 30-minute ceremony - and a series of
accompanying rites to be held in coming weeks - are based too
closely on the traditional religious rituals used for Akihito's
father and grandfather, who were enthroned as living gods.
   Under Japan's postwar constitution, the emperor is simply a
national symbol.
   In one controversial element of the rite, Akihito's raised dais
is said to be patterned after one used by the sun goddess, from
whom tradition says the Japanese imperial line is descended.
Critics say that is an implied symbol of divinity.
   The government is reportedly spending $95 million on the rites,
much of it for security. Opponents say state funding of the
ceremonies, linked to Japan's indigenous Shinto religion, violates
the constitutional separation of religion and state.
   The radical left has been particularly incensed because of the
legacy of imperial militarism in Japan.
   The projectiles were launched at three suburban bases of the
military and at a base in western Tokyo, police said. No damage was
reported.
   Another missile was fired outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi,
24 miles southwest of Tokyo. The base was apparently the target of
that failed attack.
   Three train fires stopped service on two commuter lines, and in
separate incidents, two major subway lines were shut down because
of smoke.
   Fires also broke out at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including
one less than a mile from Akihito's residence. Police said all were
believed started by extremists.
   No injuries were immediately reported, but tw shrines were
destroyed.
   On Sunday, two bombs exploded at the house of U.S. Consul
General Gregory L. Johnson in Nishinomiya, in western Japan. Police
said they caused little damage and no injuries. It was not
immediately clear whether the explosions were connected with the
enthronement.
   A record 37,000 police, including reinforcements from a majority
of Japan's 47 prefectures, have been mobilized for security
surrounding the rite. Security was particularly heavy around the
downtown palace, where Akihito began his morning rituals by
offering private prayers to the sun goddess at a wooden shrine.
   Dignitaries from 158 countries expected to attend the ceremony
include Vice President Dan Quayle, United Nations Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly I.
Lukyanov and Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana.
   The government has not released the names of Japanese
dignitaries invited to the ceremony, because of fear of radical
attacks on their homes or businesses.
   Traffic was sharply restricted or halted along highways and in
areas around the palace, but few tie-ups were reported, in part
because enthronement day was declared a national holiday and many
Tokyoites took advantage of the three-day weekend to leave town.
Airlines reported many flights were booked close to capacity.
   Akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father,
Emperor Hirohito, in January 1989, but a period of mourning was
observed before his formal enthronement.
   Akihito, 56, was tutored after World War II by an American
pacifist, and is the first emperor in modern Japanese history to
marry a commoner. He and the empress also raised their three
children themselves, rather than have them raised separately by
aides, as was the imperial custom.
   As with Hirohito's funeral, which was attended by
representatives of 164 nations, the enthronement provided
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings. Kaifu was
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials.
   On Monday evening, the first of seven banquets scheduled over
five days is to be held at the Imperial Palace, with senior
Japanese officials and foreign dignitaries attending.
