   Kiko Kawashima is a college student living in a
small apartment with her parents, but come Friday, Japan's
modern-day Cinderella will call a palace her home.
   In Japan's first royal wedding in six years, the 23-year-old
Miss Kawashima is to wed Emperor Akihito's youngest son, Prince
Aya, who is 24 and second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   The wedding will be lavish _ the government has allotted nearly
$1 million _ and filled with traditions dating back more than 1,000
years.
   But to a nation that only last year buried Emperor Hirohito,
whose 62-year reign spanned a turbulent period of militarist
expansionism and economic reconstruction, the wedding also is being
hailed as the first taste of a new era.
   As far as the clearly smitten Japanese media are concerned,
Prince Aya could not have chosen a better mate than ``Kiko-san,''
who is only the second commoner to marry into the imperial family.
   Aya's mother, Empress Michiko, became the first in 1959 when she
married Emperor Akihito, who was then crown prince. Akihito
ascended the throne immediately after Hirohito's death on Jan. 7,
1989.
   Most of Japan's major television networks will broadcast live
coverage of the ceremony and related events. The wedding is
scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and will be followed by several other
ceremonies, so television coverage will likely last well into the
night.
   Along with the countless comparisons to Cinderella, Miss
Kawashima has been dubbed the ``Apartment Princess'' because of her
relatively humble abode _ faculty housing on the campus of Tokyo's
Gakushuin University.
   At Gakushuin, Miss Kawashima is working on her master's degree
in psychology. Her father, Tatsuhiko, teaches economics there.
   The former peer's school boasts much of the imperial family and
former nobility among its alumni. It is where Miss Kawashima and
her prince met in 1985, when he too was a Gakushuin student.
   Since the engagement of Aya and Miss Kawashima was formally
announced in September, flocks of reporters often have staked out
the Kawashimas' three-bedroom apartment.
   They have tagged along as Miss Kawashima did her final
pre-wedding shopping, and even as she made a rare appearance at a
bowling alley. Her score was reportedly about 100.
   Though the Japanese and their media generally treat the monarchy
with great deference, photographing Miss Kawashima's mother hanging
the family laundry out to dry is apparently acceptable, as is
broadcasting it to millions of television viewers.
   Aya, who returned Thursday from two years of zoology studies at
England's Oxford University, has managed to avoid most of the media
blitz.
   Palace officials say the somber, 15-minute wedding will begin
with the sound of shrill classical Japanese music. The young
couple, attended by several chamberlains, will slowly walk down a
corridor to a wooden shrine at the Imperial Palace.
   After Aya makes his vows to the sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom
legend says the imperial family descended, the couple will sip rice
wine to seal their marital bond.
   Later in the day, they are to visit Akihito and Michiko to
announce their marriage. In keeping with tradition, the emperor and
empress will not be among the guests invited to the ceremony itself.
   The guest list, however, does include such dignitaries as Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu and the heads of the judicial and
legislative branches of government.
   The emperor is to bestow upon Aya a new title to mark his
marriage and creation of an independent household. Aya's given name
is Fumihito, but Japanese only rarely refer to him by that.
   Following three days of receptions, and three more days to rest,
Aya and Miss Kawashima will travel to the Grand Shrines of Ise, the
central place of worship for believers of Shinto, Japan's
indigenous religion.
   Before returning to Tokyo, where they will pay their respects at
Hirohito's mausoleum, they also will visit the tomb dedicated to
Japan's first emperor, Jimmu, who according to legend began his
reign in 660 B.C.
   Police plan to mobilize 9,000 officers to guard against leftist
attacks, and the public will have little chance to see the royal
couple in person.
   But a short ``parade,'' from the Imperial Palace to the Akasaka
Palace where the emperor and empress reside, is planned.
