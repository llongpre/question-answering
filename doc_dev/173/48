<HEAD>Koreans Mount Daily Protest at Japanese Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>

   South Korean protesters held a sit-in
in front of the Japanese Embassy on Friday for the fifth
consecutive day to demand an apology by Japan's emperor for
colonial rule of Korea.
   Some of their placards asked President Roh Tae-woo to cancel his
three-day visit to Japan next week. Roh has been under mounting
public pressure to put off the visit unless Emperor Akihito makes
such an apology.
   The protesters, relatives of Koreans drafted by Japan and killed
during World War II, were demanding an apology and compensation for
Japan's wartime acts.
   The protest began Monday, when about a dozen people, all more
than 50 years old, sat on the ground about 15 yards from the
embassy's main gate, shouting ``Akihito, apologize!'' About 60 riot
police guarded the embassy, but there have been no arrests.
   The protesters gather in the morning and stay several hours
after nightfall, reading statements and chanting slogans.
   Minor scuffles have broken out only when the protesters
screaming slogans try to run after cars carrying Japanese
diplomats. Some irate protesters hurled eggs on Thursday.
   The late Emperor Hirohito, who died in January 1989, said in
1984 he sincerely regretted that there was an unfortunate past
between the two countries.
   However, South Korean officials have said the apology was
unclear to the Korean people.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan has said he will apologize
to the Korean people next week. But Japanese officials have
resisted calls for Akihito to make a formal apology, saying the
emperor, the symbol of the Japanese state, should not be used for
political purposes.
   Anti-Japanese sentiment is strong among many elderly Koreans who
remember Japan's harsh colonial rule. Following the Russo-Japanese
war, Japan annexed Korea in 1910 and controlled it until the end of
World War II.
   During the war, Japan drafted hundreds of thousands of Koreans
as soldiers and forced laborers.
   In Japan on Friday, authorities reported two suspected arson
attacks linked to Roh's visit.
   Three cars were destroyed in one attack by suspected leftist
extremists at a state police headquarters in Omiya, just north of
Tokyo, police said.
   Local authorities reported a separate fire at housing facilities
for South Korean residents in Nagoya, central Japan, on Thursday
evening.
   No one was reported injured in either incident, and only minor
damage was reported to the building.
   Radical extremist groups that oppose Roh's visit claim it is a
step toward reviving the Japanese empire as it existed earlier in
the century.
