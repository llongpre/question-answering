CZECHOSLOVAK President Vaclav Havel, pictured with Japan's Emperor Akihito,
yesterday asked Japan to help revive the economy in his former communist
country, Reuter reports from Tokyo. In talks with Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, Mr Havel called for increased economic exchanges, including
preferential tariffs, to boost trade. He also appealed for investment to
build up medium and small firms in his country. Mr Miyazawa promised
financing and investment to help privatise Czechoslovak firms. He said Japan
would offer preferential tariffs from next month to boost imports of
Czechoslovak glassware. The two countries are to sign a trade agreement in
Tokyo today.
