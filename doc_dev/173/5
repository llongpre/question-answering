  [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Jeffrey Ku, chairman of 
the Taipei-based Chinatrust Commercial Bank, was granted an 
audience with Japanese Emperor Akihito Wednesday [6 April]. 
  "I feel honored to have met with the Japanese emperor at his 
Tokyo palace," Ku said Thursday upon his return from a five-day 
visit to Japan. 
  Ku, also an unpaid advisor to Taiwan's Executive Yuan, 
stressed that his visit to Japan was private. 
  Ku said Emperor Akihito expressed his goodwill and regard 
for 
Taiwan. "Akihito was interested in Taiwan's current 
developments," he noted. 
  Ku said he briefed the Japanese emperor on Taiwan's economic 
strength and its role in Southeast Asian economic development. 
  "We also exchanged views on the possible impact on Asia of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the prospects for 
the formation of the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus and the 
Asian Free Trade Agreement," Ku said. 
  Ku was the first Taiwan businessman granted a formal 
audience 
with Akihito since the emperor took the throne in October 1989. 
Akihito talked briefly with [passage indistinct]. 
  Political observers said Jeffrey Ku's meeting with Akihito 
would boost the development of substantive ties between Taiwan 
and Japan, even though the Japanese emperor is just a spiritual 
leader and wields no political power. 
  Japan recognizes Beijing and has been reluctant to develop 
any official ties with Taiwan for fear of offending communist 
Chinese leaders. 
  Many countries, including the United States, France and 
Germany, have sent ministerial-level officials to visit Taiwan, 
but Japan has not followed suit.
