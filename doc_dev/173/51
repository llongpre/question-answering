   Japan's new emperor said Monday he will help
safeguard the democratic constitution, and leftist politicians urged
vigilance against any government effort to use the monarchy for
``reactionary'' ends.
   One Communist and five Socialist legislators boycotted the
ceremony at which Emperor Akihito pledged himself to the
constitution imposed by the United States after World War II, but
two Socialists did attend.
   Those who stayed away said the monarchy's close links to the
Shinto religion violates the constitutional separation of state and
religion. They were invited in their capacities as chairmen of
parliamentary committees.
   Outside the imperial palace, nearly 315,000 mourners signed
registers of condolence Monday for Emperor Hirohito, who died of
cancer Saturday at age 87. His 62-year reign was marked by the rise
of militarism, defeat in the war and Japan's emergence as a leading
economic power.
   One mourner outside, 36-year-old pianist Yumiko Ideta, said of
the new imperial era: ``I and many of my generation think it will be
a good chance for Akihito to do the things his father wasn't able to
do. We know that the emperor has been manipulated politically since
Meiji times (1867-1912) and we'll have to address the problem during
Akihito's reign and afterward.''
   Akihito, 55, is expected to be closer to the people than his
father, who was considered a living god until he renounced the
concept of imperial divinity after World War II.
   On Monday, in his first speech as emperor, Akihito said he would
continue on Hirohito's path, ``making his desire to constantly be at
one with the people my desire as well, joining together with you to
preserve the constitution of Japan.''
   He reaffirmed the limits placed on his role by the constitution,
which makes him ``a symbol of the state and the unity of the
people.'' His duties are ceremonial, consisting of signing bills
into law and meeting foreign dignitaries.
   By emphasizing the constitution drawn up in the U.S. occupation
of 1945-52, Akihito was expected to win praise from liberals. They
have criticized recent attempts by rightist members of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to revise the document and declare the
emperor ``head'' of the nation.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita pledged to work within the
``constitution of Japan and with the emperor, the symbol of unity of
the people, to make Japan open to the world.''
   Analysts said optimism about Emperor Akihito's new era helped
boost the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key indicator, the Nikkei Stock
Average of 225 selected issues, up 468.85 points to a record high
30,678.39 on Monday.
   The new emperor spoke somberly for four minutes in the formal
ceremony attended by Takeshita and 237 members of the imperial
family, government, parliament and judiciary.
   ``Shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the awesome
responsibilities I undertake, I stand humbly before you,'' Akihito
said. At his side were Empress Michiko, 54, and their 28-year-old
son, Crown Prince Naruhito.
   Eizo Kobayashi, a senior Communist Party official, told reporters
later: ``No matter what the new emperor says, we must realize the
possible danger of his role. Our task now is to oppose reactionary,
political use of the emperor and to promote the peaceful clauses of
the postwar constitution.''
   Opposition political parties also say government sponsorship of
some of the numerous rites honoring Hirohito, with their Shinto
practices, violates the constitution.
   Hirohito will be buried Feb. 24 in an imperial mausoleum in
Hachioji, a western suburb, after a state funeral in the Shinjuku
Gyoen Imperial Gardens and a public procession.
   In one of about 60 funeral and transition rites, Emperor Akihito
paid final respects to his father Monday and palace officials sealed
Hirohito's body, in a coffin of Japanese cypress, inside a copper
container, news reports said.
   Officials said slightly more than 1 million mourners had visited
the palace in central Tokyo since Saturday to sign the condolence
books, and about 350,000 had signed 11 other registers around the
country.
   Two old soldiers hanged themselves Saturday and Sunday, leaving
suicide notes saying they wanted to follow the emperor in death.
   Teinosuke Watanabe, an 82-year-old retired company president,
said after signing the palace condolence register Monday: ``For my
generation, the emperor was an honorable man. In his own way he has
admitted responsibility for the war ... traveling around the country
to meet the people as they rebuilt.
   ``By living, he has borne the heavy burden of war
responsibility.''
   How much responsibility Hirohito bore has been a matter of
controversy, but historians generally agree he was a figurehead with
too little power to do anything but approve decisions of military
leaders.
