EMPEROR Akihito of Japan last night said he 'deeply deplored' the suffering
caused during the Japanese army's occupation of China, but fell short of
issuing a formal apology.
At a state banquet in his honour in Beijing, however, Emperor Akihito went
further in atoning for Japan's actions than his father Hirohito - the
god-monarch who presided over Japan during the second world war and who
usually expressed his 'regret' about the past on such occasions.
'In the long history of the relationship between our two countries, there
was an unfortunate period in which my country inflicted great sufferings on
the people of China,' Emperor Akihito said. 'I deeply deplore this. When the
war came to an end the Japanese people, believing with a sense of deep
reproach that such a war should never be repeated, resolved to tread the
road of a peaceful nation.'
Although the speech may satisfy the Chinese government - which is keen to
encourage Japanese investment in China - it is moot whether it will satisfy
public opinion.
The Chinese have been schooled, as a matter of government policy, in Japan's
war atrocities in their country. As many as 10m Chinese citizens are
estimated to have been killed during the occupation, which began with the
Manchurian incident in 1931 and ended with Japan's defeat in the Pacific war
in 1945.
Museums have been erected in many parts of the country to glorify the
Communist party's resistance to the Japanese invasion and to emphasise the
brutality of its occupation.
The Chinese government had allowed some citizens to agitate against Japan in
the run-up to Emperor Akihito's visit and has permitted publication of calls
for Japan to pay Dollars 180bn (Pounds 110.4bn) in war reparations, despite
waiving the right to seek them when normalising relations 20 years ago.
