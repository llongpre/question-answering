   Emperor Hirohito, who held divine status until
Japan's defeat in World War II and endured to reign for 62 years,
died Saturday of intestinal cancer. He was 87.
   The government's chief spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kenzo
Obuchi, said the emperor died at 6:33 a.m. (4:33 p.m. EST Friday).
   Shoichi Fujimori, grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency,
told a nationally televised news conference that Hirohito died of
cancer of the upper duodenum.
   The frail monarch, who urged his country to surrender after the
atomic bombing of Japan by the United States in the closing days of
the war, had undergone intestinal bypass surgery in September 1987.
At the time, his doctors said a growth blocking his intestine was
not cancerous.
   On Sept. 19, 1988, the emperor vomited blood and remained in
serious condition after that with internal bleeding, but until the
death announcement, the household agency refused to confirm local
news reports he was suffering from cancer. Japanese custom is not to
let cancer patients know they have the disease.
   Crown Prince Akihito, 55, the emperor's eldest son, immediately
ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne. At a ceremony scheduled for 10
a.m., he was to take over three sacred imperial treasures that
symbolize the throne and have been handed down through generations
of emperors.
   Two rising-sun flags on the Imperial Palace were lowered to
half-staff, the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges suspended their
usual half-day's trading Saturday and Japan headed into a mourning
period that followed much quiet preparation as the emperor lingered
on his deathbed for 3{ months.
   The government said Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno would continue
his trip to Europe, where he is attending a conference on chemical
weapons in Paris. In September, Uno canceled a trip to Washington
and the United Nations because of Hirohito's illness.
   The association governing sumo wrestling, the unique Japanese
sport that was one of Hirohito's favorite diversions, said it would
postpone until Monday a tournament scheduled to start Sunday.
   The palace set up a place where people could sign a condolence
register, and a trickle of people started to arrive before 9 a.m.
   Cabinet members, wearing morning coats, assembled to decide a
name for the new emperor's reign.
   Hirohito's reign was known as Showa, and year Showa 64 on the
Japanese calendar had begun on Jan. 1.
   Akihito, his wife Crown Princess Michiko, 54, and other members
of the imperial family had arrived at the palace at 5:40 a.m., soon
after chief court physician Akira Takagi rushed in to attend
Hirohito.
   The world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same family since
at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 B.C. _ passed
automatically to Akihito.
   The regalia he was to receive, consisting of a sword, jewels and
a mirror, were said in legend to have been handed down from the sun
goddess, the imperial family's mythic ancestor.
   Hirohito's funeral, likely to be held in about six weeks, will be
a massive event to mark the figurative and literal turning of an
era, since years in Japan are numbered from the start of his reign
in 1926.
   Akihito's formal coronation will take place in about two years if
his father's pattern is followed. But the pattern is so old _
Hirohito reigned for 62 years and 13 days _ and Japan is so
different now that precedent may not be followed.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's government will be under
pressure to handle the passage correctly, to honor Hirohito properly
without giving too much rein to those who want to restore the
pre-war imperial aura of divinity.
   Hirohito's reign covered almost half the turbulent times of
forced modernization, repeated warfare and a vigorous rise from the
radioactive ashes of World War II that together have made Japan a
formidable world force since it was pried out of its island
isolation in the 1850s.
