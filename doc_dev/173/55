   Many Japanese sense a new era with the death of
Emperor Hirohito, whose reign spanned depression, militarism,
defeat, hardship and riches, and believe his son Akihito may open up
the imperial system.
   While mourning the 87-year-old emperor, they were relieved to see
an end to the six turbulent decades of Hirohito's Showa era and the
smooth transition to Heisei, or ``achieving peace,'' the name given
Emperor Akihito's reign.
   Some stores turned off advertising signs for two days after
Hirohito died Jan. 7, but Japan had been prepared by his long
illness and it was business as usual for most people, a turning
point rather than a traumatic loss.
   Until Hirohito renounced his divinity after World War II,
emperors were regarded as living gods. Polls in recent years
indicated a small minority of Japanese still considered him one.
   Akihito is seen as an ordinary person, which some welcome and
others regret.
   ``Hirohito represented the darker side of Japanese history,''
said Gregory Clark, professor of Japanese studies at Sophia
University in Tokyo.
   ``With the appearance of a new emperor, there's a fresh start
going on. You can see it particularly in the stock market, and I
think it will spread to other areas.''
   In the first three trading days after the emperor died, the main
index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 933.91 points, or 3.1
percent.
   ``He wasn't a god, but he was somehow different from ordinary
people,'' said Hiroko Gotoh, 22. ``I don't think I've changed inside
because of his death, but I have a feeling an era has changed in
Japan.''
   Fears were expressed that rightists would use Hirohito's death to
increase imperial power. Akihito quickly indicated, however, that he
would be closer to the people and perhaps let more light through the
``chrysanthemum curtain'' surrounding the imperial family, which
uses the flower as its symbol.
   In his first public statement, the new emperor wore a plain
Western morning suit and spoke in straightforward language instead
of the classic Chinese-style ``chokugo'' his father used on the same
occasion in 1926. The speech and some other transition rites,
private in the past, were televised.
   Akihito, 55, said he would try to ``constantly be at one with the
people'' and would join with them ``to preserve the constitution of
Japan.''
   That was widely interpreted as a message to those in the
governing Liberal Democratic Party and elsewhere who have called for
change in the document imposed by the United States after the
Japanese surrender, which renounces war and gives the emperor no
real political power.
   ``It was quite significant that he said he would protect the
constitution,'' Clark said. ``Normally a Japanese monarch would not
take such a political position.''
   As the first emperor who never was considered divine, Akihito
will have an opportunity to shape the imperial institution's future
and define its place in society.
   Cabinet decisions on the transition raised questions about the
government's attitude toward the imperial system, which past
officials used to foster a sense of Japanese racial and cultural
uniqueness and to rally support for the invasion of much of Asia.
   Opposition parties criticized the government decision to sponsor
portions of Hirohito's funeral, scheduled Feb. 24, and two other
transition rites linked to the Shinto religion. They said
sponsorship might violate constitutional separation of religion and
state.
   Several families who protested government-mandated school
memorials to Hirohito by keeping their children home reported
receiving death threats.
   The Shinto origin of the rites illustrates the close ties between
the former state religion, based in nature, and the emperor, who is
declared by myth to be a direct descendant of the sun goddess.
   Polls indicate most Japanese support the current imperial system,
which defines the emperor as the ``symbol of the state and the unity
of the people,'' but not head of state.
   People who want to restore imperial divinity and increase the
monarch's role as spiritual leader find themselves with a new
emperor who ``will never become a living god because he is too
human,'' said Kenichiro Sembon, senior editor of Asahi Journal, a
leading liberal news weekly.
   ``Why should such an ordinary person become an emperor?'' he
said. ``Now is a good time for us to start thinking about that, and
about all aspects of the imperial system, including whether we need
the system at all.''
   Clark commented: ``I wonder whether the ultra-nationalists will
be able to maintain their interest in a pacifist emperor.''
   Groups on both the left and right identify the imperial system
with militarism and nationalism.
   ``What I fear is that an emperor without Hirohito's popularity
might cause the imperial system to become more remote from the
people, and rightists might use force to try to bring the system
back into prominence,'' a senior politician of the governing party
said privately.
   Akihito's conduct before becoming emperor already has inched open
the doors of the secretive Imperial Household Agency, which oversees
royal affairs.
   His father was tutored by war heroes chosen by court
chamberlains. Akihito studied with ordinary students and was tutored
by American pacifist Elizabeth Gray Vining, who is said to have
given him a sense of the equality of all people.
   He is the first Japanese monarch to select his own wife, and
chose a commoner with a Western-style education. Akihito and Empress
Michiko raised their three children themselves, ending the imperial
practice of separating children from parents.
   News accounts said Akihito and Michiko frequently have been at
odds with the Imperial Household Agency.
   ``Reforming the Imperial Household Agency is the most serious
problem facing the new emperor,'' said Takeshi Maezawa, ombudsman of
the conservative Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper. ``Japan won't
be able to move fully into the 21st century under the agency's
current situation.''
