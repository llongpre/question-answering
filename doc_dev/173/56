   Emperor Akihito formally became Japan's new monarch
in all-day enthronement ceremonies that were marred by dozens of
terrorist attacks, and national TV said Tuesday that police fear
more radical violence is likely.
   The rites on Monday marked the beginning of nearly a month of
festivities surrounding Japan's first coronation in 62 years.
   Akihito performs the most controversial ritual, a communion with
the gods of Shinto, on the night of Nov. 22-23. Government-run
television said police will review security measures before then
because their great mobilization on Monday failed to stop numerous
leftist attacks.
   The only police reaction was to note that Monday's ceremonies
went off without disruption or delay. Just one injury was reported.
   The enthronement celebrations, featuring prayers to the sun
goddess and other rituals dating to ancient times, have drawn
criticism from groups that believe government funding for them is
unconstitutional.
   Many Japanese ignored the ceremonies, taking advantage of the
special enthronement day holiday to take weekend trips and crowd
golf courses and driving ranges.
   One poll suggested nearly half of all Japanese were not
interested in the enthronement.
   Foreign dignitaries traveled from 158 countries for the
ceremony, which U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
called an event of ``great sobriety and dignity.''
   The visitors included Vice President Dan Quayle and Britain's
Prince Charles and Princess Diana.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu led more than 2,000 guests in three
cheers of ``Banzai!'' the traditional wish for longeviy. Kaifu
said the guests were ``filled with a mood of celebration.''
   For the enthronement, the 56-year-old Akihito wore an imperial
silk kimono in a reddish-brown shade only he is allowed to wear,
and a black crown of ancient design.
   He stood under the octagonal canopy of his black-lacquered
throne, facing a palace courtyard filled with attendants carrying
bows and swords. With him inside the palace's Hall of Pines were 12
princesses and princes.
   Empress Michiko, dressed in an multicolored court gown with her
face painted white, stood motionless at her own throne, at
Akihito's side. Crown Prince Naruhito, dressed in bright orange to
indicate his status as royal heir, stood closest to his father's
throne.
   The emperor solemnly held aloft the proclamation of his
coronation and promised to ``discharge my duties as symbol of the
state and of the unity of the people'' under Japan's postwar
constitution. The constitution changed the imperial role to that of
a national symbol, not sacred sovereign.
   Later, the imperial household gave a banquet for about 350
guests, most of them foreign royalty or government dignitaries. The
menu featured Japanese delicacies.
   Critics say the coronation and its accompanying rites are based
too closely on the traditional religious rituals used for Akihito's
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, who presided during Japan's
plunge into militarism and World War II.
   Ultra-leftist radicals on Monday set fires that damaged several
Shinto shrines, stopped two train lines and launched mortar-style
projectiles at five military bases.
   Radicals were suspected of involvement in a total of at least 35
incidents, the most ever recorded in a single day.
   Police said radicals launched 10 projectiles at the palace. All
of them missed, and one instead crashed into a locker room at a
women's university. One woman was injured while being evacuated
from a train.
   About 37,000 police were mobilized for the ceremonies. Nearly
10,000 officers were on hand for a 30-minute, three-mile motorcade
by the imperial couple. About 117,000 Japanese citizens lined the
route.
   During the motorcade's journey, a string of firecrackers went
off. Genshu Hanayagi, a dancer well-known for her anti-monarchist
views, was arrested in a scuffle that followed. She faced charges
of violating traffic laws.
   Shortly before the motorcade trip began, a 27-year-old man
attempted ritual suicide by slitting his belly with a fruit knife
in front of the palace. The man's motives were not known. He was
admitted to a nearby hospital, but officials refused to comment on
his condition.
