   The palace said today that the ailing Emperor
Hirohito's condition was improving, but Cabinet ministers stayed
near telephones for fear of the worst and members of the imperial
family canceled scheduled activities.
   The frail 87-year-old, who began vomiting blood Monday and has
since had three transfusions, was in serious but stable condition
and under constant medical surveillance, palace and press reports
said.
   A chapter in Japan's modern history will close with the passing
of Hirohito, the world's oldest and longest reigning monarch. The
Japanese media monitored the emperor's condition round-the-clock.
   Takenori Sugawara, a spokesman for the Imperial Household
Agency, said today that Hirohito was still receiving intravenous
care but was fully conscious. He said the emperor appeared ``headed
in a favorable direction.''
   He said palace doctors were not planning any more blood
transfusions.
   Two doctors, three nurses and two palace stewards were keeping
close watch over Hirohito in his bedroom, the palace also
announced, adding that there were no plans to hospitalize the
emperor.
   Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko visited the emperor
today in their fourth visit since he fell ill. The 54-year-old
crown prince is the first in line to follow Hirohito.
   Doctors began administering emergency care after the emperor
vomited blood repeatedly from Monday night through Tuesday morning,
the imperial agency said.
   The nationally circulated daily Yomiuri Shimbun, quoting palace
medical sources, said doctors acted after Hirohito initially
vomited about 1 pint of blood. Court physicians suspected an
enlarged pancreas was causing hemorrhaging of the emperor's
duodenum, part of the small intestine, according to the sources.
   In September, doctors performed an intestinal bypass operation
in the same area, circumventing a blockage caused by the enlarged
pancreas.
   Major Japanese dailies carried front-page headlines today
reporting that the emperor remained in serious condition, while
about 100 reporters maintained close watch over the Imperial
Palace, a green oasis in the center of Tokyo.
   A small group of about 20 well-wishers gathered in the large
square in front of the palace _ kneeling down in prayer, according
to television reports.
   But strollers in Tokyo's Ginza, a popular shopping and nightlife
district, appeared unaffected by news of the emperor's failing
health.
   Many older Japanese still feel deep affection for Hirohito, but
younger people tend to have less interest in the imperial family.
   Hirohito has occupied the throne since 1926, considered a living
god for the first 20 years of his reign. After World War II, U.S.
occupation officials forced him publicly to renounce his divinity.
Under Japan's postwar constitution, he became a symbol of Japan's
unity but exercised no real power.
   As the vigil over the emperor continued, members of the imperial
family cancelled all scheduled events, news reports said.
   Prince Hiro, 28, the crown prince's eldest son and second in
line to the throne, canceled an appearance today at a performance
of the visiting Milano Scala opera. Prince Mikasa, the emperor's
younger brother, called off a two-day trip outside Tokyo.
   Prince Aya, 22, the crown prince's second son, who is studying
in Britain, was to return to Japan later today with former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who cut short his visit to Britain,
according to press reports.
   The government on Tuesday instructed all Cabinet members to
remain within calling distance of the capital in the event the
emperor died.
   The Cabinet was expected to meet Thursday to shift Hirohito's
state responsibilities to the crown prince.
   Three times in recent weeks, the emperor has been bedridden with
a fever. A news report last week said he had lost 20 pounds of the
130 pounds he weighed before his surgery.
