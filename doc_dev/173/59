  [Text] Tokyo, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji said today relations between China and Japan have 
made "a positive impact" on peace and stability in the 
Asian-Pacific region and the world at large. 
  The year of 1992 marked the entry of the bilateral 
relationship into a new phase of development, Zhu, here on a 
nine-day official visit, said in a speech titled "China's Reform 
and Development in 1994." 
  In 1992, Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin visited 
Tokyo while Japanese Emperor Akihito traveled to Beijing in 
celebration of the 20th anniversary of the normalization of 
diplomatic ties, he explained. 
  "The Chinese Government and people attach great importance 
to 
their good neighborly relations with Japan," he said. 
  He said China shares much in common with Japan and the two 
countries complement each other economically. 
  Bilateral trade totaled 39 billion U.S. dollars last year, 
an increase of 54 percent over the previous year, the 
vice-premier noted.
