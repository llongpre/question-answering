  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 1 KYODO -- The year 1994 will be busy 
for Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko with preparations 
proceeding for the couple's visits to the United States and 
Europe, the first attempt by a Japanese monarch to travel 
overseas twice in one year. 
  In mid-June, the emperor and the empress are expected to 
travel to the U.S., where they will visit eastern, southern and 
western cities. They also plan to make a stopover in Hawaii 
during the journey, official sources said. 
  Preparations are also under way for their trip to Britain 
and 
France in autumn, the sources said. 
  It will be the first time that a Japanese emperor will make 
more than one overseas trip in a year, they said. 
  A visit to the Middle East by Crown Prince Naruhito and his 
wife, Princess Masako, is also being considered, the first 
overseas trip by the couple since they got married last June, 
the sources said. 
  Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko spends [as received] the 
New Year's Day at a newly constructed residence within the 
Imperial Palace compound in central Tokyo. 
  On the opening of the New Year, the emperor said in a 
statement that he hopes disaster-stricken people will be able to 
stand firmly on their feet as quickly as possible, saying that 
the past year was full of numerous sufferings. 
  "It is highly regrettable that throughout the world many 
people are still victims of local conflicts," Emperor Akihito 
said in the statement. "On the other hand, it is gratifying to 
note signs of movement in the right direction, as in the case of 
Cambodia." 
  An unusually cool summer hit the already harsh economic 
environment and more than 400 people died or went missing in an 
earthquake and cloudbursts in Japan. 
  On the quake-battered Okushiri Island in Hokkaido, Emperor 
Akihito said in one of his waka [Japanese-style poem], "I am 
sorrowful, to see the smoke wreaths rising, from things burning 
out, 
  There along the island shore, all strewn with broken 
houses." 
  In February, the emperor and the empress will visit Iwo Jima 
and the Ogasawara islands, where the fiercest fighting in World 
War II took place. The imperial couple will make the visit to 
the islets in the Pacific Ocean, far south of Tokyo, to mark the 
25th anniversary of their return by the United States in 1969, 
Imperial Household Agency officials said. 
  Empress Michiko expressed her joy in her waka at her eldest 
son's marriage to Masako Owada, a former career diplomat. 
  "Hand in hand, may you climb together, 
  The mountain, which, now green with foliage, must be 
garmented in serene beauty," her waka said. 
  Empress Michiko, who collapsed on her 59th birthday last 
October 20 and suffered speech impairment, has partially 
recovered her ability to speak, and her condition is slowly 
getting better, doctors said.
