   Kneeling before an altar to the sun goddess and
sipping sacred rice wine, Emperor Akihito's youngest son wed his
college sweetheart Friday morning in a ceremony replete with
symbolism.
   The solemn 15-minute ceremony at the shrine dedicated to the sun
goddess Amaterasu ended with the symbolic sipping of rice wine from
a white ceramic cup, sealing Prince Aya's nuptial bonds with
graduate student Kiko Kawashima.
   Miss Kawashima, who has no royal background, has generally been
welcomed as representing another step in bringing the palace and
Japan's people closer together. She is the second commoner to marry
into the royal family. Empress Michiko became the first when she
and Akihito, then crown prince, wed in 1959.
   The wedding was the first for an imperial family member in six
years, and the first in three decades for a prince of Aya's rank.
Aya, 24, is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne after his
elder brother, Crown Prince Naruhito, 30, who has yet to marry.
   Clad in the black silk robe and cap with arched tailpiece that
designate him as an imperial prince, Aya and Miss Kawashima, 23,
walked to the shrine in slow, deliberate steps. An attendant
carried the train of the bride's green, maroon and orange kimono,
nearly a dozen layers thick.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and other government leaders and
imperial family members were among the 156 guests watching from
outside the wooden ``Kashikodokoro'' shrine.
   In the ceremony, the prince, kneeling beside his bride, made
vows to the sun goddess in the classical Japanese used by priests
of Japan's indigenous Shinto religion.
   Reflecting the royal couple's special fondness for Thailand, a
country they have both visited, Thai Princess Maha Chakri
Sirindhorn was also invited to the wedding, the first member of a
foreign royal family to receive such an honor.
   Aya's royal parents, in keeping with tradition, were absent
Friday morning, but like the rest of the nation could watch the
ceremony on live television. They will receive the couple later in
the afternoon in the Imperial Palace.
   The emperor was also to bestow Aya with a new title, Prince
Akishino, to mark Aya's establishing an independent household.
Akishino is the name of a town in western Japan with close ties to
the imperial family.
   Many aspects of the wedding ceremony closely followed imperial
traditions, some going back 1,000 years or more.
   Traditions aside, the ceremony was being hailed as the public's
first taste of the new imperial era, called Heisei or ``achieving
peace,'' which began with the death of Emperor Hirohito on Jan. 7,
1989.
   Akihito ascended the throne immediately afterward, and he has
been credited with trying to create a more open, softer image for
Japan's often distant and mysterious imperial family.
   ``This is the first big event of the Heisei Era,'' said former
imperial chamberlain Minoru Hamao, who served as a close attendant
to Akihito for 20 years.
   ``The princess is the perfect person for today's imperial
household, and I'm sure that as time goes on she will gradually
help bring the monarchy even closer to the people,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   Though Miss Kawashima has not created a sensation along the
lines of the ``Michiko boom,'' her warm smile and quiet,
conservative manner have won over much of the public.
   Because of her relatively humble background _ her father is an
economics professor at Gakushuin University, a former peers school
_ she was called a modern-day Cinderella by the popular media.
   She was also dubbed the ``Apartment Princess'' because she lived
with her family in faculty housing on the Gakushuin campus, where
she is working on her masters degree in social psychology.
   Aya, a Gakushuin graduate, met Miss Kawashima at a bookstore on
the campus in 1985.
   Soon after their engagement was approved by the government in
September, it was rumored that Aya and Miss Kawashima would
honeymoon in Thailand, a country Aya particularly likes.
   For the honeymoon, however, tradition has taken precedence. The
royal couple's first trip together will be to the Grand Shrines of
Ise and the tomb of the Emperor Jimmu, both in central Japan.
Emperor Jimmu, according to myth, was Japan's first monarch and
ascended in 660 B.C.
   Police say that because of threats from leftist radicals, 9,000
officers were assigned to guard the wedding activities, though most
were being held at either the Imperial Palace, which is surrounded
by a moat and forbidding stone walls, or the Akasaka Palace, the
well-secured residence of the emperor and empress.
