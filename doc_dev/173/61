   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's trip to Japan
has stirred up hard feelings from Japan's militaristic past,
sentiments that extend throughout much of Asia's Pacific rim.
   A major aim of the three-day state visit, which began early
Thursday with Roh's arrival, is to ease past animosities. But the
trip has provoked debate over Japan's lingering responsibility for
its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula.
   Japanese extremist groups opposed to Roh have set off explosives
to destroy Korean buildings and cars owned by Japanese government
officials.
   In Seoul, protests against Roh's visit culminated Wednesday in a
ritual suicide attempt. A 34-year-old man demanding the Japanese
emperor apologize for Japan's past actions stabbed himself outside
the Japanese Embassy. Hospital officials said the man was in stable
condition.
   Bands of elderly Koreans protest daily outside the embassy in
Seoul, demanding compensation for the hundreds of thousands of
Koreans who were forced to fight and work for wartime Japan.
   Elsewhere in Asia, too, memories of hardships under Japanese
rule still hinder efforts to leave the past behind. Such lingering
bitterness would make it hard for Japan to claim a leading
political role in the region _ despite its great wealth.
   ``According to international law, Japan's legal responsibility
for the war has been fulfilled,'' said Kisaburo Yokota, a law
professor at the International Christian University in Tokyo. ``But
especially in Korea, as well as China and other countries, public
feelings are still strong. They feel Japan hasn't reflected
thoroughly on its past actions.''
   Japanese power struck first in Korea before World War II.
Japan's military empire extended from Manchuria to Burma, through
Southeast Asia to the Philippines in the South Pacific and to the
Aleutians.
   South Korean officials have said they expect a clear apology for
Japan's colonial rule, preferably from Emperor Akihito, during
Roh's visit.
   But for Japan, such an apology would raise questions about the
emperor's role under the postwar constitution and about how much
responsibility Akihito's father, the late Emperor Hirohito, had for
Japan's wartime actions.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, in remarks to Parliament, has
characterized Japan as the aggressor in the war and vowed to
``express frank regret about our mistakes in the past and apologize
for them.''
   But some governing party politicians said Japan should not
``prostrate itself'' in apology. Their views are shared by
right-wing extremists, who glorify the imperial family and view the
demand for an apology as an insult.
   The division of the Korean peninsula is a legacy of Japan's
colonization, and Roh's visit gave Communist North Korea a chance
to blast him for bringing ``shame and humiliation to our nation.''
   Much as the two Germanys' relations with other European
countries are affected by lingering memories of World War II,
Japan's legacy of aggression has left wounds in Asia.
   Japanese officials often seem torn, however, over the need to
balance sensitivity with national pride.
   The government has heard repeated Asian protests over
euphemistic descriptions of wartime atrocities in history
textbooks, and several Cabinet members have been forced to resign
after defending Japan's militaristic past.
   Japan was reluctant to criticize China after the harsh crackdown
in June on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. The reason given by
Japanese officials was Japan's invasion of China 50 years ago.
   Tokyo's relations with Seoul are complicated by discriminatory
treatment of 680,000 Koreans living in Japan, many of them
descendants of forced laborers.
   Japanese officials have said they hoped the visit, only the
second by a South Korean leader, would allow them to put the past
well behind them.
   But analysts say that apologies and agreements will not halt the
antagonism.
   ``It's an emotional problem, so it will take time to resolve
it,'' Yokota said. ``That's why it's so important for Japan to do
all it can to resolve it as soon as possible.''
