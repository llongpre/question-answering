   Emperor Akihito today set the tone for his reign by
pledging to work for peace and preserve Japanese democracy, but said
he faced ``awesome responsibilities'' after the death of his father,
Hirohito.
   The four-minute speech was Akihito's first public statement since
he ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne when Hirohito died of cancer
Saturday at age 87. It was delivered at the Imperial Palace during a
simple ceremony attended by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and 237
other dignitaries.
   Outside, hundreds of thousand of Japanese streamed past to pay
their respects to Hirohito, who reigned for 62 years.
   ``Shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the awesome
responsibilities I undertake, I stand humble before you,'' said
Akihito, who was clad in a black cutaway and gray trousers.
   ``I pledge myself to continue in the spirit of his late majesty,
making his desire to constantly be at one with the people my desire
as well, joining together with you to preserve the constitution of
Japan, and thereby execute my duties faithfully,'' he added.
   Japan's post-war constitution, which bans the emperor from any
role in government and limits him to ceremonial functions, formed
the basis for the country's democracy. It limits the emperor's role
to signing bills into law and serving as ``symbol of the state and
the unity of the people.''
   ``I do fervently desire the further development of Japan, peace
on Earth and enhanced well-being for all peoples,'' Akihito said.
   He spoke clearly and solemnly, with the new Empress Michiko, 54,
on his left wearing a black dress and veil and their son, Crown
Prince Naruhito, 28, on his right.
   By Japanese tradition, Akihito's statement was his first Imperial
Rescript, in which a new emperor sets a tone for his reign.
   The rite, in the palace's main ceremonial hall, was an important
milestone in the transition to Akihito's new imperial era of Heisei,
or ``Achieving Peace.''
   On Sunday, Hirohito's body was wrapped in a white cloth and
placed in a coffin made of Japanese cypress at the palace in
preparation for the Feb. 24 burial. Representatives of more than 130
countries, including up to 50 heads of state or government, are
expected to attend.
   Hirohito's era, called Showa, or ``Enlightened Peace,'' ended
with his death, and according to Japanese tradition he becomes known
as Emperor Showa. His reign stretched from Japan's descent into
militarism and defeat in World War II to its impressive recovery
into an economic superpower.
   Thousands of police were deployed today to prevent violence by
radical leftist and rightist groups, for whom the emperor embodies
Japanese militarism and nationalism.
   Hirohito was revered as a living god until he was forced to
renounce his divinity at the end of World War II, and Japanese
soldiers fought and died during the war in the monarch's name.
   Two old soldiers have hanged themselves since learning of
Hirohito's passing, saying in suicide notes that they wanted to
follow the emperor in death. An 87-year-old former army man hanged
himself Saturday, and the body of a former navy officer was found
Sunday hanging from a tree in a temple compound.
   Mourners continued to stream to the palace today to sign
condolence registers outside the main gate. On Sunday, the palace
said 438,376 people braved drizzling rain to honor the late emperor
at the palace, and the number of signers today had reached 223,020
by 3:30 p.m.
   Japan's stock market today boomed to a record high closing and
its biggest gain in a year in the first session since Hirohito's
death.
   A dealer at Nomura Securities said small investors were drawn
back into the market after the emperor's death.
   ``During his three-month-long illness, many individual investors
were extremely cautious and anxious about what might happen when the
emperor died,'' said Michio Katsumata. ``But that's over now.''
