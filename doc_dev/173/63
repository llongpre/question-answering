  [Text] Seoul, March 24 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam left here this morning for official visits to Japan 
and China aimed at improving cooperation with the two countries. 
  In a speech at the Seoul airport, Kim said that he will 
discuss with Japanese and Chinese leaders cooperation among the 
three countries as well as peace and stability in eastern Asia, 
including the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. 
  He said that Japan and China were geographically and 
historically South Korea's close neighbors, and that the three 
will become partners in the forthcoming Asia-Pacific era. 
  He pointed out that interdependence among nations is 
increasingly important, especially since the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade reached an agreement which will bring about fierce 
competition in world trade. 
  This situation highlights the significance of close 
cooperation among South Korea, Japan and China in seeking joint 
stability and prosperity, he stated. 
  The three countries can benefit from complimentary 
cooperation to improve their own competitiveness as they have 
different business structures and are in different stages of 
development, President Kim stressed. 
  He added that Japan is South Korea's second largest trading 
partner, while China is the third largest and has attracted most 
of South Korea's overseas investment. 
  Kim is expected to meet with Japanese Emperor Akihito and 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, address the Japanese 
parliament, and visit Waseda University. 
  He is scheduled to leave Japan on March 26 for Shanghai, 
China's largest city, and will remain in China for five days. 
During his stay he will hold talks with President Jiang Zemin, 
Premier Li Peng and other top Chinese leaders. 
  President Kim will also visit the economic development zones 
in Shanghai and Tianjin and deliver a speech at Beijing 
University.
