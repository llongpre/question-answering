   A breeze of change has begun to blow through the
Imperial Palace since Emperor Akihito took the throne. But change
doesn't come easily to a 1,200-year-old monarchy.
   To most of the nation, Akihito remains a distant figure seen
only through the bits of news gathered by a small group of
reporters who cover the daily activities of the royal family from
offices behind the Tokyo palace's moat and high stone walls.
   That news, however, has portrayed the man on the Chrysanthemum
Throne in a softer, more personable light than his enigmatic
father, Hirohito, who died Jan. 7.
   ``He is a more democratic person than his father was, because
they were raised in a different era,'' said one palace reporter,
who has covered both emperors. ``He really wants to get out among
the people, and has surprised some attendants by suddenly changing
his schedule to do so.''
   Such comparisons between Hirohito, who was revered as a god
until the end of World War II, and Akihito _ the first emperor to
assume the throne not as a deity but as a man _ have dominated
Akihito's seven-month reign.
   On his first trip away from the capital, Akihito used a less
regal form of speech than his father when addressing a crowd and
insisted on fewer uniformed guards along procession routes, though
more plainclothes police were deployed.
   The 55-year-old emperor reportedly even asked for the removal of
a curtain separating himself and Empress Michiko from other
passengers on a chartered flight to the tree-planting festival in
late May.
   ``I think it's fine. ... The imperial household must adapt to
historical developments,'' said Prince Mikasa, Akihito's uncle and
the oldest male member of the imperial family. The 74-year-old
spoke in a rare interview with the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest
newspaper.
   Akihito shocked traditionalists in 1959, while still crown
prince, when he married a commoner, a union warmly welcomed by the
Japanese public.
   The royal couple then broke with the past by raising their two
sons and daughter by themselves. Akihito was sent off to be reared
by chamberlains at the age of 3.
   More changes were expected after the death of Hirohito, 87,
whose 62-year reign covered a tumultuous period of history many
Japanese still struggle to understand.
   During his reign _ the longest in Japanese history _ Japan waged
a disastrous war in Asia, suffered a humiliating defeat against the
Allies in 1945 and rose from the ashes of its bombed-out cities to
become a modern economic superpower.
   His death was the end of an era. But it remains difficult for
Akihito to make major changes in an institution that can trace its
roots back to at least the 8th century and by legend to Emperor
Jimmu in 660 B.C.
   Akihito's first news conference, open to 50 selected foreign and
Japanese reporters, is scheduled for Aug. 4, seven months after he
became emperor. It is likely to be as formal as those his father
used to hold.
   Like Hirohito, who met with the foreign and Japanese news media
in several such encounters, Akihito will answer only a set of
questions submitted in advance and negotiated with palace officials
for several weeks.
   The meeting is expected to last less than an hour and cover
questions such as those Hirohito accepted from reporters: the war,
his role in modern Japan, palace life, whether things are likely to
change.
   A a handful of chamberlains, personal doctors, nurses and
ritualists continues to surround the emperor.
   Most of Hirohito's chamberlains continue to carry out palace
duties of some sort, and disagreements between the Akihito and
Hirohito camps are not uncommon, the palace reporter said,
requesting that he not be identified by name.
   The chamberlains, themselves often descended from nobility or
illustrious families, are known to oppose innovation, even by
younger chamberlains, as many see themselves as the protectors of
tradition.
   ``It will take at least 10 years for the new emperor to come
into his own,'' the reporter said.
   Little change is expected in the daily rituals carried out at
three shrines on the palace's wooded grounds.
   Ritualists dressed in traditional robes and headwear present
offerings of food and wine at the shrines _ dedicated to the gods
in general, the imperial ancestors and the sun goddess, Amaterasu,
from whom Japan's royal line is said to have descended.
   Hirohito renounced his divinity as a ``false concept'' at the
urging of the U.S.-led occupation forces in 1946, and a new
constitution, omitting passages stating that the emperor had a
special relationship to the gods, was drafted in 1947.
   The 1947 constitution also put an end to state backing of
Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, which had been transformed
from a kind of nature worship into an emperor-centered form of
nationalism by a military government seeking to fuel its war
machine.
   But just before Hirohito's death, senior ritualist Toshinobu
Maeda said the renunciation of divinity did not affect palace
rites, and neither would Akihito's accession.
   Since the revised constitution took effect, the ritualists have
been the private employees of the emperor instead of being in
government pay.
   Fear of stirring up the state-religion controversy has delayed a
government announcement of where another rite, the Daijo-sai, will
be held.
   During that mystical ceremony, which will be held in November
1990, the emperor traditionally has had his first communion with
Amaterasu and then be reborn a god. News reports have said staging
the complex Daijo-sai could cost as much as $70 million.
   Tokyo has apparently been chosen for security reasons, but
officials refuse to publicly rule out Kyoto, the ancient capital in
western Japan where the imperial family resided for more than a
millenium.
