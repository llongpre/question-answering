   What does it take to become a princess? It takes
class. Lots of them, nearly every day.
   During the next month, 13 carefully selected tutors will try to
instill a royal aura in Kiko Kawashima, a college student who will
wed Emperor Akihito's younger son in June.
   With a notebook clutched to her chest and her hair pulled back
in a ponytail, Miss Kawashima arrived at the palace Tuesday morning
in a black, chauffeur-driven limousine to begin her ``princess
studies.''
   The first class on the agenda was religious rites and coronation
ceremonies. The teacher was Torahiko Nagazumi, a former chamberlain
and classmate of the late Emperor Hirohito.
   Miss Kawashima's curriculum, worked out by the Imperial
Household Agency, will cover eight topics: classical poetry,
calligraphy, Japanese history, palace rituals, laws related to the
imperial family, the imperial system, the constitution and
religious ceremonies.
   The quiet 23-year-old, who already has won over the nation with
her shy smile, is to attend 28 hours of classes spread out over the
next month. Many Japanese women also attend classes before getting
married, but for most, flower arrangement, cooking and the tea
ceremony are the popular subjects.
   The palace timed the classes to coincide with spring vacation at
the prestigious Gakushuin University, where Miss Kawashima is a
graduate student of psychology and where her father teaches
economics.
   The briefness of her royal studies _ Empress Michiko's lasted
nearly twice as long _ reflects the omission of English, since she
learned that language while living in the United States as a child.
   And as the wife of Prince Aya, who is second in line to the
throne, less will be required of her than of the woman who marries
Aya's elder brother, Crown Prince Naruhito.
   The government plans to spend roughly $1 million on the June 29
wedding for Miss Kawashima and Aya, who is 24.
   Naruhito has said he would like to marry by the age of 30, but
he will reach that landmark later this month and is having trouble
finding a suitable mate.
   A recent article in a conservative weekly magazine, Shukan
Shincho, expressed fear that because of Miss Kawashima's lack of
noble background, 28 hours will not be enough time to prepare her
for the highly organized and tradition-bound life of a princess.
   Tabloids, meanwhile, have warned Miss Kawashima to be wary of
members of the old nobility, who reportedly have made life in the
palace difficult for Empress Michiko. Michiko, the magazines
report, is seen as an outsider because she was the first commoner
to marry into the royal family.
   Miss Kawashima will be the second.
   But a palace source said changes in the curriculum were made to
suit the times.
   The substitution of constitutional studies for etiquette has
been heralded by Japan's media as a reflection of a promise Emperor
Akihito to uphold the often controversial document. Akihito made
the promise shortly after succeeding Hirohito, who died last year.
   Under the constitution, written mainly by U.S.-led occupation
authorities after World War II, Japan's monarch is a ``symbol''
with little more than a ceremonial role.
   Right-wing extremists, who revere the monarch as a living god,
have demanded that the constitution be rewritten to restore prewar
clauses that referred to the emperor as divine.
   Leftists insist that the postwar basic law should have abolished
the monarchy altogether.
