  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam began a three-day state visit to Japan on Thursday [24 
March] receiving red-carpet treatment and cheering students at a 
welcome ceremony. Kim and the South Korean first lady, who wore 
a pastel-yellow chima chogori traditional Korean dress, shook 
hands and exchanged courtesies with the Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko in the hall of the Akasaka Palace. 
  Students waiting in front of the Akasaka Palace waved small 
South Korean and Japanese flags when Kim and his wife Son 
Myong-sun emerged together with the imperial couple. Kim, who 
was given a full-fledged military welcome attended by most 
cabinet members and heads of both houses of the Diet, looked 
tense during the ceremony despite an occasional smile. 
  After being saluted by honor guards and listening to the 
South Korean and Japanese anthems, Kim and his wife were greeted 
by Crown Prince Naruhito, Crown Princess Masako, Princess Nori 
and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Following Kim's pacing off the honor guards under a partly 
cloudy sky and a short encounter with attending politicians, the 
presidential couple left for an audience with the emperor and 
empress at the Imperial Palace. 
  Ways to avert an open confrontation over North Korea's 
alleged nuclear program are the main focus of Kim's talks in 
Japan and with Chinese leaders later. 
  He told Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who welcomed the 
president at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, that "Russia's cooperation 
is necessary" to solve the dispute stemming from North Korea's 
refusal of full inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  In response Hata, who returned from talks in Russia on 
Monday, told Kim that Moscow seems to be dissatisfied with 
Pyongyang's reactions, Japanese officials said. 
  North Korea says its nuclear program is strictly 
nonmilitary. 
  On Wednesday, Kim put South Korea's 650,000-strong army 
under 
special alert after North Korea warned that Washington's 
decision to dispatch six Patriot antimissile batteries to the 
south will push the Korean peninsula "to the brink of war." 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, originally scheduled to 
accompany Kim, withdrew from the traveling party on short notice 
Wednesday probably due to the increasingly tense situation on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  Kim's Japan visit will be directly followed by a five-day 
state visit to China, starting Saturday afternoon. 
  In a departure ceremony at Seoul airport Thursday, Kim said 
he will try to obtain support from Japan and China to resolve 
the nuclear issue and bring North Korea around to reform and 
openness. 
  "I will explain to the two leaders of Japan and China that 
preserving reconciliation and peace on the Korean peninsula is 
important to ensuring stability and prosperity in the 
Asia-Pacific region as well as in Northeast Asia," Kim said. 
  He said North Korea had created confrontation on the Korean 
peninsula by failing to allow unhindered inspections of its 
nuclear facilities and make progress in inter-Korean dialogue. 
"While keeping the channel of dialogue open, South Korea, with 
the firm security commitment of the United States, is also fully 
determined to fight against any possible provocation by North 
Korea," he said.
