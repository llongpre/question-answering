   Thousands of students shouting
anti-Japanese slogans burned Japanese flags and clashed with police
in three cities today to protest President Roh Tae-woo's trip to
Tokyo, police and news reports said.
   During the first day of the trip today, Japanese Emperor Akihito
expressed regret for Japan's harsh colonial rule of the Korean
peninsula. Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu later was more
explicit, expressing ``sincere remorse and honest apologies'' for
Japanese colonial actions.
   Roh said the two countries ``should strive to remove the dark
shadow of history,'' but Koreans had hoped for a more direct
apology from the emperor.
   Also today, a radical student, 23-year-old Im Chong-suk, leader
was sentenced to 10 years in prison after his conviction for
anti-state activity in sending a colleague to Communist North Korea.
   In another development regarding labor unrest, a union
representing 27,000 workers at the country's biggest auto plant
signed a new contract with the Hyundai Motor Co. to end a strike in
the southern city of Ulsan that began May 15. However, several
hundred workers at the plant staged a sit-in to protest the
agreement, which was not voted on by the union membership.
   Yonhap, the national news agency, said violent anti-Japanese and
anti-U.S. protests occurred at more than a dozen schools in Seoul,
Kwangju and Taegu, involving a total of about 6,000 militant
students.
   ``Let's oppose Roh Tae-woo's trip, which sells out our national
pride,'' students shouted at Yonsei University in Seoul.
   The students say Roh's three-day visit, which began today, is
intended to deepen South Korea's economic dependency on Japan and
strengthen military ties among South Korea, Japan and the United
States.
   About 300 students cheered as they burned an effigy of Roh
wrapped in a Japanese flag, then fought police with firebombs and
rocks outside the Yonsei campus.
   In downtown Seoul, one student used a cigarette lighter to set
fire to one of hundreds of white-and-red Japanese flags hung
alongside the South Korean flag on the city's main boulevard,
police said. The student was arrested.
   The student claimed his family was treated harshly during
Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of Korea and could not bear to see
the Japanese flag flown alongside that of Korea, police said.
   Many Koreans have felt Roh should not have gone to Japan without
assurances of a clear-cut apology from Emperor Akihito for Japan's
colonial rule.
   In a brief speech at a state dinner tonight, Akihito never used
the word apology but referred to the ``unfortunate past between us
for a period in this century.'' The emperor said: ``I think of the
sufferings your people underwent during this unfortunate period,
which was brought about by my country, and cannot but feel the
deepest regret.''
   In Seoul, officials indicated they were generally satisfied with
Akihito's speech. Vice Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said: ``I
think the Japanese government has made tremendous efforts to
satisfy our position.''
   Critics in South Korea say Roh is using the trip to boost his
popularity, which has dropped due to rising prices, labor unrest
and political infighting.
   Students also demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea, saying they hinder unification of the
peninsula with North Korea.
