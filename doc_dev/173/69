   Seven thousand relatives of war victims paused for a
minute of silence Tuesday on the anniversary of World War II's end,
and Emperor Akihito prayed for world peace.
   At least 10 members of the Cabinet of new Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu marked the day by making visiting the Shinto shrine for 2.4
million of Japan's 3.1 million war dead _ including 14 convicted war
criminals.
   Kaifu himself did not visit the Yasukuni Shrine. Opposition
political parties and other groups in Japan say such visits violate
the constitutional separation of religion and state and promote
militarism.
   Akihito, attending a ceremony at a martial arts hall near the
Imperial Palace, stood before 25,000 white and yellow chrysanthemums
and bowed deeply, with Empress Michiko at his side.
   ``Looking back, it has already been 44 years since the end of the
war, and in the midst of the peace and prosperity of today brought
about by the untiring hard work of the people, when I recall the
times replete with hardship, my mind is filled with a thousand
emotions,'' Akihito said.
   ``On the occasion of this day, in remembrance of the war victims,
I think of the many people who lost their lives and of their
families, and I am deeply saddened,'' he told relatives of war
victims.
   ``I pray, along with all our people, for the future development
of our country and for world peace,'' he said.
   The late Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, announced to the
nation on Aug. 15, 1945, that Japan would surrender to the allies.
   Akihito led Tuesday's ceremony in a minute of silence at noon,
the exact moment that Hirohito's voice was broadcast.
   About 90 members of Parliament from the governing Liberal
Democratic Party also visited the Yasukuni Shrine, Kyodo News
Service reported.
   Last year, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita did not visit Yasukuni
on the war anniversary. His predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone, visited
the shrine in 1985 but later discontinued the visits because of
strong opposition from China and other neighboring nations.
   The Chinese and other nations in the region are wary of any signs
of growing Japanese militarism. In a prewar conquest, Japan seized
Manchuria from China in 1931.
   In his statement marking Tuesday's anniversary, Kaifu said,
``Those who did not return did not die in vain, as we take the
lessons of the war closely to heart and pledge to work for world
peace and the prosperity and harmony of our country in international
society.''
