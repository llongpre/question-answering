   Emperor Akihito on Wednesday led the nation in
honoring the war dead with a minute of silence exactly 45 years
after his father broadcast the Japanese surrender that ended World
War II.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu urged Japan not to repeat ``the
tragedy of the war'' and pointedly did not visit a Shinto shrine
where many of Japan's war dead, including 14 convicted high-ranking
war criminals, are enshrined.
   This was to avoid offending nations that suffered from Japanese
aggression in World War II.
   Akihito, flanked by Empress Michiko, bowed deeply before a
wooden pillar that stood as a monument to the dead and a huge
display of white and yellow chrysanthemums. He prayed for world
peace during a memorial ceremony at the Budokan martial arts hall
near the Imperial Palace.
   About 7,600 survivors of Japan's war victims also participated
in the nationally televised ceremony.
   ``It is a very important task for each of us to establish
lasting peace in order not to repeat the tragedy of the war,''
Kaifu told the hushed crowd.
   Earlier in the day, all members of the Cabinet visited the
Yasukuni Shrine except Kaifu, the chief Cabinet secretary, and the
foreign minister.
   No prime minister since Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1985 has visited
the shrine in an official capacity. Nakasone discontinued the
visits because of opposition from China and other neighboring
nations.
   ``I think it is a natural expectation for the head of the state
to pay respect to those who are sent to a war ... and lost their
lives,'' said a disappointed Tsutomu Hata of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, who was among nearly 200 members of Parliament
who visited the shrine.
   About a dozen riot police vehicles surrounded the shrine to
prevent violence between small groups of demonstrating rightists
and leftists. Each group blared messages through loudspeakers that
were virtually impossible to understand because of the high volume.
   Police later reported that three undetonated bomb-like devices
were found around the television station that broadcast the
memorial ceremony.
   No group claimed responsibility for planting the devices,
officials said, but local media speculated that extremists who
oppose the monarchy may have been responsible.
   The late Emperor Hirohito, posthumously known as Showa,
announced to a stunned nation Aug. 15, 1945, that Japan would
surrender to the Allies. The United States had just leveled the
cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs.
   Akihito, who is Hirohito's son, led the minute of silence at
noon. It even interrupted action at the national high school
baseball tournament in Osaka, one of Japan's most popular sporting
events.
   ``I renew my deep sorrow when I think of many people who lost
their precious lives in the last war and their survivors. ... I
pray for further development of our country and for world peace
with all the people in this country, and I would like to present my
condolences from the bottom of my heart to those who died on the
battlefield and in the war,'' the emperor said.
   At a separate ceremony, Japan Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako
Doi urged the government to admit Japan's responsibility as an
aggressor in World War II.
   Japan has been issuing stronger expressions of remorse for its
actions in Asia during the war.
   When South Korean President Roh Tae-woo visited this spring, for
example, Akihito acknowledged that Japan had caused the Korean
people a great deal of suffering.
   While the emperor did not explicitly apologize for Japanese
actions, Kaifu did.
   In the days leading up to the anniversary, newspapers have run
accounts from readers recalling the horrors of the atom bombings
and the hardships during the war. The English-language Japan Times
newspaper ran a series of accounts of atrocities during the war,
but most of the Japanese-language media still shy away from such
reports.
