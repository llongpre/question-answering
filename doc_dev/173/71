   Although careful to separate religion and the modern
democratic state, organizers of today's grand funeral for Emperor
Hirohito drew deeply from Japan's Shinto rites and ancient
traditions.
   Court music was played, classical poetry read and costumes of
another era worn although government officials said the funeral
ceremony was pared down in length and pomp to ``conform to the
times.''
   The funeral lasted more than 13 hours; the 1927 funeral of
Hirohito's father, Emperor Taisho, took a day and a half and
mourners dared not even look at the hearse bearing Taisho's body.
   Japanese today snapped photographs of the funeral procession, and
Hirohito's son Emperor Akihito carried his own umbrella.
   He delivered a eulogy in common speech, rather than the elaborate
courtly language used for such events in the past.
   But the main funeral ceremony at the Shinjuku Imperial Gardens,
led by the new emperor, was still steeped in the rituals of Shinto,
the indigenous religion which predates yet still co-exists with
Buddhism.
   Sensitive to Japan's postwar constitution, which insists on
separation of religion and state and relegates the emperor to a
figurehead role, the funeral organizers stressed such a duality in
the ceremonies.
   An actual curtain of black color was drawn after the completion
of the Shinto ceremony at the gardens and reopened before the start
of the state funeral. The curtain separated some 9,800 invited
mourners and the imperial family from the hall where Hirohito's body
lay.
   The sound of flutes and ancient court music heralded the start of
the elaborate procession led by Akihito into the funeral grounds.
Empress Michiko, in a flowing black dress and matching veil,
followed a few steps behind.
   Dignitaries, representing 163 nations, were bundled up in dark,
woolen blankets at their seats in a large tent.
   Once Hirohito's coffin was in place in the funeral hall,
specially constructed of Japanese cypress, ritualists made
offerings, including silk and food, to Hirohito, marking the start
of the Shinto ceremonies.
   Dressed in mourning black with a top hat and gloves clutched in
his left hand, a solemn Akihito entered the hall through the
traditional Shinto `torii' gate and bowed deeply. Stepping up to the
altar, he read from a speech handed to him by a chamberlain and bid
a final farewell to his father.
   After he left, Empress Michiko entered the hall, where she
offered a sacred `sakaki' branch to the late emperor.
   Ancient myths hold that gods dwell in the sakaki, or evergreen
trees, which are often used in Shinto rituals as offerings to
deities.
   Chamberlains later removed the offerings from the hall and the
black curtain was drawn to signal the end of the 47-minute Shinto
ceremony.
   By the start of the state funeral a short while later, the
`torii' gate and small tables at the altar had been removed. A
speech by chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi signaled the
beginning.
   Imperial family members again walked up to the funeral hall and
bowed. Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and other government
representatives offered short eulogies.
   The one-hour state funeral concluded with the visiting foreign
dignitaries stepping up to the hall and bowing to the late emperor
and his family.
