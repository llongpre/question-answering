POLL TALK AND A NEW 'WISEGUY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be plenty of talk about California's new governor to-be and other 
election results on the small screen this weekend. But there's also a new 
"Wiseguy," a new Japanese emperor and finally the identity of the killer of 
Laura Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
The new "Wiseguy" is Steven Bauer as the CBS (2)(8) series that once starred 
Ken Wahl returns for another season tonight at 9 p.m. The two-hour premiere 
also stars Maximilian Schell and pop singer Martika. 
</P>
<P>
ABC (7)(3)(10)(42) will compete with its own wiseguy, David Lynch, the 
eccentric director who both directs and stars in tonight's 10 p.m. episode of 
"Twin Peaks," in which the network promises to reveal the murderer of Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
And Sunday at 7:45 p.m., KSCI Channel 18 will televise live the enthronement 
ceremony of Emperor Akihito as the 125th emperor of Japan. Heads of state and 
dignitaries from 150 countries including Vice President Quayle and England's 
Prince Charles are expected in Tokyo for the event.
