  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko on Saturday [12 February] visited two monuments 
to the war dead on Iwo Jima Island, site of one of the fiercest 
Pacific battles during World War II, and where 20,000 Japanese 
soldiers and 7,000 U.S. soldiers were killed. 
  They laid flowers and bowed in front of one of the 
monuments, 
where they met former island residents who were forced to leave 
during the war and representatives of bereaved families of the 
former Imperial Japanese Army. 
  Then they paid their respects at another monument built by 
the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. 
  The imperial couple had flown to Iwo Jima earlier in the 
day, 
to start a three-day visit to the Ogasawara Islands, to 
commemorate the 25th anniversary of the islands' return to Japan 
by the United States. 
  They arrived at the Self-Defense Forces' air station on the 
island, which is the only airfield available in the Ogasawara 
chain. 
  In the evening the emperor and the empress continued their 
trip aboard an aircraft carrier to Chichijima, the main island 
of the Ogasawara chain, where they will stay overnight. 
  On Sunday they will take a helicopter to neighboring 
Hahajima 
Island to attend a judo performance by local residents. 
  Following another stopover at Chichijima Island and meetings 
with islanders, the couple will return to Tokyo on Monday 
evening. 
  It is the couple's first trip to the islands in the western 
Pacific some 1,000 kilometers south of Tokyo and follows their 
historic visit to Okinawa last April to pay respects to Japanese 
soldiers and civilians killed there during World War II. 
  The use of more than 20 Self-Defense Force planes, 10 
warships and 2,000 troops for their trip, however, has drawn 
criticism from civic groups. 
  The Ogasawara islands, which the U.S. calls the Bonin 
Islands, were taken by the U.S. toward the end of World War II 
and were returned to Japan in 1968.
