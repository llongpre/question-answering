   About 2,400 people in two cities Friday protested
enthronement ceremonies for Emperor Akihito and the government's
proposal to send members of the military overseas.
   In downtown Tokyo, 300 riot police stood guard as about 1,400
people marched on busy streets chanting ``Destroy the rituals!'' No
injuries were reported, although police said they made two arrests.
   In Osaka, almost 1,000 people performed music and danced to
protest the ceremonies.
   Opponents say the state-funded rites violate the constitution,
which mandates the separation of religion and state and defines the
emperor as a national symbol.
   Akihito's father, Hirohito, was enthroned as a living god and
was used by militarists to rally support for Japanese aggression in
World War II.
   ``Our country will repeat its history if Japanese citizens allow
the emperor's enthronement rituals,'' warned Yosuke Sugi, a leader
of the ultra-leftist Chukaku-ha group.
   The demonstrators also opposed an unsuccessful bill introduced
by the governing Liberal Democratic Party that would have allowed
the dispatch of Japan's military overseas as part of international
peacekeeping efforts.
   In a predawn ceremony Friday, Emperor Akihito observed the most
controversial rite in his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, in
which he communed with the Shinto sun goddess.
   Legend says the imperial line descended from the goddess and in
the past the rite was believed to give emperors their status as
living gods. About 30,000 police were assigned to security in Tokyo
during the ritual.
   Akihito was formally enthroned on Nov. 12.
