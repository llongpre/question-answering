  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
visits to Japan and China in March are designed to cement 
cooperation with the two powerful neighbors, serving to promote 
peace on the Korean peninsula and enhance Seoul's status to 
better prepare for a new order in Northeast Asia. 
  Just as cooperation with the four major world powers -- the 
United States, Japan, China and Russia -- is important to 
security on the Korean peninsula, so is cooperation with Japan 
and China vital to the growth of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum as a driving force for regional 
cooperation and prosperity. Kim is visiting Tokyo and Beijing to 
strengthen such cooperation. It is significant that Kim is 
meeting the leaders of these two countries when a new post-cold 
war order in Northeast Asia is in the making, especially when 
the North Korean nuclear issue is taking a turn for the better, 
Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman Chu Ton-sik says. 
  Kim's visits will provide an opportunity for him to lay a 
regional footing upon which to promote peace on the Korean 
peninsula and build a multilateral dialogue system for regional 
security, according to other Chongwadae officials. 
  They will also help create an environment for cooperation 
among nations in the region, including Japan and China, 
conducive to a peaceful solution to the North Korean nuclear 
issue and to improved inter-Korean relations leading to eventual 
reunification. Kim will likely ask the two countries to play a 
constructive role in prodding North Korea to emerge from its 
international isolation and ride the world trend of 
globalization. 
  Chong Chong-uk, Kim's senior secretary for Foreign Affairs 
and National Security, says the visits are part of diplomatic 
efforts to secure the firm support of China and Japan in 
attaining peaceful reunification of Korea. They will provide a 
practical opportunity to build a multilateral dialogue system 
benefiting security on the Korean peninsula, including solution 
of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Kim is holding summits with the Japanese and Chinese leaders 
to discuss a new post-cold war order in Northeast Asia, while 
talking about nurturing APEC -- which is still in an infant 
stage -- as a regional organization. 
  On the basis of his experience at the first APEC summit in 
Seattle last November, Kim will focus on how to best develop the 
forum as a regional engine of economic cooperation in 
preparation for the second APEC summit slated for November in 
Indonesia. 
  In view of Japan and China's emergence as South Korea's 
second and third largest trade partners -- with two-way trade 
reaching 28.7 billion U.S. dollars and 9.2 billion dollars, 
respectively, last year, next only to the United States -- Kim's 
trips should lead to increased economic cooperation with the two 
countries. 
  Thus, the visits are part of his summit diplomacy aimed at 
increasing the nation's international competitiveness in an era 
of tough trade competition unleashed by the Uruguay Round accord. 
  In China, Kim will taste the fruits of such summit 
diplomacy, 
including the signing of a Korea-China aviation treaty. But he 
is against the hasty conclusion of any economic pacts just to 
enjoy ceremonial fruit. 
  In Japan, Kim will promote cultural and educational exchange 
programs. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa promised in a 
recent telephone conversation with President Kim to increase the 
number of Koreans studying in Japan under the Japanese 
Government's scholarship program for foreign students from 100 
to 200. 
  Ambassador to Japan Kong No-myong has raised the issue of 
opening the country to Japanese arts, especially to Japanese 
music and films, drawing both positive and negative opinions 
from the public. This issue is expected to attract public 
attention again when Kim visits Japan. 
  In Japan, Kim will make a speech at the Japanese Diet 
calling 
for a forward-looking relationship between the two countries. 
Whether Kim raises the issue of their unhappy historical 
relations at the Japanese emperor's dinner remains to be seen, 
as he wants Japan to settle all pending historical problems. On 
the other hand, Japan will use Kim's visit to push ahead with 
its plan to have Emperor Akihito visit Seoul. 
  In China, Kim will visit the old provisional Korean 
Government building in Shanghai, meet President Jiang Zemin and 
Prime Minister Li Peng and speak at Beijing University. The 
itinerary arranged by Beijing for President Kim is rather 
exceptional in view of China's traditional relationship with 
North Korea, Foreign Ministry officials say.
