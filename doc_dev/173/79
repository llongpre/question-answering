   Sipping sacred rice wine in a shrine to the sun
goddess, Emperor Akihito's youngest son and his college sweetheart
were wed today as millions of Japanese watched on television.
   Flanked by imperial ritualists, Prince Aya, 24, and Kiko
Kawashima, 23, knelt together in the Imperial Palace shrine to the
goddess Amaterasu, from whom legend says the royal family is
descended.
   Miss Kawashima, a graduate student, is the second commoner to
marry into the royal family, and the marriage was seen as another
step in bringing the imperial palace and Japan's people closer
together.
   The ceremony also was being hailed as the public's first taste
of the new imperial era, called Heisei or ``achieving peace,''
which began with the death of Emperor Hirohito on Jan. 7, 1989.
   The new emperor, Akihito, has been credited with trying to
create a more open, softer image for Japan's often distant and
mysterious imperial family.
   Still, much of today's wedding cermony was in line with Japanese
traditions going back more than 1,000 years.
   The prince, speaking the classical Japanese used by priests of
Japan's indigenous Shinto religion, recited vows to the sun
goddess. The couple sealed their nuptial bonds by sipping sacred
rice wine from a white ceramic cup.
   Aya was clad in a black silk robe and cap with an arched
tailpiece signifying his royal rank. The bride wore a green, maroon
and orange kimono, nearly a dozen layers thick and reportedly
weighing 50 pounds.
   The princess' preparations for the wedding, which began before
dawn, included a purification ritual and the coiffing of her hair
in the elaborate court fashion of a thousand years ago.
   Police say that because of threats from leftist radicals, 9,000
officers were assigned to guard the wedding activities, though most
were being held at either the Imperial Palace, which is surrounded
by a moat and forbidding stone walls, or the Akasaka Palace, the
well-secured residence of the emperor and empress.
   The wedding was the first for an imperial family member in six
years, and the first in three decades for a prince of Aya's rank.
Aya is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne after his elder
brother, Crown Prince Naruhito, 30, who has yet to marry.
   Empress Michiko became the first commoner to marry into the
family when she and Akihito, then crown prince, wed in 1959.
   In keeping with tradition, the emperor and empress were absent
from the ceremony at the shrine, but were receiving the couple
later at the palace.
   ``I am praying for their happiness,'' the emperor said in a
statement after the ceremony.
   The princess followed a few steps behind the prince as they
entered the outer sanctuary of the wooden ``Kashikodokoro'' shrine.
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and other government leaders and
imperial family members were among about 150 guests watching from
outside.
   Foreign ambassadors were not invited to the ceremony, but were
to attend a tea party at the palace on Saturday.
   Japan's television networks pre-empted regular programs to carry
the ceremony and related events live.
   Aya was given a new title, Prince Akishino, to mark his
establishing of an independent household. Akishino is the name of a
town in western Japan with close ties to the imperial family.
   ``This is the first big event of the Heisei Era,'' said former
imperial chamberlain Minoru Hamao, who served as a close attendant
to Akihito for 20 years.
   ``The princess is the perfect person for today's imperial
household, and I'm sure that as time goes on she will gradually
help bring the monarchy even closer to the people,'' he said in an
interview.
   Miss Kawashima has won public affection with her warm smile and
quiet manner. Because of her relatively humble background _ her
father is an economics professor at Gakushuin University, a former
peers school _ she was called a modern-day Cinderella.
   She was also dubbed the ``Apartment Princess'' because she lived
with her family in faculty housing on the Gakushuin campus, where
she is working on her masters degree in social psychology.
   ``I feel tense as I think about becoming a member of the
imperial family, and recognize the responsibilities,'' the princess
wrote in a letter carried today by the daily newspaper Asahi
Shimbun.
   She said she wanted to lead ``a happy life with Prince Aya under
the refreshing sky.''
   Aya, a Gakushuin graduate, met Miss Kawashima at a bookstore on
the campus in 1985. Their engagement was approved by the government
in September.
   The royal couple's first trip together will be to the Grand
Shrines of Ise and the tomb of the Emperor Jimmu, both in central
Japan. Emperor Jimmu, according to myth, was Japan's first monarch
and ascended in 660 B.C.
   After the ceremony, the couple went by motorcade from the
Imperial Palace to Akasaka Palace, where they will live near the
emperor and empress. Crowds lined the motorcade's route, and the
new princess, wearing a diamond diamond tiara, smiled and waved.
