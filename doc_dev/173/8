  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko left Tokyo's Haneda airport Friday [10 June] morning for 
Atlanta, Georgia, to begin a 17-day, 11-city visit to the United 
States. 
  The emperor and empress are the first state guests of the 
administration of President Bill Clinton since he took office in 
January 1993. 
  In Atlanta, the emperor and empress will meet former 
President Jimmy Carter and Coretta Scott King, widow of 
assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King, government 
officials said. 
  They will be in Washington for four days from Saturday, and 
will meet President Bill Clinton, lay a wreath at Arlington 
Cemetery and visit an elementary school. 
  Clinton will hold a welcoming ceremony for the imperial 
couple Monday at the White House. 
  The couple will also travel to New York, St. Louis, Longmont 
and Denver in Colorado, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu. 
  In New York, they will meet UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus- Ghali, and in Los Angeles, former U.S. President Ronald 
Reagan. 
  In Honolulu, they will lay a wreath at the National Memorial 
Cemetery of the Pacific but will not visit Pearl Harbor, on 
which Japan launched a devastating attack on Dec. 7, 1941. 
  The government dropped plans for the emperor to visit the 
USS 
Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor under pressure from 
conservative Japanese circles, who fear the emperor would be 
expected to make an apology for the attack that pulled the U.S. 
into World War II. 
  It is the second visit by a Japanese emperor to the U.S. 
Emperor Hirohito, posthumously known as Emperor Showa, made the 
first such visit in 1975. 
  It is also the imperial couple's first U.S. tour since the 
emperor succeeded his deceased father in January 1989, and their 
third official visit to the U.S., which they visited twice as 
crown prince and princess. 
  The couple will return to Tokyo on June 26.
