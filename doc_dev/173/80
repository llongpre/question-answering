   A homemade projectile fired from a car hit near the
home of Emperor Akihito's younger brother Monday and another
missile was found near the imperial garden in Kyoto, police said.
No injuries or damage were reported.
   Police suspected leftist radicals opposed to the monarchy for
the attacks, which took place at about the same time in Tokyo and
Kyoto.
   The attacks came the same day a commission was formed to plan
Akihito's formal coronation, and a day after the end of a one-year
mourning period for his father, Emperor Hirohito.
   Police officials in Tokyo said missiles were fired from a car
parked 650 feet from the western Tokyo residence of Prince Hitachi,
Akihito's younger brother.
   One projectile was found in a road and a fragment, possibly from
a second missile, was discovered in the yard of a private home near
Hitachi's home, said the officials on condition of anonymity. The
projectile contained no explosives, they said.
   Police said there were five launchers in the parked car's trunk.
Kyodo News Service said one exploded in the car, which went up in
flames. Police said they did not know if Hitachi, 54, third in line
to the throne after Akihito's two sons, was home at the time.
   Police said they were investigating who owned the car and
whether it had been stolen. Kyodo said the car had been stolen last
month.
   Kyodo quoted an unidentified woman living nearby as saying she
heard ``five or six booming sounds like fireworks going off. I felt
as though fragments of something were going to come flying toward
our house and was really scared.''
   In the western city of Kyoto, one homemade projectile was found
near the gate of the imperial garden, police said. Witnesses
reported hearing three explosions.
   On Sunday, vandals burned the door of a building at the tomb of
the legendary Emperor Kaika in the western town of Nara, police
said. A note nearby said, ``Nara Red Army. Anti-imperial and
anti-emperor,'' according to police.
   The radical groups oppose Japan's monarchy, despite public
opinion polls showing strong support for it.
   On Monday, the government inaugurated the Imperial Enthronement
Committee, led by Prime Minister Toshiku Kaifu, to plan the
November coronation.
   Although Akihito, 56, became emperor immediately after his
father died on Jan. 7, 1989, coronation plans were delayed by the
one-year mourning period.
   Hirohito died at age 87 after a 62-year reign, longest in
Japanese history.
   Some Japanese are opposed to government plans to spend $58
million on his son's coronation.
   In 1986, Japanese radicals fired homemade missiles at the state
guest house, the U.S. Embassy, the Imperial Palace, Akihito's home
and a police headquarters in Osaka before a summit meeting in Tokyo
of seven major industrialized democracies. One person was injured.
   A car was set afire by a time bomb, reportedly by leftist
radicals, in a parking lot of an Imperial Household Agency
dormitory on April 29, Hirohito's birthday.
