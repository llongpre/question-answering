   Emperor Akihito will be formally enthroned in
November in two ceremonies costing $55.6 million, a government
committee decided Friday.
   The decision was made official during a Cabinet meeting after
the committee, chaired by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, discussed
and approved the ceremony dates, an official at the Prime
Minister's Office said.
   The coronation will be held as a state affair at the Imperial
Palace in Tokyo on Nov. 12, while the ``Daijosai,'' or ``Great Food
Offering Ritual,'' will be conducted according to customs of the
Shinto religion on the evening of Nov. 22 and will last into the
following day.
   Akihito, 56, assumed the Chrysanthemum Throne when his father,
Hirohito, died of cancer at age 87 on Jan. 7, 1989. But he and
other imperial family members avoided holding important ceremonies
and observed a year-long mourning period, thus delaying the
coronation.
   The government has earmarked $55.6 million as expenses for the
two ceremonies in next fiscal year's budget, which starts April 1.
   In the coronation, Akihito will announce his accession to about
2,500 invited dignitaries at the palace.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko will then lead a parade through
Tokyo to announce the coronation and receive blessings from the
people. Four days of banquets are to be held from that evening,
with a total guest list of 3,400.
   In the controversial Daijosai, the new emperor offers freshly
harvested rice to the gods of Shinto, then joins the gods in a
communion and sleeps with the spirit of the sun goddess, according
to the Shinto religion. Shinto is an indigenous faith based on
nature worship, shamanism and elaborate rites.
   The Cabinet has said the Daijosai is ``a public ceremony in
nature,'' but that it will not conduct the rite as a state affair
because that might violate the constitutional separation of state
and religion.
   Some opposition parties, including the Socialists and
Communists, have denounced state funding.
   Under the Constitution, the emperor is a symbolic figurehead.
