  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
was reported in Tokyo and Beijing Wednesday as having said that 
he hopes to hold in-depth discussions on the North Korean 
nuclear problem with the leaders of Japan and China during his 
official visits to the two countries. 
  Kim also said South Korea would support any decision reached 
by the United Nations Security Council on North Korea. 
  Kim made the remarks at a press conference Tuesday for 
Japanese and Chinese correspondents stationed in Seoul as he 
prepared for the visits beginning Thursday. 
  The president noted that the North Korean nuclear issue is 
important to Japan, and that China supported denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula. 
  Kim stressed that the opinions of the three countries are 
basically identical, both Japanese and Chinese press reported 
Wednesday. 
  China's XINHUA news agency quoted Kim as saying he hoped 
that 
his visits to the two countries would serve as a turning point 
in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and in realizing 
peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and unification of 
Korea. 
  Turning to threats by the chief North Korean delegate to the 
inter-Korean contact last Saturday that Seoul will turn into a 
sea of fire if war breaks out, Kim said any North Korean 
provocation would be headed off as South Korea is strong and the 
Seoul-Washington security system is flawless. 
  The president pointed out that North Korea first proposed an 
exchange of special envoys. However, it may not happen any time 
soon as Pyongyang has set various conditions, Kim said. 
  When the North Koreans walked out of the inter-Korean 
working-level contact last Saturday, the rupture was intentional 
since their chief delegate read a statement from a prepared 
text, Kim told interviewers. 
  Aside from the nuclear issue, Kim said economic cooperation 
and development of trade ties between Seoul and Tokyo and Seoul 
and Beijing will top the agenda during his visits. 
  In particular, Kim said he hoped economic relations with 
China will develop further as a result of his Beijing visit, 
noting that the two countries are already conducting exchanges 
in every field. 
  The president said he is convinced that Seoul-Beijing 
cooperation will contribute greatly to the peace and stability 
of the Northeast Asian region. 
  With regard to Japanese Emperor Akihito coming to Seoul, Kim 
said this would occur when mutual understanding deepened and the 
Korean and Japanese people accepted it. Kim thus hinted that 
Akihito could visit Seoul during his term in office.
