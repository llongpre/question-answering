<HEAD>Britons Protest Philip's Attendance At Hirohito Funeral</HEAD>

   The announcement Monday that Prince Philip will
represent his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, at the funeral of Emperor
Hirohito of Japan brought angry protests from lawmakers and World
War II veterans.
   Buckingham Palace announced that Philip, who served in the Far
East during the war and was present at the Japanese surrender in
Tokyo Bay, would attend the Feb. 24 services in Tokyo for Hirohito,
who died Jan. 7 at the age of 87 after 62 years on the throne.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe will represent Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government.
   Conservative lawmaker Terry Dicks urged the prince to resign as
president of the Burma Star Association, the organization of Far
East war veterans, some of whom urged the royal family to boycott
the services. Dicks said whoever made the decision to send him
``should be shot.''
   The queen, who does not attend the funerals of heads of state,
acts on the advice of government ministers on such issues as sending
representatives.
   Harold Payne, president of the National Federation of Far Eastern
Prisoners-of-War Associations, said he was ``deeply saddened'' by
the decision.
   Opposition Labor Party lawmaker Ron Brown, who described Hirohito
as ``a war criminal of the worst kind,'' called for a nationwide
campaign to change the decision.
   ``It is a grave insult to many people who were enslaved, tortured
and killed by the Japanese during the last war,'' he said.
   But David Owen, leader of the moderate Social Democratic and
Labor Party, described the choice of the Duke of Edinburgh as
``imaginative, correct and courageous.''
   Conservative lawmaker Ivor Stanbrook also applauded the decision.
``The proper time to consider relations with the emperor of Japan
was when we invited him here in 1971 as an honored guest on a state
visit,'' he said.
   Critics say the presence of a member of the British royal family
would dignify a monarch who oversaw Japan's militaristic regime
during World War II and its harsh treatment of prisoners.
   About 27,000 British prisoners died at the hands of the Japanese
in the 1939-1945 war, and many survivors regard him as a war
criminal.
   Historians generally agree that Hirohito was a figurehead who
lacked power to do anything but approve decisions of military
leaders.
   Hirohito visted Britain in 1971, and the queen made an official
return visit in 1975.
   A 1986 visit to Japan by Prince Charles and his wife, Princess
Diana, played a significant role in smoothing postwar relations
between Britain and Japan.
   The queen, Charles and Diana have sent messages of condolence to
the new emperor, Akihito, and the dowager empress.
