<LEADPARA>  (check) Isabel McIlvain, the sculptor of the bronze JFK statue unveiled on the
Boston Statehouse lawn a year ago, said she still is owed more than $40,000 on
that large item. The John F. Kennedy Memorial Commission, which ordered the
work, assures us that it is not welshing but is undergoing some cash flow
problems.;    (check) Bob Hope celebrated his 88th birthday this week with a
game of golf and a small family party in L.A. This is unusual for that
globe-trotter. Only two years ago, Hope celebrated by directing traffic on a
freeway off-ramp near a suburban Burbank street that was named in his honor.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (check) Word from Tokyo is that Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko will
tour Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia in September in what will be the first
visit by a Japanese emperor to other Asian nations. Akihito's tour is to begin
Sept. 26 and last about 10 days.;    (check) Walt Disney Co. and the voice of
"Sleeping Beauty" reached an out-of-court settlement Friday in West Palm
Beach, Fla. The voice's owner, Mary Costa, had sued for $2 million in
videocassette royalties and the case was about to go to trial. No one will say
how much money changed hands.;    (check) Hospital spokesman Mike Byrne told
reporters Friday that Richard Pryor was cracking jokes two days after his
triple heart bypass surgery at UCLA Medical Center. Doctors said Pryor
probably will leave the hospital Tuesday. He went in for surgery Wednesday
after experiencing chest pains.;    (check) "The Babe," starring John Goodman
as the Sultan of Swat and Kelly McGillis as his wife, started shooting this
week in Chicago, a town that struck the film makers as more 1920s than the Big
Apple. Action shots will be at Wrigley Field.;    (check) Today's quote comes
from a Prague pool attendant who caught Princess Diana taking time out from
her royal visit for an unauthorized dip. "Get out!" he ordered. "That lane is
for training only!"  </TEXT>
