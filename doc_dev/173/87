   Kiko Kawashima, a college graduate student,
accepted gifts from the imperial palace today, formally sealing her
engagement to Emperor Akihito's son, Prince Aya.
   ``I humbly state my acceptance,'' Miss Kawashima, wearing a pink
kimono and gold sash, said as imperial chamberlain Yasuo Shigeta
presented her with a list of the gifts.
   The gifts _ two large fish placed face to face, six bottles of
rice wine and three bolts of silken cloth _ had been taken to the
Kawashima residence and carefully arranged on separate tables
before Shigeta's arrival.
   Miss Kawashima and Prince Aya, who is second in line to the
throne after his elder brother, are to be married in late June, and
the government plans to spend about $1 million for the lavish
ceremony and receptions afterward.
   It will be the first royal marriage since 1984, and is expected
to be a welcome respite after a year of mourning Emperor Hirohito's
death last January.
   Today's ceremony, which lasted less than one hour, was to be
followed later in the day by courtesy calls on the emperor, Empress
Michiko and Aya by top government officials, including heads of the
legislature and Supreme Court.
   Shigeta, clad in a black morning coat and carrying a silk top
hat, arrived at the Kawashima in a limousine.
   As more than 100 photographers and reporters watched from a
narrow street below, the graying chamberlain climbed four flights
of outdoor stairs to the Kawashima apartment on the campus of
Gakushuin University, where Miss Kawashima's father teaches
economics.
   Aya and Miss Kawashima, who is studying pyschology, first met at
the university in 1985. Aya, 24, is to complete postgraduate
studies in zoology at Oxford in early June. He is to return to
England on Sunday.
   Shigeta was received in the guest room of the four-room
apartment by Miss Kawashima and her father, Tatsuhiko, and mother,
Kazuyo. Because of her commoner background, Miss Kawashima, 23, has
been nicknamed the Apartment Princess.
   In early February, Miss Kawashima will begin her ``princess
education,'' a series of classes in poetry, the constitution,
history and imperial traditions that will last several months.
   It is common in Japan for a prospective groom to present his
fiance and her family with betrothal presents prior to marriage.
   Though the presents themselves are not extravagant, they have
symbolic significance. For instance, the name of the fish, ``tai,''
recalls the Japanese word for congratulations, ``medetai.''
   More than 1,000 officers were mobilized by the Metropolitan
Police Department to secure the area around the Kawashima residence
from attack by radicals.
   On Monday, a projectile struck the home of Emperor Akihito's
brother, Prince Hitachi, leaving a hole in its roof. No injuries
were reported, but police have stepped up measures to protect
imperial family members.
   The ultra-leftist Middle Core Faction claimed responsibility for
the attack Monday, and vowed to step up its anti-monarchy activity
in the coming months.
   Aya's brother, Crown Prince Naruhito, turns 30 next month and is
reportedly having trouble finding a woman to his liking who is both
suitable and willing to become Japan's next empress.
