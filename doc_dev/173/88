   Emperor Hirohito, once venerated as a living god and
made into the guiding spirit of a world war, today died of
intestinal cancer, ending a 62-year reign that saw his nation
recover from ruin to riches. He was 87.
   Crown Prince Akihito, oldest of the emperor's two sons, became
the 125th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne. In a solemn,
wordless four-minute ceremony, a sword, jewels and the imperial
seals were placed on a table in front of him, and he bowed.
   Hirohito died without ever having shed much light on his World
War II role.
   Historians generally agree he was a figurehead who was required
to approve decisions of the military leaders, until he decided the
Japanese had suffered enough _ atomic bombing, firebombing and
invasion _ and personally announced surrender in August 1945.
   His death followed a 3{-month illness during which reports on his
blood pressure and temperature became fixtures of Japanese routine
and many festivities were postponed or canceled.
   The government proclaimed a six-day formal mourning period and
named the new emperor's reign Heisei, or Achieving Peace. Hirohito's
reign, which began on Dec. 25, 1926, was called Showa, or
Enlightened Peace.
   Thousands of people signed condolence registers at the palace.
Japan's stock markets closed, but banks and many shops remained open.
   Some clerks wore black ribbons to signify mourning but, prepared
by the monarch's long illness, people generally reacted calmly.
   In western Japan, however, an 87-year-old man hanged himself
today, leaving a note that said in part, ``I want to follow the
emperor in death,'' police said.
   Kyodo News Service said Umanosuke Ue, a former Imperial Army
soldier, had been particularly proud of having been born in the same
year as the emperor.
   In western Tokyo, police arrested 10 members of the radical
leftist Chukakuha (Middle Core Faction) on charges of assembling
weapons for a demonstration against the nation's monarchy.
   About 100 faction members tried to demonstrate, and ``some of
those arrested tried to push through with bamboo rods against riot
police,'' said a police spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said 15,000 riot police were being mobilized around Tokyo
against possible sabotage.
   About 90 people peacefully marched in another Tokyo district with
banners bearing such slogans as ``No more emperor'' and suggesting
Hirohito bore responsibility for the war.
   ``I could not stand the thought that people outside Japan are
going to think ... everyone is crying over his death,'' said
organizer Ryuichi Harada. ``It is about time we should learn that
the image of him being a pacifist and warm and kind old man was
forced on us.''
   The formal state funeral is planned for Feb. 24, Kyodo news
service reported, quoting government sources. There was no immediate
government announcement.
   Until Hirohito's death, palace officials refused to acknowledge
that the emperor was suffering from cancer. Japanese rarely inform
cancer patients of their disease.
   After fell seriously ill on Sept. 19, 67.8 pints of blood
transfusions helped keep Hirohito alive.
   In September 1987, Hirohito had undergone intestinal bypass
surgery, but doctors had said that a growth found there was not
cancerous.
   ``With heartfelt sorrow, I, together with our people, wish to
express my deep sense of loss on the passing,'' Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita said in a television address.
   Takeshita recounted Hirohito's ``eventful and turbulent'' reign,
through the Depression and ``the calamities of that deplorable war''
to unprecedented postwar economic growth.
   ``He resolutely brought to an end the war that had broken out in
spite of his wishes, out of a determination to prevent further
suffering of the people,'' said Takeshita.
   In Washington, President Reagan joined leaders worldwide in
offering condolences. Reagan lauded Hirohito for playing ``a truly
heroic role'' in urging his country to surrender.
   Reaction to his death, however, was muted in South Korea, ruled
harshly as a colony during 20 years of Hirohito's rule, and by some
Chinese who held Hirohito accountable for the Japanese invasion of
China in World War II.
   Hirohito died in the moat-ringed palace where he had stayed most
of the time, a remote figure who was known, however, as an eminent
marine biologist and avid fan of sumo, a traditional Japanese form
of wrestling.
   Hirohito wrote 12 books on hydrozoans, small sea animals.
   The world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same family since
at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 B.C. _ passed
automatically to Akihito.
   If tradition is followed, there will be more than 60 different
ceremonies over the next two years until Akihito is formally
enthroned.
   Akihito, 55, was schooled among commoners and, in an upset to
precedent, married a commoner.
   With Princess Michiko becoming the new empress, Hirohito's wife,
Nagako, 85, becomes empress dowager.
   The new crown prince, Akihito's eldest son Naruhito, 28, formerly
known as Prince Hiro, also is a tennis player, and studied at Oxford
University in England.
   Akihito has indicated he would lower some of the walls around the
monarchy, and he once reportedly told a friend, ``I want to shake up
the imperial protocol system.''
