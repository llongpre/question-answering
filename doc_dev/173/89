   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today he will
apologize for Japan's wartime aggression when he meets South
Korea's president next week, but the government is less willing to
have the emperor make a similar statement.
   ``I think I should express frank regret about our mistakes in
the past and apologize for them,'' Kaifu told Parliament. He was
responding to an opposition question about news reports that South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo expects an apology from Emperor
Akihito.
   Kaifu did not comment on whether the emperor would make an
apology during Roh's three-day trip to Japan, which begins May 24.
   Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 to 1945, and Koreans
have bitter memories of harsh treatment under the Japanese, along
with the legacy of their country's division since the war's end.
   Leaders of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party expressed
strong opposition to a royal apology.
   ``We should not use the emperor for political purposes,'' Ichiro
Ozawa, secretary general of the party, told a news conference.
   The matter is delicate for the Japanese, touching on the nature
of the emperor's role under the postwar constitution and recalling
unresolved questions about how much responsibility the late Emperor
Hirohito had for Japan's wartime actions.
   Six years ago, Hirohito told then South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan that he sincerely regretted the unfortunate past between
the two countries.
   Japanese media quoted Roh Monday as saying Korea was unsure
whether Hirohito's statement was an apology or not, and that he
expected a definite apology from Emperor Akihito.
   Akihito succeeded to the throne after Hirohito died in January
1989.
   Roh said it was clear from history which country had been the
aggressor and which had been the victim, and that Japan and Korea
needed to have a proper understanding of history to be able to
cooperate in the future, news reports added.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said the wording of
what the emperor would say had not yet been decided. He stressed
that while the constitution prevents the emperor from taking a role
in politics or government, the prime minister would speak
``sincerely and honestly'' about the past.
   Watanabe said he was confident the situation would improve and
Japan and South Korea could move toward greater cooperation. He
indicated that Roh's visit would be used to announce new joint
projects between the two countries.
   He declined to give details but said there would be cooperation
in the areas of technology, culture and exchange visits.
