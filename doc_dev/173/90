   The condition of Japan's ailing Emperor Hirohito
took a turn for the worse Sunday while his son presided over New
Year's ceremonies at the imperial palace.
   The 87-year-old monarch, who has been bed-ridden since he first
hemorrhaged Sept. 19, lost a ``substantial amount'' of blood through
his bowels and needed a transfusion of 0.9 pints, palace officials
said.
   Hirohito received 0.4 pints of blood on Saturday. Combined with
the latest transfusion Sunday, Hirohito has been given a total of
more than 64 pints of blood since he fell ill.
   The emperor was also running a slight fever of 98.8 degrees
Sunday, up from 97.3 the previous night, a palace official said on
condition of anonymity.
   His systolic, or upper, blood pressure reading dropped to 76
Sunday from Saturday evening's level of 106.
   The systolic reading, usually averaging 120 for a healthy person,
indicates the pressure of the blood against artery walls when the
heart is beating. Doctors say a sustained reading under 100 can lead
to brain damage.
   The emperor missed for the first time the annual New Year's
ceremony on Sunday.
   Crown Prince Akihito, 56, the emperor's elder son and heir to the
throne, officiated at the event attended by imperial family
relatives, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Cabinet ministers,
regional governors and other leading government officials.
   Hirohito marked the beginning of his 63rd year as emperor on Dec.
25, anniversary of the death of his father, Emperor Meiji. Hirohito
is the longest reigning monarch in the world.
   Under the post-World War II constitution, Japan's emperor holds
only symbolic power.
