Japan's Emperor Akihito will formally ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne next 
Monday in an ancient rite to be witnessed by Vice President Dan Quayle and 
dignitaries from 156 other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito technically became emperor in January, 1989, upon the death of his 
father, Hirohito. But Monday's ceremony is part of an ancient set of rites that 
celebrate the new emperor and the nation following a period of official 
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
A second, deeply religious and controversial Shinto rite enthronement ceremony 
closed to foreigners is to follow on Nov. 22.
