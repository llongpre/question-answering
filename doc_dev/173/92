   Emperor Hirohito, at 87 the world's longest
reigning monarch, received a blood transfusion after vomiting blood
and was in stable condition at the Imperial Palace on Tuesday,
palace officials and news reports said.
   But the respected Kyodo news agency, citing unidentified
``government sources,'' said at midday that the emperor appeared to
be in critical condition. Officials would not confirm the report.
   The government decided Tuesday to place Crown Prince Akihito,
54, the emperor's eldest son, in charge of all matters of state
until the emperor recovers, Defense Agency head Kichiro Tazawa said.
   Tazawa told reporters after a regular Cabinet meeting that the
Cabinet was expected to formally approve the appointment Thursday.
   Kyodo said the government was considering whether to advise
Cabinet members to remain at their offices and not leave Tokyo.
   The emperor's death would plunge Japan into official mourning,
for which there would be no modern precedent. Hirohito has been on
the throne since 1926, and older Japanese who grew up when he was
considered divine revere him greatly. Those born after World War II
tend to have less interest in the emperor, who renounced his
divinity after the war.
   Court physicians were summoned to the palace in central Tokyo
after the emperor vomited blood shortly before 10 p.m. (9 a.m. EDT)
Monday and they gave him a blood transfusion for four hours
beginning at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, the imperial official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The doctors ruled out hospitalizing the aged emperor.
   Television and news service reports said Hirohito received 1.7
pints of blood during the transfusion and was fully conscious
during the treatment.
   Following the transfusion, the emperor's temperature fell to
about 98.6 degrees and his pulse was a normal 90 beats per minute,
according to the imperial official.
   After two consecutive days of fever, Hirohito's condition grew
worse late Monday. Imperial officials said court phsycians found
traces of jaundice in his blood and would perform minor surgery if
the fever continued.
   Hirohito suffered a 100.4 degree fever Sunday.
   Almost one year ago on Sept. 22, the emperor underwent an
intestinal operation, and doctors found a hard, egg-size
enlargement of the pancreas, which blocked the duodenum. Surgeons
did not remove the blockage but performed a bypass around it.
   In recent weeks the emperor has suffered a cold, according to
the imperial agency, and news reports last week said he has lost 20
pounds from his weight of 130 pounds before his surgery last year.
   Akihito, heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne that Hirohito has held
since Christmas Day 1926, and Crown Princess Michiko came to the
palace Tuesday morning. Nationally broadcast television reports
showed limousines bearing members of the imperial family arriving
at the palace to pay their respects.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita visited early Tuesday to sign
his name on a list of well-wishers, according to television reports.
