   The Cabinet today temporarily passed the imperial
mantle to Crown Prince Akihito as Japan fretted over the failing
health of Emperor Hirohito, the world's longest reigning monarch.
   Officials of the Imperial Household Agency, which runs palace
affairs, set up booths today around the country and allowed people
to sign their names in books for the emperor.
   Crowds have gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in central
Toyko since Hirohito took to bed with intestinal hemorrhaging four
days ago. Palace officials said today that he remained in serious
but stable condition.
   ``I felt like my grandfather was dying,'' Aya Kitade, a
22-year-old college student, said Wednesday at the palace.
   She came from Kyoto, 230 miles away, after her grandparents
asked her to visit and convey their greetings to the emperor.
   Across Japan, Shinto shrines held services to pray for the
emperor.
   Many older people still hold Hirohito in high regard, but
younger Japanese typically give him little thought. A minority
strongly opposes the imperial system, charging it represents the
strongly centralized state control and militarism that
characterized wartime Japan.
   The United States forced the emperor, who has occupied the
throne since 1926, to publicly renounce his claim to divinity after
World War II. He remains a symbol of Japan without wielding any
real power.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi said the Cabinet met today
and agreed to put 54-year-old Akihito temporarily in charge of all
imperial duties.
   ``Taking into consideration the emperor's illness and medical
treatment, we have asked the crown prince to temporarily assume
responsibilities,'' Obuchi said in a nationally televised press
conference.
   Government officials said Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno will not
leave for Washington today for talks with Secretary of State George
P. Shultz. They said that in view of ``domestic circumstances,''
they had also postponed upcoming visits to Japan by Prime Minister
Ciriaco De Mita of Italy on Sunday and by Irish leader Charles J.
Haughey on Wednesday.
   One year ago, when Hirohito underwent an intestinal bypass
operation, the prince took charge of all duties for three months.
In December, Hirohito resumed most of his imperial duties.
   The emperor's health problem began late Monday, when he vomited
blood. The hemorraging is related to an inflamed pancreas.
   Palace officials, widely quoted in press reports, said the
emperor on Wednesday requested food and a television to watch his
favorite sport, sumo wrestling. The emperor is known as shy man
especially fond of his work as a published marine biologist.
