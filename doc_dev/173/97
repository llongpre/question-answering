   Akihito, who becomes Japan's first emperor to ascend
the Chrysanthemum Throne as a human and not a living god, has
quietly transformed the cloistered monarchy into a popular symbol of
the people.
   The gray-haired Akihito has waited 55 years to take up the
imperial mantle. A gracious, self-effacing man schooled among
commoners, he has spent those years maturing with his country.
   As Hirohito lay dying, the prince assumed the full roster of the
emperor's official duties on Sept. 22.
   The prince's daily shuttles from his residence near the forested
imperial compound to Hirohito's deathbed drew swarms of
photographers. Whether in predawn darkness or afternoon drizzle,
Akihito's face showed the same stoic deference to the ailing
monarch, and court physicians listening outside the imperial chamber
reported quiet conversations between father and son.
   Akihito took on the imperial duties once before as Hirohito
recuperated from intestinal bypass surgery in September 1987. He
retained a few responsibilities but returned most after the
emperor's recovery. Those duties include affixing the imperial seal
to government laws and appointments, opening sessions of parliament
and receiving foreign ambassadors.
   To these the prince has added frequent visits to factory
openings, festivals and various observances across Japan. And with
numerous trips abroad as his father's proxy, he has almost
single-handedly brought Japan's monarchy into the global age and the
eye of a curious public.
   ``I want to be a man with a strong moral backbone with keen,
reliable insight and knowledge,'' he once reportedly told a friend.
``I want to shake up the imperial protocol system.''
   Akihito set his most spectacular imperial precedent with his
marriage in 1959 to a commoner. Michiko Shoda was the beautiful,
cultured daughter of a wealthy miller, and the young prince courted
her by phone in a widely reported romance that was conservative, but
refreshingly typical.
   The match shocked the imperial retinue and thrilled the public.
Hirohito gave his consent and the couple married after a cavalcade
that drew 500,000 gawking subjects onto the streets of Tokyo.
   Akihito and his princess produced three children: Prince Hiro,
who at 28 is next in the imperial succession; Prince Aya, 22, and
19-year-old Princess Nori. They broke another imperial tradition
with their decision to raise the children by themselves.
   Born Dec. 23, 1933, as a militaristic Japan geared for growing
confrontation in Asia and the Pacific, Akihito was shuttled among
the imperial family's countryside villas when American planes began
firebombing Tokyo in the closing months of the war. He was still
short of his 12th birthday when his father's armies were crushed and
the nation suffered the ultimate defeat in 1945.
   At the urging of U.S. occupation officials, Hirohito also
surrendered the divinity that had been the birthright of every
Japanese monarch, and agreed to a new constitutional role as ``the
symbol of the state and of the unity of the people, deriving his
position from the will of the people.''
   Akihito took his role seriously. ``The imperial family should
always be passive,'' he has said. ``The most important thing is the
will of the people.''
   Having inherited a centuries-old legacy of passive monarchs, his
job may have been made easier. The prince, who was invested as heir
to the throne in an unprecedented public ceremony in 1952, soon set
off to represent his father on state visits around the globe,
including the coronation of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.
   With Michiko he has visited at least 41 countries in 22 official
trips to ``deepen understanding mutually and promote friendship
between the peoples,'' he has said.
   Akihito shares his father's proclivity for science and is a
respected scholar of gobiid fish, a mudsucker. He holds membership
in the Ichthyological Society of Japan and the Linnean Society of
London.
   ``He wants the imperial family to remain a cultural symbol of the
nation,'' his longtime chamberlain, Yasuo Shigeta, told The
Associated Press, and has encouraged his children to take up
specialties.
   He sent his first-born to study at Britain's Oxford University,
explaining, ``If (Hiro) remains in the country, he cannot know even
what the common people routinely experience.''
   ``As a matter of fact, I rode a bus for the first time when I
went to London.''
   Akihito speaks fluent English and has acted as his father's
interpreter in meetings with foreign dignitaries. He inherited his
mother's tutor, Elizabeth Vining, a Quaker from the United States.
   Mrs. Vining recalled once asking her youthful pupil what he
wanted to be when he grew up. Replied the prince, ``I will become
emperor.''
   Recent polls show his subjects welcome the career choice. A
nationwide newspaper poll in 1987 showed more than 80 percent of the
public wants to keep the imperial system.
