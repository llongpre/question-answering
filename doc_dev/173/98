Photo, Commoner's Touch: Prince Aya, 24, youngest son of Japanese Emperor 
Akihito, wed his college sweetheart, Kiko Kawashima, 23, in Shinto rites in 
Tokyo. Solemn, 15-minute ceremony at shrine dedicated to sun goddess Amaterasu 
marked only the second marriage of a commoner into imperial family. First was 
when Empress Michiko wed Akihito, then crown prince, in 1959. Aya is second in 
line to Chrysanthemum Throne after his elder brother, Crown Prince Naruhito, 
30, who has yet to marry. He will now be known as Prince Akishino, after a town 
in western Japan. His bride is working on a master's degree in social 
psychology at Gakushuin University, where the couple met. Associated Press
