   Gerber Products Co. chose as its new top officer the executive who helped Entenmann's Inc. grow into a nationally recognized baked-goods company. 

   Gerber said it named David W. Johnson, 55 years old, as chairman, president and chief executive officer of the baby-food maker. 
Mr. Johnson, currently a General Foods Corp. vice president, is also president and chief executive officer of that company's Entenmann's subsidiary. 
Mr. Johnson is scheduled to take over at Freemont, Mich.-based Gerber by Oct. 19. 

   The appointment was welcomed by Wall Street analysts, who viewed it as possibly signaling a return of stability to Gerber management and speeding the company's financial turnaround, perhaps through a return to the core foods business. 

   At Gerber, Mr. Johnson succeeds the late Leo D. Goulet, who died in July at age 61 after an apparent heart attack. 
The uncertainty following Mr. Goulet's death had fueled long-standing rumors that management turmoil and weak earnings might make Gerber vulnerable to a hostile takeover bid, driving up the company's stock price. 

   Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Gerber fell $2, to close at $49.625 a share, amid a broad decline in the market. 

   Mr. Goulet had been chief executive for only six weeks before his death. 
He had succeeded William L. McKinley, 63, who took early retirement. 
Analysts have suggested Mr. McKinley was forced out because of shareholder dissatisfaction with the company's performance. 
Gerber's profit for the year ended March 31 fell 20% from a year earlier to $36.4 million. 

   "The company had been adrift without a sail," said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, New York. 
"But I'm pleased they could name such a very qualified person in so relatively short a time. 
This should add stability and mollify some takeover rumors." 

   Mr. McMillin added that Mr. Johnson joins Gerber at a good time, because the company seems to be turning around. 
Fiscal first-quarter net income rose 28% to $8 million, or 41 cents a share, from $6.6 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. 

   Mr. Johnson, he said, will be in a position to accelerate that trend, "particularly if he divests those low-return businesses which don't make sense, like furniture, insurance and child-care centers." 
Mr. McMillin said Mr. Johnson's strong food-industry background makes it likely that he'll return Gerber to its core food business. 

   Mr. Johnson couldn't be reached for comment but Gerber issued a statement in Mr. Johnson's name indicating that he may do just that. 
"My initial mission will be a thorough review of our various businesses, building on our strengths, and reviewing our strategy on every segment of the business" to meet company and shareholder standards for high profitabilty, the statement said. 

   For the past eight years, Mr. Johnson has headed Entenmann's, which was acquired by General Foods from Warner-Lambert Co. in 1982. 
During his tenure at Entenmann's, the unit went from being an Eastern, regional baking concern to a national marketer with sales that increased fourfold.
