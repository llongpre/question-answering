Ever since the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, American
financial markets have always paid tribute to the death of heads of state by
shutting up shop.
But in closing down for an entire session to mark the passing of Richard
Nixon, the New York Stock Exchange has ruffled a few feathers - and not
solely because people feel that Nixon, the only US president to resign in
disgrace, might merit something less than the full treatment.
At least two other exchanges, Nasdaq and the Pacific Stock Exchange,
unabashedly say they would have preferred to remain open but were forced to
follow the Big Board's lead for technical reasons only.
Wall Streeters were also quick to point out the damage that unscheduled
closings could inflict on the New York market's efforts to fend off its
competitors from overseas.
In deciding to close for the full session, the exchange is indeed affording
Nixon an honour denied another president 30 years ago.
In 1964, trading was suspended for only half the day after Herbert Hoover
died.
But then Hoover just happened to be in the White House in 1929, the year of
the mother of all stock market crashes.
