   A suspected Irish Republican Army
terrorist bragged that the group's next target would be British
helicopters once it had control of a Stinger anti-aircraft missile,
according to court papers.
   Kevin McKinley, who also allegedly told federal undercover
agents that his group was responsible for a 1984 assassination
attempt against British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other
bombings, was arrested Friday in a Palm Beach parking lot as he
tried to wedge a 5-foot Stinger missile in his car. Three other men
were also arrested.
   The four remained in prison today after a bail hearing was
postponed until Friday at the request of both sides.
   ``All have a viable defense and it will be pursued to the
highest degree,'' said Roger Colton, a lawyer for McKinley, 33;
Seamus Moley, 30 and Joseph McColgan, 39, all Irish citizens.
   Colton would not give details of a possible defense but said
entrapment is ``a possible avenue.''
   Co-defendant Sean McCann, 34, a Canadian, was represented by
attorney Michael Salnick.
   Agents posing as arms dealers arrested the men shortly after
Moley handed over $47,500 for a hand-held Stinger missile and
McKinley was taken to a West Palm Beach warehouse to inspect the
weapon, authorities said.
   Agents had planned to follow McKinley from the warehouse, but he
was arrested on the spot after he discovered the Stinger did not
fit in his car, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
said Tuesday. The three other men were arrested in North Palm
Beach, about 65 miles north of Miami.
   The Stinger, which weighs about 35 pounds, is used to launch a
single surface-to-air missile. The weapon was on loan from the
Marines and had no warhead.
   McKinley said the Stinger was to be used by the provisional wing
of the IRA against British helicopters in Northern Ireland,
according to court papers filed by Customs and ATF.
   McKinley also told agents ``his people'' were responsible for a
1984 bombing of a hotel in Brighton, England. The IRA claimed
responsibility for the bombing, which killed five people, including
two senior Conservative Party figures. Mrs. Thatcher escaped
unharmed.
   During several meetings from Nov. 20 to Jan. 12, the suspects
also said they were seeking .50-caliber rifles, C-4 explosives and
grenade launchers. All are charged with violations of the Arms
Export Control Act and Neutrality Law and other weapons violations.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Barbara Patras said they each could
receive up to 30 years in prison and $1.25 million in fines if
convicted.
   The IRA, a mainly Roman Catholic guerrilla group outlawed in
Britain and Ireland, is fighting to end British rule over Northern
Ireland and unite it with the Irish Republic.
