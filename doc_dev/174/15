   Danaher Corp., which agreed to sell its Mohawk Rubber Co. unit to McKinley Allsopp Inc., said McKinley notified Danaher that it is unable to obtain financing for the leveraged buy-out valued at $70 million. 

   The Washington-based maker of automotive and transportation products said the agreement hasn't been terminated, but indicated "there can be no assurance that the transaction" will be completed under the previously announced terms. 
Danaher said it intends to pursue, among other things, alternative transactions involving Mohawk. 

   In November, Danaher agreed to sell its Akron, Ohio-based tire maker to McKinley Allsopp, a unit of Merchants Capital Corp., a Boston-based holding company. 
Under those terms, McKinley agreed to pay about $67 million in cash and $3 million of preferred stock. 

   Mohawk was to be sold to Radial Acquisition Corp., a corporation organized by McKinley Allsopp. 
In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. 
Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. 

   McKinley Allsopp couldn't be reached for comment.
