Will Bradley, a handsome, urbane studio trombonist who emerged from those 
anonymous ranks to lead what briefly was one of the most celebrated Big Bands 
of the early and mid-1940s, has died. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported Thursday that Bradley, noted for such popular 
hits of the day as "Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar," "Celery Stalks at 
Midnight" and "Strange Cargo," died Saturday in Flemington, N.J. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
With drummer Ray McKinley, whom Bradley lured from Jimmy Dorsey, the Will 
Bradley Band was a mainstay of ballrooms and hotels during the wartime years of 
sentimental ballads, jive tunes and boogie-woogie. 
</P>
<P>
Called by Glenn Miller "the best of all" the trombonists of his day, Wilbur 
Schwichtenberg had worked for years in recording studios before emerging to 
join the old Milt Shaw and Ray Noble bands (Miller was a fellow trombonist with 
Noble). In 1939 Schwichtenberg became Bradley and Wilbur became Will and he and 
McKinley (considered a co-leader although he sat at the back of the band) 
produced a series of sweet ballads and swing tunes for Columbia records. 
</P>
<P>
With Freddie Slack at the piano the Bradley band recorded "I Don't Stand a 
Ghost of a Chance," with Carlotta Dale on vocal, and "Old Doc Yak," with 
McKinley singing and playing drums. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Tobin, then Harry James' wife, sang "Deed I Do" with Bradley shortly 
before the band switched emphasis from ballads to boogie. 
</P>
<P>
Slack, later to form his own famous band, was the catalyst behind a white group 
of musicians playing what had been a black innovation. 
</P>
<P>
In George T. Simons' book "The Big Bands," McKinley recounts how the musicians 
were experimenting with instrumental arrangements based on the blues with an 
eight-to-the-bar piano boogie beat. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one point where I had a drum break and for some reason or other that 
night instead of playing the break, I sang out "Oh, beat me, daddy, eight to 
the bar!" After the set McKinley encouraged the writing of a song with that 
title and it became the biggest of the Bradley band's hits, selling more than 
100,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley tried to chase that success with "Rock-a-Bye Boogie," "Scrub Me, Mama, 
With a Boogie Beat," "Fry Me, Cookie, With a Can of Lard" and others. 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly became disenchanted with the band's new sound, preferring the 
more solid tunes of the day, and he and McKinley eventually split up, McKinley 
to form his own group in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley brought new talent into his band after McKinley's departure, among them 
a young drummer named Shelley Manne and a trumpet player who called himself 
Shorty Rogers. These two were to become an integral part of modern jazz a few 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
But the wartime military draft decimated the ranks of the younger players and 
Simon writes of one engagement in Detroit in which Bradley told him that six 
musicians moved from the bandstand to the recruiting station in a single week. 
</P>
<P>
After that Bradley was forced to cancel many of his personal appearances and 
rely on studio musicians for recordings. Bradley himself soon returned to the 
studios where he had started. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Joan, a son, a daughter and a grandson.
