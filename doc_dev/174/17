   ATLANTA -- Bank South Corp. tapped two senior executives
of C&amp;S/Sovran Corp. on the eve of a reported merger agreement
between C&amp;S/Sovran and NCNB Corp.
   Patrick L. Flinn was named president and chief executive
officer of Bank South. Mr. Flinn, 49 years old, had been
group executive vice president in charge of real estate and
mortgage banking for C&amp;S/Sovran in the Washington, D.C.,
region.

   Mr. Flinn had been with C&amp;S/Sovran and its predecessor
company, Citizens &amp; Southern Corp., for 25 years. Mr. Flinn
succeeds Robert P. Guyton as chief executive officer. Mr.
Guyton resigned in June under pressure from the board.
   John E. McKinley was named senior executive vice president
and chief credit officer of Bank South. Mr. McKinley, 47, was
C&amp;S/Sovran's group executive vice president and chief credit
officer in corporate banking. He had been with C&amp;S for 22
years.
   Mr. McKinley succeeds C. Arnold Johnson as senior credit
officer; Mr. Johnson resigned in April. However, Mr.
McKinley, who will be second in command under Mr. Flinn, will
have a wider range of responsibilities in the post, Bank
South said.
   "These are two heavy hitters," said Bo Spalding, senior
vice president of Bank South and head of corporate
communications. "Everyone here is delighted to have gotten
them." Both men assume their new jobs Aug. 1.
   Bank South, which has been hammered by large loan losses,
has seen turmoil in senior management recently, including the
exodus of four senior officers. Last week, it reported a
second-quarter net loss of $16.3 million, or 47 cents a
share, and suspended its common stock dividend.
