<DESCRIPT>  NEW-YORK; MUSIC; THEATER; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE American musical theater takes a bold leap into dark ground with Stephen
Sondheim's new musical, "Assassins," which opened Sunday at the 139-seat
Playwrights Horizons on West 42nd Street's Theater Row.;    At first sitting,
at least, the tabloid-sized show about presidential assassins and the society
that produced them looks like a small masterpiece of political theater. It is
pungent with satirical irony, grotesquely funny at times and consistently
disturbing.  </LEADPARA>

'ASSASSINS' IS NEW YORK'S HOTTEST TICKET  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     For musical inspiration, Sondheim has relied largely on American forms --
folk ballads and traditional marches. A balladeer in overalls (Patrick
Cassidy) is the narrator. The music is simpler than Sondheim's last two scores
("Into the Woods," "Sunday in the Park With George") and likely to disappoint
the composer's more fervent fans.;    A hot ticket;    A new Sondheim work is
always an event, but the shock waves caused by the composer-lyricist's choice
of subject has helped make this one the hottest ticket of the New York theater
season. Promised a gallery of rogues in song, from John Wilkes Booth to Lee
Harvey Oswald, theatergoers have stood in line for hours for ticket
cancellations and returns.;    The production's two-month run for mostly
subscription audiences is scheduled to end on Feb. 16. Stories have circulated
about the critic for a major newspaper who turned blue in the outside line and
still didn't get a ticket. One Broadway producer of note complained that the
theater had turned down his request for tickets.;    Sondheim has shown
himself willing to upset audiences with the butchery of "Sweeney Todd," his
musical about a murderous barber. And he has tackled political theater in
"Pacific Overtures," a satire on Commodore Matthew Perry's opening of Japan to
Western trade. For "Assassins" he has been rejoined by John Weidman, who wrote
the book for "Pacific Overtures.";    Based on an idea by Charles Gilbert Jr.,
of Philadelphia's University of the Arts, "Assassins" brings together in a
hallucinatory afterlife nine people who made or planned attempts on the lives
of U.S. presidents.;    The musical makes the point that these nine are all
outsiders who have been denied their expected share of the American dream.
There is one chilling moment when Booth calmly explains to Lee Harvey Oswald
(Jace Alexander) that assassination is not just murder but a ticket to
immortality.;    Taken as a group, these people have the air of inmates of a
mental institution where the reigning delusion is not being a Napoleon but
rather a Charles Guiteau (Jonathan Hadary) shooting President Garfield, or a
Giuseppe Zangara (Eddie Korbich) missing Franklin D. Roosevelt and hitting
Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak. If they aren't all crazy, there is certainly an
appalling incoherence in the ultimate act they all commit -- an insane
disparity between motive and behavior.;    Terrence Mann's immigrant workman
Leon Czolgosz is an expressionless force of righteous anger, ignited by a love
for Emma Goldman and gunning down William McKinley. For comic relief, there
are Gerald Ford and the two addled women who bungled their mission. Charlie
Manson's acolyte, Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme (Annie Golden), is a caricature of
the flower child of the '60s, playing mentor to a moony, guitar-playing John
Hinckley (Greg Germann), who shoots again and again at a smiling portrait of
Ronald Reagan without even creasing it. The formidable Debra Monk gives a
memorably nutty performance as the suburbanite Sara Jane Moore.;    The most
frighteningly funny character of all is the little-known Samuel Byck, a loser
who, it seems, planned to kill Richard Nixon by crashing a plane into the
White House. Lee Wilkof gives this character's disordered mind a wild airing
as he talks to Leonard Bernstein on a tape recorder.;    A bit preachy;   
"Assassins" is not a perfect piece of work. There is some stupid show-business
nonsense about Booth killing because of bad reviews. (He is seen reading
Variety in a saloon.) There also is a tendency to hammer away at the theme of
social inequity, as if that explained everything. But on the whole, this is
provocative stuff, handled with imagination.  </TEXT>
