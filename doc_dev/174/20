<HEAD>High Wind Keeps Deaf and Blind Climbers From McKinley Summit</HEAD>

   An international team that includes two
blind climbers, a deaf climber and an amputee nearly made it to the
top of Mount McKinley, but 50 mph winds forced them to turn around,
officials said Thursday.
   The group got up to at least 18,000 feet, said Roger Robinson, a
U.S. Park Service ranger. At 20,320 feet, Mount McKinley is North
America's highest mountain.
   ``They've all descended. They're at 14,000 now. Indications are
they're not going back up,'' he said.
   ``They did very good considering that only about half the folks
that try McKinley make it to the top.''
   The ascent was attempted by 1,009 climbers last year; only 524
reached the summit.
   Adaptations were made for the disabled climbers.
   ``Apparently they've got ropes stretched out to the latrines when
they're at camps,'' said Bob Seiber, chief mountaineering ranger.
``They work extremely well together and develop their other senses,
I guess.''
   Patrick Reinhart, a member of the expedition and director of
Challenge Alaska, a group that helps develop recreational and sports
opportunities for disabled climbers, came up with the idea for the
ascent.
   Reinhart, who has an artificial foot, always wanted to climb
McKinley. So did Ross Watson, a Canadian member of the expedition
who lost his sight at age 12 in a pellet gun accident.
   Patrick Hurst, a 27-year-old Englishman who teaches outdoor
sports to physically disabled people, also is blind.
   Lkakpa Sonam, a Sherpa from Nepal, is deaf.
   In overall charge of the expedition is George Rooney, a member of
the American Alpine Club who's been up McKinley twice and tried
climbing Everest in a joint American-Polish expediton. He's also an
emergency medical technician and a specialist in mountain rescue.
