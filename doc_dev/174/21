<LEADPARA>  FRANKLIN-McKinley School District's new $7 million headquarters is far more
than offices. The renovated warehouse doubles as a community service center
for the largely low-income district, including a clinic for free medical care,
counseling services and even programs like Project Crackdown.;   But still, $7
million?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Even factoring out special costs, like structural changes to the building,
construction experts say the office space was expensive. Some teachers and
parents grumble about its comparative luxury while schools are in disrepair.; 
 And there's another problem. The district says it was told by the state that
it had to use revenue from property sales to build offices or the state would
claim the money. State officials say that's not true: Their rules encourage
districts to spend money on classrooms; offices are the last priority. And
while community services are great, the state Allocation Board would place
direct school needs first.;   The fact is Franklin-McKinley never sought to
spend this money on classrooms. The board wanted to build an education center
-- its name for the community facility -- and decided to sell excess property
to pay for it.;   Board president Lolita Foster says that when the project was
planned, starting in 1988, the district had programs in place to renovate
schools and build new ones, relying on state grants. The education center was
to round out the district's services.;   But state funding for classroom
renovations is inadequate, and the district has $21 million in unmet needs,
waiting in line for state funding.;   There are good arguments for the
community facility. Healthy, well-adjusted children learn better. But the
district was sloppy about clearing its plans with the state, and it appears to
have spent more than necessary for the space it gained. Some of that money
could have gone into the schools.;   Some controversial features in the new
building are common in the offices of private companies; the shower in the
superintendent's office, for instance. But the question isn't whether school
workers deserve those amenities. The question is how best to spend a
district's severely limited resources.;   Somebody at Franklin-McKinley should
have thought harder about that question.  </TEXT>
