GANESHA BLVD. RENAMED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted Monday to bestow the name "Fairplex Drive" on Ganesha 
Boulevard and parts of McKinley Avenue and E Street to give increased 
recognition to Fairplex, the site of the Los Angeles County Fair and other 
expositions. 
</P>
<P>
Fairplex Drive will become the designation for the full length of Ganesha, from 
Route 71 north to McKinley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Also redesignated as Fairplex Drive will be the portion of McKinley west of 
Ganesha Boulevard, and E Street from McKinley north to the city limits. The 
portions of McKinley and E Street that are being renamed are along the 
perimeter of the Fairplex property. 
</P>
<P>
The change will require the state to replace the Ganesha off-ramp signs on the 
San Bernardino Freeway. Robert DeLoach, city public works director, said the 
name change will take effect after the state Department of Transportation 
authorizes and makes the new freeway signs, which could take as long as nine 
months. He said the Los Angeles County Fair Assn. will pay the cost of the sign 
changes, estimated at $13,000 for the freeway and $3,000 for city streets.
