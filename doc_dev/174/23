<LEADPARA>  There won't be any layoffs in the Franklin-McKinley School District next year,
the district's board of trustees decided Tuesday in approving a 1991-'92
budget.;    But the district will have to cut $2.2 million from its $38
million general fund.;    Here is what the cuts, approved unanimously Tuesday,
will mean to the Franklin-McKinley community next year:  </LEADPARA>

FRANKLIN-MCKINLEY BOARD APPROVES OTHER CUTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     (check) Grants to encourage innovative teaching will be pared from $50,000
to $20,000.;    (check) The instrumental music program will be cut by a third,
going from three to two teachers.;    (check) There will be fewer classes that
mix students from different grade levels, because such classes require fewer
students and cost more than regular classes.;    (check) Schools will have to
pay the full cost of copying various printed matter, rather than having part
of this cost absorbed by the district's print shop.;    The budget approved
Tuesday is final, though adjustments could be made once the level of state
funding is determined.;    There was no public comment at Tuesday's meeting.; 
  "We hope the state doesn't put us through any more traumas," said board
Chairwoman Lolita Foster.;    Unlike employees in other school districts,
those at Franklin-McKinley will be spared layoffs. For the time being, they
can thank the fact that the district is growing.;    Next year, predictions
call for the student population to grow by 2.5 percent. The district hasn't
yet reached the point where the cost of educating the new students outstrips
extra state money they generate.  </TEXT>
