School District called to air a controversial choice proposal of its own.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Under the proposal, scheduled for a vote April 9, Franklin-McKinley would
add seventh and eighth grades to Stonegate School, an elementary school in one
of its quieter residential neighborhoods. Families who live in the district,
but have left its schools, would have first claim to admission.;    At last
Tuesday's meeting in a standing-room-only board room, several parents assailed
the plan as a form of economic discrimination and a vote of no confidence
against the district's two current middle schools -- J.W. Fair and
Sylvandale.;    "The decision to have a kindergarten through eighth grade at
Stonegate means the administration admits to rampant accusations that Fair . .
. does not have a nurturing environment, that they do not have a rigorous
academic curriculum, that they are not safe," said Cora Tomalinos, active in
the Parent-Teacher Association at Fair.;    Franklin-McKinley board members
offered little comment at the emotionally charged meeting.;    However,
Superintendent Dolores Ballesteros and other supporters defended the plan as a
means of luring back students who've been lost to other schools, by offering
them more choices within Franklin-McKinley. They called the nationwide trend
toward schools of choice a tide that can't be turned back.;    "Choice is
here, my dears, whether you like it or not," Ballesteros told the audience of
more than 50 parents, teachers and community members who turned out despite
the rain. "My personal opinion is that a majority of our students are always
going to go to our two middle schools. But it's pretty darn important that we
get those kids who've left our district back.";    Opponents of the Stonegate
proposal argued that they did not object to choice but thought the choice
should be available to all district parents.;    "I have nothing against a
seventh and eighth grade at Stonegate," said Ruth Smith, whose son attends
Stonegate. But she said she opposed a plan that favors students not in the
district's schools.;    "Just because I can afford private school for my child
should not be a determining factor as to what school my child goes to," she
said.;    But first granting admission to a seventh and eighth grades at
Stonegate to students already in district schools would not raise any new
money for Franklin-McKinley. And that was the whole idea behind the Stonegate
plan.;    District administrators came up with the plan earlier this year, in
an attempt to minimize looming budget cuts. Because Gov. Pete Wilson is
proposing suspending Proposition 98, the initiative that guarantees public
schools a minimum level of funding, Franklin-McKinley faces $2.5 million in
cuts next year, or 9 percent of what it currently spends.;    They claim that
about 125 middle school students eligible to attend Franklin-McKinley's
schools are now going elsewhere. If these students could be wooed back, the
district would get $350,000 in new state revenue. After paying teachers'
salaries and other costs, that would earn the district $85,000, staff members
estimate.;    However, Debbie Elliott, registrar at J.W. Fair, said the
district had yet to offer her proof that 125 middle school students have fled
the district. At a previous meeting, she claimed the number at Fair was closer
to 10.;    Other parents argued the district had no proof the Stonegate
proposal would entice back the parents the district hopes to reach.;   
"They're not here, they're not voicing their opinions," said Dina Arata,
president of the Kennedy School Parent-Teacher Association.;    According to
Ballesteros, the Stonegate proposal has generated interest among private
school families who heard about it by word of mouth. However, administrators
do not plan to initiate any contacts until the Stonegate proposal is approved,
she said.;    Under the Stonegate proposal, first choice would go to students
who live anywhere in the district but go to private schools or public schools
outside the district. Next in line would be those whose parents say they are
considering such a move.;    Third would come students with special needs,
such as those attending the Slingerland program at Stonegate for dyslexic
children. Ballesteros said the Stonegate proposal would be a godsend to
parents with sixth-graders in that program who fear their children will be
easily lost in the larger middle school atmosphere.;    "I have watched these
children just be decimated by the whole schooling experience," finally to meet
success in Stonegate's Slingerland program, Ballesteros said. Many of these
parents are "very concerned about leaving that success and having their
children 'mainstreamed,' " she said.;    Tina Nielson, a parent of a dyslexic
child who went from Stonegate's Slingerland to a district middle school,
agreed.;    Now all seventh- and eighth-graders in Franklin-McKinley go to the
district's two middle schools, J.W. Fair and Sylvandale.  </TEXT>
