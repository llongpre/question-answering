   Danaher Corp. said it agreed to sell its Mohawk Rubber Co. unit to McKinley Allsopp Inc. in a leveraged buy-out for about $70 million. 

   A McKinley unit will pay about $67 million in cash and $3 million of preferred stock for the Akron, Ohio-based tire maker, according to Danaher, a maker of automotive and transportation products. 

   McKinley, New York, an investment-banking firm, is a unit of Merchants Capital Corp., a Boston-based bank-holding concern. 

   McKinley will assume $5 million of Mohawk industrial-revenue bonds. 
Danaher will retain Mohawk's tubular-products division. 

   Completion of the transaction is expected within 30 days, Danaher said. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Danaher closed at $7.875 a share, up 50 cents.
