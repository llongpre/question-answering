   A record 916 people tackled Mount
McKinley during the mountaineering season, says the National Park
Service, which is thinking about putting another outhouse on North
America's tallest mountain.
   Sanitation on the 20,320-foot mountain has been a growing
concern, said Ranger Roger Robinson.
   According to Robinson, 562 of the 916 people who registered to
climb McKinley this spring and summer reported reaching the summit.
   Last year, 817 climbers tested themselves against the mountain.
Only about a third finished the climb.
   Two people died climbing McKinley this year, Robinson said.
   Don Henry, a 71-year-old Connecticut lawyer, this year became
the oldest person known to have made the top.
   Robinson attributed some of the increased mountaineering to
foreigners who decided attractive currency exchange rates made this
the year for the climb they had long wanted to make.
   Climbers began arriving in April and some waited until late
July, but most planned their trips for May and June.
   ``We're trying to get more people to come in July,'' Robinson
said. Rangers attempting to deal with the environmental effects of
increased activity want use of the mountain to be spread out.
   The Park Service asks climbers to use plastic bags for human
waste and put the bags in crevasses, but officials don't know how
many comply, Robinson said. There are two latrines on McKinley, one
two-thirds of the way up the peak. The Park Service hopes to
install an outhouse at 17,000 feet next year.
