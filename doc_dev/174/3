   Gerber Products Co. said William L. McKinley, its 63-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, was taking early retirement for "personal reasons." 

   Leo D. Goulet, 61, president and chief operating officer, will assume the chief executive's post immediately. 
However, the Fremont, Mich.-based company said that Mr. McKinley, who became chief executive less than two years ago, will stay on as chairman until July "to provide for an orderly transition." 

   Messrs. 
McKinley and Goulet both refused to discuss the change further. 
A company spokesman declined to elaborate on the reasons for the early retirement. 

   Mr. Goulet, in a prepared statement, said he didn't anticipate making any major changes in the company. 
He said that Mr. McKinley "leaves the company with a strong financial structure . . . 
Our competitive position also is excellent in all market areas, particularly Gerber baby foods." 

   But Wall Street analysts, who have been sharply critical of Mr. McKinley's performance during the past year, said they thought he was forced out under pressure from the directors, and perhaps the fear of a takeover bid. 
No bidder has emerged for the company. 

   "I think the board is being responsive to shareholders who were generally dissatisfied with the company's reluctance to maximize shareholder value," said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. 
"It's a well-known feeling on Wall Street that management wasn't trying to do that." 

   Specifically, analysts criticized Mr. McKinley's handling of the non-food businesses. 
"His non-food operations never performed up to snuff," said William Maguire of Merrill Lynch Research. 
He singled out the peformance of Gerber's truck, furniture, and apparel operations. 

   The company's net income for the fiscal year ended March 31 dropped 20% from the previous year for various reasons including stepped-up advertising. 

   "He was chairman over a pretty rough period of time," said Daniel F. Gerber, a board member and son of the company's founder. 

   Asked if the board asked Mr. McKinley to resign, Mr. Gerber said, "I wouldn't have any comment about that. 
Mr. McKinley resigned simply for personal reasons." 

   Mr. McKinley, who has worked with Gerber for 37 years, became chairman and chief executive in November 1985. 
Mr. Goulet, who has worked with Gerber for 32 years, became president and chief operating officer in February 1983.
