   A 71-year-old lawyer has become the
oldest climber on record to reach the summit of Mount McKinley, the
highest peak in North America, the National Park Service said.
   Don Henry of Middlebury, Conn., reached the top of the
20,320-foot peak Sunday in an unusually fast eight days from
Kahiltna Glacier, at McKinley's 7,000-foot level, rangers said
Friday. Records show the oldest climber prior to Henry was 68.
   Henry said he learned of the potential for a mountaineering
milestone when he checked in with rangers before the climb.
   ``So I said, `Thank you very much,''' Henry said.
   Henry climbed McKinley with a guide, Marty Schmidt, and another
mountaineer, Mark Landry, 24, who suffered altitude sickness and
didn't reach the summit until Monday. The three returned to
Kahiltna Glacier, and on Wednesday, they flew back to Anchorage.
   ``I found it extremely arduous above 14,000 feet,'' Henry said.
``It's heavy work.''
