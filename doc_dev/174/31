   Four years after record-breaking cold forced an
indoor inaugural, George Bush must cope with the vagaries of
Washington weather in planning for his presidential oath-taking.
   Bush's inaugural committee is making contingency plans, including
a swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, in the event of
weather disruptions.
   While meteorologists say it is too soon to make a prediction for
Friday, Inauguration Day, the 30-day weather forecast for Washington
in January called for a 55 percent chance of above normal
temperatures and dryer than normal conditions for the month.
   Does that mean Bush's inauguration won't be plagued by a driving
rain like that which nearly washed away Franklin D. Roosevelt's
second swearing-in, in 1937?
   Or a snowstorm such as nearly buried William Howard Taft in 1909?
   Or perhaps a raw, cloudy day like that in 1841 when William Henry
Harrison took office without hat or overcoat? Harrison caught a cold
that turned into pneumonia, killing him after but a month in office.
   President Reagan's 1985 inaugural ceremonies were moved inside
when 10-degree temperatures and winds of 17 mph put the wind chill
factor at 16 below zero.
   Such history notwithstanding, a study of climate shows the
Washington weather on Jan. 20 is often, but not always, mild.
   Weather historian Patrick Hughes details the effects of the
elements on inaugurations in the December issue of ``Weatherwise''
magazine. In his study he notes that average weather for the date is
44 degrees Fahrenheit, and normally only enough rain or snow falls
to wet the pavement.
   The date for the inauguration was changed in the 1930s, when it
was moved up from March 4. Jan. 20 was picked after a study of
weather records showed it to be usually mild, for that time of year.
   Roosevelt's wet and chilled ceremony in 1937 was the first to be
held in January, and criticism promptly followed.
   Sen. George W. Norris of Nebraska, who spearheaded the change,
warned critics to wait until March 4 to see what the weather would
be like then, before criticizing him for the change.
   ``It was, of course, a beautiful day _ sunny with a high
temperature of 67 degrees, unusually warm for that date,'' Hughes
observes.
   Perhaps the most practical approach to inaugural weather came
from Harry S. Truman. Upon receiving a formal invitation to his own
swearing-in ceremony, Truman wrote across it: ``Weather Permitting,
I hope to be present.'' It was a chilly 38 degrees and windy that
day, but the sun was out and Truman was there.
   Official weather records were not kept at the time, but
historians recorded it as a cool and clear day in New York City when
George Washington became the first president on April 30, 1789.
   Four years later the event was moved to Philadelphia and to March
4, as determined by Congress, and the weather was listed as
``pleasant'' for the start of Washington's second term. It was
``fair'' in the City of Brotherly Love when John Adams took office
in 1797.
   After that the ceremonies moved to the new capital city,
Washington, where it was ``mild and beautiful'' for Thomas Jefferson
in 1801 and ``fair'' for the start of his second term in 1895.
   James Madison's two terms both started in weather listed by
historians as ``probably fair.''
   Here is a rundown of subsequent presidents and the weather

Weather Stories:``
   _James Monroe, warm and sunny in 1817, snow and 28 degrees in
1821.
