<LEADPARA>  The board of the Franklin-McKinley School District reached a compromise last
week on a controversial proposal to add seventh and eighth grades to Stonegate
Elementary School as an alternative to the district's two middle schools.;   
Under the agreement, the district will add a seventh grade to Stonegate next
year. If the pilot program succeeds, an eighth grade will be added in
1992-'93, and two other elementary schools will also add the grade levels. To
help ensure equal access to all parents in the multilingual community, the
district will advertise the option in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and
Cambodian.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Criteria for choosing students to fill the two grades remain up in the air.
The board left that issue up staff members, with input from a board
representative. However, Superintendent Dolores Ballesteros promised that all
students will be given a fair chance.;    "This (compromise) nowhere near
resembles what was originally being planned" in February, board member
Francisco Dominguez said after the meeting.;    The original proposal included
adding seventh and eighth grades to only Stonegate Elementary School. And it
suggested giving admission priority to families who had removed their children
from district middle schools to enroll them elsewhere.;    The idea was
persuade these families to keep their children in Franklin-McKinley. But the
proposal generated passionate opposition from those who took it as an insult
to the district's two middle schools, J.W. Fair and Sylvandale. They said
those schools had suffered from a bad image for years, and that if there were
indeed problems with them, the district should fix them rather than offering
an alternative.;    The compromise passed, 4-1, last week after Dominguez and
Pearle Woodall, two board members who opposed the original plan, changed their
votes. Robin Rogers cast the lone no vote.;    Dominguez and Woodall said they
changed their position when a district survey taken in May showed 70 percent
of respondents supported the kindergarten through eighth grade concept.
"There's been a need expressed by parents," Woodall said.;    About 2,300
parents in the district of 10,000 students responded to the survey.;   
Dominguez added that the equal-access provision in the compromise also
influenced his decision.;    After the board agreed on the plan, it heard
about another choice in the offing. Starting this fall, parents who teach
their children at home may enroll them in Franklin-McKinley. For each
home-schooler, the district would receive about $2,800 in state attendance
money. It would in turn pay parents $1,000 per child for instructional
materials.;    Staff members decided to offer the option after learning that
home-schoolers living in Franklin-McKinley's area are enrolling in the
Cupertino Union School District to take advantage of a similar program. The
option benefits home-schooling parents by giving them a chance to network with
each other, Director of Curriculum Sandra Will told the board.;    Including
home-schoolers extends a district policy that already allows disabled
students, students whose families are on long vacations, and others with
special needs to be taught at home, Will said.;    In other business, board
members considered a proposed $2.2 million in cuts to the district's $38
million budget.;    Like school districts throughout California,
Franklin-McKinley is preparing for the cuts because of the state fiscal
crisis.;    The board's final vote on Franklin-McKinley's budget is scheduled
for June 25.  </TEXT>
