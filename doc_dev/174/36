<TEXT>     Perhaps it's a means of preserving a cultural institution that is bent on
its own destruction. Whatever the reason, if you are holiday shopping for
someone who loves the old shows and even the new, you can find some wonderful
recordings -- and at a mere fraction of the cost of seeing a current musical.;
  Seek and ye shall find gold. Here are reviews of some of the best recorded
musicals out right now.;   Note that all the shows discussed here, except the
recent musical "Assassins," deal with the theater itself. They are shows about
show business, something Broadway does exceedingly well. "A Chorus Line," not
reviewed, is a major example.;   "Assassins" turned the lives of accused,
attempted, and convicted assassins into a musical -- and was a controversial
failure this year off-Broadway.;   'Show Boat';   Conductor/arranger John
McGlinn and England's EMI Records have created a whole new musical theater
industry: the concert recordings of major musicals from a historical
perspective.;   "Show Boat" was the beginning in 1988. McGlinn assembled an
impressive cast and produced the full score of this 1927 Jerome Kern/Oscar
Hammerstein II musical, based on the novel by Edna Ferber.;   Full score means
this album contains not only the Broadway score from the show's 1927 run, but
songs, underscoring and other music that were deleted during the show's tryout
period on the road.;   McGlinn even found and recorded material written during
the planning stages of the show, most of which was discarded before rehearsals
began. In addition, the album includes songs written for the 1928 London
production and the 1946 revival, plus three songs written expressly for a
Universal film adaptation in 1936.;   Songs that were drastically cut are
recorded in both the cut and lengthier versions. And in order to display
Kern's lovely underscoring (music played during dialogue) for the show, much
dialogue is also recorded on this extensive album.;   Up until 1982, the
manuscript of the full score, in the hands of orchestrator Robert Russell
Bennett, had been presumed lost. But it was found in a Warner Bros. music
storage warehouse in Secaucus, N.J.;   Listening to this great American
musical -- with original dialogue restored -- is a remarkably authentic
experience. Using Russell's original orchestrations, the London Sinfonietta,
conduced by McGlinn, produces a rich sound yet with the inflections of musical
theater, not symphony.;   Teresa Stratas as Julie offers lovely, full-bodied
renditions of such great songs as "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" and "Bill." As
Magnolia, soprano Frederica Von Stade makes a delightful contrast in the
beautiful ballad "Make Believe.";   But it is the scoring of some of the new
material as arranged here, "Mis'ry's Comin' 'Round" first sung by Karla Burns
as Queenie, and "It's Getting Hotter in the North," a dropped song sung by Von
Stade as Kim, a character all but written out of the Broadway show, that make
this recording especially exciting.;   Bruce Hubbard, as Joe, handles "Ol' Man
River" well but not notably so.;   Kern may well have been the most gifted
composer the Broadway stage ever heard. His music is voluptuous, hugely
melodic yet sprightly when it needs to be. George Gershwin may have done him
one better in "Porgy and Bess," but you'll start an interesting debate on
that.;   Hammerstein's lyrics are becoming more dated every year, yet his
simple, heartfelt empathy with his characters still shines. His wit in "Life
Upon the Wicked Stage" is charming, and his powerful lyrics for "Ol' Man
River" are still moving, 64 years later.;   The cassette-tape recording, under
the EMI Digital label and including a 134-page book of dialogue, libretto,
history and photos, sells for $17.95 and that's a huge bargain. The CD is
priced at $44.99.;   'Kiss Me, Kate';   Cole Porter wrote a terrific song
called "It Was Great Fun the First Time" for "Kiss Me, Kate" in 1948. Then,
during rehearsals, the song was replaced by "Wunderbar," and it pretty much
disappeared.;   McGlinn does not let anything from a Broadway show disappear,
and it is part of this recording of the great Porter show, based on
Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew.";   Porter almost disappeared himself
in the eight years prior to "Kiss Me, Kate." Porter was a man of the '30s,
reflecting the posture of the sophisticated rich looking askance at the
depressing times. Porter wrote "Panama Hattie" in 1940, then flubbed with
"Seven Lively Arts" in 1944 and "Around the World" in 1946. He seemed
finished.;   But librettists Sam and Bella Spewack thought a witty adaptation
of Shakespeare's "Shrew" would be right up his alley. And they brought Porter
back late in his career to write what was probably his best Broadway show.;  
McGlinn's conducting and direction are again superb, though I quarrel with the
casting of Josephine Barstow as Lilli Vanessi (Katharine in "Shrew"). Her
singing is far too operatic to suit this score and its witty lyrics. Kim
Criswell as Lois Lane (Bianca) is also somewhat stuffy.;   The show, which was
an immediate Broadway hit, winning five Tony Awards, includes such memorable
songs as "Another Op'nin', Another Show," "So in Love," "Wunderbar," and
"Always True to You (Darlin') in My Fashion.";   Then there are the songs
dropped in rehearsal, which on this album include "It Was Great Fun the First
Time" (too bitter, the producers thought) and "A Woman's Career" (which would
make feminists riot if sung today), and "What Does Your Servant Dream About?"
Both the song and the character who sings it were dropped.;   The album,
produced by EMI Digital on two cassettes and selling for about $17.95,
includes an 86-page booklet of libretto, history and an interview with
Patricia Morison, who starred in the Broadway original with Alfred Drake. The
CD costs $31.99. It's less ambitious than "Show Boat" but still a treat.;  
McGlinn has two other full-score recordings on the market now. There's "Annie
Get Your Gun," the Irving Berlin hit, which was released a couple of months
ago, also on EMI, and Cole Porter's "Anything Goes," which is even newer.;  
'The Will Rogers Follies';   This is the hit musical that opened last spring
and is still on Broadway, with a score composed by Cy Coleman (music) and
Betty Comden and Adolph Green (lyrics). Peter Stone wrote the book.;   Though
you don't get all the feathered costumes and pulchritude of the Broadway stage
show on the Columbia Records release, you do get a fine appreciation of the
show's music.;   This show clearly isn't a classic. There are few really high
points. "Willamania" gets played a lot, and it is a tuneful, upbeat melody,
but like most of the music in the show, it's lyrically flat.;   Keith
Carradine's vocals display the Will Rogers charm that has kept this show
going. His "Never Met a Man I Didn't Like," in an easy-going folk-songish
baritone, seems more tolerable on record than it did on stage. "Give a Man
Enough Rope" is another pleasant song sung by Carradine.;   But Dee Hoty as
Betty Blake is just about lost on the record and, of course, you only hear the
beautiful girls, who have little to sing anyway.;   In contrast to Broadway's
rich history, this is a mediocre little show, but thanks to
director/choreographer Tommy Tune (whose dances can't be put on record) and
the total lack of competition, it's one of today's Broadway winners. The
cassette tape is priced at $9.95, the CD at $14.99.;   'Follies';   Stephen
Sondheim's infinitely more enthralling "Follies" is available now in the
concert version given at New York City's Avery Fisher Hall in 1985.;   The
recording, produced by Thomas Z. Shepard for RCA/Ariola International,
showcases an exhilarating musical as sung by a marvelous cast. As Sondheim
continues to grow in stature, "Follies" may go down as his most accessible
show, even though it, like most of the Sondheim repertoire, originally had
trouble finding an audience in New York. The show played a little more than a
year.;   This concert version features the great Barbara Cook bringing down
the house with "Losing My Mind," Elaine Stritch's delightfully sardonic
"Broadway Baby," Lee Remick's bitter "Could I Leave You?" and Carol Burnett's
triumphant "I'm Still Here." All of these numbers were followed (as you can
hear) by cheers of approval. Mandy Patinkin and George Hearn are outstanding
in their numbers as well.;   This album also includes a libretto booklet that
will help you appreciate the sophisticated brilliance of Sondheim's lyrics.
The choral work and underscoring, as performed by the New York Philharmonic
led by Paul Gemignani, makes this a special experience. Oh, to have been in
Fisher Hall when this was recorded. The cassette is $17.95, the CD $31.99.;  
'Assassins';   Sondheim doesn't handle commonplace themes. This show, with an
original book by John Weidman, brings together a handful of American
presidential assassins and would-be assassins in a sort of cheering section
for their version of the American dream.;   It's a novel approach to a
musical, and some of Sondheim's lyrics are as fascinating as ever. But this is
a dour show. Its intellectual pretensions are unredeemed by any charm. The
whole affair fails from sheer blackness.;   Nevertheless, the cast is in fine
voice, making for a first-class album. Among the assassins -- accused,
convicted or would-be -- are Jace Alexander as Lee Harvey Oswald, Victor
Garber as John Wilkes Booth, Debra Monk as Sara Jane Moore, Greg Germann as
John Hinckley, Annie Golden as Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme (who tried to kill
President Ford) and Terrence Mann as Leon Czolgosz (who assassinated President
McKinley). There are others.;   Michael Starobin orchestrated the show and
served as musical supervisor. The 33 musicians who make up the orchestra give
the score a body it lacked in the Playwrights Horizon production in New York,
where the band numbered three.;   RCA Victor recorded the show after its brief
run earlier this year. If you buy the CD ($13.99), you can get a 36-page
booklet by mail which includes libretto and color photos. Or you can get the
Theater Communications Group paperback for $9.95. The cassette sells for
$9.95.;   Other shows;   Other new shows available these days include the
London recording of the John Kander and Fred Ebb show "70 Girls 70" and a new
"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," the Andrew Lloyd Webber show
starring Jason Donovan, on Polydor/Really Useful Records. ShowMusic Magazine,
which we profiled earlier, provides a continuing update for musical-theater
record buffs. (box)  </TEXT>
