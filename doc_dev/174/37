   A Japanese climber became the first
person to die on Mount McKinley this year after he was stranded
without a tent for two days at the 19,000-foot level, authorities
said.
   Rescuers believe they were within 200 feet of Hairoaki Ito when
he died Sunday.
   Ito and a companion had become separated from five other
climbers in their party, most of whom had reached the summit
Saturday, said Bob Seibert, chief mountaineering ranger for the
National Park Service.
   The cause of death was not immediately known, but Seibert said
the 38-year-old Ito was suffering from exposure and altitude
sickness.
   ``To be exposed to Denali weather at that elevation is just
asking for it,'' said Renny Jackson, a ranger who had descended
Saturday after spending 24 days on the mountain. Denali is the
native Alaskan name for McKinley.
   Ito died as his fellow climber was trying to reach him with an
air-dropped oxygen bottle and as a climbing party that included
physicians was scrambling up the mountain.
   Ito, from Hyogo, Japan, was the first to die on the mountain
since three British climbers were killed last fall. More than 40
people have died on Mount McKinley, the continent's tallest peak at
20,320 feet.
