   A three-member Austrian party have
reported reaching the summit of Mount McKinley, according to the
pilot who flew them to North America's highest mountain two weeks
ago.
   A Japanese party was reported ``high on the mountain,'' and a
lone climber from Anchorage hopes to reach the top via the
treacherous Cassin Ridge route, the National Park Service said.
   Pilot Doug Geeting said Monday he established radio contact with
the Austrian party Sunday and was told all three members had reached
the summit of the 20,320-foot mountain.
   Geeting said the Austrians didn't say which day they reached the
top. Monday, they were at a base camp at 7,200 feet, awaiting a
flight out, but harsh weather restricted aviation.
   Up to this year, mountaineers had accomplished winter ascents of
McKinley nine times, with most traveling in parties. In 1988, Vern
Tejas, a professional climbing guide from Anchorage, became the
first person to climb McKinley alone in the winter and survive the
trip.
   The Austrian party of professional guides led by Helmut
Steinmassl, 29, began its expedition Feb. 14, a day before the
Japanese party of three began its ascent. Geeting and the Park
Service said the exact location of the Japanese climbers was not
known. The group was led by Nobura Yamada, 39.
   ``All we've heard about the Japanese is that they're hunkered
down,'' Park Service Ranger Bob Seibert said. ``I'm sure they can't
move in those winds.''
   The Austrians had relatively favorable weather for their climb,
Seibert said, but conditions changed drastically by Monday as fierce
gusts swept over wide regions of Alaska, including the McKinley area.
   The solo climber, 33-year-old Dave Staley, began his climb Sunday
and planned to follow the Cassin Ridge route, Park Service spokesman
John Quinley said. Such an ascent has been accomplished only once by
a team and never by an individual climber, he said.
   The Cassin Ridge is ``a lot steeper than the West Buttress
(route) ... and it has a lot fewer sheltered camping sites,''
Quinley said.
