   Gerber Products Co. said William L. McKinley resigned from its board. 
The company previously announced that Mr. McKinley stepped down as chief executive officer in May, and as chairman earlier this week. 

   Gerber has said Mr. McKinley, 63 years old, severed his ties with the company for "personal reasons." 

   The baby-food maker also said it expects to appoint a new chief executive officer within two months. 
Gerber appointed Leo D. Goulet to that post in May, but he died of a heart attack earlier this month. 

   Robert D. Carlson, president of Crowley, Milner &amp; Co., a Detroit-based department store chain, will fill out the final year of Mr. McKinley's term. 

   Gerber also announced that George A. Purvis, 54, was given the newly created title of corporate vice president-research and development. 
He was previously a vice president in the same department. 
J. Ronald Lovasz, 54, was promoted to the newly created position of vice president-quality control, research division. 
He previously was director of corporate quality control.
