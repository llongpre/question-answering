   Presto-Tek Corp. said transactions were completed that changed control of 33.4% of its stock and extended the payment schedule on some debt. 

   The Los Angeles-based maker of beverage and ice vending machines said the transactions included the sale by Sam B. Norris Jr., the company's founder and president, of 413,500, or 16.7%, of its common shares outstanding, to McKinley Allsopp Inc., a New York-based investment banking concern. 
The price was $400,000. 

   In a separate transaction, Mr. Norris sold a like amount of stock -- the balance of his 33.4% holding -- to the company for a $350,000, three-year 8.5% note and the forgiveness of $76,887 he owed Presto-Tek. 

   Presto-Tek plans to sell about 400,000 of its shares through a private placement by McKinley Allsopp to a group of investors that will include McKinley Allsopp. 

   Separately, Revere Fund Inc., a shareholder and creditor, agreed to revise terms for the repayment of a $2 million note, delaying a major portion of the 1988 principal payment to later years. 

   Presto-Tek reported a loss of $279,000 for the nine months ended July 31 on $3.6 million in sales.
