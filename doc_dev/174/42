<LEADPARA>  Scrambling for dollars to minimize hefty budget cuts, San Jose's
Franklin-McKinley School District is considering adding seventh and eighth
grades to an elementary school in one of its better neighborhoods -- and
giving first dibs to students who have abandoned its schools.;    While some
parents enthusiastically support the proposal, which could bring the district
$85,000, others argue it would create a system in which economics would
dictate which public school a child goes to.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We're a public school and we ought to serve the needs of all our
students," said Debbie Elliott, a registrar at J.W. Fair Middle School who
opposes the plan.;    Under the proposal, Franklin-McKinley would add seventh
and eighth grades to Stonegate School, an elementary school in a quiet
residential neighborhood near the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds. First
priority for admission would go to students who live anywhere in the district
but go to private schools or public schools outside the district. Next in line
would be youths whose parents say they are considering such an exodus.;    Now
seventh- and eighth-graders go to the district's two middle schools, including
J.W. Fair, in one of San Jose's roughest neighborhoods.;   
Franklin-McKinley's board is scheduled to discuss the idea at a public meeting
tonight. No date has been set for a vote. But Superintendent Dolores
Ballesteros said the district must move quickly to have the new grades up and
running at Stonegate by fall.;    Ballesteros said the district already has a
stack of applications from parents who want to send their children to a new
seventh and eighth grade at Stonegate. Some favor Stonegate because it is
close to their homes. Others say the school would provide the nurturing,
academically rigorous environment they seek for their children.;    At last
week's school board meeting, only trustee Lolita Foster solidly endorsed the
proposal, arguing that the district must do something to meet the needs of
students who are leaving. But the four other board members expressed
reservations.;    "Fair right now is at a minimum enrollment," said trustee
Ronald Masuda. "They are trying desperately to raise that. This might lower
their enrollment to below minimum.";    District administrators, who floated
the idea, said about 125 middle school students who are eligible to attend its
schools are going elsewhere. Attracting these students back could bring in
$350,000 in state revenue. After paying teachers' salaries and other costs,
that would earn the district $85,000 at a time when Franklin-McKinley faces
$2.5 million in budget cuts next year, or 9 percent of what it currently
spends.;    "The idea came out of talks to minimize cuts," Ballesteros said.
She added that it would use three classrooms at Stonegate that are vacant.
Stonegate's enrollment is about 750.;    But some parents with children at
Fair take it as an insult to their school and to the other district middle
school, Sylvandale.;    "It's a slap on both our junior high schools," said
Darlene Gearso, whose daughter attends eighth grade at Fair. "It's saying the
teachers (there) are not doing a good job.";    Unlike Stonegate's feeder
area, which consists largely of stable homeowners, Fair also takes in schools
such as Santee, where 60 percent of the students leave in a year.;    "It (the
Santee neighborhood) is where most new immigrants come because there's cheap
housing," said Herm Shaver, a recreation superintendent with San Jose's
Project Crackdown, a program to reduce drug dealing in neighborhoods.;    The
Santee neighborhood's incidence of drug arrests ranks among the top six in the
city, Shaver said.;    It is concerns such as these that have some parents
worried about sending their children to seventh grade at Fair and eager to
enroll them at Stonegate instead.;    "Stonegate is a safe school, a safe
area," said David Dees, a manager at Sun Microsystems who has a son at Fair.
"It's a lot safer than Fair.";     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Franklin-McKinley
school board will meet tonight in the board room at the district office at 420
Tully Road in San Jose. The Stonegate proposal is scheduled to be discussed at
8:30 p.m.  </TEXT>
