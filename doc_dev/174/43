My son, who is in the first grade, goes to McKinley Elementary School, located 
in the mid-city area of Santa Monica. There is an extraordinary and wonderful 
diversity at this school. 
</P>
<P>
This year's kindergarten class, for example, has 62 students, 38 of whom speak 
a language other than English at home. Fifteen of the children speak Spanish, 
and among the remaining 23 kids, 12 other languages are spoken. All together, 
there are kids from 45 nationalities in a school of 450 students, an ethnic 
flowering that does justice to the concept of Greater Los Angeles as a "world 
city." 
</P>
<P>
There is also a wide diversity in economic levels at McKinley. Though some 
families are homeowners or live in condos, most McKinley families tend to be at 
the lower end of Santa Monica's income scale. A number of the kids are homeless 
(about 3% of the school-age population this year, but as high as 10% last 
year). As many as 15% of the kids do not live in Santa Monica. Their families 
work in the city, and school board policy allows the children to attend Santa 
Monica schools. This policy is particularly relevant in the McKinley area, 
where there has been an explosion of commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
When I drop my son off in the morning, I love to walk through the schoolyard. 
There is a magnificent vibrancy, a special richness to how kids from such a 
variety of families interact and enjoy each other. 
</P>
<P>
The school has a number of teachers, several just launching their careers, who 
also seem to relish the challenges inherent in the situation. This year, my son 
is in a bilingual class that he loves, although in some ways "bilingual" is a 
euphemism. Ultimately, perhaps, McKinley is no different from other schools in 
that the kids are taught to read and write in English, do math and learn much 
of the standard state curriculum. The diversity is in the numbers and in the 
daily life of the school beyond what is formally taught. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this richness of opportunities, McKinley, like nearly all our public 
schools, confronts a range of serious problems. Per-pupil spending in 
California has declined dramatically, from $4,200 to less than $3,200, in this 
post-Proposition 13 era. That means more students per class, less equipment, 
less money for teacher salaries and and less money to upgrade facilities. Fund 
raising by McKinley parents averages about $25 to $50 per pupil, compared to a 
couple of the schools north of us, where wealthier parents have been able to 
raise as much as $1,250 per pupil. 
</P>
<P>
McKinley also has to contend with problems stemming from commercial 
development: more traffic, smog, noise and different land uses. Yet the Santa 
Monica City Council, which has been at the forefront in arranging developer 
agreements responsible for such community needs as additional low-income 
housing or on-site environmental innovations, has never included support for 
public schools, despite the fact that they are directly affected by these 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most disturbing is the contrast between the school population and the 
neighborhood population. Though Santa Monica has the undeserved reputation of 
being primarily a wealthy enclave (both the income levels and ethnic makeup of 
the entire city tend to reflect Los Angeles County averages), there are to be 
sure middle- and upper-class residents, including McKinley's neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of these residents do not have children, an increasing number do. 
Many of these children are being sent not to the McKinleys but to private 
schools. Though these schools pay lip service to "diversity" by offering a 
handful of scholarships, tuition cost alone (about $6,000) ensures a class and 
racial exclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
This two-tier public-private school division is at the heart of the dilemma for 
schools like McKinley. Private schools are a private solution, and their growth 
mirrors the erosion of citizen involvement throughout society. We have learned 
of the importance of taking responsibility from such issues as environmental 
degradation. So too, the schools have to become our public responsibility, from 
our individual choices to our actions at the community and statewide level. And 
as I walk through this schoolyard, listening to the excitement of the children, 
I wish their vibrancy could extend to our communities and to the larger 
society, where public engagement remains so elusive.
