   Four Japanese mountain climbers
attempting a winter ascent of Mount McKinley's dangerous West
Buttress haven't been seen in nearly two weeks.
   Four other climbers have died on North America's highest
mountain during winter.
   At high elevations in winter, McKinley often has white-out
conditions with wind that can exceed 200 mph. The mountain is in
Denali National Park, the native American name for the mountain.
   The climbers and their equipment, including a 35-day supply of
food, were flown to a camp on the southeast fork of the Kahiltna
Glacier on Feb. 11, said Park Service mountaineering ranger Bob
Seibert. Since then, the weather on the 20,320-foot mountain
generally has been bad.
   Cliff Hudson, a bush pilot who flew the group onto the mountain,
said he was scheduled to check on them last week. But he said he
could not because visibility on the mountain has been close to zero.
   Hudson and Seibert said the group was last seen Feb. 22 at about
the 11,000-foot level by a plane flying overhead. There were no
apparent problems.
   Hudson said he would try to fly over the mountain as soon as
weather permitted. ``They have priority,'' he said.
   When the group left Talkeetna, outside the park, they gave March
15 as the ``last due out'' date, Seibert said. That is the day a
search would begin if they don't return.
   Hiroshi Oda, 37 of Osaka, is leading the 1990 Japan Winter
McKinley Expedition. With him are Takeyoshi Takatsuka, 47, of
Toyama; Osamu Tagaya, 34, of Akita; and Junji Saito, 25, also of
Osaka.
   All four are experienced mountaineers, Seibert said.
   Oda has successfully climbed Mount Everest and McKinley's West
Buttress during summer, and Takatsuka has scaled Everest and K2,
the two highest peaks in the world, Seibert said.
   If successful, they would be the first Japanese to successfully
scale the West Buttress in winter.
   Last March, three Japanese climbers were lost in a storm on
their way up the mountain during a storm that featured 200-plus mph
wind. A fourth member of that group returned to camp alone before
his fellow climbers were lost.
   In 1984, solo adventurer Naomi Uemura died on his way down the
mountain after planting his flag at the top. It is believed he also
died in a winter storm, Seibert said.
