   The pistol Teddy Roosevelt carried in his
charge up San Juan Hill has been stolen, officials said Saturday.
   The .45-caliber Colt revolver was discovered missing from
Sagamore Hill, the Long Island home of the nation's 26th president,
which is run as a museum by the National Park Service.
   Chief Ranger Ray Bloomer, who is blind, noticed Saturday that
the exhibit case that contained the gun was loose, and summoned a
sighted Park Service investigator. Nothing else was missing from
the case, which also contained Roosevelt's Rough Riders uniform,
hat and gloves.
   It appeared someone forced open a door to the case Thursday or
Friday, Bloomer said. Fifty to 100 visitors pass through on an
average day.
   The pistol, now valued at $500,000, was given to Roosevelt after
it was recovered from the battleship Maine, whose sinking in Havana
Harbor in 1898 led to the United States' declaration of war against
Spain.
   The gun's blued barrel is inscribed with the words, ``July 1,
1898, San Juan, carried and used by Col. Theodore Roosevelt,'' and
``From the sunken battleship MAINE.''
   Roosevelt killed at least one enemy soldier with the gun during
the charge up San Juan Hill that gave the U.S. Army control of the
hills overlooking Havana and Roosevelt his reputation as a national
hero, Bloomer said. The only other weapon he carried during the
charge was his sword.
   The inscription should make it difficult to sell at its
estimated value of $500,000, said Park Service spokeswoman Edie
Shean-Hammond.
   Roosevelt became president after William McKinley was
assassinated in 1901 and served until 1909.
