   Vernon Tejas awoke uneasily in the
darkness of his snow cave, high on Mount McKinley. It was his 20th
day climbing the continent's highest peak, and he was the only
living soul for miles.
   But now someone, or something, seemed to be in the cave with him.
   ``It could have been just the wind,'' the 35-year-old Alaskan
recalled. ``But I was pretty convinced right then and there that
Naomi was in there with me.''
   On Feb. 12, 1984, Naomi Uemura became the first mountaineer to
scale Mount McKinley alone in winter. He vanished in a storm on the
way down, and some veteran climbers believe the Japanese explorer's
spirit still roams the mountain.
   Tejas called out ``Good morning!'' in Japanese. The roaring wind
outside gave the only reply, and Tejas settled back, convinced the
spirit was benign.
   The wind eased the next day, March 7, and Tejas climbed to the
summit, where he planted a Japanese flag to honor the man who
blazed the way for him. Then he did something Uemura failed to do.
He came back.
   Mount McKinley, elevation 20,320 feet, is considered North
America's ultimate mountaineering challenge. The vertical reach
from base camp on the Kahiltna Glacier to the summit is 13,200 feet
_ about 2,000 feet greater than the climb up Mount Everest.
   Each May and June, hundreds of climbers flock to McKinley.
Unbearable arctic weather forces more than half to turn back short
of the summit.
   In winter, the unbearable turns unbelievable. Temperatures can
dip to minus 58 degrees, and storms rake the mountain with
hurricane-force winds.
   Only four teams have made it to the top in winter since the
first expedition in 1967; two of them lost climbers. Uemura was one
of two climbers to die in a recent flurry of solo winter attempts.
   In all, McKinley's slopes are littered with the memories of more
than 50 dead climbers.
   Tejas knows all the grim mileposts _ crevassed areas named for
climbers they swallowed, a slope dubbed the Autobahn for the many
Germans who have fallen there _ and he uses them as warning signs.
   ``I want to challenge myself to live as fully and completely as
possible,'' he said. ``A lot of people will say, `You're doing
something that jeopardizes your ability to live.' But by living on
the edge, I can define life a lot easier. It doesn't make you love
it any less. It makes you love it more.''
   Tejas returned as something of a local hero. As he sat recently
in a sunlit Anchorage cafe, strangers kept interrupting to
congratulate him.
   They stopped partly because of his accomplishment, partly
because Tejas is hard to miss. His head, at its lower elevations,
is forested by a bushy black beard; the summit is bare, shaved
daily except for a neatly braided rattail.
   Tejas (pronounced TAY-hoss) stands 5-foot-8 and has a
personality that lives up to his hairstyle. A veteran of 13
successful McKinley climbs, most of them as a guide for Genet
Expeditions, he bounces boisterous yodels off the bergschrund and
readily pulls a fiddle from his pack to scratch out folk tunes.
   He came to Alaska in 1973, a flatlander from Houston. Within
three days, he stood slack-jawed in Denali National Park, watching
as clouds unveiled McKinley's towering north face. Tejas fell in
love.
   He worked construction jobs and lived in a tent to save money
``to get into climbing big time.'' He first climbed McKinley in
1978; the next year he was invited back to guide.
   In 1986, he led the first successful winter climb of Canada's
Mount Logan, North America's second-tallest peak. Two months later,
back on McKinley, he took part in a daring rescue, climbing over
the summit ridge and rappelling 600 feet to reach two altitude-sick
Korean climbers.
   National Park Service rangers discourage solo climbs of McKinley
and tried to dissuade another climber who started up the same day
as Tejas. That climber, with no previous arctic experience, was
flown out with frostbitten toes after five days.
   Tejas was not warned.
   ``I think Vern is a very special case,'' said Ralph Moore, a
mountaineering ranger who lauds Tejas as a cautious climber and a
meticulous planner. ``With Vern, it was a very calculated risk. He
knew what he was getting into.''
   Tejas proudly notes he can still count to 20 on his fingers and
toes, each digit intact and unfrozen. To prevent slips into
crevasses on his solo climb, he strapped a 16-foot extension ladder
to his body _ ``my aluminum albatross,'' he calls it.
   Tejas was flown to McKinley on Feb. 16 by glacier pilot Lowell
Thomas Jr. He carried 170 pounds of gear and enough food for 16
days. But as he packed a toboggan, he decided he had too much. He
left behind his tent and 20 pounds of food.
