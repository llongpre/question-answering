<LEADPARA>  As of last week, 99 parents had applied to enroll their students in the
seventh grade to be opened at Franklin-McKinley School District's Stonegate
School this fall.;    And the district will be able to admit them all, except
for the three late applicants, who will be added to the waiting list.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We can hold anywhere from 85 to 95 students," said Assistant
Superintendent Jim Abbott.;    The application period for the new program was
from June 19 to 26.;    The largest number of students guaranteed seats -- 30
-- came from Stonegate itself. Windmill Springs students added another 18 to
the pool. Kids from Hillsdale, Franklin and Seven Trees schools contributed
10, 9, and 8 respectively to the tally.;    The remaining seven schools
accounted for six or fewer applicants each. The lowest participation -- one
applicant each -- came from Los Arboles, McKinley and Santee schools.;   
"Stonegate had the most applicants, but it wasn't lopsided as people thought
it would be," said Superintendent Dolores Ballesteros.;    Now seventh- and
eighth-graders are assigned to one of the district's two middle schools, J.W.
Fair and Sylvandale, depending on their attendance area. The seventh grade at
Stonegate will offer them a choice. If the pilot program succeeds, an eighth
grade will be added the following year.;    Approved by Franklin-McKinley's
school board in June, the Stonegate idea was defended by supporters as a way
of retaining students who need a more sheltered environment than the middle
schools can provide. But it was also slammed by opponents as catering only to
Stonegate parents -- at the expense of the district's poorer neighborhoods.;  
 To help assure equal access to parents in the multilingual community, staff
members sent applications out in four languages -- English, Spanish,
Vietnamese and Cambodian. But most forms came back in English, Abbott said.;  
 McKinley Principal Rod Cryer said he was not surprised that interest in a
seventh grade at Stonegate was so low in his school, which has one of the
district's highest concentrations of families who speak little English or who
are on welfare.;    "A lot of our parents didn't go past the fourth grade if
they went to school at all," Cryer said. Having a seventh-grade option "might
not be a meaningful option to them," he said.;    Though the district will bus
students to the new seventh grade, Cryer said transportation is still an
issue.;    "Parents want to feel they can get to a child in an emergency. And
in our school, many have no personal transportation," Cryer said. "They are
not necessarily literate. They may have difficulty using transit systems.";   
McKinley is the northernmost school from Stonegate, which is in the district's
center.;    Plans call for a seventh and eighth grade to be added at two
elementary schools in the north and south of the district in upcoming years.; 
  A Stonegate father whose daughter has been accepted in the new program said
he was excited.;    "I would like her to stay in Stonegate because it's a
quiet neighborhood nearby my house," Quang To said.;    And a mother whose son
will come from the Windmill Springs area said she believes her son will get a
good academic foundation at Stonegate.;    "I'm happy they're going to bus
them over," Gloria Avila added. "It puts a little less pressure on us."  </TEXT>
