   A woman whose guided party
was pushing for Mount McKinley's summit has become the first
fatality of the 1988 climbing season on North America's tallest
peak, the National Park Service said.
   The agency said it learned early Wednesday that Lynn Salerno,
31, of Anchorage, had died of apparent hypothermia and exposure at
the mountain's 19,500-foot level. Rangers did not know the
circumstances or time of death.
   Salerno was in a party led by Vern Tejas, 35, an Alaskan whose
solo winter ascent of 20,320-foot McKinley this year made
mountaineering history.
   The party is believed to have begun its climb on or about May 1.
