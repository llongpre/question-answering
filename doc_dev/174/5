   Add one more issue to the list of conundrums
Congress will have to unravel when it returns from its summer
recess next month: whether the tallest mountain in North America
should be renamed.
   It's a perennial duel between an Ohio congressman protecting the
honor of William McKinley, the 25th U.S. president after whom the
peak is named, and an Alaska senator defending his state's right to
name its own land features.
   The motives of Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, are easy to discern.
   ``His long-range goal is to see if the mountain can be renamed
with Alaskans' wishes,'' says Connie Godwin, his spokeswoman.
   It takes only a quick look at the background of Rep. Ralph
Regula, R-Ohio, to explain why he cares about the name of the
20,320-foot mountain in central Alaska, a continent away from the
people he represents.
   ``McKinley is from my district,'' Regula says.
   McKinley, assassinated in 1901, was not only from Regula's
district, but once held Regula's seat in Congress and is buried in
the district. Regula is even a graduate of the William McKinley
School of Law.
   McKinley _ the mountain _ is in Denali National Park, which was
renamed in 1980 from McKinley National Park. Denali is an Indian
word for ``The Great One,'' and many Alaskans would like to see the
mountain bear the same name.
   ``It's owned by 230 million Americans,'' Regula said last week.
``Alaska gets millions of dollars in taxes, and taxpayers from the
entire country have a right to decide what happens there.''
   A provision forbidding the government to rename the mountain was
buried in the fine print of the annual Interior Department spending
bill that the House passed July 12. When the Senate approved its
version of the legislation two weeks later, the Mt. McKinley
language was removed.
   It's a legislative dance that has been going on for years, and
Regula has always prevailed.
   ``Ted goes along with a one-year prohibition, but not with
statutorily naming it Mt. McKinley,'' says Regula.
   Like most geographic features, Mt. McKinley was not given its
name by law. Rather, its name is officially recognized by the Board
of Geographic Names, a division of the Interior Department.
   It was named Mt. McKinley in 1896, when McKinley was Ohio
governor and the Republican presidential candidate against Democrat
William Jennings Bryan.
   In 1975, the Alaska state legislature passed a resolution
requesting that the park and the mountain be renamed to Denali.
Congressional hearings were held two years later. In a compromise,
the park was renamed in 1980 but the mountain retained its name.
   Negotiators from the two chambers probably will meet next month
to work out a compromise bill.
