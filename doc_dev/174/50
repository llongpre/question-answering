<MEMO>  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 6/20/91, pg. 2B);  Because of a reporter's
error, a story in some editions of Tuesday's Mercury News misstated two items
in Franklin-McKinley School District's proposed 1991-'92 budget. Grants to
encourage innovative teaching are being proposed for reduction, not
elimination. And the Gifted and Talented Education program is not being
proposed for either elimination or reduction. A proposal recommends that
unused lottery money set aside for GATE be funneled to other uses.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     (check) Eliminating grants to encourage innovative teaching.;    (check)
Eliminating the Gifted and Talented Education Program.;    (check) Cutting
back on classes with students from different grade levels. Under the teachers'
contract, such classes must be relatively small, and so cost more than regular
classes.;    (check) Shrinking the district's instrumental music program.;   
(check) Charging schools for the full cost of copying, rather than the budget
absorbing some of the cost.;    "What you see here are many, many reductions
in support services that are very important," said Assistant Superintendent
Jim Abbott. "If we continue to do this year after year, we're going to hurt
severely."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Franklin-McKinley school board will
discuss the budget at 4 p.m. in the board room at 430 Tully Road, San Jose.
The board will vote next Tuesday on the proposed budget.  </TEXT>
