   Health-conscious consumers are on a low-fat
buying craze and major dairy companies are having a cow about how
to shed tons of fatty leftovers squeezed out of milk, ice cream and
other products.
   ``As we take more fat out of our products, which consumers are
wanting more and more, you have to have a place to put it - which
we don't,'' said William D. Fischer, president and chief operating
officer of Dean Foods, the nation's second-largest dairy.
   ``We're losing half a million dollars a month'' by selling the
fat for less than it costs to remove it from the milk, he said
Tuesday.
   Dean Foods, based in suburban Franklin Park, produces about 4.4
billion pounds of fat annually and is selling it at a loss while
looking for some other way to use it.
   The largest U.S. dairy, Borden Inc. of New York, faces similar
problems, although it keeps no detailed records of the amount of
money lost this way, said Jim McKinley, manager of financial
communications.
   ``It's a problem that affects the entire dairy industry,''
McKinley said. ``Sales of low-fat products have been increasing at
a higher rate than other products.''
   Skim and low-fat milk sales accounted for about 40 percent of
the market 10 years ago, but now comprise about 60 percent,
industry analysts said.
   ``It reflects a changing consumer preference for low-fat
products,'' said John McMillan, food-industry analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``Fifteen years ago,
nobody bought low-fat and skim milk.''
   The turnaround occurred so quickly, officials said, that dairy
makers were taken by surprise and had no alternatives for getting
rid of the fat except to continue selling most of it for use in the
production of butter. Butter, however, is also shunned by health-
and cost-conscious consumers.
   ``There's now more butter on the market than we can possibly
consume,'' Fischer said. ``There's also a glut worldwide.''
   The industry has asked the federal government to ease its
predicament with legislation aimed at providing incentives for
farmers to breed cows producing low-fat milk with more protein.
   Farmers currently have no incentive to change breeding patterns
because, under federal pricing guidelines, they receive the same
amount of money no matter what fat content milk has.
   ``The new way would reward farmers for producing milk with more
protein and less fat,'' Fischer said.
   The Agriculture Department supports such legislation because its
budget is taking a beating after buying surplus butter in a
multibillion-dollar dairy price-support program.
   The government this year reported 397.5 million pounds of
stockpiled butter, purchased at a cost of $502.6 million under the
support program in which it annually buys about 10 percent of
national dairy production.
   Those costs and the price of storing the dairy products are so
high the government began giving them away to needy families in the
early 1980s. But the government began having problems giving it
away because the stockpile was so huge, said Kelly Shipp, a USDA
spokesman.
   Giveaways to schools and other agencies now help reduce the
stockpile each year, but butter still is being produced at such a
rate that the government suffers huge losses, Ms. Shipp said.
   Changes in the government's milk-marketing rules are years away,
however, she said.
   ``Unfortunately, the rules say we have to have a nationwide
hearing process and farmer referendum before we make changes,'' Ms.
Shipp said. ``We're moving as fast as we possibly can. We can't
just go out and change things tomorrow because we want to.''
   Dairy companies grumble that even after any possible changes are
drafted, it would take years before farmers could breed cows to
produce low-fat milk.
   ``This is a problem we've had for years, and each year that goes
by without a solution costs us money,'' McKinley said.
