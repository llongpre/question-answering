<TEXT>     "It was pretty tough," Taras said in a telephone interview from his home.; 
  Taras is a son of Ray Genet, a mountain-climbing guide who died in October
1979 trying to climb the world's tallest peak. A few months before his death,
Ray Genet led the previous record-holder, Mark Edwards, then 14, to McKinley's
summit.;    The group set out June 5 and reached the summit without incident,
park rangers said.;    "I'm glad it's over," said Kathy Sullivan, Taras'
mother.;    When he returned home Saturday, Taras went to bed for eight hours,
then awoke, ate and slept again, Sullivan said.;    Mount McKinley is one of
the most popular climbing peaks in the world, with about 1,000 people
attempting to reach its summit each year. Only about half of those who try
succeed.;    The peak can be the scene of violent storms, whiteout snow
conditions and winds in excess of 150 mph. Three climbers died trying to reach
the summit last year.  </TEXT>
