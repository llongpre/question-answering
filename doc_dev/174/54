   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador personally
notified President Leslie Manigat about the indictment in Miami of
Col. Jean-Claude Paul on narcotics trafficking charges, embassy
spokesman Jeffrey Lite said Monday.
   ``We have formally notified them, but have not yet revealed the
details of the case,'' Lite said. ``They will be passed along when
they're made available.''
   He said Ambassador Brunson McKinley met with Manigat Thursday,
the same day the Miami indictment was unsealed.
   Lite would not say if McKinley discussed the possible
extradition of Paul or recommended any course of action.
   The indictment accuses Paul, along with his brother and ex-wife,
of using a private airstrip to fly a 220-pound cocaine shipment to
the Bahamas for delivery to Miami.
   Paul commands the powerful Dessalines Battalion that backs up
police in this capital city with a population of 1 million.
   The indictment puts Manigat in a precarious situation. The
57-year-old political science professor came to power in a Jan. 17
election that many Haitians boycotted, foreign observers criticized
and rival candidates said was rigged by the army.
   A decision to act against Paul could provoke a coup, and if
Manigat ignores the indictment it could affect U.S. aid vital to
this impoverished Caribbean nation and its 6 million people.
   Manigat issued a statement last week through a Washington public
relations firm calling the incident ``a matter of concern'' that
will be handled in Haiti by military courts.
   Manigat is in a ``horrible situation,'' said a Western diplomat
who spoke with the condition he not be identified.
   ``Paul knows that if he goes (to the United States) he will land
in jail. He's not about to let himself be had,'' the diplomat said.
``The solution would be to bring him to trial locally. But how? Who
would you send to arrest him?'' Anaise Chavenet, a spokeswoman for
the Ministry of Information, said Monday the government has not
been officially notified about the indictment.
   ``The American government has not notified the Haitian
government by letter or through normal diplomatic channels _
through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs _ of the indictment of Col.
Paul,'' she said.
   She added she was not aware of any meeting between Manigat and
McKinley on the indictment.
