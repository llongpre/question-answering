This is a story about politics and pork rinds. Government and grapes. The 
history of the U.S. presidency bulges with interesting tales about the food 
that fueled our country's chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
If you thought that nutrition was the brainchild of the 1980s, you'll be 
surprised to learn that President James Garfield popularized the term more than 
100 years ago. Somebody had to do it. The two previous Administrations served 
almost as many courses at state dinners as there were stars on the flag. A 
typical menu wallowed in thick sauces, rich desserts and enough foreign words 
to open a language school. 
</P>
<P>
When Garfield took office, he insisted on simple, wholesome food. Guests sat 
down to such basic, no-nonsense fare as "Mrs. Garfield's White Loaf Bread" and 
"Extra-Fluffy Mashed Potatoes." Garfield's tenure lasted only a few months; 
given a chance, he might have started the oat bran fad early. 
</P>
<P>
Our country has a long, if misguided, tradition of equating rich dishes with 
elegant dining. It is probably not any President's fault that when we cook for 
company, we add whipping cream to everything but the roast. Still, some popular 
notions about entertaining date back to a time when the White House led the 
social scene. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential styles vary, but a heavy entertaining schedule seems to come with 
the territory. When George Washington was President, he held a reception every 
Tuesday, a congressional dinner each Thursday and frequent state banquets. On 
Friday nights, his wife, Martha, took over the drawing room for yet another 
gathering. Refreshments or meals were served at all these events. 
</P>
<P>
Away from the demands of their public host role, our Presidents have been 
individuals with diverse palates and a varying commitment to good health. Some 
rode horses or took brisk walks each morning. Others exercised most vigorously 
with a knife and fork. 
</P>
<P>
Like many people of their time, William and Ida McKinley believed in getting 
the day off to a substantial start. Large portions of eggs, hot breads, 
potatoes, steak or chops, fish, fruit and coffee were standard morning fare. In 
"The Presidents' Cookbook," researchers Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks say 
lunch and dinner at the McKinleys ran the rather short gamut from abundant to 
Gargantuan. 
</P>
<P>
William Howard Taft weighed 332 pounds at his inauguration. Between enormous 
meals, he nibbled salted almonds. Under doctor's orders to reduce his daily 
breakfast steak from 12 ounces to eight, Taft complied . . . when his wife was 
there to watch him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, then as now, diet was just one part of a President's life style. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to compare other ages," said Dr. John LaRosa, dean of clinical 
affairs at George Washington University's Medical School. "People lived 
differently. They walked more, and fewer people in the upper classes smoked 
cigarettes. The impact of a high-cholesterol diet may have been different." In 
fact, the rate of heart disease was actually lower, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Not since Thomas Jefferson introduced waffles and ice cream has any President 
intentionally raised eating to the level of a real issue. However, historians 
have retained enough tidbits about presidential diet to rate a separate 
category on "Jeopardy." Would-be contestants interested in boning up are 
referred to "The Presidents' Cookbook" and "The First Ladies Cook Book," with 
historical text by Margaret Klapthor Brown. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Coolidge kept crackers and preserves at his elbow for a convenient 
snack. 
</P>
<P>
James Buchanan liked grapes so much that he tended an arbor at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Zachary Taylor's three favorite foods were fried oysters, stewed oysters and 
roasted oysters. 
</P>
<P>
Ulysses S. Grant once said: "I refuse to eat anything that goes about on two 
legs." 
</P>
<P>
As executive chef for five recent presidents, Henry Haller found modern first 
families to be weight-conscious and open to nutritional advice. When 
interviewed for an article in Weight Watchers Magazine, Haller identified a 
dilemma many less-famous cooks will recognize: removing the sodium and fat from 
favorite dishes without making them taste like recipe cards. 
</P>
<P>
Haller succeeded by seasoning with herbs instead of salt and substituting 
low-fat ingredients wherever possible. That meant using bouillon instead of 
cream in chipped beef for Lyndon Johnson, who topped his Western salad with 
low-calorie dressing when dining privately. 
</P>
<P>
LBJ's hearty Texas appetite got the better of him at times. The Johnsons' 
family cook, Zephyr Wright, is said to have left a note under LBJ's plate: "Eat 
what I put in front of you, and don't ask for any more, and don't complain." 
</P>
<P>
From Southern fried chicken for the Carters to light, California cuisine for 
the Reagans, menus reflected regional tastes during Haller's 21 years on the 
job. The American palate expanded accordingly. When you think about 
presidential influence, consider how many more people now know that okra is 
something you can eat. 
</P>
<P>
Even before there was scientific evidence to back him up, Jefferson attributed 
his long life to eating many vegetables and little animal fat. One person's 
health doesn't constitute proof, but studies of whole populations suggest that 
diet contributes to the clogged arteries that can lead to heart attacks. It 
turns out that this forefather knew best. 
</P>
<P>
So how about those pork rinds, the twice-fried munchie that President Bush made 
famous? 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK to eat almost anything if the quantity doesn't break the bank as far 
as total intake of fat and cholesterol goes," LaRosa said. "You have to 
consider the total diet, not just one snack."
