   A trio of lively 101-year-olds, still
prepared to raise a glass of sherry to the Class of 1908,
celebrated their 80th class reunion Saturday at Mount Holyoke
College.
   Mount Holyoke officials said their calls to other schools and
alumni associations were unable to turn up any institution that has
had a larger group of returning students for an 80th reunion.
   Tucked into a 1955 Oldsmobile flying the class banner, the three
_ an artist, a civic leader and a psychologist _ led the annual
parade of 1,100 alumnae in white dresses across the campus of the
nation's oldest continuing women's college.
   They were followed by a pair of 97-year-olds _ Dellar Cook
Crumrine of Hamden, Conn., and Irene McIntyre Walbridge of
Peterboro, N.H., back for their 75th class reunion. Mrs. Walbridge
spent 285 days under enemy fire as a Salvation Army worker during
World War II.
   ``I wouldn't miss this for the world. It's fun and you've got to
have fun,'' said Helen Warren Smith of Cambridge, 101, who had been
vice president of the Class of 1908.
   ``The three of them were up at the crack of dawn and they
weren't being at all quiet,'' said Alumnae Association President
Kitty Rokinow of Houston.
   ``The big news when we were here was the assassination of
President William McKinley and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake,''
Mrs. Smith said. ``I remember it took so long to get any news out
of San Francico because the telegraph was gone. It was a terrible
thing.''
   ``In a few years, it won't be all that unusual to have people
our age returning for their 80th college reunion,'' said Lucy Day
Boring, 101, of Cambridge.
   At her 75th reunion five years ago, Marion C. Plack, still a
cigarette smoker, said the secret to longevity is not inhaling.
   ``I haven't given up cigarettes,'' said Miss Plack, now 101.
``But they hid them on me.''
