A squabble over a $40 debt escalated into a fight that left an Antelope Valley 
man dead and the victim's nephew in custody on suspicion of murder, authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said James H. Grissom, 24, shot and killed his uncle, Donnie Ray 
McKinley, 32, after the two argued and fought at Grissom's house in the 10100 
block of East Avenue S-14 in Lancaster late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Grissom was being held without bail at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department substation in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Bill Linnemeyer said the two men were arguing about a debt that 
McKinley, a resident of Llano, claimed Grissom owed him. The two scuffled and 
Grissom grabbed a 12-gauge shotgun and shot his uncle once in the chest, 
according to Linnemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies, answering a 911 call from a relative at the house, found 
McKinley lying in a hallway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene of the 
shooting.
