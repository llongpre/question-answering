<HEAD>Man Conquers North America's Highest Peak Solo; Lives To Talk

   An American, the first mountaineer to
conquer North America's highest peak alone in winter, left a
Japanese flag atop Mount McKinley to honor the man who tried _ and
failed _ before him.
   Vern Tejas ended a monthlong ordeal of screaming winds and
subzero temperatures on Tuesday, picked up by plane on McKinley's
flank and flown to Anchorage, 130 miles to the south.
   During the climb Tejas often thought about Japanese climber
Naomi Uemura, the only other person to reach the 20,320-foot summit
in a solo winter climb but who disappeared during his descent in
February 1984 and was never found.
   ``Many times I was wondering, `Is this where he slipped? Is this
where he lost it?' '' Tejas said Tuesday in Anchorage.
   ``I think I figured out where he bought the farm up there. There
was one area, on summit day, I was coming back down. It's very
steep, very exposed, and you feel that if you make one mistake, you
could die.''
   Tejas, a stocky 35-year-old with beard and shaved head, had
climbed McKinley 12 times, usually as a guide during the May-June
climbing season.
   Even then, in relatively milder conditions, about a third of
several hundred climbers who attempt the climb turn back short of
the summit.
   Snow-covered McKinley is infamous for hurricane-force winds that
rage for days, temperatures that dip to minus 60, and whiteouts
that make it hard to know up from down. Tejas' planned two-week
trek took a month.
   Tejas, who lives in Talkeetna, which is used as a staging area
for McKinley climbers, was dropped off Feb. 16 at the mountain's
7,200-foot level. On the second day, a storm came and kept him in
his snow cave for three days. He eventually went onto half rations,
then half rations every other day.
   ``I ended up working at my margin. It was around the edge of
safety several times.'' Twice, he found earlier climbers' food
caches that helped him survive. On March 7, he waited out a storm
and made a dash to the top during a whiteout.
   ``I couldn't see where I was going. After 12 times to the
summit, I can feel my way up to it, but it wasn't as pretty or
spectacular as I'd hoped for,'' he said.
   ``I took a few pictures, left a few mementos, turned around and
headed down. I left a Japanese flag in memory of Naomi Uemura, and
I also left a can of Spam. There was no meat in it. I ate it. I was
very hungry.''
   He made it back the same day to 17,000 feet and rested
overnight. The next day, he contacted pilot Lowell Thomas Jr. by
two-way radio and started down. Tejas appeared in good shape when
he arrived Tuesday in Anchorage, but he said the mountain had
pushed him to his mental, physical, and emotional limits.
   ``You go, `This is ridiculous. This is a hill, this is the
middle of winter, I'm a lone guy out here. There are crevasses all
around, there's danger. What am I doing here?' ''
   Safe on level ground, he answered his own question.
   ``To live in a very harsh environment, to do something very
stressful and straining like that, is a challenge,'' he said. ``I
was at the limits of my ability. It was a good test. I'd never
spent a month by myself. I found out I really liked myself.''
