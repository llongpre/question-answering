   Theodore Roosevelt boldly shaped the powers of
the presidency but wasn't too busy for nightly pillow fights with
his kids, according to a White House lecturer's fond remembrance.
   President Bush and 200 guests listened raptly to the lecture on
the ``bold, noisy, irrepressibly energetic'' 26th president on
Sunday by prize-winning biographer David McCullough.
   Bush called Roosevelt ``a favorite of mine, a man who helped
shape the modern presidency, the inexhaustible T.R.''
   The audience included congressional leaders who met afterward
with Bush to discuss future budget negotiations.
   Bush smiled broadly at House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., when
McCullough read from one letter in which Roosevelt complained he
felt ``like a stewed owl'' after dealing with members of Congress
all day.
   Roosevelt's solution to such frustrations was vigorous physical
activity, including workouts with Japanese wrestlers that left him
bruised from head to toe.
   He once marched two British visitors right through a duck pond
on the White House grounds that fortunately turned out to be only
three feet deep.
   Roosevelt, only 42 when he became president in 1901 upon the
assassination of William McKinley, was the first tennis-playing
president, as well as the first to ride in an automobile, fly in a
plane, sail on a submarine and venture abroad.
   He dispensed with the formality of being addressed as ``Your
Excellency'' and paid no heed to public opinion.
   McCullough quoted the Rough Rider as saying, ``I don't know what
they think. I just know what they ought to think.''
   When Congress objected to his sending 16 U.S. battleships on a
tour around the world, Roosevelt sent the fleet off anyway.
   ``Theodore determined that there was enough money in the
Treasury to send them halfway. So he said, `I'll send them halfway
and Congress can decide whether to appropriate the money to bring
them back again,''' said McCullough, author of ``Mornings on
Horseback,'' an account of Roosevelt's early years.
   Roosevelt was a prime participant in ``rampant, wild pillow
fights almost every night'' with his six children, the writer said.
   He went on a real-life safari after leaving office in 1909, but
his reluctance once to fire upon a small bear led a New York
toymaker to conceive a novelty item: the ``teddy'' bear.
   He set aside millions of acres for national forests and parks
and ``did more for conservation than any president before and very
few since,'' McCullough said.
   He renovated a ``somewhat creepy'' White House and scuttled
plans to fill the mansion with offices and make the president live
elsewhere.
   ``He couldn't spell worth anything,'' but read a book each night
and could quote from them years later, the author said.
   He created a stir in the South by inviting Booker T. Washington
of Tuskegee Institute as the first black dinner guest at the White
House.
   That so delighted pianist Scott Joplin that he promptly wrote
``The Strenuous Life Rag'' in Roosevelt's honor. McCullough
interrupted his narrative and had a pianist play the piece for the
East Room audience.
   ``His words, many of them, written or spoken so long ago, still
have enormous validity today,'' said McCullough.
   Among Roosevelt's sayings: ``This country will not be a
permanently good place for any of us to live unless we make it a
reasonably good place for all of us to live.'''
