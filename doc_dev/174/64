   Specially equipped military helicopters
and a medical team waited Wednesday for wind to abate enough to
allow a search for three Japanese climbers overdue on a winter
ascent of Mount McKinley.
   A twin-engine plane leased by the National Park Service
approached to within 12 miles of the 20,320-foot peak Tuesday but
was driven back by the hurricane-force wind, said John Quinley, a
park service spokesman.
   The Army plans to use Chinook helicopters in the search. The
aircraft are twin-rotor troop and cargo carriers used previously in
high-altitude rescue work.
   The three men who set out to climb North America's highest peak
last were heard from more than a week ago. They have a radio, but
efforts to contact them failed.
   Their rations probably ran out days ago, but the Park Service has
a cache of food and water at 17,200 feet, Quinley said.
   Army Maj. Sherrel Mock said officials hoped wind would subside
enough for the helicopters to reach McKinley's 17,200-foot level to
check a snow cave. If the climbers are not in the cave, an aerial
search will be conducted, Mock said.
   The missing climbers are leader Noboru Yamada, 39; Teruo Saegusa,
31, and Kozo Komatsu, 34, all of Tokyo. They began their climb Feb.
15.
