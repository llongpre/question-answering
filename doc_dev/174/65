<TEXT>     As part of a continuing effort to expose underprivileged children to the
arts, students from Franklin-McKinley School District were given a special
backstage look at ballet by San Jose-Cleveland Ballet director Dennis Nahat
and principal dancers Karen Denise Gabay and Raymond Rodriguez.;   Last
October, the ballet company and a group of drama students from Lincoln High
School formed a touring group that performed a story theater version of the
comedic ballet "Coppelia" before an estimated 2,000 students in the San Jose
Unified, Franklin-McKinley and Alum Rock school districts.;   "These may be
the only opportunities these children will ever have to experience ballet,"
said Bob Tyler, spokesman for the ballet company. "Everyone should have access
to fine arts. Everyone should have the chance to fulfill their dreams.";  
Nguyen Lee wants to be a ballerina when she grows up.;   "I want a beautiful
body. I want to look like I can float in the air," she said.;   Appearing
larger than life to Lee and the 100 or so other students who sat cross-legged
at the Center for Performing Arts, dancers Gabay and Rodriguez mesmerized the
children as they demonstrated basic ballet steps.;   "Ooooh, that's baaaad,"
sang a chorus of spike-haired boys as Gabay performed a pirouette.;   Led by
Nahat, the children then took turns practicing their first, second and third
positions.;   Nahat singled out a couple of boys with potential.;   If it
weren't for Rodriguez's sisters, who encouraged him to take dance lessons at
an early age, he most likely would not have become a ballet dancer, he said.; 
 "I was not exposed to ballet. It wasn't anything my family ever talked
about," said the New York native and son of Puerto Rican immigrants.;   Gabay,
who is married to Rodriguez, first took ballet lessons through a parks and
recreation program offered by the city of San Diego.  </TEXT>
