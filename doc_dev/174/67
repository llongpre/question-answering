<LEADPARA>  Last year Rod Cryer rode a bicycle 2,700 miles cross-country, from Oceanside
in California to St. Simon in Georgia, extracting a pledge of a penny for each
mile he rode from friends.;    Last week, he raffled off a getaway weekend for
two at San Jose's Fairmont Hotel.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Between the two annual fund-raisers, Cryer, principal of McKinley
Neighborhood School, is now $5,500 closer to his goal: a college scholarship
fund for the immigrant and refugee youngsters from all over the globe who
flood his school each year.;    He says they arrive in his school as on a
beachhead, making their first toehold in the United States. And while they're
with him, he wants to plant the dream of a college education in their minds.; 
  Here's his scheme: Raise $20,000 by 1997 to endow a scholarship fund. Each
year, choose two McKinley fifth-graders to receive $1,500 each if they make it
to college seven years later. Pay the youngsters off from the endowment.;   
"It doesn't seem like much when you think of this world of thousands, but you
have to start somewhere," said Cryer, who in some senses seems to be running a
ministry as much as a school.;    "I want to dangle a carrot out there, hoping
a family will see, 'This child really does have potential.' ";    With last
year's bike-athon, he raised $4,500. Last week's raffle brought in another
$1,000, with the Fairmont Hotel donating the getaway weekend. He does his
fund-raising almost exclusively among his network of friends and associates.
He says he refuses to ask the parents of his students for money, because most
of them are too poor.;    "There are parents who've come to me because they
didn't have cash to get their clothes washed at the laundromat . . . I do not
regularly go to them to raise money.";    The children in McKinley School are
67 percent Hispanic and 23 percent Asian. Of the Asians, most are refugees
from Cambodia. The majority of the kids come from families who receive welfare
aid. Some live in extended families of 15 people to a two-bedroom apartment.
Immigrants and refugees, they find entry-level housing and a first foothold in
the neighborhood surrounding McKinley School.;    Last year, the school chose
its first two scholarship winners: a student from Cambodia and one from the
back hills of Mexico.;    "Both came not speaking English, and in two years
they were . . . getting straight A's.";    Cryer said one of the students, who
did not have a mother, achieved this success despite having to be a mother to
her siblings as well as a student at school.;    "She got up in the morning
and dressed and fed the kids before she went off to school, after doing her
homework the night before. I'll put my money on that gal.";    This year's
scholarship winners are scheduled to be announced in June, before the school
closes.  </TEXT>
