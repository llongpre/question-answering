   Seventeen Americans served as state or
territorial governors before becoming president, although most also
held senior elected or appointed federal office before winning the
White House.
   The two most recent exceptions are Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan. Michael Dukakis hopes to become a third.
   The list of former governors who became president includes some
of the most distinguished chief executives and some who are
scarcely remembered.
   Thomas Jefferson, who was governor of Virginia during the
American Revolution, tops the list. Jefferson, the third president,
doubled the size of the nation by purchasing the Louisiana
territory from France in 1803.
   He had some training along the way, being principle author of
the Declaration of Independence, negotiating the peace treaty with
Great Britain, then serving as ambassador to France and secretary
of state.
   James Monroe, another Virginia governor, became the fifth
president after serving in the U.S. Senate, as envoy to France,
Britain and Spain, and as secretary of war and state.
   Andrew Jackson was territorial governor of Florida four years
after defeating the Seminole Indians in that state.
   His successor, Martin Van Buren, was governor of New York after
serving in the U.S. Senate, and was Jackson's secretary of state
and vice president.
   Other 19th century presidents who had been governors include
William Henry Harrison of Indiana, John Tyler of Virginia, James
Knox Polk and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, Rutherford B. Hayes of
Ohio, and Grover Cleveland of New York.
   William McKinley, the 25th president, was governor of Ohio for
1892-96.
   Theodore Roosevelt, who was vice president and took office after
McKinley's assassination, had been assistant Navy secretary before
resigning in 1897 to organize the Rough Riders in the
Spanish-American War. He was governor of New York for 1899-1901.
   Woodrow Wilson, who had graduate degrees in law and political
science, was president of Princeton University before serving as
governor of New Jersey in 1911-13. He was elected president in 1912
and invaded Mexico in 1914, the year that World War I began in
Europe. He was re-elected in 1916 with the slogan, ``He Kept Us Out
of War,'' but declared war on Germany the following year.
   Calvin Coolidge served as governor of Massachusetts for 1919-20
and for 1921-23 was vice president to Warren Harding, who died in
office.
   Franklin Delano Roosevelt was governor of New York for 1929-33,
after serving as assistant Navy Secretary in 1913-20, a post which
deeply involved him in diplomacy and logistics in World War I and
prepared him for his leadership role in World War II.
   Jimmy Carter served for one term as governor of Georgia before
his election as president in 1976.
   Ronald Reagan, a two-term California governor, defeated Carter
in 1980.
