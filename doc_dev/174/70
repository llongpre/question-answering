<LEADPARA>  When Franklin-McKinley school officials said they needed a new headquarters,
people in the financially strapped San Jose elementary district expected
something modest.;   But four years and $7.4 million later, district officials
and community agencies moved into what critics caustically call the "pink
palace" -- a pink-and-purple renovated warehouse off Senter Road replete with
columns, skylights, $60-a-gallon paint in the bathrooms and $663 wall-light
sconces in the board room. And for the superintendent, a private bathroom with
shower.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now district officials are facing new critics: State officials who say the
work should never have been done.;   Officials at the state Allocation Board,
which administers the state school building fund, say Franklin-McKinley got
approval to sell only one of the three properties whose proceeds will be used
to finance the new headquarters purchase and renovation. And they say even the
money from that sale could -- and perhaps should -- have been spent on the
district's deteriorating schools.;   District officials, who defend the Wool
Creek Drive building as a showcase for Franklin-McKinley, tell a different
story of their dealings with the state.;   Superintendent Dolores Ballesteros
insisted that Franklin-McKinley got every approval state officials said was
needed -- and that the district was told it must either spend the money on a
new headquarters or lose it.;   "We feel very comfortable with our
documentation," Ballesteros said.;   The district, however, has not provided
the Mercury News with documentation resolving the dispute despite repeated
requests.;   The Allocation Board staff, meanwhile, is considering what to do
next.;   "When they have substantial needs for schools, I doubt we're going to
go along" with approving the new headquarters, said Lyle Smoot, the Allocation
Board's assistant executive officer.;   His boss, Executive Officer Bill Van
Gundy, said the board could require Franklin-McKinley to restore all or part
of the $7.4 million to district accounts that go toward building or
maintaining schools. From there the money would be applied to a laundry list
of school needs from new roofs to new paint.;   Even before the flap with the
state, some parents and teachers were furious at what they consider the new
headquarters' opulence.;   "Nothing in my classroom costs $660," said Bob
Brinkerhoff, a sixth-grade teacher in a portable classroom at Kennedy School,
referring to the wall-light sconces.;   Deteriorating buildings;   The
equivalent of two schools' worth of children sit in 75 portable classrooms in
the 10,000-student district. Others learn in buildings with leaky roofs and
faulty heating.;   Nevertheless, the district spent about $43 a square foot
improving 80,000 square feet in its half-office, half-warehouse headquarters,
according to a Mercury News analysis. In just the office space, it spent more
than $70 a square foot. The analysis omits the cost of the land, the warehouse
shell, exterior improvements and work specific to the district's needs that
cannot be compared to similar buildings.;   Still, two commercial real estate
executives characterized the cost as high.;   "I can't believe this," said
Barry Turkus, a partner in Blickman Turkus, a commercial real estate brokerage
firm. "They must have done something extraordinary there. Law firms that have
marble floors in their entryways do it for that kind of money.";   "That's a
whole lot of money," said Norm Hulberg, president of San Jose-based Hulberg
Associates Inc., a commercial real estate appraiser. "If they ever moved out,
they could forget about getting 50 cents on the dollar back.";   He said $20 a
square foot would have bought a "modest" building, and $50 a square foot a
"fantastic" one. Nevertheless, he declined to say whether the district had
spent too much.;   "That's a social question rather than a real estate
question," Hulberg said.;   District officials say the renovation price was
reasonable.;   "Initially this building had only one window," said project
designer Kristine Agardi of the Steinberg Group. "For warehousing that's fine
. . . but you can't put people into a hole.";   District's 'hands tied';  
More significantly, however, the district insists its hands were tied by the
very state officials who say they never granted approval.;   To pay for its
headquarters, the district sold its old office on Lucretia Avenue for $2.8
million and has two vacant lots at its middle schools on the market.;   "They
(the state Board of Education) sent us a waiver saying, 'Yes, you may sell
this property but you must use it to build the district office. If you don't,
the money's ours,' " Superintendent Ballesteros said in a November interview.;
  Ballesteros also said that the Allocation Board staff repeatedly told the
district that it needed approval only from the state Board of Education.;  
But the Allocation Board's Van Gundy denied this. What's more, he and state
education board staff members both said the education board's approval deals
only with the sale's technicalities and not the sale itself. In short,
permission for the sale had to come from the Allocation Board, they said.;  
And Van Gundy said the district got his board's approval to sell only the
first property and that it never got permission to spend the money from any of
the properties on a new headquarters.;   The Allocation Board must approve the
sales, he said, because the state school building fund paid for two district
schools. The board now has a lien on all district property, so that it can
ensure any money Franklin-McKinley makes from selling property goes to
improving its schools.;   "We assume the highest and best use of (these) funds
is for classrooms first and administration second," Van Gundy said.;   No
immediate solution;   Just what will happen next is unclear. Until its
remaining two properties sell, the district is borrowing money by means of
certificates of participation, in which investors buy temporary holdings in
the headquarters building.;   If the district asks the Allocation Board to
approve its three property sales retroactively, Smoot said, the board may well
turn it down. Franklin-McKinley has applied to the state school building fund
for $15 million to build new schools and an additional $6.2 million to
maintain and modernize existing schools, Smoot said. The money isn't currently
available, he added.;   The board could ask the district to replace all or
part of the $7.4 million back into its account to improve its schools. But
that money may not be there.;   "How do you extract money out of an entity
that doesn't have money?" Van Gundy asked.;   Whatever the outcome, it is not
likely to satisfy critics who are skewering the rose-colored headquarters as
the "pink palace," "Pepto-Dismal," "Mary Kay International," the "pink
elephant" and the "board-ello.";   They hold that Franklin-McKinley could have
forgone such features as four colors of interior trim, a gabled skylight atop
a central atrium, a mezzanine facing into the atrium, an elevator to access
the mezzanine and more skylights in a central corridor.;   Meanwhile, at some
schools, such as J.W. Fair, the heat sometimes fails on cold winter days. When
it does, children, many of whom are poor, cannot always add layers.;   Said
Kathy Doi, a sixth-grade teacher at the school: "Many of our children don't
come with coats, or even with heavy socks."; FRANKLIN-MCKINLEY'S NEW
HEADQUARTERS; TOTAL COSTS; In 1989, Franklin-McKinley bought the land and
warehouse shell at 645 Wool Creek Drive in San Jose for its headquarters. It
converted the shell into office space, a warehouse and shop area. It also
added 10,000 square feet of unimproved space that it plans to lease.;         
                                   Cost; Land (3.3 acres)

has 13 schools an average of 23 years old. To relieve overcrowding, the
schools have 75 portable classrooms. State officials say the $7.4 million

       $5.1 million; Modernize schools                   $1.1 million; ...;
