   Three British climbers were killed in a
fall on Mount McKinley, the National Park Service said Friday.
   Spokesman John Quinley said their bodies were found at the
15,000-foot level of North America's tallest peak shortly after
noon Thursday. He said they apparently fell about 3,000 feet.
   Quinley identified the climbers as Chris Massey, 39, of Reading,
England; John Lang, 45, of Chorley, England; and Julian Dixon, 37,
of Cambria. He said Massey was the team leader.
   The trio last was seen at the 18,000-foot level of the
20,320-foot peak Wednesday afternoon by a team of park rangers.
Quinley said the rangers decided to descend because of poor
visibility and winds gusting to 45 mph.
   Quinley said the rangers were unable to persuade the British
group to turn back. But at some point Wednesday night, the team
apparently started back down to their camp at 16,000 feet, he said.
   Thursday morning, climbers at the medical research camp at the
14,200-foot level spotted what they thought was a body at the
bottom of a steep gully known as the Orient Express, Quinley said.
   Ranger Roger Robinson, medical camp personnel and private
climbers investigated and found the bodies, he said. The bodies
were taken down to the medical camp, and will be taken off the
mountain later, Quinley said.
   Earlier this year, three Japanese climbers were killed while
trying to make a winter ascent of the mountain.
   Quinley said there are almost 400 climbers on the mountain. May
and June are the most popular months for McKinley expeditions
because weather conditions are most favorable.
