   Two firefighters were suspended for
allegedly manhandling and threatening a fire official because of
the graduation of black and women rookies in the racially troubled
fire department.
   The Fire Commission on Saturday suspended Anthony Serpa, a
12-year veteran, for six days and Walter Glynn, an 18-year veteran,
for four days, as part of a plea bargain. Both will lose up to
$1,500 in pay, officials said.
   The two, who allegedly were drunk at the time of the incident
Nov. 10, also will be dispatched to a different station daily for
the next eight months as part of the agreement.
   The incident in a bar came at a time of department tensions
prompted by the hiring and recruitment of minorities and women.
Incidents such as the discovery of a swastika near the desk of two
minority firefighters led to a call for an FBI civil rights
investigation and the resignation of Chief Edward Phipps.
   The ``very heated confrontation'' occurred after more than a
dozen firefighters had been drinking following a station banquet,
said Capt. Michael McKinley, who led the department's investigation.
   Training division Chief Fred Postel and training Capts. Elmer
Ballard and Alberto da Cuhuna entered the bar. The men told Postel
that ``he was letting people by in training who weren't
qualified,'' McKinley said.
   ``Clearly, they were way out of bounds'' in the incident in
which they threatened Postel, poked him in the ribs, cursed and
manhandled him when he tried to leave, McKinley said.
   The department withdrew charges of violence, disobedience,
insubordination and acts detrimental to the fire department's
welfare, he said.
