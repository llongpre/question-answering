   Credit card disclosure rules taking effect
today offer the nation's 107 million card holders a new opportunity
to shop around for lower interest rates, consumer activists say.
   Industry analysts, however, say they expect the new rules to have
little impact _ at least over the short haul.
   The regulations, adopted by the Federal Reserve Board in April,
require credit card issuers to disclose the interest rate, monthly
fee, grace period and other terms in a chart on applications used to
sign up customers.
   Previously, the card's costs did not have to be disclosed until
it arrived in the mail.
   The new rules also require companies to notify existing customers
in advance when their accounts are about to be renewed and another
annual fee charged.
   ``Consumers should use the renewal notice as a reminder to switch
cards and save,'' said Elgie Holstein, director of the Bankcard
Holders of America, a consumer group. He advised cardholders to pay
off their high-rate cards with a cash advance from a low-rate card.
   The new rules apply to bank cards, such as Visa, MasterCard and
Discover; to department store cards; and also to cards such as
American Express and Diners Club, whose full balance must be paid
monthly.
   ``I'm very hopeful that this will at least provide the edge to
consumers to make better judgments,'' said Peggy Miller, a lobbyist
for the Consumer Federation of America.
   Miller and other consumer activists believe the regulations
should force card companies to compete by lowering their interest
rates and annual fees.
   Bankers and analysts, however, say most cardholders probably
won't see much decline.
   ``It's going to put some strain on banks charging above-market
rates ... and some of the banks that have extremely low rates may
see a little more business, but the vast majority are going to stay
where they are,'' said Robert H. Burke, senior vice president of the
Bank of New York.
   ``I don't think it's going to do much of anything,'' agreed
Robert B. McKinley, publisher and editor of RAM Research's Bankcard
Update, a Frederick, Md., newsletter that follows the industry.
   McKinley said competition has increased in the past several
years, but rates are still high, even in the dozen or so states such
as California and New York that have their own disclosure laws.
   Nationally, cards offered by banks had average interest rates of
18.28 percent in August and an average annual fee of $16.97, he said.
   One reason interest rates are not lower is the growing
concentration of the industry as large institutions buy out smaller
credit card operations, said McKinley. Another is that consumers
don't appear to pay much attention to interest rates.
   Economists attribute the indifference to interest rates in part
to the fact that most people intend to pay off their entire bill
each month, avoiding interest charges. But a substantial portion
don't follow through on their good intentions.
   Credit card rates became a political issue in the early 1980s
when short-term interest rates soared above 20 percent. Consumer
groups sought disclosure rules and federal caps on the rates, but
made little headway until they dropped their demand for caps.
   Although earlier disclosure of card terms should help card
shoppers, McKinley said it still won't be easy to find cards with
the lowest rates.
   Big national operations, which do the most advertising and mail
solicitation, generally charge higher rates and fees. The best
bargains often come from banks and savings institutions that, at
most, advertise only regionally.
   McKinley said consumers should decide whether they will use it
for convenience or to borrow. Cardholders who pay their entire
balance monthly should look for a card with a low annual fee, or no
fee. However, those who carry balances of $1,000 or more may find it
cheaper to pay a fee in exchange for a lower rate.
   He lists some gimmicks that consumers should beware of, even with
the new rules:
   _Some cards with no annual fee compensate by charging interest
rates of more than 20 percent. The annual fee often is waived only
for the first year.
   _Other cards offer skip-a-payment options, but tack on added
interest costs to the next bill.
   _Cards with low rates compensate by charging high annual fees or
allow no grace period, assessing interest from the day of purchase.
Others advertise ``cost-saving'' variable rates that wind up being
substantially higher than national averages for fixed rates.
   _Some banks offer a lower annual fee or an interest-rate break,
but only if customers maintain a checking account that carries a $5
or $6 a month service charge.
   _Other companies tout 1 percent rebates on purchases, but charge
interest rates 3 to 4 percentage points higher than most cards.
