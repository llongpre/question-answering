   Gerber Products Co.'s chairman and chief executive officer said he generally agreed with analysts' forecasts that the company will post lower profit for its fiscal fourth quarter. 

   Analysts' estimates that the company earned about 50 cents to 55 cents a share for the quarter ended yesterday are generally "accurate," William L. McKinley said. 
Year-earlier profit was 60 cents a share. 
Mr. McKinley attributed the profit decline to a variety of factors, including the "very substantial" cost of a stepped-up advertising and promotion campaign in Gerber's baby food business. 

   In the year-ago fourth quarter, Gerber earned $12.3 million on sales of $242.7 million. 
Mr. McKinley estimated that sales in the quarter just ended increased to more than $280 million. 

   He said analysts' estimates that the baby products company will report profit for the fiscal year of about $1.75 to $1.80 a share are "reasonable." 
Sales for the year were more than $1 billion. 

   In fiscal 1986, Gerber had profit of $45.5 million, or $2.23 a share, on sales of $967.9 million. 
Net income included a charge of $4.2 million for a plant closing. 

   Mr. McKinley said the advertising and promotions campaign was launched to counter a consumer scare early last year when a wave of allegations about glass shards in the company's baby food surfaced. 
The complaints never were tied to Gerber's production process, Mr. McKinley said. 
He added that the number of complaints have dwindled to "nothing outside the normal." 

   Mr. McKinley said some small charges associated with the restructuring of Gerber's furniture business also hurt fourth-quarter profit. 
"I'm not talking more than a few cents a share, but it will adversely affect this quarter," he said. 

   The chief executive said the company's transportation group, which includes a trucking business, "isn't part of our long-term growth strategy," though he wouldn't say what the company plans to do with the business. 

   Mr. McKinley wouldn't comment on whether the company plans any change in its 33-cent-a-share quarterly dividend. 
He said the company isn't expecting to pursue any new financing in the near term and has "nothing major" planned in the way of acquisitions.
