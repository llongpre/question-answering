<LEADPARA>  If debate over a city's history is a sign of maturity, then San Jose has aged
considerably in the year since a statue of an early 19th-century mayor was
proposed as a heroic centerpiece for its downtown.;    Now, while the bronze
figure of Capt. Thomas Fallon bringing the Stars and Stripes to San Jose sits
shrouded in an Oakland warehouse, city officials, arts activists and
historians have come up with four more commemorative subjects in a plan to
defuse the Fallon flap and please those who view his statue as an affront to
Hispanics.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The subjects, produced by a citizens' committee after months of hearings,
are:;    (check) "The Ohlone way of life," referring to Santa Clara Valley's
first settlers.;    (check) "The founding of the Pueblo San Jose de
Guadalupe," which marks California's first Hispanic civil settlement on Nov.
29, 1777.;    (check) "Agriculture," the major industry before the advent of
Silicon Valley.;    (check) "Ernesto Galarza," longtime city resident, scholar
and organizer of California farmworkers.;    Officials hope the resulting
works -- either murals, sculptures or non-traditional forms -- can be
commissioned and on display with the Fallon statue by the end of 1995.;    The
timing is a matter of debate. Some say the Fallon statue should go up quickly
in its newly chosen spot near Pellier Park, now a desolate traffic island at
the confluence of Julian and St. James streets and Route 87. Others say it can
wait.;    "There is a commitment not to unveil the Fallon until there are two
or three other pieces," said Mayor Susan Hammer, who will vote with the city
council Tuesday on the art subjects and, in all likelihood, approve them. No
cost estimates have been made.;    The urge to commemorate seems to have
caught San Jose's fancy, in a lively fusion of history, art and politics.;   
When the downtown convention center was renamed in April for former Mayor Tom
McEnery, who was at the center of the Fallon storm last year, Galarza's name
was floated by McEnery critics as a possible substitute. Veterans, too, are
seeking a memorial; they failed with both the convention center and the
historic art committee, but will probably succeed soon.;    This historical
consciousness is a marked change in a city where the most recognizable
commemorative works are a bas-relief of a Civil and Mexican war veteran, Henry
Morris Naglee, and a statue of William McKinley. The bronzed figure of the
assassinated president sits in St. James Park, a howitzer at his feet pointing
across First Street, as much a symbol of San Jose as James Garfield -- sitting
in Golden Gate Park -- is to San Francisco.  </TEXT>
