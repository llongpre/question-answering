   The National Park Service requested help
from the Army as fears mounted that three Japanese climbers trying
to make a winter ascent of Mount McKinley were near death somewhere
near the summit.
   The Park Service on Tuesday said little can be done until
hurricane-force winds buffeting the 20,320-foot peak abate.
   The climbers have not been heard from in more than a week and are
believed to have run out of food six days ago, said John Quinley, a
park service spokesman. The men have a radio but have made no
contact, he said.
   The Army has Chinook helicopters specially equipped for
high-altitude rescues, but they are not expected to be able to fly
until Thursday or Friday because of the wind, Quinley said.
   An Army plane circled the mountain repeatedly on Monday,
broadcasting messages, but received no response from the climbers,
Quinley said.
   Quinley said park rangers believe the climbers could be holed up
in a snow cave somewhere between 17,000 feet and the summit of Mount
McKinley, North America's highest peak.
   He said there is also concern that the men have run out of fuel
needed to melt snow. Without water, they could quickly succumb to
dehydration and hypothermia.
   McKinley, because of its location near the Arctic Circle, is
judged to be one of the most difficult winter climbs.
   ``Based on what they took, they're six days out of food,''
Quinley said. ``But the park service has a cache at 17,200,
apparently fairly close to where they would be camped, and there's
food and fuel there.''
   The National Weather Service reported sustained winds of 60 mph
to 100 mph in the area. Climbing ranger Bob Seibert of Talkeetna
estimated those winds reach 90 mph to 200 mph as they funnel through
passes in the mountains.
   He identified the missing climbers as 39-year-old Noboru Yamada,
the group leader, 31-year-old Teruo Saegusa and 34-year-old Kozo
Komatsu, all of Tokyo.
