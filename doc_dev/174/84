   Should he be hoisted by his own petard, George
Herbert Walker Bush will begin his presidency with one of the sorest
arms in history.
   About 35,000 little American flags will be distributed to
spectators at his inaugural Friday. At least 700 larger flags will
be carried before him in the hours-long parade to follow.
   Can the man who espoused the pledge of allegiance to the flag
with religious fervor in the last campaign get by with just an
occasional salute? With all those flags, just a token movement of
the arm toward the heart could leave Bush with the sorest arm since
Sandy Koufax quit baseball.
   The marching band from the University of Texas alone could wear
out the new president. Its 320 marchers will carry 30 flags along
with 60 trumpets, 40 trombones, 20 baritones, 24 tubas, 26
percussion, 36 clarinet, 30 french horns, 25 saxophones and 24
piccolos. Can a man from Texas stand motionless before all that?
   The statistics come courtesy of the inaugural committee, which
produced a handbook of breathtaking scope. It tells far more than
you could possibly want to know about inaugurals in compelling
detail. For example:
   Bush and the six presidents before him were all born between 1908
and 1924, a fact the need of which is not yet clear.
   Bush will rank with the four tallest presidents in history,
behind Abe Lincoln, Lyndon Johnson and Thomas Jefferson. He also
will enter history books as one of four left-handed presidents, the
others being James Garfield, Harry Truman and Gerald Ford.
   The dome of the Capitol expands and contracts as much as four
inches because of the heat of the sun by day and cooling by night,
which is in sharp contrast to most of its tenants who are known to
expand frequently and contract seldom.
   Mrs. William Howard Taft was the first woman to ride in an
inaugural parade in 1913. Warren Harding was the first president to
ride to his swearing-in in a car. Richard Nixon was the first to
review his parade behind bullet-proof glass.
   Bush is 31st among college graduates who made it to the White
House, 12th among Phi Beta Kappa boys, second among Yale men.
   Married 44 years, George and Barbara Bush bring the ninth longest
marriage to the White House. John and Abigail Adams were married the
longest, 54 years and three days. But Bush is the only president
born in June.
   You will also sleep better knowing that Andrew Johnson was the
only vice president visibly drunk at his inaugural, a condition he
blamed on alcohol consumed to combat the pain of typhoid fever.
   Should you need more for your next game of Trivial Pursuit,
remember Jefferson had the first running water in the White House,
from a cistern he put in the roof; Millard Fillmore had the first
bathtub installed; Rutherford Hayes, the first telephone; William
McKinley, the first elevator; Franklin Roosevelt, the first
dishwasher.
   But George Herbert Walker Bush will be the first captain of a
Yale baseball team to become president. Indisputably.
