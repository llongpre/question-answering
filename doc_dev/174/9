   Former President Reagan, who admits to having a
superstitious nature, has all the same escaped a jinx that has long
haunted certain presidents.
   Reagan remains alive at the end of his presidency, even though he
was first elected in a year ending with zero.
   For nearly a century and a half, every president elected in such
a year had died in office. Reagan, despite a brush with cancer and
an assassination attempt, was the first to break the jinx.
   William Henry Harrison, elected in 1840, died of pneumonia at the
age of 67 a month after taking office.
   Abraham Lincoln, elected in 1860, was assassinated in 1865 at the
age of 56.
   James A. Garfield, elected in 1880, was assassinated a few months
later at the age of 50.
   William McKinley, re-elected in 1900, was assassinated in 1901 at
the age of 58.
   Warren G. Harding, elected in 1920, died of a heart attack in
1923 at the age of 58.
   Franklin D. Roosevelt, elected to his third term in 1940, died of
a cerebral hemmorhage in 1945 at the age of 63.
   John F. Kennedy, elected in 1960, was assassinated in 1963 at the
age of 46.
   Reagan, 77, survived an assassination attempt outside a
Washington hotel in 1981 and underwent successful surgery for cancer
of the colon in 1985.
   Reagan has often invoked superstitious beliefs from the world of
show business and sports and declined to disavow first lady Nancy
Reagan's reliance on astrology.
