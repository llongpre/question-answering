   Edward B. Vallens, a 67-year-old retired contractor, is an avowed anti-Zionist. 
Just how he wound up with $120,000 -- much of it from Jewish contributors -- to stage a television blitz in the final hours of the 1986 California Senate race still bothers him. 

   The $120,000 might seem like a small amount in a race that consumed $24 million and is believed to be the most expensive Senate race in history. 
But it is part of a larger story that might have affected the outcome of the close, bitter race between Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston and his unsuccessful GOP challenger, then-Rep. 
Edwin Zschau. 

   A key figure in the story appears to be Michael Goland, a Los Angeles developer who is one of the largest donors to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and who has been active in opposing candidates he views as being unfriendly to Israel. 
He recently agreed to pay a $5,000 fine for his role in running television commercials attacking former GOP Sen. Charles Percy of Illinois in Mr. Percy's losing 1984 race; the commercials were illegal because the source of the financing wasn't disclosed. 

   Mr. Goland, who couldn't be reached for comment, surfaced in the California race at a May 1986 reception for Mr. Zschau held by Jewish supporters in Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley. 
According to the accounts of both Mr. Zschau and campaign manager Ron Smith, he confronted the candidate and, in Mr. Smith's words, "said, 'I'm going to get you just like I got Percy.'" 

   A few weeks later, Mark Barnes, the operator of a Los Angeles political consulting firm, was approached to produce and buy time for a television ad for Mr. Vallens, the Senate candidate of the American Independent Party. 
Mr. Barnes says he can't divulge who his clients were. 

   About that time, Libertarian Party candidate Breck McKinley says he received a call from Mr. Barnes, who said he represented some potential contributors. 
Mr. McKinley says that when he pressed for more information, Mr. Barnes said he was working on behalf of Mr. Goland. 
Mr. Barnes confirms that he called Mr. McKinley but denies mentioning Mr. Goland's name. 
Mr. McKinley says he rejected the offer. 

   Mr. Vallens says that in mid-October, as his campaign struggled along with a few thousand dollars, he received a call from Mr. Barnes promising $120,000 from "very conservative Republicans who don't want Zschau in there." 
Mr. Vallens was told to go to a Los Angeles television studio, where he made commercials asserting that he, and not Mr. Zschau, was the only real conservative in the race. 

   The commercials ran at least 60 times on Los Angeles and San Diego stations in the final hours before the election. 
Mr. Vallens, hitherto a political unknown, got 109,856 votes. 
Mr. Smith claims the ads siphoned off Zschau votes and depressed voter turnout in heavily Republican Orange County. 
Mr. Zschau lost the election by 116,000 votes. 

   The Los Angeles Times found two of the donors worked for companies controlled by Mr. Goland and another who lived in a house that is owned by Mr. Goland. 
One $4,000 check came from Mr. and Mrs. Michael Altman. 
Mr. Altman says he is a close friend of Mr. Goland's and that he is treasurer of Young Americans Political Action Committee, a pro-Israel PAC of which Mr. Goland is assistant treasurer. 

   Asked specifically in a second call about the donation to Mr. Vallens, Mr. Altman, who operates a Sherman Oaks insurance agency, was much less expansive. 
"I don't want to talk about it," he says. 
"This has caused me nothing but grief. 
We got some misinformation. 
Let's just leave it at that."
