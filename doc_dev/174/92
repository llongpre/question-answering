<LEADPARA>  For the sixth time since February, the board of San Jose's Franklin-McKinley
School District considered a proposal to add seventh and eighth grades to
Stonegate Elementary School.;    And for the sixth time, the board failed to
put the issue to bed.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At its Tuesday meeting, a motion to approve the Stonegate proposal went
aground on a tie vote. Board members Lolita Foster and Ronald Masuda voted
yes; Robin Rogers and Pearle Woodall voted no; Francisco Dominguez was out of
town.;    It was an outcome that left those on either side of the emotionally
charged issue united in one thing: weariness.;    The Stonegate proposal was
first suggested by district staff members in February. They put it forth as a
means of stopping what they said was a flight of students from
Franklin-McKinley's two middle schools, J.W. Fair and Sylvandale. The idea was
to raise extra dollars for the district by doing a better job of luring back
students who had left and hanging on to the students whose parents were
threatening to leave.;    At each of the six meetings, supporters warned that
many students fall through the cracks in the larger middle-school environment.
They said the smaller, more sheltered environment of a seventh and eighth
grade at Stonegate would help retain these students before they either left
the district or risked failing.;    Opponents charged the Stonegate proposal
was a slap in the face of the district's two middle schools. They said passing
it would be capitulating to perceptions that J.W. Fair and Sylvandale are
unsafe, non-nurturing schools with weak academic programs.;    Because of
Tuesday's tie vote, the board is scheduled to discuss the issue yet again,
once Dominguez returns to town.;    "We've been hanging out since February,"
said Stonegate Principal Stephen Kay, who supports the idea. "And now we're
right back where we were then."  </TEXT>
