New Jersey investor and horse racing enthusiast John Aglialoro reached an 
agreement that could make him the new owner of Canterbury Downs, a race track 
in Shakopee, about 40 miles southwest near Minneapolis. For $4 million to $5 
million, Aglialoro agreed to purchase the stock owned by Canterbury president 
Brooks Fields Jr., Fields' nephew Brooks Hauser and Santa Anita Realty 
Enterprises Inc. of Los Angeles.

Aglialoro faces purchasing the track's $43-million mortgage and must obtain an 
operating license from the Minnesota Racing Commission, his attorney, John 
Broeker, said.

Without an infusion of cash, Canterbury won't operate this year, Royce 
McKinley, chairman and chief executive officer of Santa Anita Enterprises, and 
Hauser said. The track has lost $70 million since it was built in 1985, helping 
to drive the real estate firm shared by Hauser and Fields into U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court, where it is being reorganized under Chapter 11. McKinley said Santa 
Anita Enterprises has lost $17.5 million on the venture and would get 45% of 
Aglialoro's purchase price.
