   In the days before newspapers had the ability
to print photographs, special artists were dispatched to great
national events _ including presidential inaugurals _ to record the
event on sketch pads.
   That era is recalled, in these days before the inauguration of
George Bush as the nation's 41st president, in a small Capitol
exhibit.
   It displays the views that artists for ``Harper's Weekly,''
``Frank Leslie's Illustrated News'' and other publications provided
of the inauguration of every president from 1853 to 1905.
   Entitled ``Hail To The Chief,'' the exhibit also recalls the
circumstances that gave each of those ceremonies its own flavor.
   An 1853 sketch shows President-elect Franklin Pierce and outgoing
President Millard Fillmore striding through the Capitol Rotunda on
the way to the inaugural platform on the East Front, the traditional
site of inaugurals until President Reagan took the oath of office on
the West Front in 1981.
   Pierce's vice president, William King, was sworn in by the U.S.
counsel in Havana, the only president or vice president-elect ever
to take the oath of office outside the United States.
   Convalescing from a serious illness, King died six weeks later.
   Pierce objected on religious grounds from swearing his oath. He
exercised an option permitted him by the Constitution and affirmed
it instead. He is the only president to have done that.
   The drawing of James Buchanan's inauguration in 1857 shows the
scaffolding and hoists being used to build the new Senate wing of
the Capitol.
   By the time Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated four years later the
new high dome of the Capitol is shown half completed. By the time of
Lincoln's second inauguration in 1865 the dome is complete, crowned
with the statue of Armed Freedom on top.
   An 1861 illustration shows Lincoln and Buchanan en route to the
Capitol in an open carriage, passing a shop sign reading ``Great
Book Sale.''
   The exhibit's text recalls that when Lincoln reached the
inaugural stand, he could not find a place to put his ``hallmark
stove pipe hat.''
   Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's unsuccessful rival for the presidency,
reached out his hand for it.
   ``If I cannot be president, at least I can hold his hat,'' he
said.
   In 1869 the nation's preeminent war hero, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant,
was sworn in as president and his predecessor, Andrew Johnson, broke
a precedent,
   Insulted by Grant's refusal to accompany him on the traditional
ride down Pennsylvania Avenue, Johnson refused to take part in the
inaugural ceremonies.
   The general served two scandal-plagued terms and the 1877
inaugural drawing shows him looking on as Rutherford B. Hayes takes
the oath.
   Hayes, a Republican, had lost the popular vote to Democrat Samuel
J. Tilden but some Electoral College votes were in dispute.
   The issue was settled by a special commission and the nod went to
Hayes.
   Since March 4, the date of presidential inaugurations in that
era, fell on a Sunday that year, the ceremonies were postponed until
Monday, March 5.
   But to ensure that the nation not be without a president, Hayes
took the oath secretly on March 3 in the Red Room of the White House.
   James A. Garfield was inaugurated in 1881 and for the first time
women were front and center on the inaugural platform, moving from
the seats in the rear traditionally reserved for them. His wife,
mother and the wife of President Hayes all sat in the front row.
   When Garfield completed the presidential oath, he turned and
kissed his mother, the first mother ever to see her son inaugurated
as president.
   Beginning the first of two non-consecutive terms in 1885, Grover
Cleveland took the oath on a family Bible inscribed to S.G.
Cleveland. It had been given to him by his mother before he dropped
his given name, Stephen.
   The illustration for the Benjamin Harrison inauguration in 1889
shows Harrison taking the oath surrounded by a sea of umbrellas.
Officials had wanted to move the ceremonies in out of the rain but
the president-elect overruled them.
   The year 1889 was also the centennial of the inauguration of the
first president, George Washington. Harrison made the most of the
celebration, playing the role of Washington at several events in New
York City.
   If he cares to, George Bush can follow suit in 1989, the
bicentennial of Washington's inauguration.
   The artist who depicted William McKinley's inauguration in 1897
shows spectators viewing the scene from the roof of the newly
completed Library of Congress.
   In 1905, Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders gathered to ride in
Roosevelt's inaugural parade.
   But they ran into a problem: There weren't enough cavalry horses
for them to ride. So they used horses borrowed from the horse
artillery which were accustomed to hauling cannons, not passengers.
   The horses didn't follow orders and, the exhibit text notes,
``The Rough Riders literally lived up to their name.''
   At the ceremonies, Roosevelt wore a ring containing a lock of
Abraham Lincoln's hair loaned to him for the occasion by Secretary
of State John Hay who had served as Lincoln's White House secretary.
   By that time the era of the ``special artist'' was nearly over.
   The era of the press photographer was about to begin.
