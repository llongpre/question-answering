$220,000 SETTLEMENT A START FOR REPAIRS TO DEFECTS AT HORTON HOUSE

It wasn't quite what they were looking for, but members of the San Diego 
Interfaith Housing Foundation figure $220,000 is a good start. 
</P>
<P>
Now the foundation can start fixing the defects it claims were making life 
difficult for the residents of Horton House, a downtown housing project for the 
elderly and handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
But the amount falls far short of the millions that Interfaith was hoping to 
receive from the architects and contractors who the organization claimed did 
shoddy, substandard work on the high-rise at 333 G St. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit foundation, which owns the building, filed suit against the 
architects and builders four years ago claiming, among other things, that the 
heating system, plumbing, ventilation and closet space were inadequate for the 
needs of the elderly residents. The case finally went to trial Monday, and 
ended with a compromise settlement the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no admission of any liability whatsoever on our part," said Glen 
Rasmussen, attorney for the architecture firm of Tucker, Sadler &amp; 
Associates. "It's basically an agreement between the parties to put aside our 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
Interfaith chairman Bob Carpenter said his organization is pleased that the 
money would allow for some modifications to the building, such as upgrading the 
heating system, but added: "I can't really say we're elated." 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't enough to begin fixing all the things, but we can start," said 
Interfaith board member Crosby Milne. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Steven A. McKinley said the settlement was reached primarily because 
Interfaith's case was weakened by the testimony of a former official of the 
federal department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversaw the 
construction. "He testified that he consciously approved some of the 
construction problems that we believed were defects," McKinley said Thursday. 
The recently retired HUD official, George Bradvica, defended his testimony 
Thursday in a telephone interview from his Los Angeles home. "They wanted 
top-class material, they wanted everything gold," said Bradvica. The 
corner-cutting was necessary to keep the federal funding for the project, he 
said, "but I figured it was worth it if it would give 150 poor, elderly people 
a place to live." 
</P>
<P>
While the Interfaith board members may not agree with Bradvica's assessment, 
they are pleased that the money from the settlement will afford some work on a 
new heating system. "Those residents will be happier and warmer now, and that 
really was the prime objective," McKinley said.
