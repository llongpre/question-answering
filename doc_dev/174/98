   Texas investor T. Boone Pickens Jr. has asked the Federal Trade Commission for permission to buy a stake in Texaco Inc. 

   Mr. Pickens is the second corporate raider to take a position in the beleaguered oil company. 
New York investor Carl C. Icahn already owns a 14.8% stake. 

   Texaco learned of Mr. Pickens's intent through a letter Texaco Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane received Tuesday from Mr. Pickens's Amarillo, Texas-based company, Mesa Limited Partnership. 
The letter, signed by Mesa Vice President I.T. Corley, says that Mesa intends to purchase Texaco shares valued at more than $15 million. 

   It's unclear whether Mr. Pickens has already started to accumulate shares. 
But the request suggests that at Texaco's current share price of about $40, Mr. Pickens hasn't yet exceeded 375,000 shares, a tiny 0.15% of Texaco's 243 million shares outstanding. 

   Texaco shares closed yesterday at $40.75, up $1, on volume of more than 2.2 million, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   In the letter, Mesa says it intends to acquire its stake through purchases in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. 
Mesa also may buy or exercise options on Texaco stock. 
Mesa officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act, an investor is required to file with the commission if he intends to buy more than 15% of a company or a stake exceeding $15 million in value. 

   Texaco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last April. 
The move was to forestall enforcement of a huge $10.3 billion judgment against it in Texas in the highly publicized dispute with Pennzoil Co., over Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. Texaco and Pennzoil reached a $3 billion settlement in December. 

   Mr. Icahn accumulated his stake in Texaco in the last several months and his role as Texaco's largest holder was an important factor in talks that led to the Pennzoil settlement. 
But he opposes Texaco's plan to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings, claiming provisions in the plan are intended to entrench management and are detrimental to shareholders. 

   Market sources have said that Mr. Icahn would be willing to sell his interest in Texaco. 
It isn't clear whether Mr. Pickens would be willing to pick up Mr. Icahn's stake or join with him in an attempt to take over the oil company. 
Mr. Icahn said in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he may nominate his own slate of directors to run for the five Texaco board seats up for election at the annual meeting in May. 

   This wouldn't be the first time that Mr. Pickens and Mr. Icahn have been involved in a takeover attempt of the same oil company. 
In 1985, both Mr. Pickens and Mr. Icahn made a pass at Phillips Petroleum Corp. Neither acquired control of the company, but they benefited handsomely from a restructuring that left Phillips crippled with debt. 

   In a statement, Texaco said it hopes that Mr. Pickens "will elect to play a constructive role and not disrupt the company's efforts to emerge" from its bankruptcy-law proceedings. 
Texaco also said that there hasn't been any contact between its officials and Mr. Pickens concerning his intent to acquire Texaco shares. 

   Mr. Pickens has considered running Texaco, as he recounts it in his recent autobiography, called "Boone." 
In the late 1970s he held talks with John McKinley, then the company's chairman, about Texaco's possible acquisition of Mesa -- a transaction, Mr. Pickens recalled, that would have put him on the fast track to the top job at Texaco. 

   But Mr. Pickens declined the overture. 
"Not that I didn't want to run a major company," he said. 
"For a long time I'd wanted to do just that." 
But, he recalled telling Mr. McKinley, "being the head of Texaco isn't all that interesting unless there's more to it," such as handsomely rewarding himself and the stockholders, he recalled telling Mr. McKinley at a Texaco hunting camp in Port Arthur, Texas. 

   Mr. Pickens also referred in the book to Texaco as "the biggest bureaucracy outside the federal government."
