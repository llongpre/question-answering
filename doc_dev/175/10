  [Text] Former South Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
has told AL-DUSTUR that he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib are 
currently working on an initiative to stop the Yemeni war. In 
the meantime, sources close to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
leadership said forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
have reached the environs of the Hadhramaut Governorate, which 
is adjacent to the Shabwah Governorate. 
  YSP sources expressed doubts that the president's forces 
will 
be able to continue to advance to al-Mukalla, the capital of 
Hadhramaut, where 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who declared himself 
president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen a few days ago, is 
now present. They say these forces cannot deploy over a vast 
area and maintain their cohesion at the same time. 
  These sources believe that the opening of the eastern front 
by the forces of legitimacy in Shabwah was not meant to achieve 
military as much as political and economic gains represented in 
sharing the Shabwah oil revenues. 
  Reached by telephone in Damascus, the former Yemeni 
president 
told AL-DUSTUR that he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, the 
well-known national figure, will propose an initiative aimed at 
preserving the Yemeni unity and effecting a cease-fire. 
  'Ali Nasir declined to elaborate on this initiative at 
present as its publication may undermine the current efforts and 
contacts with the two parties to the conflict, indicating that 
he himself had earlier announced his rejection of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid's secession decision. He said: We want a solution that 
guarantees the Yemeni unity, spares blood, leads to a 
cease-fire, and solves problems within the framework of the 
state of unity. He expressed hope that the anticipated solution 
may lie in an agreement by the two warring parties to 
simultaneously announce the following: 
  1. Preserving unity and canceling the secession decision. 
  2. Ceasing fire immediately. 
  3. Lifting the siege clamped on Aden. 
  The former Yemeni president said this can be followed by 
searching for a new formula that guarantees the existence of one 
central state that is capable of survival. 
  Asked by AL-DUSTUR if these are the main points of the 
initiative he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib are proposing, he 
said the initiative contains other details. 
  'Ali Nasir Muhammad denied a statement by 'Abd-al-Qawi 
Makkawi two days ago that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid have agreed to meet in Paris. He said: We are still 
contacting the two men in order to reach a cease-fire first. We 
will arrange for a meeting between the two at a later stage. 
  In a related development, YSP sources expressed surprise at 
the delay in Kuwaiti recognition of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen and said that Kuwait was expected to be the first state to 
recognize the new state and that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh 
Sabah al-Ahmad was expected to visit Aden and announce his 
country's recognition from there. The sources attributed this 
delay to possible strong foreign pressure by international 
powers like the United States and other regional forces.
