<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the </F>
Political Bureau of the General People's Congress, by Salwa 
al-Ustuwani in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the General 
Committee (Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress 
[GPC] and head of its General Department, has announced that the 
Sanaa government and people reject any Arab military 
intervention, and called on the Arab states to stop their media 
vituperation. 
  Yemen, he said, will solve its own problems and the battles 
will settle the situation. The Yemeni official arrived in 
Damascus two days ago to meet with Yemeni leaders and figures 
and with Syrian officials to explain the explosive situation in 
his country and convey his party's views on the situation. 
  Al-'Ansi said he did not believe that the unity [of Yemen] 
was at an end because "unity is the fate and destiny of the 
Yemeni people. That is what we will fight for." He added that 
intervention by Arab forces would mean promotion of secession. 
Our unity, he said, is not a unity between two peoples to 
warrant comparison with the Syrian-Egyptian unity. Yemen has 
been united since the beginning of time. 
  He also said: "We do not want to be carried away with the 
Western and Arab media which are now claiming that there is 
civil war. That is a misconception. What is taking place in 
Yemen is not civil war. A civil war is a war between members of 
the public or between tribes, sects, or parties." 
  What is going on, he emphasized, is fighting between armed 
forces upholding constitutional legitimacy and forces rebelling 
against legitimacy "and we consider that to be military mutiny 
which must be destroyed by military means." 
  Then, speaking tactically, he said that "the civil war 
description applies to some southern governorates where there is 
a conflict in the governorates of Abyan, Shabwah, Hadramaut, 
Lahij, and Aden between the people there, between those 
supporting the unity line and the renegade secessionist forces 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]." 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Would you bet on anyone in the south? 
  [Al-'Ansi] Yes, we bet on the unionist forces within the YSP 
and we bank on them to settle the issue and to rebel against the 
leadership which we do not consider to be legitimate. In Yemen, 
the army which is fighting the renegade and secessionist forces 
is being described by news agencies and the media as the 
northern army. It is not the northern army. It is the army of 
unity and it includes people from the south and the north. The 
opposing forces, which they describe as southern, include 
elements from the north and the south. 
  The north's big wager is on the unionist forces in Aden and 
in the armed forces. Currently there are reports that Muhammad 
'Ali Ahmad and large groups loyal to former southern President 
'Ali Nasir Muhammad are beginning to respond to YSP appeals and 
take up arms inside Aden. Battles are raging in Lahij, Radfan, 
al-Dali', Mukayris, and Abyan. There is a conflict between the 
unionists and the secessionists. But there is no fighting in 
Ibb, Ta'izz, or Sanaa. There is no fighting between the people 
nor between one force and another there. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] What, in your view, is the solution? 
  [Al-'Ansi] It is to uphold the constitution, the will of the 
people, and constitutional legitimacy. What is now being said 
about Arab mediation is a thing of the past and no longer valid. 
If, in a calm atmosphere, the mediations in Amman and Salalah 
failed, what would happen against a background of military 
conflict? 
  I urge the Arab states to refrain from mediation because 
they 
only want to take positions in the media. There are more of 
such states but they know that it would be futile to intervene 
because when guns speak, reason disappears. I urge the states 
now initiating mediations to look for something else to do. We 
Yemenis are sensitive people. Above all, we say to those who 
want to exploit the current war by internationalizing the issue 
or by sending Arab forces, or anything else, we say frankly 
that, throughout history, Yemen has been the graveyard of 
invaders. That is why we reject intervention. 
  What scares us about this talk of sending forces and of 
mediation is that they are talking about Egyptian mediation and 
dispatch of forces to disengage the warring parties. That is a 
thing of the past. The Egyptians raised it two weeks ago and a 
month ago but we rejected it because the presence of forces 
would mean partition and revival of the secession. We tell 
them: Play another game, for that is out of the question as far 
as we are concerned. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] So, in your view, what is the alternative 
solution? 
  [Al-'Ansi] They should leave us alone and let us act and 
solve our own problems by military or political means. They 
would then have a clear conscience. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Do you believe that the solution lies in the 
disappearance of the current leaderships? 
  [Al-'Ansi] Why disappearance of the leaderships? The 
solution hs been spelled out in the House of Representatives. 
It used the legitimate card and dismissed 'Ali Salim al-Bid and 
Salim Salih Muhammad from their posts in the state as 
Presidential Council members. That is a part of the solution. 
  As far as the north is concerned we have invoked 
constitutional legitimacy and the people's will. 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih is there by popular demand. When the people tell 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid to go then he must go. But for him to impose a 
rule of fire and the sword on the people, exploit the crisis, 
and, against a background of mediation, sidestep the results we 
have achieved for our people, that is totally rejected. It is 
not a personal matter between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. I am not revealing a secret when I say that some 
members of the Yemeni House of Representatives have proposed two 
names for membership of the Presidential Council to replace 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad. They are (former 
southern President) 'Ali Nasir Muhammad and 'Abd-al-Qawi 
Makkawi. These are two patriotic figures with a formidable 
struggle record, respected by the Yemeni people. (It is well 
known that the Presidential Council consists of five members who 
are: 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and Salim Salih 
Muhammad). 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Do you believe that the pledge and accord 
document could still be implemented or should a new document or 
a new solution be considered? 
  [Al-'Ansi] The document is still suitable as far as we are 
concerned but the mechanism must change. Once 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
and Salim Salih Muhammad are out and are replaced in the 
Presidential Council by others, matters begin to crystallize and 
solutions to be implemented. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] So you are against the war decision? 
  [Al-'Ansi] Nobody wants war. It was "force majeure." Our 
war was limited and the military eruptions and escalations were 
on a limited scale, but when this war started three days ago our 
forces were hit in Abyan, the central security units in Aden 
were besieged and hit, and the power station in Dhummar was 
suddenly hit to disrupt the power supply to Sanaa, and the camps 
in Dhummar were hit. It was premeditated aggression. The 
Yemeni Army (northern) could not possibly remain idle. The war 
was imposed on us and we are fighting it in defense of 
legitimacy and to strike at the centers of mutiny. 
  I wish to stress that in many of the current battles, the 
main parties involved are not northern and southern forces but 
forces of mutiny and popular forces now fighting and resisting 
the rebels in the southern governorates. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] According to some reports, the northern 
forces have reached the outskirts of Aden. Do you believe it is 
possible to take control of Aden? 
  [Al-'Ansi] God willing, the situation will certainly be 
decided and control will be gained, and the brothers will lay 
down their arms. If they want destruction for their country, 
then they should continue their aggression but we ask them to 
lay down their arms and to stop the war. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] What is the purpose of besieging Aden? 
  [Al-'Ansi] To bring them down, arrest them, and refer them 
to trial because they are the ones who triggered the war. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Are the north Yemeni forces fighting fit, 
enough to settle the situation in Aden? 
  [Al-'Ansi] It is not just a question of fitness. We are 
fighting for what is right and we are the stronger in that 
respect. We are fighting for a cause. I am optimistic that 
Aden will be brought under control very soon, not because we are 
the stronger in authority and in the Army but because the people 
are against mutiny and secession. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] If Aden is brought under control, what would 
be the steps to follow? 
  [Al-'Ansi] (Defense Minister) Haytham Qasim will be referred 
to trial according to the Presidential Council's decision, 
because he is to blame for the war. Those responsible for the 
Dhummar and 'Imran massacres will also be referred to trial. 
Regarding the other brothers in the south, the people have 
dismissed them from the leadership, but 'Ali Salim al-Bid cannot 
be dismissed from the post of party secretary general. What is 
important is that the party should be a party in the full sense 
of the word, without militia, without forces, and without an 
iron fist. There should be a peaceful assumption of authority. 
That is what we and the Yemeni people want.
