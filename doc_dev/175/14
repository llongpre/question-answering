<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, Presidential Council </F>
member and assistant YSP secretary general, by Salim Badawi; 
place and date not given; from the weekly "The Event" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Muhammad] Following the eruption of battles in 
Sufyan and the 3d Brigade, the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] 
called for the formation of an inquiry commission. Regrettably, 
the incidents continued. The Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar was 
also attacked, after which the military situation exploded. We 
really regret the accusations. We also urge the stopping of 
this bleeding, this crushing war raging among the sons of the 
Yemeni people, which claims the lives of Yemen's sons. 
  [Badawi] Concerning the nature of war, Mr. Salim Salih 
Muhammad, the northern Yemenis claim that the fighting is taking 
place between the Constitutional legitimacy and the rebelling 
forces of the YSP leadership, as they put it. What is the YSP's 
viewpoint on the nature of the raging conflict? 
  [Muhammad] Are we not also part of the legitimacy? Have we 
not assumed power in light of the results of elections in the 
country? Are we not part of the Presidential Council, the 
Council of Ministers, the House of Representatives, and the 
other state institutions? We do not come from islands in the 
Pacific Ocean. We come from Yemen. We are Yemen's sons. We 
have been representatives of a state and a recognized legitimate 
power. We have achieved unity on an equal basis with our 
brothers in the north. Such claims do not render any service. 
In fact, they further exacerbate the conflict. Very 
regrettably, they also open a very deep wound in Yemeni unity 
and national unity. 
  [Badawi] The northerners' conditions for a cease-fire are 
represented by the YSP leadership's adherence to Constitutional 
legitimacy, and the submission to the legitimacy led by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, as they say. Are you willing to accept these 
conditions? What are your conditions, as the YSP, to stop 
fighting? 
  [Muhammad] The YSP has never proposed that 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih should be finished or go, or that the existing legitimacy, 
represented by the Presidential Council, the Council of 
Ministers, the Parliament, or the other existing state 
institutions, should go. However, he who has made the war 
decision, and who is waging it now against his sons, army, and 
people, to prove that he is the strongest and the triumphant, he 
is the one who will eventually lose history and the people. 
  [Badawi] What are your conditions for a cease-fire? 
  [Muhammad] We have no conditions other than actually 
beginning to implement the pledge and accord document, to 
recognize people's rights and duties, and to build the modern 
Yemeni state. Some sides believe the military option will give 
them the upper hand over everything, and enable them to 
establish their regime the way they want, in accordance with 
their own interpretations. Such a decision, I believe, is a 
crazy decision. The Yemeni Armed Forces and Yemeni 
installations are now being destroyed. Innocent people are 
being killed, the Yemeni people in Aden, Sanaa, al-Dali', Abyan, 
Shabwah, and Dhamar. These people are the victims of this crazy 
war which will not achieve the objectives of those who ignited 
the war. 
  [Badawi] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was quoted as saying 
that he wants to try 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his men, or to allow 
them to leave the country. What is your opinion about this? 
  [Muhammad] I have not heard such a thing. What I ask for 
now, from he who has reason and really wants to avoid further 
involvement in these crazy battles which, as I said, claim the 
lives of the sons of the Yemeni people, we ask them at this 
critical moments when the homeland is suffering from an ordeal 
and fragmentation, to stop the war immediately and resort to the 
language of dialogue, logic, and reason. 
  [Badawi] What about the dismissal decisions that affected 
senior southern officials, led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid? The 
northerners say that southern deputies participated in the 
voting sessions. Is that true? 
  [Muhammad] In your opinion, and in view of the current 
conditions, the state of emergency, and in view of the campaigns 
of physical liquidation we heard about in Sanaa, who would 
participate in such sessions? What kind of democratic, peaceful 
atmosphere would they have in a state of war? The world, the 
Arabs, and the Yemenis must understand what is going on in Yemen 
now. The situation is serious. It needs assistance from all 
our brothers and friends. 
  [Badawi] With regard to the rumors about appointing a 
successor to 'Ali Salim al-Bid and others in the central 
government in Sanaa, especially in the Presidential Council -- a 
probable candidate is rumored to be 'Ali Nasir Muhammad -- how 
do you view such reports? 
  [Muhammad] These issues are presented as bargaining chips in 
order to be used in haggling. In my opinion, the people have 
this right. The people gave their votes to their 
representatives in areas from which we came. These people have 
this right. 
  [Badawi] Now that the situation cannot be decided on the 
battlefield -- a week has passed since the outbreak of 
hostilities -- what are the chances that a return to dialogue 
will be effected and unity saved? 
  [Muhammad] There is no other way, regardless of the battles. 
The warring sides must eventually negotiate. I think that 
regardless of the harshness of the situation or the number of 
victims, we must preserve what is left and resort to the correct 
method, the method of dialogue, irrespective of differences. As 
for the war methods, regardless of their quick results, it will 
have very serious consequences in the future. It will not only 
cause wounds but will lead to a great suffering and moving the 
Yemeni people 30 to 40 years backward. 
  [Badawi] In your view, is it possible to save the unity? 
  [Muhammad] In my opinion, if the political will that was 
available when the unity was reached is still there, the answer 
is yes. However, judging by the methods that are being used in 
the battlefields and the vindictive way military personnel are 
dealing with unarmed civilians in towns and villages, deep 
wounds have been caused in national Yemeni unity. 
  [Badawi] Do you expect mediation, especially Arab mediation, 
to result in positive results, particularly in the foreseeable 
future? 
  [Muhammad] There is mediation and there are Arab efforts, 
but 
regrettably the brothers in Sanaa are rejecting all this. They 
believe the military solution is the ideal solution. This 
reading of the situation and of reality is tantamount to 
gambling. We wish them guidance from God. We wish they are 
guided to the right path. 
  [Badawi] In case Arab mediation fails, will you demand 
international intervention by the UN Security Council and the 
United Nations? 
  [Muhammad] So far, I have not been informed of any decisions 
from the brothers at home but we will consult on all 
possibilities, because everything is possible.
