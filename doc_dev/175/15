  [Text] Brother Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the 
Presidential Council, who arrived in Jeddah lately, met Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general to Yemen. 
  During the meeting, brother Salim Salih Muhammad was 
briefed on the results of the contacts conducted by the envoy of 
the UN secretary general, and highly praised the efforts exerted 
by Ibrahimi for implementing the Security Council's Resolution 
No. 924. 
  Brother Salim Salih Muhammad stressed the importance of 
ceasing the hostilities immediately and stopping the random 
bombardment of the civilian residential quarters and areas in 
the capital, Aden as a result of which hundreds of innocent 
citizens, including children, women and old people, have fallen 
victim, and halting the continued destruction process of public 
services by the ruling military regime in Sanaa. 
  Brother Salim Salih Muhammad highlighted the current 
suffering of the inhabitants of the city of Aden as a result of 
the siege and the random shelling, and pointed out the heroic 
steadfastness in confronting this destructive war in defense of 
honor and safeguarding the lives of the innocent. He stressed 
the need to condemn and stop this aggression by all people, 
Arab, international organizations, and other bodies to prevent 
the dangerous repercussions which increase day by day.
