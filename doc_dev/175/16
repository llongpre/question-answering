    [Editorial Report] Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic on 30 March 
publishes on page 5 an approximately 4,000-word report on the 
suspects charged in connection with a spate of recent explosions 
in Jordan. 
  AL-BILAD, ``an independent political weekly,'' claims to 
have 
accompanied Major Muhannad Hijazi, the public prosecutor of the 
State Security Court, and the defendants to the sites targeted 
for explosions. The defendants were reported to have been in 
good health. They were also reported to have said that they are 
``heroes'' because they carried out these bombings. The 
argument that they advanced is that they were carrying out God's 
injunction against ``debauchery.'' They reportedly planned to 
establish a caliphate, assassinate intelligence and army 
personnel, and kill the Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks 
teams to halt the march of ``capitulation,'' as they put it. 
  The weekly states that 'Abdallah Kamil al-Shuraydah 
al-Hashayikah is the principal defendant in the series of 
bombings that have recently taken place in Jordan. The weekly 
notes that al-Hashayikah, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
Suwaylih Branch, left Amman in 1990 to work as a teacher of 
Arabic in the Philippines, where he also taught at the al-Imam 
al-Shafi'i Foundation. This foundation is supervised by Jamal 
Khalifah, also known as Abi-Bara', a Saudi national and an 
in-law of Usamah Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national of Yemeni origin 
currently living in Khartoum, Sudan. Khalifah, Bin-Ladin's 
right hand-man, is reported to be close to the ruling Saudi 
family. 
  According to the paper, al-Hashayikah discussed with 
Khalifah 
the idea of launching of an organization in Jordan to 
``eradicate forbidden conduct by force'' in order to lay the 
groundwork for establishing a caliphate in Jordan. This idea 
was well received by Jamal Khalifah. The recruits of the 
organization would be Jordanians who received military training 
in Afghanistan during the war with the Soviets. The only thing 
the organization needed was financing. The report states that 
this all happened while the two were in the Philippines. 
Al-Hashayikah returned to Amman early this year to launch his 
organization so that he might receive the promised finances from 
Bin-Ladin, and Jamal Khalifah, ``the mastermind of Bin-Ladin's 
terrorist operations in the Arab world.'' 
  The article continues, noting that the organization 
al-Hashayikah used had already taken its final shape before he 
left for the Philippines. It had a joint command consisting of 
himself, as well as Jihad al-Tanjir, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud, 
and Isma'il al-'Amayirah. They used mosques and places of 
worship to ``concoct conspiracies.'' The recruits of the 
organization received refresher courses in military training 
during further visits to Afghanistan via Saudi Arabia or Yemen. 
  According to the paper, ``Bin-Ladin's group'' received the 
recruits in Saudi Arabia upon their arrival there, and provided 
them with the necessary visas and air tickets to Pakistan, where 
they then traveled to Afghanistan. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zandani, representative of the Yemeni Reform Grouping at the 
Yemeni Presidential Council, is reported to have provided the 
Afghan Arabs stopping over in Yemen en route to Afghanistan with 
the necessary visas and air tickets, as well as ``his constant 
financial support for the organization.'' 
  The weekly also claims that some of the organization members 
remained in Jordan to plan bomb attacks and recruit other 
members. Having faced difficulties in acquiring the necessary 
explosives in Jordan, the organization sent Zakariyah Muhammad 
Dawud Qasim to Yemen, where he was trained in how to manufacture 
sophisticated explosives. He was also trained in detonating 
explosives by remote control. 
  The paper explains that, in order to achieve its objectives, 
the organization believed that it had to kill Arab and Muslim 
leaders who do not apply the Islamic sharia in their countries. 
It also believed that it had to resist the ongoing Middle East 
peace negotiations by all means, including the use of force. 
The organization also planned to blow up movie theaters, 
nightclubs, bars, tourist areas, liquor stores, and public areas 
where the two sexes mingle, such as the Housing Bank Complex. 
The organization also planned to assassinate senior 
intelligence, army, and public security personnel in order to 
pave the way for the creation of a caliphate in Jordan. 
  Noting a plan by the organization to assassinate the 
Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks negotiators, AL-BILAD 
says: ``In addition to carrying out bombings, the organization 
members entertained the idea of drawing up a full-fledged plan 
to liquidate Jordanian and Palestinian peace negotiators, headed 
by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, former head of 
the Jordanian delegation to the peace talks.'' 
  According to the paper, the group found al-Majali's home 
telephone number, and telephoned him, telling him they were 
journalists working for a local daily. They asked for a date 
for an important press interview with him. Al-Majali agreed to 
grant them an interview. Al-Majali was meant to be assassinated 
during this bogus interview, according to the report, which it 
said was planned with a great deal of cleverness. A date was 
set for the interview and forty-eight hours before the interview 
was scheduled to take place, the organization leadership had 
drawn up a detailed plan to assassinate al-Majali by explosive 
charges and other weapons to be carried by the bogus press team, 
which would have consisted of reporters and cameramen. 
  The paper says it was only divine providence that intervened 
to save al-Majali, who was assigned an official mission outside 
Jordan. This mission required him to travel to Washington ahead 
of the time set for the implementation of the assassination 
plan. Thus, the bogus interview date was postponed to a later 
date. However, this date has never materialized because the 
culprits were apprehended. 
  The weekly paper goes on to say that, having failed in their 
bid to liquidate al-Majali, the organization members attempted 
to assassinate members of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Middle East peace talks, including Faysal al-Husayni and Hanan 
'Ashrawi. However, stringent security precautions and the 
secrecy with which al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi surround their moves 
thwarted the defendants' scheme. Undeterred by their failure, 
the defendants recruited an employee of the Grand Palace Hotel, 
where the Palestinian peace negotiators stayed. The hotel 
employee was asked to plant explosive charges in the peace 
negotiators' rooms. Once again, strict security precautions 
thwarted their scheme. 
  According to the report, the failure of the organization's 
assassination scheme prompted the organization command to 
endorse a plan of explosions in Jordan to convince Jamal 
Khalifah to finance the organization. This resulted in 
explosions at movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa'. However, 
attempts to carry out further explosions elsewhere in Jordan 
failed. 
  Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah is reportedly the ``organization's 
mastermind responsible for picking explosion targets.'' 
  The paper's investigations indicated that 'Abdallah Diyyah, 
a 
prominent Suwaylih-based Muslim Brotherhood member, was 
acquainted with the organization's scheme by 'Abdallah 
al-Hashayikah. However, Muslim Brotherhood sources ruled out 
Diyyah's involvement in this scheme. 
  Elaborating further on this issue, the paper says: ``Several 
quarters insinuated that the Muslim Brotherhood could be 
implicated in these explosion incidents, particularly since 
al-Hashayikah was a Brotherhood leader in Suwaylih, not to 
mention the fact that Diyyah was close to the hawkish wing of 
the Muslim Brotherhood. Meanwhile, informed sources ruled out 
this possibility, which has not been confirmed by the 
interrogations conducted with the defendants.'' 
  ``AL-BILAD has learned that 23 persons have been implicated 
in the recent spate of explosions. They will stand trial at the 
State Security Court within the next two weeks. If found 
guilty, they could receive punitive measures, including the 
death sentence. These defendants are the following: 'Abd Salih 
Husayn al-Jahalin, Muhammad 'Ali Husayn Shihadah Abu-'Ayyad, 
Yasin Hasan Muhammad Zahrah, Hasan Hamdan Hasan 'Abd-al-Qadir, 
Muhammad Salih Musa 'Aqil, Sulayman Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Al Bisah, 
Muhammad Ahmad 'Abd-al-Fattah al-'Adharibah, Samir Ahmad 
Muhammad Tilagh, 'Abd-al-Nasir Mahmud Muhammad Yunus, Fa'iq 
Salih Yusuf al-Shawish, 'Umar Jibril Muhammad al-Shawahin, 
'Abdallah Kamil al-Hashayikah, Jihad Ahmad Khalid al-Tanjir, 
Khalil Tawfiq Muhammad 'Alqam, Muhammad Ahmad al-Shaykh 
al-Fahmawi, Salim Musa Yusuf, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud Qasim, 
Isma'il Sa'id al-'Amayirah, Muhammad Sa'id Muqbil Dar-'Awdah, 
Walid Muhammad 'Ashsha, Muhammad Amin al-Shamasinah, Ra'd 
Khalil, and 'Abd-al-Majid al-'Adharibah.'' 
  AL-BILAD concludes its report by promising to provide its 
readers with further details as they unfold when the State 
Security Court begins to investigate this case.
