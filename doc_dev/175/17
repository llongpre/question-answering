<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah in London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT </F>
bureaus in Sanaa and Aden, and Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo: 
"Yemeni Initiative To End the Fighting Between the Two Sides"] 
  [Excerpt] The leadership of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen in al-Mukalla and Aden yesterday studied an initiative 
from the Sanaa leadership offering a cease-fire in return for a 
cancellation of the declaration of a state in southern Yemen 
without any other conditions such as the conditions previously 
laid down by Sanaa about surrender and trial of what it 
described as the "mutineers" in the leadership of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  As speculations continued all day yesterday about the likely 
reaction of the southern command, observers said that the aim of 
Sanaa's initiative was to "try to block international 
recognition of the new republic which the southerners, faced 
with President 'Ali Salih's intransigence, were forced to 
declare as a last resort to save whatever they can after the 
failure to reach understanding within the context of unity." 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Salim Salih Muhammad, 
member of the Yemeni Presidential Council in the unified state 
and of the southern Presidential council; 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, 
former south Yemeni president; Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 
deputy prime minister in the unified state; and Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah, all participated in drafting the 
initiative which was promptly accepted by President Salih. A 
high-ranking source said "we are waiting to see what develops 
from that." 
  The initiative of the Yemeni figures came as all parties 
were 
trying to contain the situation by promoting a cease-fire. Some 
sources, however, have emphasized that the southern leadership 
is now laying down two conditions before it considers any move 
on its part. The first: a cease-fire on all fronts; and the 
second: the return of all the southern units now in northern 
Yemen to the south and withdrawal of all northern units that are 
now in the south to the north. 
  It is not known if Sanaa would now accept these conditions.
