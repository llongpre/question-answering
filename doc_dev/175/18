<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Amir Taheri in London, </F>
Naji al-Harazi in Sanaa, Nura Fakhuri and Taj-al-Din 
'Abd-al-Haqq in Abu-Dhabi, and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Aden 
and Cairo: "Failure of the Meeting between Zayid and al-Ahmar 
Speeds Up United Arab Emirates' Official Recognition of 
Democratic Yemen; Salih Tries to Impose `Legitimacy' by 
Penetrating Hadramaut and Splitting the Socialist Party] 
  [Excerpts] The Yemeni war raged on yesterday while the 
search continued for a diplomatic solution that would determine 
the fate and future of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. 
Indications at both levels are that the Sanaa leadership is 
determined to impose what it sees as "legitimate and 
constitutional" by all means including opening a front in 
Hadramaut and trying to split the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
despite rejection by the southerners and the YSP leadership. 
[passage omitted] 
  Diplomatic sources in Abu-Dhabi have stated that the failure 
of the meeting held between Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar 
[Yemeni House of Representatives speaker, Yemeni Reform Grouping 
leader, and Hashid tribes chieftain], and [United Arab Emirates 
President] Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan might speed up 
the official recognition of the new southern state in Yemen 
because al-Ahmar's visit was "Sanaa's last card to clear the air 
with Abu-Dhabi, which has frankly held 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
responsible for the continuation of the fighting." 
  Diplomatic observers say that "nobody can succeed where 
al-Ahmar failed because of al-Ahmar's close personal 
relationship with Shaykh Zayid and his tribal weight in the 
region." Al-Ahmar's statement after the meeting reflected his 
extreme annoyance because 'Ali Salim al-Bid had been described 
as president. He said "that is a very big word, and it is an 
insult to Yemen." Despite his implicit criticism of the United 
Arab Emirates, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar said at his press 
conference: "I do not believe that any Arab or friendly state 
would recognize the secession." 
  Al-Ahmar emphasized that resorting to military means to 
settle the issue "was the last choice in the interest of 
safeguarding Yemen's unity." He added that "Yemen does not 
reject mediation to stop the war provided it is in the context 
of legitimacy." He denied the rumors about the possibility of a 
meeting between President Salih and the southern leader 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. He said that "it would be improper to hold a 
meeting between the president and a mutineer." 
  Al-Ahmar rejected intervention by the Security Council in 
the 
Yemeni conflict. He said: "What has the Security Council to do 
with an internal issue?" But he avoided the pitfall in which 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and development minister 
and member of the General Committee (Political Bureau) of the 
General People's Congress [GPC] -- President Salih's party -- 
slipped when he accused foreign powers of aiding the mutineering 
secessionists. Shaykh 'Abdallah did not apportion any blame in 
that respect. 
  The Yemeni House of Representatives speaker denied the 
presence of any extremist forces in Yemen. He said that Sanaa 
has given the United States assurances on that and got from it 
an assurance of support for Yemeni unity. He also denied that 
former south Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad was offered 
the post of president. He said: "'Ali Nasir Muhammad is a 
patriotic leader but we do not offer posts to anyone. The way 
is open for everyone to serve the homeland." [passage omitted]
