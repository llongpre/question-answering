<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Haydari and Faysal Makram in </F>
Sanaa and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah in Aden] 
  [Excerpts] Responsible political sources in Sanaa yesterday 
expressed their fear that Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas' visit to the United States for medical treatment is a 
political maneuver to impede the government sessions in Sanaa. 
[passage omitted] 
  Yemeni political quarters in Sanaa and Aden considered the 
sudden departure of al-'Attas, prime minister and member of the 
Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], an evasion 
from holding the Yemeni Government meetings expected to resume 
in Sanaa next Wednesday [20 April]. The cabinet held a session 
in Aden three weeks ago and in Ta'izz one week ago. 
  These quarters say that the sudden departure of al-'Attas 
for 
medical treatment in the United States arouses suspicion, 
especially since the members of his government knew nothing 
about his trip for treatment, which he began the day before 
yesterday following his meeting in Aden with U.S. Ambassador to 
Yemen Arthur Hughes. 
  Yemeni political quarters, including members of the dialogue 
committee, expressed extreme concern about what it terms as 
al-'Attas' attempt to abort the role of the Yemeni coalition 
government in implementing the accord document and to abort the 
efforts aimed at reunifying the constitutional institutions in 
Sanaa. These quarters linked al-'Attas' trip with the visit to 
Britain by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the YSP Political 
Bureau and the Presidential Council, following his Arab tour. 
The quarters considered this an evasion on the part of the YSP 
from the commitment to reunify the institutions in Sanaa, 
particularly the Presidential Council and the Cabinet. The 
Presidential Council was expected to convene in Sanaa in the 
presence of Salim Salih Muhammad following his Arab tour, during 
which he conveyed messages from YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid to a number of Arab leaders. [passage omitted]
