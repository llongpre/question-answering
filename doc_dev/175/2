<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "'Ali Nasir Rejects the New </F>
State in the South and Urges Cancellation of the Secession and 
Resumption of Dialogue"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus -- 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former south 
Yemeni president, has confirmed the statement made by 'Abdallah 
Ahmad Ghanim, the Yemeni justice minister in the Sanaa 
government, to the effect that 'Ali Salim al-Bid had telephoned 
'Ali Nasir Muhammad, who lives in Damascus, and offered him the 
post of vice president in the Democratic Republic of Yemen which 
was declared three days ago, on the basis that al-Bid would 
resign six months later and 'Ali Nasir Muhammad would become 
head of state. 
  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that he 
rejected the offer which he saw as tantamount to partition of 
Yemen which would be "a crime against unity." He added: "They 
tried to persuade me by all means in three contacts. I told 
them that I could not accept." He said that "'Ali Salim al-Bid 
offered to send today -- that is immediately -- a special plane 
to take me to him in Hadramaut. I refused and told him that I 
was prepared to return on certain conditions. The first was 
restoration of unity. And I said that I would be willing to 
work for a cease-fire and a return to dialogue and prevent the 
country's destruction. I asked him to postpone everything for 
48 hours, not to make any decisions, and revoke south Yemen's 
secession decision and return to dialogue and a cease-fire, and 
said that I would be willing to hold contacts with Sanaa and 
Aden to promote dialogue and understanding." 
  'Ali Nasir Muhammad added: "I rejected al-Bid's offer 
because I care about Yemen's unity and because I still maintain 
my principled position stated before and after these events, 
namely that I am opposed to infighting and secession. I 
emphasized in all their contacts with me and my contacts with 
them that the Yemeni solution must be within the framework of 
the unity state not outside it, that whatever the problems and 
mistakes encountered throughout the unity march, they did not 
justify secession at all, and that a distinction should be made 
between disagreement with the Yemeni president and the cause of 
Yemen's unity. Individuals disappear but unity and the people 
live on." [passage omitted] 
  Asked what he thought were the chances of survival for south 
Yemen's secession, he said "I can confirm that the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] played a significant part, along with the 
other political groups and the General People's Congress [GPC], 
in achieving unity, that the YSP derived its strength from its 
support for unity, and that abandoning unity now would mean 
suicide and would mean the end of the party." [passage omitted] 
  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad said that he did not know if 
the Gulf states or any state had any intention of recognizing 
the new south Yemeni state. He said they would have to think 
hard before taking such a step. 
  Commenting on (north) Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's 
position on what has happened, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad said: "In a 
telephone conversation I had with President Salih yesterday, he 
assured me that he would never accept the secession which is 
considered as high national treason, that there would be no 
going back on unity, that he would not accept the secession of 
the south as a fait accompli, and that he was prepared to hold a 
dialogue with the YSP or with the unionist forces within the YSP 
to rescue Yemen and its unity. I, in turn, stressed to him the 
need for a dialogue with the unionist forces in the YSP and 
asked him to keep the door open for dialogue despite the wounds." 
  The former Yemeni president also said: "I am now 
endeavoring and trying, along with some of the people who 
support unity and who are loyal to the Yemeni people, to promote 
such a dialogue between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the 
YSP. That is what I am working for in my current contacts." 
  Asked if Arab mediation has been suspended, he said: "There 
is no Arab mediation. There is Arab League mediation. Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has, in a 
telephone conversation, assured me that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has 
left the door open for dialogue with the Arab League and the 
Arab states." 
  On the reports claiming that a number of his supporters 
including the newly appointed Defense Minister 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi 
Mansur, Social Security Minister Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Batani, 
and Colonel al-Khadr al-'Aqil, were killed in a car accident, 
giving rise to widespread speculations, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
said: "That is not true. I contacted them a short while ago 
and spoke to them personally and reassured myself about their 
health. What was published about them having been killed is not 
true. They are alive and well." 
  The former Yemeni president showed annoyance at the 
appointment of Sulayman Nasir Mas'ud, formerly one of his 
supporters, as a member of the southern Presidential Council. 
He said: "I have nothing to do with that appointment or with 
him. I was not consulted. As a matter of principle I reject 
the secession and I naturally reject his appointment. It is not 
just a question of rejecting the appointment. I reject the 
whole idea. He does not represent me and I have nothing to do 
with him." [passage omitted]
