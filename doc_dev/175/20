  [Text] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni 
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, arrived in Amman yesterday at the head 
of a Yemeni delegation which includes Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah 
Muhsin, minister of housing and urban planning; Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Rahman, head of the Yemeni vice president's office; and 
a number of officials and media men to prepare for a visit by 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, who will sign the Yemeni document of pledge and 
accord in Amman on Sunday, 20 February. The document aims at 
ending the crisis in fraternal Yemen so that the brothers would 
resume their march of unity, democracy, and prosperity, God 
willing. 
  On arrival at Amman Airport, Salim Salih Muhammad made a 
press statement in which he expressed his thanks and deep 
appreciation for His Majesty King Husayn, the Jordanian 
Government, and the Jordanian people for hosting the Yemeni 
reconciliation meeting in Amman of all the Arabs. He said: We 
are pleased that Amman is the venue of this meeting which is 
awaited by the Arab nation and those who love democracy, 
especially the Yemeni people, since the document which will be 
signed in Amman is the common denominator which was agreed on by 
the Yemeni people represented by their popular and political 
parties and key figures. 
  He said that the Amman meeting will contribute to 
entrenching 
democracy, which the Yemeni community is witnessing during these 
historic moments. He noted the pan-Arab role Jordan is playing 
on all levels. 
  The delegation was received at the airport by Dr. Ma'n 
Abu-Nuwar, deputy prime minister; Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Nusur, 
minister of public works and housing; and the Yemeni ambassador 
in Amman.
