  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 23 (AFP)--Rival troops were on high alert 
east of the port city of Aden Wednesday, as the authorities in 
former North and South Yemen engaged in a war of words following 
clashes in which at least 20 were reported killed. 
  A spokesman for the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) 
accused troops from the north of having "extended their 
deployment beyond the Abyan region" about 100 kilometres (62 
miles) east of Aden. 
  Southern forces were preparing to "resist the armed 
aggression," the spokesman said, adding that northern forces, 
including the Republican Guard, had also been redeployed along 
the former north- south border, facing southern troops. 
  Meanwhile, Salim Salih Muhammad, a southern member of 
Yemen's 
presidential council, told the official UAE news agency WAM that 
Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid would "not go to Sanaa in the 
current security situation, before troops have been withdrawn 
from Yemeni towns." al-Bid was due back in Yemen later Wednesday. 
  The YSP said Tuesday the northern al-'Amaliqah brigade 
ambushed and killed 15 southern soldiers in Abyan, endangering a 
reconciliation agreement between north and south signed in Amman 
on Sunday. In Sanaa, officials of President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's General People's Congress (GPC) said two soldiers were 
killed and 20 wounded on both sides. 
  On Monday seven were reported killed in clashes between 
troops from north and south. The two armies have not been 
merged since the country was unified in May 1990. 
  Salih and al-Bid signed a deal in Amman on Sunday to end a 
political crisis which has paralysed Yemen since al-Bid refused 
to take up his duties as vice-president in Sanaa in August, 
demanding major economic, political and military reforms. 
  Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah denounced 
southern 
leaders on Wednesday for visiting neighbouring Gulf states, 
saying they were trying to gain support in the crisis. 
  "The moves by southern leaders are a continuation of the 
undeclared secessionist policies practised since last August," 
Basindwah told the Kuwaiti newspaper al-Siyasah. 
  Southerner Salim Salih Muhammad rejected Basindwah's 
comments 
as "baseless" and said the officials were touring Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to explain the Amman accord 
and patch up relations which were soured by Yemen's perceived 
support for Iraq in the 1991 Gulf war. 
  Basindwah also said Yemen was keen to have good relations 
with Gulf countries "and hopes those countries will realise the 
importance of not allowing any party to drag them over to its 
side." 
  He was commenting on al-Bid's visits to Saudi Arabia and 
Oman, just after he signed the reconciliation agreement with 
Salih. 
  al-Bid, who heads the YSP, met King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for 
the first time since the end of the Gulf war. The two leaders 
appeared on television in the region shaking hands and smiling. 
  Salim Salih Muhammad travelled to Kuwait and the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE), where he briefed leaders on the Amman accord, 
brokered by King Husayn of Jordan. 
  The reconciliation accord called for constitutional reforms, 
an improvement of security and the withdrawal of military 
checkpoints from cities.
