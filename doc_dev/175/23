<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Hamud Munsir: "General </F>
People's Congress Denies Sanaa Alliance With al-Turabi 
Conference and Brotherhood"] 
  [Excerpt] London, Sanaa -- 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi, head of 
the general department in the Yemeni General People's Congress 
[GPC], has denied reports of the arrival in Sanaa of delegations 
from Arab and international Islamic movements "to discuss an 
alliance formula with the GPC led by Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG]," the 
northern partners in the ruling coalition in Yemen, in the face 
of a so-called "Egyptian alliance with the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] against extremist organizations." 
  He made this statement following information supplied to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by well-informed sources, namely that Sanaa 
received a delegation from the West German-based Muslim 
Brotherhood's international organization based in West Germany 
and a delegation from the Khartoum-based Arab Islamic [Popular] 
Conference [AIPC] led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi. 
  The sources added that the two delegations met with 
President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and expressed willingness to support Sanaa 
in its dispute with the Aden-based YSP. 
  The sources said that the proposal for the Muslim 
Brotherhood 
international organization to cooperate with the Yemeni 
leadership "is limited to the ideological aspect" and includes 
moving the headquarters of an Islamic studies center and a 
European-based Islamic magazine to Sanaa, in addition to 
appointing Faris al-Saqqaf, member of the YRG Higher Committee, 
as the magazine's chief editor and providing expertise to 
contribute to the battle against the YSP. 
  As for the AIPC's proposal, the sources said that it 
"stresses the need to prepare for a military battle to secure a 
jihad atmosphere that helps to polarize Islamic mujahidin from 
all over the world in order to wage a war against the YSP and 
prevent it from returning to secularism." The sources added 
that AIPC representatives cited in their proposal what they 
termed "Egypt's supply of military and security experts to Aden." 
  Yemeni television's Channel 2, which transmits from Aden, 
has 
launched a media campaign against "extremism in the name of 
Islam." 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT could not get in touch with Faris 
al-Saqqaf 
yesterday evening, as he was busy with the YRG Higher Committee 
meeting. However, 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi pointed out that 
these reports "are part of the media leaks which the YSP has 
begun to use in the framework of a new shift in its media 
rhetoric to manage the Yemeni crisis." Al-'Anasi said that 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and secretary general of the 
YSP, and Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential 
Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP, "said 
recently that they had uncovered a political Islam plan in Yemen 
against the democratic unionist plan -- which is untrue and has 
nothing to do with political reality in Yemen." He expressed 
his amazement at the YSP's use of this card "to win the West 
over against political forces currently allied with it in 
power." [passage omitted]
