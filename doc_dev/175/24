<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Ali Nasir Denies Alignment With </F>
'Ali Salih and Considers His Supporters' Acceptance of Posts To 
Be a Personal Decision"] 
  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The former (south) 
Yemeni President ['Ali Nasir Muhammad] has denied any connection 
with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's recent decisions in Sanaa 
appointing a new defense minister and a new naval forces 
commander, both from the military commands which had seceded 
with 'Ali Nasir from the regime which ruled south Yemen before 
the unity, in the 13 January 1986 incidents. He said that 'Ali 
Nasir is "for national unity and Yemeni unity." 
  This came in an exclusive telephone statement to AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT from his residence in Damascus, reacting to Yemeni and 
Arab claims that the appointment of Staff Brigadier General 
'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur as defense minister after Sanaa's dismissal 
of Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, 
who belongs to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and the 
appointment of Colonel Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Hasani as naval forces 
commander, were made in the context of a new alliance between 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Nasir to strike at the YSP in the 
south by using southern elements. 
  'Ali Nasir wondered why these speculations were made now and 
why there were no speculations about coordination between him 
and the YSP when 10 men formerly loyal to him joined the party a 
few weeks ago. Ten other supporters of 'Ali Nasir, he said, are 
members of General People's Congress [GPC] leaderships. He said 
that the GPC and the YSP had "shared power, wealth, and the band 
[al-zumrah]." 
  It is worth noting that, during the 1986 incidents, the wing 
loyal to 'Ali Nasir was called the "band" and the wing including 
the current YSP leaders was known as the "clique" [al-Tughmah]. 
The sides called each other by these names. 
  The former president said that acceptance of an appointment 
to any post in the Yemeni state is a personal decision by the 
individual concerned. "When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid joined hands against us, we dissolved our own party." He 
stressed that "'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid are 
responsible for what is taking place in Yemen." 
  He stressed that a distinction should be made between the 
position he insists upon, meaning that he "only supports Yemen's 
unity and is not aligned with any other party," and the 
positions of others "who are divided between the YSP and the GPC 
as it has become a matter of personal choice" since the latter 
part of 1989 when serious preparations began for Yemen's unity. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also obtained a statement issued by 
'Ali Nasir saying that he is "deeply pained by what is going on 
in Yemen, the war and the infighting to the detriment of 
national unity and Yemeni unity, destroying the Yemeni people's 
achievements for which the people struggled for over 30 years." 
  He reaffirmed his support for the efforts made for the 
preservation of unity and the settlement of disputes and 
political conflicts through dialogue and peaceful means. He has 
done and continues to do everything in his power to settle the 
dispute between the two sides through a number of initiatives 
this year and last year. He had earlier warned and expressed 
fear that the differences and conflicts between the three 
members of the ruling coalition could develop into a fire that 
would burn the unity. 
  He added that "any efforts made or solutions proposed must 
be 
based on the preservation of Yemen's unity, not on a return to 
the borders which existed before 22 May 1990." 
  He also announced that he is "holding consultations with 
some 
Yemeni figures who have not been involved in the conflict with a 
view to a new initiative for the settlement of the Yemeni 
crisis."
