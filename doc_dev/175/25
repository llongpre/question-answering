  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 30 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni forces 
have been hampered by internal dissension and a lack of manpower 
as they struggle to thwart a northern advance along about 100 
kilometres (60 miles) of frontline around the port city of Aden. 
  Three northern tanks slipped through into the undefended 
western suburb of Madinat al-Sha'b on Saturday [25 June], the 
office of the south's appointed vice-president 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Jifri said. 
  Initially they met no resistance, giving northern forces 
enough time to consolidate their forces and cut off Aden from 
its oil refinery 18 kilometres (11 miles) to the west along the 
coast road. 
  Southern forces swiftly hurled their men towards the area in 
a bid to recapture the route to the refinery which supplies 
their troops with fuel. 
  But the north had the advantage of surprise and, turning the 
tables, launched another offensive to the north. 
  By Tuesday they had advanced as far as the city's pumping 
station about 15 kilometres (nine miles) north of the city. 
  Aden was thus effectively cut off from vital fuel and water 
supplies. 
  Southern officers collectively attribute the northern push 
to 
a lack of manpower among the soldiers loyal to southern leader 
'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  They point out that the south, which declared independence 
on 
May 21, has just three million people, compared with the north's 
population of 11 million. 
  In a bid to make up the numbers, a general call-up has been 
announced and buses tour the city collecting young men to take 
them to the front. 
  Since the war broke out on May 5 the south has been further 
handicapped by dissension among its own ranks. 
  A member of the southern presidential council, Sulayman 
Nasir 
Mas'ud, has accused soldiers loyal to the former president of 
South Yemen 'Ali Nasir Muhammad of backing the north in Abyan 
province east of Aden. 
  Muhammad, who came from Abyan, was toppled by al-Bid in a 
bloody power struggle in Aden in 1986, before the former 
conservative North Yemen merged with the Marxist South in May 
1990. 
  Al-Jifri accused units loyal to the former president 
deployed 
in the north of "treason," saying they had lent their weight to 
al- Bid's rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner. 
  The units knew the layout of the terrain in the south. 
  The south's setbacks can also be explained by the loss of 
three of their best units. They were attacked and knocked out 
of action even before the war broke out. 
  The south had tried to withdraw the units, deployed in the 
northern areas of Dhamar, 'Amran and Yarim, but the move had 
been fiercely opposed by Salih. 
  Southern leaders are also trying to combat Moslem 
fundamentalists allied to Salih. 
  About 3,000 of them are said to be hiding out in and around 
Aden, according to informed sources. 
  Southern officers have already blamed them for the fall of 
several key points, including the town of Lahij, about 30 
kilometres (18 miles) north of Aden, seized by the north three 
weeks ago. 
  Roadblocks crisscross Aden, barring the entrance to every 
district as searches go on for the Islamic militants. 
  Women militia are among 30,000 members of the Yemen 
Socialist 
Party (YSP) deployed in the city to stop any insurrection. The 
women's job is to search women wearing the Moslem veil. 
  Northern Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah has said the 
north's troops "are inside Aden itself," and Sanaa is counting 
on the population to rise up and seize the city.
