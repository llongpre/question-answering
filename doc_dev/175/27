<F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram, Iqbal 'Abdallah, Shafiq al-Asadi, </F>
and Muhammad 'Allam: "Sanaa Confirms Advance Toward Aden; 
Southerners Repel Attacks"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden, Abu Dhabi, Cairo -- The fighting 
between northern and southern forces in Yemen -- which has 
entered its third week -- expanded and became fiercer yesterday. 
Sanaa confirmed yesterday that its forces were advancing toward 
Aden to tighten the siege around it from three directions. It 
said that the forces have now moved beyond the al-'Anad base. 
While Aden said that southern forces "have dealt crushing 
blows" to northern forces, "compelling them to retreat toward 
Kirsh" (45 km northwest of Aden). [passage omitted] 
  At the security level, a high-level military official in 
Sanaa has told AL-HAYAH that government forces (northern) are 
advancing toward Aden to tighten the military siege around the 
city from three directions: north, east, and west. Government 
forces "have now moved beyond the al-'Anad base having seized it 
and extinguished the fires caused by the rockets fired on the 
base from a 20-km distance until Wednesday night/Thursday 
morning by Socialist Party sources (southern). After combing 
al-'Anad base, government forces have begun to advance toward 
al-Hawtah, capital of Lahij Governorate, where they will join 
other forces which have advanced through al-Habilayn after 
crossing the Socialist forces' fortifications in the southern 
areas of al-Dali' Directorate, which they seized about 10 days 
ago. Meanwhile other forces advanced on this axis yesterday 
toward Aden." 
  The military official added that "government forces on the 
eastern axis are engaged in fierce fighting with Socialist 
forces in the al-'Alam area between Abyan and Aden Governorates. 
They had arrived from Zanjibar (capital of Abyan Governorate) 
from al-'Amaliqah units and other government forces backing them 
on this axis." He pointed out that "a land and air attack on 
government forces in the southeastern fringes of Abyan 
Governorate was repelled when government forces shelled Aden 
airport with rockets in the early hours of yesterday morning. 
The government (northern) Air Force launched air strikes 
against naval ships belonging to the Socialist Party, providing 
a cover for the al-'Amaliqah forces' land attack toward the 
al-'Alam area." 
  On the southeastern axis, the same source confirmed that 
northern forces "are engaged in fighting with the Socialist 
Salah-al-Din Brigade some 25 km from al-'Irqah port." Socialist 
forces on this front "have suffered heavy losses in military 
equipment, and are moving toward Aden." 
  He added that "government forces have since dawn yesterday 
been engaged in fierce fighting with the 'Abbas and Taysir 
Brigade at the approaches to 'Anaq in Shabwah Governorate." He 
confirmed that the city "is about to be captured by government 
forces." 
  Meanwhile, sources close to President Salih have confirmed 
his demand that eight Socialist Party Political Bureau leaders 
be handed over as a condition for a cease-fire, or that they 
leave the country quickly. They are 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Haydar 
al-'Attas, Salih Bin-Husaynun, Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, Haytham Qasim 
Tahir, Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad, Qasim Yahya, Salih Munsir al-Sayli, 
and Muthanna 'Askar. The president excluded from this condition 
Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant secretary general of the 
Socialist Party, and 14 other Socialist Party Political Bureau 
members, most notably Jarallah 'Umar, culture minister; Anis 
Hasan Yahya, head of the Socialist Party parliamentary bloc; 
Fadl Muhsin, fish resources minister; Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah, 
housing minister; and Ahmad 'Ali al-Salami, electricity minister. 
  The sources said that President Salih briefed the Arab 
League 
secretary general's two envoys when he met with them before they 
left Sanaa for Cairo three days ago. [passage omitted]
