<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah in London, </F>
Naji al-Harazi and Hammud Munsir in Sanaa, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Sadiqi in Abu-Dhabi, Muhammad Sadiq in Washington, and 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Aden and Cairo: "Shaykh Zayid 
Holds Salih Responsible for the Continuation of the War"] 
  [Excerpt] As the fierce fighting intensifies between the 
northern and southern forces on the al-'Anad-Kirsh and 
al-Dali'-al-Rahidah fronts, it seems that the military 
operations launched by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
from Sanaa have reached red lines which cannot be crossed and 
that the situation now makes it necessary for the Arab and 
international powers to take a clear stand. Signs of such a 
stand have come from the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in holding 
President Salih responsible for the continuation of the war. A 
number of Yemeni leaderships have meanwhile considered a number 
of options including secession. 
  UAE diplomatic sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that UAE 
President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan frankly stated the 
UAE's position to the Yemeni president in a telephone 
conversation with him the day before yesterday, and said that he 
"regrets the Yemeni president's failure to respond to repeated 
appeals for a cease-fire." 
  The sources added that the UAE frankly stated its position 
because "it has no common borders with Yemen and no direct 
interest, and, therefore, being frank on the Yemeni conflict 
does not place any political or diplomatic burdens on it and 
would not leave room for anyone to doubt the UAE's goodwill and 
objectivity." 
  The sources hope that the UAE position will be an incentive 
for a number of other Arab states who are reluctant to declare 
"a frank position on the crisis to follow the example of the UAE 
as a way of putting pressure on Sanaa to agree to a cease-fire." 
They also said that although the UAE was the first Gulf state 
to sound the alarm, Shaykh Zayid "is still willing to make every 
sincere and true effort to contain the situation, prevent 
deterioration, and settle the dispute through dialogue in favor 
of the Yemeni people's interests and stability." 
  Shaykh Zayid emphasized that "dialogue is the only way to 
settle the Yemeni crisis. Yemen's interests must come before 
all other considerations." 
  Observers saw indications of the UAE position in the 
noticeable attention given to the visit of Salih Abu-Bakr 
Bin-Husaynun, the Yemeni oil and mineral resources minister who 
went there as an envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice president 
and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], 
compared with the cool official reception accorded to Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah who went there as an envoy of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that the announcement of the 
Higher Salvation Council in Aden the day before yesterday came 
after comprehensive discussions by the leaders of the YSP and 
five other Yemeni opposition parties with the participation of 
30 House of Representatives members from the southern and 
eastern governorates. The discussions covered five main points 
relating to the current options in the Yemen arena, as follows: 
  1. Appeal to the Arab kings and presidents, the United 
Nations, and the world's parliaments to intervene to stop the 
fighting, spare Yemeni blood, and prevent fragmentation of the 
Yemeni homeland. 
  2. Announce partition and restoration of south Yemen's 
independent international identity. 
  3. Ask a committee of deputies to visit some Arab and 
foreign capitals and UN centers to inform the world of the 
deputies' support for the YSP leadership. 
  4. Draw attention to the dangers of the emergence of a 
regime that supports forces which violate Arab consensus and 
forces of extremism. 
  5. Reaffirm the importance of the southern patriotic forces' 
determination to resist the northern invasion of the southern 
governorates. 
  The YSP leadership in Aden, however, has disclosed that it 
is 
currently studying a number of political options, especially 
mobilizing national support in the north and the south for the 
preservation of the unity state, and international support 
against the "alleged legitimacy which is in fact seeking to 
destroy that unity state and destroy all chances of a better 
future for the Yemeni people." 
  A responsible source at the U.S. State Department has 
confirmed that the United States "supports the efforts of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] and the Arab League to stop the 
fighting and settle the Yemeni crisis." [passage omitted]
