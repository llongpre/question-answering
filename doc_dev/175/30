  [Excerpts] Instructed by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, Local Administration Minister 
Muhammad Hasan Dammaz continued his field inspection tours of a 
number of areas and districts in the southern governorates of 
our country which have been purged from the filth of the 
apostate and secessionist gang in the leadership of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  The local administration minister yesterday visited the 
Mukayris district in Abyan Governorate. He was welcomed on his 
arrival in Mukayris by brother Staff Colonel Muhammad Isma'il 
Ahmad, the axis staff officer; Muhammad 'Abd-Rabbuh Dahnan, 
commissioner general of the Mukayris district; a number of 
district officials; officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers from the 8th Special Forces Brigade; and a large crowd 
of citizens from the Mukayris district. 
  The brother local administration minister visited the 20th 
Brigade's camp which had been purged and recovered from the 
YSP's apostate and secessionist forces by the men of our Armed 
Forces, the gallant heroes of the Special Forces Brigade, and 
with the support of citizens supporting the constitutional 
legitimacy and Yemeni unity. 
  Brother Muhammad Hasan Dammaz toured various positions in 
the 
camp and inspected its strong fortifications, which were built 
in accordance with the most up-to-date military systems. He 
also visited several weapons stockrooms in various parts of the 
camp, which contained thousands of ammunition boxes, weapons, 
batteries, artillery pieces, and antiaircraft guns. He also 
inspected large numbers of tanks, guns, and automatic machine 
guns that have been seized from the 20th Brigade after fierce 
battles waged by our Armed Forces against the forces of 
injustice and aggression, giving the most glorious examples of 
heroism and sacrifice. [passage omitted] 
  The brother local administration minister also met in the 
same camp with the officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers of the 30th Brigade, who, together with their weapons 
and equipment, joined our Armed Forces, the forces of justice 
and defense of the constitutional legitimacy and unity.
