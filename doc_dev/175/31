<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant secretary </F>
general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, YSP, by AL-DUSTUR 
correspondent Salih al-Qallab, in Aden -- date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Al-Qallab] If some delay 
takes place in implementing the accord document after it is 
signed, will the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], which controls 
the largest part of Yemen, unilaterally implement it? 
  [Muhammad] Extensive and important discussions are being 
held 
at our leadership and cadres level and with the other parties to 
reach a clear answer to the question of what to do vis-a-vis 
this document. 
  It is very difficult to answer your question. We cannot say 
now that we will unilaterally implement the document if our 
partners in the coalition refuse to implement it. However, with 
respect to issues that need no constitutional amendments, that 
do not conflict with laws in force which are adopted by the 
legitimate authorities, I say that we have the right to 
implement them in areas where it is possible to do so. [passage 
omitted] 
  We will avoid everything that violates the Constitution, 
harms unity and could be interpreted as being part of the 
establishment of a second state. We will continue dialogue with 
all the parties concerned to achieve what one can call a white 
revolution. 
  [Al-Qallab] It is obvious that the YSP is inclined to sign 
this document outside Yemen while others believe the signing 
should take place on Yemeni soil. Why are you prefer to sign it 
abroad? 
  [Muhammad] We, in the YSP, prefer that the document be 
signed 
in Jordan for three reasons: 
  The first is that the brothers in Jordan had suggested at 
the 
start of the crisis that a meeting between the president and his 
vice president take place in Amman. Brothers 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Salim al-Bid agreed to this. [passage omitted] 
  The second reason is that, this time, we want witnesses. We 
want an Arab presence, other than the Jordanian brothers. We 
proposed that the anticipated Amman meeting be attended by 
neighboring countries. There is a direct connection, for 
example, between the issue and the brothers in Oman, in Saudi 
Arabia, and in Eritrea, not to mention Egypt, Syria, the PLO, 
and the Arab League. 
  We want these fraternal countries to be represented at a 
high 
level. Also, there are some foreign countries which from the 
beginning have shown an interest in the need to seek a solution 
for the Yemeni crisis and to safeguard Yemeni unity. These 
countries should be invited to the Amman meeting, particularly 
France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
  The third reason is that I believe that the Yemeni crisis is 
still acute, particularly concerning its military and security 
dimension. While we take the first steps, during the signing 
ceremony, we do not want to see any security breaches that might 
inflame the situation and destroy all the achievements that have 
been attained. 
  In other words, if the signing ceremony takes place in a 
Yemeni area or city, every party or group attending the meeting 
will be escorted by huge security forces. In such a case, it is 
not far-fetched that, intentionally or not, a misunderstanding 
could take place between this or that person. This would lead 
to a catstrophe because the situation and atmophere are very 
tense. Huge efforts, including those of the Jordanian brothers, 
have been made to prevent this. 
  We believe that the signing of the document in fraternal 
Jordan will guarantee the safety of all, including the brothers 
and friends who will be invited to attend. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Qallab] We have noticed that all the YSP leaders, 
including the vice president and the prime minister have moved 
from Sanaa to Aden. Is this some kind of a strong protest 
against a specific situation, for security reasons, or to avoid 
an eruption of the situation, particularly at this stage? 
  [Muhammad] There are two reasons: Security in Sanaa, 
regrettably, is not available, particularly for the leaders and 
members of our party. This is substantiated by the fact that 
many of our houses have been attacked, and we have lost several 
of our leaders and cadres in broad daylight. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Qallab] When will you return to Sanaa? 
  [Muhammad] We decided to have our brothers in the House of 
Representatives return and assume their duties. But, with 
respect to some leaders, the causes which forced them to leave 
Sanaa should first be remedied. 
  [Al-Qallab] We have heard that 'Ali Nasir Muhammad might 
return to Aden. Have matters been definitively settled with 
that wing of the YSP? 
  [Muhamma] Yes. This issue has been closed for more than two 
years now. With respect to brother 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, we have 
no objection to his return to Aden. We welcome him. 
  We have settled all differences and have closed the January 
incidents file on the basis of dialogue and alliance, and the 
formation of a broad front of all the forces, parties, and 
figures to complete the unity project.
