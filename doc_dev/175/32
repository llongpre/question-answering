  [Excerpts] Political parties participating in the Yemeni 
coalition government, and Yemeni party figures signed the pledge 
and accord document in Amman on 20 February under the 
sponsorship of his Majesty King Husayn. 
  Hundreds of Yemeni and Arab political figures came to Amman 
to participate in the signing ceremony and to witness it. 
  AL-AHALI covered the event and interviewed Salim Salih 
Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and 
assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socilaist Party [YSP]. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the series of assassinations of YSP officials, Salim 
Salih 
Muhammad said the party that carried out the assassinations is 
the Jihad organization, an organization sponsored by the Yemeni 
Reform Grouping. Some of these elements returned from 
Afghanistan and were identified. They were identified only in 
the areas where we are present, he said. We supplied all the 
information needed concerning their activities and they were 
arrested. Others are still at large in Sanaa and the tribal 
areas. Some tribes and shaykhs are protecting them, not to 
mention some influential armed forces officers. 
  Muhammad added: That's why the first point of the document 
dealt with addressing the security situation, and arresting the 
culprits and bringing them to trial. He said: We do not pass 
judgment in advance. We leave this to the courts to decide. 
  Muhammad added that the security issue is now the major 
concern of the people. One week ago, oil companies and embassies 
gave us information on terrorist operations to take place in the 
southern areas, particularly attacks against oil facilities. 
  Salim Salih Muhammad admitted that some documents show that 
this scheme and those responsible for it are connected to Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national who is now in Sudan. Usamah 
Bin-Ladin is known for his support for fundamentalist movements, 
particularly those returning from Afghanistan. 
  Muhammad added: I told the U.S. ambassador that you nurtured 
these terrorists and used them at a certain time to confront the 
liberation movements, nationalist regimes, and the socialist 
bloc. Now they have turned against you. 
  Muhammad said: Our stand in the YSP on terrorism is firm. We 
are against it, against exporting it, and against all the forms 
it may take, whether ideological or any other form. [passage
