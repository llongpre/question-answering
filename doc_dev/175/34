<F P=106> [Report by 'Afaf Zayn] </F>
  [Excerpts] London -- As 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, 
assistant secretary general of the General People's Congress and 
Presidential Council member, was telling journalists in Sanaa 9 
May that fighting had stopped at all axes in the Abyan 
Governorate in the south of the country and that the military 
situation had been decided in favor of pro-government forces 
"poised to complete their tasks by entering Aden within 48 
hours", 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] was telling AL-WASAT on the line from his 
Aden residence that "they will enter Aden over our dead bodies." 
He was emphatic that the Army brigades in what used to be known 
as Southern Yemen before the merger "would soon shift from their 
defensive to an offensive posture," after the intensive bombing 
had failed to achieve its objectives. 
  Contradicting 'Abd-al-Ghani's contention that the fighting 
"was about to be settled in favor of the legal forces against 
the separatists in the YSP, al-Bid told AL-WASAT "the military 
situation" had not been decided in favor of the forces under the 
man (President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih) who made the insane 
decision to set off the explosion. Arab and world opinion can 
now better judge the kind of practices we have endured over the 
three and one-half years that the merger lasted. He drew a 
parallel between "the military option President Salih had been 
planning before the signing of the accord document in Amman and 
the illegal appointments and dismissals and Saddam Husayn's 
decisions following the invasion of Kwuait and his dismissal and 
replacement of the Kuwaiti government." [passage omitted] 
  With escalating hostilities, the political situation in 
Sanaa 
and Aden continues to be ambiguous. According to Salim Salih 
Muhammad, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih opted for the military 
option once he realized that under a regime of political 
pluralism following 14 years of totalitarian rule, he had lost 
many of his privileges. Driven by a tribal mentality, he put the 
fate of the country on the line, equating himself with the state 
and the army. It is this kind of mentality that destroyed the 
union. His lending his ear to certain YSP officials, who were 
closer to his way of thinking since the proclamation of unity, 
propels the "conspiracy theory". That conclusion is echoed by 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, who says: "Yes, there is a conspiracy." 
  What does this conspiracy seek to achieve? Al-Bid replies 
that the aim is to set up in the region a theocratic entity 
built on the alliance between the military and the fundamenalist 
establishments. "It is the military fundamentalist state of 
Sudan, along the lines of which other such regimes are being 
planned," asserts al-Bid. [passage omitted]
