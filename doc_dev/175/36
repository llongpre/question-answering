  King Husayn once again welcomed the brother members of the 
Yemeni leadership, in his name and on behalf of the Jordanian

achievement of the accord document, which will be a good

  For their part, the brother chairman and vice chairman of

al-Iryani, minister of planning and development; Jarallah 'Umar, 
minister of culture; and Sinan Abu-Luhum, member of the dialogue

  For the Jordanian side, the meeting was attended by His
