<F P=106> [Report by Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq: Salim Salih: Some Yemeni </F>
Forces Support Military Option; Experience Taught Us Signing 
Does Not Mean Anything"] 
  [Text] Abu Dhabi -- Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant 
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and member 
of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has cast doubt on the 
possibilities of implementing the Yemeni Pledge and Accord 
Document signed in Amman last Sunday. And he warned of the 
threat of civil war. 
  The Yemeni official said at a press conference in Abu Dhabi 
following his meeting with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, 
president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE], that "the document 
will not see the light of day in practice except in the areas 
which fall under YSP influence." He also said that Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid will not go to Sanaa except after 
the implementation of the document begins. 
  The Yemeni Presidential Council member -- who visited the 
UAE 
in the framework of a tour designed to explain the horizons of 
the Yemeni crisis after the signing of the Pledge and Accord 
Document -- added that "there are those who are helping to 
bolster military action and military option tendencies and to 
turn the tables on all parties." He praised Shaykh Zayid 
Bin-Sultan's understanding of conditions in Yemen. He said that 
"without securing a new mechanism to implement this document, it 
will remain in the drawer." He broached the experiment of the 
past four years, saying that "it has caused us to believe that 
signing is not the important step, but, rather, implementation 
and starting implementation." 
  He described the incidents which have occurred over the past 
two days in Abyan Governorate as "designed to torpedo the Yemeni 
people's prospects after the signing of the document." He said 
that "the document is not a medical prescription to remedy the 
Yemeni crisis. The crisis needs mutual and united efforts from 
all political parties and from all sincere people who want to 
spare Yemen a civil war and the road of violence, terrorism, and 
fragmentation." 
  Salim Salih Muhammad stressed that "'Ali Salim al-Bid, YSP 
secretary general and vice president, will not go to Sanaa under 
the present security situation unless this situation is resolved 
and armed troops are withdrawn from the cities and unless 
credibility regarding what has been agreed upon is proved." 
  Asked whether that means that the document is merely ink on 
paper, the Yemeni official said: "It will be so if it remains 
in the drawer, if the situation remains as it stands, and if the 
Armed Forces and security forces continue to detonate the 
situation here and there." 
  He stressed that the document "will not see the light of day 
in practice except in the areas which fall under YSP influence." 
  Asked about the benefit of signing the document when the 
disputes are still there, Salim Salih said that "the signing is 
binding on all parties, and it exposes any parties that refuse 
to implement the document. At then the people will know who 
does not want to implement it." 
  He added: "It is clear that there are those who are helping 
to bolster the military action and military option tendencies. 
They want to turn the table on all the parties. This is what 
we want the brothers, friends, and the Yemeni people to be aware 
of." 
  Salim Salih Muhammad accused "some military commanders and 
other forces of supporting this tendency." He said that "the 
testimonies of those arrested pointed to the existence of these 
forces, which help, support, and sometimes embrace elements 
which have returned from Afghanistan and elements accused of 
carrying out bombing operations and assassinations and recently 
abducting three Chinese engineers." 
  On the nature of the disagreements which emerged in Amman 
after the signing of the document and prevented the return of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
to Sanaa, accompanied by King Husayn of Jordan, Salim Salih 
Muhammad pointed out that "what was agreed upon in Amman is only 
what is mentioned in the published document. However, there 
were some issues which needed to be discussed. But regrettably, 
the brothers in some parties, including the General People's 
Congress and the Reform Grouping, did not give us the 
opportunity to do so." He added that the YSP submitted a 
working paper about what should be done after the signing, "but 
they refused even to read it." 
  Salim Salih Muhammad urged all parties on the Yemeni scene 
to 
take account of current changes and to work together to spare 
the Yemeni people the threat of civil war and fragmentation, 
secure whatever guarantees stability and development, and 
implement the various political, economic, and social plans. 
  He stressed that the YSP leadership is working to bolster 
Yemeni unity; it is not seeking separation. However, he warned 
that "unless matters are resolved fairly and rights are returned 
to their claimants, and unless local government is implemented, 
powers allocated, and a clear relationship between Sanaa and the 
other governorates and regions secured, we will find ourselves 
in a different position. What we fear is for Yemen to turn into 
more than one part, not just north and south, as was the 
situation in the past. Because changes have imposed on us new 
realities in relations and in understanding people." 
  On his visit to Kuwait -- the first by a Yemeni official 
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 -- Salim 
Salih described this visit as "a good start in the framework of 
establishing normal relations between the two countries." He 
also said that "for our part, we presented our view to normalize 
relations between the two countries." 
  He expressed his hope that Kuwait will transcend the deep 
wound with regard to Yemen's official positions during the Gulf 
war. he said, "we as brothers should transcend the past and 
look to the future." 
  He stressed that current conditions in the region, including 
the efforts to secure a solution to the Palestinian issue and 
the Arab-Israeli conflict, require the achievement of a degree 
of Arab solidarity. He expected Kuwait to embark in the period 
ahead on steps toward normalizing its relations with a number of 
states. He described the results of 'Ali Salim al-Bid's visits 
to Egypt and Syria as good, saying they have achieved their 
results at all levels.
