  [Excerpt] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- The impact of the ongoing 
battles between North and South Yemen has reached the Yemeni 
Embassy in Cairo. Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah issued a decree relieving Yemen's Ambassador in Cairo 
'Abd-al-Jalil Ghilan, a southerner, of his post and recalling 
him to Sanaa, appointing Ambassador 'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id, a 
northerner, in his place. 
  Ghilan closed the embassy's electronic doors this morning, 
prevented staff from entering to assume their duties, and took 
refuge in his residence on the upper floor of the embassy 
building. The employees assembled in front of the building, 
causing a traffic jam on Amin al-Rafi'i Street in the al-Misahah 
area of al-Dukki. A police force imposed tight security around 
the embassy. 
  A security source has stated that the goal of these security 
measures is to protect the embassy against storming operations 
or riots. 
  Muhammad Fayid, a diplomatic attache at the embassy, told 
MENA that work was supposed to be resumed in the embassy this 
morning according to official instructions, which granted 
employees a four-day holiday for 'Id al-Adha. But he was 
surprised to find the embassy closed. 
  Fayid said he learned that former Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil 
Ghilan, who, as he put it, was recalled by President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, grabbed the embassy keys from the inside guard 
and threw him out. Hence, he added, the embassy staff and 
diplomats were unable to enter to perform their duties and 
render services to the members of the Yemeni community in Egypt 
or to the Egyptians. 
  Fayid commended the Egyptian efforts to resolve the Yemeni 
crisis and President Mubarak's appeal for a cease-fire. He said 
that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih responded to that 
appeal and accepted a cease-fire. But the southern leaders' 
decision to break away led the situation to explode, he said. 
He denied a separation of North and South Yemen, describing 
events as "a mutiny" by a group of renegades and affirming that 
the entire Yemeni people support unity. [passage omitted]
