  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Southern officials mounted a 
diplomatic drive on Tuesday in the Gulf, after troop clashes at 
home which claimed at least eight lives despite a reconciliation 
accord between Yemen's rival leaders. 
  Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, met King 
Fahd 
in the Saudi capital, while his deputy Salim Salih Muhammad met 
the Kuwaiti amir, Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, and called for ties 
to be restored. 
  They were the first such high-level visits since the 1991 
Gulf war, when the conservative monarchies accused Yemen of 
siding with Iraq and Kuwait broke off relations. 
  Al-Bid later travelled to Oman while Salih Muhammad went to 
the United Arab Emirates, where he said the tour was aimed at 
drumming up support for Yemen after the reconciliation signed on 
Sunday in Amman by al-Bid and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a 
northerner. 
  Referring to the clashes which have erupted since the deal, 
the envoy called on "all parties concerned to help remedy the 
situation and allow the return of stability." 
  But an Arab diplomat here, declining to be named, warned 
that 
the al-Bid initiative could back-fire and "aggravate the crisis 
of confidence between the president and his deputy." 
  Al-Bid is still refusing to return to Sanaa from his 
southern 
base of Aden, where he has taken refuge since last August, an 
official in the president's General People's Congress (GPC) said. 
  He said the vice president was demanding the arrest and 
trial 
of those responsible for the series of political assassinations 
since the country united in May 1990, most of which have 
targeted al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP). 
  Since Friday, fighting between rival Yemeni troops has 
killed 
at least eight soldiers and created an "explosive" situation 
which could run out of control, diplomatic and defence ministry 
sources said. 
  Seven died in two separate clashes in the south on Monday, 
the day after the Amman accord calling for major economic, 
political and military reforms. Another soldier was killed in 
fighting near Aden airport on Friday. 
  The accord on decentralization, as demanded by the south, 
was 
aimed at ending a political crisis between Salih and al-Bid that 
threatened the unity of the country. 
  Despite unity, the two armies have not merged -- although 
northern units have been sent south and vice versa -- and 
tension has grown with troop build-ups along the former frontier. 
  The situation has become "explosive," with a risk of the 
fighting spreading across the country, a source close to Defence 
Minister Haytham Tahir Qasim, a southerner, said after the 
latest clashes. 
  Four soldiers were killed and 20 wounded in the town of 
Lawdar, 100 kilometres (60 miles) northeast of Aden on Monday, 
diplomatic sources said. 
  Southern troops dispatched as reinforcements from the port 
of 
al-Mukallah fought for several hours with a northern brigade in 
a battle involving tanks and artillery. 
  Three other soldiers died Monday when northern forces 
attacked an administrative building held by southern troops in 
Zinjibar, 30 kilometres (20 miles) east of Aden, and the capital 
of Abyan province, the sources said. 
  Tension flared in Abyan after the president overturned the 
nomination of a local governor by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al- 'Attas, a southerner. 
  A military commission was dispatched to Abyan to sort out 
the 
dispute between the rival forces but so far the mission has been 
a failure, the YSP said. 
  But the GPC official played down reports of tension, saying 
the situation in Abyan was calm after the commission's 
intervention with the backing of the US and French embassies. 
  "The alarming reports from the YSP are designed to 
camouflage 
the actions they are taking that are contrary to the 
reconciliation accord," he charged.
