deputies from the south, religious leaders and representatives 
of political parties and political leaders. 
  The five include the leader of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
(YSP) 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who spearheaded the break with Sanaa. 
  Members were named as: 

  -  al-Bid 
  -  Salim Salih Muhammad -- YSP deputy secretary-general 
  -  'Abd-al-Rahman Ja'far -- secretary-general of the opposition 
"Sons of Yemen Party" 
  -  'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi -- Opposition figure resident in Cairo 
  -  Sulayman Nasir Mas'ud -- a supporter of former South Yemen 
president 'Ali Nasir Muhammad. 


    Al-Bid proclaimed overnight Friday an independent Yemen 
Democratic Republic in what was formerly Marxist South Yemen 
amid a two-week civil war with forces loyal to President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, a northerner. 
  The break came four years to the day after South and North 
Yemen were reunified.
