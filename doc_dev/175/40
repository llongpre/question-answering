<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Lutfi Shatarah, Hammud </F>
Munsir, and Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Southern Forces Prepare To 
Launch Revenge Attack After 100 People Are Killed in 'Imran 
Fighting"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, Damascus -- Military 
confrontations between northern and southern forces in Yemen 
entered a serious stage yesterday after more than 100 people 
were killed from the two sides, among them 20 civilians, and 200 
wounded, and after forces moved from northern and southern camps 
and set up posts in the areas adjacent to their camps. A state 
of maximum alert has been announced among southern forces in 
Aden, including the air force, in what has been described as 
preparation for launching a revenge attack within 24 hours. 
  The security situation has become more serious following the 
attempt in Sanaa to assassinate Dr. Hasan Makki, first deputy 
prime minister and member of the General People Congress [GPC] 
General Secretariat (political bureau). [passage omitted] 
  At the military level, Yemeni sources said that the 
continuing tank battles between northern and southern forces in 
'Imran, north of the capital, Sanaa, presage an expansion of the 
fighting to all Yemeni governorates, especially as military 
reports confirmed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the forces 
present in all northern and southern camps in the former fringes 
area have moved from their barracks and set up posts in the 
areas adjacent to their camps. 
  Authoritative sources in Aden have said that all camps in 
the 
city, including the air force, are on maximum alert. 
  The sources expect southern forces to launch a revenge 
attack 
within the coming 24 hours on northern forces in some southern 
governorates. The sources accused Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih of "wanting to eliminate the southern brigades 
stationed in the north. So it is difficult to return the 
northern forces based in the south peacefully." [passage 
omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday former South 
Yemen President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad urged the political 
leadership and conflicting Yemeni parties to take steps to 
quickly contain the crisis and stop the explosion which could 
lead to disastrous consequences. He said: The political 
leadership must stop evading the crushing crisis Yemen is 
experiencing. 
  He also said: The fighting that broke out among comrades in 
arms is unjustifiable, because there can be no victors in this 
fighting. 
  President 'Ali Nasir appealed to the Armed Forces "not to 
aim 
their weapons against one another, in order to spare blood and 
keep the Armed Forces strong and coherent so they can protect 
and safeguard the homeland." He urged all parties to adhere to 
the Pledge and Accord Document. 
  Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad stressed that the 
solution to this crisis should be Yemeni and that others' task 
should be to help only. President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad revealed 
an initiative he submitted recently to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, saying that this 
initiative can form a prelude to a dialogue and breakthrough in 
the Yemeni situation. 
  The former president praised Arab efforts, especially those 
being made by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and some other 
Arab brothers. He said: Everyone in Yemen is responsible for 
this conflict; no one can be cleared. And they must rescue 
Yemen and the Yemeni people.
