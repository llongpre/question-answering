  [Text] [Announcer] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the 
Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], accompanied by Dr. 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Political Bureau and 
secretary of foreign relations, arrived in Amman today on a 
two-day visit to Jordan during which they will meet with His 
Majesty King Husayn and senior officials. The visit comes 
within the framework of their tour of the region. 
  Upon arrival at Amman Civil Airport, Salim Salih Muhammad, 
member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, spoke to reporters 
about his visit Jordan. He said: 
  [Muhammad] First, we carry the greetings of the Yemeni 
people and of their political leadership and parties to His 
Majesty King Husayn and the fraternal Jordanian people. We also 
carry our great appreciation for the efforts exerted by our 
Jordanian brothers and by His Majesty King Husayn, including 
both the efforts that preceded the signing of the accord 
document and the efforts that followed, represented by the great 
role played by fraternal Jordan within the military committee, 
as well as its political efforts aimed at solving the existing 
political crisis. 
  Our current tour comes within the framework of efforts 
to inform our brothers in Jordan and the Arab brothers of the 
nature of the present situation. It also comes within the 
framework of a request for help, especially from fraternal 
Jordan, to overcome problems and certain difficulties we are 
facing. We specifically ask fraternal Jordan to continue this 
role because, in our view, it is a role that does not concern 
the Yemenis alone, but concerns all Arabs. It is an honorable 
pan-Arab role. 
  We reiterate our thanks to fraternal Jordan, to His 
Majesty King Husayn, and to the Jordanian Government. 
  [Announcer] On Yemeni efforts to implement the Yemeni accord 
document, Salim Salih Muhammad said: 
  [Muhammad] The dialogue is still going on. What is 
important to us now is to obstruct the military course -- a 
course that is frightening to us -- and to reinforce the other 
course -- the course of dialogue -- in order to begin 
implementing this document that sets the practical and sound 
solutions to correct the Yemeni situation. Moreover, it is now 
important to us to build the new Yemen, which secures rights and 
duties for all its people. 
  [Announcer] On the presence of other Arab mediation efforts. 
He said: 
  [Muhammad] We do not view mediation efforts as separate 
efforts but as concentrated Arab efforts. Therefore, we welcome 
all our Arab brothers' support for the ongoing efforts inside 
Yemen. At the same time, we particularly welcome the Arab 
efforts represented by the roles played by the two fraternal 
countries, Jordan and Oman. 
  [Announcer] On the practical steps that should be taken in 
order to overcome the crisis in Yemen, Salim Salih Muhammad said: 
  [Muhammad] At the Amman meeting held in this good land 
during the holy month of Ramadan, certain issues were defined in 
terms of beginning to implement the provisions of the accord 
document, starting with the security issue, which worries the 
Yemenis and really needs immediate implementation in order to 
bring things back to normal in Yemen. Afterward, we will get 
into the priorities according to a fixed timetable. This is the 
normal course in order to get the crisis and Yemen out of the 
dark tunnel.
