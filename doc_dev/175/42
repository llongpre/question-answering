<F P=106> [Fax interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant </F>
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and member 
of the Aden Presidential Council, in London; by an unidentified 
AL-SHIRA' correspondent in Beirut; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-SHIRA'] Was your presence and that of other 
south Yemeni leaders abroad when the war broke out a coincidence 
or was it planned? 
  [Muhammad] I was on a mission to brief Arab presidents and 
kings on the other side's preparations for war and to appeal to 
them to intervene to prevent it. The other party, however, went 
ahead with its preparations and the war broke out while I was 
receiving medical treatment in London. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] What were your expectations before going abroad? 
How do you view the military situation now? What areas are 
under 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's control and what areas remain in 
your hands? 
  [Muhammad] When Yemeni unity was peacefully and 
democratically attained, certain influential circles in Sanaa 
were not happy with the way it was brought about. So they 
created difficulties and challenges from the first day, 
including assassinations, the abolishing of the new state's 
institutions, involvement in the Gulf war, undermining the 
economy, and finally making the decision to begin the current 
war. There is now fighting in Ta'izz, Lahij, Abyan, Shabwah, 
and Ma'rib. The two capital cities are subjected to missile 
attacks and air raids. The northerners are losing thousands of 
troops and hundreds of tanks and other vehicles for every small 
advance they make into al-'Anad Base or Abyan. No matter how 
many areas 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih controls, the logic of force and 
its consequences are unacceptable. The outcome of occupation 
and invasion will be overturned sooner or later. An examination 
of Yemeni history will illustrate this point. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Are you preparing yourselves for a war of 
attrition? Where are you getting the weapons? 
  [Muhammad] We did not begin the war. We do not want war at 
all. The area that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is now invading fought 
off the British Empire, the Turks, and the Portuguese. It has 
been a graveyard for invaders. There is strong resistance 
despite the ferocity of the battles. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Are you afraid Aden will turn into another 
Sarajevo? 
  [Muhammad] Although our army is much smaller and our areas 
are less populous than the north, the heroic steadfastness of 
our warriors has upset their numerical superiority. Aden's 
quicksand and mighty waves will drown the forces they are 
massing to attack the city. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Why has the oil not been attacked yet? 
  [Muhammad] We respect the investments and interests of 
others. We have the capability to hit Ma'rib and al-Hudaydah but 
we wish to protect the Yemeni people's interests and other 
people's interests. The other side, however, has struck at these 
interests by hitting Aden's refineries and is trying to approach 
and control the oil installations in Shabwah. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Was there no alternative to your separation? 
  [Muhammad] What other response do you expect from people who 
find war, destruction, and death imposed on them? What other 
option is there? 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Don't you think that giving up power for the 
sake 
of unity is a worthwhile sacrifice? 
  [Muhammad] We were idealists and gave up power for the sake 
of unity. We accepted a two-way and even a three-way 
partnership and believed that this idealism would find a 
favorable response. The bitter facts proved that the other side 
wished to dominate us, abolish our rights, and monopolize 
everything. We discovered that the unity we had dreamed of was 
not realized in substance or form. We will leave this to 
political analysts to judge later and decide which side wanted 
unity and which side is actually separatist. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Have you been using the tactic of luring the 
northerners to the south to prolong the war and sap their 
capabilities for a political purpose? Are you trying to get 
Arab-international intervention that will formalize the current 
status? 
  [Muhammad] The next few days will answer this question. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] What is the actual U.S. position on the issue? 
Is it true that coordination between you and the United States 
began when [Yemeni Socialist Party Secretary General] 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid visited the United States and met with U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore? 
  [Muhammad] We hope that the U.S. attitude will be consistent 
with the U.S. position on the new world order and its views on 
democracy, human rights, renunciation of violence and terrorism, 
rejection of military dictatorship, and respect for all nations' 
mutual economic interests on an equal basis. The Sanaa party 
does not respect these principles, judging by its atrocious 
conduct before and during the war. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] How do you assess the roles played by the Arab 
countries? 
  [Muhammad] There is no effective Arab role. It has been 
paralyzed since the Gulf war. The Egyptian, Saudi, Syrian, and 
Emirian appeals to end the fighting are welcome but what we 
actually need is a firm Arab position to end the war and make 
the two parties accept dialogue to reach solutions satisfactory 
to both sides. As to the Iraqi position on the issue, the 
statement issued by the National Command [of the Iraqi Arab 
Ba'th Socialist Party] and the attitudes shown by their 
representatives at the Arab League demonstrates Iraq's position. 
Iraqi officials are also making visits and sending Republican 
Guard experts and experts in other fields to the north. We used 
to believe that Iraq was concerned with improving its poor 
economic conditions instead of meddling in other people's 
affairs but it appears that the militarist mentality that ruined 
many of our Arab countries is now shared by the Iraqi regime and 
the Sanaa regime. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] When will the Arabs and the world recognize you? 
Why has this recognition been delayed? 
  [Muhammad] Arab and international circles acknowledge that 
there are two Yemens. Recognition that we are two equal parties 
exists. How else would you explain the referral of this issue 
to the Arab League and the UN Security Council? The 
representatives of south Yemen were accorded the same level of 
reception as the representatives of the north.
