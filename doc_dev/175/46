  [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received the credentials 
of Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, Yemen's new delegate to the 
Arab League, succeeding Ambassador Ahmad al-Shajni, who died 
recently. 
  Ambassador Luqman stated that he and the Arab League 
secretary general discussed several issues concerning ways to 
resolve the Yemeni crisis and said that the Arab League has 
resumed its mediation efforts to resolve the crisis. He noted 
that efforts are being made quietly to resolve the crisis within 
the context of the Yemeni Constitution. He said: In Sanaa we 
look at the situation from the viewpoint that a state exists and 
there are legitimate constitutional institutions chosen by the 
entire Yemeni people. Hence no party has the right to declare 
secession. 
  He described the current war in Yemen as one between the 
legitimate government and separatist rebel forces. 
  Asked about Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
readiness 
for dialogue with the Aden leaders, Luqman said Sanaa has never 
stopped the dialogue, which continued throughout 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid's stay in Aden. He called for resorting to legitimacy 
and constitutional institutions. 
  Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, Yemen's new permanent 
delegate to the Arab League, was born in al-Hudaydah in 1948 and 
began his political career as deputy minister of social affairs 
from 1976-1980. He then became minister of state and secretary 
general of the Higher Council of Youths and Sports from 
1981-1983, minister of municipalities and housing from 
1983-1988, and minister of insurance and social affairs from 
1990-1993.
