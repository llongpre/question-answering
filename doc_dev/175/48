<F P=106> [Telephone interview with former South Yemeni President 'Ali </F>
Nasir Muhammad, by Hasan Sabra; place and date not--first three 
paragraphs are AL-SHIRA' introduction] 
  [Text] Former [South] Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
warns of the perils of the ongoing war in Yemen, asserting that 
the "Yemeni states" that the ongoing war threatens to create 
pose a threat to the entire region. 
  In a telephone interview with AL-SHIRA', the former Yemeni 
president asserted that the crisis will be resolved through 
dialogue only and noted that the "entire Gulf is for Yemen's 
unity and for a peaceful solution to the problem." 
  Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad pointed out that there 
are taboos in the ongoing war, saying that "whoever approaches 
the oil fields commits suicide" and that "it is difficult to 
establish a fundamentalist regime in Yemen." Following is the 
text of the interview: 
  [Sabra] What is your information on the progress of the war? 
Will it turn into a war of attrition and of positions? Is there 
a possibility of resolving it? 
  [Muhammad] What is going on now is attrition of Yemen's 
military and material resources. The balance of power is what 
will determine the course of the war on the ground. 
  [Sabra] There is talk now about a salvation government in 
the 
southern part of the country. Do you think that the return of 
each part to its previous borders is projected as a solution? 
  [Muhammad] In principle, I am opposed to separation. I was 
the first to sign the 1972 unity accord. My name has been tied 
to numerous unity accords, to a united Yemen, and to some other 
accords. I am opposed to secession. 
  [Sabra] How are matters proceeding now? 
  [Muhammad] The issue is no longer an issue of separation of 
North from South or of returning to the pre-1990 condition. 
  [Sabra] There is repeated talk about mini-states. 
  [Muhammad] Yes, Yemen may break up. 
  [Sabra] Hadhramaut may become a state, for example, Ta'izz a 
state, and Aden a state? 
  [Muhammad] Yes, more than one state may come into existence 
and they may become a source of concern for the entire region 
because of the strategic position Yemen occupies in the Red Sea, 
the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, the Horn of Africa, and the 
Arab Peninsula. 
  [Sabra] If there is danger from this war to the countries 
adjacent to Yemen, then can these countries intervene and is it 
possible that the entire issue will seem to be an invitation to 
the neighboring countries to intervene? 
  [Muhammad] My information is that the neighboring countries 
have declared their support for unity and that they are for 
resolving the problem [peacefully]. GCC [Gulf Cooperation 
Council] statements, the statements of Saudi sources in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and of all the other countries support 
a peaceful solution to the problem. I haven't personally heard 
of any plans for intervention. 
  [Sabra] Christopher has said that there are some countries 
that help the South and others that help the North and that 
weapons from neighboring countries are being amassed by the 
Southerners and the Northerners. What do these statements mean? 
  [Muhammad] I know nothing specific about this issue. If the 
Americans have learned of this matter, then I don't have 
adequate information on the accumulation of weapons on both 
sides. 
  [Sabra] Pelletreau [U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state 
for Near Eastern Affairs] arrived in Muscat in this period 
during which war is flaring in Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] I believe that his visit to Muscat came as a part 
of a tour of the region. He also visited Yemen, Muscat, the UAE 
[United Arab Emirates], Doha, and Bahrain. 
  [Sabra] Accidentally or what? 
  [Muhammad] I don't think that Pelletreau planned the tour to 
coincide with the battles in Yemen. He happened to be in the 
region on the first day in which the battles erupted. 
  [Sabra] Do you think that the war broke out because the 
south 
wants to return to the pre-1990 condition and because the north 
wants to control both parts of Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] In fact, I am opposed to the names North and 
South. 
  [Sabra] Well then, let us call them the YSP [Yemeni 
Socialist 
Party] in the South and the GPC [General Peoples Congress] in 
the North. 
  [Muhammad] The problem isn't a problem of North and South. 
We 
are now a single people in Yemen. We can talk about the dispute 
between the YSP and the GPC. 
<H5>  They All Use Excuses </H5>
  [Sabra] What does the YSP want of the war? 
  [Muhammad] They all use the Pledge and Accord Document as an 
excuse. They all emphasize the issue of implementing the 
Document. The YSP puts the emphasis on implementing the Pledge 
and Accord Document. 
  [Sabra] But what has happened is the opposite. 
  [Muhammad] In one of my interviews with AL-SHIRA', I said 
that the Pledge and Accord Document needs institutions to 
implement it. I said that if the institutions, such as the 
Presidential Council, the Cabinet, and the House of 
Representatives don't agree, the alternative will be anarchy, 
tension, and war. 
  [Sabra] It seems that agreement has turned into a devouring 
act. 
  [Muhammad] What we are interested in is agreement, harmony, 
understanding, and dialogue. 
  [Sabra] Is there still a chance of understanding and 
dialogue? 
  [Muhammad] The door of dialogue is always open, and it can 
never be shut. 
  [Sabra] Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih reaches the gates of 
Aden and occupies it? 
  [Muhammad] The door of dialogue remains open. People fight 
and then engage in dialogue. 
  [Sabra] When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih occupies Aden, what 
dialogue will there be? 
  [Muhammad] I embrace the principle and I mean that the door 
of dialogue remains open. I am not talking of who will occupy 
what 
  [Sabra] Dialogue is possible if there is equality between 
the 
two sides. But if the situation turns into a situation where 
there is a victor and a vanquished, then there will be 
capitulation, not dialogue. 
  [Muhammad] One statement I have heard is that they haven't 
closed the door of dialogue with the YSP. In his latest 
statement, which I have heard through the media and on 
television, the House of Representatives speaker said that he 
will not close the door of dialogue with the YSP. 
  [Sabra] But words change completely when one of the two 
parties is fighting at the gates of the other party's capital. 
In this instance, the language of dialogue is suspended and the 
language of bone-crushing begins. So, is there a possibility of 
dialogue? 
  [Muhammad] I still stress the principle of dialogue. There 
can be no solution without dialogue, even under the canopy of 
war. 
  [Sabra] This is true. But who will conduct the dialogue? 
  [Muhammad] Didn't you have war and conflicts in Lebanon and 
wasn't there dialogue afterwards? 
  [Sabra] Yes, but Syria entered Lebanon and conducted 
dialogue 
among the parties concerned after separating the combatants and 
ending the war. Do you think that there is an Arab country that 
can lead the dialogue in Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] In Yemen, Arab countries and the Arab League can 
help the country overcome this crisis through dialogue, because 
intervention will not help resolve the crisis. 
  [Sabra] What is the mechanism for Arab intervention? An Arab 
League delegation arrived in Yemen and stayed there for four 
days, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih didn't receive it. Salih didn't 
answer Egyptian President Husni Mubarak for four full days. 
  [Muhammad] But he did receive the delegation recently. 
  [Sabra] He received it on Husni Mubarak's insistence. It 
took 
him four days to answer Mubarak's telephone call! This means 
that he rejects any dialogue and any intervention by another 
party. In your opinion, can an Arab country, such as Egypt, 
Syria, or Saudi Arabia, conduct dialogue between the two sides 
after putting a halt to the war first? 
  [Muhammad] Efforts by Egypt and Syria and, as I have already 
pointed out, by the countries which contributed initially, such 
as Amman [Jordan] and Oman, are needed. 
  [Sabra] How about the United States and France who have 
their 
observers? 
  [Muhammad] And the UAE and the Arab League as well. 
  [Sabra] And what about Saudi Arabia? 
  [Muhammad] I urged the brothers in the GCC at an early phase 
to cooperate and help Yemen contain the crisis, because Yemen 
and the Arab Peninsula are like one body. If a part of the body 
is ailing, the rest of the body rallies to help it. 
  This is why I urge the brothers in the GCC to take any 
initiative to halt the war, to conduct dialogue, and to impose a 
peaceful solution. I have heard that they are eager to do so. 
<H5>  Opposed to Arab Forces in Yemen </H5>
  [Sabra] You have constantly opposed the presence of an Arab 
army to separate the combatants because Yemen is a single 
country and, therefore, there is no need for an Arab army. Do 
you still hold to your opinion? 
  [Muhammad] By God, I do. President Mubarak has said: we 
cannot be a policeman to separate the combatants. The Egyptians 
have asserted that they are not for the intervention of forces 
to separate the combatants. I still hold to my opinion because 
the problem will not be solved by Arab forces but by dialogue. 
The efforts of the Arab League committee can help. 
  [Sabra] When do you think the Arab countries will intervene? 
  [Muhammad] I have learned that the Arab League delegation 
returning from Sanaa has asserted that the door of dialogue has 
been reopened. 
  [Sabra] But this delegation was a military delegation, 
headed 
by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, former commander of the Syrian 
forces in Lebanon. What I mean is that this delegation has no 
political dimension. 
  [Muhammad] I have learned from reliable sources that Yemen 
has emphasized its willingness to receive a delegation from the 
Arab League and from the Arab countries. 
  [Sabra] Under the shadow of guns? 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi has 
stated that in all battles, dialogue takes place on the 
peripheries. It is dialogue under the canopy of war and guns. 
  [Muhammad] We went through this experience in the 1972 war, 
the 1979 war, and the 1981 war. There were battles and there was 
dialogue [simultaneously]. 
  [Sabra] Could the war last another month? 
  [Muhammad] In my experience as prime minister, there were 
wars with Sanaa. Through dialogue, we settled our problems and 
contained the crisis. 
  [Sabra] At the time, you were two states. Now, you are a 
single state in which one of the two sides excludes dialogue. It 
is the opinion of this side that the other side is a group of 
outlaws, not another state. 
  [Muhammad] We were two states, and yet we engaged in 
dialogue. Now, there is a coalition government that includes all 
sides. 
  [Sabra] Have you asked President Hafiz al-Asad to intervene 
in the Yemen issue? 
  [Muhammad] I haven't asked President al-Asad to intervene 
because Syria took the initiative on its own. Through telephone 
calls with President Salih and Vice President al-Bid and with 
the delegations dispatched to Damascus, President al-Asad has 
asserted that Syria is keen on Yemen's unity and on a peaceful 
resolution of the problems. 
  [Sabra] Is there a mechanism to activate this assertion and 
turn it into a reality? Do you imagine that Syria would send an 
army to Yemen to separate the combatants? 
  [Muhammad] This question should be addressed to the Syrians. 
  [Sabra] Could you, as a [former] Yemeni official and a 
Yemeni 
conscience, ask Syria to send forces to separate the combatants? 
  [Muhammad] I couldn't make such a request officially. But by 
virtue of my friendship, I have urged the Syrian brothers to 
redouble their efforts to contain the crisis, not to dispatch 
forces. I cannot really talk about this issue. 
<H5>  My Supporters Here and There </H5>
  [Sabra] What does the presence of Brigadier General 
'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur, who is one of your supporters, as defense 
minister mean? 
  [Muhammad] It means that he is the defense minister. 
  [Sabra] What does it mean to you? Were you consulted or is 
his appointment meant to please you and to solicit your 
participation? 
  [Muhammad] Brother 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur is a YSP Permanent 
Committee member. He is well known as my supporter, and I don't 
deny this. He is also a certified military capability in Yemen. 
  [Sabra] Was he selected on agreement with you? 
  [Muhammad] You know that during the honeymoon between the 
GPC 
and YSP in 1989 and after my departure from Sanaa to Damascus, 
there was, regrettably, a division... 
  [Sabra] Of power and weapons. 
  [Muhammad] And wealth and the clique. In the past, the 
brothers in Aden used to call my faction the "clique." 
  [Sabra] And you called them the "band." 
  [Muhammad] This is why I say they divided power, wealth, and 
the clique. 
  [Sabra] They ruined everything when they imitated 
al-Qadhdhafi... 
  [Muhammad] When some brothers, including 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur 
and Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Husayni, who was appointed navy commander 
recently, joined the GPC, other brothers joined the YSP, 
including Amin Hasan Yahya, 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Qadir, and 
Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, who are the latest to join the YSP. 
  [Sabra] Is this a Yemeni tactic? 
  [Muhammad] I have nothing to do with the way in which the 
brothers have shared the clique. I left it up to the colleagues 
to make their own choice, letting each select the party it 
wishes to join because political action is subsidiary action. 
  [Sabra] There are those who believe that when 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih settles the situation in the South finally and isolates 
the YSP, he will enlist your help so you will become the 
alternative. 
  [Muhammad] I am not interested in power. What interests me 
is 
a studies center. 
  [Sabra] You need a country to establish a studies center. 
Will there continue to be a Yemen so there can be a center? 
  [Muhammad] I am certain that Yemen will remain united, that 
the capital will be Sanaa, and that the center will be in Sanaa. 
But as to when the time to inaugurate the center will come, this 
is something that I will leave for the future. 
<H5>  Except Oil </H5>
  [Sabra] If the oil fields are exposed to danger, do you 
think 
the Americans will intervene, either directly or indirectly? 
  [Muhammad] I don't believe the brothers will play with fire 
in this region. 
  [Sabra] Will these battles spare the oil fields? 
  [Muhammad] It isn't permitted to get close to the oil 
fields. 
  [Sabra] And if they do? 
  [Muhammad] It isn't permitted. Moreover, this oil doesn't 
belong to the Americans. It belongs to the Yemeni people. 
  [Sabra] This is true theoretically. But practically, the 
Americans are the party that will benefit form the oil. 
  [Muhammad] The fires will not burn the Americans and [their] 
firms but the Yemeni people's interests and wealth. 
  [Sabra] Will the United States intervene to protect the 
Yemeni people's interests or its interests? 
  [Muhammad] I don't believe that the fires will get close to 
the oil fields. The battles that have taken place so far haven't 
affected the wells or the companies operating there. 
  [Sabra] If one of the two sides senses that it will lose the 
war, is it possible that this side could use the oil card to 
blackmail, pressure, or ambush other countries to intervene? 
  [Muhammad] It is my assessment that whoever does such a 
thing 
will commit suicide and will meet his end. Whoever thinks of 
such a thing is a madman who doesn't deserve respect and doesn't 
deserve to live in Yemen. 
  [Sabra] What is the solution to the current situation in 
Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] God knows. 
  [Sabra] It seems that you aren't pleased with the conditions 
in Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] And neither are you. 
  [Sabra] When I first called you, you expressed your 
willingness to speak as if you possessed new given facts. 
  [Muhammad] All the statements are conflicting statements 
now. 
I believe that what is going on in Yemen now is a crime against 
the Yemeni people. 
  [Sabra] How do you explain the emergence of 'Abdallah 
al-Ahmar with such prominence in the past two days? 
  [Muhammad] He is one of the coalition leaders. 
  [Sabra] His statements have been so overwhelming they make 
it 
sound as if he is the actual ruler in Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] I don't think so. He is one of the parties to the 
ruling coalition. 
  [Sabra] Salim Salih says that Yemen is approaching a 
fundamentalist regime. 
  [Muhammad] It is difficult for me to confirm this. I don't 
believe that the fundamentalists can gain power. Anyway, the 
religious tendency is a participant in the coalition, with the 
GPC and YSP. 
  [Sabra] It is also a participant in the conflict. 
  [Muhammad] Yes. 
  [Sabra] Do Salim Salih's statements sort of incite the 
United 
States and the neighboring countries against the fundamentalists 
and scare them with the fundamentalist presence in Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] I have heard no such statements. 
  [Sabra] He made them this evening. 
  [Muhammad] It could be some sort of propaganda warfare. 
  [Sabra] May God protect Yemen from what is more dangerous. 
  [Muhammad] We appreciate your concern for Yemen and your 
followup on the situation there. 
  [Sabra] We have supported Yemen's unity enthusiastically. 
  [Muhammad] We are torn by the news we hear. My heart aches 
for Yemen because this issue concerns unity of the entire Arab 
nation. We appreciate your interest in and your followup on 
Yemen. We hope that problems will be solved, that the wounds 
will heal, and that we will meet soon. 
  [Sabra] God willing.
