AL-AWSAT bureau in Amman: "Restructuring of the Northern and 
Southern Commands Paves the Way for a New Phase in the Yemeni 
War"] 
  [Excerpts] According to Yemeni military sources, battles 
raged yesterday in the town of Zinjibar and extended to 
al-Bayda' Governorate in the north in the areas of al-Kawd and 
al-'Urqub and all the way to Mukayris. It seems that the 
northern al-'Amaliqah forces deployed there are drawning their 
last breath. The northern command had pinned great hopes on them 
for victory and for the occupation of Aden, and they were 
considered the pincers in the area to the north of Aden. 
  As regards the other forces which have been trying to 
besiege 
Aden from the north and the west in the 
Ta'izz-al-Rahidah-Mawiyah axis, they have withdrawn from the 
borders and from the areas they had occupied to the north of 
Ta'izz Governorate. [passage omitted] 
  In the course of the re-formation of the southern command, 
new appointments have been made in the various sectors as 
follows: 
  1. The eastern front (the governorates of Shabwah and 
Hadramaut): The operations there are supervised by Salih 
Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, former oil and mineral resources minister 
and chief of staff in the south. 
  2. The Abyan-al-Bayda' front is under the command of Abyan 
Governor Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad. 
  3. The Kirsh front is under the command of Colonel Qasim 
Bin-Yahya. 
  4. The Maqtabah front is under the command of Salih 'Ubayd 
Ahmad, former deputy prime minister who was defense minister 
before the unity. 
  5. The Ta'izz and Ibb brigades are under the command of 
Housing and Planning Minister Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah (Muhsin) 
and Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar (both members of the 
Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]), and 
Sultan al-Sami'i, the formerly independent deputy. 
  As regards the northern command, it has been formed as 
follows: 
  1. Ahmad Musa'id Husayn (member of the General Committee -- 
the Political Bureau -- of the General People's Congress [GPC]): 
Command of the Shabwah front. 
  2. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the new defense minister, and 
Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Husayni: Al-Bayda' command. 
  All three of them [as published] are former south Yemeni 
President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad's men. 
  3. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Muhammad Salim Basindwah, 
Ahmad Faraj, and 'Abdallah al-Qadi: Ta'izz command. 
  4. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani and a group of central areas 
officers: Ibb command. 
  5. (Central Security Commander) Muhammad 'Abdallah Salih, 
(Air Force Commander) 'Ali Salih al-Ahmar, (1st Armored Division 
Commander) 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, and (Information Minister) 
Hasan al-Lawzi: Sanaa area command. The aim is to purge it of 
the political parties and others who sympathize with the YSP. 
  6. 'Abd-al-Rahman Muhammad 'Ali 'Uthman, 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-zayn, and other leadership and staff members: Command of 
al-Hudaydah front. 
  Meanwhile, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained some information 
about the arrest of a group of Sudanese and Iraqis in Aden and 
the arrest of 60 members of the extremist Afghan Jihad members 
in al-Dali'. There is information confirming that Eritrea has 
admitted into its airports a group of northern civilian planes 
which were taken to Asmara Airport out of fear that they might 
have been a target of attack at the airports of Ta'izz, Sanaa, 
and al-Hudaydah. 
  Although YSP sources have refused to confirm that Eritrean 
airports were used in the Yemeni war, some reports say that the 
southerners bombed Asmara airport after discovering that 
northern military aircraft had taken off from there. 
  The reports add that the north paid Eritrean President 
Isaias 
Afewerki $20 million for allowing the planes into his country's 
airport. 
  Sources close to the Yemeni Defense Ministry have told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the southern 'Abbud Brigade, in 
cooperation with the public in al-Dali' Directorate in the Lahij 
Governorate, successfully confronted the attack launched by 
northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
consisting of al-Hamzah Brigade reinforced by selected 
Republican Guard forces. The Defense Ministry in Aden said the 
result was a "crushing" defeat for the northern forces which had 
to retreat. 
  The sources said that the 'Abbud Brigade's forces, which are 
under the command of Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General 
Haytham Qasim Tahir, captured 15 tanks and destroyed 10 tanks 
and a number of vehicles and troop carriers, but the Defense 
Ministry did not give the human losses on both sides. 
  Sanaa has not denied that report to close politicians and 
reporters, who are finding it difficult to contact the outside 
world and who see Sanaa's silence about these battles of the 
past two days as an indication that the results were not in its 
favor. 
  Sources of the Yemeni Defense Ministry in the south said 
that 
four of Sanaa's Russian-made aircraft were shot down as they 
attacked civilian targets in Aden. Two of the pilots were 
captured. One of them is an Egyptian Islamic extremist and the 
other an Iraqi from the Iraqi Air Force. The other two were 
killed when their two aircraft exploded in mid-air. 
  The sources attribute the use of Iraqi pilots in the Yemeni 
war to the weakness of north Yemeni pilots and the warm 
relations between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn. Before the outbreak of battles, 
political and press sources said that a number of Iraqi military 
experts had arrived in Sanaa. [passage omitted] 
  In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Damascus, 
Yemeni military sources said that the planes which bombed Aden 
were Yemeni planes which took off from military airfields in 
Eritrea and were flown by Iraqi pilots. It seems that Iraq 
entered the battle through Eritrea after the latter was paid 
large sums of money. [passage omitted]
