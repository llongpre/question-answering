<F P=106> [Lutfi Shatarah report: "Sharp Differences Between Salih </F>
and His Military Commanders Over Appointment of 'Abd-Rabbuh 
Mansur as Defense Minister"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Two weeks after the outbreak of 
battles in Yemen between the northern and southern regular 
forces, serious indications have appeared on the ground 
supporting the southern leaders' claims that the war is not 
between the "legitimate forces" and "a group of mutineers from 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]," as claimed by Sanaa, but 
rather that it is a fierce war between northern forces supported 
by the militias of the Yemeni Reform Grouping led by Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, elements of the outlawed Jihad 
Organization, Afghan Arab groups from Sudan and other Arab 
states, and Iraqi military experts on the one hand, and southern 
forces on the other. 
  The southern resistance is continuing against the northern 
forces trying to breach southern defenses in several areas with 
the aim of putting pressure on Aden to force the YSP leaders to 
leave the country or surrender, that being the view of President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who has conveyed to the Arab League 
delegation his rejection of any cease-fire initiatives. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the political level, it has been revealed that sharp 
differences have emerged between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and the northern military commanders over the appointment of 
'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, a supporter of former south Yemeni 
President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, as defense minister. Sources 
have confirmed that Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, President 
Salih's half-brother, rejected that decision and that a number 
of northern military commanders maintained that as they were 
fighting southern regular forces, they would not accept a 
southern officer's assuming responsibility for the northern 
forces, whatever his political position against the southern 
leaders. 
  The sources said that President Salih proposed a compromise 
solution to prevent a military mutiny in the current 
circumstances, and he agreed to freeze the new minister's powers 
until after the war and after settlement of the porblem, but 
some northern commanders are pressing for the appointment of 
'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar as defense minister. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Muhsin Muhammad Bin-Farid, leader of the Sons of 
Yemen League, has stated that the aim of the announcement of the 
declaration of principles initiative signed the day before 
yesterday by the YSP and the opposition's National Bloc was to 
stop the fighting, form a government of national salvation, and 
thoroughly investigate who caused the fighting. 
  He warned that the opposition would stand against any side 
which did not respond to the initiative -- in a hint to the 
leaders of the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni 
Reform Grouping. He added that Sanaa's rejection of the 
initiative left no alternative but the mobilization of all 
military, human, and moral resources to make Sanaa understand 
that no solution could be imposed by military force and that 
there must be a return to reason and to dialogue for the 
implementation of the national consensus document. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Bin-Farid added: "We 
have our own human resources, intrinsic capabilities, tribal 
relations, and the feeling that there is a right which must be 
upheld." He emphasized that the opposition devotes all its 
resources, big or small, to stopping this mad war. He also 
said: "Unity can only continue with the approval of the parties 
concerned, not by coercion and armed force. This war has been a 
blow to unity. [quotation marks as published]
