  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said that the Hashemite 
Jordanian position on the Palestine question in general, and the 
issue of Jerusalem in particular, has been an honorable one 
based on enlightened principles of right and justice free of 
delusion and ambiguity and incapable of change or alteration. 
He added: Jerusalem is Arab and Islamic; its covenant is 
'Umarite [a pledge Caliph 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab gave to 
Christians when he entered Jerusalem]; and its safeguard is 
Hashemite and is based on the determination of Husayn Bin-'Ali, 
who is buried there, and the vision of 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn, 
its martyr. It is along their path that we are marching. 
  In a letter to Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, 
ordering the re-formation of the Royal Committee for Jerusalem 
Affairs under the chairmanship of His Highness Crown Prince 
Hasan, his majesty the king added: On the blessed occasion of 
al-Isra' and al-Mi'raj [Prophet Muhammad's midnight journey from 
Mecca to Jerusalem and his ascension to heaven], we redouble our 
faith in the value of holy shrines and Jerusalem--this immortal 
city which has recently been witnessing a difficult and 
complicated situation and is facing an ambiguous destiny, 
something that underscores our duty toward it. It is dear to us 
and lies deep into our hearts. We feel that any Arab or Islamic 
relinquishment regarding it will be recorded in history with 
pain and regret. 
  His Majesty King Husayn said: In order for the committee to 
shoulder its noble responsibilities, achieve its lofty aims, and 
follow up every affair related to Jerusalem and the holy shrines 
in the religious, historical, political, cultural, information, 
and legal domains, we order that the Royal Committee for 
Jerusalem Affairs be re-formed under the chairmanship of my dear 
brother His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan and the membership 
of the following: His Excellency Field Marshal 'Abd-al-Rahman 
Siwar al-Dhahab, His Excellency Ahmad al-Talib al-Ibrahimi, His 
Eminence Shaykh Ahmad al-Khalil, His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad 
al-Mukhtar al-Salami, His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Taqiy-al-Din 
al-'Uthmani, His Eminence Dr. Fadil al-Husayn al-Jilani, His 
Eminence Shaykh Isma'il Bin-'Ali al-Akwa', His Excellency Dr. 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Duri, his excellency the minister of 
information, his eminence the chief justice, His excellency the 
minister of awqaf and Islamic affairs, his excellency the 
minister of state for foreign affairs, His Excellency Dr. Hazim 
Nusaybah, His Excellency 'Abdallah Salah, His Excellency Dr. 
Jamal Nasir, His Excellency Dr. Kamil Abu-Jabir, His Excellency 
Dr. Nasir-al-Din al-Asad, Bishop Salim al-Sa'igh, Bishop Samir 
Qaf'iti, His Excellency Dr. Muhammad 'Adnan al-Bakhit, Father 
Qustantin Qarmash, and His Excellency 'Awn al-Khasawinah. 
  His Majesty King Husayn had earlier sent a letter to Akram 
Zu'aytir, expressing his profound thanks and appreciation for 
him and for the [former] members of the Royal Committee for 
Jerusalem Affairs.
