<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah, Hani Naqshabandi, Salih Qallab, </F>
and Hanan al-Badri: "Sanaa: Aden Is a Must, Even If the War 
Continues"] 
  [Excerpts] While Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN 
secretary general, continues to race against time to avert what 
he described as a big tragedy that would afflict Yemen if the 
fighting between northern and southern forces is not halted, 
Yemeni Defense Minister Colonel 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi has stated that 
Sanaa is determined to enter Aden. He also stressed that the 
leadership in the north is discussing how to storm the city 
without harming its residents. [passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi, member of the General People's 
Congress General Committee, has revealed that Sanaa has made 
contacts with Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders whom it 
described as moderate both before and after the war broke out. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT al-'Anasi listed the 
names of some of these leaders. They include Salim Salih 
Muhammad, the No. 2 in the YSP, and Dr. Yasir Sa'id Nu'man, 
chairman of the Central Committee secretariat. 
  Al-'Anasi said that Sanaa is offering concessions "from a 
strong position and for the sake of sparing Yemeni blood." He 
stressed that Sanaa's basic conditions still stand, especially 
with regard to incriminating the 16 people who declared and have 
perpetuated the secession, including YSP leader 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid and Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. 
  But 'Ali Salih 'Abbad Muqbil, member of the YSP Political 
Bureau and member of the Yemeni parliament speakership, has 
stressed that Sanaa knows that there are concessions it is going 
to make regarding these people. However, he ruled out the YSP's 
backtracking on the decision to secede. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Muqbil said that the 
appointment of northerners in the new Aden government confirms 
that the YSP does not rule out the possibility of returning to 
unity once again. 
  He said that the state proclaimed in the south is a 
preparation for a new state under unity. 
  He stressed that Sanaa tacitly agrees to the presence of 
international observers, but it fears that that might perpetuate 
the secession. [passage omitted]
