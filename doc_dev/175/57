  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP], received two telephone calls yesterday 
afternoon from his brothers, Egyptian President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak and Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan al Nuhayyan, the president 
of the United Arab Emirates. President Muhammad Husni Mubarak 
and Shaykh Zayid expressed their great concern over the 
situation in Yemen and the continued fighting there. They 
stressed their strongest determination to continue making all 
possible efforts to stop the fighting between the sons of the 
united Yemen. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid reiterated his thanks and 
appreciation for the efforts of both presidents, Husni Muharak 
and Shaykh Zayid. Those efforts were aimed at stopping the 
bloodshed in Yemen, which began after the launch of the doomed 
war by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his secessionist and 
adventuristic gang after he lost patience with the widespread 
agreement and overall national consensus regarding the pledge 
and accord document. The brother deputy chairman of the 
Presidential Council briefed his two brothers, Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak and Zayid Bin-Sultan, about developments in the military 
situation along all the axes of the fighting. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid has also spoken on the telephone 
with his brother, His Majesty King Husayn of Jordan. He briefed 
him on the situation in Yemen which resulted from the ill-fated 
war sparked off by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Brother 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid expressed great appreciation for the role played by 
Jordan in attempting to stop the deterioration of the situation 
in Yemen. He confirmed his earnestness in responding to all 
fraternal and friendly efforts to return to political dialogue, 
and to submit to the true and serious implementation of the 
pledge and accord document.
