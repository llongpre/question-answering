  [Text] Brother Salim Salih Muhammad, Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] Presidential Council member, talked by phone from his 
place of residence in London with brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy 
of Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary general, who is currently 
in Jeddah continuing his efforts to stop the fighting, prevent 
Yemeni bloodshed, and implement the Security Council's 
resolution. 
  During the contact, brother Salim Salih Muhammad explained 
the recent developments, Sanaa's refusal to abide by the 
cease-fire, and the imposition of a state of siege on Aden by 
threatening to cut the water supplies, hit the economic and 
civilian utilities and shell the popular quarters without 
discrimination, a matter which led to the killing of hundreds of 
women, children, and old men. He affirmed to him the importance 
of speeding up the implementation of the Security Council's 
resolution and sending international observers to supervise the 
ceasefire and start the talks, or take deterrent measures 
against the side which rejected these international resolutions. 
  Lakhdar Brahimi affirmed the importance of stopping the 
fighting and implementing the Security Council's resolutions 
immediately, and that he was about to meet 'Ali Salim al-Bid and 
the other leaders in order to enable him to submit his report to 
Butrus- Ghali, UN secretary general, who would in turn present 
it to the UN Security Council to take additional resolutions 
which would lead to the imposition of the state of stability and 
peace in Yemen and the rest of the region.
