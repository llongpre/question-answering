  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Rival Yemeni troops 
clashed Monday leaving four dead and 20 wounded, a Defence 
Ministry source said. 
  The fighting broke out a day after country's leaders signed 
a 
deal patching up their differences. 
  A tank was also destroyed when brigades from the north and 
south fought for an hour in the Abyan region, 100 kilometres (60 
miles) east Aden, a source close to Defense Minister Haytham 
Qasim Tahir said. 
  Each side accused the other of sparking the clash after 
moving troops toward the old border between the former North 
Yemen and poorer South Yemen, which merged in 1990. 
  On Sunday, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his 
southern rival Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid met in the 
Jordanian capital Amman to sign a deal calling for major 
economic, political and military reforms. 
  The accord, aimed at ending a dispute which threatened to 
split the country, called for withdrawing troops facing each 
other along the old border and banned troop movements in cities 
and on main roads. 
  Monday's fighting ended after the intervention of a military 
commission that had been set up to implement withdrawals, 
officials said. 
  Salim Salih Muhammad, a top YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] 
official and member of the Presidential Council, also told AFP 
that Salih, al-Bid and Jordan's King Husayn had contacted 
officials in Abyan to restore calm. 
  King Husayn said Sunday that the accord was "a positive 
start 
for Arabs to settle their own differences." 
  Muhammad accused northern troops of having deployed further 
south, closer to Aden. But a northern official who asked not to 
be named alleged that southern troops had moved forward. 
[passage omitted] 
  Al-Bid underlined his commitment to the accord despite 
"reservations and wounds." He said he could visualize the faces 
of relatives killed in political violence, but "Yemen is dearer 
to us. 
  "We are going to turn over a new leaf...and we will start 
applying this document," Al-Bid added. Salih thanked the 
United States and European Union for helping in the 
reconciliation.
