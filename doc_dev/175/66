  [Text] At the request of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdalllah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and 
supreme commander of the Armed Forces, Muhammad Hasan Dammaz, 
minister of local administration, today visited al-Dali' 
District, which has been purged of the Yemeni Socialist Party's 
renegade and secessionist clique. The minister attended a large 
rally in the city of al-Dali' and addressed crowds from the 
district. 
  At the beginning, he conveyed the greetings of brother 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
as well as his wishes and congratulations to them and to our 
Yemeni people on the victory over the renegade and secessionist 
clique. He said this great victory was achieved thanks to God 
and the will of our people and all honorable unionists 
everywhere in the Republic of Yemen. He said this victory which 
you have achieved made us and every Yemeni citizen proud. He 
said that purging the al-Dali' District, as well as the victory 
achieved by the heroes of the Armed Forces in it, has restored 
the people's confidence in themselves and in their unity. 
  The city of al-Dali', he said, is the city of heroic deeds 
and bravery and the gate of victory that will correct the course 
of unity, which will be devoid of factionalism, sectarianism, 
cronyism, or regionalism, and which is considered a victory from 
almighty God and a victory of right over wrong. He urged all 
the sons of the district and all those who left it to return to 
their families. He said the state and its leaders will protect 
them, provide security for them, and take care of them, 
stressing that no harm will come to them. This is, he said, a 
promise from Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
and from all officials in the Presidential Council, the 
government, and the leadership. 
  He said that the state and Lt. Gen. brother 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih have issued their instructions to implement an electricity 
and water project in the city of al-Dali', stressing that the 
project will be implemented immediately. 
  Brother 'Abd-al-Qadir 'Ali Hilal, deputy governor of the Ibb 
Governorate, also delivered a speech to the crowds, hailing the 
steadfastness of the heroic sons of al-Dali' District, their 
support for Constitutional legitimacy, their defense of unity 
and democracy, their efforts to entrench the state of order and 
law, and their effective participation in defeating the forces 
of renegade and secession. He added that the brother leader 
president had asked him to form several committees to register 
the names of the martyrs and the wounded and the names of those 
whose houses were destroyed by the forces of renegade and 
secession. This, he said, will take place quickly in order to 
ease the suffering of the sons of the district, who faced 
disasters at the hands of secessionists before the restoration 
of the Yemeni Unity and during the years that followed it, 
stressing that victory is for our people, our revolution, and 
our unity, and that defeat is for the secessionists. The rally 
was attended by Ibb Commander Colonel Muhammad Ahmad al- 
Zayyani, al-Dali' District head Muhammad Isma'il Muqbil, and 
several officials from A'tabah and (?Dimzah) districts. 
  The minister of local administration met with the commanders 
of the military units and officials in the al-Dali' District and 
discussed with them various issues of interest to the district 
and its sons. He also inspected (?Dimz) District, met officials 
from it, and listened to a number of supply and educational 
issues of interest to the citizens. Several officials from the 
district attended.
