<F P=106> [Speech by 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, "vice chairman of </F>
the Democratic Republic of Yemen Presidential Council"; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] Dear brother citizens, I am honored to speak to 
you, in order to inform you as to what is happening in the 
country. On the political level, President 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
has played an extraordinary role, politically and militarily, in 
the mobilization in Hadramawt and Shabwah. Regarding 
international contacts, Brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas left 
yesterday evening, accompanied by Muhsin Muhammad Abu-Bakr Bin 
Farid, the deputy prime minister and minister of planning and 
development; and brother Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad, the deputy prime 
minister and minister of transportion; for a number of Arab 
countries, beginning with Saudi Arabia, where they are now. 
Brother 'Abdallah al-Asnaj will go to a few countries and then 
to New York, to work together with Dr. 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Dali, to 
build the pillars of the fledgling Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  At the military level we are, unfortunately, fighting a 
brutal enemy; we say a brutal enemy knowing that the people in 
the north are brothers of ours in Arabism, Islam, and in the 
homeland, but the officials of Sanaa are waging this unjustified 
attack in the name of a unity which could, in any way, be on the 
skulls of the people and through [words indistinct]. They 
issued orders to destroy all villages in their way. Our people, 
the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, and the 
volunteers, led by the hero Brother Haytham Qasim Tahir, and all 
commanders of axes and commanders of all the armies, 
particularly the air force, are resisting. [passage omitted] 
  We did not initiate secession, it was Sanaa's rulers who 
started the separation when they rejected all the initiatives 
calling for a cease-fire. [passage indistinct] 
  We are the advocates of unity, and we will, God willing, 
build our Republic as a real model of justice and equality. We 
will unite with any ruler from Sanaa, provided he sets up the 
same regime on the same bases and principles. We will give our 
lives and blood so that our people are not subjected to 
despotism, injustice, and corruption. 
  One more point: We would like to send a message to our 
brothers in the Democratic Republic of Yemen, some of whom have 
joined us, and some who are still siding with the other party 
for either few dirhams, or because of old old scores. [passage 
indistinct] We said why do we not [word indistinct] a historic 
reconciliation between the people of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen. [passage indistinct] We warned many times against 
ignoring the UN Security Council's resolution, but our brothers, 
the rulers of Sanaa, refuse to observe the UN Security Council's 
resolutions, or any call from any quarter, whether Arab or [word 
indistinct]. 
  We call on those fraternal and brotherly countries to use 
their pressure and influence on those who could not get rid of 
their complexes, and who failed to comprehend the meaning of 
contemporary times, defying international legitimacy -- as if 
past lessons taught to other countries were not enough. 
  We will fight to the last inch for our country, we will not 
allow the occupation of our country, and we will resist them 
with all the force we have. We realize that our people are 
standing behind us, and that they will fight beside us, whatever 
the price. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to make an important point: We in this state -- 
president, government, and people, will resist [passage 
indistinct]. We do not want to kill, or fight, but we have the 
right to defend every inch of our land. On this occasion, I 
call on the youngsters in [words indistinct] to unite with us. 
Popular resistance groups have begun being formed, and they 
will be very well organized; they will go to the fronts and we 
will repulse the enemy from Aden, Lahij, Abyan, and Shabwah. 
  Dear citizens, be sure that we would not have taken this 
stance if we were not fully confident of Brother President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, and if we we were not sure that 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih -- we wish he could see reason -- has lost the way and 
waged this barbaric war, which we will not allow to continue. 
[passage omitted]
