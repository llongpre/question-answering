  [Excerpts] The House of Representatives this morning 
started the sessions of the first period of the first round of 
its second annual term under brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn 
al-Ahmar, the House speaker. 
  On the occasion of the House starting its second annual 
term, 
the brother House of Representatives speaker delivered a speech 
in which he congratulated the House of Representatives members 
and the Yemeni people on the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth 
unity anniversary, which will remain a shining point in the 
history of our people and a major turning point in their blessed 
march. 
  The House of Representatives speaker noted that the 
parliamentary elections of 27 April [1993] provided clear 
evidence of our people's awareness and sound instincts. These 
elections, he said, produced a new political reality in the 
Yemeni arena. 
  The House of Representatives speaker noted that the 
secessionist group in the Socialist Party leadership, which led 
the country to war and infighting, had also directed its 
poisonous arrows against the House of Representatives by taking 
advantage of its positions in the state's executive agencies, 
despite the fact that the House had to put up with a great deal 
of arrogance from some of these leaders out of concern for the 
march of goodness and prosperity, and out of concern for 
national unity. 
  After that, the House reviewed and approved the agenda of 
the 
current parliamentary term. The House also listened to and 
approved the minutes of the last session of the previous 
parliamentary term. 
  The House then listened to a letter addressed to it by 
Justice Minister 'Abdallah Ahmad Ghanim on the public actions 
committed by Ahmad 'Ubayd Bin-Daghr, Anis Hasan Yahya, Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, Salim Muhammad Jubran, Qasim 'Abd-al-Rabb, 
and Muhammad 'Ali al- Qayrahi, including the crimes of violating 
the Constitution, attacking citizens and private and public 
property, issuing orders in contravention of the law, and 
organizing rebellion against the public order despite being 
members of the House. He said confirmed information on these 
acts were received from the Defense Ministry, the Interior 
Ministry, and other parties. 
  The justice minister's letter to the House states: 
  We appreciate your positive response to allow us to take the 
legal measures against them in accordance with your 
prerogatives, as stipulated in the Constitution, and in 
accordance with Article 64-F. [passage omitted] In accordance 
with the aforementioned articles and following your permission, 
the Public Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against these 
persons, as well as others. We hope you will take measures to 
inform the House of these details in accordance with the 
aforesaid articles. We will keep your esteemed House informed 
of all developments. 
  The House then discussed the Public Prosecutor's report 
which 
was referred to it by the justice minister. Following a lengthy 
discussion of this subject, the matter was referred to the 
Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee to study it in an 
urgent manner and to present a ruling to the House on the 
request to deprive the members mentioned in the justice 
minister's memorandum on their immunity, in accordance with the 
Constitutional texts and the House of Representatives bylaws 
issued by Law No. 5 of 1990. 
  The people's deputies then discussed al-Bid's declaration 
of secession. The House members, including members of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party bloc, stressed that the declaration of 
secession by al-Bid and his gang is a stab in the heart of every 
Yemeni. Members stressed that the war is between unity and the 
enemies of unity and that everyone supports unity, and that the 
people will sacrifice everything dear to protect it. 
  The House also stressed the need to preserve democracy and 
Constitutional legitimacy and its absolute rejection of any 
foreign intervention in the Republic of Yemen's internal 
affairs, because any intervention or recognition of the 
secessionist gang only expresses a flagrant animosity against 
the entire Yemeni people and a hostility against their 
Constitutional and democratic institutions. 
  The House set up a committee comprising House Members Yahya 
'Ali (al-Ra'i), 'Abdallah Sharaf (al-Humaydi), Yahya Mansur 
Abu-Usba', Muhammad 'Abdallah (al-Kifli), Mansur Ahmad Sayf, 
Muhammad Naji ('Allaw), 'Abdu Muhammad al-Zanadi, Muhammad Yahya 
Hammud (al- Sharafi) to draft a statement refuting the 
declaration of secession, stressing the need to protect unity 
through all means, and urging all states, particularly Arab 
states, to support unity and [words indistinct] overcome the 
sedition that was fabricated by some elements that have turned 
against the Constitution and legitimacy and against the will of 
the people as expressed by the elections of 27 April 1993. 
  The House also set up a committee including members 
'Abdallah 
'Ali (Sa'tar), Muhammad 'Ali Ba Musallam, Sultan Sa'id (al- 
Barakani), 'Abdallah Mahdi 'Abdu, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Rawhani, and 
Sultan (Sayyan al-'Adwani) to draft letters to the Arab League, 
the UN secretary general, and to the parliaments of the 
fraternal and friendly states. 
  The House also asked the government to send the brother 
foreign minister to attend the House's session tomorrow, Sunday 
[29 May], to explain the political situation concerning the 
developments in our country so that the parliament can take the 
necessary steps. 
  Today's session was attended by brother Dr. 'Abd-Salam 
Khalid 
Salman, minister of legal affairs and minister of the House of 
Representatives affairs. The House will resume its sessions 
tomorrow, God willing.
