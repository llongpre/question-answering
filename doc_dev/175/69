  [Text] Cairo, 17 May (MENA)--The repercussions of the war 
between north and south Yemen have been felt in its embassies 
and diplomatic missions abroad, especially after Yemeni Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah issued a decree dismissing a 
number of southern Yemeni diplomats who work in its embassies 
abroad. Among these are Mr. Muhammad Shahir Sayf, acting Yemeni 
representative to the Arab League. 
  Mr. Shahir Sayf described the Yemeni foreign minister's 
request for the Arab League secretariat to withdraw Sayf's 
accreditation and for Sayf to return to Yemen as "unjust and 
illegitimate". 
  He said that Yemeni Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas had instructed him to continue his duties in this 
position. He pointed out that the reason behind the dismissal 
from his duties is because he is a southerner. 
  Muhammad Shahir Sayf said the Yemeni foreign minister's 
decision to remove him from the Yemeni representative office in 
Cairo was a unilateral decision prompted by divisionist notions. 
He noted that the Yemeni foreign minister should have waited 
for the war to end before making such a decision. 
  Mr. Muhammad Shahir Sayf said that he does not take his 
orders from Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, but from 
Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas (a southerner), 
"whom I consider to be the legitimate prime minister despite 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's decision to dismiss 
him", he said. 
  He affirmed that he will stay in his position as acting 
permanent Yemeni representative to the Arab League. He pointed 
out that the representation office has already sent a letter 
regarding this matter to the Arab League Secretariat. 
  MENA has learned that one of the reasons Muhammad Shahir 
Sayf 
was dismissed was that he ignored Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah during the latter's recent visit to 
Cairo. Sayf also, without guidance from Sanaa, declined to head 
the latest emergency session of the Arab League Council. 
  It is worth noting here that Muhammad Shahir Sayf assumed 
his 
current position when Yemen's previous permanent representative 
to the Arab League, Ahmad al-Shajbi, travelled to London for 
treatment, where he died a few days ago and was buried in Cairo.
