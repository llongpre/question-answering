<F P=106> [Report by Munsif al-Sulaymi: "Salim Salih Tells AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: Hassan II's Reception Pleased Us, We Believe 
Recognition Exists Tacitly"] 
  [Excerpts] Rabat -- Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the 
south Yemen Presidential Council and assistant secretary general 
of the Socialist Party, has described Moroccan King Hassan II's 
reception of the South Yemen delegation the evening of the day 
before yesterday as "very useful, and it pleased us." [passage 
omitted] 
  On the possibility of Morocco's recognizing the proclaimed 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, especially as official Moroccan 
media services have said that the Moroccan monarch received the 
delegation of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" [DRY], Salim 
Salih said that "the question of Morocco's recognition [of the 
DRY] tacitly exists, proceeding from our status prior to four 
years of unity which has proved difficult to achieve. Proof of 
this is the existence of two armies, two establishments, two 
currencies, and two regimes." [passage omitted] 
  On his assessment of the causes of the failure of the 
endeavors made by the international envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, he 
said that "we have always responded to all the initiatives, most 
importantly the U.S. and European initiatives. We sought to 
interact with the proposals presented. But most regrettably, 
the other party is focusing on one option -- war, which has 
entered its eighth week and yet has not achieved what the Sanaa 
regime wanted to achieve." [passage omitted] 
  On the prospects for the dialogue with Sanaa regarding a 
mechanism to halt the fighting and how this mechanism can be 
agreed, as the idea was initially endorsed at the Cairo meetings 
headed by Brahimi, he said: I believe that "the other side does 
not at all want to reach clear and specific results regarding a 
cease-fire and choosing the right path. All it is doing is 
getting around the resolutions by giving others the impression 
that it has accepted the resolutions." [passage omitted] 
  Salim Salih Muhammad said that Sanaa has offered no sign or 
hope of withdrawing its forces besieging Aden. He expected the 
war to continue for a long time. He expressed his hope that 
sanctions would be imposed on the side not complying with the 
resolutions of the international will and pushing the region 
into the furnaces of real dangers that threaten security and 
stability. [passage omitted]
