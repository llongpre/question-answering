<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas </F>
by unidentified correspondent on in Amman on 22 February] 
  [Text] [AL-HAYAH] How do you assess the situation, 
especially after the incidents which followed the signing of the 
Pledge and Accord Document? 
  [Al-'Attas] The situation is difficult, particularly as the 
brothers (in the General People's Congress [GPC]) did not, after 
the signing of the agreement, agree to discuss subsequent steps 
to the signing despite the fact that the Socialist Party [YSP] 
submitted a paper which it hoped would be discussed and signed 
as an annex to the Pledge and Accord Document. That paper 
spells out the steps to follow the signing and discusses ways of 
convening the various bodies in pursuance of the provisions of 
the document proceeds. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What about the deteriorating situation at the 
military level, to be specific? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that what has happened at the military 
level can be contained. That is what we have stressed to the 
brothers in Aden, and they are endeavoring to do that despite 
the provocations and improper activities aimed at dividing the 
people. 
  [AL-HAYAH] But do you not believe that the provocations were 
started by the YSP at some point before the signing of the 
document when you appointed Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad as governor of 
Abyan and in doing so flouted the powers of the Presidential 
Council? 
  [Al-'Attas] No, giving Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad the duties of the 
governor of Abyan was a legal step. Furthermore, before he was 
assigned the duties of governor, the GPC brothers took several 
inappropriate steps in Abyan. The latest military provocations 
were only an extension of these steps. At the request of the 
people of Abyan and in order to calm the situation and reassure 
the people, I issued that decision which is based on cabinet law 
no. 20 of 1991 empowering the prime minister to make any 
decisions he deems fit and then submit them to the cabinet 
within one month for consideration. And so I indeed did assign 
the duties of Abyan governor to Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad. The 
strange truth is that the violations are committed by the other 
side. All the security directors are appointed by them without 
any commitment to and completely ignoring the prime minister. 
The same applies to the heads of directorates and many of the 
legal changes they carry out without having the right to do so, 
encroaching on the very essence of the prime minister's powers. 
I am surprised that they have caused this furor in dealing with 
a particular problem to block a step which was taken in the 
public interest and in an attempt to prevent the sedition which 
some are trying to foment. 
  [AL-HAYAH] In your view, is the unity [of Yemen] in danger? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that unity is in the hearts of all the 
good people of Yemen who supported it from the moment it was 
declared and who, in the years following the declaration of 
unity, worked in every possible way to build and consolidate the 
unity state. The fear for unity stems from those who do not 
want to build the unity state and consolidate it to become an 
integral part of the daily life of all compatriots and the basis 
of all central and local practices. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Have these people, then, managed to undermine 
unity? 
  [Al-'Attas] Insistence on their ways, wittingly or 
unwittingly, is harmful to unity. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Let us go back to the military situation. You 
have just received reports about new clashes in Abyan. What is 
your comment on that? 
  [Al-'Attas] At this moment, the military situation can be 
contained but all parties should be willing to do that. I 
believe that the military provocations in Abyan began several 
weeks ago when arms were distributed and when the al-'Amaliqah 
Brigade broke out of the lines within which it was allowed to 
move according to the specific directives of the Defense 
Ministry. As a result, it was deployed in positions which had 
been assigned to the Madram Brigade in Abyan Governorate. That 
led the people to the conclusion that the provocative actions of 
the brigade must be stopped. So, we can say that the deployment 
beyond the designated points was the start of the military 
provocations and it led to the limited clash which claimed the 
lives of a number of Yemeni people. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Let us move to another kind of provocation. Do 
you not believe that the tours of 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Salim 
Salih Muhammad are political provocations? They visited some 
Gulf states without coordination with the rest of the 
Presidential Council members. 
  [Al-'Attas] Why? The president ('Ali 'Abdallah Salih) 
himself used to say that any of the Yemeni leaders should be 
given the opportunity to make such visits. He hoped to do that 
himself. I believe that Shaykh 'Abdallah (Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar) 
made some efforts in that direction but the lack of response was 
clear a long time ago. 
  [AL-HAYAH] In view of the recent developments, what do you 
really want and what can you do? 
  [Al-'Attas] It is possible to prevent infighting and find 
peaceful ways out. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Would federation be a way out? 
  [Al-'Attas] Federation or other forms which may be better 
than that. What is important is finding a political way out. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What do you mean by other forms? 
  [Al-'Attas] I do not wish to be specific right now.
