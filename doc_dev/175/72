  [Text] House of representatives delegations left Sanaa 
this morning for visits to fraternal Arab states. 
  A delegation led by brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab, member of 
the 
House Speakership Council, and includes brothers Ahmad Muhammad 
Sufan, Mansur Ahmad Sayf, and 'Abdallah al-Mukaybili travelled 
to the Arab Maghreb. 
  Another delegation, led by brother Yahya Mansur Abu-Isba', 
chairman of the Public Liberties and Human Rights Committee in 
the House, and including Deputies brothers Dr. 'Abdallah 'Ali 
al-Maqalih and Mahdi Abu-Bakr al-Hamid, headed for Egypt, Libya, 
Sudan, and Djibouti. A third delegation left for Syria and 
Lebanon. It is led by Deputy brother Sultan al-Barakani and 
includes brothers 'Abbas 'Ali al-Mu'ayyad and Ahmad al-Hayyan. 
A fourth team left for Iraq and Jordan. It is headed by 
brother Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kidsi and includes brothers 
Muhammad Naji 'Allaw and 'Abduh Muhammad al-Kanabi. 
  The delegations are going abroad to supplement Yemeni 
diplomacy and convey a true picture of developments in Yemen to 
fraternal Arab parliaments, with a view to securing sustained 
support for Yemeni unity as a pan-Arab gain, as well as a 
national Yemeni achievement. The aim is also to make it clear 
that there are separatist elements out to impose secession by 
force of arms. 
  In a predeparture statement to the Yemeni News Agency, 
SABA', 
brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mahmud explained the mission assigned 
to the delegations sent out by the House to the Arab states. 
They are carrying messages from the brother speaker to his Arab 
counterparts spelling out our country's stance on current 
developments in Yemen and the dimensions of the anti-unity 
conspiracy. These contacts are necessitated by bonds of Arab 
brotherhood, since Yemeni unity is not an exclusively Yemeni 
concern, but a brick in the edifice of Arab unity. As such, 
Yemeni unity is as much an Arab concern as it is an affair 
relevant to Arab masses and states, he added. 
  Brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab said he hoped these delegations will 
accomplish their task.
