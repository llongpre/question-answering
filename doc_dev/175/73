  [Text] Sanaa, 24 Feb (INA) -- Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, 
Yemeni minister of planning and development and member of the 
General Committee of the General People's Congress [GPC], has 
denied reports that a new Yemeni coalition government will be 
formed soon without the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  In a statement published today by the Bahraini newspaper 
AL-AYYAM, Dr. al-Iryani said these reports are baseless, 
pointing out that the formation of a new Yemeni government is 
presently not a subject of discussion. 
  The paper disclosed that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih has invited his "deputy" 'Ali Nasir Muhammad [former 
president of South Yemen] to form a new Yemeni government to 
replace the government of Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the current 
Yemeni prime minister. 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, however, rejected 
the offer.
