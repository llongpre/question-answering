<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council member and YSP assistant secretary general, 
in Rabat, by 'Ali al-'Amudi; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-'Amudi] Your stay in 
London for medical treatment lasted more than one month. Later, 
it became evident that you were on a mission for the political 
leadership in Aden. Can you tell us about the nature of this 
mission, and did you contact the British Government during that 
period? 
  [Muhammad] We carried out our duty toward our people, who 
are 
being torn apart by this dirty war. The results of our efforts, 
whether with the British, the brothers, or the friends, were 
compatible with what we believe to be our duty. We held many 
meetings at the British Foreign Office, with the parliamentary 
blocs, and with influential political, cultural, and trade 
quarters. The world at large has come to realize the danger of 
what is taking place in Yemen. I believe that the trend is to 
tackle these dangers. We carried out this mission in 
coordination with the leadership, and I would like to reassure 
you that things are proceeding in a coordinated and well-planned 
manner. 
  [Al-'Amudi] Sukhoi-29 aircraft appeared for the first time 
in 
the skies of the northern side. What does this mean? Are we to 
witness a new escalation where the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
will bring into the battle its strategic bombers which, as yet, 
have not entered the battle? 
  [Muhammad] We have information about military aircraft Sanaa 
received through Iran. Some of these aircraft were destroyed in 
Ta'izz airport in an air strike by the aircraft of steadfast 
Aden. With respect to what the southern side has, weapons alone 
will not determine the course and outcome of the battle. What 
will decide the battle will be the position that defends honor, 
dignity, and property against those who decided that the south 
with its inhabitants, villages, and cities is up for grabs for 
the army of Sanaa and its most important tribes. 
  The war will be a protracted one. People will resist the 
invasion, using all means, including new weapons. In this case, 
these weapons will be authorized because they will be used in 
self-defense. 
  [Al-'Amudi] Yahya Mansur Abu-Usba' has said in Cairo that 
steps are being taken to form a provisional YSP command under 
Salih 'Abbad in Sanaa. What does the YSP assistant secretary 
general have to say to this? 
  [Muhammad] Only the YSP central bodies have such a right. 
The war will produce unexpected results on all levels. 
Therefore, it is premature to say anything now. Otherwise, the 
issue will be similar to the many appointments that the Sanaa 
regime announces. 
  I met brother Yahya Abu-Usba' in Cairo. He told me things 
that are very different from what the press reports. [passage 
omitted]
