  [Text] AL-DUSTUR has contacted Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani 
in Sanaa. Al-Iryani is the minister of development and planning 
and a former foreign minister. He is also close to Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and is sometimes called the 
engineer of Yemeni policy. 
  During our telephone conversation, al-Iryani said that a 
decision to enter the city of Aden by force, following the 
two-week siege, would be a political and not a military 
question. There are 400,000 citizens in Aden and the leadership 
does not want to risk their lives. 
  Asked about the failure of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 
proclaimed on 21 May, to secure recognition, even from countries 
that do not have any political weight -- which could have been a 
victory for it that would open the door to further recognition 
-- al-Iryani said there is no alternative to reversing the 
secession. He said he expects the secessionists to go. 
  On the current moves, namely, the request made by Egypt, the 
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain, 
to hold an urgent session of the Security Council to discuss the 
situation in Yemen, al-Iryani said: The Security Council member 
states have asserted to our mission in New York that they adhere 
to Yemen's unity and democracy and respect its sovereignty and 
independence. Any resolution adopted by the Council that 
contradicts this reality will be rejected. 
  On the meeting scheduled to be held by the foreign ministers 
of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Saudi Arabia during the 
coming hours, al-Iryani said he had no comment, however, if this 
meeting aims at interfering in Yemen's domestic affairs, then it 
will be a serious precedent. 
  Regarding a statement issued by the Political Bureau of the 
Socialist Party, carried by Aden radio yesterday, denying 
al-Iryani's statements to the media about a secret dialogue 
going on between those al-Iryani described as the unionists 
within the Socialist Party and the leadership in Sanaa, 
al-Iryani said: They are free to deny or confirm whatever they 
want. The important thing is that we have received a signal 
from a third party -- a senior Yemeni figure whom he declined to 
name -- according to which the brothers in Aden say verbatim: 
Let us first agree to a cease-fire and then everything is 
negotiable. This came in reply to previous messages. 
  Regarding accusations propagated by some Arab media in their 
comments on Yemen that the General People's Congress [GPC] and 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih himself, who is the GPC's 
secretary general, have sought to divide the ranks of the 
Socialist Party -- by trying to win over some of its influential 
leaders, such as Salim Salih Muhammad, the assistant secretary 
general of the Socialist Party and dismissed Presidential 
Council member who was appointed with the separatist state; and 
Haytham Qasim Tahir, member of the Political Bureau and the 
dismissed defense minister -- Dr. al-Iryani said he can prove 
that 'Ali Salim al-Bid is the one who proposed the question of 
merger. Al-Bid cannot deny this. 
  Al-Iryani added that the separatists cannot talk about the 
accord document when they talk about secession. Had the 
document been implemented, it would have enhanced unity because 
it was signed by all the political forces in Yemen. The first to 
spurn this document was the Socialist Party. Al-Iryani denied 
that Haytham Qasim Tahir, the former defense minister, was 
killed recently. 
  Dr. al-Iryani said all Yemenis, young and old, value 
Jordan's 
true fraternal position in support of the Yemeni people.
