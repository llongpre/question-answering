'Abdallah: "Socialist Party Fears `Somalization' of Yemen"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden -- The Yemeni situation yesterday 
became a race between political solutions and military 
deterioration in the north and the south of the country -- which 
really threatens a "Somalization," as military sources belonging 
to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] put it. 
  The new development at the political level was the 
announcement that the Council of Ministers will convene in Aden 
today for five days under the chairmanship of Prime Minister 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. Meanwhile the military situation 
continued to deteriorate in Abyan Governorate and in the 'Imran 
area, north of Sanaa, after 24 hours of cautious calm. The 
Council of Ministers meetings in Aden will be devoted to 
examining measures concerning the implementation of the Pledge 
and Accord Document signed by party leaders in Amman 20 February. 
  However, a prominent minister belonging to the General 
People's Congress [GPC], which is led by Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, pointed 
to the possibility that the GPC ministers will boycott the 
Council of Ministers meetings in Aden. 
  Al-'Attas said that the "call for the ministerial meeting in 
Aden came from the dialogue committee in its meeting on 24 
February in Sanaa, specifically from one of its members, namely 
'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anasi, secretary general of the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping and deputy prime minister, who headed the committee 
meeting at the which the call for convening the Council of 
Ministers in Aden was announced." 
  The Yemeni prime minister told AL-HAYAH that "the 
deteriorating conditions require that a schedule be drawn up to 
prepare the atmosphere and normalize political conditions, 
ensuring that this program coincides with the implementation of 
the Pledge and Accord Document and makes it possible to activate 
the various organizations." 
  Al-'Attas declined to "talk about the serious military 
deterioration some governorates are experiencing." He merely 
pointed out that "it is regrettable, and there is a military 
committee and a committee for dialogue among the political 
forces. Its task is to halt military operations, which pose a 
serious threat to the homeland's unity." 
  Despite the military quarters' repeated denial that there is 
any new fighting in Abyan or north of Sanaa, where the 5th 
Brigade belonging to former Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
is stationed, the Defense Ministry in Yemen insisted on 
confirming the military deterioration. 
  Aden sources said that the military situation in Abyan 
Governorate in the south and the area of Harf Sufyan, north of 
the capital, Sanaa, witnessed a serious development yesterday. 
And that military officials in the south stress that what is 
happening is "the start of Somalization, unless a quick solution 
is found." 
  The Defense Ministry statement in Aden yesterday pointed out 
that the "northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade, which is stationed in 
Abyan, has continued to deploy its personnel and various types 
of weapons, including rocket launchers and heavy artillery, 
toward the areas of al-Saylah, al-Bayda', Modiyah, Wadi Dufas, 
al-Dirjaj, and occupied Jabal Sarar, in addition to its 
large-scale deployment in Zanjibar, capital of the governorate." 
  The statement pointed to the existence of "movements and 
deployments north of Sanaa, as northern troops from Sanaa headed 
toward the 5th Brigade to help the forces besieging the brigade 
belonging to 'Ali Nasir Muhammad." The statement confirmed that 
"the 5th Brigade's commander, Colonel 'Abdallah al-Shalil, 
managed to withdraw to al-Jawf area with the help of the Bakil 
tribes." [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH Col. al-Shalil, who was contacted 
from Aden yesterday, said that "the ferocious attacks he 
experienced were a war of annihilation against the 5th Brigade, 
which was subjected to a ferocious offensive using various types 
of weapons from Saturday evening until its withdrawal the day 
before yesterday." [passage omitted]
