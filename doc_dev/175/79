<F P=106> [Reports by Faysal Makram in Sanaa and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah </F>
in Aden: "Aden: Socialist Party Talks About Foiling Attempt To 
Shoot Down al-Bid's Plane"] 
  [Excerpts] Military sources in Aden have confirmed that 
the city's military intelligence (which is controlled by the 
Yemeni Socialist Party) [YSP] recently "uncovered a plot to 
shoot down the civilian aircraft scheduled to take Presidential 
Council Vice Chairman and YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid and his party's delegation from Aden to Amman in the next 
few days to sign the Pledge and Accord Document." 
  They accused some central security elements attached to the 
northern governorates and working at the Radfan Camp overlooking 
Aden airport of preparing to carry out the mission of attacking 
al-Bid's plane with "shoulder-fired RPG shells" when it takes 
off from the airport. 
  They said that "Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Suyayli, 
governor of Aden and member of the YSP Political Bureau, ordered 
the expulsion of the northern members of central security from 
Aden to the north and the arrest of those who were planning to 
carry out the attack on al-Bid's aircraft." 
  Furthermore, military sources in Aden say that "the forces 
deployed in al-'Anad camp (80 km north of Aden) arrested two 
Iraqis in the evening of the day before yesterday as they tried 
to infiltrate the camp, which has a military airfield and some 
installations." They added that "The Iraqis, who came from the 
northern governorates, confessed that their mission was to 
damage a number of military aircraft belonging to the army in 
the south and to hijack two planes to Iraq." 
  These developments coincided with the republic decree issued 
by Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih revoking Prime Minister and YSP Political Bureau 
Member Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas's decision the day 
before yesterday appointing Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad governor of the 
southern governorate of Abyan in succession to Colonel Yahya 
al-Ra'i, who was elected member of the House of Representatives. 
[passage omitted] 
  The General Committee (Political Bureau) of the General 
People's Congress [GPC] issued a press statement yesterday 
citing an official source as saying that "At a time when our 
masses and all the sincere people who care about unity and 
democracy were looking forward to 10 Ramadan [20 February] for 
the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document to end the 
country's plight resulting from the political crisis, our people 
were surprised by the report carried on Yemeni television's 
channel two about the divisive decision signed by Prime Minister 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas appointing Brother Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad 
as governor of Abyan, ignoring the constitution and the local 
administration law. That decision runs contrary to the 
principle of the state of law and order and undermines the 
homeland's higher interests." It appealed to all the political 
forces to "condemn that attitude" which it described as being "a 
violation of the Constitution and the law with negative and 
dangerous consequences harmful to the homeland's stability and 
democracy." [passage omitted]
