  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, has issued a republican 
decree under Law No. 1 for 1994, declaring a general amnesty. 
The following is the text of the decree: 
  The chairman of the Presidential Council, taking cognizance 
of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen and out of faith in 
the efficiency of the democratic process to bolster the 
victories of the Yemeni revolution; as an embodiment of the 
genuine spirit of tolerance existing in the mind and conscience 
of our people; out of absolute commitment to the duty of 
preserving the unity of the homeland and the cohesion of the 
Yemeni society in the various parts of the Republic of Yemen; 
out of concern that all the sons of the Yemeni people will 
participate in the march of national construction and contain 
the regrettable repercussions of the internal sedition caused by 
the rebellion of criminal secessionist elements against the 
constitutional legitimacy and the subsequent explosion of the 
military situation and the direct threat posed to the unity of 
the homeland and the security and stability of citizens; in view 
of all this and due to the requirements of the supreme national 
interest; and following the approval of the Council of Ministers 
and Presidential Council, decrees the following: 
  Article 1: With the exception of the secessionist elements 
whose names are given in the arrest warrant issued by the public 
prosecutor of the republic on 23 May, a general amnesty shall be 
granted to all the civilian and military men who, under the 
hegemony of the criminal secessionist clique, acted or behaved 
in a manner conflicting with the Constitution and punishable 
under the law. According to this decree, they will enjoy their 
full political and civilian rights and will continue to assume 
their responsibilities in the various places of work and 
production under commitment to constitutional legitimacy. 
  Article 2: Everyone who abides by the constitutional 
legitimacy shall benefit from this amnesty. 
  Article 3: This decree shall be valid as of the date of its 
issuance and shall be published in the official gazette. 
  Issued at the Republic's Presidency in Sanaa on 12 Dhu 
al-Hijjah 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 23 May 1994.
