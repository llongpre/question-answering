<F P=106> [News conference by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the </F>
Council of Ministers in South Yemen, with unidentified 
correspondents after Muhammad's meeting with Prime Minister 
Rafiq al-Hariri in Beirut on 24 June--recorded] 
  [Text] [Muhammad] I discussed with his excellency the prime 
minister the latest developments in the current fighting in 
Yemen, and the importance of a serious Arab effort to stop the 
current fighting by recognizing the existing situation in Yemen 
and the existence of two regimes and states. We have been 
unable to establish a true merger during four years of unity. 
We asked Lebanon--government, president, and people--to support 
the justness of our cause. We are defending our right to live 
and the right of our children to stop this destructive war, 
which has entered its eighth week. All types of weapons are 
being used in this war. Sanaa is sending thousands of people 
into this battle to occupy Aden and the south. It is trying to 
impose its will by force and is disregarding domestic and 
foreign will through its military action and option. 
  [Correspondent] Have you made any specific requests to the 
prime minister? 
  [Muhammad] We are asking our Arab brothers and Lebanon for 
their assistance, particularly political, to end the current 
fighting and to recognize Democratic Yemen. 
  [Correspondent] Is there any hope for a cease-fire soon? 
  [Muhammad] We hope so. We pin our hopes on Arab and 
international efforts, particularly on what will take place at 
the UN Security Council in the next two days. We hope the 
results will satisfy the parties and end the bloodshed and 
destructive war. 
  [Correspondent] Will you tour other Arab states? 
  [Muhammad] There are other delegations undertaking the same 
mission both on Arab and international levels. We will also 
make a tour of some Arab areas in the future.
