<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "'Ali Nasir Tells AL-HAYAH: Two </F>
'Ali's Should Go If They Fail To Solve Problems"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Former Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad has urged President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid to "leave" power "if they fail to 
solve the problems." He pointed out that the solution to the 
problem lies in the implementation of the Pledge and Accord 
Document signed in Amman, which "stipulated the establishment of 
a federation between the two parts of Yemen." He also warned of 
the possible partition of Yemen into "regions, not just two 
parts." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH 'Ali Nasir said that yesterday he 
phoned a number of Arab leaders and Yemenis "to contain the 
crisis and halt the political and military collapse taking 
place, and to return to the negotiating table and dialogue, 
because the alternative to dialogue is collapse and ruin." He 
denied he had made direct contacts with foreign leaders. "The 
contacts were made via Arab channels." However, he did not name 
the Arab or foreign leaders with whom he made contacts. 
  He said: "I cannot say that the fighting will lead to the 
collapse of unity. It is a wound in the body of national and 
Yemeni unity. It will take a long time for this wound to heal." 
He added: "If current developments turn into civil war, Yemen 
could turn into more than one state or an entity divided into 
regions." He stressed that he personally is "against infighting 
and separation. There is no future for Yemen except under 
unity. The leadership is the problem. Everyone is blaming unity 
for the problems, when unity has nothing to do with them. They 
talk in the name of the (Pledge and Accord) Document, unity, and 
the revolution, but their practices have nothing to do with 
these things or with democracy. Their actions are based on 
their narrow personal interests." 
  Concerning a way out of the current crisis, the former South 
Yemen president said: "I stress the need to conduct a dialogue 
and merge institutions. If they (Yemeni leaders) fail to solve 
the problem and extricate Yemen from the current crisis, it is 
better for them to depart and safeguard their history and the 
achievement they have made." 
  He noted that he contacted President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
the 
day before yesterday evening, but he could not speak to 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid because telephone lines to Aden are cut off. He 
also contacted Yasin Nu'man, chairman of the Socialist Party 
secretariat, and Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, Abyan governor and member 
of the Socialist Party Political Bureau, two days ago. 
  'Ali Nasir commended the U.S. position on the current 
crisis, 
saying the Americans "are for safeguarding unity and democracy. 
They urge modernizing the building of the state and stability in 
Yemen and the region, and I support this. If unity is in their 
interests, it is in our interests too." 
  He stressed the need to implement the Pledge and Accord 
Document. He said that "many of its stipulations still have not 
been implemented, even though it enjoyed a national, Arab, 
popular, and international consensus." On his opinion of the 
federation question as a solution and a way out of the current 
crisis, he said that the document stipulates "the establishment 
of a federation. But regrettably, it has not been implemented. 
Nor has the Constitution been applied or the document 
implemented. Its essence should be implemented. What I am 
interested in is to safeguard unity; the other things are 
details." 
  On the possibility of his return to Yemen he said that, "if 
this question is raised, I am willing to play any role to 
contribute to finding a way out of the crisis, but not for the 
sake of power or a post." He avoided "holding anyone 
responsible. Everyone is responsible. The issue is not who 
started it all, but, rather, the devastating effects we are 
experiencing."
