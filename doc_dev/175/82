<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F>
Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Abu-Husayn] Is your visit to Cairo in the context 
of the principle of reviving the mediation and ending the 
current war? 
  [Basindwah] I met with President Mubarak and handed him a 
written message from President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to reassure 
him about the country's security and safety. I told him that 
what is taking place in Yemen is a case of a mutiny and a coup 
against constitutional legitimacy and that the north never 
sought the military option but it was imposed on us by the 
mutiny command, namely the leader of the Socialist Party [YSP] 
who violated constitutional legitimacy, compelling us to 
confront this and to confront the coup attempt made by him and 
his colleagues with the aim of destroying the country's unity. 
All the Yemeni people are with us, and the mutineers will be 
defeated. We do not want the Yemeni people to continue to bleed 
and pay the price for the losses currently sustained in the 
country. The price must be paid by the YSP leadership. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What is 'Ali Salim al-Bid's position now? 
  [Basindwah] You should ask him, if you can contact him. I 
believe he is now trying to find a place to flee to abroad. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Would the Yemeni leadership deal with him? 
  [Basindwah] We cannot deal with him. He should face a fair 
trial because he dragged Yemen to this tragedy and he must pay 
the price. 
  [Abu-Husayn] But Aden accuses the legitimate leadership in 
Sanaa of declaring war in a speech on 27 April. 
  [Basindwah] The conflict is not between the north and the 
south. It is between the legitimate leadership headed by 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, with the people on his side, and 
the mutineers in the YSP leadership. 
  [Abu-Husayn] So, we have to ask you: How will the war end? 
  [Basindwah] There is no civil war at all. What is going on 
is an operation to repulse a rebel group. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Are we to understand that Sanaa is trying to 
enter Aden by resorting to the military option? 
  [Basindwah] That is not true. I am Yemen's foreign minister 
and I tell the truth which is the opposite of what the media is 
saying. We will never fight Aden. We are trying to end a 
mutiny. The mutineers will surrender and flee at any moment and 
calm and stability will be restored. The mutineering group must 
be brought to trial. Thy YSP's history provides evidence that 
it is bloodthirsty and its bloody practices have been going on 
for 30 years. So we certainly must take practical steps to 
settle the clashes, which means that the southern command should 
surrender the forces under its control. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Sanaa will today receive an Arab League 
delegation. What is the mission of that delegation? 
  [Basindwah] The Arab League delegation will not be visiting 
Sanaa for the purpose of mediation. An envoy of Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid was supposed to meet 
with Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih before the fighting 
to be briefed on developments. As regards mediation and other 
such matters, everyone knows Sanaa's position on the Arab 
League's meeting and its rejection of any mediation by the 
League or anyone else on the grounds that what is taking place 
in Yemen is an internal mutiny and coup attempt against the 
country's constitutional legitimacy.
