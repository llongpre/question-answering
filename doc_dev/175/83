  [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA) -- Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, 
former Yemeni prime minister and 'Ali Salim al-Bid's envoy, left 
Cairo this evening after a one-day visit to Egypt. 
  In a news conference held before he left, he paid tribute to 
President Husni Mubarak's efforts to end the fighting in Yemen. 
Mubarak's mediation is needed more now than ever before to save 
the Yemeni people from successive disasters, al-'Attas said. He 
stressed that the Yemeni people feel proud of and grateful to 
Egypt's president, government, and people. He praised the role 
played by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to restore 
peace in Yemen. 
  He said the recently formed government in Aden stresses its 
desire to stop the Yemeni war without any conditions and is 
willing for a direct dialogue with the northerners to find 
serious solutions to the crisis, ones that will take the 
interests of the people into consideration. The dialogue should 
be based on equality and frankness, and the north should not 
express any reservations about the participants, he said. 
  Al-'Attas blamed Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
the General People's Congress for aborting Yemeni unity. The 
dismissal of southern ministers and ambassadors means 
separation, and so does imposing unity by occupation, he said. 
  Al-'Attas accused Sanaa of going back on the Pledge and 
Accord Document, which he said "enjoyed the support of all the 
Yemeni people." He said President Salih declared war against 
the Yemeni nation, took away freedoms, and exceeded his 
constitutional powers when he declared emergency rule and 
unilaterally abrogated all the minutes that preceded the 
proclamation of unity between the two parts of Yemen. 
  He said the detention of a number of nationalists and the 
disappearance of known political leaders like 'Abd-al-Quddus 
al-Midwahi, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mu'min, 'Abd-al-Habib Salim, and 
'Ali Salih 'Ayyad strengthens the conviction that the authority 
in Sanaa is canceling its constitutional legitimacy. 
  Mr. al-'Attas said Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
decision to storm and loot homes of the leaders of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party and other parties and to use those leaders as 
human shields to protect his palace and his tribe from air raids 
indicates that his acts, including the war decision, were 
illegitimate. 
  He said Yemen today is being subjected to a crushing war 
imposed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the elements allied with 
him, with military and financial support from Iraq and Sudan, to 
implement a joint scheme that Aden is determined to confront and 
foil. 
  Asked about the possibility of restoring Yemeni unity if the 
battles stop, al-'Attas said in his news conference that such an 
action will not take the form of merger unity as in 1990. He 
explained that many issues need to be discussed before the 
restoration of unity, such as relations with Yemen and relations 
with Arab countries. 
  Asked about the international efforts being made to arrange 
a 
cease-fire in Yemen, al-'Attas said that during his recent visit 
to Washington he sensed a sincere international desire led by 
the United States and the Arab countries to end the fighting. 
He blessed these efforts and noted Egypt's decision in the 
early sixties not to go to war against Syria when the latter 
decided to secede from the United Arab Republic. 
  Al-'Attas ruled out the fall of Aden at the hands of the 
northern Yemeni forces. He stressed that Aden is a strong front 
that is difficult to occupy. If the aggression against Aden 
continues for long, he said, then "we will be compelled to 
request assistance from the fraternal countries." 
  Al-'Attas said that irrespective of the results of the 
current battle in Yemen, it cannot determine the future of the 
country. He admitted that the northern forces made some gains 
and occupied some regions, but he described the military 
statements issued by Sanaa as exaggerated. 
  He stressed that Sanaa supports extremists and 
fundamentalists to use them for political assassinations in 
Yemen. He pointed out that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has not yet 
signed a draft law on education because the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping, which is a religious party, is opposing it. 
  Al-'Attas explained that the recently proclaimed Democratic 
Republic of Yemen in the south was meant to stop the bloodshed 
and to prevent Yemen from disintegrating into many mini-states. 
He said the new state does not need de jure international 
recognition. He said the government of this republic pledges to 
work with all national forces to strengthen the foundations of 
security and stability and to hold municipal elections within 
one year. It also commits itself to implementing all provisions 
of the Pledge and Accord Document. 
  Al-'Attas said this republic is eager to establish strong 
relations with the Arabian Peninsula countries and with Egypt 
and Syria, and is now working to restore its right to membership 
in the Arab League, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the 
United Nations.
