  [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
today received a visiting south Yemen delegation led by Salim 
Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and 
assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party. 
Muhammad said that during the meeting they discussed 
implementation of Security Council Resolution 924 and Egypt's 
role, particularly before the crisis erupted and during the 
fighting, and all of President Mubarak's appeals and stances. 
  He noted that they also reviewed the efforts being made by 
Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, especially 
his meeting today with a south Yemen representative on the 
committee that will discuss a cease-fire. He said: We agreed 
on this proposal, which the representative of the UN secretary 
general has submitted and we are ready for this meeting. He 
noted that a delegation representing the other party is expected 
in Cairo from Sanaa. He said that the representative of the UN 
secretary general is exerting efforts to bring about a 
cease-fire, noting that this is the most urgent issue at 
present. He pointed out that if a cease-fire is reached, the 
discussion between the two parties will focus on forming a 
delegation to debate the other issues. He said that a meeting 
between the southern and northern delegations hinges on a 
cease-fire and Sanaa's compliance with Security Council 
Resolution 924. He said that Sanaa is trying to circumvent the 
issue and mark time. He said: We will turn to the Security 
Council to pass a new resolution deterring any party from 
violating Resolution 924, adding that right now this is what is 
required. Muhammad said that we will decide whether or not to 
go the Security Council in light of the contacts being made by 
UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. 
  Muhammad said that fierce fighting continues and is focusing 
on encircling the Aden Governorate, and on finding loopholes to 
make the public feel that Aden is coming under an offensive. He 
noted that courageous resistance is confronting the attackers 
and things are beginning to change, particularly in the 
governorates of Shabwah and Lahij. He said that popular 
resistance has begun in these governorates. He noted that Aden 
has a cause adding: We are a recognized entity and are facing 
an invasion and occupation and our homes are being destroyed. 
He said: We have a right to request aid to defend our lives 
and future. He pointed out that the countries that supply south 
Yemen with arms are countries that support right and respect 
neighborliness, peace, and stability in the region. He said 
that these are Arab and friendly countries. He stressed that 
the war will yield other results and that negotiations will 
determine the Yemeni future, noting that the future will not be 
the same as it was before the war. He emphasized that unity 
cannot be imposed by force, noting that when we established 
unity it was agreed upon voluntarily. He said that regrettably 
this unity was destroyed from within by forces that do not want 
unity and who believe that unity is blood and violating the 
rights of others. He said that a unity that is not based on 
sound and principled foundations cannot survive because rockets 
and guns have destroyed this fragile unity.
