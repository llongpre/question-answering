<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim by </F>
Claude Lorieux at the Yemeni Embassy in Paris; date not given: 
"`Aden Would Capitulate Without Foreign Aid'" -- all place 
names as published] 
  [Text] "The Aden rebels would not last a day if they 
stopped using innocent people as human shields and if foreign 
aid in the form of arms and money dried up," Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah of the Republic of Yemen (capital: 
Sanaa) told LE FIGARO. 
  On a visit to Paris, where he was supposed to meet with 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe yesterday, the Yemeni foreign 
minister made the following accusation: "The rebels are kept 
alive like a dying man on a life support system. The aid 
arrives in large quantities from Ukraine and other eastern 
European countries. The arms come from the black market. The 
Aden separatists do not buy them directly. Other people do it 
for them. I will not say who. I do not want to fall out with 
my neighbors. After flying over the province of al-Mahrah 
(which borders Oman and Saudi Arabia), the airplanes unload 
their hardware in Rayyan, near Mukalla (the eastern province of 
Hadramaout). Boats transport the arms and ammunition to Aden." 
  Although he has spent "half his life in South Yemen and the 
other half in North Yemen," Mr. Basindwah says he is "more 
attached to North Yemen," where he was often a minister before 
1990, the year of unification. Loyal to the unitary line of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the minister gets irritated when 
mention is made of the establishment of a "democratic Yemen" 
(capital: Aden). "I would prefer," he said, "to dig my grave 
with my own hands." 
  He jumps up when asked if the embassy in Paris, where he met 
with LE FIGARO, is the embassy of North Yemen or South Yemen, 
which are once again separated: "It is the embassy of the 
Republic of Yemen. There is only one state in Yemen, the other 
one (the Aden one) is illegal, and no capital has recognized it. 
Yemen was unified by referendum and elected a government in 
1993." 
  The minister, who visited London, the Hague, Bonn, and 
Copenhagen, and who is leaving Paris today for Moscow, stressed 
that the ministers with whom he met were generally "in favor of 
unity and democracy in Yemen." 
  Could one of the causes of the south's insurrection be the 
muscular conception which (northern) President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih has of democracy? "President Salih's party won the 
elections held in April 1993," retorted Mr. Basindwah. 
"Nevertheless, we insisted that the country be run by a 
coalition government. We chose this formula so that the country 
could get used to democracy. We need time. Do not forget that 
we live in a region where democracy is not liked." 
  No matter how much the envoy from Sanaa emphasizes that the 
current crisis "is not a fight between North and South, but 
between the majority of Yemenis and the renegades," the 
survivors will have a lot of trouble picking up the pieces of 
the shattered unity. The authorities have solutions to propose: 
"Each government (province) could benefit from very broad 
autonomy, while naturally ruling out functions such as defense 
and diplomacy." 
<H5>  `KGB and Stasi' </H5>
  This kind of development would apply both to the 12 
governorships of the North and the six governorships of the 
South. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is in effect rejecting 
any compromise which would give the South different treatment 
than the North. This means there is no question of a 
federation. "This kind of solution can be applied to different 
peoples in a single state, but not to Yemenis. We are a single 
people in terms of race, religion, and language," Mr. Basindwah 
stressed. 
  The conciliatory -- to say the least -- attitude of the 
monarchies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) toward the 
separatist regime in Aden clearly embarrasses Sanaa, which was 
formerly the capital of a conservative North Yemen pampered by 
Saudi Arabia. The minister explained his discretion in this 
matter: "My role is to heal the wounds, not make them worse." 
He did acknowledge, however, that "some of our neighbors would 
like Yemen to explode. They do not want a strong, unified 
Yemen." This is an example of a "short-term vision, because a 
strong, unified Yemen would bring greater peace and stability to 
the region." 
  "The oil wealth of the southern part of Yemen could be one 
reason for the crisis," the Sanaa foreign minister felt. "I 
think that certain leaders in the Yemeni Socialist Party 
(comprised primarily of southerners) were unable to resist the 
temptations, and that they received money from everywhere. It 
must not be forgotten that some were paid by the KBG and the 
Stasi." 
  Weakening -- not to mention crushing -- the South is likely 
to strengthen conservatism in the North, which is more tribal 
and more religious. Mr. Basindwah admits that "the existence 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party helped to maintain a balance 
between secular and traditionalist groups," before adding that 
"Muslim fundamentalism has not gained a lot of ground among the 
Yemeni people."
