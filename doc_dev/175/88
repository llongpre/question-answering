<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F>
Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq in Abu-Dhabi; date not given] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-Haqq] In view of the fact that you have 
rejected mediation in the current conflict, what message are you 
carrying for the Arab leaders on your current tour? 
  [Basindwah] Actually, the leaders in some Arab states have 
been influenced by hostile media. The evidence is that they 
view Yemen's unity in the same way as they viewed 
Egyptian-Syrian unity, and they fail to understand that Yemen is 
one country and one people, not two countries and two peoples. 
  Some Arab countries have also been making another mistake in 
that they describe the legitimate forces as the northern forces 
and the rebel forces as the southern forces, but the legitimate 
forces are forces from all over Yemen. The new defense minister 
comes from Abyan Governorate. 
  That is why I must explain to the Arab leaders the 
circumstances and how the fighting started, who started it, and 
how the political crisis in Yemen was a prelude to what is 
taking place now; and also explain that the crisis was 
fabricated in order to achieve peaceful secession, but when that 
failed the "mutineers against constitutional legitimacy" used 
the military card, hoping that Arab states and Arab forces would 
intervene and ask every side to return to its pre-unity 
positions. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] So, on your tour, you are not seeking any 
kind of Arab mediation and you do not want any intervention in 
the current conflict in Yemen. 
  [Basindwah] Arab mediation would be pointless in our 
situation because what is happening now is that the legitimate 
authority is confronting rebel elements. We do not reject any 
endeavor to bring about a cease-fire provided there is adherence 
to international legitimacy and the Constitution, and provided 
the rest of the armed forces return to the legitimate command of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  The other side is trying hard and desperately for a 
cease-fire because it knows that its end is near. Anyone who 
believes that what is happening in Yemen is a protracted civil 
war is mistaken. What is now taking place in Yemen is a combing 
operation. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] When the fighting started you said that the 
war would last two or three days. Over 10 days have passed and 
the war is still continuing. How do you explain that? 
  [Basindwah] We have actually discovered that while we were 
preoccupied with our own problems the "secessionist" elements 
were building fortifications in sensitive and important 
locations in the southern governorates in preparation for the 
implementation of their secessionist scheme. 
  Anyway, what has been achieved over the past 10 days 
confirms 
that there has been great progress and that the legitimate 
forces are getting very close to Aden. I believe that the media 
have reflected that in their reports and filming proving that 
the "legitimate forces" are not far from Aden, some being 20 km 
and some 40 km away. 
  As the commander of al-'Amaliqah forces said, these forces 
are waiting for the order to advance on Aden. 
  Ample proof that the "rebel" forces are on their way toward 
surrendering is the fact that their leader announced two days 
ago that he was prepared to abdicate power, which means that he 
is preparing to flee. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] Do you believe that the current fighting 
has eliminated any possibility of dialogue with the Socialist 
Party [YSP] leadership? 
  [Basindwah] I believe that there are some people in the YSP 
leadership and grass roots support unity, and we would welcome 
dialogue and cooperation with them provided they change their 
positions now before it is too late. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] By leadership I meant [Vice President] 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. 
  [Basindwah] Some leaderships are no longer acceptable, not 
even within the YSP. If it were not for the fact that the 
circumstances do not allow some of the party's leaders and grass 
roots to express their views, they would have taken frank and 
specific stands against the party's old leaderships. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle 
Eastern Affairs Robert Pelletreau [title as published] has 
stated that, in his view, the conflict cannot be settled by 
military means. Do you believe that statement reflects a U.S. 
stance regarding the Yemeni Government? 
  [Basindwah] Pelletreau himself said subsequently that when 
he made that statement he was expressing his own personal 
opinion, not that of the U.S. Administration. 
  When he said that the military solution was not the right 
solution and that there had to be a political solution, he meant 
that political victory required a political solution to 
consolidate it. 
  That is true. When we fight imperialism in any country and 
are triumphant against it, such victory must be crowned with a 
political solution. 
  My understanding of Pelletreau's statement is that he did 
not 
mean that the legitimate forces would not be able to score a 
military victory, but he was emphasizing the need for the 
military victory to be followed by a political solution. That 
stems from the American view of unity as they experienced it 
during the war between the northern and southern states. But I 
believe that the situation in Yemen is different. There are no 
southerners and northerners but only Yemenis divided by 
imperialism and the rule of the imams, Yemenis who can only be 
distinguished by having been born in one governorate or another. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] The eight-point proposal made by the YSP 
leadership has been received with Arab understanding. Is there 
any possibility on your part of accepting all or part of that 
proposal. 
  [Basindwah] People alien to Yemen who do not know the 
realities of Yemen may show understanding of the proposal. At 
any rate, some of these proposals are obsolete and no longer 
valid. I believe that the best thing the "mutiny leadership" 
could do is surrender to constitutional legitimacy to ensure 
that it gets a fair trial, because I do not believe that the 
Yemeni people would accept elements involved in the fighting, 
and there is no possibility of dealing with them. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] A cease-fire is a priority for all the Arab 
states making efforts to settle the conflict in Yemen. In what 
circumstances would you accept a cease-fire? 
  [Basindwah] We do not insist on a continuation of the 
shooting, but we will not agree to a cease-fire that would 
rehabilitate the "mutineering and renegade elements" or that 
would lead to the destruction of Yemeni unity. It must be 
understood that Yemeni unity is there to stay and no power can 
turn the wheel back. Yemen's unity goes on despite the 
suffering. Our people have a right to be united and to unite 
their homeland. I do not believe that this is too much to ask. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] It has been claimed that the Yemeni forces in 
the north have received military aid from abroad, particularly 
from Iraq, and that some elements have been captured. What is 
your reply to that? 
  [Basindwah] My reply to that is that a few days ago we 
received a memorandum from the Iraqi ambassador in Sanaa saying 
that Aden forces arrested some sailors of two tankers held at 
Aden since the Gulf crisis after the sanctions were imposed on 
Iraq. Of course, we could do nothing to release these people, 
who have been presented as Iraqi elements fighting alongside 
government forces. That is a fabricated story and is not the 
first story to be fabricated by the media of the "renegade" 
elements. They have claimed that there are some Sudanese too, 
but we challenge them to produce a single one of those. 
  Let me give you another example of the false claims made by 
the mutineers' media to win the sympathy of the Arab states. 
Three months ago, during the political crisis, I received a 
message from Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa asking me to 
work for the release of a number of Islamic Jihad members and 
hand them over to Egypt. He said that they were arrested in 
al-Marrakishah area in Abyan Governorate and that Aden's former 
governor, Salih Munsir al-Musayri, said that he was holding 
them. The Egyptian ambassador brought the message, whereupon I 
immediately asked brother Yahya al-Mutwakkil, the interior 
minister, to draft a clear memorandum to the former Aden 
governor asking him to hand these people over to Egypt. 
  The Yemeni consul [as published] indeed took the interior 
minister's memorandum to the former governor of Aden, only to 
discover that there were no such members of the said 
organization and that the aim of that fabricated story was to 
set Egypt against us. 
  I raised this matter during my recent meeting with President 
Husni Mubarak. That was confirmed in my presence by Ambassador 
Badr Hammam, the Egyptian assistant foreign minister, who 
verified that the entire story was false and that its aim was to 
drive a wedge between us and Egypt. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] You met in Damascus with [former South Yemen 
President] 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, and it has been claimed that you 
offered him a post in the Yemeni Government. 
  [Basindwah] That is not true. I did not offer him anything 
and I did not discuss any such topics with him at all. 
  I visited him in the company of brother Faruq al-Sahr', the 
Syrian foreign minister, and the reason was that he was in 
hospital. I had no offer to make and I had no authorization to 
make any offer.
