<F P=106> [Article by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Excerpt] Israel has informed the PLO that it has approved 
the return of 84 of the 104 members of the PLO Central Council 
[PCC]. The approved list of returnees includes Faruq Qaddumi, 
Mahmud 'Abbas, Sulayman al-Najjab, Jamal al-Surani, Taysir 
Khalid, 'Abdallah Hurani, Salim al-Za'nun, Ibrahim Bakr, 
al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Khalid al-Hasan, Dr. Walid Mustafa, 
Ibrahim Abu-'Ayyash, and others. 
  It is noteworthy that the Israeli list of approved returnees 
excludes Palestine National Council [PNC] Speaker Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Hamid al-Sa'ih. 
  Also excluded are Taysir Qub'ah, PNC and PCC deputy speaker, 
and Muhammad Subayh, PNC and PCC secretary. 
  Five of the PLO Executive Committee members, who are also 
PCC 
members, have also been excluded from the approved list. They 
are poet Mahmud Darwish (independent), Bishop Iliya Khuri 
(independent), 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh (representative of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, PFLP), Dr. Samir 
Ghawshah (representative of the Popular Struggle Front) and 'Ali 
Ishaq (representative of the Arab Liberation Front). 
  It is also worth noting that Bishop Iliya Khuri is a 
deportee, while poet Mahmud Darwish was a citizen in the 
Palestinian territory occupied in 1948, but he left in the early 
seventies to join the Palestinian revolution. 
  Also excluded from the list were Abu-'Ali Mustafa and Ahmad 
Fu'ad, PFLP representatives on the PCC; Saji Salamah and Salih 
Zaydan, representatives of the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine; Nasif 'Awwad, representative of the 
Arab Liberation Front; and Salih Ra'fat and 'Isam 'Abd-al-Latif, 
FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Federation Party] representatives. 
This is despite the fact that the names of FIDA 
representatives were mentioned in the Israeli authorities' 
recent lists of Palestinian officials. 
  The list also includes names of people who returned with 
earlier groups of deportees, including B'ir Zayt University 
President Dr. Hanna Nasir, 'Abd-al-Jawad Salih, Fa'iq Warrad, 
and Taysir 'Aruri. 
  AL-RA'Y has learned that the Palestinian leadership in Tunis 
has instructed its personnel to delay their return in order to 
arrange it in an adequate manner. [passage omitted]
