<F P=106> [Report on interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of </F>
the Presidential Council in the "Democratic Republic of Yemen," 
by Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo; date not given: "Salih Tells 
AL-HAYAH: We Will Resist the Fundamentalist State in Sanaa"] 
  [Text] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential 
Council of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" [DRY], has 
confirmed that the Cairo meetings which began the day before 
yesterday between Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary 
general, and delegations from north and south Yemen to find a 
mechanism for the promotion and consolidation of a cease-fire, 
have failed.. He attributed this to many reasons including the 
level of the northern delegation and the other side's insistence 
on fighting and failure to honor Security Council resolution 
924. Salim Salih, who is also the assistant secretary general 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], ruled out intervention by 
the Arab League to bring these talks under its supervision. 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Salih accused the Security 
Council of being slow. He praised the U.S. position because "it 
is balanced and views the issue as something which concerns not 
only Yemen but also the Gulf region and the entire Arabian 
Peninsula." He urged the Security Council and the international 
community to "pass deterrent resolutions against the Sanaa 
government," and he emphasized that "Democratic Yemen will on 
its own resist the threat of the fundamentalist state in Sanaa 
until the brothers and friends understand the situation." He 
pointed out that "the Sanaa government is at present carrying 
out imamite practices (reference to the imams reign) in the 
villages." 
  He spoke of the "existence of Egyptian and Arab recognition 
of Democratic Yemen and said that such recognition exists and is 
implied." 
  He expressed "pessimism" about the Brahimi initiative's 
chances of success. He said: "The composition of the northern 
delegation and the reports from Aden about the other side's 
movements and concentrations around Aden and its criticism of 
the Gulf states all reflect the Sanaa government's determination 
to escalate and not to comply with the cease-fire resolutions." 
He added that "the northern delegation has no authorization to 
order a cease-fire or consolidate a cease-fire. To them it is a 
question of circumventing these efforts and continuing to try to 
gain time in order to continue the war. The northern 
delegation's level of representation reflected Sanaa's lack of 
credibility as far as a positive response to UN resolution 924 
was concerned. It also showed that they were playing games with 
the fate and blood of the people, with no indication of a desire 
to spare blood or respond to the appeals for an end to the war." 
He added that "the composition of the delegation of Democratic 
Yemen under the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister and Planning 
Minister Muhsin Abu-Bakr Bin-Farid demonstrated our welcome and 
positive response to the international efforts and Lakhdar 
Brahimi's initiative." 
  Asked why were the Cairo meetings not held at Arab League 
headquarters and under Arab League auspices, Salim Salih said: 
"We are now working for the implementation of Security Council 
Resolution 924, disengagement of forces, and the start of 
negotiations. We welcomed Lakhdar Brahimi's initiative but the 
other side refuses to comply with that resolution and is still 
shelling Aden and sending military reinforcements from the north 
to the battlefields in defiance of the Arab and international 
will." 
  He accused the Security Council of "being slow" and added: 
"Developments in terms of the fighting make it necessary for 
the Security Council and the international community to act and 
adopt deterrent resolutions against the aggressor party, which 
continues to violate the cease-fire while the whole world looks 
on without appropriate reaction." He said: "What matters to us 
now is that immediate and practical measures should be taken to 
deter the occupation forces and the invaders and prevent the 
extermination of the citizens in the south." 
  He described the U.S. position as "balanced and interested 
in 
security and stability because it views what is taking place in 
Yemen as something which concerns not only Yemen but also the 
situation in the Gulf states and the entire Arabian Peninsula." 
He said that the U.S. government's warning to the Sanaa 
government regarding the shelling of Aden "reflects a political 
position." 
  Asked if during his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa the day before yesterday they discussed the question 
of Egyptian and Arab recognition of Democratic Yemen, he 
replied: "Egyptian and Arab recognition of Democratic Yemen 
exists and is implicit." He stressed that "the world now 
actually recognizes Democratic Yemen as an existing entity on 
the grounds that there was no progress at the level of the unity 
merger between the Yemeni Republic in the north and the DRY in 
the south." 
  He added: "At any rate, recognition is not the urgent issue 
now. What is required is a cease-fire and the preservation of 
what is left of Yemen after the attacks on economic, vital, and 
civilian establishments and the destruction of the country's 
resources." 
  On the turn the war has taken and the fact that some 
northern 
leaderships see this war as a "holy and religious" war, he 
affirmed that "the Arab brothers and friends should understand 
the danger of the mentality, dream, and ambition of controlling 
Yemen with a view to building a fundamentalist state." He 
warned that "the danger of such a state would be a threat not 
only to Yemen but also to all states in the Arab region." He 
also said: "Democratic Yemen is not facing an internal 
situation. There is a fundamentalist movement with clear trends 
and affiliations with certain parties who interfere in our 
affairs, especially Iran, Sudan, and Iraq." He added: "We had 
warned against that danger and now we are resisting it alone. 
The brothers and friends should understand that."
