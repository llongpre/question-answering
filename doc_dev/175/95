<F P=106> [Report by al-Sa'id al-Shatti from Damietta] </F>
  [Text] Security Department interrogations of the members of 
the terrorist organization led by Dr. 'Ali Hasan al-Day, 
ophthalmologist and chairman of the Damietta City Council, have 
revealed the existence of similar groups in many other 
governorates. These groups rely principally on the members of 
local councils affiliated with the Socialist Labor Party [SLP]. 
Some of the suspects have confessed, implicating their 
colleagues in other governorates. 
  The security departments will soon announce that they have 
uncovered new terrorist organizations in several governorates. 
  Dr. 'Ali al-Day said that as chairman of the City Council, 
he 
approved a Ramadan soccer tournament in the Ra's al-Barr sea 
resort at the request of Mustafa Subayhah, chairman of the City 
Council's Youth and Sports Committee. He denied that the team 
members were trained in karate or kung fu. 
  Investigations have shown that the chairman of the City 
Council, assisted by several SLP members, exploited the council 
and his own position to implement suspect plans and disseminate 
ideas calling for the regime's overthrow. 
  The suspects are: Dr. 'Ali Hasan al-Day, ophthalmologist and 
chairman of the City Council; Ashraf Zakariya 'Ubayd, deputy 
City Council chairman and decorator; Muhammad Muhammad al-Jundi, 
furniture dealer; Hasan al-Sayyid al-Mursi, optician; 
'Abd-al-Hadi al-Nahhas, freelance accountant; Hamdi 'Isa, 
agronomist; Husayn Husayn 'Ukashah, freelance accountant; 
al-Sa'id Muhammad Musa, decorator; Ahmad Gharib Abu-Diyal, 
vocational school student; Karim 'Abduh Shamsu, furniture maker; 
Jamal 'Abduh Shamsu, furniture maker; 'Adduh 'Ali Abu-Mahdi, 
carpenter; decorators Khamis Ibrahim and Muhammad Ibrahim; and 
furniture makers Ashraf Muhammad Basha, 'Abduh Abu-al-'Aynayn, 
and Mahmud al-Bih. 
  Mustafa al-Badawayhi, director of Damietta's Prosecution 
Office, remanded them for 15 days for interrogation on a charge 
of establishing an organization seeking to overthrow the 
government. 
  He also instructed that Damietta Public Attorney Counselor 
Ahmad al-'Izabi to supervise the arrest of the following eight 
further suspects: Mustafa Subayhah, City Council member; Wa'il 
Subayhah, secondary school student; Salamah al-'Iraqi; City 
Council member and furniture dealer; Salamah al-Bahawan, 
agronomist and City Council member; Muhammad Isma'il al-Rawdi, 
employee; Mahmud al-Sha'rawi, furniture maker; Ibrahim Durrah, 
decorator; and Ahmad Jaddu, decorator.
