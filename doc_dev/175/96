  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, today received brother Lakhdar 
Brahimi, personal envoy of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. During the meeting, the two sides discussed 
issues related to Lakhdar Ibrahimi's fact-finding mission in our 
country. 
  The president welcomed the UN secretary general's envoy. He 
reiterated our country's compliance with UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 924 on the situation in the Republic of Yemen, 
and its readiness to extend all possible support to guarantee 
the success of the mission of the UN secretary general's envoy. 
  The Presidential Council chairman also stressed that the 
forces of unity and legitimacy are fully abiding by the 
cease-fire, but the gang of rebellion and secession deliberately 
refuses to respond to and violates UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 924 in an attempt to internationalize the 
internal crisis in our country. He pointed out that the only 
thing that could prove the gang of rebellion and secession has 
responded to the resolution is for it to stop firing artillery 
shells at the positions of our Armed Forces at the entrances of 
the city of Aden, and pledge not to use what remains of the 
warplanes this secessionist gang has used to bombard the forces 
of unity and legitimacy along all axes. 
  The brother president said he has instructed our Armed 
Forces 
to observe a cease-fire as of 1800 [1500 GMT] today in 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 924, and to 
give a third chance to the rebellious and secessionist gang, 
hoping that this gang will not repeat its violations of the 
cease-fire, and will not continue its aggression against our 
Armed Forces. He emphasized that the forces of unity and 
legitimacy will fully and decisively comply with the cease-fire 
at all axes. 
  Brother Lakhdar Brahimi has expressed appreciation for the 
cooperation of the brother president and the officials in our 
country, for their care to make his mission a success, for 
complying with UN Security Council Resolution No. 924, and for 
doing all that will restore stability and security to Yemen. 
  Attending the meeting were Muhammad Salim Basindwah, 
minister 
of foreign affairs, and ambassador Muhammad Hadi, director of 
the Arab Department at the Foreign Ministry.
