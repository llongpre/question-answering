  [Excerpts] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni 
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, has praised the distinguished Jordanian 
role aimed at reaching an appropriate formula to implement the 
Yemeni accord document which was signed in Amman last February. 
[passage omitted] 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR before leaving Amman 
yesterday, Salim Salih Muhammad said: We were informed that a 
high-level Jordanian political delegation has been formed and 
will be led by al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the Royal 
Court. The delegation is expected to leave for Yemen within the 
next few days to meet with the Yemeni leadership within the 
framework of the Jordanian role aimed at upgrading political 
dialogue. [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on recent reports that Saudi forces had entered 
Yemeni territories in the Sa'dah Governorate, Muhammad said that 
this did occur and that joint committees were formed to discuss 
bilateral border issues. This is in addition to a message which 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih sent to King Fahd. He noted that 
all efforts are focused on solving these border problems as soon 
as possible. 
  On the Iranian role to solve the crisis, Muhammad said: The 
Iranian president last week received Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Basindwah. We consider Iran a fraternal Islamic 
country and our relations with it are based on equality, mutual 
respect, and joint interests. According to Iranian 
confirmations, Iran is not biased toward any party in the Yemeni 
crisis. [passage omitted] 
  The member of the Yemeni Presidential Council explained: 
Yemen has a huge amount of weapons. This negates reports that 
some Yemeni parties are receiving weapons from outside. In this 
regard, he referred to the Yemeni interior minister's statement 
the day before yesterday that there are 50 million weapon pieces 
in Yemen; that is, four for every person. The member of the 
Presidential Council considered this a modest figure compared 
with the actual number of weapons in the hands of the Yemeni 
people. [passage omitted]
