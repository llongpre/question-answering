[YSP], led by Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has welcomed the

  In press statements tonight, Salim Salih Muhammad, member of 
the Yemeni Presidential Council and YSP assistant secretary 
general, said his party reaffirms its full support for all 
sincere efforts exerted, and resolutions taken, by the political
