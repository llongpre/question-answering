<LEADPARA>  John Bardeen, a co-inventor of the transistor that led to modern electronics
and twice a winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, died Wednesday at Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 82.;    Bardeen, a professor emeritus
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, was a patient at the
hospital when he suffered a heart attack, said Larry Bernard, a university
spokesman.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A soft-spoken theoretical physicist, Bardeen was working with two other
scientists, Walter Brattain and William P. Shockley, at Bell Laboratories in
Murray Hill, N.J., when they developed the first semiconductor transistor in
1947.;    The invention was announced in June 1948, and its first commercial
use was in telephone-switching equipment four years later.;    Invention of
the transistor earned the three men a Nobel Prize in 1956 and transformed
science and industry. The tiny devices on silicon chips pushed aside the
large, inefficient vacuum tubes for portable radios, computers and the
miniaturized electronics required for space flight.;    Bardeen once remarked,
"I knew the transistor was important, but I never foresaw the revolution in
electronics it would bring.";    Bardeen was the last surviving member of the
team responsible for the invention. Brattain died in 1987, and Shockley, in
1989.;    In 1951, Bardeen joined the University of Illinois faculty and soon
began the research that made him the first person to receive two Nobel Prizes
in the same field. His development of a theory of low-temperature
superconductivity, in which electricity travels with little or no resistance,
helped researchers develop technologies for magnetic imaging systems for
medical diagnosis and made it possible to devise alloys that become
superconducting at less extreme temperatures. He considered the
superconductivity theory his greatest scientific achievement.;   
"Superconductivity was more difficult to solve, and it required some radically
new concepts," he said.;    His work on superconductivity was done with two
graduate students, Leon Cooper, now at Brown University, and J. Robert
Schrieffer, now at the University of California, Santa Barbara. They shared
the Nobel Prize in physics in 1972.;    The morning the second prize was
announced, Bardeen almost missed a champagne celebration in his honor because
of a misbehaving spinoff of his first prize-winning invention. He was unable
to get his electronically controlled garage door to open.;    Bardeen was born
May 23, 1908, in Madison, Wis., the son of a dean of the medical school at the
University of Wisconsin. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in
electrical engineering at the university and, after working three years as a
geophysicist at Gulf Research Laboratories in Pittsburgh, earned a doctorate
in mathematical physics at Princeton University in 1936.;    Later he held a
fellowship at Harvard University, taught at the University of Minnesota and
was a physicist with the Naval Ordinance Laboratory during World War II. After
the war, he joined Bell Laboratories as a researcher. From 1951 until his
retirement in 1975, he was a professor of electrical engineering and physics
at the University of Illinois.;    Two years ago, Sony Corp. endowed a $3
million faculty position at Illinois in Bardeen's honor. Michael P. Schulhof,
vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said, "Sony's achievements, from
Japan's first transistor radio to the latest digital processors, owe a
significant debt to the scientific contributions of Professor Bardeen."  </TEXT>
