<F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper; from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The first international seminar on industrial 
property and business possibilities in Cuba has concluded in 
Havana with a positive discussion of experiences by experts and 
specialists from the 14 nations that gathered here. The debate 
was enhanced by topics as important as Latin American 
integration in industrial property [propiedad industrial] and 
what the subcontinent could do in light of the new challenges 
posed by the revamping of the international legal order, which 
is gaining strength. 
  Regarding the use of the patents cooperation agreement, 
which 
began (?in May) 1978 under the auspices of the Intellectual 
Property World Organization [Organizacion Mundial de Propiedad 
Intellectual], the participants discussed some of the advantages 
to the countries that adhere to it, including the right to 
defend claims on inventions in more than 60 countries and the 
extension of the time granted to applicants before entering the 
national phase; these advantages allow for further development 
of the invention, marketing, and facilitate a better financial 
condition in order to meet other expenditures. Here, one needs 
access to an extensive technological bibliography. Jesus 
Sanchez Lima, from the United States, has commented on the 
treaty and the North to South transfer of technology. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] I look at it from a perspective 
different from other participants in this field, many who 
primarily.... [pauses] regarding the lobbying by the (?First 
World) against the Third World. Though I believe in the patents 
system and think these limited monopolies granted to the 
inventors are the most effective way to stimulate inventions, I 
believe, nonetheless, there must be a limit to those monopolies. 
Those limits in many countries that are forced by economic 
reasons to join treaties like GATT and NAFTA may not yield the 
expected results. [end recording] 
  During the international seminar emphasis was also placed on 
the overlap between copyright or industrial property, which 
provide protection to artistic and literary works, and 
inventions and patent rights. There was a consensus to consider 
a possible legal system, at both the national and international 
levels and to establish the principle of a single right over 
goods and materials. In conclusion, here is the opinion of one 
of the Cuban experts who attended the meeting. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] It has challenged us 
to exercise our intelligence, and by that word I mean the 
intelligence of those who live in Cuba. It has made us think 
beyond what we are used to thinking and even open ourselves to 
the challenges our domestic policy of promoting foreign 
investments in certain sectors are posing. Matters we had not 
considered, including in our legislation, are discussed here as 
the problems other legislations have. They will not be problems 
for our laws, because we have been forewarned. In a general 
sense, the [word indistinct] is highly positive. [end recording] 
  This seminar also served to explore the future report that 
will contain the steps Cuba has been taking against legal 
regulations on industrial property and the expectations it 
offers Latin America by adjusting its laws.
