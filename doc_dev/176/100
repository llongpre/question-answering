As the darling of the Hong Kong telecommunications sector, Champion
Technology can do no wrong. Founded in 1987 by Mr Paul Kan, a computer
software engineer formerly employed by Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, and taken
public in August last year, Champion is a bet - so far one-way - on China's
future.
The company is already regarded by Hong Kong telecoms analysts as the purest
China telecommunications 'play' in the market. More than 90 per cent of the
company's HKDollars 298.6m (USDollars 38.5m) revenues accrue from the sale
of its multi-lingual Kantone radio paging systems to China. And the system
is reckoned to give Champion a three-year technological edge over US and
Japanese electronics giants Motorola and Matsushita.
Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong,
says: 'Champion is a concept stock. If you believe that the market in China
will open up to foreign investment - which I do - then Champion will be a
major beneficiary. It has the golden combination of contacts and expertise.'
Last week, Champion made an agreed Pounds 21.5m (Dollars 31.8m) bid for
Multitone, the UK inventor of the electronic pager. The acquisition should
bring much needed resources to developing Champion's business, especially on
the mainland.
'We have a lot of business in China,' says Mr Paul Kan, chairman and chief
executive. 'But we are constrained by people, resources and capacity. There
are not many paging companies around that we can buy. They invented the
pager and I'm the father of the Chinese language pager, so it's a natural
fit.'
Champion makes its money in China from selling, installing and maintaining
pager systems and pagers in cities. Under current regulations, it is unable
to own equity in a paging network, although in most locations it shares in
the revenue generated by the system.
Currently it has 15 systems on the mainland, with an aggregate pager
capacity of 300,000 units, of which only 60,000 have been supplied. By the
end of the century, it hopes to have installed 100 systems with a capacity
of 2m pagers.
Mr Kan is the first to admit his company is a high-risk investment. Of his
deals in China, he freely acknowledges that 'everything is not
well-defined', and that there is 'no proper regulatory framework'
underpinning his agreements with partners.
However, what gives analysts confidence in Champion is its two-fold secret
of success on the mainland. It has expertise and technology, which allows it
to market its pager. Most importantly, however, it has contacts, especially
with China's military and public security apparatus, which controls many of
the country's radio frequencies.
Mr Kan is reluctant to talk at length about his contacts with the People's
Liberation Army, (PLA), saying that in many countries the military is
involved in business. But when pressed he says: 'They are very
business-like; in fact they are just like ordinary businessmen. But their
companies are good to deal with because they have a lot of clout. They can
give quick decisions and help speed up procedures like import licenses.'
And his contacts go straight to the top or, at least, near to it. Mr Kan
last week presented a report to the Chinese government about how it should
liberalise its telecommunications market. He gave the report to none other
than Mr Wan Li, 77, a veteran Communist party leader and supporter of
economic liberalisation - and Mr Deng Xioaping's favourite bridge partner.
Champion's future in China would be assured if it could meet its ambitious
plans for the expansion of its pager network. However, the company has set
its sights much higher, and wants to be involved in the mainland's telephone
system as well.
This year it became the first foreign company to invest in a domestic
telephone network on the mainland. It has taken 40 per cent of a mobile
communications network in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, China's most
populous province with an estimated 110m population. In doing so, it
circumvented existing prohibitions against such investment by standing one
removed from day-to-day operation of the network.
Its partners in the deal - which will entail an investment by Champion of up
to USDollars 30m - are the local branch of the ministry of post and
telecommunications (MPT) and the PLA. In addition to capital, Champion has
provided technology and expertise to the joint venture, for which it will
receive 40 per cent of the profits. These could be large.
China has to date prohibited foreign investment in the operation of
telecommunications networks. It is for this reason that Mr Kan emphasises
his company will not operate the Chengdu mobile network - which he says
should be ready for testing by the end of this year - only design the system
and procure equipment for it.
However, pressure is building on Beijing to allowed foreign investment in
networks.
