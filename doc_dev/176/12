   By helping to invent the transistor,
William Shockley did as much to shape the modern world as Louis
Pasteur or Madame Curie, colleagues said. But he died with a
reputation tarnished by his controversial racial theories.
   Shockley, who shared the 1956 Nobel Prize for physics, died
Saturday of prostate cancer at his home on the campus of Stanford
University, the university said Sunday. He was 79.
   He was among the fathers of the electronic age but spent his
later years embroiled in controversy over his theory that
intelligence is genetically based, and that blacks as a group are
inferior to whites.
   ``I would say he would have to be compared to people who opened
up huge new areas, such as Pasteur or the Salk vaccine,'' said
Professor William E. Spicer, Shockley's friend and colleague for 33
years.
   ``But certainly the controversies he got into later in life made
it much more difficult for him to get recognition for his key
contribution,'' said Spicer, a professor of electrical engineering
at Stanford.
   Shockley shared the Nobel Prize with his colleagues from Bell
Laboratories, John Bardeen and the late Walter H. Brattain. He also
was professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford.
   The team's first device, developed during what they later called
a ``magic month'' during 1947, was an innovation that made vacuum
tubes obsolete and the electronic age possible. Most modern
devices, from airplanes to wristwatches to computers, contain the
technical descendants of Shockley's work.
   Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories, the company he founded
after leaving Bell labs in 1954, was instrumental in the birth of
Silicon Valley and the electronics industry. His former employees
later invented the integrated circuit and the microprocessor, the
building blocks of the computer age.
   ``It's a great loss for Stanford,'' said Joseph W. Goodman,
chairman of the school's electrical engineering department.
   Shockley ``has made the most important revolution in the 20th
century,'' Makoto Kikuchi, the executive technical adviser of Sony
Corp. who has known Shockely since 1960, said in an interview. ``He
had not imagined his invention would lead to such a rapid
revolution in electronics.,''
   Shockley's sparked campus demonstrations by claiming that
intellectually inferior blacks were producing children faster than
mentally superior whites. His genetic theories also prompted debate
over the use of IQ tests in schools and over why blacks failed to
score as well as whites. Most experts have blamed this outcome on
biased tests and other factors not related to genetics.
   Many of Shockley's scientific colleagues ridiculed his racial
theories and abandoned their association with him, claiming he had
passed beyond his field of expertise and was acting irresponsibly.
   In his later years, Shockley tried several times to befriend
blacks he came into contact with, Spicer said. ``I think he very
much would have liked to have found a black person who would be a
personal friend,'' he said.
   A 1980 article in The Atlanta Constitution comparing Shockley's
theories to Nazism drew a libel suit from Shockley, who sued the
newspaper for $1.25 million. A federal jury awarded him $1 in the
case, and the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986 turned down Shockley's
attempt to revive the lawsuit.
   Shockley's wife, Emmy, said he considered his research on
intelligence his most valuable work and that he continued to write
papers on the subject until a few days before his death.
   At the age of 68, he contributed his sperm to a sperm bank in
Southern California that founders said was designed to help pass on
the genetic makeup of ``geniuses.''
   Shockley, whose father was a mining engineer and whose
grandfather was a whaling captain, was born in London and grew up
in Palo Alto, near the campus where he died.
   He was one of the children tested in Louis Terman's classic
study of gifted children but failed to test high enough to advance
to the follow-up study. He was fond of pointing out that Terman
passed over two later Nobel Prize winners.
   Shockley received his Ph.D. in the then-esoteric field of
solid-state physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in 1932 and joined the staff of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co.'s Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., in 1936.
   After a year of working on vacuum tubes as replacements for
mechanical switches in telephone exchanges, Shockley resumed his
research on how electrons behaved with crystals. He met Brattain
through that work.
   World War II put a stop to the research. Shockley went to work
for the government, and did not return to Bell Labs until 1945,
about the time that Bardeen joined.
   With Shockley and Bardeen as theoreticians and Brattain as the
experimenter, the team resumed efforts to create a solid-state
device that would amplify electronic signals like the more
vulnerable, bulkier and power-hungry vacuum tubes of the day.
Research teams at MIT, General Electric, Purdue University and the
University of Pennsylvania also were in the race.
   On Dec. 23, 1947, the Bell Labs team conducted the first
successful demonstration of a crude transistor: a pair of metal
cat's whiskers, 2,000th of an inch apart, stuck into a slab of
germanium.
   Shockley is survived by his wife; three children from a previous
marriage, two sons, William and Richard, and a daughter Alison
Ianelli; and one granddaughter.
