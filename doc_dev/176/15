<TEXT>     He and Mr. Kennedy were part of a team of Stanford University researchers
who built the first linear electron accelerator more than 40 years ago.;  
That accelerator led to the development of X-ray equipment that today
irradiates cancerous tumors.;   It wasn't the only incongruous twist in the 76
years of William Robert Kennedy.;   As a Montana State College graduate
studying at the Illinois Institute of Technology, he had proposed to write a
thesis on "A Linear Electron Accelerator." School officials had planned to
allow Mr. Kennedy to try to put his theory into practice, said his daughter,
Kathleen Anderson, only to back down when a French physicist said it couldn't
be done.;   Later, as World War II approached and with his master's degree in
physics from Illinois Tech, he returned to his native Montana to teach Army
Air Corpsmen, hoping he could learn to fly for his country, too.;   Heeded
science's call;   His scientific skills were needed elsewhere, he was told, so
he headed to New York to work on radar development at Sperry Gyroscope.;   But
he refused to quit pursuing his pilot's license even after he crashed a plane
on Long Island. Years later he would become an aerobatic flier.;   Still, the
accelerator kept calling, and at Sperry, Mr. Kennedy linked up with William W.
Hansen, a Stanford physics professor who a decade earlier had invented a
microwave resonator he called the "rhumbatron" to generate radio waves at very
high frequencies. It eventually was used to develop the linear accelerator.;  
By 1946, Mr. Kennedy had come West with Hansen to Stanford to complete his
doctorate and to try to smash atoms. Hansen also enlisted Carlson, who was
working on his master's degree, and Stanley Kaisel, an electrical engineering
graduate student.;   Started in physics building;   They set up shop in the
basement of a physics building on campus. "Hansen was the brains," said
Kaisel, who later obtained his doctorate, helped set up the electronics
research laboratory at Stanford and today is a management consultant in
Portola Valley.;   Mr. Kennedy kept at his dissertation on "A Linear Electron
Accelerator" and Carlson began building the 3-foot-long, 3 1/2-inch-thick tube
that would become a first.;   The hull had to be machined to a high tolerance,
said Kaisel, and Hansen had grown up with precision tools. "He was an eclectic
kind of guy, as good in making things with his own hands as he was in the
theoretical.";   But he also was a "knob-twister," said Carlson, and the three
tried to keep him from fiddling.;   Although a proton accelerator with
positive charge was developed at the University of California, the Hansen
team's negatively charged electron accelerator won the race with competitors
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.;   "Hansen was our leader," said
Carlson, who went to work for Hughes after getting his degree and rose to the
presidency of one of its 15,000-employee divisions, "but Bill Kennedy was
really a first-rate guy with a tremendous brain.";   Edward Ginzton, who took
over the accelerator development after the death of the 39-year-old Hansen and
became one of the co-founders at Varian Associates, acknowledged Mr. Kennedy's
"successful demonstration of the principle of the accelerator" in his doctoral
thesis.;   Radiation therapy equipment is a byproduct of the accelerator, but
a direct line from the accelerator to a product is another matter. "The honest
answer to the question about the practical application of basic research is I
don't know," said Bill Kirk, assistant SLAC director, "but 100 years ago when
the same question was asked, that research led to the electromagnets and radio
and television.";   After he obtained his doctorate from Stanford in 1948, Mr.
Kennedy headed for UCLA and work on an atomic energy project, his daughter
said.;   Eventually he established his own company, Kennedy Industries, in
Banning, and for more than two decades produced a connector for printed
circuit boards in early computers.;   Mr. Kennedy closed his company in 1973
and moved to Idaho, where he resumed his passion for flying. A heart attack in
1973 slowed him down, his daughter said, but he refurbished a clipped-wing
Taylorcraft and did aerobatics in it whenever he could.; (box)Born: July 12,
