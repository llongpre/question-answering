   Chairman Akio Morita of Sony Corp. grew up in a
wealthy family surrounded by the best technology of the 1920s and
1930s: A Victor phonograph, a Westinghouse refrigerator and a Buick
sedan.
   He went to American movies. ``King Kong'' was a favorite.
   Today, his company not only sets a high standard for consumer
electronics around the world, it owns America's largest record
company and is buying a major Hollywood motion picture studio.
   Sony's plan to pay $3.4 billion to take over Columbia Pictures,
following its buyout of CBS Records in 1987, has some Americans
worried a Japanese company is taking over the popular cultural
heart of the country.
   But the friendly takeover is only the latest in decades of
international investment by a company that has proved its
sophistication in operating around the world.
   Morita helped found a tiny company in the basement of a
bombed-out department store in 1946 and its early attempts at an
electric rice cooker failed.
   Morita himself, trained as a physicist, struggled to paste
together paper hand-painted with magnetic material to use as tape
in Japan's first tape recorder. Postwar shortages made plastic
unavailable.
   But when in the 1950s Sony bought the rights to an American
invention called the transistor and used it in ways its originators
never imagined _ in radios _ the Sony reputation for innovation was
born.
   In the 1960s Sony transformed video tape recorders, also an
American invention, from huge machines run with vacuum tubes to
compact transistorized models that became the professional standard.
   When it adapted those machines for home use in the 1970s, it
helped create the VCR and the culture of ``couch potatoes,'' people
who don't have to leave the house for entertainment.
   In the 1980s Sony's Walkman became a symbol of self-absorbed
joggers, commuters and other yuppies. Today its superlight
camcorders help parents capture their children's first steps on
video and tiny Watchman VCRs let them watch movies on the run.
   Now, with its foray into music and movies, Sony may be putting
its stamp on America of the 1990s as well. But Sony says it wants
to keep the American style of the software it's buying.
   ``Globally, U.S. (entertainment) software is the most
influential,'' Morita said at a recent news conference. ``Columbia
Pictures and CBS Records will remain in the hands of American
management.''
   ``Our motto is global localization,'' he said, and industry
analysts say it's more than an empty slogan.
   Almost half of Sony's 78,900 employees are local people in its
27 overseas factories in places ranging from San Diego to Singapore
to Bridgend, England.
   Sixty-six percent of its sales are outside Japan, and so is much
of its production. Sony began manufacturing in the United States in
the 1970s, long before the recent wave of Japanese investment there.
   Almost all of the televisions Sony sells in the United States
are made locally and 20 percent of its San Diego production is for
export.
   Sony's Bridgend plant exports components all over Europe, and in
1987 won a British government award for exports.
   Industry analysts say Sony's style as well as its structure is
far more international than most Japanese companies. Considered an
upstart by old-line Japanese firms, Sony has an anti-hierarchical
and risk-taking style that sets it apart.
   Morita sets the tone. One of the few true founding entrepreneurs
still heading a major company in a country where most presidents
are merely employees, Morita hawked transistor radios to retailers
in New York and had to fight the image of poor-quality that ``made
in Japan'' meant at the time.
   He has a thick shock of white hair and speaks English with a
fluency few senior Japanese businessmen can boast. Morita, 68, is
blunt by Japanese standards, or even by American ones.
   His recent book, ``The Japan That Can Say `No,''' co-authored
with conservative politician Shintaro Ishihara, caused a stir in
Washington for the way it pulls no punches in the U.S.-Japan
economic debate. Morita has long warned that the United States must
revitalize its electronics industry by investing more in research
and development.
   Morita this year handed over daily management of Sony to its
president, Norio Ohga, an opera singer by training who was hired
because of his frank criticism of Sony's tape recorders when he was
a student in the 1950s.
   Ohga is expected to lead the company beyond its roots in
consumer electronics and into a diversified range of products from
software to industrial electronics.
   The company's sales jumped 38 percent to $16.3 billion in the
year ended March 31, and profits nearly doubled to $549 million.
After several hard years when its Betamax video system gradually
lost out to the VHS standard made by other companies, Sony is back
in full force, analysts say.
   Last year Sony spent more than $1 billion on research and
development, or about 7 percent of sales.
