<LEADPARA>  IF YOU'VE ever found yourself riding down a new highway and fiddling with the
radio trying to find a friendly radio station, you may be encouraged by a new
generation of smart audio and video equipment that can find your favorite
stations for you automatically.;    Panasonic is the first to use this
user-friendly system in its CQ-ID90 line of car radios. But other major
electronics manufacturers are expected to introduce their own smart products,
everything from home audio systems to VCRs and televisions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The one thing these products will have in common is ID Logic circuitry, a
couple of computer chips that enable the electronic gadget to do the work of
finding your favorite station for you.;    Pierre Schwob, a Swiss inventor,
developed ID logic after searching for a classical radio station while on a
long ride through unfamiliar territory.;    "The idea came to me while I was
driving in a strange city," Schwob said last week from his hotel room in New
York, en route to Hong Kong. "I was fumbling with my radio dial and trying to
negotiate a corner and I said, 'There must be a better way.' ";    Schwob
determined that the better way would include a pair of computer chips
programmed by call letters with hundreds of radio stations nationwide.;    The
stations are then sorted by geographical locations, and cataloged once again
by format.;    You don't have to know what the classical station is where you
are. All you have to do is punch in the "classical" button on the radio and
the chips take over.;    ID Logic was introduced last year for a pricey $700
for Panasonic's CQ-ID90 car radio.;    But the price has come down a lot since
then. Panasonic's latest version, the CQ-ID60, retails for $300. This radio,
to be introduced in March, includes a pull-out feature that enables you to
store the radio in your trunk or some other out-of-sight spot. Schwob says
future car radios with ID logic could cost under $200 each.;    ID Logic won't
stop with car radios.;    Schwob is talking to JVC and Mitsubishi, among other
manufacturers, about incorporating the computer circuitry in televisions and
VCRs. He says Schwob says travelers in unfamiliar hotel rooms might press the
"news" button on televisions rather than fumble around for the local cable
news station.;    Schwob also says ID Logic would be useful in VCRs for those
who still haven't quite gotten the hang of programming their decks.;    With
ID Logic, you could program the VCR to record HBO by pressing the "HBO"
button. He also says ID Logic would have value on some of the new "personal"
electronic products, such as a Sony Walkman and that eventually, ID Logic
might increase the cost of a VCR or TV set by only $15 to $20.  </TEXT>
