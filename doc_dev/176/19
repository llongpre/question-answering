  [Text] Rafael Alunan, secretary of the Department of 
Interior and Local Government [DILG], said earlier today that 
the strength of the New People's Army [NPA] continues to 
diminish. Based on the latest statistics, the NPA rebels number 
only 8,300. Alunan added that the Philippine National Police 
and DILG are now ready to head the counterinsurgency campaign in 
1995: 
  [Begin Alunan recording in English, in progress] ...with the 
peace process. The strength of the NPA, for example, has 
dropped from 25,000 in 1987 to just 8,350 by 1993, or one third 
of its strength. In terms of firearms holdings, in 1987 they 
had a total inventory of 15,500; today, it is down to 
approximately 7,600. [end recording]
