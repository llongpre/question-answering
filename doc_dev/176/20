   This news story can tell your age.
   You're 50 or older if these words move you to memories of
staring at a mahogany box and hearing:
   _ ``Tain't funny, McGee.''
   _ ``Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. North America and all the ships
at sea. Let's go to press!''
   _ ``The house lights are being dimmed. In a moment, the great
gold curtain will go up.''
   _ ``Hi-yoo, Silver, awaaaay!''
   That, of course, was radio _ radio in its primest time, the
1940s and 1950s, when cities would fall silent and a visitor
strolling the tree-lined streets of middle America, on a summer's
evening, could catch, without missing a beat, the 15-minute drama
of Amos 'n' Andy pouring out of living room windows. In the
Depression years, one-third of a nation tuned in.
   A nostalgia-bathed exhibit opening Friday at the Smithsonian
Institution's National Portrait Gallery recalls the pioneers of
radio and television and the programs that generations of Americans
tuned in on and grew up with.
   The show's curator is Amy Henderson, a historian of the 19th
century who got her doctorate in Jefferson studies. She is a baby
boomer, and, although she thinks she remembers ``The Shadow''
(``Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?''), her earliest
firm memories are of television's Kuklapolitans and of the men in
gas station attendants' uniforms who used to bring on Milton Berle.
   ``It is nostalgia to you,'' she told a visitor 10 years her
senior. ``But it's history to me.''
   Off and on for five years, Ms. Henderson scoured the closets of
broadcasters for artifacts. She put the show together with help
from New York's Museum of Broadcasting. It will run through Jan. 2.
   The exhibit's museological purpose is not to wallow but ``to
trace the impact of radio and television personalities on American
culture'' from the turn of the century to the Kennedy-Nixon debate.
The museum says the inventions of radio and television are about as
important as Columbus' landing in the New World.
   Visitors will watch televisions giving snippets of early
broadcasts, such as Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, paired up for
the first time to cover the 1956 political conventions. They stayed
together to serve up the news for many years. Their signoff _
``Good night, Chet.'' ``Good night, David.'' _ became a national
coda, recited in schoolyards.
   There's familiar stuff here. A boyish Brinkley drily comments,
in a 1956 snippet, that the delegates did not clear the aisles when
the chair asked them to clear the aisles. No doubt, he made the
same observation this summer, eight pairs of conventions later.
   Dave Garroway is there, too, at the first ``Today'' show, with
J. Fred Muggs, a chimpanzee who bit everyone. His palm upraised,
Garroway signs off again saying ``Peace.'' In 1952, television at 7
a.m. was a radical idea.
   The exhibit offers artifacts of broadcasting: a Kate Smith gown,
a Howdy Doody puppet, Rudy Vallee's megaphone, Sid Caesar's German
Professor costume, a bejeweled Liberace outfit, Garroway's bowtie.
It's a clip-on.
   Radio buffs get to see what they did not need to see _
photographs of those who widened their world. They get to see the
device that created an awful racket when Fibber McGee reached for
the door to the hall closet at 79 Wistful Vista, and millions of
Americans, at their radios, tensed. What made that noise of a
closetful of possessions falling atop Fibber was a chicken-wire
covered barrel, churned by a sound effects man.
   Fibber's wife, Molly, would respond, ``Tain't funny, McGee,''
and people everywhere chuckled because it was funny.
   As for those other catchlines of radio:
   _ ``Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. North America and all the ships
at sea.'' That was Walter Winchell, the inventor of the gossip
column, signing on for 15 minutes of frenzied chatter, his finger
clattering a telegraph key between items, and hot news introduced
with a barked ``Flash!'' Twenty million people tuned in.
   _ ``The house lights are being dimmed.'' That would be Milton
Cross, introducing the Metropolitan Opera to a nationwide audience,
most members of whom probably never would see the inside of an
opera house. His virtuoso performance, every Saturday afternoon for
45 seasons, demonstrated the democratization of culture that radio
made possible.
   _ ``Hi-yoo, Silver, awaaaay!'' With that fading call, the Lone
Ranger, who fought evil in the old West with silver bullets,
galloped off. He and his ever-faithful Indian companion, Tonto,
played on radio for 2,956 episodes, from Jan. 30, 1933, to Sept. 3,
1954. They lasted on television from 1949 until 1957.
   Many entertainers couldn't make the move to the new medium.
   Funnyman Fred Allen was one who flopped on television. ``On a
radio broadcast, anything goes,'' he told Life magazine. ``You can
have a man walking up the side of a building like a spider. You
merely plant a suggestion in the listener's mind and his
imagination supplies all the details, all the scenery, props,
extras and costumes.''
   But, as for television, said the acerbic Allen: ``They call
television a medium because nothing on it is ever well done.''
