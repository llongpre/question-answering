  [Text] Moscow-Kiev -- Speaking to a UNIAN correspondent 
today, Russia's Ambassador-at-Large Yuriy Dubinin, who is 
heading the Russian state delegation at the negotiations on the 
Black Sea Fleet, refuted a Radio Liberty report which quoted him 
as saying that Russia has no intention of taking an inventory of 
the Black Sea Fleet, as well as a report by the same radio 
station on "Ukraine's reluctance to abide by last year's 
Massandra accords." Yuriy Dubinin refused to give his opinion 
on the fleet's inventory insisted on by the Ukrainian side but 
stressed that the issue is within the competence of the 
Ukrainian and Russian delegations. "Any attempts to turn the 
Black Sea Fleet negotiations into a shoot-out by unilateral and 
public statements will have little effect," he said. 
"Undoubtedly, [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk's proposals 
on the fleet will be discussed. The final date for a meeting 
between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations has not yet been 
set." 
  Speaking on the Black Sea Fleet issue, Ukraine's former 
defense minister, Kostyantyn Morozov, told UNIAN today that the 
sides must first fulfill their previous obligations. "The fleet 
must be divided by 1995, and its non-Ukrainian part must leave 
the territory of Ukraine, in which Russia can count on our 
assistance," Kostyantyn Morozov stressed. "I am convinced it 
would be unreasonable to drag this problem into the next 
century." He also emphasized the lack of grounds behind 
Moscow's allegations that Ukraine is not abiding by the 
Massandra accords. "We don't know any such accords. The 
Russian side means the verbal agreements between Presidents 
Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin which are not accords as such 
but merely a reflection of their common view on the negotiation 
process." The main premise in this process, the former minister 
believes, should be Ukraine's legislation and security.
