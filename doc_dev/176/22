   The Army has decided to accelerate plans to
shield a key control unit in the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter against
radio wave interference after a test incident earlier this month in
Europe, a spokesman said Friday.
   The May 11 incident, in which a Blackhawk flying near a huge
antenna farm banked into a right-hand turn for five seconds without
any pilot commands, also has prompted the Army to instruct its
pilots to keep clear of a handful of radio antenna installations in
West Germany.
   Although the May 11 incident has raised new concerns about the
effects of so-called electromagnetic interference on the Blackhawk,
extensive testing has convinced the service it is still dealing
with a ``nuisance'' problem and not a phenomenon that affects
flight safety, said Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman.
   ``We certainly are not going to ground the fleet, because
there's no reason to do so,'' Soucy added.
   But Soucy said the Army intends to accelerate its plans to add
shielding to the electronic controls on the craft's hydraulic
control system because of the test results. The service already had
opened talks with the helicopter's manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft,
on shielding a number of electronic components ``because our pilots
shouldn't have to worry about nuisance'' signal interference, Soucy
said.
   Last November, Knight-Ridder Newspapers reported investigators
were convinced radio wave interference had caused five Blackhawk
accidents since 1982, killing 22 servicemen.
   ``Radio waves in the air can penetrate the helicopter's wiring
and electrical components and generate false commands that can
range from simply causing the craft's warning lights to flash to
sending it into a fatal dive,'' the report said.
   The Army and Sikorsky, a subsidiary of the United Technologies
Corp., adamantly disputed that report, saying there was no evidence
electromagnetic interference had caused any crashes.
   The service had acknowledged earlier that radio wave
interference could cause ``uncommanded control inputs,'' moving the
helicopter's horizontal stabilator slightly, but not to the extent
of posing a flight safety hazard. There is a switch in the cockpit
that allows a pilot to assume manual control of the stabilator, the
Army says.
   Last month, a Blackhawk operating near a large array of
high-intensity antennas in West Germany experienced some unusual
blinking lights and alarm horns, Soucy said. The Army then
attempted to replicate that incident with special instruments and
test pilots.
   On May 11, during a test, ``the aircraft turned to the right on
its own for about five seconds while flying near the antenna
farm,'' Soucy said. ``We believe the hydraulic logic module inside
the Blackhawk was being affected.''
   The spokesman declined to say how close the helicopter was
flying to the antenna farm, but said it was transmitting with a
combined power in excess of 400 million watts of power.
   While the test suggests that large levels of electromagnetic
interference actually can affect the controls of the Blackhawk,
``the effect is very brief'' and doesn't pose a threat of losing
control of the copter, Soucy said.
   The Blackhawk is a twin-engine, single-rotor helicopter that is
replacing the aging UH-1 Huey copters of the Vietnam era as the
Army's primary air assault and air cavalry craft. It was introduced
in April 1981.
   The Army currently has more than 900 Blackhawks in its inventory
and plans to buy about 1,700 of the choppers. Each craft costs
roughly $6 million.
