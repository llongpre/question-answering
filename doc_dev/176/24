<LEADPARA>  In an effort to resurrect waning interest in ham radio, the Federal
Communications Commission will no longer require a knowledge of the Morse code
for beginning operators.;    The rule change takes effect today.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FLASH! SOME MORSE CODE RULES DASHED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The FCC issues five classes of licenses to ham radio operators: novice,
technician, general, advanced and amateur extra.;    Only the technician-class
license will be available to those who cannot use the Morse code. The four
other classes still require some code proficiency.;    The novice class might
be more attractive for beginners who already know the Morse code because its
written exam is less extensive than the one required for technician class.;   
To keep operators interested in the hobby, the commission has an incentive
system linking each class of license to different ranges of radio frequencies.
As amateurs move up the license ladder, they gain access to better frequencies
and to more operators worldwide.;    Of the 450,000 amateur radio operators in
the United States, about 112,000 have technician-class licenses.;    Because
amateur operators function as emergency communicators, they are required to
know the Morse code by the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva,
the United Nations world broadcasting authority.;    But in practice, most
countries only partly abide by those rules. While some ham operators continue
to use the Morse code, most say voice and computer communications are quicker
and much more convenient.;    "Morse code is no longer an integral part of ham
radio service," said Luck Hurder, deputy manager of field services for the
American Radio Relay League, the largest ham radio association in the United
States.;    Many ham radio enthusiasts say that dropping the Morse code
requirement will make the hobby more accessible.;    The FCC is mandated under
the Radio Act of 1912 to get young people interested in amateur radio, because
it provides a base in electronics and engineering.;    But the United States
is one of a handful of countries that has enforced the International
Telecommunications Union's Morse code rule.;    When Japan dropped the
requirement several years ago, the average age of its amateur operators
dropped to the mid-20s. In the United States, the average age of ham operators
is 55.;    The Morse code, invented in 1835 by Samuel F.B. Morse, has been
used to transmit emergency messages, including the famous cry for help: SOS.; 
  But in 1988, the International Maritime Organization began a five-year
phasing out of the Morse code on ships, replacing it with a radio signal panic
button.  </TEXT>
