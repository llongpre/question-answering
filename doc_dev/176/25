   Emerson Radio Corp., citing continuing weakness in
consumer spending, said it expects to report a "substantial"
loss for its fiscal third quarter.
   The North Bergen, N.J., maker of consumer electronics
products also said it has hired Lehman Brothers, a unit of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., as financial adviser for
debt-restructuring talks with its lenders, and to review
financial alternatives for the company.

   Emerson said the anticipated loss will result from
additions to reserves and a "sizable" one-time charge for
expenses in reducing its inventory. No further details were
provided. It said nine-month losses also were expected to be
substantial.
   In the year-earlier third quarter, Emerson Radio earned
$4.5 million, or 13 cents a share, on sales of $229.9
million.
   Emerson also said it was changing its fiscal year to end
Dec. 31 from March 31, reflecting a decision taken by senior
management after their review of operations.
   Emerson designs and markets a full line of consumer
electronic products.
