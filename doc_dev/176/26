  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Three U.S. congressmen failed to 
land in Malanje today because of heavy shelling allegedly by 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. 
[passage omitted]. The UNITA delegation in Lisbon has denied 
the attack on Malanje. Carlos Fontoura [UNITA representative in 
Lisbon] says it has all been fabricated. 
  [Begin recording] [Fontoura] I have to deny categorically 
any 
UNITA action to that effect. [passage omitted]. It is obvious 
that the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] is 
beginning to show a blatant and evident lack of imagination. A 
few days ago -- when the visit by the Americans, the U.S. 
congressmen, was being planned -- the day before they invented 
and publicized a UNITA attack against Malongo, which as you know 
not even the American company confirmed. Now, the day the 
Congressmen were due to arrive the MPLA invents all this 
guerrilla activity, which is no way part of UNITA's objectives.
