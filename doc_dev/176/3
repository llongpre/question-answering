<LEADPARA>  Double the size of stores. Let other companies' brands onto the shelves. Put
lots of "impulse" items at the checkout register. Add kiosks with electronic
catalogs, so customers can go right to the video to see and print out
information about parts and products.;   Such are the seeds of a new Radio
Shack as the nation's most widespread retailer of electronics tries to end two
years of sliding sales and remake itself into a growth company with some
luster.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "They're trying to rejuvenate the chain," said Dennis Van Zelfden, an
analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas. "The chain suffers from a
lackluster image.";   The Fort Worth-based firm has begun to tinker with its
bread-and-butter recipe of selling only house-brand electronics in lots of
small stores. In a series of wide-ranging experiments that may increase in
frequency, the hunt is on to find an improved formula for an era where the
greatest sales growth is being achieved by superstores selling name-brand
electronics at cut-throat prices.;   "We're experimenting from a position of
strength, not weakness," said Radio Shack president Bernard S. Appel. "None of
this experimentation is a result of slowing sales.";   There is no question
that growth eludes Radio Shack.;   The size of the chain, built rapidly in the
'60s and '70s, has been static for years at slightly more than 7,000 stores.
More critically, its sales are shrinking. When the company breaks out Radio
Shack sales for the year ended June 30, they are likely to be slightly less
than $2.9 billion, down about 2 percent from last year and nearly 4 percent
from two years ago.;   But Radio Shack's need to "jump-start its business" is
no different than that of any other consumer electronics retailer, said Dean
Witter analyst Eugene Glazer.;   "Consumer electronics sales have been under
pressure; the consumer really has not been buying," Glazer said. "This is a
universal problem being faced by consumer electronics retailers.";   Out of
the four big publicly traded consumer electronics retailers, only two --
Circuit City Stores Inc. and Good Guys Inc. -- made money last year. The other
two, Best Buy Co. and Highland Superstores Inc., lost money.;   But even
though more than 50 million Americans shop at Radio Shack stores every year,
the retailer still fights an image that it is primarily a source of batteries,
electronic parts and accessories that can't be found elsewhere, analysts
said.;   "The bigger-ticket retail has eluded them," Glazer said.;   "I think
there is a certain customer who would never buy at Radio Shack: He who really
needs snob appeal to justify his purchase," said Liz Buyer, vice president at
Cowen &amp; Co., New York.;   "Radio Shack's brands have never achieved such snob
appeal.;   "I don't know anybody who ever said, 'Gee, I just bought an Optimus
stereo,' " said one Texas analyst.;   Yet Radio Shack's sales may have hit a
plateau because it continues to appeal the same customers it always has. Appel
acknowledges that Radio Shack's market research and experimentation have
focused on existing customers, rather than on electronics buyers who shop
elsewhere.;   Nonetheless, even if it has hit a plateau, Radio Shack is by far
the most profitable seller of consumer electronics. Appel likes to boast that
Radio Shack's profits are greater than all its competitors' combined. And he
may be right.;   Using house brands, such as Realistic, Optimus and Arrow,
means that customers can't easily compare prices with name-brand products,
such as Panasonic or Sony, sold by competitors. Plus Radio Shack often does
its own manufacturing and distribution, allowing the capturing of intermediate
margins along the way. When others make products for Radio Shack, the sheer
volume of its purchases helps drive down negotiated prices.;   As a result,
Radio Shack historically has recorded a gross profit margin, before overhead,
taxes and interest expenses, of more than 50 cents on the dollar for the
products it sells. By contrast, a competitor such as Circuit City is lucky to
record a gross profit of 30 cents on the dollar.;   "It's like a gold mine in
terms of the profits and cash flow it does generate for Tandy," said Van
Zelfden, referring to Radio Shack's parent company.;   But there is pressure
nonetheless to bring name brands into Radio Shack stores. Glazer points out
that if selling name brands produces higher turnover of inventory, Radio Shack
can still produce a greater return on its investment in electronics products.;
  There's plenty of room for improvement there. Radio Shack typically has
turned over its inventory three times a year, where Circuit City inventory
turns over six times a year, Best Buy seven times and Good Guys eight times.; 
 But Radio Shack is only gingerly testing the idea of putting name brands such
as Panasonic in its stores. The first experiment involves putting high-priced
audio products normally found at another retail chain run by Tandy Corp.,
VideoConcepts. The name-brand products will appear only in remote markets and
will not overlap in price with audio products sold under Radio Shack brands,
Appel said.;   Some name-brand products also are likely to show up near the
checkout counters of 750 Radio Shack stores. These will be "impulse" items,
such as wet-dry shavers or leather carrying cases with calculators, that will
be unadvertised, relying solely on foot traffic to spur sales.;   There's even
the possibility of a massive change in the size of Radio Shack stores
themselves. Traditionally, Radio Shack has tried to be the convenience store
of consumer electronics, fitting into 2,400-square-foot pockets at malls and
shopping centers everywhere.;   In the past, that earned the stores
reputations for being cramped and cluttered, particularly when they appealed
largely to electronics buffs who "liked the clutter. They were comfortable
with it," recalls Chris Chilton, a Radio Shack manager before the company
began its recent push to remake its outlets into stylish "technology stores.";
  Now the Tandy Corp. division will try out spacious "super-Shack" stores that
span 5,000 square feet. A three-store test will let Radio Shack stores not
just line their walls with products but set up enclaves that show off how to
automate the control of electronic appliances throughout a home, for instance.  </TEXT>
