Paul Eisler, who died last week aged 85, was a prolific inventor whose major
technological innovation - the printed circuit - accelerated the development
of modern electronics. That he amassed neither great wealth nor fame as a
consequence of his ingenuity seems to have been a product both of his times
and of his somewhat nave and remote personality.
Financial reward was rarely at the forefront of his thoughts; he thought of
printed circuits primarily as his contribution to Britain's war effort. A
Viennese Jew, Eisler left Austria in 1936 ahead of the rising Nazi tide and
settled in England where he was to remain for the rest of his life.
His career, while busy and eventful, was also dogged by disappointment and
rejection although he betrayed few signs of bitterness in his 1989
autobiography.
Eisler's genius was both theoretical and practical; not only did he see that
the tangled mass of wires which characterised electrical circuits in the
first half of the century could be replaced by metallic tracks bonded to an
insulating layer, his experience in printing technology led him to develop a
manufacturing method, foil etching, which is still in use today. His work
led to miniaturisation, to the integrated circuit or silicon chip and, most
important, to the low-cost mass production of electronic circuitry.
He remembers showing a radio he constructed using one of the first printed
circuits to Plessey in 1936. The company rejected it on the grounds that it
would replace women on the production line.
Eisler reserved his animosity for bureaucrats who got in the way of
invention, harbouring special disgust for the National Research Development
Corporation, founded by the Labour government in 1949 to commercialise the
products of publicly funded research.
'The treatment which my inventions received from the NRDC has made me wonder
again and again why this organisation has been so grossly inefficient in
doing the job for which Parliament had created it,' he wrote, concluding
that political games sapped the energies of its officers so they could not
deal sensibly with inventors and inventions.
