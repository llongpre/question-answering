Noble Broadcast Group's $200-million bid for two radio networks, a deal that 
would have put the San Diego-based radio chain in the front rank in number of 
U. S. listeners, has been turned down, Noble chairman John Lynch said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Noble said the offer for New York-based United Stations and 
Colorado Springs-based Transtar is still on the table and he is optimistic that 
his company and the networks will come to an agreement "down the road." The 
deal has been in negotiations for three months and has been followed widely in 
the broadcast industry. 
</P>
<P>
United Stations President Nick Verbitsky acknowledged the offer Wednesday, 
saying only that "we talk to a lot of people, and we get offers all the time." 
Verbitsky, who with Dick Clark is a principal shareholder of United, said "your 
guess is as good as mine" when asked the chances of striking a deal with Noble. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing Noble owns 18 radio stations, including XTRA-FM and AM in San 
Diego, up from two stations four years ago. To raise equity capital for the 
purchase of the networks, Nobel last month sold two Boston stations, WSSH-AM 
and FM, to a group led by entertainer Merv Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said Noble's long-term goal is to own a major radio network in order to 
better exercise control over Noble's "inventory," or programming, and Noble 
will continue to look for suitable network acquisitions. Noble also plans to 
acquire more stations over the next year or two to reach the maximum 24 
stations allowed by the Federal Communications Commission, Lynch said.

31 Weekly Programs 
</P>
<P>
Closely held United Stations bought the RKO radio network in April 1985 and 
also owns a programming production company, Verbitsky said. The network 
produces about 31 weekly programs, including Dick Clark's weekly Top 40 
countdown show, that are sold to 1,200 affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
Transtar sells eight 24-hour radio formats, ranging from Top 40 and Golden 
Oldies to country-western and big band, which are fed to 1,400 affiliate 
stations via satellite. Transtar also produces a rock-'n'-roll countdown show 
featuring comedian John Candy and owns a radio market-research firm.

Transtar principals C. T. Robinson and Bill Moyes were unavailable for comment 
Wednesday.
