   NEW YORK -- General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit said it is in preliminary talks with "a limited number of companies" to sell its entire radio group, the business on which NBC was founded. 

   The sale of NBC's radio group would take it out of a business it has been in since the company's formation in 1926. 
The sale would be a switch of strategy for NBC, which had first said it would "reconfigure" its radio business by selling some stations and purchasing others. 

   NBC's radio group includes a total of eight stations. 
The company soon will close on the previously announced $13 million sale of WMAQ-AM in Chicago. 
Currently, NBC is in separate talks with a potential buyer about the sale of WKYS-FM in Washington, said Randall D. Bongarten, president of NBC's radio division. 
Consultants say that station is NBC's single most profitable station. 

   But NBC, acquired with its parent RCA Corp. by General Electric in 1986, had been expected to hold onto at least some of its six other stations -- two in New York, two in San Francisco, one in Boston and an FM station in Chicago. 

   NBC's Mr. Bongarten wouldn't disclose the few prospective buyers involved in the talks, in which NBC is represented by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
He said "there isn't a firm price tag." 

   But radio consultant Robert Mounty of Mounty Communications, who had been the NBC radio group's No. 2 executive until last year, estimated the network could get $150 million for seven of NBC's eight stations. 
For WKYS-FM in Washington, Mr. Mounty believes the network could receive an additional $45 million. 

   "These stations are among the finest physical facilities in the country, and many of them have great birthrights in the business," Mr. Mounty said. 

   NBC dates back to 1926, when RCA Corp. formed it and purchased what now is New York's WNBC-AM in the hope that starting a radio-station business would help build consumer demand for RCA-made radios. 
Of NBC's eight stations, only WJIB in Boston is a recent purchase, made in 1983; the rest were acquired by 1948. 

   Mr. Bongarten of NBC was said to have told top managers of the network's radio stations this week that the group sale was being discussed. 
He wouldn't say yesterday when an agreement might be reached. 
"Those things need to be fluid." 

   NBC began reviewing its radio operations in mid-1987. 
Disposing of its old-line radio business would be in keeping with the oft-stated strategy of General Electric Chairman Jack F. Welch, who has said GE should remain only in businesses in which it can be a No. 1 or No. 2 player. 
By August, NBC had sold its "radio-network" business, which supplies programming to independent stations, to Westwood One Inc. for $50 million. 

   But NBC also is pressured by federal regulations prohibiting a company from owning television and radio stations in the same city. 
NBC had been exempt because it owned the stations long before the rule was adopted. 
But the exemption ended when General Electric became the new owner of NBC. 
The Federal Communications Commission then granted a temporary waiver of the rule. 
Company spokesmen weren't sure yesterday exactly when that waiver will expire.
