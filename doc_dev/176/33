  [Text] Yes, brother listeners, both at home and abroad: 
This is the truth that refutes the inventions of the al-Ahmar 
clan and its lying media, the truth which makes plain that the 
al-'Anad base will remain steadfast and will not be contaminated 
by the feet of the soldiers of the oppressive al-Ahmar family. 
Greetings to our heroes of our Armed Forces of unity, democracy 
and national modernization which have shown such heroism in 
defeating and pursuing the (?defeated) remnants of the 
traitorous al-Ahmar family.
