Japan's Sony Corp. has donated $3 million, its largest single gift to date to a 
U.S. college, to endow a research and teaching position in electrical and 
computer engineering at the University of Illinois, the school announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The chair to be funded by the grant will be named in honor of John Bardeen, 81, 
a university faculty member who won the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics as 
co-inventor of the transistor. Bardeen also won a Nobel in 1972 for 
co-development of the theory of superconductivity at low temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
One of Sony's earliest products was a radio using the transistor developed by 
Bardeen and his colleagues at Bell Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
The university revealed the gift at opening ceremonies for its $13.5-million 
microelectronics laboratory.
