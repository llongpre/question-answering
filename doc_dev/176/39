In the latest round of radio moniker wars, a federal court judge has ruled that 
talk radio is not a generic term and that KABC-AM (790) has a right to use it 
as an identifying slogan while rival talk station KFI-AM (640) does not. 
</P>
<P>
In an order handed down late Friday but not received by the stations' attorneys 
until Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Richard A. Gadbois ruled against talk 
station KFI-AM (640), which had claimed that the term was generic. The judge's 
decision upheld a May ruling that enjoined KFI from using the term talk radio 
in conjunction with its call letters and dial position. 
</P>
<P>
"KABC has offered evidence that listeners in the Los Angeles AM radio market 
primarily associate talk radio with KABC, not with a program format," Gadbois 
wrote. "This evidence is sufficient such that a reasonable fact finder could 
find that talk radio is not a generic term." 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are delighted with the decision," KABC attorney Steven M. Perry said 
Monday. "This concludes the litigation at the trial court level." 
</P>
<P>
KFI attorneys said they probably will appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
KABC filed a trademark infringement suit against KFI in April, saying that it 
had the sole right to use the talk radio label in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, KABC said it adopted its all-talk format in 1960 and, in 1972, 
"invented and adopted the trademark and trade name 'KABC Talk Radio.' " The 
suit said KABC was the only station to use the term for 17 years until KFI 
began using the slogan in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The two stations argued in federal court Sept. 28 before Gadbois.
