consumer electronics group cuts pre-tax losses to Pounds 20.5m

AMSTRAD, the troubled con-sumer electronics group, has rehired the
technological wizard behind many of its earlier successes and is looking for
a new chief executive as it seeks to restore profitability through growth
and acquisition.
The strategy includes closing Amstrad's Spanish subsidiary and measures to
reduce the company's dependence on the professional personal computer
business.
Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's founder and chairman, said that Mr Robert Watkins,
who left Amstrad last year to become group managing director at Binatone,
had returned to manage Dancall Radio, which Amstrad acquired last month.
Mr Watkins, who was Amstrad's technical director, had been credited with
helping to develop many of the company's 'blockbuster' products. Mr Sugar
said: 'Mr Watkins put us in the satellite business and the personal computer
business. His sole responsibility now will be to look after Dancall Radio.'
The Danish cellular radio company is seen as the key to Amstrad's ambitions
in mobile communications.
Mr Malcolm Miller will take charge of the consumer products group, Amstrad's
core business, while the new chief executive will be responsible for finding
and managing acquisitions in areas, such as mobile communications and
satellite systems, which have synergy with electrical and electronic
products.
Amstrad's results for last year showed that the group returned to
profitability before charges. The share price gained 3p yesterday to close
at 48p.
Operating profits were Pounds 15m and the group earned interest income of
Pounds 7.2m. Closure of the Spanish subsidiary, however, meant that Pounds
25m in goodwill was charged, leaving a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20.5m,
compared with Pounds 70.7m.
Turnover for the year to June 30 was Pounds 308.5m, 13.5 per cent down on
the previous year's Pounds 356.5m. The 1992-93 figure included a
contribution of Pounds 12.2m from acquisitions.
Losses per share were 2p, cut from 6.7p; the company is paying a final
dividend of 0.3p making a total of 0.5p.
Mr Sugar said that Amstrad had continued to reduce both inventories and the
lead-time of products, enabling it to increase net cash to Pounds 167m, from
Pounds 162m last year.
Analysts are suggesting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m
for next year. Mr Sugar, who tried unsuccessfully to take the company
private last year at 30p a share, says the core businesses can only generate
profits of Pounds 10m-Pounds 20m a year. Split between 580m shares, he
contends that earnings would be very low without substantial growth.
