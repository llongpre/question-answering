<HEAD>Most PC's Tested Fail FCC Standards On Radio Interference</HEAD>

   The majority of personal computers recently
tested by the Federal Communications Commission failed to meet the
agency's standards on radio interference, according to a published
report on Wednesday.
   Some 75 percent of the personal computers tested failed to meet
the standards, and the consequent interference can disrupt
television sets or cause problems with other home appliances and
equipment, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
   Companies allegedly are using a variety of tactics to evade the
FCC standards, including instances where a firm will modify a
personal computer to pass the tests but will not incorporate the
modification in other machines it manufactures.
   ``Those machines are what we call laboratory queens,'' said
Jerry Freeman, the FCC's national coordinator for
computer-marketing enforcement. ``The manufacturers don't market
exactly what they submitted to us.''
   Some of the more flagrant violations have been committed by
small offshore companies, especially from Asia, said Freeman.
However, others claim that big-name companies have also had
problems with the FCC in recent years.
   ``They've all had problems,'' said Terry Mahn, a Washington,
D.C., attorney who represents companies in proceedings before the
FCC.
   Merle Coe, president of Washington-based Haar Industries Inc.,
said his company recently tested about 150 computers before finding
one that passed FCC standards.
   Haar Industries, which makes software and accessory circuit
boards, found deficiencies in personal computers made by such large
companies as International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
   The FCC attempts to force compliance by levying $2,000 civil
fines, which Mahn labeled an insufficient threat. Mahn said that in
some cases, the agency has successfully forced companies to reform
by threatening to seize and liquidate thousands of computers in
inventory.
   Freeman said the FCC's spot check included computer models that
had originally passed the agency's Class B standard, based on
earlier tests of sample machines supplied by the manufacturers. The
Class B standard regulates emissions of machines sold for use in
the home.
   Those standards are designed to keep various kinds of products
from causing dangerous interference, like disruption of emergency
signals from police or other government agencies. Freeman said
interference could also cause other computers to lose data.
   The problem for personal computer manufacturers has been
obtaining certification. Various components in a computer generate
radio waves, and companies must make exacting tests with their own
equipment or through independent testing laboratories before
submitting a product for review by the FCC.
   The agency reviews the submitted data and makes its own
additional tests before issuing certification. In the fast-moving
PC market, many companies cannot afford to wait that long.
   ``The problem is the offshore guys, plain and simple,'' said Jim
Johnson, president of Amdador Corp., a Minnesota-based testing
laboratory.
