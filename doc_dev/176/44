  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea on Thursday 
denied as an "invented story" the recent report that more than 
100 North Korean loggers in Siberia were wishing to come to 
South Korea. According to the NAEWOE press, a radio Pyongyang 
broadcast said it is just unthinkable that North Korean people 
try to defect to South Korea. 
  "Our people remain convinced that away from the bosom of the 
Republic, they cannot live even a moment and there is no 
rewarding future for themselves and their descendants," it said. 
The broadcast said this was clearly evidenced by the case of Yi 
In-mo and two people's constabulary unit soldiers who, after 
being rescued by South Korea in the sea, chose to return to the 
North last month. Yi In-mo was a self-styled North Korean war 
correspondent caught in the South during the Korean war as a 
guerrilla fighter, who was sent back to the North last year on 
humanitarian grounds after refusing to change allegiance. The 
radio said that the report about the loggers is a "wild rumor" 
invented by South Korean authorities in their attempt to 
"placate South Korean people's anti-government struggles and 
distract public attention." 
  A Seoul government official said over the weekend that 
hundreds of North Korean loggers escaped from Pyongyang-run 
logging yards in Siberia and more than 100 of them came in 
contact with South Korean missions in Russia for permission to 
come to South Korea. About 16,000 to 20,000 North Koreans are 
known to work at Siberian logging yards under harsh conditions.
