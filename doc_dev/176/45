<F P=106> [Comment by Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of Russian </F>
State Television and Radio Company, under general headline: 
"Tales from the Vienna Woods" -- last paragraph is editorial 
postscript] 
  [Text] We asked Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of the 
Russian State Television and Radio Company, to comment on the 
situation which has taken shape: 
  Last week the Ministry of Finance drew up another draft 
state 
budget. I do not know how good or bad it is in other spheres, 
but as regards the state television and radio companies.... 
Under this draft, which has not yet been approved by the 
government, it is proposed to allocate for the funding of the 
television and radio company, on average, approximately 
one-fourth of the amount that we need for a minimum normal 
existence. This means that Russian radio, for example, will be 
broadcasting for something like five hours a day, and Russian 
television even less -- four hours and 20 minutes. So we will 
have to distribute our air time roughly as follows: from 0730 
through 0900 hours for those who are already awake. From 1600 
through 1730 for children, so that they do not forget that the 
television has been invented. In the evening it will be 
possible to put out "Vesti," followed by a 10- or 15-minute 
program with a topical account of the government's concern for 
its people. 
  I certainly do not think that the quality of all our 
programs 
is on a high level. And yet an important question occurs to me 
with regard to this draft budget: What does the Finance 
Ministry expect those people who are accustomed to sitting on 
the sofa in front of the television after work in the evening to 
do with themselves if the television set is showing nothing? We 
could think up a lot of answer to this question, but none of 
them in society's favor. This is not to mention the fact that 
we will have to dismiss three-fourths of our employees without a 
leaving gratuity.... As is known, we were born to turn a 
fairytale into a true story. Sometimes it is a very frightening 
fairytale. Although I am a great fan of science fiction, I find 
it hard to believe that, before approving the draft, the 
government will review the question of television funding. But 
there is still a glimmer of hope. 
  [Postcript] While this issue was being made up, the problem 
of funding state television and radio companies has developed 
further. The president has met with the heads of "Ostankino" 
and the Russian State Television and Radio Company and promised 
them support, saying that there must definitely be state 
television in Russia. "Although the budget will be cut just the 
same," Anatoliy Lysenko declared after meeting with the 
president. "The question is: by how much? But the government 
must decide this."
