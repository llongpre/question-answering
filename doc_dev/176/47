communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: "In Full Swing. 
The Signal Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at Work"] 
  [Text] Military communications evolved in the remote past, 
when the unique features of East Slavic military art began to 
emerge. At that time, troops in the battlefield were led by 
voice commands, the personal example of their commanders, and 
signals sent by audible devices. That is how commanders passed 
on orders and instructions and received reports. 
  However, these simple means of communication could be used 
to 
exercise command over troops only as long as military actions 
took place on small areas of land, usually on open ground, and 
commanders personally observed the battlefield. 
  Fundamentally new means of communication came into use in 
the 
wars fought in the second half of the 19th century and the 
beginning of the 20th century -- the telegraph and the 
telephone, the invention of which was made possible by the 
important contributions of such leading scientists and inventors 
as T.L. Shylling, V.S. Yakobi, V.B. Yakobi, P.M. Holubytskyy, 
Ye.I. Hvozdyov, A.A. Stolpovskyy, and others. 
  On 25 April (7 May) 1895, an important event took place in 
the history of mankind. On this day, A.S. Popov, in a paper 
delivered at the session of the Physical Division of the Russian 
Physico-Chemical Society, reported the discovery of a new means 
of communicating -- radio. The device he created made it 
possible to transmit electrical oscillations (signals) without 
wires. This was a truly great discovery. 
  From this moment on, scientists in many countries began 
working intensively on the practical application of this 
wonderful phenomenon. 
  Radio technology [radiometody], which involves the 
generation 
and propagation of radio waves, also forms the basis of 
radio-relay, tropospheric, and space communication lines, radio 
broadcasting, television, radiometry, phototelegraphy, and many 
other fields. 
  Radio communication uses wave frequencies that range from 
hundreds of hertz to tens and more gigahertz (GHz). Very low 
frequency [VLF], low frequency [LF], high frequency [HF], and 
ultrahigh frequency [UHF] radio communication lines enable 
control in all fields of human endeavor. Radio performs 
miracles. Radio waves are reflected from meteor trails, and they 
penetrate the thickness of the ocean's waves; they are used 
underground and in space; they bring us information about other 
bodies in the universe. 
  Radio communication plays a particularly important role in 
the Armed Forces. Clearly, no modern war can be won without 
reliable, uninterrupted communications. To lose the ability to 
communicate means to lose the ability to control your forces, 
and the loss of the ability to exercise command over forces 
inevitably results in defeat. This fundamental principle, 
established during the years of the Great Patriotic War, remains 
equally important today. 
  Radio makes it possible to exercise command over troops and 
weapons at any time of the year and at any time of day or night, 
requiring no search and no superstructure [bez poshuku and bez 
nadbudovy], when stationed in one place and when on the move, 
over the heads of the enemy. 
  Modern military radio equipment makes it possible to block 
the interception of information and sometimes even to prevent 
the discovery that radio waves are being used. 
  This radio equipment has made it possible to create 
fundamentally new organizational structures of mobile signal 
centers at various echelons of command. These structures are 
easily operated, mobile, and provide commanders and staffs with 
means of communication both in place and on the move [na mistsi 
i v rusi]. 
  The role of technical training of military personnel -- of 
every soldier and every commander -- has grown immeasurably in 
modern times. The range of skills that a member of the signal 
troops [voyin-svyazkivets] has to master has expanded 
significantly. Thus an officer must have the knowledge and 
skills of a well-trained service engineer. Sergeants and 
privates can also be trained to perform the tasks of technicians 
or mechanics. This has established the requirements in the 
training of signal troops. The majority of graduates of military 
signals schools, training units, and subunits are true masters 
in their field, capable of operating complex modern equipment. 
  In the experienced hands of military signals personnel, the 
means of communication make it possible for the command 
[komanduvannya] to exercise uninterrupted and timely control of 
forces and weapons. And the signal troops of the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine have experienced hands. 
  The Signal Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine work 
diligently and painstakingly to hone their professional skills. 
During the winter academic term, a series of complex training 
exercises involving the radio communications system were carried 
out by the Signal Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The 
results of the exercises revealed excellent skills in operating 
complex radio communications equipment by signals specialists 
and the ability of officers to command subordinate subunits in 
providing support in the control and command of troops. 
  The collectives commanded by officers V. Mystyuk, I. 
Royenko, 
V. Shevchyk, A. Yemets, and S. Maslov perform with special 
distinction. The discipline, assiduity, and excellent knowledge 
of regulation equipment [vyvirena tekhnika] exhibitied by the 
personnel of these units and subunits allows them to perform 
their assigned tasks quickly and with a high degree of 
efficiency. 
  Officers V. Sanarov, S. Butuzov, V. Tabak, A. Levchenko, V. 
Lysakonov, S. Dmytriyenko, and F. Kulishenko have shown 
themselves to be excellent specialists and good methodists 
[metodysty]. 
  Many good things can be said about the crews [ekipazhi] led 
by warrant officers Yu. Semenov, V. Rybachuk, S. Pyenkin, V. 
Bryshchatyy, P. Bondar, V. Mandalyna, V. Dehtyarov, and S. 
Litvynenko. Even in peacetime, the signals personnel continue to 
perform their professional duties in the ranks of the UN 
peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. M. Metla, V. 
Kichkar, V. Kulykov, S. Kyrpychnyy, and L. Zolotoholovyy perform 
their duties with distinction. 
  Watch duty [boyove cherhuvannya] is part of performing a 
battle mission [boyove zavdannya]. The high degree of 
responsibility and conscientiousness exhibited by A. Volva, M. 
Chechko, M. Hrytsyuta, S. Derkach, V. Bilenkyy, Yu. Prokhorov, 
I. Kulyk, Yu. Mostovyy, and V. Oliynyk have won them the respect 
of their commanders and peers. 
  Much praise is merited by female military personnel and 
employees [viyskosluzhbovtsi i sluzhbovtsi] of the Armed Forces 
who serve as radio operators, telegraph operators, and telephone 
operators [radysty, telehrafisty, telefonisty]. In particular, 
employees [sluzhbovtsi] of the Armed Forces M. Kornet and L. 
Matveyeva. 
  The annual reinforcement of the officer corps of the Signal 
Troops with graduates of the Kiev Institute of Control and 
Command and Signals [instytut upravlinnya i zvyazku] and the 
Poltava Higher Military Command Signals School [vyshche viyskove 
komandne uchylyshche zvyazku] also contributes to the excellent 
performance of tasks designed to guarantee communications. A 
great deal of effort and energy is devoted to the training of 
future officers by instructors V. Starkov, V. Dudolad, and V. 
Tymoshynskyy. 
  On the eve of the Great Victory Day over fascism, I would 
like to wish veterans and young soldiers, experienced and novice 
signals personnel good health, personal happiness, and continued 
success in the building of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 
ensuring these forces with a high degree of combat readiness.
