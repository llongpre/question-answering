    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1000 GMT on 26 May broadcasts a 4.5-minute report that radio 
and television companies across Russia are going to set up a 
league as a measure against the law on mass media which is about 
to be adopted by the State Duma. The announcer says that the 
proposed law stipulates the creation of the state Duma's 
exclusive TV and radio service, which, the announcer says, will 
be financed from the federal budget, thus reducing the amount of 
financial support presently allocated to other state media. 
  Anatoliy Batyushkin, head of the department of radio and 
television at the Ministry of Communications, is asked by a 
Radio Rossii correspondent about the present financial situation 
in the broadcasting industry. He says: 
  "At present we owe the power engineers about 50 billion 
rubles [R] for the electrical energy already supplied to TV 
centers. The TV and radio broadcasting companies' debt for the 
first quarter stands at R192 billion. Until now only R100 
billion have been repaid. Only R25 billion has been used to pay 
salaries, buy spare parts, etc, while in fact, the power 
engineers need at least R50 billion for the first quarter year." 
  Asked whether broadcasting will go back to normal in the 
near 
future, Batyushkin says: 
  "I think that we will be able to work well if the federal 
television and radio broadcasting service does in fact achieve 
stable financing. If we are paid, no conflict situation, 
nothing will interfere with nonstop broadcasting, just as it 
used to be when we had a system when a single minute of unused 
time at some or other transmitter was considered to be an 
emergency situation." 
  In response to that comment, Radio Rossii correspondent 
Aleksandr Kurekov says: 
  "First of all, a few words from a note on technical 
stoppages 
of transmitters broadcasting Radio Rossii programs. From 24 
May, because of lack of energy supplies, transmitters in Taldym, 
near Moscow, Blagoveshchensk in Amur oblast, and in Chita are 
inoperative. These transmitters used to provide one of the most 
stable feeds of radio programs on longwave." Kurekov adds that 
people in these areas can no longer hear the 650 or so reports 
from localities provided by Radio Rossii's correspondents, or 
the 200-300 reports filed by them from near-abroad and other 
countries. He also said that Kaluga, Smolensk, Tver, and 
Voronezh oblasts have been left without Radio Rossii's programs 
as well.
