STARTING this week, the World Service is to run, over the next two months, a
Spotlight on South Asia, about the Indian sub-continent and its neighbours.
In four programmes on successive Mondays, John Renner will examine affairs
in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. This week's, Division and Identity,
begins with a recording of Nehru's promise that the Indians will 'redeem our
pledge' - a promise at once torpedoed by the Hindu-Moslem division that gave
birth to Pakistan, and subsequently Bangladesh.
Situations in these three nations are sharply scrutinised, with telling
interventions from local voices. Next week Renner will consider social
matters, and the week after, the 'huddled masses' in the regions of great
poverty, with a view of the causes and the conceivable cures.
There will be features and plays from the same countries too, including  -
on St. Valentine's Day] - a Sanskrit tragi-comedy, Hayavadana, where rivals
for the same woman each cut their own heads off. The goddess Kali puts them
back, but unhappily she gets the heads on the wrong shoulders . . .
The Imperial thread was tugged again on Friday in Radio 3's A Future for
Their Past. Christopher Hope, a native South African, presented other South
African writers, black and white, on the future of South African writing
after the end of apartheid. What shall we have to write about seemed to be
the principal question, and the main answer was the past. Lately, stories of
repression and resistance, said JM Coetzee, had seemed more important than
inventive fiction. Free from censorship, the South Africans had to learn
about themselves - especially the blacks, whose history was mainly recalled
from their conflicts with the invaders. Next week Radio 3 will give five
South African Snapshots, to include work by some of the contributors to this
programme.
Radio 3's Sunday play this week was a subtle piece by David Pownall, Dreams
and Censorship, that contrived to include in its dramatis personae St. John
the Divine, King James I and William Shakespeare. The King (Hugh Ross) is
anxious that the new English Bible shall not include the Book of Revelation
lest it encourage revolt. Shakespeare (Edward Petherbridge), whom the King
calls Willy, is directing a company in the events that took place on Patmos,
where St. John (Robert Stephens) has retired, and where the Romans are to
crucify two vestal virgins, one of them played by randy young Prince Charles
(Gary King).
The arguments that connect these events are as entertaining as they are
interesting, even if sometimes as historically dodgy as (say) Henry V; they
lead properly to the inclusion of Revelation in the King James Bible that we
know. The playing throughout is first-class under Eoin O'Callaghan's
direction.
Good Wives (Radio 4 FM, Thursday) is the sequel to Alcott's Little Women,
which has been dramatised in six parts by Marcie Kahan. We begin with Meg's
wedding to John Brooke, and go on to Amy's disappointing day out with the
young ladies of her drawing class, that only one of the invited dozen
attends. If you enjoyed Little Women you will enjoy this, for the girls seem
hardly to have grown up at all. Marilyn Imrie directs, and Marmee is no less
than Gayle Hunnicutt.
The Saturday play on Radio 4 was David Halliwell's Crossed Lines, that began
with a chap being offered Pounds 88,000 by a strange woman on the telephone,
and went on as improbably for 90 minutes. The lucky guy was Ian Hogg and the
director Philip Martin.
Richard Imison, one of the best influences on radio drama, died from cancer
last week. He had been the BBC's script editor for almost 30 years, later
its deputy director of drama.
