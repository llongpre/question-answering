<LEADPARA>  AT STANFORD University's computer-music studio, a new breed of
engineer-musician-inventor that never existed in the days of Beethoven,
Wagner, Gershwin or Mahler is developing innovative ways of making music.;   
Max V. Mathews belongs to that new breed.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This crack Bell Laboratories researcher from Murray Hill, N.J., is revered
among computer-composers for having developed digital synthesis, a process
that brought electronic music beyond vacuum tubes, analog circuitry, audio
tape and scissors.;    Mathews came to Stanford in 1987 as he was nearing
retirement age. But anybody who thought his tenure here would be tantamount to
semi-retirement was in for a surprise.;    Mathews, who is about to turn 65,
has been busy building and demonstrating prototypes of his latest invention --
the radio baton -- which promises to turn electronic music into a much more
spontaneous, responsive medium than ever before.;    High-quality sound; 
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA,
pronounced "karma") has been internationally acclaimed since its beginnings
back in the 1960s.;    Its experiments in computer-generated sound reached
something of a crescendo a decade later with founder-director John Chowning's
development of FM-synthesis, a patented process widely used by Yamaha and
others to produce a high-quality sound from synthesizers.;    Now the studio
is gearing up for its annual outdoor concert, to be presented Thursday evening
at Frost Amphitheater. That program will put computer-music pieces by six
composers in the spotlight.;    An overriding problem with electronic music
has been its tempo limitations. When computer tracks were used to accompany
live instruments, the live musicians had no choice but to follow the beat of
the computer. Instead of the circuitry being slave to the living performer, it
was the other way around.;    Leading performers hate to perform to a computer
tape accompaniment, notes Mathews, "because they have to follow." Needless to
say, that limitation stifled creativity and prompted many musicians to shun
the potentially stimulating electronic collaborations.;    'A very simple
thing';  Mathews is one of several researchers trying to do something about
the problem. Roughly a decade ago, when composer-conductor Pierre Boulez
grappled gloomily with a computer-tape accompaniment that was, in effect, his
master rather than his servant, Mathews decided it was high time for a
change.;    While others have worked on conductors' batons that control the
computer sound, Mathews' has developed a drum-like system that deftly cues the
beats for the computer-stored music, changing its speed or volume at the whim
of its musician-operator. The radio baton is both unique and patented.;   
Mathews is characteristically modest about the invention. "It's a very simple
thing," he says. But a recent demonstration in the CCRMA studios at the Knoll
overlooking the Stanford campus showed something of its potential.;    Soprano
Maureen Chowning, the wife of John Chowning, sang a particularly slow,
delicate Mozart aria, "Deh, vieni," from the opera "Le Nozze di Figaro" to an
accompaniment controlled by the radio baton. The keyboard accompaniment was
stored in the computer, and the playback was cued by Mathews tapping gently
with his drum device. Chowning was able to sustain notes for musical effect,
and Mathews was able to make the accompaniment follow her.;    Mathews has
even more ambitious ideas. He plans to store entire orchestral scores on the
computer and then cue them for use in concertos with the radio baton. "I'd
like to do a whole Beethoven concerto," he says, "with me on the orchestral
part and a soloist live at the piano.";    In fact, once he passes the hurdle
of synthesizing entire orchestral parts, Mathews could bring the whole of the
concerto repertory to the beck and call of soloists developing their
interpretations. Music teachers could use these with advanced violin pupils.
Concerto competitions could harness them, too, in lieu of the piano
accompaniments used today from San Jose to New York City.;    "I try to
control all of the expressive side, while the computer does all the
predetermined parts," notes Mathews.;    For Mathews, however, playing the
musical accompanist is an unaccustomed role. His own musical background
includes neither drum nor keyboard. As he puts it, "I love to play my violin,
but I'm a poor player. I've always looked for instruments that were easier to
play.";    So -- voila! -- the radio baton.;    The holder of a doctorate from
MIT, Mathews is a distinguished and versatile scientist elected to both the
National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. He has
published widely. His radio baton was written up in two different publications
in 1989. The patent was granted last year. He has demonstrated the device in
several countries, most recently France.;    In addition to loudness and
meter, the radio baton can control the amount of vibrato (the vibrancy that
lends luster to a note), whether via voice or violin or synthesizer.;   
Composing in new scales;  Mathews has found an outspoken supporter for the
device in Boston composer Richard Boulanger, who has written several pieces
for it, among them "Holiday Music for the Evening," a setting of a poem by
Hermann Hesse for voice and radio baton.;    Boulanger exploits the
versatility of the computer-music medium by writing in a new scale, which
sounds like the notes from some radically retuned piano. His work bolsters
Mathews' contention that the purpose of computer music isn't to ape existing
music; "it will be to open new doors," says Mathews.;    To demonstrate
Boulanger's work, Maureen Chowning sings it and the computer sounds follow
along in eerie pitches that bygone composers could only have dreamed about,
sending delectable shivers up the spine.;    New doors are opening. And
electronic music clearly has moved far beyond the cliched effects of
horror-movie soundtracks into a realm of greater artistry. Now that the
parameters of expression can be controlled by keen-eared musicians rather than
machines, the sky's the limit.;  Annual outdoor concert of the Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics; Featuring works by Davidovsky,
Kimura, Schottstaedt, Lo, Loy and Oppenheim; Where: Frost Amphitheater,
Stanford University; When: 8:15 p.m. Thursday; Tickets: $7; Call: (415)
