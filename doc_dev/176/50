   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., which got its
start with a break-through automatic rice cooker, is looking to
bolster its consumer electronics business while moving into
higher-profit industrial areas, analysts say.
   The company's products could stock an entire appliance store and
then some: radios, tape recorders, refrigerators, air conditioners,
video-cassette recorders and more.
   Some of its most widely recognized brands are Panasonic,
Technics and Quasar.
   Matsushita Electric confirmed it is negotiating to buy
entertainment giant MCA, which has a vast library of movies and
television programs, in a deal valued at around $7 billion.
   With its 163 consolidated subsidiaries, Matsushita Electric
forms Japan's third largest corporation and commands the largest
share of Japan's home electronics market. A Morgan Stanley survey
in June ranked Matsushita the 25th-largest publicly-held
corporation in the world.
   It is also known to insiders as the ``Matsushita bank,''
reporting holdings of over $10 billion in cash assets alone last
year. Total sales topped $41.6 billion.
   The influence of legendary founder Konosuke Matsushita is felt
in virtually every Japanese home where an automatic rice cooker
takes the drudgery out of preparing the nation's staple food.
   Matsushita, a man who never went to high school yet became
Japan's most famous entrepreneur, popularized the electric rice
cooker in the 1950s in keeping with his corporate philosophy: ``To
manufacture items of good quality for daily use in abundant supply,
thereby enriching and improving life for everyone.''
   That comment in 1932 came a little less than 15 years after the
23-year-old Matsushita left his employer to capitalize on his own
electrical switch invention. Today, the Matsushita empire has
spawned nearly 500 related firms operating in 36 countries.
   During the 37 years it has operated in the United States,
Matsushita has built 12 factories, established seven sales
companies and a research facility and employs some 10,000 people.
   But the company is now facing a crossroads. Over 60 percent of
its sales have been concentrated in low-growth consumer products
such as refrigerators and video-cassette recorders. Compared to
other Japanese electronics makers, it is having difficulty making
the jump to more profitable industrial sectors, analysts say.
   It has also been unable to come up with a new hit product to
take the place of the wildly successful VCR, reflecting the
company's strength in manufacturing capability over inventive
prowess.
   Boris Petersik, an analyst for Barclay de Zoete Wedd Securities
Ltd., notes that Matsushita's mere size - including its 25,000
affiliated retailers in Japan - has proved a burden to shifting its
resources.
   The group plans to change, however. It developed a long-term
plan six years ago to focus on seven areas of high technology
including computers, semiconducters and communication technology.
   By 1992, the company hopes those areas will account for 40
percent of total sales.
   This year, the company has been investing huge amounts - some
400 billion Japanese yen ($3.2 billion) - in crystal displays,
computers and semiconductors. It is also trying to develop
profitable movie and television cameras for professional use,
Petersik said.
   But Matsushita has had a hard time cracking Sony's dominance on
the professional market as well as its lead in the consumer market
for VCRs. Sony now has the rich video software resources it
purchased last year in its $5 billion acquisition of Columbia
Pictures Entertainment, he said.
   ``They don't want to lose completely on consumer products,'' he
said. The MCA acquisition, if it goes through, would both give the
company access to software to keep its consumer-products sales
healthy and to studios where it could introduce its professional
products.
   ``Software is going to be the critical factor'' in the video
market, Martin Beresford, senior analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities Ltd., said of the Japanese company's possible MCA
purchase.
   A company spokesman in Tokyo said MCA is only one of the
companies with which Matsushita is involved in talks, but said
nothing had been decided. He said he could not comment further.
   The acquisition also would indicate that the company is
recovering from the death last year of the 94-year-old company
founder, according to Petersik.
   Revered as a visionary of Japanese business, Matsushita was also
one of Japan's richest men, leaving an estate valued $1.7 billion.
   And he was among Japan's most generous individuals. In a country
where charitable contributions do not qualify for tax breaks, he
established his own non-profit foundation, opened his factories to
the handicapped and endowed cultural institutions and a private
school for training future leaders.
