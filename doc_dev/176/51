  [Text] We have received a statement from the press service 
of the commander of Ukraine's National Guard: 
  As has become well-known, Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea's 
minister of internal affairs, has disseminated false information 
that the subunits of Ukraine's National Guard, which are 
deployed in Simferopol, were supposedly brought to combat 
readiness and received an order to storm the town's vital 
facilities. In truth, the Simferopol guardsmen's military unit 
personnel are in their barracks. 
  On the evening of 21 May, Viktor Mezhak, first deputy 
chairman of the Crimea's Supreme Council, visited the unit with 
a group of deputies, who ascertained that the guardsmen had 
normal everyday concerns unconnected with some kind of emergency 
preparations. In particular, Aleksandr Kostikov, commander of 
the unit, reported that he had not received any orders and had 
not given the order to his subordinates to prepare for any 
emergency actions. 
  And here Valeriy Kuznetsov resorted to deceit to have a 
reason for his own provocative actions. At about 1800 [1500 
GMT] on 21 May, the minister brought the employees of the 
Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry to increased combat readiness 
and armed them with automatic weapons. He ordered them to carry 
out reinforced protection of the television and radio center, 
the telephone exchange, and the Supreme Council of Crimea. 
  The press service of the commander of Ukraine's National 
Guard states: The guard's subunits are in the places of their 
permanent deployment. The citizens of Simferopol may be calm. 
Ukraine's National Guard is not preparing for the assaults 
invented by Mr. Kuznetsov.
