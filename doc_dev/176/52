FOR THOSE still able to get a laugh out of finance, Radio 4 has devised The
Board Game, Mondays, repeated late the following Sunday - a quiz like the
sports quizzes, where players are more likely to score with an able memory
than an ace service. Here are some sample questions.
To what financial figure would you ascribe this extract (actual) from a
speech? What is meant by red bits, me-too products, PIMS? How do you
interpret the body-language of applicants for jobs? How will you explain
your apparently disloyal behaviour? Neil Koenig, the producer, knows what he
is about, and the players are quick on the ball.
On Thursday Radio 4 gave us Blood Sports for Girls, about the games they
play at school. Girls between 12 and 16 were quite honest with reporter Sara
Parker about their uncharming acts, which were not to do with sex. Gangs
would pick on special victims and accuse them of some nasty, or silly,
quality, real or imaginary. Friendships or dislikes might be virtually
enforced. The object in every case was the frank wish for power.
The programme, cleverly produced by Tessa Watt, struck me as a nature
programme as much as a social comment. But on the previous day, the front
page of our local paper was given over to the case of a girl so badly
bullied at her school she had to be taken away. She had suffered blood
sports as beastly - worse even - as those in the programme. It is not for me
to comment on such things. I leave it to Esther Rantzen.
Does Radio 3 want to counter the weight of the Proms with extra light drama?
The last two weeks have been awfully trivial. I wrote last week about the
Sunday play, Burn the Aeneid. This week we had Antrobus and the Lion by
David Stafford, one of a pair of 'Unmade Movies' - another next week.
It is unmade because David Selznick, wanting a star writer to do his script
for Gone with the Wind, bets Sam Goldwyn he will get Bernard Shaw. What is
more, Hazel Antrobus, the cat-burglar caught in his house, will get him to
do it. So indeed she does, as a parody of Liza from Pygmalion, supported by
Loewe's music from My Fair Lady. It was well played, but even Jeremy Howe's
direction could not make it bearable.
The previous evening we had Two into Three, wrapped around the Prom. In the
first 20 minutes, Tudor,a fat retired policeman, goes to the Prom to pick up
a woman. Silly Pamela, who has had trouble arriving, sits by him and agrees
to have a drink in the interval (another 30 minutes). He tells her about
having accidentally arrested Sir Adrian Boult; she tells him about her
creative writing course and her preference for boxing over music. They hear
RVW's Sea Symphony and go to supper in a local restaurant (a final 40
minutes).
Their talk lapses increasingly into fantasy, often BBC-based, sometimes
sexual but not mutual. The writer is Peter Tinniswood, whose talent is to
invent amusing characters and find things for them to do. He has hung a load
of potential comedy on Tudor and Pamela (Richard Griffiths and Elizabeth
Spriggs) but given them nothing funny to say. John Tydeman directed.
The quarterly complaints bulletin from the Radio Authority is interesting.
Of 31 complaints against independent stations, only five were upheld, two of
them with reservation, and seven out of 18 complaints against advertisers.
Five listeners complained that Sunrise FM (Bradford) broadcast in Urdu, not
in other Indian dialects; 960 listeners signed an identical complaint.
Spectrum Radio (Greater London) had dropped a programme on Afro-Caribbean
matters, and appalled one listener with an 'occult' programme in Arabic. An
LBC presenter had imitated an Asian accent. Every ethnic community must have
its own station everywhere.
