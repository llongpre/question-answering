   World shipping leaders have given the go-ahead for
the introduction of new, automatic communications that will mean the
end of the Morse code for ships at sea.
   The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System transmits and
receives automatically, so Morse will no longer be a requirement for
ships. Shipowners are expected to phase out radio operators when the
new equipment is installed in ships, starting in 1993.
   Some parts of the new technology, which includes satellite
communications, are already in use on British ships and from 1999
they will be compulsory on ships worldwide.
   The decision was taken Friday during a two-week London conference
of the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency
for the safety of shipping and preventing ships polluting the seas.
   The 66 countries represented accounted for about 97 percent of
the world's ships, said spokesman Roger Kohn.
   A statement afterward called the decision ``one of the biggest
advances in maritime communications since the introduction of
radio.''
   The new system allows the crew to send a distress signal by
pushing a button, which should prevent ships disappearing without a
trace when messages cannot be sent in time.
   Ships will also carry a radio beacon, which will give the ship's
position and must be able to float free if the ship sinks suddenly.
   Kohn said: ``Morse has great romantic connotations with the
gallant radio operator sending off distress calls as the ship sinks.
But we are bringing in something that will be much better and which
should save even more lives.''
   The Morse code, invented by American Samuel Morse and first used
in 1844, has been the foundation of ship's distress and safety
messages since the turn of the century. It is a series of long and
short electronic ``dots and dashes'' representing letters of the
alphabet.
   Morse code was used to inform an incredulous world that the
supposedly unsinkable oceanliner Titanic was sinking in the North
Atlantic in 1912. The Titanic sank swiftly and 1,500 people perished.
