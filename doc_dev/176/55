   Alexander M. Lewyt, an inventor who
developed a vacuum cleaner designed to operate without interfering
with TV or radio reception, has died at age 79.
   Lewyt died on Friday.
   Born in New York, Lewyt was the son of an Austrian immigrant who
ran a gadget shop.
   He held patents on scores of inventions.
   When he learned of undertakers' difficulty in fastening neckties
on corpses, the teen-age Lewyt devised a new kind of bow tie that
clipped on. He sold 50,000 of them. It was unclear whether he ever
patented the concept.
   He was best known for the compact Lewyt vacuum cleaner, which
had no dust bag and was designed not to cause interference.
   In the first eight years after his vacuum cleaner was introduced
after World War II, Lewyt Corp. sold 2 million of them. During the
war, Lewyt Corp. did a multi-million dollar business making such
things as radar antennas and popcorn poppers.
   Lewyt sold his interest in the company to the Budd Corp. in the
1950s.
