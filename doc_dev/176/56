   The National Broadcasting Co. said Friday it had
tentatively agreed to sell five radio stations to Emmis
Broadcasting Corp., a privately-held concern based in Indianapolis,
for $121.5 million.
   NBC had previously disclosed it was looking for buyers for its
seven radio stations, and reaffirmed that it hoped to sell the
remaining stations.
   The stations which would be sold to Emmis Broadcasting under a
letter of intent are WNBC-AM and WYNY-FM in New York, WJIB-FM in
Boston, WKQX-FM in Chicago and KYUU-FM in San Francisco.
   The sale is subject to a definitive agreement by the companies
and approval by their respective boards of directors, the
announcement from NBC said.
   The sale would leave NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric Co.,
with radio stations WKYS in Washington, D.C., and KNBR in San
Francisco. The company has said it hopes to sell the Washington
station to a minority group.
   Emmis Broadcasting, which was founded in 1980 and claims to be
the largest privately-held radio broadcasting company in the United
States, already owns seven radio stations, including two in New
York City, WFAN-AM and WQHT-FM.
   The announcement said Emmis would have to ``resolve ownership
conflict in New York'' if the sale were completed. Federal
regulations prohibit companies from owning more than one AM and one
FM radio station in a single media market, according to a spokesman
for NBC, Dom Giofre.
   Emmis president Jeffrey Smulyan said that no decision has been
made on which of the four New York stations would be sold.
   In addition to the two New York stations, Emmis owns KPWR-FM in
Los Angeles; WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C.; KSHE-FM in St. Louis;
WLOL-FM in Minneapolis; and WENS-FM in Indianapolis.
   NBC is rooted in radio broadcasting. Radio Corp. of America
formed NBC in 1926 when it purchased what is now WNBC-AM in New
York.
   RCA and NBC were acquired by GE in 1986 and NBC began reviewing
its radio operations in mid-1987.
   Last summer, it sold its radio network business, which supplies
programming to independent stations, for $50 million to Westwood
One Inc., a radio production and distribution company based in Los
Angeles.
   NBC sold its WMAQ-AM radio station in Chicago earlier this year
for $13 million, Giofre said.
