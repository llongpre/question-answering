   It wasn't easy work.
   ``I've got stuff in that book _ maybe five or six lines _ that
has taken me 30 to 40 years to verify.''
   Kane has mellowed with the years. He still gives lectures _
``rambles'' he calls them _ and manages to irritate the crowd by
debunking ``truths'' learned in grade school.
   But he's softer now.
   ``I used to be a wise guy. I would write letters correcting
people. I once corrected someone on a number of facts in a
presentation and I embarrassed him and broke his heart. And after
all, what difference does it really make?''
   Kane says he gets three or four calls from the White House each
year, asking him a question. For the White House, he'll answer. But
he makes sure. He knows the number and tells the aide he will call
back. If the aide gives the right number, then Joe Kane stays on
the line and answers the question.
   When industry calls and asks if he can find some first for them,
he explains it will cost $35,000 and he won't guarantee he'll find
the answer. Budget planners don't hop on that kind of honesty.
   ``A lot of what I have in the book is there by serendipity. It's
not something I set out to look up. You can't look up half of these
things. You just come across them as you go along.''
   Kane plays a 50-year-old record for a visitor, memorabilia from
Kane's career as a writer for the early quiz shows. He wrote all
the questions for ``Break the Bank,'' a network radio show that
began in 1945 and finally finished up on television in the '50s.
Kane also supplied some questions for ``The $64,000 Question'' and
``Double or Nothing'' and had just written a book on how to win on
quiz shows when scandal rocked the industry and the book lost its
chance to become a big seller.
   In a safe deposit box, Kane has a number of other treasures,
including the first fountain pen, a shoe with a revolving heel to
account for wear and the first safety pin with the patent number
still on it. That number, for trivia buffs, is 24,517.
   His newspaper articles are stored in metal boxes, over a century
old, that the New York Central used to keep its records in.
   Kane is an expert on presidents and is working on the fifth
edition of ``Facts About the Presidents.''
   Kane is a slightly shrunken 5-feet-8, with white hair, a neatly
trimmed white beard, a fairly brisk gait, and general good health,
despite a slight hearing loss. He says his parents lived well into
their 90s and he intends to do at least as well.
   ``I've made a rather Faustian pact with the devil,'' he
deadpans. ``I'll be ready to go two days after I finish my last
project. But you see I've left myself quite an open back door.''
   Kane and a lady friend spend two weeks every year at a Mexican
spa, where he relaxes, eats a vegetarian diet and boasts about the
fact that the ceilings are dusted twice a day with feather dusters.
That compensates for the scorpions noted on the floor.
   Kane sees his tilting at the windmills of history as really a
fight for the underdog, the truly creative man or woman who never
made the history books because someone else had better public
relations skills.
   His favorite inventor and personal hero is William Hunt, an
inventor who died in 1859. It was he, says Kane, who invented the
sewing machine 12 years before Howe. Kane sees most of the true
inventors as pathetic figures and Hunt outclasses them all.
   His voice picks up even more life as he talks about Hunt.
   ``I've only given him half the credit to which he is entitled,
but when you read it you will cry. He had such a tough life.
Everybody said he was crazy, but he wasn't.''
   Hunt's story exemplifies one of Nathan's favorite sayings, one
he has on a placard: ``The person with a new idea is a crackpot _
until it succeeds.''
   ``The story will bring no one any money, but I think it will be
the most interesting biography you will ever read.''
   ``Or,'' adds the man who refuses ever to take himself too
seriously, ``it will sell six copies.''
