   Jackie Sexton had to look no farther than
her father's stomach for inspiration in a contest for practical
inventions.
   The 11-year-old East Greenwich resident won a regional prize for
her design of an expandable dress shirt for ``pudgy pops.''
   When the contest sponsored by the non-profit Invent America was
announced in her sixth-grade class, she immediately thought of a
complaint by her father, Richard, that his dress shirts show too
much stomach when he sat down.
   ``My father complained for years about his shirt,'' she said.
   Jackie split the side seams of one of her father's shirts and
sewed in spandex. The shirt was a success the first time he sat down.
   Her invention, ``Pudgy Pop, the Expandable Dress Shirt for Men,''
won the Rhode Island and regional competitions. The young inventor
won a trip to Washington for herself and her family and a $500
savings bond, as well as a $750 grant for her teacher and a $1,250
grant for her school.

   April Abbott started a dating service that caters
to intellectuals about three years ago, and she said she's had
plenty of successful matches.
   She's also had plenty of eggheads.
   Ms. Abbott has about 450 clients, and she said 75 percent have
master's degrees or doctorates. Some are superpicky, she said,
approaching romance as if it could be measured and ordered from a
catalogue.
   One man showed Ms. Abbott a chart he had drawn up to find his
dream woman: If the woman was 5 feet tall, she had to be under 100
pounds; if she was 5-1, then she had to be under 104 pounds, and so
on.
   A few academicians have used scientific arguments, hoping to
spark chemistry that wasn't there, she said. One man who was over 55
years old took his blood pressure in front of a young woman to prove
that he wouldn't die of a heart attack during moments of passion.
   And then there's the woman who married the third man she met
through the service, but still wasn't satisified.
   The woman demanded that she be set up with three other men to
``get her money's worth.'' Instead, Ms. Abbott refunded half of her
$125 fee.

   Politicians often seek a captive
audience, and Gov. Ned McWherter has found one: around town in
restrooms, where his face smiles from a radio station's advertising
posters.
   The advertisement shows the governor wearing a cap bearing the
name of Bubba Skynyrd, a ``redneck'' character who is the alter ego
of disc jockey Carl P. Mayfield on WKDF-FM's morning rock 'n' roll
radio show. McWherter's right hand is raised.
   ``Haaay Dudes! I took the oath ... to listen mornings,'' the ad
says.
   Nashville's Graffiti Indoor Advertising placed the ads last month
in about 36 Nashville locations, mostly in restaurant bathrooms,
said account executive Lars Frederiksen.
   ``I was at a press conference, one of Carl P.'s boys passed me a
cap and I put it on and posed, and that's how I got involved,''
McWherter told WKRN-TV before leaving for Europe this week to
recruit industry.
   McWherter spokesman Ken Renner said the governor generally
prefers not to have his office or likeness used for advertising.
   ``There's not much we can do about it,'' Renner said.
