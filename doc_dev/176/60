   Four American scientists and a West
German won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry Thursday for
discoveries that have given the world exact measurement of time and
could help explain the origins of life.
   Canadian-born Sidney Altman, 50, of Yale University and Thomas
Cech, 41, of the University of Colorado in Boulder, won the
chemistry prize for their ``discovery of catalytic properties of
RNA,'' the citation said.
   Bertil Andersson of the Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences said their work has forced ``the rewrite of
whole chapters'' in chemistry textbooks and could help reveal how
life began.
   It changed dogmas from the turn of the century on how living
cells function, he said.
   The discovery also will ``probably provide a new tool for gene
technology, with potential to create a new defense against viral
infections'' and virus-resistant plants, the academy said.
   Norman F. Ramsey, 74, of Harvard University, was given half the
physics prize for inventing a method for measuring time on which
the current standard of time is based.
   Since 1967, because of Ramsey's discovery, time has been
measured by the movement within the smallest particle of matter
rather than the rotation of Earth. Ingvar Lindgren, chairman of the
awards committee, said the atomic clock deviates by just 1,000th of
a second in 300 years.
   German-born Hans G. Dehmelt, 67, of the University of Washington
in Seattle, and Wolfgang Paul, 76, of the University of Bonn, West
Germany, shared the other half of the $469,000 prize for developing
ways of trapping particles to study a them with extreme precision.
   They realized ``a long-felt dream'' of scientists in the field,
the academy declared.
   Lindgren said the three laureates ``have developed exact methods
of measurement which has made it possible to conduct experiments
that might force us to reconsider some basic physical laws,
especially regarding time and space.''
   Paul heard the news on his car radio and joked later that his
ion trap was an invention ``to measure every speck of dust.'
   ``This is a surprise for me,'' he said. ``I never saw, myself,
the practical relevance of it.''
   Ramsey said at his home in Massechusetts: ``It feels great. I'm
just delighted, and I'm delighted with the people with whom I'm
sharing the prize.''
   Cech was reached in Boston and said: ``I am obviously excited
about it. It was something that everyone has been telling me would
happen, but I had no way of knowing when.''
   Asked about plans for his half of the chemistry prize money, he
replied: ``I have two young daughters who are very good at spending
money.''
   Altman said from New Haven, Conn., ``I'm very happy. I'm very
grateful to all my colleagues and co-workers, teachers and family.''
   Ramsey developed a way to study the structure of atoms by
exciting them to different energy levels, using two oscillating
electromagnetic fields.
   That led to development of the hydrogen maser, a laser-like
device that excites hydrogen atoms and provided the most detailed
determination of their internal structure.
   It has been used to test Albert Einstein's general theory of
relativity and in measuring the continental drift, the academy said.
   Another application was the cesium atomic clock, in which cesium
atoms are excited to higher levels.
   ``I was really studying the fundamental properties of atoms and
nuclei, and ... it was apparent this was a very, very stable
clock,'' Ramsey said. ``It gets used in radio astronomy,
navigation, satellite navigation, many other purposes.''
   Dehmelt and Paul were recognized for developing the technique
for trapping single ions, electrically charged atoms, according to
weight. Lindgren said ``ion traps'' could provide even more exact
time measurement in the future.
   Cech and Altman showed independently that RNA, or ribonucleic
acid, could be a catalyst, or trigger, for chemical reactions in
the cell.
   Their discoveries disproved a 75-year-old dogma that enzymes, or
the triggers of reactions inside cells, are always proteins. They
proved RNA also can be a catalyst, not just the messenger of
genetic codes from DNA, said Andersson, the Nobel committee member.
   When Altman discovered in 1978 that RNA could produce catalytic
reactions in the cell, the discovery was met with disbelief and
``he could hardly believe it himself,'' Andersson said.
   Four years later Cech, demonstrated that the RNA molecule was
not only necessary to the reaction but could trigger the reaction
by itself, without associated proteins previously thought essential.
   Andersson said Cech and Altman worked independently, but ``like
a Ping Pong match, the ball went from one to the other.''
   Their discoveries may provide a method to destroy harmful RNA
molecules that cause infections, such as the common cold, and
eventually also provide cures for hereditary diseases, the academy
said.
   Cech, born in Chicago, has been at Boulder since 1983. He
received his doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley.
   Altman, born in Montreal, earned his doctorate at the University
of Colorado, studied at Harvard and Cambridge and moved to Yale in
1971.
   Ramsey has been at Harvard in Cambridge, Mass., since 1947.
Dehmelt, a U.S. citizen, was born in Goerlitz, now in East Germany,
went to Duke University in North Carolina as a student in 1952 and
has been at the University of Washington in Seattle since 1955.
   Paul was born in Lorenzkirch, Germany and became professor of
experimental physics at Bonn in 1952.
