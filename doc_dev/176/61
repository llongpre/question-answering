   National Broadcasting Co. may sell some radio stations and interests in its radio networks, radio executives said. 

   The moves would follow months of uncertainty over NBC's plans for its radio operations. 
Among other things, talks between NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, and Westinghouse Electric Co. about merging the two company's radio units collapsed late last year, reportedly over accounting issues. 

   NBC operates eight radio stations, three radio networks and a radio programming service. 
Radio executives said NBC now is interested in "reconfiguring" the operations through the possible sale of some stations; purchases of stations; and joint ventures or sales of minority interests in the networks. 

   The radio executives said NBC's plans are the result of continuing reviews of the company's radio operations and aren't related to a Federal Communications Commission review of radio station ownership rules announced earlier this year. 

   The FCC review may affect an agency requirement that NBC sell five of its radio stations by December as part of GE's acquisition last year of NBC's former parent, RCA Corp. NBC, however, has filed with the FCC for an extension of the December deadline because of the agency review. 

   NBC radio officials couldn't be reached for comment on the concern's plans.
