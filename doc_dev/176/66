<MEMO>  (STANFORD CENTENNIAL); Compiled by Don Brignolo. Sources: Newspaper articles
by Tom Philp, April 8, 1987 and David E. Early, Sept. 30, 1990, both Mercury
News staff writers; and "Stanford" magazine, a special issue celebrating
Stanford's centennial, September 1991.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The graduates include U.S. Supreme Court Justices William Rehnquist, Sandra
Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy; "Nightline" host Ted Koppel; John D.
Ehrlichman of Watergate fame; and heart transplant pioneer Norman Shumway.;  
For a century, Stanford has been a place where excellence pumps powerfully
throughout its athletic, social and academic realm.;   Following is a list of
some of Stanford's better known names and accomplishments. But it also
includes names, ideas and ways Stanford may have touched our lives without us
even knowing it.;   (hbox);   One of the most notable graduates was Herbert C.
Hoover, a mining graduate in the class of 1895 and thus one of the first to
complete his four years at Stanford. He founded the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace in 1919. In 1921 he was appointed U.S. Secretary of
Commerce and in 1928 was elected the 31st president of the United States. He
was defeated for re-election as president in 1932 and died in 1964.;   (hbox);
  Stanford was where the IQ was invented in 1916, when Dr. Lewis Terman
published the Stanford-Binet test. A variation of one concocted by French
psychologist Alfred Binet, the Stanford test was for decades the most widely
used IQ test in the United States. Terman's test introduced the term IQ, short
for intelligence quotient.;    (hbox);   The Stanford Blood Bank was the
country's first blood bank to screen all blood for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, and it used a technique devised at the university to do the
testing.;   The testing, which began in 1983, sparked sharp criticism from
other blood banks that Stanford was overreacting to AIDS.;   (hbox);   Former
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher was the invisible hero of the
Iranian hostage crisis. He is credited with negotiating the deal in November
1979 that won 52 American hostages their freedom from a 444-day captivity.;  
(hbox);   The late Ernesto Galarza labored doggedly for Chicano farm workers
before his death in 1986. For more than a decade, the author, diplomat and
scholar led strikes and issued reports on abuses of farm workers that led to
landmark reforms. Finally, in 1964, the San Jose resident won what he
considered a major personal victory when the so-called bracero program was
abolished. Its demise enabled Cesar Chavez to organize farm workers.;  
(hbox);   John Gardner is the founder or chairman of powerful citizen-action
groups, including Common Cause, Independent Sector and the Urban Coalition.;  
(hbox);    BEN Muneta, the grandson of a Navajo medicine man, seeks better
health care for other Native Americans. One of only 24 Navajo physicians, he
is investigating trends in diabetes and risk factors for disease among Native
Americans, who have the highest rates of diabetes of any ethnic group in the
nation.;   (hbox);   The Luque rod was invented by Eduardo Luque to straighten
spinal deformities in children.;   (hbox);   The optacon, which was invented
by John Linvill, scans pages of text and converts the printed page to
Braille.;   (hbox);   Thomas Morrin was director of engineering for the
Stanford Research Institute when, in 1955, he invented the ERMA system to
electronically process bank accounts.;   (hbox);   In 1946, Felix Bloch
discovered nuclear induction, now better known as nuclear magnetic resonance
-- a means of probing atomic nuclei by applying a magnetic field. Bloch, who
joined Stanford's physics department in 1934, won a Nobel Prize in 1952 for
his discovery. His work led to sophisticated medical machines that send a
harmless magnetic field through a body, then trace the movement of molecules
once the field is removed. That trace produces the same image as an X-ray, but
without the damage.;   (hbox);   CARL Djerassi led a team of chemists in
Mexico City who produced the first birth control pill in the late 1950s, three
years before he came to Stanford. The pill was approved for sale in the United
States on May 9, 1960. Later, Djerassi's work at Syntex Research in Palo Alto
earned him enough money to purchase a 1,000-acre ranch near Skyline
Boulevard.;   (hbox);   Ted Danson plays "Sam Malone," one of TV's most
unforgettable characters, in the popular series "Cheers!".;   (hbox);  
Carroll O'Meara was the producer of "The Jack Benny Show.";   (hbox);   EDITH
Head  was one of Hollywood's most famous costume designers.;   (hbox);  
William Dement, the father of sleep research, knows what goes on behind
bedroom doors. In the 28 years he has been at Stanford, Dement has
investigated numerous sleep-related disorders.;   He coined the term REM
sleep, which is short for Rapid Eye Movement, to describe the portion of sleep
when people dream. He discovered REM sleep almost by accident while working
with other researchers at the University of Chicago from 1954 to 1957.;  
(hbox);   Linus Pauling developed his radical theories about Vitamin C during
his period as a professor of chemistry at Stanford. The two-time Nobel Prize
winner became interested in Vitamin C one day in 1966 when bedridden with the
flu. Pauling later published the first papers claiming that Vitamin C could
both cure the common cold and help the body build up its defense system.;  
(hbox);   Robert Cohn is chairman of Octel Communications of Milpitas, makers
of Aspen "voice processing," better known as voice mail.;   (hbox);   While
the British were developing radar with Stanford's klystron tube, the late
Frederick Terman -- who went on to become Stanford vice president, provost and
engineering school dean -- was organizing and directing the Radio Research
Laboratory at Harvard University. Under his leadership, the lab learned how to
foil radar. He was credited with creating "Silicon Valley" and the Stanford
Research Center.;   (hbox);   Two of Frederick Terman's students, David
Packard and Bill Hewlett, who were fishing buddies, started a company in a
garage in 1939; their creation became a high-tech giant.;   (hbox);   THE late
William Shockley, a Nobel laureate, was the co-inventor of the transistor --
the backbone of modern electronics. He helped to develop the first transistor
in 1948, while at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey, and won a Nobel
Prize for the work in 1956, the year he started teaching at Stanford.;  
(hbox);   Among Stanford's most prominent graduates are U.S. Supreme Court
Justices William Rehnquist, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy.;  
(hbox);   Jess Oppenheimer is the man who created and produced "I Love Lucy.";
  (hbox);   Professor Norman Shumway directed the United States' first human
heart transplant at Stanford on Jan. 6, 1968. The patient, 54-year-old
steelworker Mike Kasperak, died 14 days later. Later, Professor Vaughn Starnes
performed a breakthrough lung transplant.;   (hbox);   Edward Teller's work
with the thermonuclear research program of the Los Alamos National Laboratory
led to the first successful hydrogen bomb explosion on Nov. 1, 1952. This work
earned him the title of father of the H-bomb.;   (hbox);   HENRY Kaplan
managed to save a boy's vision in 1956 with a machine that looked like a
cannon. It was the nation's first medical linear accelerator, and its
high-voltage energy could reach cancerous tissue that X-rays could not.;  
(hbox);   Stanford was the first to discover how to treat hemophilia, a
genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting. In 1965, Dr. Judith Pool
developed a technique to extract the clotting factor, antihemophilic globulin,
from blood.;   (hbox);   Frustrated by watching sick newborn babies die
enroute to hospitals, two Stanford professors developed the first transport
incubator in 1978. Within a year, 15,000 newborn babies had been rushed to
hospitals throughout the United States and Europe in the incubators, developed
by Dr. Alvin Hackel and mechanical engineering Professor Robert J. Moffat.;  
(hbox);   The first scientific research into the design of airplane and ship
propellers was by Stanford's William Durand. He helped found the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1915 and supervised the construction of
its first wind tunnel, built at Stanford in 1918.;   In 1941, at the age of
82, Durand was appointed to head a NACA committee to study German activity in
rocket propulsion. The committee proposed research that led to the first U.S.
turboprop and turbojet engines.;   (hbox);   STANFORD started the nation's
first high-tech business park in 1951, when Varian Associates signed a lease
before moving in two years later. Other companies -- Eastman Kodak, General
Electric, Preformed Line Products, Admiral Corp., Shockley Transistor
Laboratory of Beckman Instruments, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. -- soon to be followed by Stanford Industrial Park, now
known as Stanford Research Park.;   (hbox);   Pupils at Brentwood Elementary
School in East Palo Alto were the first in the nation to learn by computer.;  
Stanford professors Pat Suppes and Richard Atkinson demonstrated their
computerized math and reading lessons on Aug. 26, 1966. Students answered
computer questions by touching a special pen to the screen.;   (hbox);   The
"mouse" that moves the cursor on the Apple Macintosh is a very old animal.
Douglas Engelbart developed the first mouse in 1964 at Stanford Research
Institute.;   (hbox);   CLELIA Duel Mosher transferred to Stanford from the
University of Wisconsin in fall 1892. She brought with her the beginnings of
what would become a 28-year study of female sexuality. It pre-dated Kinsey by
50 years and attempted to debunk the popular notion that Victorian women were
passionless and disinterested in sex. Mosher found that women desired sex,
enjoyed it and experienced orgasms.;   (hbox);   In 1908 a drunken student
returned to campus late and stumbled into the wrong house. Mistaken for a
burglar, he was shot and killed by another student. The Academic Council
adopted a campus ban on liquor and promised to expel any student guilty of
drunkenness. Hundreds of students marched in protest, but the school did not
budge. Twelve students were suspended and others required to take extra units
to graduate.;   (hbox);   A more recent tragedy: Doctoral candidate Theodore
Streleski used a hammer on Aug. 18, 1978, to bludgeon to death Professor Karel
deLeeuw in his campus office. Streleski had been working for 19 years trying
to get his advanced degree from the department. He served seven years and 20
days in prison, rejecting parole three times so he could be released
unconditionally. When freed, Streleski said he had no remorse over his crime
and that he could not guarantee he would not kill again. It is believed he
still lives in the Bay Area.  </TEXT>
