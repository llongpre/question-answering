   Emerson Radio Corp. reported net losses for its fiscal third quarter and nine months, ended Dec. 31, and said it expects another loss for the current quarter. 

   The North Bergen, N.J.-based consumer electronics concern had a third-period loss of $102,000, compared with net income of $9.3 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. 
The most recent quarter included a $201,000 net loss from early retirement of long-term debt. 
Sales in the quarter dropped 7.5% to $200.7 million from $217 million. 

   President Stephen L. Lane said, "We don't anticipate the fourth quarter to be in the black. 
We confidently expect a return to profitability to commence with our new fiscal year beginning April 1." 

   The company has reduced inventory in the past six months, he said. 
"As a result, we have been able to stem the tide of losses experienced over the first six months of the fiscal year." 

   For the nine months, the company posted a net loss of $11.5 million, compared with profit of $25 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Nine-month sales dipped 3% to $599.7 million from $617.3 million.
