   Some human cancers may be caused by energy
fields created by electrical flows down power lines and through
ordinary home appliances, an Environmental Protection Agency report
says.
   The report reviewing more than 40 scientific studies, still in
preliminary form and not yet assessed by outside experts, says the
evidence implicating 60-cycle magnetic fields from ordinary AC
current is suggestive but inconclusive.
   ``With our current understanding, we can identify 60 Hertz
magnetic fields from power lines and perhaps other sources in the
home as a possible, but not proven, cause of cancer in people,''
said the report, made available by the agency on Friday.
   Electromagnetic fields are created any time electrical power
flows through a circuit in an appliance or a power line. Common
household electromagnetic radiation is also associated with such
appliances as television sets, microwave ovens and radio
transmitters.
   The EPA report on low-frequency and radio frequency fields said
the strongest evidence that exposure to electromagnetic fields ``is
casually related to human cancer'' comes from studies of children
who lived near electrical power transmission lines, or who were the
offspring of parents who worked in electrical occupations.
   ``These studies have consistently found modestly elevated risks
(some statistically significant) of leukemia, cancer of the nervous
system and, to a lesser extent, lymphomas (a cancer of the
lymphatic system, such as Hodgkin's disease),'' the report said.
   Some of the studies cited are more than a decade old.
   The report said there was ``weaker'' evidence of an increased
risk of leukemia and other cancers for adults in occupations where
exposure to electromagnetic fields are common. It said the
occupational studies come from sources that are ``sketchy'', but
the report notes, ``Despite these weaknesses the occupational
studies tend to support the results of the childhood cancer
studies.''
   Studies on the effects of radio frequency radiation, such as
from transmitters or wireless telephones phones, were inconclusive,
though the report said that ``statistically significant'' levels of
leukemia among amateur radio operators requires further examination.
   The report said laboratory animal studies show there are a
number biological effects from electromagnetic fields, but it is
not clear how these effects could lead to cancer. These effects
include changes in the replication of the genetic material of cells
and changes in cell division.
   However, the report notes, ``In view of these laboratory
studies, there is reason to believe that the findings of
carcinogenicity in humans are biologically plausible.''
   The report said that further study is needed, with specific
attention to dose levels and characteristics of electromagnetic
radiation, before a firm conclusion could be drawn about the cancer
effects.
   At least 22 studies, many of them nearing completion, are
exploring various aspects of how electromagnetic radiation
generated by the flow of electricity or from radio transmitters
could cause cancer, the report said.
