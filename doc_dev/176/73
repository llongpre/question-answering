  [Text] The government has authorized opening another two 
radio stations, raising to four the total of radio stations 
already licensed. They are all based in Maputo. A source from 
the Information Ministry told Radio Mozambique that the two last 
authorized stations are: RTK [Klint Radio and Television] 
belonging to businessman Carlos Klint and Radio Projeccao owned 
by businessman Jose Custodio. 
  Earlier, two other radio stations had been authorized to 
operate. One is Radio Miramar which, according to sources 
contacted by our correspondent, is thought to be linked to the 
Kingdom of God Universal Church. The other station is Radio FM 
headed by journalist Suleiman Cabir. The Information Ministry 
source added that two other applications may soon be authorized. 
One is for Radio Encontro, which will be operated by the 
Nampula Archdiocese, and the other is Coop Radio, to be operated 
by a firm that will have Coop Imagem and the Golo advertising 
company as shareholders. Well known journalists and radio 
professionals such as Leite de Vasconcelos, Carlos Silva, and 
Antonio Fonseca are linked to this project. 
  An application to open a radio station by the Machava Sacred 
Family Parish in the outskirts of Maputo may also be authorized 
soon. Our correspondent reports that a group of youths from 
Nampula, headed by Carlitos Jafar has also applied for the 
opening of yet another television station.
