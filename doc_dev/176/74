  [Excerpts] There is no question of talks between the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front and the putschist government, as some 
media -- such as Radio Kigali and RTLM [Radio-Television Libre 
des Mille Collines]-- have reported. In fact, Radio Kigali and 
Radio RTLM [words indistinct] the clique of extremists have 
spoken of negotiations this Tuesday in Arusha between the RPF 
and a government delegation. Meanwhile, BBC radio, in its 
Swahili-language evening news bulletin, also mentioned talks 
between the two sides -- the RPF and the Rwandan Government. 
(?You should remember) that the information was announced by 
the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry spokesman. All this information 
is [words indistinct]. The RPF has always been [word 
indistinct] -- there is no question of negotiations with a 
clique of extremist (?murderers) who (?are responsible for the 
blood) of innocent people. [passage omitted] The RPF therefore 
prefers not to hold negotiations between the RPF and a putschist 
government delegation. 
  [(Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda at 1815 
GMT on 1 May broadcasts the following: 
  ["In response to reports by Radio Rwanda, Radio-Television 
Libre des Mille Collines--and even BBC--that there will be a 
ceasefire negotiation between RPF and the Government of Rwanda 
on Tuesday [3 May] in Tanzania, RPF wishes to make it clear that 
there has been no such arrangements on the part of RPF. The RPF 
has no intentions to and will never negotiate any ceasefire with 
the illegitimate and self-imposed government in Rwanda. The RPF 
maintains its earlier position that it can only negotiate a 
ceasefire with the Rwanda Government forces if they so wish. 
Thank you."]
