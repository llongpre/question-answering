LAST WEEK, Radio 3's play alternated the 15th century and the 20th. This
week's, Adam Thorpe's Offa's Daughter, is set in the 9th, though Offa, King
of Mercia, lives in the 8th, from AD 757 to 796. But it is his daughter
Eadburgh we deal with, following her from youth to age. She married, and
murdered, Offa's dependent, the King of Wessex, lacing his goblet with
powdered glass - not intending it for him but for his vassal Felix. When we
meet her in old-age, she is taken for a beggar, her robes and finery all
gone but for a gold ring bearing Offa's likeness.
At Pavia, in Lombardy, she encounters Brother Edward, whom she had known in
Mercia, in charge of a scroll to be carried back there. This actually
happens at the start of the play; the rest of the tale is told to Edward to
win his sympathy. Only one thing matters to her now, to get her faithful
servant Theya, into comfort and clean linen, as she promised when they were
young.
So once again we have these time-shifts, with characters spliced at
different ages. Director Jeremy Mortimer has a useful company: Eadburgh, who
is Sian Phillips at Pavia, is Tara Fitzgerald in her flighty period, an
effective amalgam. Mature Edward is Richard Johnson; Linus Roache his
younger counterpart; Melanie Hudson the servant Theya, who clearly models
herself on her mistress. I have to confess that I do not much like
time-split plays. As listeners wrote to Christopher Dunkley's Feedback last
week, the association of voice with character is one of radio's principal
requisites, and it is a great help if the character remains constant.
Ronald Harwood's The Dresser (Radio 4, Monday) provided a total contrast. It
presents, from offstage, a performance of King Lear, in a provincial theatre
in wartime, played by a touring company under an ageing actor known only as
'Sir'. There is never any doubt about what is going on or who is speaking.
The action is mostly in Sir's dressing-room; as Sir is played by Freddie
Jones (who gave it in the West End in 1980) and his eponymous dresser is
Michael Palin, in his first venture into radio drama, the clarity is ideal.
Adaptation and direction are both by David Blount.
It is not a great play, but very enjoyable, and certainly authentic, for the
author was dresser to Sir Donald Wolfit (who, he insists, was not the model
for Sir). Sir has collapsed on the day of his Lear, and the action covers
the efforts of Norman, his dresser, to restore him to form and see him
through the play whenever there are troubles. Sundry incidents involving
Sir's wife and the theatre company are all resolved by Norman's inventive
loyalty.
Yet Sir dies in his dressing-room after the play, and Norman shows a
touching mixture of affection and resentment at the old actor's ingratitude
for long service.
What with a new biography and a memorial tablet in Poets' Corner, Anthony
Trollope is still with us. Last week Radio 4 began six Wednesday talks by
Richard Mullen, not biography but study of Trollope's reactions to various
facets of his time. The first was about marriage, in which he was involved
fairly early, and this week's dealt with Ireland, where he lived for many
years. Extra liveliness was added by Paul Rogers's playing as Trollope.
Worth following.
