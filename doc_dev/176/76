<HEAD>EC Opens Dumping Inquiry on South Korean Car Radios</HEAD>

   The European Community's executive
commission Tuesday opened an anti-dumping inquiry into car radio
imports from South Korea after receiving a complaint from an
industry group.
   The anti-dumping complaint was brought by the Association for
Legal-Auto Radio Measures, comprised of major European
manufacturers Philips NV, Grundig AG, and Blaupunkt-Werke GmbH.
   The group, which makes more than 70 percent of EC-made car
radios, said that by forcing EC car radio prices down, the South
Korean exporters had caused considerable profit cuts and job cuts
among EC manufacturers.
   According to the complaint, 5.8 million South Korean car radios
were sold in the 12-nation trade bloc in 1988, up from 1.7 million
in 1985, raising South Korea's market share to 32 percent from 14
percent.
   The EC manufacturers' share in their own market fell during the
same period to 33 percent from 49 percent.
   If the South Korean companies are found to have been dumping car
radios on the European market at prices lower than at home, the EC
can impose retaliatory duties on their car radio exports.
   In a statement, the commission said a comparison between
internal South Korean prices for car radios and prices charged for
comparable exports to the EC showed that ``the alleged dumping
margins are important.''
   The South Korean concerns named in the complaint are Sinbang
Electronics Co.; Korea Electronics Co.; Osio Electronics Co.;
Carspec Electronics Co.; Sunkyong Limited; Woojin Electric Co.;
Tongkook Electronics Co.; Hyundai Electronics Co.; Daewoo
Corporation; Haitai International Inc.; Sherwood (Inkel), Dongwon
Electronics Co.; Samsung Electronics Co.; and Shindong Electronics
Co.
