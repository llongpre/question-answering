  [Text] Radio News will begin work soon, Mr. [Mohammad] 
Hashemi, head of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Voice and Vision 
[radio and television], announced this morning in a gathering of 
personnel from the Voice and Vision's public relations office. 
He added: Radio News will begin work on the occasion of the 
blessed 10 Days of Dawn [anniversary of the revolution during 
the first ten days of February]. 
  Mr. Hashemi said with regards to the need for the creation 
of 
Radio News: Because news tends to be generated constantly and 
because current bulletins are broadcast at specific times, Radio 
News was felt to be needed, and work on the planning and 
implementation was set into motion. As a result, this radio 
will begin work soon. 
  According to this report, Radio News will broadcast three to 
five minutes of political, economic, sports, scientific, and 
cultural news every 15 minutes. Radio News will broadcast 
between 0630 in the morning and 2100. 
  The Voice and Vision chief added: At the beginning, Radio 
News will be received within the boundaries of greater Tehran; 
efforts will be made to increase its range in the future. Our 
aim is that much of the news we cannot use in current bulletins 
because of time limitations will be broadcast on this radio 
station for the information of our compatriots.
