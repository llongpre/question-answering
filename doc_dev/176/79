   A battle over America's industrial future
is being fought in this Chicago suburb, where the nation's last
major manufacturer of televisions is under siege from Wall Street.
   The struggle for Zenith Electronics Corp. is being watched
closely by Washington, Silicon Valley and foreign capitals because
of what it could mean for the future of the United States in high
technology.
   Two New Yorkers who ordinarily specialize in stock market
speculation are asking Zenith shareholders to decide by Dec. 4
whether to dump the company's chief executive from the board of
directors and install them.
   The Wall Street arbitragers say they want to get rid of Zenith's
money-losing television business. If they win, they will seek a
buyer for the TV business or if necessary sell the whole company,
which includes a successful personal computer division.
   The challenge by Brookhurst Partners comes, ironically, at the
very time many experts are saying the United States needs to have a
home-based TV manufacturing industry as a matter of national
competitiveness _ if not national pride.
   An emerging theory says the sharp, bright televisions of the
1990s will be so crammed with advanced electronics that the United
States must keep its hand in the business or fall to second-rate
status in entire fields of electronics.
   High-definition television, so called for the striking clarity of
its picture, will have 1,000 to 1,250 horizontal lines on a screen,
twice the current number, permitting vivid color and sharp detail.
Worldwide sales could hit $40 billion a year in the coming decade.
   Right now, Japan is far ahead.
   ``High-definition TV has become a symbol of a much larger issue,
which is whether the U.S. is going to lose control of the driving
forces of economic growth for the first time since Henry Ford
invented the modern assembly line,'' argues Fred Branfman, director
of Rebuild America, a group that favors government-industry
partnerships.
   It is hard at first to swallow the argument that televisions _
the boxes that bring us ``Wheel of Fortune'' _ are vital to national
security. But Americans have begun to learn what the Japanese always
knew, that success in exotic technology depends on having a solid
base in household items.
   Consumer electronics give Japanese companies invaluable
experience in making things small, reliable, easy to use and
inexpensive, lessons they apply to invading such American
strongholds as mainframe computers.
   Although consumer electronics is not a high-profit business, it
is so large that Japan, with half the U.S. population, has surpassed
the United States in consumption of computer chips.
   In the electronics business, size is strength. The South Koreans
and Taiwanese, among others, are following Japan's bigger-is-better
strategy as they pile up trade surpluses with the United States.
   Zenith by itself is not all that important. In spite of its
illustrious history, it is only the world's 13th largest color TV
maker, tied with a Finnish company called Nokia Corp.
   But if Zenith cannot make it in televisions, it is not clear what
American company can. Zenith, after all, has a famous brand name,
strong relations with retailers, and the advantage of already being
in the business.
   For an outsider, jumping into the TV business would be like
trying to hop onto a speeding train. That explains why giants such
as International Business Machines Corp. have not started making TVs
in spite of their public statements about the importance of a U.S.
presence in the industry.
   Should a big U.S. company other than Zenith gear up a factory to
make the next generation of televisions?
   ``For the good of the country, yes. For the good of their
shareholders, no. The stock would go straight down,'' said Stephen
Balog, an electronics analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Standing up for Zenith is Jerry K. Pearlman, 49, the chairman,
president and chief executive, a 17-year veteran of the 70-year-old
company who is looking for ways to return its TV business to
profitability in spite of cutthroat foreign competition.
   With deliberate vagueness, Pearlman says possibilities under
discussion include types of cooperation such as sharing factory
space with other companies, selling other companies' products under
Zenith labels, and selling Zenith products under other labels.
   Opposing Pearlman are the partners of Brookhurst, Herbert B.
Abelow, 54, and Nicholas L. Ihasz, 44, who fled Hungary with his
family after Soviet troops quashed an uprising in 1956.
   Abelow and Ihasz are being cast as villains by the Zenith forces,
but they say they are simply asking the shareholders _ the company's
true owners _ what they think should be done with the company.
   ``I come from a communist country. I think owning shares is like
having the right to vote,'' Ihasz said. ``This is the most
democratic process I can think of.''
   Life was simpler in 1918, when two wireless radio enthusiasts
named R.H.G. Mathews and Karl Hassel began making sets on a kitchen
table in Chicago for what would become Zenith.
   Among those who used Zenith's early radios were King Alexander I
of Yugoslavia and Donald B. MacMillan, the Arctic explorer. Zenith
began making televisions in 1948 and became famous for its slogan:
``The quality goes in before the name goes on.''
   By the early '60s the Asian invasion of consumer electronics was
well under way. There were 27 U.S.-based TV makers in 1960, 18 in
1968, nine in 1974, five in 1984 and two in 1987, according to a
countdown by IEEE Spectrum, a magazine for electrical engineers.
