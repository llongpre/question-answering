   Lawrence A. ``Pat'' Hyland, the former
head of Hughes Aircraft Co. whose inventions helped pioneer radar
technology and aircraft communications, died Friday. He was 92.
   Hyland died at Antelope Valley Hospital, where he had been
admitted Tuesday following a heart attack, Hughes spokesman Bill
Herrman said.
   Hyland served as vice president and chief executive officer at
Hughes from 1954 to 1976. He was named the aerospace firm's
president and chairman of the board after founder Howard Hughes
died in 1976.
   Throughout, however, Hyland ran the company. He retired in 1984,
assuming the title of chairman emeritus, and continued to work out
of his office several times a week.
   Under Hyland's tenure, Hughes grew from a modest producer of
airborne fire control systems to the nation's largest defense
electronics company and a leading builder of communications
satellites.
   Hyland held an early patent that contributed to the development
of radio detection and imaging, or radar, which bounces radio
signals off distant objects to determine their location.
   Hyland was born in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on Aug.
26, 1897, and came with his family to the United States at the age
of 2.
   He served as a sergeant in the U.S. Army Field Artillery during
World War I, receiving five battle stars for his service with the
Second Division in France He joined the U.S. Navy, where he worked
as a chief radioman between 1920 and 1926 and helped demonstrate a
blind landing system for aircraft.
   In 1926 he joined the Naval Research Laboratory as a radio
engineer and, in 1932, demonstrated the reflection of radio waves
from aircraft.
   Hyland held other patents that enabled aircraft to communicate
with each other and with the ground via radio and to determine
their altitude during blind landings. Many of his developments were
adopted in standard aircraft electronics systems.
   Hyland founded Radio Research Co. in Washington, D.C. in 1932,
heading the firm until it merged into Bendix Corp. five years
later. During a 17-year tenure with Bendix he became vice president
in charge of engineering before leaving to join Hughes.
   Hyland is survived by his wife, Muriel, and a daughter.
