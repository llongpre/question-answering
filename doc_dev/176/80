  [Text] Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, the head of the Voice and 
Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran [radio and television 
organization -- IRIB], today addressed the seminar of the heads 
of news sections in IRIB's provincial centers. He said: The 
truth-seeking minds throughout the world are the targets and 
recipients of the message of the Islamic revolution. By playing 
a more active role in the international system of information, 
we will try to respond to cultural needs. 
  The head of IRIB then referred to the rapid global 
developments in the sphere of communications and information 
during the present era when technology is enjoying progress and 
the nations are awakening. He said: In view of the nations' 
growing inclination towards Islam and idealism, the present 
cultural vacuum and the intellectual crisis felt across the 
world, and finally the vast amount of propaganda against the 
Islamic system, it is clear that the responsibilities of the 
radio and television, as the largest media, are very grave. 
  He stressed that IRIB enjoyed potential talents and 
capabilities which could be utilized in a more efficient way so 
as to expand the sphere of present activities. He then said 
that the operation of the 3d [TV] network and the Radio News 
were part of the new efforts aimed at accelerating the process 
of news and information broadcasting, and filling the society's 
leisure time. 
  According to our correspondent's report, today's meeting 
continued with an address by Mr Hemmati, the deputy head of IRIB 
in charge of political affairs. He referred to the change in 
attitudes towards radio and television, and underlined the 
inevitable need to change the system of news broadcasting in 
order to create a greater momentum in the society, strengthen 
incentives and mobilize the population to participate in the 
reconstruction process. 
  He said: By reliance on its high level of expertise and 
capabilities, IRIB has formulated new plans for expanding field 
information gathering and broadcasting. He added: With the 
start of the Radio News, which will begin transmission during 
the blessed 10-day Fajr celebrations [the anniversary of the 
victory of Islamic revolution on 11 Feb 1979], the necessary 
means for speedy and regular transmission of news will be 
provided. 
  According to IRIB's deputy in charge of political affairs, 
the Radio News programs will be varied, and will cover sports, 
scientific, cultural, arts, economic, social and political news 
from Iran and abroad. He added: With the operation of this 
station, the people will be given more details on latest news 
and information.
