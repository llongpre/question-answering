<LEADPARA>  The guardians of the famed Electronics Museum at Foothill College are packing
more than 10,000 historic electronic gadgets for the museum's move from the
Los Altos Hills campus.;    The museum doesn't have a new home yet, so the
collection may have to go into storage. But the collection must be moved out
by Sept. 15 -- the date settled upon after a bitter legal battle between the
museum and the Foothill-De Anza Community College District.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GETTING READY FOR A MOVE - INTO LIMBO?
ELECTRONICS MUSEUM PACKS UP
IT MUST VACATE CAMPUS SITE AND IS SEEKING
A NEW HOME  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Volunteers are helping the museum people catalog and pack some of the most
priceless hardware fashioned by the men and women who created Silicon Valley,
including the electron tube that Lee De Forest used to create the first radio,
early spark-gap transmitters and battery-powered radio receivers, and the
first audio oscillator, an electronic measuring instrument that was fashioned
in a Palo Alto garage by Bill Hewlett and David Packard. More volunteers are
needed.;    "Workers have the chance to see and work with historic electronics
industry artifacts from Silicon Valley, many of which have never been put on
public display before they were placed in storage," said Jim Weldon, vice
president of the Perham Foundation, a non-profit organization that operates
the museum.;    George Durfey, a member of the foundation's board of
directors, said the organization still is exploring sites for the collection,
including the old Southern Pacific railroad station in Los Altos, the Museum
of American Heritage in Palo Alto and Kelley Park in San Jose.;    The move is
the result of a 14-month legal struggle with the Foothill-De Anza Community
College District, which wanted the museum to leave so the space could be used
for classrooms. The foundation, however, wanted to retain the collection and
be paid for the money it raised to build the museum.;    In January, Santa
Clara County Superior Court Judge Jeremy Fogel settled the dispute in a ruling
he called a compromise, calling on the college district to pay $775,000 to the
museum's trust to move out the electronics collection by Sept. 15. The college
district then can use the present museum space for classrooms and recoup the
costs through additional enrollment.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The museum
seeks volunteers to work any time from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through
Saturdays in July and August. Anyone interested may call Jim Weldon at (415)
595-4456 or George Durfey at (415) 854-4041.  </TEXT>
