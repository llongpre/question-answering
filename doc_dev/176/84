  [Abstract] During the 1984-92 period the Institute of Radio 
Engineering and Electronics at the Russian Academy of Sciences 
intensified research in the field of quantum electronics, the 
three main areas being: 
1) fiber- optics technology, 
2) laser materials and devices, 
3) spectroscopy based on nuclear-magnetic resonance or on 
luminescence. 
  In the first area have been for the first time developed: 
a) a method of extruding single-mode fibers with sheaths made of 
fluorine-doped quartz glass for 1.3-1.55 Êm infrared light 
b) a new technology for producing anisotropic single-mode fibers 
which maintain the polarization and the intensity of light with 
minimal losses 
c) a laboratory technology for producing single-mode fibers 
which transmit 1.3 Êm light with an only 0.7 dB/km maximum 
loss 
d) a method of welding together different fibers with an only 
0.5 dB loss per joint. In addition to improvement of the 
extruding apparatus, there have been developed a plasmochemical 
variant of vertical lateral deposition for glass-forming oxides 
with use of organometallic compounds as initial reactants, a 
method of producing large-aperture fibers, a method of producing 
low-loss multimode fibers. A new method of forming anisotropic 
``bow tie'' fibers, with the aid of thermal shields, has been 
proposed and demonstrated. A high magnetic susceptibility of 
single-mode fibers has been attained by use of using rare-earth 
elements as dopants. For the first time has been developed a 
tubeless method of lateral deposition of thin fluorosilicate 
sheaths on quartz rods in a microwave plasma. Jointly with the 
Institute of Optical Physics and the Scientific Research 
Institute of Electrical Systems at the Ministry of Electrical 
Industry have been produced radiation-resistant power fibers, 
radiation-resistant and mechanically strong single-mode and 
multimode fibers, thick fiber strands for optical cables, and 
large-aperture low-loss fibers doped with various rare-earth 
elements as well as large-aperture quartz-quartz fibers for 
transmitting up to 500 W of laser radiation power with 80% 
efficiency. Other developments include deposition of polymer 
sheaths, new silicon elastomers for fiber coatings which will 
ensure at least 99% transmission, and a cryogenic 
microcable 
for temperatures from 80ÎC down to -60ÎC. Theoretical 
studies have yielded a theory of microflexure and a new model of 
hydrolytic fracture of quartz fibers. New apparatus with 
fiber-optic components for measuring physical quantities and 
methods of doing it have also been developed, the components 
including fiber thermooptic channel switches, Fourier analyzers, 
a random-access memory, polarizers, light modulators, two-mode 
reflectometers, directional couplers, temperature and magnetic 
field transducers. Work has furthermore been done on several 
practical applications of fiber-optic technology. In the area of 
laser materials and devices there have been developed a method 
of hardening phosphate glass, a new Cr-Y-Er glass for 
heat-resistant minilasers and high-efficiency low- threshold 
quatrons, a 1.5 Êm Er-minilaser suitable for a record high 7 
Hz pulse repetition rate, borate glass activated with Yb and Er. 
There also have for the first time been achieved parametric 
resonance emission of ultraviolet picosecond pulses and 
continuous high-efficiency emission by Nd ions. Other new 
developments include powder lasers (Nd-ion implanted in powders 
of La oxide or oxysulfide, binary Na, La, Ba, or Gd chromate- 
molybdate, La-Sr niobate, and Ga-Yb sulfide with Nd impurity), a 
new kind of mirrors using resonant metal screens for optically 
pumped lasers, a highly long-time stable 
CO[.sub]2[/]-OsO[.sub]4[/], and diffusely reflecting 
coatings (aluminum, fused quartz, phosphate glass) for laser 
reflectors, also a new method of hardening phosphate glass for 
active media and a new method of welding together glasses 
containing chromium. The feasibility of producing fibers for 
high-efficiency transmission of infrared light has been proposed 
on the basis of theoretical analysis and then demonstrated 
experimentally on fibers transmitting 1.5 Êm at an average 
power of 2 W with an up to 30 % efficiency. With 
low-energy 
ultraviolet lasers, efficient frequency conversion by stimulated 
Raman scattering has been achieved in a multipass vessel 
containing methane under a pressure of 30 atm. Research was done 
on both electron-magnetic resonance and nuclear- magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy, studies of the latter having revealed a 
``cascade'' narrowing of the NMR spectra owing to concurrent 
action of a strong radio-frequency field and slow molecular 
movements in solids. As to generators of electromagnetic 
signals, there have been developed microminiature microwave 
vacuum devices including solid-state oscillators such as 
transistors, avalanche diodes, and Gunn-effect diodes. More than 
80 scientific articles have been published during that period.
