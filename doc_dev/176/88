  [Text] The Information Technology Society in the Frankfurt 
League of German Electrical Engineers (ITG) regards digital 
mobile radio as a significant improvement in the position of 
Germany and Europe. They note that the Germans, in particular, 
not only played an essential role in the development of the new 
"Global System for Mobile Communication" (GSM) standard, but 
they were also in the vanguard in the development of the GSM 
mobile radio net. They also claim that a large percentage of 
Federal German territory is already equipped with radio stations 
for the D1 and D2 nets which use the GSM standard. By 1995, 95 
percent of the territory should be included. 
  GSM is the prerequisite for mobile telephoning without 
borders: 28 countries, including the CIS, China and Australia, 
want to install GSM radio nets over the next few years. When 
that has happened anyone within these countries who has a GSM 
mobile phone can access the net and place or receive a call. 
  The technical prerequisite for the compatibility of the 
individual national networks is the GSM standard set by ETSI 
(European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute). It 
defines the processing of the digital signals at the interface, 
the division of the frequency band into channels, modulation and 
coding as well as the functions of the fixed radio stations and 
their regulation. In Germany these technical requirements were 
met with the activation of the D1 net. ETSI standardization is 
converted into the national standard by the German Electronics 
Commission in the DIN and the VDE (DKE). 
  Software for the complex GSM systems runs on supercomputers 
which in turn must be incorporated into the net. The nets are 
constructed in such a way that in the signal area every radio 
station can reach a maximum number of subscribers simultaneously 
by mobile telephone. This is achieved by data reduction and by 
optimal utilization of the frequency bands by multiplex 
processing. The 137 frequencies in the 900-megaHertz band 
alloted to the GSM can each be utilized by eight subscribers. By 
multiple utilization of the frequencies at various points on the 
net an almost unlimited subscriber capacity is achieved. In the 
opinion of VDE-ITG, demands on mobile communications systems 
will continue to grow. Intelligent network functions will have 
to be developed for current nets in order to introduce a unified 
worldwide call number. Only then can the goal of "universal 
personal communication" be realized. Every subscriber should be 
able to access the network on any continent by card or telephone 
and be able to receive calls using the same call number in any 
country. By the year 2005 the European "Universal Mobile 
Telecommunication System" should be using an integrated system 
to provide the services of mobile radio nets which today exist 
side by side. Comparable efforts are being undertaken worldwide 
with the objective of creating a "Future Public Land Mobile 
Telecommunication System."
