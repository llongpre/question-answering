  [Abstract] A medical radio-tomograph is 
proposed. The tomograph is designed for active selective 
diagnostics in conjunction with frequent therapy of internal 
organs in the millimeter to decimeter wave range. Its 
functioning is based on combining the principles of selective 
holography with adaptive location. The methodology of microwave 
nonlinear tomography, based on methods of contrasting 
substances, a priory radio- testing and adaptive self-focusing 
of radio-illumination is described. A diagram of the 
radio-tomograph is provided and the algorithm of its functioning 
is also described. Implementation of the proposed scientific 
principles and engineering solutions would improve the spacial 
resolution, the contrast range, and the information content of 
radio-holograms; expand the spectrum of applications (biomedical 
diagnostics, selective analysis and thermal processing, 
non-invasive defectoscopy etc); and increase the diagnostic and 
therapeutic capacities of the radio-tomograph (additional 
diagnostic information, focused treatment or heating of the 
internal organs, etc). Figure 1, references 14: Russian.
