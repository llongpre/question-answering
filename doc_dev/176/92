   Mel Blanc, ``The Man of A Thousand Voices,''
including the legions of Looney Tune stars such as Porky Pig, Daffy
Duck, Tweety Pie and that mischievously silly wabbit Bugs Bunny, has
died. He was 81.
   The originator of such lines as Bugs' ``Eh, what's up, Doc?,''
Sylvester the Cat's ``Thufferin' thuccotash!,'' and Porky's
``Th-th-th-that's all, folks'' died Monday from complications from
heart disease and other ailments.
   By his own count, Blanc estimated he had mastered at least 900
different accents and dialects during a career spanning more than 50
years.
   Working in an age without high-tech sound effects, Blanc was a
human synthesizer, a verbal computer. It has been estimated that
more than 20 million people hear his voices daily.
   He invented the voices of such characters as Woody Woodpecker,
Speedy Gonzalez, Pepe Le Pew, Tasmanian Devil, Road Runner, Foghorn
Leghorn, Heathcliffe the cat, Speed Buggy, Yosemite Sam and that
Oscar-winning rabbit Bugs Bunny.
   He also did voices for the Roadrunner and numerous other
characters on 850 cartoons for Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes and Merrie
Melodies.
   He was the babbling Barney Rubble and the hyperactive, yammering
Dino, Fred Flintstone's pet dinosaur on the popular Hanna-Barbera
series; Mr. Spacely on ``The Jetsons'' and the Frito Bandito.
   ``Those voices were part of him, and he loved every moment of
it,'' said Blanc's son, Noel. ``When the kids would come to the door
or in the studio, he became those characters.''
   His final cartoon contribution came with 1988's popular
animation-live action film, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' in which he
did the voices of Daffy, Tweety, Bugs and Sylvester.
   The film's director, Robert Zemeckis, called Blanc a man ``whose
talent transcended all ages and broke through to the child in all of
us.''
   Longtime friend Mickey Rooney said: ``The reservoir of Hollywood
legends is extremely low, and Mel Blanc's passing is a deep personal
loss.''
   Born in San Francisco on May 30, 1908, and raised in Portland,
Ore., Blanc discovered his vocal skills while in grammar school.
   He started his career in 1927 as a musician and radio perfomer.
   In 1928, Blanc _ who played the bass, violin and sousaphone _ was
hired by the NBC Radio Orchestra in San Francisco.
   In 1937, he joined Warner Bros.' cartoon studio, which produced
one short feature subject each week.
   His first Warner character was a drunken bull in the Looney Tunes
short ``Picador Porky.'' As legend has it, the actor playing Porky
in that short did stutter. A few months later, Blanc took over in
``Porky's Duck Hunt,'' stuttering intact, and created Daffy Duck.
   Blanc introduced Bugs in the 1940 short ``A Wild Hare,'' giving
the character a combination Bronx and Brooklyn accent. Bugs won an
Oscar in 1958 for ``Nighty Night Bugs.''
   Elmer Fudd, the frustrated hunter who could neither catch Bugs
Bunny nor pronounce his ``R's'', was one of the few Warner Bros.
cartoon voices that wasn't created by Blanc. It was first done by
Arthur O. Bryan, but Blanc took over the voice in 1959 when Bryan
died.
   Blanc eventually became known as ``The Man of a Thousand
Voices.'' But the most Warner ever paid him was $20,000, and the
studio retained rights to the phrases Blanc invented.
   In addition to working in animation, he was a regular on radio's
``The Jack Benny Show,'' playing Professor LeBlanc, Benny's violin
teacher, and the train dispatcher who announced the stops of
``Ana-heim, A-zusa and KOOK-amunga!''
   Blanc also made the wheezing sounds of the timeworn 1924 Maxwell
automobile owned by Benny's skinflint comedy character.
   He reprised many of the roles when Benny moved to television.
   While recuperating in 1961 from a near-fatal car accident, Blanc
once recalled, he tried to count all his cartoon voices. He said he
fell asleep shortly after 400.
   He said when he came to, his first words to a physician were
``What's up, Doc?''
   In an interview last year, Blanc said Bugs _ originally called
Happy Rabbit _ was his favorite. ``Everybody knows who I am, Doc,''
he said in the character's voice. ``I don't cayuh where dey are or
who dey are. Even in Mars dey know about me.''
   Blanc made his last recording, a car commercial on May 19, the
day he entered Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   ``The only thing he said _ was `That's all folks,' and that's the
last thing that was recorded on tape,'' said Blanc's son, who
according to the elder Blanc is the only person who can imitate his
myriad voices.
   But Mel Blanc always will be remembered.
   ``As long as these cartoons are seen and enjoyed, Mel Blanc's
genius will be there for everyone,'' said Robert A. Daly, Warner
Bros.' chairman and chief executive officer.
   In addition to Blanc's son, survivors include his wife, the
former Estelle Rosenbaum. Funeral services were pending.
