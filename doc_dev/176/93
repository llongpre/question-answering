  [Excerpt] A cessation of activities is imminent at Radio 
Lumiere. The very high cost of oil products has prompted the 
officials of Radio Lumiere to consider ceasing all activities 
within two weeks. On 22 February, officials of the Protestant 
radio station commemorated its 35th anniversary by calling on 
evangelical Christians to make financial contributions so the 
radio station can continue its broadcasts. Raymond Exume, 
general manager of the satellite stations of Radio Lumiere, says 
he considers a shutdown of Radio Lumiere a failure that will 
have consequences for the entire Haitian evangelical community.
