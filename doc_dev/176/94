<HEAD>Iran Rips Middle East Trip By Charles And Diana</HEAD>

   Iran says the current
Middle East tour of Prince Charles and Princess Diana is a hostile
affront to Moslems who want Britain to ban Salman Rushdie's novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Tehran Radio on Wednesday accused the British government of
trying to exploit the trip and ``give a cold shoulder'' to the
world's Moslems. But it warned that Britain could not avoid facing
``their wrath.''
   On the second day of their official visit to the United Arab
Emirates Wednesday, the heir to the British throne and his wife were
steeped in Arab traditions. There was camel racing, sword dancing
and open-air lamb roasting.
   The couple is on an official one-week tour of Kuwait, Bahrain and
the Emirates that was announced last June. Charles will then fly
alone to Saudi Arabia for a private visit.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in London, noted that the visit was
taking place while the 45-nation Organization of Islamic Conference
was meeting in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with ``The Satanic
Verses'' at the top of the agenda.
   Iran on Wednesday told conference delegates it was honored to
have broken relations with Britain over the Rushdie affair. It
reiterated its call for the execution of Indian-born British author
first issued Feb. 14 by fundamentalist patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   ``Now under such circumstances when the British government has
applied all its resources for inflicting a blow upon Islam and
insulting our prophet, how can the presence of the British crown
prince in Islamic states be justified?'' said a commentary by Tehran
Radio.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
suggesting the Koran, Islam's holy book, was invented by the prophet
Mohammed rather than received directly from God, and for giving
prostitutes the names of Mohammed's wives.
