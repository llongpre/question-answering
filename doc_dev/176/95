<F P=106> [Interview with unidentified member of Moscow Radio </F>
International delegation to PRC by unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] A delegation from Moscow Radio International 
visited China from 5 to 12 April. A protocol on cooperation 
between Moscow Radio International and China Radio International 
was signed in Beijing on 11 April. The document includes 10 
articles, one of which provides that each side is to fund the 
broadcasting of its programs via satellite communications to 
ground receiver stations in the capital of its partner. Our 
guests also traveled to Shanghai. During its stay in Beijing, 
the delegation was interviewed by a correspondent from the 
Russian section of China Radio International. Listen to this 
interview. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] We know 
that during your visit, our radio stations signed documents of 
cooperation. How do you assess the prospects of our future 
cooperation? 
  [Delegation member] We have been cooperating for four years 
now, and we mutually extend the use of our transmitters. We 
have signed an agreement on extended mutual cooperation. We 
have also discussed still broader cooperation as well as 
exchanges of specialists, programs, and groups of journalists of 
various television and radio programs. The things outlined in 
the protocol signed today are the next step, but we have not 
stopped here. We have discussed meeting in Moscow this October 
or November to sign an even broader protocol. We have already 
determined the direction of our activity, and will sign [word 
indistinct] in Moscow this year. We are very satisfied with the 
rate in which our cooperation is growing from year to year. 
This helps both Chinese and Russian journalists and engineers, 
and constitutes mutual fertilization out of which new ideas and 
advances emerge. 
  The cooperation between Moscow Radio International and China 
Radio International in the technical field, and especially the 
allowing of mutual use of both countries' transmitters for 
broadcasting, is an important aspect of our work and [words 
indistinct] cooperation. But I believe a different side of the 
cooperation is no less important, and maybe even the most 
substantial. I am referring to the exchange of specialists, of 
groups of journalists, and of radio programs--in other words, 
fields in which cooperation is obvious. Cooperation in the 
technical field is important and essential; we simply could not 
conduct radio programs without it. However, this cooperation is 
invisible to many, and a limited number of Chinese and Russian 
experts know about it. 
  [Correspondent] One does not hear about it. 
  [Delegation member] Yes, that is correct. But when people 
visit a country themselves, Chinese journalists coming to Russia 
or Russian journalists going to China, when they see these 
changes with their own eyes and the way people relate to them, 
the upshot is that the most interesting radio programs are then 
broadcast. These programs introduce the life of a different 
country and different people, which is precisely what 
constitutes a bridge of mutual understanding between people who 
begin to understand each other deeper and better. I would like 
to focus your attention on this. Unfortunately, certain areas 
and points of cooperation in the sphere of exchange of 
specialists have not yet been included in the protocol signed 
today. But we hope, and maybe are even certain--and this 
certainty comes from both Russia and China being interested-- 
that we will certainly broaden and renew our connections as 
regards the exchange of journalists. [end recording]
