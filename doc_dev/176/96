  [Text] A delegation of Moscow Radio International is 
visiting China from 5 to 12 April. A protocol on cooperation 
between Moscow Radio International and China Radio International 
was signed in Beijing on 11 April. The document consists of 10 
articles. One of them envisages that each of the two sides will 
ensure, at its own expense, the transmission of its programs via 
a satellite channel to an earth receiving station in the capital 
city of the other country. 
  The signing ceremony was attended by Wang Feng, Chinese 
deputy minister of Radio, Film, and Television; (Chiang Renhua), 
director of China Radio International; (Xin Yimin), deputy 
director, and other responsible officials. 
  Our guests also visited China's largest city of Shanghai 
where the potential for multifaceted cooperation between 
Shanghai People's Radio and Moscow Radio International were 
discussed. The Russian delegation visited the construction site 
of the Pearl of the East television tower, the highest in Asia. 
The delegation will leave Beijing for Moscow on 12 April.
