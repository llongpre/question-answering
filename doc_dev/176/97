<F P=106> [Report by Scepan Aleksic from Cajnice] </F>
  [Text] At about 1820 this evening, NATO forces bombed the 
forces of the Herzegovina Corps in the region of Preljuc and 
Goli Vrh, some 13 kilometers southwest of Gorazde. NATO air 
forces carried out one attack. 
  The Command of the Herzegovina Corps is still not presenting 
details as to whether the Serbian forces have suffered any 
losses in the bombing. There is no confirmation of reports 
carried in foreign media that two Serbian tanks have been 
destroyed. 
  With this act, as most responsible people in the Command of 
the Herzegovina Corps claim, NATO forces fell for Muslims lies, 
and without any warning carried out open aggression on the army 
and people of the Serbian Republic [of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. The 
Command of the Herzegovina Corps this evening stated that the 
units of the Herzegovina Corps did not enter Gorazde, thus 
denying reports by the Muslim radio that they had already taken 
half of the town. 
  Without checking the facts, this report was carried by many 
western agencies this afternoon. That these claims are 
groundless can be concluded by the statements of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] representatives. It is incorrect that 
artillery is shelling the city center of Gorazde, which is also 
an invention by the Muslim propaganda machinery. Chemical 
agents have not been used, as claimed by foreign agencies. The 
truth is that chemical agents were used by the Muslims yesterday 
and this morning, but without any major consequences for the 
Serbian fighters.
