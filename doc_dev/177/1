   A striped shellfish now clogging water system
pipelines and threatening the ecological balance of the Great Lakes
could make its way to rivers around the country in as little as
five years, scientists say.
   The rapidly producing zebra mussels could pose a significant
problem for manufacturing plants, many of which have miles of pipes
that draw cooling water, the experts warn.
   The mussels eventually will attach themselves to the insides of
pipes supplying factories and municipal water plants, in some cases
restricting flow, in the Allegheny, Ohio and Monongahela rivers,
said Thomas Nalepa, a biologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   The Mississippi River basin also is vulnerable because Lake
Michigan, where the mussels are expected to arrive soon, is
connected to the Mississippi by the Chicago Canal.
   However, there is no reliable way to determine exactly when the
1{-inch mollusk will arrive in these or other rivers around the
country, scientists said.
   Zebra mussels, so named because of their brown and white zigzag
stripes, have been found in Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and Lake St.
Clair, near Detroit.
   They are growing on spawning reefs favored by walleye,
smallmouth bass and other fish in western Lake Erie, raising
concern about the future of a valuable fishery.
   Like barnacles, zebra mussels can travel by clinging to boat
hulls. They can survive out of water for perhaps up to 14 days by
living on internal moisture.
   ``Let's say someone from Pittsburgh were to trailer their boat
up to fish on Lake Erie and ended up with zebra mussels that
attached to their hull,'' said David Kelch, a specialist with Ohio
State University's sea grant program.
   ``They take their boat back to Pittsburgh and in a day or two
put the boat into a river or lake in that area. You've got them.''
   What's more, the larvae, or young, which are microscopic in
size, easily can attach themselves to an angler's minnow bucket, a
water nook in a boat trailer or the feathers of a duck.
   The zebra mussel originated in the Black and Caspian seas
between Europe and Asia. In 200 years, it has spread through much
of Europe. Two years ago, it was discovered in Lake St. Clair and
has infested water intakes for Erie, Toledo, Cleveland and Monroe,
Mich.
   The mussel reproduces at an astonishing rate. A single female
produces as many as 40,000 eggs each breeding season.
   The mollusk also has a voracious appetite for phytoplankton,
which are microscopic floating plants that form the bottom of the
food chain. Mussels could reduce the supply of phytoplankton for
microscopic animals called zooplankton. The zooplankton, in turn,
are eaten by smaller fish, which are eaten for food by larger fish.
   ``Anytime you impact the basic bottom building block of the food
chain, you're going to see an impact on the top predators _
walleye, smallmouth bass, yellow perch,'' Kelch said.
