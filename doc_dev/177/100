   Toxic chemicals blown from distant sites are
disrupting the life cycle of birds on the Great Lakes, and the
plight of the water fowl has worsened dramatically in recent years,
according to research released by environmentalists.
   ``In a broad sense, these chemicals are eliminating the diversity
in the Great Lakes,'' said James P. Ludwig, a consulting ecologist
from Bay City, Mich., at a news conference Tuesday. ``We have a few
species, but the elegance is gone.''
   Ludwig surveyed thousands of bird eggs and hatchlings in the
northern lakes and found sharp increases in deformities such as
malformed hips, club feet, eye abnormalities and body organs
attached outside the birds at birth.
   To demonstrate the effects of pollution, the researchers
displayed at the news conference a live cormorant with a twisted
beak. The bird, which was found on Naubinway Island, Mich., in
northern Lake Michigan, may eventually be placed in a petting zoo.
   A 1986-88 survey of water bird eggs in the upper Great Lakes
region found deformities in Caspian terns occurring 31 times more
frequently than in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ludwig said.
   Even low levels of contamination produced effects in the Great
Lakes food chain, Ludwig said.
   His research included birds nesting in highly contaminated areas,
such as Saginaw Bay in eastern Michigan.
   Many contaminants are blown into the lakes from many hundreds of
miles away, an ecologist said in describing research last year on
Isle Royal, Mich., an island in Lake Superior.
   Deborah Swackhammer, an ecologist with the University of
Minnesota, studied fish in Siskiwit Lake on the island and found
concentrations of the toxic chemical polychlorinated biphenyl.
   The PCB could only have reached the lake from the air, since the
lake's level is above that of surrounding Lake Superior, she said.
   ``Not only is every fish in the Great Lakes contaminated by
chemicals to some extent, but anything that consumes those fish is
also contaminated to some extent,'' including people, she said.
   The research was released as part of a lobbying effort by the
Sierra Club.
