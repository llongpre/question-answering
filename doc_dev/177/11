<HEAD>Zebra Mussel Infestation of Great Lakes Could Be Costly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zebra mussels accidentally imported to
the Great Lakes in the last four years are threatening commercial
and sport fishing and forcing cities and industries into costly
measures to protect water supplies.
   The 2-inch-long mollusk, first dropped off an ocean-going
freighter in Lake St. Clair outside Detroit, has spread through
Lake Erie and a colony was found in Lake Michigan near Green Bay,
Wis., said Michael Donahue, executive director of the Great Lakes
Commission, headquartered in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Intake pipes for industrial plants and municipal water systems
are among favorite breeding grounds for the greenish-striped
mussel. Monroe, Mich., just south of Detroit, is designing a system
to bathe the mouth of its intake system with ozone-infused water in
hopes of killing the mussels' larvae, but there is very little that
apparently can be done to stem the surge of the mussels.
   Cleveland is also facing heavy bills to rid itself of an
infestation, and Detroit has been forced to partially close its
water plant.
   ``I will guarantee you that it may be Detroit and Cleveland's
problem today, but it is going to be Gary's and Michigan City's
problem in the near future,'' Donahue said. ``There's just no way
to stop it.''
   In addition, the mussels feed voraciously on algae that other
fish and mollusks need, and could devastate Lake Erie's walleye
pike _ one of the lake's most important commercial fish, by
covering spawning grounds, said Jon Stanley, of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Ann Arbor.
   ``Those actions in Lake Erie, we expect, will reduce the walleye
population by about half,'' Stanley said. A ``good portion'' of the
estimated $600 million a year in Lake Erie fisheries comes from
walleye.
   Beaches also could become fouled by the sharp-edged mussel
shells, Stanley said. ``You can notice the difference on some
beaches already. They used to be nice soft sand, but now they
crunch underfoot as you walk.''

<HEAD>Researchers Use Dogs to Test Radon Exposure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty dogs will have radon
detectors attached to their collars as part of a study into the
effects of the odorless gas.
   ``We hope to find an association between radon exposure and lung
cancer in dogs and, therefore, in humans,'' said Purdue University
veterinarian Robert Teclaw. ``The long-term goal is to find out if
dogs can serve as warning signals on environmental hazards to
humans.''
   Dogs were chosen because they are in the house as much or more
than people, who work outside the home, and because they have a
shorter lifespan. Any health hazards from radon will show up
earlier in the animals than in humans.
   Dog owners in Tippecanoe County, where Purdue is located, this
month began fitting their pets with the collars, which will be worn
for three months. The detectors weigh less than an ounce and are
the size of a silver dollar. Film inside the detector is sensitive
to ions emitted by radon. Radon coming in contact with the film
will leave tell-tale tracks.
   Radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas that comes
predominantly from the decay of radium, which occurs naturally in
the soil and can accumulate in a house. Exposure over a long period
of time has been associated with lung cancer and other health risks.
   The owners also will be asked to keep diaries of where the dogs
spent their time and how long they were in each area of the house.
The radon level in the house will be measured separately.
