<HEAD>Spread of Zebra Mussels Inland Feared After Lake Superior
Discovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Scientists say the zebra mussel will spread
to inland waters following the first confirmed sightings in Lake
Superior.
   ``This isn't going to just affect anglers,'' said Dennis Pratt,
western Lake Superior fisheries manager for the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources. ``This one's going to affect
industry, boaters ... and the ecosystem is going to take it on the
chin.''
   Discovery in March of the mussel in the Twin Ports of Duluth and
Superior, Wis., proves the pest is established in all the Great
Lakes, scientists say.
   The invader brought via the St. Lawrence Seaway in the ballast
of European freighters was found last month on eight of 26 St.
Louis River buoys inspected.
   Experts say the half-inch, barnacle-like shellfish multiply so
fast that colonies of millions may turn up soon. They can clog
water valves, foul city water systems and pollute beaches.
   ``They have a two-year reproductive cycle. I think you'll start
seeing them next year in big numbers,'' Pratt said. And once
they're here, there's almost nothing that can be done to stop them,
Pratt said.
   Zebra mussels have caused millions of dollars in damage in Lake
Erie and Lake St. Clair. Great Lakes environmental officials say
virtually all the hard surfaces in the two lakes are covered with
zebra mussel beds at least an inch thick.
   The creatures also have accumulated two inches thick and clogged
water intakes at five Cleveland Electric Illumination Co. power
plants. Monroe, Mich., was forced to close its water plant for
three days when zebra mussels were so thick on intake pipes they
slowed water flow.
   Dead zebra mussels can give off offensive quantities of methane
gas and foul city water supplies.
   Environmentally, it's feared huge colonies of zebra mussels on
rocks and shoals will disrupt fish spawning, especially walleye and
lake trout. They also are believed to increase the spread of
parasites damaging to fish and waterfowl.
   A bill moving through Congress asks for $40 million to help
combat the mussels. The mussels' total economic damage in the Great
Lakes could hit $5 billion by the turn of the century, a
congressional study said.
   The mussels apparently have few natural enemies, and it is
unlikely they'll be food for humans because they're so small and
carry parasites.
   Scientists on the lower Great Lakes are experimenting with
ultrasound vibrations to keep the mussels away. Chlorination also
seems to help, as does electric shock and speeding the water flow.

<HEAD>Chemists' Laboratory-Created Molecule Makes, Stores Energy</HEAD>

   Arizona State University scientists said
they have have created a molecule which converts light into energy
almost as efficiently as the natural process of photosynthesis and
stores it the way a battery would.
   The development one day could lead to new methods of harvesting
solar energy, the chemists said.
   ``Nobody's going to put the kind of devices we're making now on
their roof and start harvesting energy,'' said Devens Gust, a
leader of the team from the university's Photosynthesis Research
Center.
   He said silicon solar cells already in use were much more
practical for such purposes, but the microscopic ASU device may be
suited to drive chemical reactions.
   The researchers published the details of their work in the April
13 issue of the journal Science.
   Gust said the researchers call the device a ``pentad molecule''
because of its five active parts. A critical factor in its success
is its ability to change light into electrically charged chemicals
and store the energy, he said.
   He said the molecule does that by separating the positively and
negatively charged parts of atoms and holding them about
one-billionth of a centimeter apart at opposite ends of the
ladder-like molecule.
   The synthetic molecule can capture and store 83 percent as much
energy as its natural counterparts, Gust said.
   Mark Wrighton, chairman of the chemistry department at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said efficient molecular
electronic components could radically increase the speed and
capability of computers.
   Gust said one problem with using the molecule in consumer
electronics is its size.
   ``The traditional approach to electronics really has been a
materials approach,'' Gust said. ``You start out with something
such as bulk silicon. Then you devise ways to make devices from
that bulk silicon that are smaller and smaller.''
   Using the molecular-electronics approach, he said, ``You design
the device at the molecular level. Then you try to figure out ways
to incorporate these molecular-sized devices into large,
macroscopic electronic circuits.''
   Such applications may be years away, Gust said.
