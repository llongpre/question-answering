<HEAD>Discovery Of Zebra Mussels In Hudson River Startles Scientists</HEAD>

   CROTON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) - The discovery of zebra mussels in
the brackish waters of the Hudson River startled scientists, who
said Thursday the pests weren't supposed to get this far south this
soon.
   ``We've just thrown the book out now,'' Avery Klauber, a
spokesman for New York Sea Grant at the State University of New
York in Stony Brook. ``There's no way of knowing how far and how
fast they're going to travel.''
   Experts didn't expect the tiny mussel, named for its striped
shell, to appear in the Hudson until next year or the year after.
Scientists also had hoped the waters of the lower Hudson, with a
salinity of eight parts per thousand, would be too salty for the
mussels.
   They have been spreading through the Great Lakes since 1988,
when scientists think European ships released them with ballast
water.
   The mussels have few natural predators and breed rapidly,
causing problems for industries, power plants, public water systems
and boaters by clogging water intakes. They can also wreak havoc on
aquatic food chains.
   Federal officials have estimated that control of the mussels
could cost as much as $5 billion over the next decade in the Great
Lakes region.
   The Hudson River discovery is the first North American sighting
of the pest outside the Great Lakes drainage basin, said Charles
O'Neill, supervisor of the New York Zebra Mussel Information
Clearinghouse at the State University of New York at Brockport.
   ``Everybody was watching to see where they'd turn up out of the
Great Lakes,'' O'Neill said. ``This one being such a jump opens up
the possibility that the mussels can be really widely scattered.''
   The animals were discovered by accident on a piece of wood
collected for an museum exhibit from Haverstraw Bay, about 25 miles
north of New York City, O'Neill said, adding it was too early to
tell the extent of the infestation.
   He said the mussels may have been brought to the river by a
Great Lakes pleasure boat or a European ship, or even by a piece of
wood floating from the Erie Canal to the Mohawk River and on into
the Hudson.
   The discovery of the mussels is particularly worrisome to
officials of four major power plants near the discovery site,
O'Neill said.
   Experts expect zebra mussels eventually to find their way into
the Mississippi River through canals connecting it to the Great
Lakes. From there, they could spread across the United States.
   ``We're looking at a critter that within the next couple
generations could very possibly be found throughout North
America,'' O'Neill said.
   In Washington, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., issued a plea to
President Bush Thursday to sign legislation authorizing $60 million
for project grants and research funding to control the mussels.
