   The zebra mussel is one of many exotic species
invading U.S. waters, and a broad strategy is needed to keep them
from wreaking economic and environmental havoc, experts said
Tuesday.
   The river ruffe, spiny water flea and tube-nosed goby soon may
become as familiar to the Great Lakes as the zebra mussel,
witnesses said at a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on
Environmental Protection.
   Meanwhile, the asiatic clam, Japanese seaweed and the red tide
are damaging shellfish and marine industries along the ocean coasts.
   The newcomers threaten many native species, interrupt the food
chain and pose a danger to the U.S. fishing industry and other
segments of the economy, said Gillman D. Veith, director of the
Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and
Development.
   ``Given the rate of technological change and movement of people,
it is likely that the problems resulting from invasions of
non-native species will increase,'' said Veith.
   The city of Monroe, Mich., was forced to ration water for
several days and spend $500,000 removing zebra mussels from its
water intake pipe last year, said Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis. Shipping,
tourism, paper production and other industries could be affected if
such problems become widespread, he said.
   ``There is growing concern that the introduction of
non-indigenous species by ships, particularly through their ballast
water, has affected the ecosystems and economies of countries
around the world,'' said Capt. Thomas E. Thompson of the U.S. Coast
Guard.
   Bills pending in the House and Senate would order the Coast
Guard to develop and enforce regulations on dumping of ships'
ballast water _ the suspected source of zebra mussels, which are
native to fresh-water bodies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The tiny bivalves with zebra-like stripes have spread with
lightning speed through the Great Lakes since their arrival in
1986. They fasten themselves to hard surfaces, such as pipes and
boat hulls, and ingest plankton essential to the aquatic food chain.
   Senators from the region urged quick action and braodening the
scopes of the bills to deal with other natural invaders.
