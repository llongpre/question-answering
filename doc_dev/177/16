   The Senate has approved a $20 million research
and prevention program to keep zebra mussels from invading farm
irrigation systems.
   The striped mollusk, which is not native to North America, has
caused problems at water and power plants throughout the Great
Lakes. They attach to water intake pipes and clog them.
   An amendment authorizing the $20 million over five years was
added to the 1990 farm bill by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   ``Unlike other infestations, this one is irreversible,''
Moynihan said in a statement Thursday. ``The zebra mussel is here
to stay ... Within 20 years' time it will have spread through the
entire surface water system of North America.''
   The amendment, which the Senate passed late Wednesday, directs
the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
to develop a program of research, prevention and design criteria
for irrigation systems with an emphasis on keeping the mussels out.
   On Wednesday, scientists expressed surprise that the tiny
mollusks are spreading through the Erie Canal system from Buffalo,
N.Y., and now threaten Rochester, N.Y. and the Finger Lakes region.
   ``Frankly, I did not think their advance would be this fast,''
said Cameron Lange, a biologist studying the mussels' movement for
a consortium of power companies.
   ``I thought we might find a few at Lockport during our late July
sample but I did not think they'd reach Rochester by now.''
   Rochester is about 60 miles east of Lockport, N.Y.
   In May, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works
authorized $37.5 million in grants and research funding for control
of the mussel. The provision is part of the pending Water Resources
Development Act of 1990.
