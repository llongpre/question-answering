<LEADPARA>  Fast-breeding zebra mussels are spreading quicker and causing more damage to
Lake Michigan factories, utilities and boats far sooner than had been
predicted, according to Chicago-area experts. Massive infestations of the
gray- and white-striped, fingernail-size mollusks along Lake Michigan caused a
steel mill to reduce operations by more than half when they clogged a key
water intake, and some boaters are reporting mussels crippling their engines.;
  In the year since the European species was found near Chicago, it has spread
along the Illinois and Indiana lake shore and north into Wisconsin and
traveled 300 miles by water to the Mississippi River.  </LEADPARA>
