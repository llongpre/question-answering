<LEADPARA>  Engineers and biologists say the zebra mussel -- a sticky, prolific little
troublemaker -- will soon invade the Ohio River and its tributaries.
Discovered in U.S. waters only five years ago, the tiny shelled animal
attaches itself to boat hulls, docks and water intakes and outlets and is "a
difficult creature for water utilities to handle," said Dennis Willaman,
general manager of the Kenton County Water District in Covington, Ky. In the
past, the mussels have clogged pipes in various municipal water systems.
Scientists think the mussel, once found only in Europe, hitched a ride in the
ballast water of a U.S.-bound vessel. The ship discharged its water into the
Great Lakes, where the transplanted mollusks flourished. Experts say the
mussel has no known predators other than a few species of ducks.  </LEADPARA>
