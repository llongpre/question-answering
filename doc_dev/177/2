   EDITOR'S NOTE - They are alien creatures of the deep, unknown in
the waters of the United States until a few years ago. They can cut
off the water supply of cities, ruin boat engines, and scientists
worry that they will upset the aquatic food chain. The invasion of
the zebra mussels, which began in the Great Lakes, is expected to
spread to waterways across the land.

   Microscopic at birth, the tiny invaders
ride the currents of the Great Lakes searching for a home along the
rocky lake bottom, or better yet, on a man-made structure.
   Life is easy with few natural predators and plenty of solid
structures to attach their hairlike tentacles. And laying 30,000
eggs a year does more than just keep the family heritage going.
   They grow to the size of a pistachio nut within two years as the
zigzagged stripes begin appearing on their army-green shells. Man
is little deterrent to their population explosion because he's
still trying to understand them.
   ``At first we couldn't identify it,'' says Monroe water plant
superintendent Wilfred LePage. ``A couple months later, biologists
told us, `You have zebra mussels and you may never be rid of them
again.'''
   That was in January 1989. Last December, a colony of zebra
mussels and ice clogged Monroe's only water intake from Lake Erie,
cutting the flow to a trickle. Businesses and schools were closed,
hospital surgeries were postponed and the city went to a local
river and nearby Toledo for water during the two-day emergency.
   ``We went through hell,'' LePage says.
   The event earned Monroe a reputation as the Pearl Harbor of the
zebra mussel invasion. Eventually, the fingernail-sized, inedible
mollusk is expected to spread beyond the Great Lakes to lakes and
rivers in 60 percent of the country.
   ``The lesson I'm trying to get out to water plants is, `Get
ready, because they're gonna come.''' LePage says. ``And when they
do, things happen so fast. Then you'll have to pull out all the
stops just to keep your plant running.''
   Some already know.
   -The city of Detroit water department, which provides drinking
water for 42 percent of Michigan's 9 million residents, this year
built a chlorination plant to control zebra mussels at one of its
three water intakes.
   -The U.S. Coast Guard is finding zebra mussels on the bottoms of
some of its navigational buoys and vessels in the Great Lakes.
Marinas in Lake Erie report the zebra mussels have been found
blocking water intakes for engine cooling systems.
   -The four major steel companies in northwest Indiana have
received variances from their pollution discharge permits allowing
them to use molluscicides to kill zebra mussels at their water
intakes in Lake Michigan.
   -Electric utilities along Lake Erie are stepping up their
inspections of water intakes for coal-burning and nuclear power
plants. Detroit Edison estimates it will spend $500,000 next year
for a zebra mussel control program at its Monroe coal-burning
plant.
   The coming of the zebra mussel has ramifications beyond just
water plants. Scientists worry that they will alter the aquatic
food chain, that mollusk-borne toxins will end up in sport fish and
waterfowl, and that zebra mussels will disturb fish-spawning
grounds and clog water intakes critical for farm irrigation.
   The mussels also cling to boat hulls and boat engines, and their
shells can slice the feet of beachgoers. They are the Great Lakes'
version of the leaf-eating gypsy moth caterpillar or the
Africanized ``killer'' bee.
   ``The zebra mussel is likely to spread much more quickly than
the gypsy moth,'' says Richard Moll, assistant director of the
Michigan Sea Grant program. ``I would imagine in a couple decades
they'll be found throughout the U.S.''
   Like the gypsy moth, the zebra mussel was inadvertently imported
into the United States from Europe, probably aboard a freighter. It
is one of about 115 foreign species that have been introduced into
the Great Lakes by man, intentionally and unintentionally,
according to Ed Mills, a senior research scientist with Cornell
University in Ithaca, New York.
   The zebra mussel is believed to have entered the Great Lakes
area when the freighter of uncertain flag emptied its ballast water
into Lake St. Clair in 1985 or 1986. It has been sighted in each of
the Great Lakes and is moving to inland waterways by hitchhiking on
boats, boat trailers, bait pails and even waterfowl.
   It conceivably can live in waters throughout the temperate
region of the United States, which includes about 60 percent of the
country, and southern Canada. In New York state, the zebra mussel
is moving eastward from Buffalo along the Erie Canal. The Finger
Lakes aren't far behind.
   ``They'll be colonized fairly soon,'' says Robert Lange, a
biologist with the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation. ``They are working through the Erie Canal east. So
far they've reached Rochester and eventually they'll reach the
Hudson.''
   The Mississippi River is expected to be colonized by Great Lakes
mussels entering either in Minnesota or through the Illinois River
near St. Louis.
