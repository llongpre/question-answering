<HEAD>Tiny Foreigner Invades Great Lakes</HEAD>

   Yet another foreign invader has ignored the
border and taken up residence in the Great Lakes.
   A tube-nosed goby, a 3-inch-long fish from the Black Sea region
of the Soviet Union, was recently found on an intake screen at the
Detroit Edison Co.'s Belle River plant on the St. Clair River.
   But the goby doesn't appear threatening, unlike a host of other
invaders, including the water pipe-clogging zebra mussel, the
trout-killing sea lamprey, and the beach-befouling alewife.
   Like other non-native critters, the goby probably got to the
Great Lakes by hitching a ride on ocean freighters which take on
water _ and any small free-swimming animals that happen to be in
the way _ for ballast. When the ship reaches port on the Great
Lakes to take on cargo, the ballast gets dumped.
   Threatening or no, the goby isn't welcome.
   Biologists ``don't like to see foreign species end up in our
bodies of water,'' said Dave Jude, the University of Michigan
scientist who found the fish.
