<LEADPARA>  MOST everybody must know that Lake Superior is the largest body of fresh water
in the world and that Lake Erie was so polluted that it once caught on fire.; 
  But, unless we've lived on or near the Great Lakes, that may be the extent
of what most of us know about that enormous system of lakes and waterways
along the U.S.-Canadian border.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now, thanks to the latest National Geographic TV special, "Great Lakes,
Fragile Seas" (Wednesday, 8 p.m., Ch. 9), we can learn a lot more about the
lakes and the imposing challenges that threaten their long-term survival.;   
This excellent hour documentary, written, produced and photographed by Joe
Seamans, contains some facts that may amaze most of us, including:;    (box) 
The five lakes -- Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Superior -- hold at least
six quadrillion gallons of water, enough to flood all 48 contiguous states to
a depth of 10 feet.;    (box)  The largest lakes are so huge that they
frequently have stormy "seas" that rival those found in the world's oceans.;  
 (box)  More than 10,000 vessels have sunk while crossing the Great Lakes.;   
(box)  The flow in the lakes is so complex that it may take nearly 100 years
for toxic chemicals to completely wash out of their waters.;    (box)  The
lakes contain about 20 percent of all the fresh water on the planet.;   
Scooped out by glacial action about 20,000 years ago, the Great Lakes face
several simultaneous ecological crises brought about by humans' intense use of
their waters in just the past 200 years.;    Seamans' camera shows us deformed
fish and birds, genetically damaged by toxic chemicals still present in the
waters despite heroic efforts to clean them up after a 1972 pact between the
U.S. and Canadian governments.;    We also see what amounts to "biological
pollution" from the destructive Zebra mussels, now multiplying rapidly in the
lakes and destroying the natural food chain by siphoning off up to 50 percent
of all nutrients needed by native lake species.;    Experts studying the
problem believe that the mussels, native to the Caspian and Black seas, were
carried into the lakes by seagoing foreign vessels. If Americans and Canadians
hadn't built a complex system of locks and waterways, linking the lakes to the
Atlantic, these marauders never would have turned up.;     Diversity of life; 
Originally, lakes Ontario and Erie were linked only by the Niagara River. The
spectacular Niagara Falls served as a natural barrier to invasion of outside
species. But the human-made bypass of the falls opened the doorway to what may
be ecological disaster.;    Seamans' far-ranging film aptly demonstrates the
diversity of life on the lakes, beyond the skyscraper-lined cities along their
shores. For example, we visit remote Madeline Island on Lake Superior, which
is reached only by "wind sleds" during the icy winters, and a Chippewa Indian
community, where wild rice is harvested in preserved wetlands the same way it
was 200 years ago.;    Wreckage explored; In what may be the film's most
bizarre excursion, we probe the depths of Lake Superior by robot mini-sub to
explore the wreckage of the 729-foot steel freighter Edmund Fitzgerald, which
split in half and sank during a tremendous storm in 1975.;    Though "Great
Lakes, Fragile Seas" does include some sobering information, it's not a
downer. Progress is being made in halting the environmental threats to the
lakes. They're even pulling big, beautiful, edible fish from the same waters
that once caught fire; so it seems there is cause for cautious optimism after
all. (box)  </TEXT>
