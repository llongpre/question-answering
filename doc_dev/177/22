   Some people never throw anything
away, according to Scott Bruce, who came to this breakfast food
mecca looking for old cereal boxes to add to his collection.
   Sound flaky?
   ``Cereal boxes represent heroes of popular culture _ the grain
gods, I call them,'' said Bruce, a Cambridge, Mass., collector who
once started a lunch-box collecting craze.
   ``When a kid sits down with a bowl of his favorite cereal, he
becomes one with his hero. It's like a secular communion rite.''
   Bruce, 34, is talking this week with cereal company executives
as well as ordinary people who hoard cereal boxes, if there is such
a thing.
   Rare boxes can fetch up to $1,000, said Bruce, who began his
collection in 1988 and recently published a collector's magazine
called Flake.
   Battle Creek is the home of Kellogg Co., the world's largest
cereal maker, as well as Post and Ralston-Purina plants.
   ``The people here have cereal in their bloodstream,'' said Bruce.
   Old cereal boxes are all the more valuable because of the
scarcity of people who allow them to hang around.
   ``The militant mom was the death to many collections,'' he said
mournfully. ``But maybe I'll find that that odd citizen who has a
Corn Flakes box with Vanessa Williams.'' Miss Williams, Miss
America 1984, lost the crown when it was disclosed she had posed
nude for Playboy.
   Bruce said he generally hunts for vintage boxes in good
condition from the 1930s through 1970s. But he's even squirreling
away some of today's boxes.
   ``The 1990 Batman cereal box from Ralston is an instant
classic,'' he said. ``Just you wait.''

   A marina owner has discovered a use for
the pesky zebra mussels clogging water intake lines along Lake Erie.
   Kent Floro makes the mussels into jewelry.
   ``Business has been going quite well,'' said Floro, owner of
Floro's Marina and a convenience store. ``It's kind of like your
pet rock from a few years ago. Everyone's got to have one.''
   Floro said he collects the basic raw material from the shore by
his marina. Completed mussel earrings, necklaces, tie clips and hat
pins cost between $3 and $4.
   ``We aren't going to run out of stock,'' Floro said, pointing
out that a mussel can produce 30,000 larvae a year.
   The tiny shellfish, less than an inch long, have been clogging
water intake lines from the lake since 1988.
