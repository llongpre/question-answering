   An international commission urged the United
States and Canada on Thursday to bar new species of animals from the
Great Lakes in an effort to prevent additional harm to the region's
delicate ecology.
   ``The integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem requires the
maintenance of a balanced yet dynamic natural system,'' the
International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canadian agency, said in a
report on the lakes' environment.
   ``Introduced species can seriously affect the balance and
distribution of native species by altering the structure and
developmental patterns of their biological communities,'' it added.
   The report by the commission noted that there have been
continuing concerns about outside species in the lakes, the sea
lamprey and smelt in particular.
   However, in recent years, the number of alien species introduced
into the lakes has shown a significant increase.
   Among the outside species that now threaten the lakes' native
life forms are the alewife, the coho salmon, the Asiatic clam, the
zebra mussel and the river ruffe.
   The commission encouraged involvement by the coast guards of the
United States and Canada in controlling the problem, and recommended
that the nations ``take steps to prevent the further introduction,
particularly the unplanned introduction, of exotic life forms into
the Great Lakes ecosystem.''
   It was the first time the commission had made such a
recommendation, said Frank Bevacqua of the commission's Washington
office.
   Some of the outside species were introduced for sport fishing.
Others made their way into the lakes as hitchhikers on ships or
through extending their range from bodies of water outside the lakes
region.
   Although the new species are controlled by predators in their
original homes, many lack predators in the lakes, ``and given an
adequate food supply and appropriate life-support systems, ... they
can become a serious threat if they outcompete or destroy valuable
native species,'' the commission said.
   The report also warned of increasing concentrations of toxic
substances in Great Lakes animals, a reversal of declines recorded
in the 1970s.
   Waterbirds on the lakes, however, were producing more offspring,
the commission said.
   ``Populations that were once declining have increased
substantially, and reproductive problems in fish-eating birds are
generally confined to specific sites,'' the report said.
``Similarly, increasing bald eagle nesting sites are being reported
in the basin.''
   The report gave no figures on increased toxic-substance
concentration or bird reproduction.
