   Liz Taylor, Roberto Duran and a pack of
marauding mussels all came to Congress this past week, in one form
or another.
   If you thought your representatives spent all week on such
weighty matters as aid for Eastern Europe and the Clean Air bill,
think again.
   Most members of Congress devote only a small portion of their
days to such pursuits. Just as many hours, and usually many more,
are spent on keeping constituents happy, getting one's picture or
name mentioned in the hometown or national press, attending
receptions, and lavishing praise on colleagues and witnesses.
   A typical two-hour congressional hearing, for example, will
devote 20 minutes or so to rituals of accolade. The Democratic
chairman of the committee praises a colleague for helping prepare
the session; the ranking Republican praises the chairman for
holding the hearing; the members praise the witness _ an
administration official or specialist of some sort _ for his or her
work on the subject, and so on.
   With some 250 committees and subcommittees in Congress, the 100
Senate members and their 435 colleagues in the House are busy
people. Most sit on three or four committees, which is where most
congressional action is taken.
   Except during floor votes, the main chambers of the House and
Senate are virtually empty, with only a speaker on the podium and a
stray clerk or usher in the aisles.
   More often than not, lawmakers will stay away from a plenary
session to make time for a meeting with constituents visiting
Washington. After all, these are the people who will get them
re-elected.
   On a recent day, Rep. Dave McCurdy's schedule had 15 constituent
visits. Aides to the Oklahoma Democrat say this is an unusally
heavy load, although not rare.
   McCurdy and his colleagues also have to travel to their home
districts periodically to meet with voters and tend to local
business. Last year, McCurdy flew home 11 times.
   No wonder, then, that much of the work on Capitol Hill gets
accomplished by staff members rather than by the lawmakers
themselves. Most members have a staff of about 20, although some _
especially if they chair influential committees _ have double that.
In all, Congress employs about 20,000 people _ including security
police, cleaners and clerks.
   While visits by foreign visitors _ presidents, prime ministers
and the like _ usually get bigger headlines, American celebrities
are often a much bigger draw at the Capitol itself.
   Elizabeth Taylor came to Capitol Hill to lobby for a bill that
would give $600 million to AIDS sufferers.
   Although Congress has been discussing the proposed bill for
weeks, Miss Taylor's appearance at a hearing and a news conference
drew dozens of lawmakers eager to shake her hand or stare into her
famous violet eyes.
   ``It took Elizabeth Taylor to get you to one of my hearings,''
the panel's chairman, California Rep. Barbara Boxer, admonished her
Democratic colleague from Illinois, Richard Durbin.
   Dante Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
made time last week for boxer Roberto Duran. The former
welterweight champion came to Congress to seek aid for his native
Panama, food for hungry children and housing for Panamanians left
homeless by the U.S. invasion last December.
   And then there were the marauding mollusks.
   Reporters on Capitol Hill, sifting through their mail boxes,
pulled out a plastic bag stuffed with mussel shells appended to a
press release.
   ``Sen. John Glenn and Rep. Henry Nowak today proposed a $40
million plan to control the zebra mussel, the small shellfish
attacking water intake pipes and creating environmental problems in
the Great Lakes,'' the release said.
   Glenn was joined at a news conference by seven lawmakers
battling the spread of the mollusks, which reached the Great Lakes
by stowing away on freighters from Europe.
   ``I can tell you it's no joke,'' Glenn said.
