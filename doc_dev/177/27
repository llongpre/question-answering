   A spiny-tailed little creature with a big
appetite, a water flea that may have hitched a ride from Europe
aboard Soviet freighters, is threatening to disrupt the food chain
in the Great Lakes, a federal scientist said Tuesday.
   Only a half-inch long, the predator called bythotrephes is a
variety of water flea with a long, spiny tail, said Henry A.
Vanderploeg, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   What bythotrephes lacks in size, it makes up for in appetite.
Vanderploeg said his research showed one of the little creatures in
a day can clear 1{ quarts of water of the native water fleas that
provide food for newborn fish.
   ``For an animal this small, it represents a high rate of
clearance,'' Vanderploeg said at NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental
Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   The water fleas native to the Great Lakes provide food for
juvenile alewives, bloaters and perch, which in turn are food for
salmon, trout and other large predatory fish.
   Because of bythotrephes, in future years ``it is possible that,
for example, alewives, certain forage fish, could be less abundant,
and since these forage fish would be less abundant, salmon and
trout could also become less abundant,'' Vanderploeg said.
   However, a more precise forecast of the effect of the European
predator must await a better understanding of the Great Lakes food
chain, he said.
   Bythotrephes were first found in Lake Huron in 1984 and by 1986
had spread to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. They are now found in all
the Great Lakes.
   The predators may have been brought from Europe in water ballast
aboard empty grain freighters from the Soviet Union and dumped into
the lakes, NOAA said.
   Bythotrephes are found in freshwater throughout northern Europe.
There, however, ``it is not disruptive to the food chain in the
sense that it has been there for a long time,'' Vanderploeg said.
``All the plankton and fish that have evolved there are used to
having it around.''
   Although the European predator can damage the Great Lakes food
supply for very young fish, ``at a certain stage in the life cycle
of a fish, bythotrephes would then become food for that fish,''
Vanderploeg said.
