<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday signed a $2.5
billion bill authorizing new water projects for flood control,
storm damage reduction, inland navigation and port development.
   ``In addition to authorizing worthwhile water resources
projects, the legislation includes a number of provisions that
protect and restore this nation's environment, which I
wholeheartedly support,'' Bush said in a statement.
   Even so, Bush said, the legislation ``contains a number of
special-interest provisions'' in some of the projects.
   He said these included developing recreation facilities, levee
beautification, agricultural land improvements and, in one
instance, replacing a bridge.
   ``Because I believe in a strong water resources program, and
despite my concerns about a number of inappropriate provisions, I
have approved this bill,'' Bush said.
   Bush also signed legislation designed to protect coastal inland
waters from the zebra mussel and other so-called ``nuisance
species''
   It contains provisions for wetlands restoration and protection,
especially in Louisiana, and fish and wildlife conservation in the
Great Lakes.
