   Lake Erie has the greatest infestation, but scientists hold out
hope that the other Great Lakes will experience only small
invasions because they don't have the rocky bottom structure Lake
Erie has.
   The zebra mussel is so dangerous because it can reproduce so
quickly. A fully mature female can produce more than 30,000 eggs
per season. The eggs are fertilized outside the shell and hatch
into free-swimming larvae called veligers.
   The veligers can remain suspended in the water for one to three
weeks, allowing currents to scatter them. If they don't settle on
firm objects in that time period, they die. Those that find a hard
surface attach to it with extremely strong tentacle-like threads.
The zebra mussel is mature at one year and can live to about 4
years old and grow to about 1{ inches long.
   ``The older they get, the tougher they are to remove,'' says
Gerry Mackie, a researcher at the University of Guelph in Ontario.
``Nothing or very few things can pry it off the rock. That makes it
tough for predators.''
   And the zebra mussel has few natural predators outside of the
diving duck and sheepshead fish.
   The zebra mussel has flourished in Lake Erie, where it filters
plankton from the water. An adult can filter about a quart of water
per day, and that's what concerns scientists about the impact on
the food chain.
   ``The current situation is the plankton is out in the open
water,'' Mills says. ``With the zebra mussel, which settles on the
bottom, they will be removing particles from the open water. More
of this food is going to be channeled to the bottom. Getting this
food to a salmon is going to be less efficient.''
   Researchers say it's too early to tell how the zeb mussel will
affect sport fishing. They say there could be an increase in mussel
predators such as the bottom-feeding sheepshead, but it's unknown
how they will affect more sought-after fish in the Great Lakes,
such as walleye and lake trout.
   Mackie says, however, there are some positive aspects to the
zebra mussel invasion. The zebra mussel's filtering ability is
making Lake Erie clearer.
   ``I've never seen Lake Erie look so nice as it has,'' LePage
says. ``I've seen the bottom of the lake in places that I've never
seen before.''
   In the Netherlands and Soviet Union, researchers put the zebra
mussel's filtering ability to use in clarifying lakes. They also
use it as a biological monitor to detect what chemicals are in the
water.
   In the United States and Canada, a new industry has sprouted
around the zebra mussel. Dow Chemical Company in Midland, Mich.,
and many others are developing anti-fouling boat coatings to keep
zebra mussels from attaching. The King Co. in Holland, Mich., has
developed a bullet-shaped squeegee to scrape and remove zebra
mussels from water intake pipes.
   Researchers from around the country are watching Congress to see
whether it appropriates $37.5 million for research and control of
the zebra mussel. Others are refining methods to control the pest.
Most of those solutions are based on chlorine, which is fatal to
the zebra mussel. It's been used for the past 200 years in the
mollusk's native Europe.
   In Monroe, a chlorine spray jet has been installed at the mouth
of the water intake to treat the water as it enters the pipe.
   ``So far we are keeping them down,'' LePage says. ``Our intake
is as clean as a whistle.''
   Monroe used the King Co.'s squeegee to clean its intake pipe
after last year's invasion. The high-tech RotoRooter removed enough
mussels to fill six dump trucks. It cost the city $250,000 to get
the system back to pre-mussel operating levels.
   The water plant sends divers down regularly to inspect the
intake for zebra mussel buildup. The city also is building a second
water intake designed to prevent another zebra mussel takeover. The
modifications will cost the city an extra $2 million, LePage says.
   To control the zebra mussel, Great Lakes researchers are trying
to learn all they can about the mussel's habits - its reproduction,
its predators and parasites, and its favorite nesting spots.
   At a recent meeting of zebra mussel experts from around the
world in Saginaw, Mich., some said the best approach may be to find
ways to control and even anticipate all introduced species, not
just the zebra mussel. Other species recently introduced in the
Great Lakes are upsetting the food chain. They include the spiny
water flea and the ruffe, a fish limited mainly to the Duluth,
Minn., area.
   The scientists proposed forming a center for the study of
introduced species, possibly to be established at a university in
the Great Lakes.
   ``It's going to take years of research before we get a
definitive answer,'' Mackie says.
