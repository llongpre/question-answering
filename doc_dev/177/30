<HEAD>Erie's Cleaner Now, No Fires in Almost 20 Years</HEAD>

   Nearly 20 years after the Cuyahoga River last
caught fire, officials say Lake Erie and its tributaries are
cleaner than they have been in decades.
   Scores of Lake Erie beaches will be open in Ohio this year, and
more than 25 million walleye thrive in Erie's waters. Boating has
become so popular that many marinas in the Toledo area are running
out of dock space.
   A few decades ago, Lake Erie had only three clean beaches, and
fish were dying at a rapid rate. An oil slick on the Cuyahoga
caught fire June 22, 1969.
   The dramatic improvement has been caused primarily by a decrease
in phosphates and other nutrients that caused algae to flourish in
Lake Erie, using up oxygen and killing fish, said Laura Fay, a
research associate for the Center for Lake Erie Area Research.
   Phosphate pollution levels were decreased largely through
improvement of sewage treatment plants, she said.
   Half the people living in the Great Lakes basin live near Lake
Erie, including residents of Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit and Erie,
Pa. Eleven million people use Lake Erie for their drinking water,
Ms. Fay said.
   Although fish now appear to be thriving in the shallowest of the
Great Lakes, Ms. Fay said the bottom of Lake Erie and its
tributaries has sediments contaminated with such materials as
mercury and cancer-causing PCBs.
   Funding for research and cleanup on the Great Lakes has been
decreasing, she said, even though contaminated sediments are a more
chronic problem than phosphates.
   ``I hate to see people sit back and rest on their laurels,'' Ms.
Fay said. ``We've really come a long way, but the toxic problem is
something we really can't see. Some of the effects are really going
to be subtle. We might have lower reproductive efficiency of
walleye or darter, but we're not going to see that for a while.''
   The Cuyahoga River, which has ignited three times since 1936,
remains an area of concern, along with several other Lake Erie
shipping channels, because of the pollutants that have settled on
the bottom.
   The International Joint Commission on Great Lakes Water Quality,
in a 1987 report, said sediments in the Cuyahoga are tainted with
PCBs, ammonia, cyanide and lead.
   Because of the contaminants, the Ohio Department of Health
advises people not to eat catfish caught in the channel and carp
caught in the open waters of Lake Erie, said Deborah Gray, a
toxicologist in the Division of Epidemiology.
   Catfish and carp feed on the bottom of Lake Erie, she said, and
tests have shown that nearly half have PCB concentrations that
exceed levels recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   The Health Department also has issued an advisory for all fish
caught in the Black River in Lorain and the Ashtabula River in
Ashtabula, which empty into Lake Erie. There is no advisory for the
Cuyahoga.
   ``An advisory is just that _ an advisory,'' she said. ``We're
talking about a very small incremental risk to someone who would
eat this fish. But what we're saying is that there are still fish
exceeding the FDA limit and we think people should know about
this.''
   But shallow Lake Erie is cleaner than many of the Great Lakes,
largely because it is is able to flush itself every 2.6 years,
officials said. The flush time for some of the upper lakes, which
are 1,000 feet deep, is more than a century. Ms. Fay said Lake Erie
also has more organic substances that bind up toxic materials.
   Bob Wysenski, environmental scientist for the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, said Ohio's beaches generally are safer for
swimming now than at any time in the past decade.
   He cited water quality statistics at 20 Lake Erie beaches that
show a general downward trend in fecal coliform, a bacteria that
can cause flu-like symptoms or ear and eye infections.
   There have been no documented cases of severe illnesses caused
by swimming in Lake Erie in the past decade, he said.
