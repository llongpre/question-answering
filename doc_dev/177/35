   The Canadian government proposed measures to reduce high Great Lakes water levels that are causing heavy damage to shoreline property in the U.S. and Canada. 

   The proposals include removal of landfill in the Niagara River, which links Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. 
Environment Minister Tom McMillan also proposed an increased flow of water from Lake Erie through the Black Rock Canal, which runs along the U.S. shore of the upper Niagara River. 

   The minister said the Canadian government "is committed to doing everything in its power to combat the problem of high water levels on the Great Lakes." 
Even with normal precipitation, he warned that "dangerously high levels will persist on Lakes Michigan, Huron, St. Clair and Erie for at least another two to three years." 
Lake St. Clair is between Lake Huron and Lake Erie. 

   In the past 150 years, landfill by private property owners has blocked as much as 40% of the Niagara River bed in some locations, restricting water flow into Lake Ontario. 
Mr. McMillan's landfill-removal proposal requires the consent of Ontario's provincial government. 

   In Washington, a State Department official said the U.S. hasn't received Canada's proposal to increase the water flow through the Black Rock Canal. 
Mr. McMillan said the flow could be increased by 1,200 cubic feet a second, an increase of less than 1% of the total average water flow between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. 

   The International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canadian agency, also is expected to recommend later this year various measures to relieve the high-water problem, which has caused several hundred million dollars worth of damage in recent years. 

   Mr. McMillan indicated that the commission may recommend, among other things, an increased diversion of water out of Lake Michigan at Chicago. 
The diversion, which moves Great Lakes water to the Mississippi River system, is currently limited by a Supreme Court order to 3,200 cubic feet a second. 
Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.) has introduced legislation that would allow the Chicago water diversion to be increased to 10,000 cubic feet a second. 

   Lakeshore property owners also have been campaigning for a halt to a Canadian diversion of about 5,600 cubic feet a second of water into Lake Superior from hydroelectric dams in Ontario, but the provincial government has opposed changing those flows. 
Mr. McMillan asked the Ontario government to reconsider its position so that Canada will be able to respond immediately to any recommendations by the International Joint Commission. 

   U.S. and Canadian hydrologists, meanwhile, said that changes in existing water diversions will have only a small impact on water levels.
