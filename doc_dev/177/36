   A toxic chemical spill snaking its way
toward Lake Erie on Thursday forced the evacuation of hundreds of
people and fouled drinking water for at least 22,000 along the
Sandusky River.
   At least three people were treated for injuries after an
estimated 100,000 gallons of toluene, an octane enhancer, spilled
Wednesday from a ruptured Sun Co. pipeline south of here.
   Five hundred people, including 300 residents of Old Fort, 10
miles to the south, were evacuated Wednesday and Thursday because
of the fumes.
   ``It could get worse,'' said Sandusky County Sheriff Dave
Gangwer. ``It depends on how slow it moves, and it's slowing down
rapidly.''
   The spill reached Fremont late Thursday, and the city stopped
pumping water from the river, officials said. They estimated a
14-mile section of the river was contaminated; the river was
flowing at about 1 mph.
   Officials fear the spill killed up to 1,000 fish, many of them
under ice, in Sugar Creek and the Sandusky River, and could affect
waterfowl, said Mike Taylor, a wildlife officer for the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources.
   Gov. Richard Celeste declared a state of emergency for Sandusky
County, which includes Fremont. The declaration makes state
assistance available.
   About 4 million gallons of water, one day's normal supply, was
put in reserve tanks before the spill arrived, said Gary
Rathfelder, assistant superintendent of Fremont's water plant.
   Toluene is a flammable chemical that can produce irritating or
poisonous gases, according to an emergency response guidebook
published by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
   The spill was detected around 6 p.m. Wednesday after Sun workers
noticed that pressure had dropped in the pipeline, which carries
the chemical from a Sun oil refinery in Toledo to a refinery in
Marcus Hook, Pa.
   Sonya Elam, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Disaster Services Agency,
said the chemical spilled in a swampy area in Seneca County, south
of Fremont, population 22,000, and then leaked into Sugar Creek, a
tributary of the Sandusky River. The Sandusky River flows north
into Lake Erie, 10 miles north of here.
   Ms. Elam said Ohio Environmental Protection Agency workers were
building a road into the swampy area and setting up a dike to
contain the chemical.
   Bob Arnet, an environmental safety coordinator for the Tulsa,
Okla.-based Sun Pipe Line, said authorities had not located the
leak.
   ``It's been shut off, but it's still leaking,'' Arnet said.
   Neither EPA nor Sun officials could estimate how much of the
chemical had entered the Sandusky River.
   Two emergency workers were treated at Tiffin Mercy Hospital
after they fell through ice and into contaminated water, while a
volunteer firefighter was treated after inhaling the fumes. All
were subsequently released.
   Bud Davis, a corporate spokesman for Sun, said the company would
take ``liability and responsibility for the leak.''
   Jack Fox, operations manager for Sun Pipe Line, a Sun Co.
subsidiary, said the source of the leak was an 18-inch split in the
pipeline, which is buried 3{ feet deep and carries the chemical
from northwest Ohio to a refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa.
   The cleanup could cost as much as $1 million and last three to
four months, Davis said.
   EPA officials said they believed much of the chemical would
dissipate by the time it reaches Lake Erie.
   Don Higgins, environmental coordinator for the Ohio EPA, said he
did not expect lasting environmental problems, but added, ``I
expect quite a bit of environmental impact on Sugar Creek.''
   ``It's not the kind of stuff you want in a river,'' he said.
``It won't kill you, but you don't want to be around it for too
long.''
