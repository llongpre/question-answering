"buckminsterfullerenes," shaped like hollow soccer balls.; 2. Advances in gene
therapy: First treatments attempted in humans. Defective cystic fibrosis genes
repaired in the test tube.; 3. Two more detectors join the search for elusive
particles called solar neutrinos.; 4. Genetically engineered hormone used to
stimulate milk production in cows is cleared as a human health risk, but still
faces stiff opposition.; 5. Powerful new drugs, such as Prozac, are making a
difference for people with depression.; 6. Scientists at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory make a light, airy substance called aerogel, which looks
like frozen smoke and may be a good insulator.; 7. Laser beams are used as
mini-tweezers to snip chromosomes and move individual molecules.; 8. Gigantic
gene for neurofibromatosis, or Von Recklinghausen disease, is cloned.; 9.
Significant progress made in understanding how proteins interact with genes to
turn them on and off.; 10. New data from the Cosmic Background Explorer
satellite shed light on the nature of the universe.;  Discover magazine; 1.
Autopsies of alcoholics reveal unusual version of the gene for a certain
chemical receptor in their brain cells, supporting the idea that alcoholism
may be hereditary.; 2. Advances in gene therapy. See No. 2 above. (Only item
on both lists.); 3. Zebra mussels invade Great Lakes, clogging inlets and
pipelines.; 4. British researchers find genetic switch that determines if a
baby will be a boy or a girl.; 5. Physicists develop computer processor that
uses laser beams instead of electrons to carry information.; 6. Mathematicians
offer proof that it takes precisely seven shuffles to mix a deck of cards.; 7.
Oil spills continue at average levels -- proving the world has learned nothing
from the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster.; 8. First AIDS death is traced back to an
ex-sailor in Manchester, England, in 1959.; 9. Space news: Hubble Space
