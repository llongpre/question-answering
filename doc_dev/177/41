   Ron Refsnider, a staff biologist for the federal Department of
the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service in Minneapolis, says
several states have laws governing mussel shells, although they are
inconsistent and vary widely.
   Refsnider says it's unlikely the agency will impose quotas or
restrict shelling, even though 25 species of mussels are on the
endangered list and 75 species are candidates.
   ``If anything regarding the threat to mussels is overstated,''
Refsnider says, ``it's the ease of solving the problem.
   ``Mussels are very good indicators of the biological health of
an ecosystem. A lot of factors have contributed to the very serious
mussel decline. It would cost millions of dollars to solve, and no
one is certain as to the cause.''
   Mussels don't help their cause any, Refsnider says, because they
are ``not a real charismatic species.'' They have largely been
ignored except for their commercial value.
   Mussels and their smaller cousins, clams, long have had
commercial value. American Indians collected them, ate the meat and
used the shells as ornaments. Prospectors set off ``pearl rushes''
on mussels in the 19th century, and in 1891 the pearl button
industry was launched using discarded shells.
   Development of plastics in the 1920s killed the pearl button
industry, and mussels had relative peace until water pollution
started taking its toll in the 1950s.
   The spread of mussels also was restricted by construction of
locks and dams as well as by declines in certain species of fish
that carry embryonic mussels like hitchhikers up and down river
systems.
   Recent studies about mussel die-offs in American rivers over the
past five years have focused on an invasion of disease-carrying
Asiatic clams. No matter the cause, their loss trickles down
through the ecosystem. Rivers become more polluted without nature's
filters, and wildlife that once fed on the little creatures are
driven from the area in their search for food.
   Proposals to save freshwater mussels and clams in the United
States have ranged from federal import taxes on pearls, mussel
harvest quotas, shorter shelling seasons and a ban on exporting raw
shells. But the solution most exciting to Sparks is creation of
river sanctuaries for endangered mussels.
   Seven sites along the Illinois side of the Mississippi River
have been proposed as sanctuaries, where scientists would have
unrestricted access to study mussels and clams.
   ``Sanctuaries are urgently needed on the Mississippi River,''
Sparks says. ``We have several endangered species which we must
save.''
   But Latendresse is not impressed with the sanctuary idea.
   ``Several states have created sanctuaries, but they don't follow
up with research funds to study the mussels so the sanctuaries are
worthless,'' he says. ``There's so much money to be made, the
shellers harvest them out of the sanctuaries.''
