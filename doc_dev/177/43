   The zonies and zdonks are sure bets, but
the aoudads were nothing but trouble, says a man who wants to make
a business out of exotic livestock.
   ``Believe me, away from here it's a good business. I just hope
to make it a good business here,'' said farmer Glawson Gantt.
   Gantt makes his living selling ordinary horses, cattle and
donkeys on his north Louisiana farm. But he expects to expand his
line within the next year.
   The 57-year-old entrepreneur, who already had buffaloes, llamas,
buzzards, peacocks and pheasants on his farm, bought two zebra
stallions at an exotic animal auction and plans to breed them to
his donkeys and Shetland ponies. The resulting animals will be
zdonks and zonies, Gantt said.
   ``Don't just everybody want a zebra,'' Gantt said recently.
``They're mean as Satan and if you take out after them there isn't
a fence that can hold them. But you mix them with a donkey or
Shetland pony and what you get is as sweet as can be.''
   The half-Shetland pony hybrid will sell for $1,500, the
donkey-zebra cross will go for up to $3,500, Gantt said.
   Although you won't find these animals in the dictionary, the
crossbreeding of zebras to donkeys and horses has been done for
years, said David Anderson, curator at the Audubon Zoo in New
Orleans. Zoos consider the resulting animals nothing but
curiosities, he said.
   Gantt already has had success with his bobbydoes. The half
sheep, half goat can sell for up to $600. He had less luck when he
was given some aoudads, a type of African sheep with long, curved
horns.
   ``They're kind of goat-looking things and can jump 16-foot
fences,'' he said. ``We couldn't keep ours penned up. As far as I
know they're still running wild out in the woods.
   ``I keep waiting to hear about some hunter shooting a creature
that nobody can identify, but I guess they can't catch up with them
either.''
