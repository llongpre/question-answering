   Such fish as bass and lake trout would
flourish in Michigan, and the Great Lakes' shipping season would
lengthen if the greenhouse effect warms the Earth a few degrees, a
major federal study says.
   The ice season on Lake Superior would be shortened by one month
to three months, and on Lake Erie by two mohths to three months,
increasing shipping seasons there, said an unreleased Environmental
Protection Agency study that is to be submitted to the Congress in
December.
   The Associated Press obtained a draft of a summary of the
effects of global warming, which is caused by a growing
concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in
the atmosphere.
   The gases that cause the greenhouse effect are produced mainly
by the industries that have spread around the world since the
mid-19th century. Auto exhausts also contribute to the effect.
   While shipping could benefit, the higher temperatures likely
would reduce the snow pack in the Great Lakes region and increase
evaporation. That combination would reduce lake levels, possibly
necessitating dredging ports and channels, the study said.
   The water level of Lake Superior, on average, would be 1\ feet
to 1{ feet lower than now, and Lake Michigan's water level would
fall dramatically by 3 feet to 8 feet, the study said.
   The EPA study also said Michigan's hardwood forests might be
replaced by savannas and grasslands because of the greenhouse
effect, which would open Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern Michigan
to increased cultivation.
   The decline of the northern forests would become evident in 30
years to 60 years, the study said.
   The result by the middle of the 21st century will be an average
global temperature of three degrees to eight degrees Fahrenheit
higher than now, most scientists believe.
   ``Northern hardwood forests in Michigan may be reduced to oak
savannas or grasslands, and mixed boreal and northern hardwood
forests in northern Minnesota may become all northern hardwoods,''
the study said.
   The reduction in forests and increased cultivation in the north
could increase erosion and runoff, harming water quality, the study
said.
   And while some fish would thrive, a greater temperature
difference between the surface of the lakes and their depths might
reduce the amount of oxygen in the lower levels and disrupt the
annual turnover of the water, the study said.
   Fish species in shallow lakes and rivers could suffer from the
higher temperatures, the study said.
   A political effect of global warming might be increased demands
for a diversion of Great Lakes water for use outside the region,
the study said.
