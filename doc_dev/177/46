<LEADPARA>  With the help of the drought, the tiny, audacious Asian clam has taken over
northern San Francisco Bay and is advancing south, stripping the water of
nutrients and wrecking whole ecosystems.;    Scientists hope the eventual end
of the drought will stem the invasion, which started in 1986.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But they are not optimistic. The Asian clam, it turns out, is a fierce
competitor and a near-perfect feeding machine that will risk its life for a
good meal.;    It has a "very daring lifestyle for a clam," said Janet
Thompson, a biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park who has been
tracking the creature's steamroller spread down the bay.;    "They're very
well-adapted," she added. "If I were to go and design a clam, this would be
it.";    The diminutive Potamocorbula amurensis, just over an inch long, was
flushed into Carquinez Strait in the ballast water of a ship five years ago.
Since researchers had been monitoring the area's bottom-dwelling animals for
more than a decade, they noticed the invasion right away.;    It was not the
first time a new species had hitchhiked from across the world; most of the
bay's bottom-dwellers are imported, said Frederic H. Nichols, a biological
oceanographer with the USGS.;    But it was one of the most successful. Within
a year, it had taken over Suisun and San Pablo bays and was heading south,
where it has set up thriving colonies along the east shore of the bay and in
deep shipping channels between the San Mateo and Dumbarton bridges.;    The
clam had an unwitting ally in the strange weather patterns of the past few
years, Nichols told a meeting of the Geological Society of America on
Wednesday in San Francisco.;    Starting in 1984, he said, drought dried up
river flows into the North Bay, turning the water saltier and encouraging
growth of salt-loving species.;    But in early 1986, a rainy spell flooded
the area with fresh water, wiping out the salt-lovers almost overnight, he
said. Just then, the Asian clam arrived, proliferating so quickly that the
other species had no chance to make a comeback.;    While the clam has thrived
in the salty conditions of the continuing drought, lab tests indicate that
it's just as happy to live in fresh water, dampening scientists' hopes that it
will disappear when the drought ends and rivers run high again.;    "But
Mother Nature does things we don't do" in the lab, Thompson said. "When the
drought breaks, we'll know.";    Asian clams are fast and efficient feeders.
In Suisun Bay, they filter enough water every day to fill the bay, straining
out the tiny floating organisms that make up the base of the food chain and
dramatically changing the ecology.;    Diving ducks and sturgeon are feasting
on the invaders, biologists said. But striped bass and other fish may suffer
for lack of food, although right now it's hard to distinguish the effects of
the clam invasion from those of the drought.;    Thompson has developed a
grudging admiration for the creatures as she follows their spread into the
South Bay.;    So far, they show no sign of taking over there, she said,
possibly because the bottom is already covered with a thick, thriving
community of clams, worms and crustaceans.;    But Thompson said the clams'
lifestyle makes them formidable, and it will take at least six more months of
monitoring to determine how far they are likely to spread.;    The clams
settle on the bottom in the middle of the fastest currents and anchor
themselves with protein fibers, similar to the "beards" of mussels, stuck far
into the mud or sand.;    While other clams play it safe, burying themselves
in the mud to hide from predators, the Asian clams poke boldly out into the
water and stretch out their siphons to suck in the maximum amounts of water
and food.  </TEXT>
