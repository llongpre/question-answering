   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Eagles fly again above the Great Lakes, but they
are dying faster than they can reproduce. The majestic birds are
victims of high levels of the same poisons that wiped them out of
the area 20 years ago.

   More than two decades after the oily
Cuyahoga River caught fire, after Lake Erie was declared dead and
DDT was banned, eagles again soar above the Great Lakes.
   They are not doing well.
   Yearly, they return to try to colonize the contaminated
shoreline. And yearly, scientist Bill Bowerman climbs to their
nests to remove the unhatched eggs.
   In the dead embryos and in the blood of surviving eaglets, the
Michigan State University researcher sees high levels of the same
poisons that wiped eagles out of the Great Lakes 20 years ago.
   The birds are dying faster than they can reproduce, Bowerman
says. For them and more than a dozen other animals that feed on
Great Lakes fish, the shore is a zone of death and deformity.
   It's a red flag warning, Bowerman says, ``a sign of what's
happening to everything in the food chain.''
   The bald eagle is a perfect example, said Conservation
Foundation researcher Dr. Theodore Colborn in Washington, D.C.
   Up and down the inland sea, from cold, deep Lake Superior to the
roiling St. Lawrence River, wildlife scientists tell of shore birds
born with twisted beaks, clubfeet and stomachs outside their
bodies. They tell of whales wracked with cancers and diseases, of
expanses of beach where mink have vanished, and of eagles that can
barely reproduce.
   In a report to the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission
last year, Colborn listed 16 predator species whose shoreline
populations have dropped in association with high toxin levels.
   The killer is silent. Pesticides such as DDT, mirex and dieldrin
and toxins such as PCBs and dioxin persist in the mucky lake
sediments despite 20 years of cleanup efforts.
   The toxins are picked up by worms and leeches and travel up the
food chain, from smelt to trout to gulls to eagles. The
concentrations of poisons increase 10 times at each level.
   Contamination levels vary from lake to lake, but there are
basin-wide warnings for humans to limit the sizes and kinds of
Great Lakes fish they eat.
   Fish contamination in some areas has dropped because of controls
and bans on toxins pumped into the lakes by industry. Researchers
say it will be a century or two before the vast lakes shed the
poisons they have absorbed.
   Meanwhile, the eagles try to return.
   Bowerman's research shows Michigan eagles on lakes Michigan and
Huron are reproducing at less than half the rate of those who nest
inland.
   A pair must raise one chick a year to keep the population
stable. Lake Huron eagles have one chick for every three nests.
After five years of eating Great Lakes fish _ the time when inland
birds reach their reproductive peak _ shore bird reproduction in
Michigan falls to one chick for every seven nests.
   Wisconsin's only Lake Michigan eagle nest, near Green Bay, has
not produced a chick in four years. Another pair on the Straits of
Mackinac near St. Ignace has not produced a chick in eight years.
   In the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan's untamed Upper
Peninsula, prime eagle territory, seven shoreline eagle pairs went
three years before one of them produced a chick this year.
   The eagle has made a remarkable comeback inland. Michigan, with
150 inland nesting pairs, has surpassed its federally set goal of
140 pairs. Minnesota reports 390 inland pairs and Wisconsin has
336, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In the three
states, the eagle is classified as threatened, not endangered.
   Bowerman believes that as those healthy eagles fly to the shore,
their stunted efforts to reproduce are sapping the entire
population.
   There are no nests on Lake Ontario, the most contaminated of the
Great Lakes. The Canadian side of Lake Huron is barren. Five of the
eight U.S. Great Lakes states _ Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania,
New York and Minnesota _ have no eagles on their shores.
   ``There's some beautiful land there,'' Bowerman said. ``I don't
know why. I don't know what the flow is from the pulp mills in
Canada. I don't know where it's all coming from.''
   He lost nine nests on Lake Superior this year. The parent birds
have vanished.
   Tim Kubiak of the Fish and Wildlife Service in Lansing said the
eagles' problems are a sign of the poor health of the entire Great
Lakes basin, the world's largest freshwater system.
   ``Growth problems, retardation, smaller head sizes, lower birth
rates ... we see it in mink, the birds,'' Kubiak said. They are
clues to the health of shore-dwelling humans.
   The toxic problems show no signs of abating.
   This spring, a research team found 22 deformities in cormorant
chicks in Wisconsin's Green Bay colony _ a deformity rate of 1 in
72 where 1 in 10,000 would be the norm.
   Last year, Bowerman tested a Saginaw Bay eaglet with 2.25 parts
per million of PCBs in its blood. The 5-week-old Lake Huron chick
carried contamination 100 times higher than inland eaglets.
   Like other Great Lakes researchers of terns and whales and mink,
Bowerman is unable to say what the toxins actually do inside the
bodies of their subjects.
   ``We're seeing messages from the environment, indications that
there are problems,'' New York biologist Robert Foley said. His
work shows elevated PCB concentrations in Lake Ontario mink _ when
he can find them. He thinks the toxins and the population problems
are related, but he has yet to prove it.
   Eight years of analyzing the blubber of dead beluga whales
beached in the St. Lawrence River have given Canadian researcher
Pierre Beland a chemical catalog of the lakes.
   The dead whales' ailments run an odd list of cancers and
diseases previously unseen in belugas. Yet Beland cannot explain
what is happening to the living whales. Why do some of them have
bent spines? Why are St. Lawrence belugas failing to recover
despite a ban on commercial hunting?
   ``We're simply hoping the population will hold out until things
get cleaner,'' he said.
