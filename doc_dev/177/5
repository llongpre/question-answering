   Could it be that the hated zebra mussel isn't
all bad?
   Soviet scientists apparently think so, says an Environmental
Protection Agency official who is planning to visit Moscow next
month in search of ideas for battling the tiny mollusks.
   Officials are frantically searching for a way to prevent
infestation of the Great Lakes by the pesky mussels, with their
zebra-like stripes.
   Valdas V. Adamkus, the EPA's national program manager for the
Great Lakes, said Wednesday he had received some papers from Soviet
scientists who earlier notified him they had developed a biological
method of attacking the pest.
   Zebra mussels breed rapidly and attach themselves to municipal
water intake pipes.
   Much to his surprise, however, the papers said nothing about
ways to eradicate the mussel, Adamkus said. Instead, they described
the creature as useful because it can help control water pollution.
   ``They proved through their scientific work that zebra mussels
can be a cleansing agent,'' he said. ``So instead of trying to
reduce them, they are actually trying to ... increase their
population.
   ``We were surprised,'' he said. ``We're trying to eliminate the
zebra mussels and they are actually using them as an agent for
purification of water.''
   How the mussels could clean dirty water isn't clear, Adamkus
said. But the report has made him all the more eager to visit the
Soviet Union.
   ``I'm going to call on all the available scientists over there,
meet with them, get any information or whatever scientific work or
literature is available,'' he said.
   Last summer, the mussels clogged the water intake pipe of
Monroe, Mich., restricting the flow through the 6,000-foot pipe by
nearly 24 percent.
   Zebra mussels originated in Eastern Europe's freshwater seas and
are believed to have entered the Great Lakes in the ballast water
of oceangoing vessels.
   They showed up in Lake St. Clair in 1987 and rapidly infested
Lake Erie. They have been spotted from Duluth, Minn., to New York.
   In a related development, the House Appropriations Committee
voted Wednesday to spend $1 million for zebra mussel research at
the Great Lakes Research Laboratory at Ann Arbor.
   Another $3 million for zebra mussel study was reserved, pending
completion of legislation to authorize the Sea Grant program, said
Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., a committee member.
   The panel also set aside $1.4 million to combat the sea lamprey,
another Great Lakes pest.
