<TEXT>     Sixteen assault victims and relatives and supporters of murder victims
attended Tuesday's hearings. Scott said seven spoke against parole for Moore
and three made statements against releasing Cooks.;    Fourteen white people
were killed and eight others injured during the series of attacks that
panicked San Francisco residents during the winter of 1973-74. The victims
were shot, stabbed and, in the case of one woman, beheaded with a machete.;   
The slayings were dubbed the "Zebra" killings because police used a separate
Z, or Zebra, radio band during their investigation of the slayings.  </TEXT>
