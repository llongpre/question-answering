<TEXT>     Discovery of a gene linked to alcoholism?;    Embarrassing flaws in the
Hubble Space Telescope?;    The envelope, please. And the answer is -- all
three.;    When it comes to rating the discoveries that shape our lives, the
nation's leading scientists and journalists disagree. Not only did they pick
radically different candidates as story of the year, but their lists of the
top 10 stories have almost nothing in common.;    Science, a respected journal
that announces breakthroughs in a wide range of fields, said the top story was
recent progress in making artificial diamond, which it named "Molecule of the
Year." Although the advances didn't make headlines -- indeed, they were pretty
much ignored by the press -- they could lead to faster electronic chips,
scratch-proof windows and tools that never need sharpening.;    Meanwhile,
Discover, a popular science magazine with a circulation of 1.1 million, chose
as its top story a study on the brains of alcoholics, which found certain
genes for chemical receptors that support the idea that alcoholism may be
hereditary. But even before the December issue hit the newsstands, the finding
was contradicted by another study that found no such thing.;    For Tom
Siegfried, the award-winning science editor of the Dallas Morning News, the
biggest story was the Hubble flop.;    What gives?;    Maybe scientists and
reporters are so different that their tastes will never coincide. Or, more
troubling, perhaps reporters are passing up solid science developments in
favor of flashy headlines.;    Regardless, the discrepancy reveals how hard it
is to identify news in the ever-changing world of science, whose discoveries
are announced in nearly 74,000 journals published all over the world. As
Siegfried points out in a recent column, if each of these journals published
only one important paper per year, they would amount to 200 science news
stories per day.;    The Science Top 10 for 1990 was selected by researchers
on the journal's board, according to editor Daniel E. Koshland Jr., a
biochemist at the University of California, Berkeley. He said they looked for
items that are about to blossom into major developments.;    Highlights
include the introduction of powerful mood-altering drugs such as Prozac and
the invention of extremely light substances, called aerogels, at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory.;    "All of them were based on solid scientific
discoveries," Koshland said.;    Discover's Top 10 includes the Hubble's
troubles and the invasion of the Great Lakes by pesky zebra mussels.
Editor-in-chief Paul Hoffman said his personal favorite was a finding by
mathematicians that it takes exactly seven shuffles to mix a deck of cards.;  
 "It's not that we were discounting key lab breakthroughs," Hoffman said. "We
focused a little bit more on developments that affect peoples' lives . . .
stories that have really hit the news and captured the public's attention.";  
 The lists have only one item in common -- gene therapy, which was used in
humans for the first time in 1990.;    "I do think there's a very wide bit of
country between what gets played journalistically and what scientists think is
important," said Victor McElheny, director of the Knight Science Journalism
Fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former science
writer for the New York Times.;    "Obviously the Discover list is more
thrills and chills, and the Science list is more things that mean some
intellectual challenge and/or give the promise of significant benefit to large
numbers of people.";    If asked to draw up its own list, McElheny said, the
public might come up with something completely different, "things like the
spotted owl and global warming. They might give you a list of issues that
worry them, like genetic engineering or surrogate motherhood.";    John
Wilkes, director of the graduate program in science communications at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, said the same thing happens in jazz
music polls: Musicians and fans inevitably pick different jazz artists as
their favorites.;    "It's clear that the real (science) news is not reaching
the public," he added. "Whether it ever will is something that remains to be
seen. It's going to depend on science writers doing a better job."  </TEXT>
