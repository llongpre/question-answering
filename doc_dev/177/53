  [Abstract] Dumping of anthropogenic materials including 
many toxic and mutagenic ones into the Kerch Straight, one of 
the most biologically productive areas of the Black Sea region, 
not only disrupts benthic biocoenoses, mussel banks, and 
traditional paths of fish migration but also causes a problem of 
contamination. The worst offenders are fine-disperse particles 
of contaminated soil, mainly aleurite and pelite. It therefore 
has been necessary to monitor the toxicity of the Kerch Straight 
ecosystem. Until 1989 this was done in shallow water on the 
Savenko bank or in an experimental dump site. Since then 
materials are being sampled in the mussel yard near cape Tuzla. 
During the 1989-90 period samples were taken, among others, for 
the purpose of determining the contamination of mollusks by 
organic chlorine compounds: 1),2) 
(_a_,_g_)-hexachlorocyclohexane, 3) DDT with its metabolites 
and 
polychlorobiphenyls. The specimens were analyzed by the method 
of gas-liquid chromatography in a ``Yanako'' G-180 F.E. 
instrument. During the March-April 1989 period of slow 
physiological mussel activity and low phytoplankton vegetation 
intensity the ratio of maximum to minimum pesticide 
concentrations in water and in mussel clusters was found to be 
most stable, owing to slowness of fermentation and of 
biochemical reactions in mollusks. No polychlorobiphenyls were 
found in the water during that period, evidently due to the 
effective action of DDT combined with fast cementation and 
subsequent fast sedimentation of particles. During the 
March-August 1990 period of massive soil dumping the 
concentrations of those compounds in both surface and bottom 
layers in three sampling sites were respectively: 1) 0.041 and 
0.044 mg/liter, 2) 0.026 and 0.027 mg/liter, 3) 0.020 and 0.024 
mg/liter. The absence of polychlorobiphenyls facilitates massive 
accumulation of insoluble organic chlorine compounds and their 
adsorption by particles suspended in deeper water. Their spatial 
overall distribution of organic chlorine indicates that they do 
not spread far to the north into shallow shelf water. Figures 2;
