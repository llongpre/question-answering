   Drought has reduced the expected fall duck
migration to the second smallest on record and could mean a 25
percent reduction in hunting this year, federal wildlife officials
say.
   The migration will total about 66 million ducks, according to
biologists of the Fish and Wildlife Service. Only 1985's estimated
migration of 62 million was lower, and last year's was a hopeful 74
million.
   All the decline will come in the Central and Mississippi flyways
because of steady loss of marshy breeding areas in the northern
plains states and southern Canada in the 1980s. The flight on the
Atlantic and Pacific flyways should be unchanged from last year.
   The service has been warning for weeks that major new
restrictions probably will be needed for hunting seasons starting
in October.
   States are in charge of actual hunting regulations, but they
must choose from possibilities set out by the service. Early-season
guidelines for hunting the blue-winged teal in September call for
no season at all in 13 Central and Mississippi flyway states.
   Regular-season guidelines will be decided upon next week after a
public hearing in Washington. Advisory committees meeting in Denver
on Monday were asked to discuss a 25 percent cutback in the number
of days during which duck hunting is allowed, a reduction in bag
limits from the typical four to three and an early closing of the
season on Jan. 1 instead of Jan. 20, said Megan Durham, spokeswoman
for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
   It isn't just this year's drought that has reduced breeding
activity in the marshes. There have been many dry years in this
decade, allowing farming to be extended into areas previously too
wet for crops, particularly in Canada.
   Surveys released last week showed record numbers of ducks in
northern Canada and Alaska, with populations up 9 percent there.
Those ducks couldn't find suitable areas farther south, and the
longer flights may have tired them too much to breed, biologists
fear.
   Overall, the census by U.S. and Canadian biologists showed the
breeding populations of 10 major species down 3.7 percent from last
year and 17 percent from the 1955-1987 average. There were only
2.58 million Northern pintail ducks, 18 percent fewer than last
year and 54 percent below average.
   Mallards in southern Saskatchewan fell below 1 million for the
first time.
   ``Biologists are beginning to worry that continued low water
conditions in the areas waterfowl use for migration stopovers and
wintering will concentrate the birds and make them more vulnerable
to disease later this year,'' the service said.
   Frank Dunkle, director of the service, was quoted as expecting
increased emphasis on management of wetlands for waterfowl as
provided for under the 1986 ``North American Plan'' agreement with
Canada, because such areas in many cases have provided the only
relief for drought-stressed waterfowl.
   Some other findings from the survey:
   _The Platte River in Nebraska has been turned into a ``river of
sand,'' exposing the nesting piping plover and the interior least
tern to threats of predators and death of aquatic food species.
   _Geese are faring better than ducks, since they nest on more
permanent wetlands and are better able to protect their young from
predators.
   _Flows of tributaries to the Great Lakes are so low biologists
cannot safely apply chemicals to control lamprey, which prey on
lake trout. Dredging necessitated by low water will spread
contaminated bottom sediment, threatening other aquatic life.
   _The acorn crop from oak trees in the Midwest and South could be
a near-total failure without major rain soon, spelling problems for
deer, squirrels and wild turkeys dependent on acorns for food.
   _Pheasant, quail and grouse, though doing well in Kansas and
Nebraska now, could be hurt next winter and spring through
drought-caused loss of food and cover. Poor production of pheasant,
grouse and Hungarian partridge is expected in the Dakotas.
   _Some fish won't spawn in the upper Mississippi and Missouri
rivers because of low water, and high temperatures in the Dakotas
has eliminated or reduced production of walleye, northern pike,
smallmouth bass and largemouth bass at federal hatcheries.
