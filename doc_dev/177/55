<TEXT>     "It seems so callous that we go before the parole board on the exact
anniversary of Nick's death," Jeanne Shields said Monday, "but perhaps it is
appropriate to emphasize that his alleged killer, J.C.X. Simon, be denied
parole. I don't want justice tempered with mercy.";    Agnos a survivor; 
Several survivors of the bloody crime spree -- including San Francisco Mayor
Art Agnos -- and many relatives of the victims who died plan to testify at the
Vacaville hearing. Before 1982, the state did not give victims of crimes and
their family members the legal right to do so.;    "In this case, many of the
surviving victims of the Zebra killers and family and friends of Zebra victims
were unaware of their right to participate in the parole process," said Beth
Baier of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, a Los Angeles-based law firm representing many of
the Zebra victims and family members.;    "Once informed of their rights,
however," she said, "they have been eager to oppose the parole of the four
Zebra killers, who wreaked such havoc on their lives.";    The Zebra killers
-- Simon, Manuel Moore, Jesse Lee Cooks and Larry Green -- did not receive
murder convictions for all 14 murders, including that of Nick Shields. But
each was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder and conspiracy
to commit first-degree murder.;    Terror in 1973, '74;  The Zebra killers
were members of a black cult called the "Death Angels," which advocated the
random killing of whites. The four assailants terrorized the city in late 1973
and early 1974.;    Agnos, who was working in Leo McCarthy's race for the
state Assembly in 1973, was shot twice in the chest and lost his spleen.;   
Authorities dubbed the killings Zebra after converting the "Z" band of the
police radio to carrying information on the murders.;    On Monday, one victim
who survived being shot twice in the back, RoxAnn McMillian, and the relatives
of several murder victims held an emotional press conference in San
Francisco.;    McMillian, sitting in a wheelchair, recalled how she was moving
to a new apartment on Jan. 18. 1974, when a man greeted her by saying, "Hi,"
and then shot her.;    "My son was only 4 months old when I was shot," she
said. "For almost half of his first year, I was in the hospital, unable to
care for him. I never did get to push him in his new baby stroller.;    "I
know I am lucky to have survived the shooting . . . but I live every day with
pain and sorrow for the loss of living as an able-bodied person. . . .
(Simon's) life sentence should mean just that -- a life sentence. My life
sentence is this wheelchair.";    "Why should we believe that Simon and the
others won't resume their terroristic acts if they are released?" said George
Holly, whose wife, Jane, was shot and killed in a laundromat. "Anyone that
kills for joy rather than just survival deserves to be caged. And no matter
how docile when caged, it shall surely kill again.";    "Simon and the others
gave up their claim to humanity when they crossed the line of moral decency to
commit such heinous crimes," said Holly's son, Steven.;    Steven Holly said
everything has a purpose, and that his mother's murder "was to help put an end
to the actions of J.C.X. Simon and his co-conspirators.";    Simon has tried
for parole -- and failed -- five times. The last hearing was in April 1988.
Green, 39, who is serving his time with Simon at California Medical Facility
South, has been denied parole six times.;    Moore and Cooks, both 46 years
old and at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo County, have been
turned down five times.  </TEXT>
