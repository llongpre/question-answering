IMPERFECT FANTASY

From the beginning I was captivated by the auditory and visual experience of 
"Fantasia." I could imagine a kindly and wise Uncle Walt, orchestrating his 
vision of a world where music and life supersede all other petty concerns. 
</P>
<P>
This pleasant mood was shattered by a thunderbolt about two-thirds into the 
film when, in a pastoral scene set to Beethoven's Sixth Symphony, I briefly 
glimpsed two zebra-striped, brown-skinned female centaurs serving a fat little 
Caucasian cherub as if they were his slaves. They never joined the party. In 
fact, they were present for no more than three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Before this instance I had regarded the other centaurs, enjoying their 
courtship rituals, as non-racial pink, blue, orange and green. However, after 
this moment the vision became a white folks' party with blacks -- or 
brown-skinned centaurs with clearly African zebra bodies -- present only to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
Was this Disney's vision of Utopia? I don't think a black person, or a centaur 
of African descent, could be happy there. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on the film lost all of its magic. Those tiny two or three 
seconds completely decolorized the film, making it a very worldly black and 
white.

According to Charles Solomon, who wrote "It Wasn't Always Magic," an Oct. 7 
article on "Fantasia": In the original version the two Nubian/zebra 
centaurettes who attend Bacchus in the Pastoral Symphony sequence appeared on 
screen somewhat longer and, later, a black centaurette called Sunflower buffed 
the hooves of the other centaurettes. All of Sunflower's scenes have been 
excised in recent reissues to avoid offending modern sensibilities. The 
presence of Bacchus' attendants has been cut to a minimum; removing their 
entrance entirely would have damaged the storyline.
