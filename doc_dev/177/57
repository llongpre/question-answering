   Does Nessie, Scotland's fabled Loch Ness
monster, have a cousin?
   A handful of sightings of huge serpentlike creatures in Lake
Erie were recorded in 1985 and 1987. But things remained quiet
until Sept. 4.
   That's when Harold Bricker and his family returned from a
fishing trip with a new sighting, and monster mania began spreading
along lakefront communities.
   The Brickers said they saw a large creature moving in the water
about 1,000 feet from their boat. They described it as black, about
35 feet long and with a snakelike head. It moved as fast as their
boat.
   ``I told my son that I wanted to get a look at it,'' the
67-year-old Bricker said. ``My son said, `No way, that thing is
bigger than we are.' So we stayed where we were.''
   Bricker, his wife, Cora, and son, Robert, told rangers at East
Harbor State Park about what they'd seen.
   The creature has since been reported by five people on three
separate occasions, including a Huron firefighter and a 50-year-old
woman from Pennsylvania vacationing at her Lake Erie cottage.
   John Schaffner, editor of a weekly newspaper in Port Clinton,
has set up a toll-free phone for people to call if they see the
serpent.
   He also ran a contest to name it. South Bay Besse was chosen in
part because of the location of the Davis Besse nuclear power plant
near Port Clinton - not to mention that Besse rhymes with
``Nessie.''
   The story of the monster in Loch Ness in north-central Scotland
dates back centuries and is worth tens of millions in tourist
dollars to the region each year. Three years ago, a million-dollar
scientific expedition to find her turned up just vague sonar
readings, but the legend remains.
   Any similar effort to find a creature in Lake Erie would be even
more difficult - at 240 miles, it's more than 10 times as long as
Loch Ness.
   Thomas Solberg, owner of Huron Lagoon Marina, has offered a
$5,000 reward to anyone who captures South Bay Besse alive. He also
posted a sign at his marina calling it the future home of the Lake
Erie sea serpent.
   But while some people are having fun with the creature, marine
researchers remain skeptical.
   Fred Snyder, a researcher with the Ohio Sea Grant, an
organization that examines Great Lakes issues, said it is highly
unlikely a monster is living in Lake Erie.
   He added that he's ``not trying to be the sour old guy who
throws a bucket of water on things'' and loves stories about the
Loch Ness monster.
   But he noted that Loch Ness is old, while Lake Erie is a
youngster, geologically speaking.
   ``A lot of people kind of assume, like most places in the world,
it must be millions and millions of years old,'' he said. ``It's
not the case. The glaciers receded and the area stabilized about
12,000 years ago, which, geologically, is just yesterday.
   ``So the monster really can't be anything left over from the
dinosaur days, because it's just too young.''
   Snyder also noted that no sightings were reported before the
mid-1980s. And he said he doubts a big sea creature could have
gotten in from the Atlantic Ocean because of the difficulties of
navigating the St. Lawrence Seaway.
   The sturgeon, Lake Erie's largest fish, can grow to 300 pounds
and 10 feet in length, but it is on the endangered species list and
is a bottom dweller, Snyder said.
   He speculated monster sighters may have seen a school of fish
and mistakenly thought it was a creature.
   ``I truthfully don't know what people have been seeing, but it's
hard for me to believe that there could be a monster out there,''
he said.
