   Small, striped aliens that stowed away on
European freighters are threatening the security of North America's
waterways, warn lawmakers who fear the Great Lakes will become
mussel beaches.
   The rapid spread of the marauding mollusks led legislators
Wednesday to introduce bills aimed at preventing further aquatic
invasions and battling the one underway by the dread zebra mussel.
   Unchecked, the exotic, inedible shellfish could cause $5 billion
in damage by the turn of the century and spread to two-thirds of
the nation's waterways, said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   ``I can tell you it's no joke,'' said Glenn, who was joined at a
news conference by seven lawmakers who want the federal government
to spend $40 million to research and control the barnacle-like
creature.
   ``We don't want to look a few years from now on what we should
have spent this year,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., whose
district is bound by Lake Michigan. That lake so far is mussel-free
except for the bottom of one boat in Green Bay, Wis.
   The mussels, usually no more than 1{ inches long, are believed
to have been carried here from Eastern Europe three years ago in
the ballast water of freighters.
   They've multiplied dramatically because they spawn almost
continuously _ an adult female can produce upwards of 30,000 eggs
in a year _ and because there has been nothing to control the
spread of the alien mussels.
   An expert who investigated the problem for the Congressional
Research Service found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat
zebra mussels but warned that there may not be enough intact
wetlands to provide a habitat for more of the natural predators.
   There weren't enough predators to prevent 30 tons of mussels
from clogging a 2{-mile intake pipe at an Ontario water plant or
prevent mussels from accumulating up to two inches thick on screens
of the water intakes at five Cleveland Electric Illumination Co.
power plants.
   Monroe, Mich., was forced to close its water plant for three
days after zebra mussels restricted water flow. Detroit Edison Co.
had to reduce the output of its Monroe, Mich. plant by 25 percent
because one of its pipes became coated with the mussels.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said a $29 million breakwall that
took a decade to get for Presque Isle in Lake Erie is being
jeopardized by zebra mussels.
   And Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., warned that the shellfish can easily
migrate into the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio river systems,
which ``could become literally mussel-bound.''
   And there's more. Dead zebra mussels can produce ``offensive
quantities of methane gas,'' according to the congressional
research report. When they die in the pipes of water treatment
systems they can give the water a foul taste and smell. Once they
wash ashore, the mussels' sharp shells can rip up the bare feet of
beach walkers.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said the mussels already endanger
the fisheries of Lake Erie by stripping the lake of microscopic
feeder plants.
   When the bottom of the aquatic food chain collapses, ``the net
result is there will be no little baby fish left in Lake Erie to
grow up to be big fish,'' said Eckart, who added he's worried about
the impact on a newly revived sportfishing and recreation economy.
   ``It's another one of those unwanted foreign imports that's
costing us jobs,'' he said.
   The bills introduced by Glenn in the Senate and Rep. Henry
Nowak, D-N.Y., in the House would authorize spending $4 million a
year for five years to control the mussels and the same amount on
prevention programs to protect U.S. waters from other foreign
invaders.
   In addition, the bills require freighters to dump their ballast
water in the ocean, at least 200 miles from the U.S. coast.
