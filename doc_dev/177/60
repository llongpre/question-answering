   A Senate panel voted Thursday to slash an
administration request for additional money to tear down and rebuild
the new U.S. Embassy in Moscow, which is riddled with electronic
listening devices.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 15-0 for an
amendment offered by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut
the $270 million figure the State Department had asked for the
coming year to $50 million.
   The vote was largely symbolic because it came on legislation that
is unlikely to be enacted into law.
   However, it illustrated the continuing controversy over what to
do with the eight-story structure, suffused with Soviet listening
technology, on which the government already has spent $60 million.
   Both Democrats and Republicans on the panel, arguing in support
of Moynihan's move, said it would be a waste to tear down an nearly
completed building that could be used for other purposes for which
Soviet eavesdropping would not be a problem.
   Moynihan argued that the $50 million he left in the bill would be
enough to complete the compromised chancery building and construct a
smaller building elsewhere in the Embassy compound to house
sensitive intelligence and other secret operations.
   That idea is vigorously opposed by the State Department, which
wants to tear the chancery down to its foundation and rebuild it for
its originally planned use as the primary office building for the
complex.
   Intelligence experts, including the Senate Intelligence
Committee, have endorsed that approach as the only secure one.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee, in a separate version of the
legislation, has included the full $270 million but left open the
question of whether it would be spent on a new building or
reconstructing the present one.
   The skirmish over the Embassy building came on a measure sought
by the administration that also would authorize spending $474
million to pay past-due dues to the United Nations.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., signaled that if the measure comes to
the Senate floor he would seek to delete that money from the bill.
   In addition, the measure included a series of add-ons, most from
Democrats, to address pet concerns. The provisions included $7.4
million sought by Moynihan to control sea lampreys and zebra mussels
in the Great Lakes.
