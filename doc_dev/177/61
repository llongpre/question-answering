   A man convicted in San
Francisco's ``Zebra'' killings lost a fourth bid for freedom after
telling a parole board he will never confess to the 1970s murder
spree that left 14 people dead.
   The three-member Board of Prison Terms denied parole for Manuel
Moore, 40, after a 2{-hour hearing Tuesday at the California Men's
Colony in San Luis Obispo.
   The panel said Moore presents an unreasonable risk of danger,
and concluded that he committed the crimes in an especially
heinous, cruel, cold-blooded and calculated manner, panel member
Ray Jaurequi said.
   Another man convicted in the killings, Larry Green, faces a
parole hearing later today.
   The panel characterized the crimes as a murderous rampage that
terrorized the San Francisco Bay area.
   Moore, who is serving a life term and cannot seek parole for
another three years, maintained his innocence throughout the
hearing.
   ``I'm not going to say I did something when I didn't do it,''
Moore said. ``You all can keep whipping me and whipping me, I'm not
going to submit. I don't care how much you whip me and beat me,
I'll pick myself up every time and tell you I didn't do it.''
   A prosecutor said Moore has never admitted guilt nor expressed
remorse for the random street killings of whites that left 14 dead
and eight injured in the winter of 1973-74.
   ``I have no doubt he would do it again if he was set free. This
is the same man who went out on the streets of San Francisco
shooting people. He hasn't changed,'' said Assistant District
Attorney Theresa Welch of San Francisco.
   Moore, Green, J.C. Simon and Jessie Lee Cooks were convicted in
1976 of murder, conspiracy and assault after a year-long trial.
   They were charged in only some of the Zebra attacks, but all 14
murders and eight assaults were introduced at the yearlong trial
because of the conspiracy charges. All received life sentences.
   The murder victims included a woman who was beheaded with a
machete, an 81-year-old man and a 19-year-old college student
carrying a teddy bear as a Christmas present.
   One survivor was San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, who was shot and
wounded on on Dec. 13, 1973. Agnos was a private citizen at the
time.
   The case took its name from the Z, or ``Zebra,'' police radio
frequency that was used during the investigation of the killings.
Prosecutors argued that the attacks were the work of a black racist
cult bent on slaying whites.
