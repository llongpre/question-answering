   Government biologists are discussing a 25
percent cutback in duck hunting seasons this fall, saying drought
has produced ``the worst habitat conditions'' biologists have ever
seen.
   Reduced hunting is one suggestion that advisory committees are
being asked to consider before the Fish and Wildlife Service holds
hearings early next month on guidelines for states to use in
adopting actual hunting regulations.
   Also put up for discussion, spokeswoman Megan Durham said
Monday, are a three-bird bag limit _ the typical recent limit has
been four _ and an early closing of the period when hunting is
permissible, Jan. 1 instead of Jan. 20.
   In other drought-related activity in Washington, President
Reagan wrote key members of agriculture committees in Congress on
Monday that some features of a bipartisan drought relief bill for
farmers might violate principles he believes should be followed.
   The president did not say specifically what troubled him, but
during a tour of drought-stricken corn and soybean producing areas
in southern Illinois earlier this month, Reagan voiced concern that
the relief package might take on the appearance of a ``Christmas
tree,'' in which lawmakers attach favored amendments on legislation
they know will pass the Congress.
   The advisory committees' discussion is beginning with a
prediction by the Fish and Wildlife Service that the fall duck
migration will total 66 million ducks, second lowest behind only
the 62 million of 1985.
   All the reduction from last year's 74 million will come in the
Mississippi and Central flyways. The migration on the Atlantic and
Pacific flyways is expected to be unchanged.
   The service has warned several times that hunting most likely
would have to be restricted this fall, not only because of this
year's drought but also because of drought throughout most of the
1980s in the marshy breeding areas of Canada and the northern
plains states.
   The early-season guidelines for blue-winged teal hunting in
September call for canceling the season outright in 13 states and
for major reductions elsewhere.
   Last week, the service released population counts showing the
breeding populations of 10 major duck species down 3.7 percent from
1987 and 17 percent below the long-term 1955-1987 average. The
Northern pintail duck is at a record low of 2.58 million, 18
percent fewer than in 1987 and 54 percent below average.
   ``Biologists are beginning to worry that continued low water
conditions in the areas waterfowl use for migration stopovers and
wintering will concentrate the birds and make them more vulnerable
to disease later this year,'' the service said in a survey of
drought problems as seen by its biologists around the country.
   There are fewer statistics on non-duck species, but the service
reported the Platte River in Nebraska has been turned into a
``river of sand,'' exposing the nesting piping plover and the
interior least tern to threats of predators and death of aquatic
food species.
   Pheasant, quail and grouse may not be affected until next
spring, when they'll have less cover during nesting season.
   Some other highlights from the survey:
   _Geese are faring better than ducks, since they nest on more
permanent wetlands and are better able to protect their young from
predators.
   _Federal hatcheries in South Carolina and Georgia report rising
water temperatures are increasing mortality of young trout and on
Monday, North Carolina state hatcheries were reported rushing
600,000 fish to the state's cooler streams a month earlier than
usual.
   _Fish and Wildlife Service biologists on the Great Lakes report
flows on tributaries are so low they cannot safely apply chemicals
to control lamprey, which prey on lake trout, and that dredging
necessitated by low water will spread contaminated bottom sediment,
threatening other aquatic life.
   _Without significant rain soon, a near-total failure of the
acorn crop from oak trees in the Midwest and South will occur,
spelling problems for deer, squirrels and wild turkey dependent on
acorns for food.
   _All 750 seedlings of the green pitcher plant, an endangered
species planted by the service in Alabama this spring, have been
killed.
   The duck population surveys recorded increases and in some cases
record numbers of ducks in northern Canada and Alaska. This means
they couldn't find suitable wetland areas further south, and may
not have the energy left to breed at all after their longer flights.
   Frank Dunkle, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said
last week he expects increased emphasis on habitat management. He
said marshland managed specifically for waterfowl has provided the
only relief for ducks and other species dependent on prairie
wetlands.
