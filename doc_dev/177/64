   Walleye fishing is one of the fastest-growing outdoor sports,
and Bob Kaczkowski believes the toothy cousin of the perch may be
the most sought-after catch in the country in the 21st century.
   The walleye is a northern river fish which has been transplanted
as far south as Louisiana and to the west side of the Rockies.
   ``I predict in the next 10 years, almost nationwide, walleye
fishing is going to be it. All the way from New York to the state
of Washington, it's going bonkers,'' said Kaczkowski, who is an
avid walleye angler and executive director of the Franklin,
Wis.-based Manufacturers Walleye Council, which operates the
nation's major walleye tournament circuit.
   While walleye can be caught all year, even through the ice in
winter, spring is when the fishing really can get good.
   ``With spring walleye, often it's feast or famine,'' said
Kaczkowski. ``It sometimes seems like your fishing for nothing for
hours on end, then in 20 minutes two of you can have limits.
   ``They always school tight. Usually, if you find one, you're
going to find a ton of them. Spring fishing is very, very
rewarding.''
   There are two groups of walleyes _ those which spawn in rivers
and those confined to lakes.
   The walleye run begins in fall, as the fish move to staging
areas in the deepest holes they can find.
   The action begins when the water warms up to 45 degrees, and
since rivers warm up sooner than lakes, it begins there first. Then
the lake walleyes that head upriver to spawn make their move.
   In the lakes there are two types of walleyes _ those that spawn
in shallow water up against the bank and those that use offshore
points, humps or bars as spawning areas. The shoreline spawners get
active first.
   Spawning actually begins when females join the males in very
shallow water, usually between midnight and dawn, and the males
prod the females into dropping her eggs. Then they fertilize them.
   The best way to catch spawning walleye is with a lead-head jig
tipped with a minnow, Kaczkowski said.
   ``It's critical the fisherman match the current speed and depth
of water with the weight of the jig. You don't want to be jigging
and have the thing swept right down the stream because no
self-respecting walleye is going to chase it downriver after he's
just swum 10 miles upriver,'' he said. ``You want it heavy enough
so that when you lift if off the bottom it just eases downstream a
little bit.''
   Another method is the Wolf River rig, named after the famous
walleye river in Wisconsin. There are many local variations, but
it's basically a three-eye swivel with a sinker on light line
attached to one eye, a leader with a minnow attached to the second
and the angler's line tied to the third.
   It keeps the minnow swimming just off the bottom in the current.
   Kaczkowski said a third trick is the slip bobber with a minnow
hanging below. Allow the wind or current to carry the bobber, and
minnow, into snags or swampy areas where it's difficult to cast a
lure. You can adjust your bait to any depth below the bobber.
   Trolling lures, or nightcrawlers, also are popular, particularly
on big lakes, such as walleye-rich Lake Erie.
   In the spring, that means using small minnows because natural
wild minnows are small.
   ``Even big walleye _ I mean 10-pound walleye _ often prefer
those smaller minnows in the spring,'' Kaczkowski said. ``When I go
out in the spring walleye fishing, I always take two or three sizes
of minnows, because if you buy a couple dozen and they are all the
same size and the fish don't want them, then what?''
   While the overwhelming choice of bait in the spring is the
minnow, sometimes, ``when the fish are aggressive, half a
nightcrawler, a teaser, just enough to cover the hook portion of
the jig, also works,'' he said. ``Later, they'll go for small,
whole crawlers and leaches.''
   Artificial bait specialists should use small stickbaits, such as
Rapalas.
   ``When they're shallow, you can get them on a stickbait, or
anything with a tight wobble. Anything that has too much of a
wobble is not attractive to walleye,'' Kaczkowski said.
   The tournament circuit, he said, has debunked the idea that
walleye are only caught at night.
   ``I've had a lot of success between 9 a.m. and noon and during
the mid-afternoon hours,'' Kaczkowski said. ``On the Manufacturers
Walleye Council circuit we have found out, based on the experience
of 3,025 fishermen last year, most of our walleyes are caught
between 11 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon _ and the bigger
fish have come on very hot, bright days.
   ``Believe it or not, the largest fish caught on our circuit, a
12{ pounder, was caught at noon in 3{ feet of water on a midlake
hump.''
