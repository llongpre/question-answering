   About 5,000 people evacuated after a toxic
chemical leak tainted the Sandusky River were permitted to return
to their homes today after fumes dissipated, the mayor said.
   A water emergency remained in effect in this northwestern Ohio
city of 22,000 after an estimated 100,000 gallons of flammable
toluene spilled Wednesday from a ruptured Sun Co. pipeline south of
here.
   Reserve tanks which hold about 4 million gallons of water were
expected to last until late this afternoon, Mayor Fred Singer said.
   At least three people were treated for injuries after an
undetermined amount of the chemical flowed into the river, and as
many as 5,000 residents were evacuated Wednesday and Thursday
because of the fumes, officials said.
   Toluene can produce irritating or poisonous gases, according to
an emergency response guidebook published by the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
   City and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials assessed
the air quality during the night.
   ``We just returned with federal EPA people and have monitored
the situation, and we are satisfied that it will be safe for the
people to return to the evacuated areas,'' Singer said early this
morning.
   Gov. Richard Celeste on Thursday declared a state of emergency
for Sandusky County, which includes Fremont. The declaration makes
state assistance available.
   The toluene was detected Wednesday night from a Sun Co. pipeline
near Tiffin, about 20 miles upstream from Fremont.
   Bob Arnet, an environmental safety coordinator for the Tulsa,
Okla.-based Sun Pipe Line, said Thursday that authorities had
turned off the pipeline, but had not located the leak.
   The city stopped taking in water from the river before the spill
reached Fremont late Thursday, officials said. They estimated a
14-mile section of the river was contaminated.
   Under the water emergency, industries are prohibited from using
water, and residents are urged to conserve.
   Singer said city officials were considering having the National
Guard truck in water from Clyde, about 10 miles southeast of
Fremont.
   EPA officials said they believed much of the chemical would
dissipate by the time it reaches Lake Erie.
   Singer criticized Sun officials for not notifying Fremont
officials of the spill until Thursday, and said the city will seek
reimbursement from the company for expenses incurred.
   ``It's real interesting. No one contacted us until 5 p.m., and
the chemical is dangerous and highly combustible,'' Singer said.
``They acted very irresponsibly.''
   Sun spokesman Bud Davis, said the company would take ``liability
and responsibility for the leak'' and cleanup, which could cost as
much as $1 million and take three to four months.
   Two Fremont residents on Thursday filed a class-action lawsuit
in U.S. District Court in Toledo against the Sun Pipe Line Co.
   Joe Albrechta, an attorney for Lupe Avalos and Barry Halstead,
said no specific dollar amount was named in the suit, which seeks
compensation for lost wages, property damage and damages for
emotional stress created by the incident.
   The spill occurred in a swampy area in Seneca County, south of
Fremont, and then leaked into Sugar Creek, a tributary of the
Sandusky River, said Sonya Elam, a spokeswoman for the Ohio
Disaster Services Agency. The Sandusky River flows north into Lake
Erie.
   Two emergency workers were treated at Tiffin Mercy Hospital
after they fell through ice and into contaminated water, and a
volunteer firefighter was treated after inhaling the fumes. All
were subsequently released.
   Ohio EPA spokesman Allan Franks said at least 100 dead fish were
visible in the river. He said officials suspect there may be 1,000
dead fish under the ice.
