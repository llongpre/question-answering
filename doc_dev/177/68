the Alamo River enters the sea are experiencing some of the best flathead 
catfish fishing in years.

Jerry Netzley of Poor Richard's Bait and Tackle called it "the best bite I've 
seen," and said the fish are averaging better than 20 pounds. One of the 
biggest ones, however, was the 38-pounder caught by San Bernardino's Robert
