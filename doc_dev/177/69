<LEADPARA>  State parole authorities rejected the release Tuesday of J.C.X. Simon, one of
the "Zebra" killers who terrorized San Francisco in the 1970s, taking 14
lives.;    A three-member panel of the state Board of Prison Terms refused to
parole Simon for the sixth time. The panel said Simon participated "in one of
the most notorious crime sprees in the history of the city of San Francisco.
The entire city was terrorized" from October 1973 to April 1974.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The three-hour hearing included testimony from San Francisco Mayor Art
Agnos, who was wounded by one of the Zebra killers, and relatives of other
victims.;    The panel concluded that Simon, 45, had "demonstrated a wanton
disregard for the rights and lives of others." It ruled that he could not
apply for parole again for at least three years.;    The board noted that
Simon's psychiatric reports were unsatisfactory, that he has "a history of
assaultive behavior, (and) there is no indication he would behave differently
if paroled.";    The witnesses included Pete and Jeanne Shields, the parents
of one of the victims, who said their 23-year-old son, Nick, was murdered 17
years ago to the day.;    More than a dozen people, including family members
and victims, attended the hearing at the California Medical Facility in
Vacaville, a state prison about 50 miles east of San Francisco.;    Simon and
three others were members of a black cult called the "Death Angels" that
killed white victims at random in San Francisco.;    Prosecutors said the
"Death Angels" were an offshoot sect of the Black Muslims devoted to racial
hatred. Witnesses at the trial testified that "Death Angels" had to kill
whites to belong to the group. The defendants denied this.;    Agnos, then an
aide to a state lawmaker, was among seven people wounded by the band. He was
shot twice in the chest and lost his spleen.;    Simon is serving a life
sentence at Vacaville. The other Zebra killers -- Larry Green, Manuel Moore
and Jesse Lee Cooks -- are also serving life sentences for first-degree murder
and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. All were convicted in 1976.;   
"Fourteen years (in prison) for 14 murders does not fulfill the verdict of
life imprisonment imposed by society," Agnos said. "I believe that life
imprisonment in such circumstances should mean life imprisonment." Simon has
failed five times previously to win parole.;    Green, 39, is being held at
Vacaville, and has been turned down for parole six times. Moore and Cooks,
both 46, are in custody at the California Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo.  </TEXT>
