   The zebra mussel, a fast-breeding type of
shellfish that clogs the intake pipes of power plants, has been
found in the Hudson River for the first time, scientists said.
   The mussels, which had not been seen east of the central section
of the Erie Canal, were found off Croton Point in Westchester
County, New York City's northern suburbs. It was identified
Wednesday by experts at the New York Zebra Mussel Information
Clearinghouse at the State University of New York at Brockport.
   ``It is the first confirmed North American sighting of the
mussel outside of the Great Lakes drainage basin,'' Charles O'Neill
Jr., a supervisor at the clearinghouse, told The New York Times in
a story published today.
   O'Neill noted that the zebra mussel, classified as a freshwater
animal, is not usually found in saltwater like the lower Hudson.
   ``It raises a lot of questions that we don't have answers for,''
he said.
   The zebra mussel, a native of Europe, was first found in the
United States in 1988 in Lake St. Clair, east of Detroit.
   Named for its dark brown stripes on a tan shell, the mussel
breeds quickly and can clog the intake pipes of power plants and
eats microscopic plants at the base of the food chain for
freshwater fish.
   In areas where the mussels have taken hold, utilities have
fought back by flushing pipes with treated water, cleaning intake
screens by hand and using chlorine and other chemicals to kill
them.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated that the
expanding population of the mussels could add $500 million a year
in added costs for utilities, water companies and factories and
loss of business in sports fishing, marinas and motels along inland
waterways.
