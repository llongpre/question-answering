   The humble mussel, a tidal water
delicacy, is now playing a pivotal role in monitoring pollution in
the North Sea.
   Spread over 15 locations along the Dutch coast, 1,500 of the
jet-black mollusks were put into service this week as a way
scientists can check the flow of poisonous waste through the North
Sea, one of the most heavily polluted basins in the world, a project
spokesman said Friday.
   In filtering algae from sea water for food, the bivalves also
store poisonous waste and heavy metals. A look at what they have
stored gives a picture of the quality of water they live in.
   ``They give us a perfect overview of the water quality over the
time span involved,'' said Martin Scholten, a spokesman for the
government project.
   The mussels live in plastic baskets attached to shipping buoys up
to six miles off the coast. They will be checked in three six-week
periods over a year at a cost of $113,600.
   ``Mussels are ideal for this kind of job because they filter so
much water,'' Scholten said. The average mussel processes about 13
gallons of sea water a day, he said.
