FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Shopping without tears, a food

Three factors have led me to spend another lengthy period on the phone
talking to Britain's most individualistic suppliers and retailers.
The first was hearing from many readers how useful this guide has been not
just in the hectic run-up to Christmas but during the rest of the year.
Bulky boxes of food delivered to your door can save you time and backache.
In talking to these suppliers I also realised how widely last year's guide
was appreciated. One Lancashire supplier received a phone call and orders
from a reader in Canada while another, based in London, was soon packing
orders for Eire and Norway.
Finally, there is the growing conviction among suppliers that they have
weathered the worst - the recession and the costly imposition of new health
regulations - and they can now concentrate on producing first class
ingredients.
