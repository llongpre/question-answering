   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Freshwater mussels and clams are falling victim
to disease and greed, and experts ponder the fate of the rivers
that depend on them.

   Ecologist Richard Sparks has worked the
muddy bottoms of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers studying
freshwater clams and mussels _ nature's water filters _ and he
doesn't like what he sees.
   The shelled creatures are disappearing from their native North
American riverbeds, where they spend their lives filtering polluted
water through hairline openings in their shells. Scientists cite
two reasons.
   One is massive die-offs, as yet unexplained.
   The other is the voracious appetite of the Japanese cultured
pearl industry, which grinds tiny beads from mussel shells and
imbeds them in oysters to produce pearls. Over-zealous shellers are
staging a rush on U.S. mussel beds, further harming supplies.
   ``There used to be 50 species of mussels on the upper
Mississippi, and now there're only 36 to 38 left,'' says Sparks, a
river ecologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey at its
river research lab in Havana.
   Sparks is one of dozens of scientists and others in states
across the Midwest concerned about the plight of mussels and clams,
which come in all sizes and shapes and live as long as 50 years.
   ``I've been buying shells on the Mississippi River for 14
years,'' says D.E. ``Butch'' Ballenger, owner of the Mississippi
Valley Shell Co., in Muscatine, Iowa. ``I plan on doing this a long
time. That's why me and another buyer pushed for laws in Wisconsin
and Iowa to limit the season and shell size.''
   Ballenger, 49, employs about 130 harvesters. He exports his
shells to Japan and is working with environmentalists to get state
action to protect the mussels from over-harvest.
   He worries about the recent influx of shellers from rivers in
states such as Oklahoma, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.
   ``We're getting more and more shellers from out-of-state,''
Ballenger says. ``The mussel beds down south are exhausted, and
they're moving up here. States along the upper Mississippi
shouldn't sell out-of-state shelling licenses.''
   Shelling is a multimillion-dollar industry in the United States,
with shells alone selling for $300 to $1,000 per ton.
   In 1987, 1,128 tons were collected from Illinois and 1,016 tons
from Iowa. Wisconsin waters yielded 667 tons of shells in 1986, the
only full year for which figures were available.
   Freshwater clams and mussels are harvested by hand, using hooks
on poles or by dredging riverbeds.
   In Camden, Tenn., John Latendresse has branched out from simply
selling shells to Japan through his Tennessee Shell Co. Now, he's
growing pearls and producing jewelry _ the first American to crack
the Japanese-dominated industry.
   He says the cultured pearl industry accounts for 3,000 jobs in
Japan, and his dream is to bring as many of those as possible to
the United States. But the industry may be short-lived, Latendresse
says, unless state and federal lawmakers act to protect American
mussel beds.
   ``We exported $16 million worth of mussels to Japan in 1986,''
says Latendresse, citing industry research. ``Cultured pearls are a
$500 million a year industry over there. We're exhausting our
mussel beds to supply their industry. It's a big problem, and I'm
very concerned about it.''
   Even representatives of Japan's cultured pearl industry are
concerned about overharvest in the United States.
   ``It's a free-for-all out there,'' says Nori Sakata, president
of the Sakata Pearl Co. of Tokyo, referring to the competition
between shellers on American rivers. ``It's not just the
Mississippi River. It's the Ohio River and others. They definitely
need restrictions.
   ``The commercial harvesters are over-dredging the rivers. They
don't give the mussel beds a chance for any new growth to occur.
Everybody's trying to get in on it, and they're starting to dredge
smaller rivers. It doesn't do any good for the ecology.''
   Sakata runs the Chicago office of the company, which imports
jewelry and cultured pearls grown at the family oyster farm in
Japan. Founded in 1956, the company began its U.S. operation 25
years ago and had $3.5 million in sales last year.
   ``It think they might need to protect their resources better,''
Sakata says. ``The Persian Oriental Pearl industry is dead because
they didn't protect it. The Persian Gulf used to be a hotbed for
pearls.
   ``If people don't protect their resources, they're going to lose
them.''
