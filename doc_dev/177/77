<LEADPARA>  Pearl farmer Paul Cross scoffs at the conventional wisdom that says cultured
pearls grow only in the Orient.;    That view, he contends, is a myth fostered
by Japanese pearl farmers, who have dominated the multimillion-dollar industry
since cultured pearls were developed in the early 1900s.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "They've created a giant facade about it," said Cross, a former jewelry
designer and petroleum contractor. "It's not about divers risking their lives
out there every day, diving 50 feet and holding their breath, swimming among
sharks. It's really an assembly-line operation.";    To prove the point, Cross
has invested five years of research and about $1 million in Canadian venture
capital in a freshwater pearl farm amid a Northern California gold field.;   
If the experiment pays off, Cross says his floating crop of Mississippi
River-bred mussels could produce about $12 million a year in seed pearls and
pearl byproducts. That would be the biggest success in a fledgling American
industry limited so far to a few small-scale operations in the South.;    "I
don't see us being the biggest pearl grower in the world, but I do see us with
a good grip on the market," Cross said in a recent interview.;    How idea
grew;  Cross, 42, said he got the idea while working as an engineer in oil
fields in south Texas in the early 1980s. He saw rig hands dive on their free
time for river mussels to sell to overseas pearl farmers.;    Widely used to
make shirt buttons before the advent of plastic, the shells are cut and ground
into spherical beads that become the seeds of cultured pearls. And the shells
used mostly for the beads are American-grown.;    "Without these beads, you
don't get to make pearls. . . . Without the U.S. raw natural resource, the
Japanese would be out of business," said Cross, a wiry, talkative man who
idolizes Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca.;    Cross already had more than
a decade of experience in the jewelry business. In 1968, he started selling
his own creations from an ice cream truck in Hawaii. He parlayed that business
into a chain of wholesale, manufacturing and retail outlets.;    Watching the
shell divers inspired Cross to consult biologists and studies on mollusks and
pearls. In 1985, he and girlfriend Karen Ludeman set up a lab in Woodland
Hills to experiment in growing mussels and pearls.;    In June 1988, he
obtained financing from Pineridge Capital Corp., a venture capital firm in
Vancouver, British Columbia.;    First crop due soon;    Cross Pacific Pearls
Inc. started construction in January 1989 and pearl culturing six months later
on 30 acres leased from the Yuba Placer Gold Co. aggregate field near Beale
Air Force Base, about 45 miles north of Sacramento.;    Cross said he expects
to harvest his first crop in late spring or early summer.;    When Cross
Pacific Pearls sold 550,000 shares at $3.35 each on the Vancouver Stock
Exchange last spring, the prospectus described the stocks as "highly
speculative.";    However, biologists consulted by Cross said the operation is
on a sure footing.;    Clifton Coney, collection manager for mollusks at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, said bivalve mollusks such as
oysters, clams and mussels grow pearls like people grow fingernails. The lake
at Cross Pacific, fed by water that filters through gravel levees from the
Yuba River, is a "perfect environment" for pearl farming, Coney said.;    The
mussels arrive in refrigerated trucks from the Mississippi and Tennessee river
systems, then undergo a quick operation in which workers gently pry open the
shells so they can insert a plastic half-sphere to grow mabe pearls or implant
round shell beads into the mollusks' flesh for seed pearls.;    How pearls
form;  To soothe the irritation, the mussels coat the implants with layers of
calcium carbonate, or nacre. The results, after several months or even years,
are cultured pearls.;    Most of Cross Pacific's first crop will be mabe
pearls, which are easier and faster to grow. Mabe pearls are used in earrings,
cuff links and other jewelry.;    While marine oysters create pearls that are
white, off-white, and black, pearls from the freshwater mollusks also come in
pinks, blues and lavenders.;    But even if the farm never produces a
gem-quality pearl, Cross said his company should still thrive. He said he's
working with cosmetic companies to develop pearl-based skin scrubs and creams
popular in Europe.;    But the operation's backbone could be manufacturing
implant beads for other pearl farmers. Cross estimated that bead manufacturing
is an $85 million-a-year market.;    Cross developed his own machinery for
cutting and grinding shells into nearly perfect spheres, modifying a
commercial bread dough mixer for a bead polisher.;    Last July, Cross Pacific
announced a $3.8 million, nine-month contract with a Japanese company, Pearl
of the Orient Akashi Co. Inc., for more than 10,000 pounds of implant beads.  </TEXT>
