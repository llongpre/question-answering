<TEXT>     Increased sensitivity toward animal rights and the environment and the
ever-growing list of endangered species are prompting some to question certain
decorating styles -- from Southwest to hunting-lodge to out-of-Africa chic.;  
 Personally, I've been feeling guilty for three years about the mounted deer
head in my living room. Now, I'm not a hunter. In fact, the killing of wild
animals is not what I consider a sport. I bagged my trophy at an antique
shop.;    I just didn't think about the moral implications -- until I got it
home and on the wall. Then, instead of a trophy or an artifact, I saw a sad
perversion. And I began to recognize the part I had played -- albeit at arm's
length -- in fostering a market that ultimately supports animal killing for
pleasure.;    Suddenly, I was no longer morally superior to the guy who pulled
the trigger or the woman who wears a coat made from the hide of a coyote or a
baby seal that she didn't personally slaughter. And I began to realize that
for years I had been only too happy to admire home furnishings derived from
animals: bearskin rugs, fox throws and antler chandeliers. I'd never given
much thought to the fact that a bearskin rug was once a bear, a fox throw was
once a pack of foxes and that an antler chandelier was made from the crowns
worn by of who knows how many late stags.;    So, all right, lesson learned.
No more deer heads, no more antlers, no more polar-bear rugs. No more lusting
for the masculine rusticity of the hunting lodge, or the exotica of the safari
tent.;    But what about leather furniture, steer-hide rugs, suede pillows,
goose-down comforters, wool carpeting and that icon of Southwest style, the
bleached cow skull?;    Frankly, reconciling all the points of view on
animal-derived home decorating is beyond me. I'm not a purist, just a typical
middle-of-the-roader. But, if pressed, I suppose I'd have to say that I think
it's all right to use materials from domesticated, agricultural animals for
home furnishings and decorative accessories -- as long as they are a byproduct
of food production.;    One way to sidestep the issue is to purchase man-made
look-alikes. Lighting manufacturers offer synthetic stag-horn fixtures. Rug
makers duplicate the look of zebra, tiger, leopard and other wild animal hides
by printing on steer hides or synthetic fibers. Animal-print fabrics are
widely available.;    Yet another compromise is to approximate the look of
exotic animal materials yourself. That's what Michael Lane, a contributing
editor to Decorating &amp; Remodeling magazine, did. A wildlife conservationist at
heart, he painted a faux tortoise-shell mirror frame with black and
burnt-sienna acrylic paint over a base of yellow ocher. For a leopard chair
cushion, he dabbed fabric paint on cotton velvet. And on a coarse sisal rug he
used black acrylic paint to create a zebra's stripes.;    "There's really no
reason these days to use real wild animals, endangered or not, for decorating
because there are so many alternatives," Lane says. "Besides, there is an
element of fantasy, whimsy and hand-craftsmanship in approximating the look.
In that way, it becomes better than the real thing.";    Still, as a design
consultant, Lane sometimes finds himself torn between personal convictions and
professional obligations.;    "I pretty much try to avoid natural animal
materials across the board," he says. "But, if it's something a client already
has and is particularly drawn to, it's pretty hard to pull them away from
it.";    Instead of proselytizing, Lane teaches by example.;    "I liken it to
the time I stopped drinking, about five years ago," he says. "I didn't do much
talking about that either. But people noticed, and I think I passively
influenced the way they looked at their own drinking habits. The same thing
applies to my design projects. "I just don't use real animal elements, and, in
the long run, I think that's a lot more effective than preaching.";    In the
end, like Lane, each of us will have to decide what is essential to the
comfort and enjoyment of our homes and what our values are regarding all
creatures great and small.  </TEXT>
