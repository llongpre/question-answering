</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catfish are biting at most Southland reservoirs and fishermen at Ventura 
County's Lake Casitas and Los Angeles County's Pyramid Lake appear to be doing 
best. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Tieso of Carpinteria caught a 21-pound catfish at Casitas and Rick 
Sandford and Mark Ruben of West Covina teamed to catch seven catfish totaling 
33 pounds at Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
WILLOW BEACH -- River level low and trout bite generally slow, with most fish 
taken up river. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Striped bass biting throughout lake, with bigger fish coming from 
Overton Arm and Vegas Wash. Anchovies best bet. Largemouth bass biting to 20 
feet in coves and near dropoffs. Waterdogs best bet. Catfish picking up, biting 
on anchovies and nightcrawlers. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass bite good in river, with most fish between one 
and three pounds. David Cherry, Bullhead City, 16-pound striper. Catfish 
between three and five pounds biting in river and lake. Other species slow. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina bite good, with live bait working best. Fish 
in the 10-pound class common. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Largemouth bass taking dark plastic worms, biting to 20 feet in 
coves and near dropoffs. Trout biting throughout lake. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Largemouth bass biting along east shoreline and Sunken Island 
at 15-25 feet, most baits working. Mike Novac, Camarillo, 12-pound bass. 
Catfish biting at 20 feet. Mackerel best bet. Trout biting best on Power Bait 
at Wadleigh Arm. Greg Moter, 3 1/4-pound trout.

PYRAMID LAKE -- Catfish bite very good, with dam best bet. Largemouth and 
smallmouth bass bites strong. Several limits. Striped bass bite slow despite

trolling and stillfishing. Little Virginia Lake is open and fishable for

uniform during the intervals. Ken Ross, San Diego, 3 3/4-pound rainbow on Gull 
Lake on trout-colored rapala. Jerry Meeks, Burbank, 4-9 rainbow shorefishing in 
June Lake with Power Bait.

<P>
MAMMOTH -- Cooling trend this weekend, with possible rain. Hot Creek has been 
tough, with lots of fishing pressure. Nymphs best, with an indicator and enough 
weight to sink to the bottom. The Owens at Benton Crossing is very slow, but 
the Owens River at Big Springs has good action for rainbows 12-20 inches, using 
nymphs for catching or dry flies for excitement. The Twin Lakes at Mammoth have 
had action in the evening, trolling and casting flies from float tubes. 
Shorefishing slow. At Crowley Lake, trout not interested in flies. Boats with 
scopes indicate fish on the bottom feeding on fly hatches. Lures good for 
limits at Convict Lake, rainbows 2-3 pounds.

BISHOP -- Big browns and rainbows coming from Big Pine Creek, using worms and 
mini-micro marshmallows. Catches in the river 3-4 pounds with baby 
nightcrawlers and crickets. Many limits. Pleasant Valley Reservoir turned a 17
