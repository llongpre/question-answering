FISH REPORT: YELLOWTAIL ARE HITTING SOUTH OF SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yellowtail have made a strong showing at the Coronado Islands south of San 
Diego and, according to Carol Stock, a reservations clerk at Fisherman's 
Landing, they're right on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, anglers aboard nine boats brought in 375 yellowtail, all in the 12- 
to 15-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the bite showed no signs of slowing. The Conquest, with 18 anglers 
aboard, reported that 82 of the popular jacks had already been landed, and the 
Prowler, with 45 fishermen aboard, reported catching 85 yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, barracuda are cooperating in large numbers with fishermen at many 
areas along the coast, a further indication that this could be a successful 
summer.
