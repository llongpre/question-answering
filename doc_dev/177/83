   The Maumee River is hardly flowing these
days in this town whose name conjures images of waterfalls and
flowing streams.
   ``It is amazing,'' said Walter Jones, 53, who has lived near
this village in northwest Ohio most of his life. ``I do not think I
have ever seen the river this dry. We have had some droughts, but
nothing like this.''
   The Maumee has been the lifeblood for many communities along its
banks. But this summer, levels in some stretches of the
drought-stricken river have dropped so low that communities have
implemented mandatory water use restrictions.
   Few villages have suffered as much as Waterville. The Ohio
Department of Natural Resources says the Maumee at Waterville is
flowing at 12 percent of its normal rate. Water use has been
restricted since Memorial Day.
   Two weeks ago, Waterville officials asked Grand Rapids, about 10
miles to the south, to open an old canal to release more water into
the Maumee.
   The state rejected the plan, saying the situation was not that
critical.
   However, Donald Holycross, Waterville's village administrator,
said Monday that the flow of water on the Maumee has increased _
though not enough _ over the last week.
   ``I still cannot tell you why,'' he said. ``I do not know
whether it was because of rainfall along the river.''
   The 80-mile-long Maumee originates in Fort Wayne, Ind., snakes
through several northwest Ohio counties and empties into Maumee Bay
on Lake Erie.
   Toledo, Ohio's fourth-largest city and on the banks of the
Maumee, hasn't suffered from the water shortage, since it draws all
its water from Lake Erie.
   The drought has affected other streams in rural northwest Ohio.
   The 120-mile-long Sandusky River, another Lake Erie tributary,
has more than its share of dry spots, and thousands of fish have
been killed near the Ballville Dam, Fremont's main reservoir, said
Rod Lash, the city's safety-service director.
   In Fremont, about 30 miles southeast of Toledo, officials have
reached an agreement with the Ohio Division of Water to release 10
million gallons daily for five days from a reservoir near Marion.
After that, the state will provide 5 million gallons a day from the
reservoir for as long as needed.
   Lash said it will take a week to 10 days for the water to make
the 100-mile trip north to Fremont.
   In Fostoria, which draws its water from the 50-mile-long Portage
River, voluntary water restrictions are in place. But that could
change, said J. Charles Macias, the city's safety-service director.
   The city's reservoirs, he said, have enough water to last for
several months, but is afraid the reserves could be depleted
quickly if the drought continues.
   Macias said scattered showers that fell over the region on
Sunday and Monday did little to alleviate the problem.
   ``We only got about four-tenths of an inch, not enough to pick
up any water at all. We would need two weeks of that kind of rain
to have the normal water flow in the river,'' he said.
