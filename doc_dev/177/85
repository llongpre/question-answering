<LEADPARA>  On the ocean floor, the menacing torpedo-shaped shark glided forward, fierce
jaws opened wide and long tail propelling its strong body closer to . . . a
rock to hide under.;    What? Hide? What kind of shark is this?  </LEADPARA>

MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM EXHIBIT INSTEAD SHOWS
DANGERS OF MAN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A quite average kind, actually, one of the more than 355 varieties of
sharks that pose no threat to humans, and one of 15 that make up the Monterey
Bay Aquarium's newest exhibit, a display devoted to the proposition that a
shark-eating man is far more dangerous than a man-eating shark.;    The
exhibit, which opens Sunday and runs through October, is filled with an
assortment of amazing facts and nifty creatures, like the electro-sensors on
shark snouts that scientists believe allow them to use the Earth's magnetic
field to travel around the globe.;    The exhibit is also filled with
not-so-neat facts about how man treats sharks -- cutting the fins off live
sharks for soup before throwing the mutilated animals back in the water to
die, and fishing them to near extinction.;    "When you say shark to most
people, this image comes into people's minds of something white and scary and
unpleasant," said Dave Powell, a shark expert at the aquarium. "In this
exhibit you find out that they are not really frightening. They are fairly
meek, benign creatures, many of them, and they are very beautiful.";    The
exhibit is a first for the aquarium. Researchers went all the way to Australia
and Hong Kong to collect the predators. It is also made up of startling
displays -- like the live shark embryos in various stages of development
suspended in individual tanks and backlit so viewers can see unborn sharks
breathing inside.;    Also included in the 6,000 square foot exhibit are
sharks that normally coast a cool 7,000 feet below sea level, sharks with
wide, flat heads like Chinese fans, and a shark covered in zebra stripes.;   
Many of the sharks on display are still babies -- because when they reach
maturity 10 years from now, they will for the most part be too unwieldy to
keep in captivity. But viewers are warned not to touch the fish gliding
smoothly about in open tanks, because these babies will whip around in a split
second and bite.;    That is just the point, aquarium researchers are at pains
to say. Sharks, they tell us, need compassion. Like a playground bully, they
say, sharks are better just left alone.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTEDThe aquarium, at
886 Cannery Row in Monterey, is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. The exhibit
continues through October. For information call (408) 648-4888.  </TEXT>
