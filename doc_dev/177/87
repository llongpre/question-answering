   Reba Goins has never played basketball,
much less shot a free throw in front of television cameras and a
crowd of thousands, but she'll have $50,000 at stake when she steps
to the line at the Los Angeles Forum this week.
   The winner of a drawing sponsored by a snack-food maker, Mrs.
Goins, 57, will receive $10,000 for each of five free throw attempts
she makes during halftime at Game 4 of the Lakers-Pistons NBA
Championship playoff game Tuesday night.
   Even if Mrs. Goins misses all five free throws, she will still
take home $10,000.
   Hoping for the best, she is undergoing a crash course in
free-throw shooting under the watchful eye of her son-in-law at a
local elementary school gymnasium.
   Mrs. Goins said she shot about 50 free throws Thursday.
   How many did she make?
   ``Oh, two or three,'' she said.
   Still, she's been lucky so far, as evidenced by the fact that she
made the contest at all.
   ``I was just doing my shopping and saw an entry form and filled
it out,'' Mrs. Goins said. ``Then, last Saturday, I received a
letter by Federal Express telling me I had won. They (contest
sponsors) called Monday to see if I was going and I told them `yes'
in a hurry.''

   When Edward Green retired after 38 years of
looking after animals at the Audubon Zoo, his co-workers chipped in
for a farewell present _ a trip to Africa.
   ``It seemed to us that for someone who had worked with African
animals for 20 years, it would be really a neat thing if he could go
over there and see them in the wild,'' General Curator David
Anderson said. ``Especially for someone who had taught us as much as
he had.''
   During his trip this month, Green hopes to see elephants,
giraffes, rhinoceroses and gazelles _ many of whose cousins he
helped care for.
   Green, 63, had little schooling and no formal training in caring
for animals, except for growing up on a farm in his native
Woodville, Miss. What he knows about zebras and hippopotamuses, he
picked up on the job.
   His first zoo job _ for 36 cents an hour _ was cutting the grass.
After he became a zookeeper, he was assigned first to the monkeys,
then lions, birds and sea lions before spending 20 years working
with the hoofed animals.
   When he started, the animals were housed in small pens or cages;
now, most roam fields approximating natural habitats.
   On a recent tour, he described the hippopotamus: a mean creature,
who, despite her bulk and sluggish appearance, can leap suddenly out
of her pool. A keeper must be constantly alert, Green said.
   The giraffes were among his favorites. ``I never had no trouble
with them.''
   His least favorites? Grevy's zebras. And buffaloes. And
``Tommys,'' or Thomson's gazelles, small, deerlike creatures that he
called real mean.
   As a self-made expert, Green is skeptical of young zookeepers who
he says think a college degree is a substitute for actual
experience. And Anderson agrees.
   ``Ed taught me more about animals than anybody ever had,'' said
Anderson. ``We've had three assistant curators ... since then, and
he's helped teach every one of them something about animals _ and
about people, too.''
   Green was injured once _ an ostrich knocked him down _ because,
he said, he didn't have his mind on the job.
   ``But I knew what to do,'' Green said. ``I rolled over and over
to keep under him so he couldn't see me.''
