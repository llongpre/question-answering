   A landslide-damaged petroleum pipeline sent
an 8-mile-long slick down the Allegheny River on Saturday,
threatening water supplies for more than 100,000 people,
authorities said.
   Fumes from the spill forced the evacuation of 100 people.
   Heavy rain Friday apparently caused the landslide that cracked
the pipeline the same day, said Ray Haase Jr. of Buckeye Pipeline
Co.
   About 75,000 gallons of a 50-50 mixture of diesel and heating
oil leaked into Knapp Run Creek, then flowed into the Allegheny
about five miles north of Freeport, said Haase. The creek joins the
Allegheny about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh.
   Monitors at Buckeye Pipeline's Allentown headquarters detected
the leak around 11 p.m. Friday when they noticed a loss of pressure
in the 10-inch-wide pipe, which runs from Linden, N.J., to the
Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis, Haase said.
   They cut off the flow of fuel about 20 minutes later. It was
unknown what time the leak began, Haase said.
   ``There may have been delays,'' he told an afternoon news
conference. ``It's not always an instantaneous decision to shut a
valve when the pressure drops.''
   Water intakes in Freeport were closed and residents were advised
not to drink tap water, said state Department of Environmental
Resources spokeswoman Betsy Mallison. Three tanker trucks brought
potable water to the city of 3,000 people Saturday night.
   Water intake valves also were closed in South Buffalo Township,
Harrison Township, Brackenridge, New Kensington, Tarentum and
Oakmont. The 101,360 customers in those communities were being
advised to conserve water, Ms. Mallison said.
   ``I wouldn't do my laundry today,'' she said.
   A few miles southwest of Oakmont, the Pittsburgh Water
Department planned to close its intakes early Sunday and rely on
reserves for water for its 500,000 customers, said spokeswoman
Donna Sagmeister.
   She said the intakes could be reopened as early as Sunday night,
and said no conservation order would be issued.
   ``It's not as serious as it could have been,'' she said,
explaining that the fuel would have to pass over three locks and
dams before reaching the city treatment plant. ``That mixes it up.''
   Thirty people from two cleanup companies hired by Buckeye began
cleaning up the spill at 4 a.m. Saturday, state police said. They
set up booms along the Allegheny, where an oily film covered the
shore at Freeport on Saturday night.
   Crews on docks in the city used absorbent pads to collect fuel,
but workers at the creek were hindered by mud from the landslide,
Haase said.
   ``It's a nightmare up there,'' he said. ``There's about 200
yards of road gone. The landslide area is so unstable and saturated
with oil, it's not physically possible for anyone to get in there.''
   Fumes from the pads during the afternoon forced the evacuation
of about 100 residents of a riverside apartment building for the
elderly in Freeport to a nearby elementary school, Mayor Bob
Ravotti said.
   At a news conference, state Fish Commission officer Jerry
Greiner displayed minnows and crayfish killed in the creek, a
popular fishing spot. Conservation officers were counting dead fish
and trying to determine if birds were affected, Greiner said.
