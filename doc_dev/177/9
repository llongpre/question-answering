   NEW YORK -- A subsidiary of Coltec Industries Inc. says it
has a better way to combat the zebra mussel, the
fast-breeding mollusk pest that is clogging up America's
water pipes.
   Garlick Valves &amp; Industrial Plastics, a Camden, N.J., unit
of New York-based Coltec, said it has produced a plastic pipe
material in which a mollusk-killing chemical is embedded. The
chemically treated pipe keeps the mussels out of their
favorite breeding places -- water intake pipes, valves and
debris gates -- where they create problems for water
authorities and power generation plants.

   Utility officials pointed out that many companies have
been touting products and services with varying degrees of
effectiveness against the persistent pest.
   The zebra mussel, native to Europe, was discovered in the
Great Lakes in the 1980s; biologists believe they arrived in
the ballast of European freighters that moved in the lakes.
The mussel grows to about thumbnail-size, and breeds
profusely, up to concentrations of nearly a million per
square meter of surface. It causes havoc by clogging water
intake pipes of boats, factories, public water facilities and
irrigation systems. Various estimates of the cost of cleanup
and control of the zebra mussel over the next several years
run in the billions of dollars.
   Adam Patarcity, operations manager for Garlick Valves,
said the product, called Z-Gard, is a version of its
ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene to which a
molluscicide is added. The current slick-surfaced
polyethylene hasn't prevented the zebra mussels from
attaching, but the new plastic has been very effective, after
tests at 11 sites in Great Lakes, he said.
   The worst areas of infestation in the U.S. are Lake Erie,
particularly the southern shore around Cleveland, and Lake
Huron and the Detroit area. Removal of the mussels currently
must be done mechanically, by scraping or blasting with
high-pressure water, or by chemical treatment of the water.
Mr. Patarcity said that unlike previous efforts to control
the mussels, the chemical in its new pipe material won't
leach out into the water and threaten the environment.
   Z-Gard joins a growing list of ostensible mussel-stoppers,
and its potential market has a wait-and-see attitude. "Every
day we have people calling to offer a silver bullet" for the
problem, said William Kovalak, a biologist for Detroit Edison
Co. "So we take more of a passive stance. We let them come in
and put their product in the water, and if it works, we can
use it without having invested much." He said some
silicone-based chemical coatings for intake areas seem to
work well, adding that Detroit Edison facilities on lakes
Erie and Huron have some of the worst mussel concentrations
in the U.S.
