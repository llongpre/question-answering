   Emergency crews packed up their gear and city water officials in
West Virginia and Ohio breathed easier Thursday as a fuel spill in
the Ohio River dissipated to nearly undetectable levels.
   ``It's evaporating and emulsifying to the point where we're not
actively monitoring it anymore,'' said Jeanne Ison, a spokeswoman
for the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission. ``Our crews
are on their way home.''
   The diluted spill is all that remains of at least 75,000 gallons
of diesel oil, gasoline and kerosene that spilled into a tributary
of the Allegheny River above Pittsburgh last Friday, forcing
western Pennsylvania cities to close water intakes.
   The Allegheny and Monongahela rivers meet in Pittsburgh to form
the Ohio River.
   Officials in Toronto, Ohio, and Weirton, W.Va., near the
Pennsylvania border said they planned to keep river water intakes
closed until Friday afternoon. Both towns shut down their water
filtration plants Wednesday in anticipation of the spill.
   ``We're running on wells, 100 percent now,'' said Larry Coxen,
foreman at the Weirton water treatment plant. ``We don't want to
take any chances. We're meeting all our demands and we'll probably
go with the wells another day just to make sure.''
   Across the river in Steubenville, Ohio, officials mixed
activated carbon and chemicals with river water to remove any
remaining petroleum.
   ``So far, we haven't picked up anything that's noticeable, even
before the water is treated,'' said John West, an operator at the
Steubenville plant. ``We're operating normally. There's not a whole
lot of concern here ...''
   Twenty-five miles upstream, at East Liverpool, Ohio, two water
intakes near the river's surface remained closed to avoid floating
or suspended oil. A deeper intake remained open to draw water for
the town of 7,000.
   Officials at Wheeling, W.Va., about 25 miles downstream from
Weirton, canceled an emergency planning meeting that had been
scheduled for Thursday.
   ``To be honest, I haven't even talked to anybody about the spill
in two days, that's how concerned we are,'' said Conrad Slanina,
Wheeling's acting public works director. ``We don't anticipate any
problems at all.''
   ``It's gotten to the point where we can just have water plants
check it for us,'' said Chris Norman, an environmental engineer at
the Cincinnati-based Ohio River sanitation commission, which
oversees pollution control on the river.
   ``The organic matter in the water has dissipated so much that
it's easily treatable, but it does still need to be treated,''
Norman said. ``There should be no worry about drinking water and
little concern about the spill's effect on wildlife.''
   Pennsylvania officials on Thursday were assessing the damage to
fish, insects and wildlife.
   Thomas J. Qualters of the State Fish Commission said authorities
recovered about a dozen dead fish along the spill's path. He said
more fish could have been killed but have not yet floated to the
surface.
   The impact could be much more serious if the spill interfered
with spawning, which occurs at this time of year for various
species, said Qualters.
   Most Pennsylvania towns affected by the spill have returned to
normal.
   Water conservation measures remained in effect in six
Pennsylvania communities and residents of Harrison County, the only
area where taps went dry, were still being advised to boil water as
a precaution.
   Guillermo Cole, a spokesman for the Allegheny County (Pa.) Water
Department, said tests conducted Wednesday indicated the water is
nearly back to normal. But health officials were concerned about
globs of oil that could get into some intakes.
