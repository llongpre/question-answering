   Despite regulatory vigilance and significant
government cleanup efforts that brought the Great Lakes back from
an environmental crisis in the 1970s, the lakes may still pose a
health threat, U.S. and Canadian experts say.
   Accumulations of toxic contaminants are poisoning wildlife and
may reach up the food chain to the 35 million people who live in
the region, according to a report, ``Great Lakes, Great Legacy?,''
released Wednesday at news conferences held simultaneously in
Chicago and Toronto.
   ``Our study concludes that the Great Lakes environment is sick,
and it's no longer getting better,'' said David Runnalls, an
associate director at the Institute for Research on Public Policy
in Ottawa, Canada, which co-authored the study.
   The report said the Great Lakes cleanup that began in the early
1970s has reduced the amount of human waste and toxic industrial
garbage dumped into the lakes, but has not prevented continued
buildups of some dangerous chemicals, including cancer-causing
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, as well as pesticides that
leach into the lakes.
   ``Millions of people in the Great Lakes (region) are exposed to
the hazardous chemicals, drink them in the contaminated water, eat
them concentrated in the flesh of the fish and breathe them in the
air,'' said Jeff Leonard, vice president of The Conservation
Foundation of Washington, D.C., a nonprofit group that produced the
report with the IRPP.
   ``We know that these continuous exposures have serious adverse
effects on the wildlife of the Great Lakes region,'' Leonard said
from Toronto.
   ``We fear increasingly that humans, especially pregnant women
and children, may be affected as well.''
   Leonard said researchers do not know for certain what the risk
is to people from the toxic contamination in the Great Lakes, but
the report recommends that state health departments need to
reexamine and strengthen warnings about fish consumption.
   William K. Reilly, administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, praised the report at the Chicago news
conference, but said his agency was not prepared to say that
states' recommendations on fish consumption are out-of-date or
inappropriate.
   State officials in the Great Lakes region provide advice on fish
consumption based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards
for commercial fish. They are based on findings that certain types
of fish, particularly bigger and older ones, are more likely to
contain dangerous contaminants than others.
   The four states along Lake Michigan have advised that women and
children should not eat medium-sized fish and that no one should
eat very large fish from the lake.
   Reilly said the report shows that ``as a society we are not
moving fast enough'' to deal with pollution problems in the Great
Lakes.
   But he disagreed with report authors who said the United States
has not done enough to meet its obligations under the Great Lakes
Water Quality Agreement that it signed with Canada in 1978.
   The goal of zero discharge of toxic substances, set for the
Great Lakes in the 1978 agreement and as yet unmet, is one of seven
``principles for action'' outlined in the report.
   Others include increased monitoring and research to correct
``grossly inadequate'' feedback on the environmental quality of the
region, and an emphasis on prevention of pollution ahead of cleanup.
   The Great Lakes _ Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario and Superior _
border eight states and Canada, and hold 20 percent of the world's
fresh surface water.
