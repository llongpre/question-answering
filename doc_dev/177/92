FISH REPORT: AT LAKE HAVASU, ANGLERS MAKE BIG RUN ON STRIPED BASS WITH NEW LURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anglers looking for action with striped bass have found it at Lake Havasu the 
past few days. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean a lot of it through the whole lake," operator Bob Lee reported. 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Sam Perry of Corona caught and released more than 60 stripers in a 
four-hour frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest lure is one of the new Wiglstiks. 
</P>
<P>
WILLOW BEACH -- Fishing good from shore, with anchovies. Vern Wade had an 
18-pound striper near hatchery, offshore, and Craig Honey a 24-pounder by 
hatchery on an anchovy. Marvin Height of Las Vegas, took a 19 1/2-pound striper 
trolling downriver with a Long A Bomber. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Most activity from striped bass on anchovies, 25 to 50 feet deep, 
with a few topwater boils in Vegas Wash and in Overton Arm at Stewart's Point. 
A few catfish are in coves at night but running under 2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE HAVASU -- Lots of topwater action with stripers. Still generally small but 
individual catches reported from 3-10 pounds. "Wiglstik" lures successful, 
along with surface and sub-surface lures and chuggers. Catfish and largemouth 
slow, probably because water relatively cool. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass continuing strong. John Bonner of Bullhead City, 
Ariz., caught 27-pounder in Ft. Mojave area, using an anchovy. Lots of nice 
trout from casinos to Laughlin Bridge. Powerbait best. Catfish running at 3 
pounds in good numbers, using waterdogs up on the lake. Tuesday's temperature 
was 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Catch improving on croakers, using frozen anchovies. Catfish 
slow. One corvina weighed 14 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Trout good, trolling needlefish to seven colors down center at 
west end. Largemouth bass slow. Catfish good on mackerel in shallow areas. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Catfish and trout very good. Lots of catfish limits taken on 
mackerel in 3 to 5 feet along weed line. George Collier, Oxnard, had 10-fish 
limit totaling 60 pounds, the largest 18. Trolling with needlefish by dam in 
50-60 feet producing lots of trout. Largemouth bass first thing in morning 
only, although some seen on surface. Perch and crappie very slow. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Catfish still good, averaging about 7 pounds on mackerel, 10-35 
feet deep. Largemouth bass have turned erratic with the weather. Easy to get 
but small -- 1-3 pounds. No large stripers. Trout planted at both ends of lake 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- All fishing slow, despite catch of a 9-pound catfish. Trout and 
largemouth bass all small, with only a few limits. Night crawlers working best. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE ISABELLA -- Nightfishing from shore good for catfish, with clams, mackerel 
and night crawlers. Some largemouth bass from boats and float tubes. 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO LAKES -- Been slow and getting slower. For example, 359 anglers 
checked at Otay had 54 bass, 24 sunfish, 2 crappie and 70 channel cats. Bob 
Ulery of La Mesa caught catfish weighing 18-4 and 15-12 at San Vicente. Launch 
ramp at Miramar closed. Water also dropping at Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Renee Attaway of Fountain Valley caught a 39-pound catfish at 
night, using a mackerel. Crappie excellent at night, with bullet jigs and 
yellow chartreuse. Best from boats, but also good from shore and around boat 
docks, at Sierra Cove and red clay cliffs. A few bass on plastics at Rocky 
Point and west shore. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SKINNER -- Good for catfish, with mackerel and night crawlers. Some 
bluegill and crappie. Bass are 30 feet down for experienced anglers. 
Traditional baits are getting some trout from 60 feet down by dam. 
</P>
<P>
BIG BEAR LAKE -- Some thunderstorms and rain this week, but fishing good. Trout 
being taken from shore from Windy Point west to dam, using Powerbait. Trollers 
doing well with flashers, crawlers and needlefish, collecting catches 12-14 
inches. Catfish running 3-5 pounds on chicken livers and mackerel. Largemouth 
bass good only in early morning and late afternoon on plastic worms, grubs and 
spinner baits, at east end around weed beds and bays on south side. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SILVERWOOD -- Many nice stripers, topped by Greg Silks of Alta Loma, 22 
pounds, on a Bomber; Steve Mahoney of Barstow, 25, on Bomber 17-J, and Warren 
Dalfosse of Santa Monica, 20, on Stalker lure, all in channel. Many 13-17s. One
