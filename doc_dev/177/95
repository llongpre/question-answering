   Candidates for governor shalt not take the
Lord's name in vain on live television. Or they'll answer to their
mothers.
   ``Jesus Christ!'' blurted out former state Attorney General Cary
Edwards, frustrated at repeated interruptions from state Sen.
Gerald Cardinale during a debate for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination.
   That night, Edwards' mother called to chide him about the
outburst.
   ``Mom, if you had to sit up there with those guys, you'd invoke
the Lord's name, too,'' Edwards said he told her.
   Edwards' fellow candidates also have had their embarrassing
moments and comic interludes.
   U.S. Rep. James Courter told viewers of a GOP debate two weeks
ago of his ``seven- or nine-point plan'' to combat drugs. Within a
minute, he upped the ante to an 11-point program, leaving advisers
shaking their heads.
   Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick, briefly turned the verbal
warfare into a physical contest when he seized Courter's wrist,
preventing the obviously startled congressman from gesturing.
   Cardinale, a dentist, tried to show he's a man of his stripe in
illustrating his opposition to abortion.
   ``I believe as a scientist that this thing we call a fetus has
the same genes and chromosomes as you and I have,'' he said. ``What
distinquishes you and me from a zebra is those genes and
chromosomes, and you will never be a zebra as long as you have
those genes and chromosomes, and neither will I.''
   Perhaps the most humbling exchange came off-camera when state
Sen. William Gormley asked his 12-year-old son if he planned to
watch one of the debates.
   ``But Dad,'' pleaded the younger Gormley. ``It's up against
`Unsolved Mysteries.'''
   The candidates have fired carefully crafted one-liners aimed at
grabbing air time and scoring hits on one another.
   Hardwick called Edwards a ``General Custer'' in the losing war
on drugs.
   Edwards called Hardwick a legislative ``Santa Claus'' who makes
politically profitable promises to everyone but fails to say how he
will pay for them.
   ``Any chicken can pass a bill without a funding source,''
Gormley chimed in.
   Courter said state lawmakers have created the auto insurance
crisis, so asking them to fix it is like someone with a stiff neck
asking the Boston Strangler for a massage.
   The rollicking Republican exchanges have grown so heated that
the raucous debate continued into commercial breaks during a taping
last week.
   ``And you thought Republicans were boring,'' Gormley said.
   The televised Democratic exchanges have been much tamer, but
frequently featured Assemblyman Alan Karcher and Princeton Mayor
Barbara Sigmund ganging up on front-runner James Florio.
   Viewers may still be scratching their heads over U.S. Rep.
Florio's answer when asked whether he would agree to a third
televised debate.
   ``Well, I will make a determination as to what it is that I'm
going to be able to do at any particular time to be able to
communicate my message out there. That leaves a situation wherein
you have the opportunity to go talk to people, and if you have that
opportunity, you should take it,'' said Florio, who has been
accused by his two opponents of dodging them on the campaign trail.
   He said he would look forward to future forums, but added: ``I
will give you an answer at the appropriate time as to was it is
we're doing at the time we're conducting the debate.''
   His campaign the next day offered this translation: I don't know.
   Florio later agreed to two more debates.
   The Democrats also have grabbed their share of catchy sound
bites.
   Karcher charged Florio: ``You are the boss in south Jersey and I
think any one who would not believe that would have also to believe
in the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny.''
   Florio, asked to promise to refrain from negative campaigning,
said: ``I don't start street fights, but I don't walk away from
them.''
   Sigmund, who contributed numerous flippant comments, said of
President Reagan's professed love of local governments while he cut
state aid:
   ``I've heard about love from sweet-talking men for a long time,
and I'd rather have the money.''
