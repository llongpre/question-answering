<P>
America is blessed with ample water -- on an average day 4,200 billion gallons 
of rain fall on the lower 48 states. Most of that evaporates, leaving only 
about 1,435 billion gallons a day, of which in 1985, only about 340 billion 
gallons a day are withdrawn for human use. 
</P>
<P>
It seems like more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
However, as anyone who has ever flown across the nation (and looked out the 
window) can attest, the water is not spread evenly. Vast sections of the West 
are arid, though not necessarily unpopulated. 
</P>
<P>
Total water use exceeds average stream flow in 24 of 53 Western water-resource 
regions, a difference made up by "mining" dwindling ground water stocks and 
importing water. Much of the Colorado's flow, for example, is dammed, diverted 
and consumed upstream by irrigation and by the millions upon millions of people 
living (and insisting on green lawns) where it would otherwise be too dry. 
</P>
<P>
And matters may get much worse. After studying the temperature and stream-flow 
records, scientists have concluded that if a "conservative" 2-degree Celsius 
increase in temperature occurs, the virgin flow of the Colorado could fall by 
nearly a third. 
</P>
<P>
If, as some of the computer models suggest, this is accompanied by a 10% fall 
in precipitation in the Southwest as a result of new weather patterns, water 
supply in the upper Colorado could fall by 40%, but even if precipitation went 
up 10%, runoff would still drop nearly a fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Across the West, the picture is similar -- in the Missouri, Arkansas, Texas 
Gulf Coast and California irrigation regions, runoff could fall by 40% or more. 
In the Missouri, Rio Grande and Colorado basins, even current water needs could 
not be met by stream flows after the expected climatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
"One model we're looking at," says Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim 
Hightower, "predicts a 25% increase in the demand for irrigation water" from 
the Ogallala Aquifer, the great subterranean lake that irrigates the plains and 
is already badly depleted. "You can't pump more water if the well has already 
gone dry." 
</P>
<P>
Even areas that we're used to thinking of as ruined may be ruined in new and 
interesting ways. Lake Erie and the Great Lakes in general became symbols of 
the environmental decline in the 1970s. They have recovered somewhat, but a 
change in climate may subject them to unprecedented stresses (which is like 
subjecting the South Bronx to unprecedented decay). Under EPA models of doubled 
carbon dioxide levels, the average level of Lake Superior could fall by a foot 
and a half -- which doesn't sound like so much, except that the fleet of ships 
working the Great Lakes are designed to pass within a foot of the bottom of the 
locks and channels. Ships will have to carry smaller loads and sail more 
frequently (burning more fuel, which will . . . you know). 
</P>
<P>
Shippers may be aided by a longer shipping season. The central basin of Lake 
Erie currently sees 83 days of ice, but if the temperatures rise, only areas 
near shore will freeze, and then for three weeks or less. 
</P>
<P>
But in that case, the erosion along the shoreline, which has been protected by 
the ice, will increase, since the winter is the season of big storms. And if 
the ships do keep sailing, it may also increase the supply of sad folk songs -- 
it was a winter gale in 1975 that sank the Edmund Fitzgerald with all 29 hands. 
</P>
<P>
Declining water levels can cause a variety of miscellaneous mischief. When 
droughts lowered Lake Michigan in the 1960s, dry rot set in along the piers and 
pilings of Chicago's shoreline. Hydropower production may drop as flows along 
the Niagara River fall, pollutants in the lakes may become less diluted, and 
the warmer lake waters will almost certainly lead to algal blooms and a return 
of the oxygen deprivation that "killed " Lake Erie once before. 
</P>
<P>
That "increased eutrophication could make the Lake Erie Central Basin 
uninhabitable for fin fish and shellfish during the summer," concluded the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country and across the world the usual endless list of multiplying 
dangers can be compiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Water quality appears to be vulnerable to deterioration because of increased 
use of agricultural pesticides as a response to climate change," reported the 
EPA. There is an increased risk of forest fires like the 1988 Yellowstone blaze 
("The biggest difference between this year and other years is no rain," the 
park ecologist Donald Despain said after the fire). As usual, no one knows 
exactly what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
But the computer model used by Syukuroa Manabe of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration insists there's a greater than 90% chance that soil 
moisture across North America, Western Europe and Siberia will decrease. 
</P>
<P>
An obvious question is what all this means for agriculture (or, since 
"agriculture" has become abstracted from everyday life in the same fashion, as, 
say, "the military," it might be better to ask what this will mean as regards 
dinner). The answer comes on several levels, the first that of the individual 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Quite apart from heat and drought, the simple increase in the amount of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere affects plants. Ninety percent of the dry weight of a 
plant comes from the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates by 
photosynthesis. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else limits a plant's growth -- if it has plenty of sunshine, water 
and nutrients -- then increased carbon dioxide should increase the yield. And 
in ideal laboratory conditions this is what happens: As a result, some 
journalists have rhapsodized about "super-cucumbers," and found other green 
linings to the cloud of greenhouse gas. 
</P>
<P>
But there are drawbacks. If some crops grow more quickly, farmers may need to 
buy more fertilizer. Leaves may become richer in carbon but poorer in nitrogen, 
reducing food quality not only for humans but for nitrogen-craving insects who 
may eat more leaf to get their fix. 
</P>
<P>
In the best case, direct effects of increased carbon dioxide on yield are 
expected to be small: Annual harvests of well-tended corn crops might rise 
about 5% when carbon dioxide levels reach 400 parts per million, all other 
things being equal. 
</P>
<P>
But all other things, of course, won't be equal. All other things -- moisture, 
temperature, growing season -- will be different. 
</P>
<P>
It is an obvious point, but one worth repeating: Everything we eat, except fish 
and a few hothouse vegetables, spends its growing life in the open air, 
"exposed," in the words of biologist Paul Waggoner, "to the annual lottery of 
the weather." Today's Lean Cuisine frozen entree stood rooted in some Kansas 
field last year, where it survived attacks from insects and disease, and grew 
as fast as its supply of water and sunshine and nutrients allowed. About 50 
million acres of America's cropland and rangeland is irrigated, but even that 
depends on the weather over any long stretch. And we can't just stick the wheat 
crop under glass. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty ahead, in other words, extends to the pastures and the fields 
-- to our food supply. Too many unknowns and too many variables make even the 
broadest predictions difficult. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, there is a strong temptation to clutch at every reassurance: If the 
models say there will be enough food to go around, whew! 
</P>
<P>
 But when computers are modeling something as complex as all of agriculture, 
the potential for error is enormous (or the potential for accuracy is small). 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the heat and drought of 1988 made liars of most of the computer 
programs in just a few weeks. They had concluded that a doubling of carbon 
dioxide, which will not happen for several decades, might make the weather hot 
and dry enough to cut American corn and soybean yields as much as 27%. But in 
the summer of 1988, when the rains held off, the American corn crop fell more 
than 35%, down 2.6 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
Even if, as seems likely, the heat wave had little to do with the greenhouse 
effect, we now have some idea of what it will feel like once it does kick in. 
By early this year, grain storage around the world amounted to only about 250 
million metric tons, enough to last 54 days -- the lowest level since 1973. 
Worldwide consumption of grain outpaced worldwide production by 152 million 
metric tons last year. 
</P>
<P>
One can run a budget deficit for quite a while, but when the food runs out 
there's no central bank to mint some more. A second year of drought would be a 
"catastrophe," the assistant secretary of agriculture said. "If we return to a 
normal situation in the weather, we'll be OK," said Nelson Denlinger, executive 
vice president of the United States Wheat Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no normal situation in the weather to return to -- that's the 
point. The weather of the future cannot be predicted from the weather of the 
past, nor can its effects.
