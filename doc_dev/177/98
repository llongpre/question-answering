independence from Portugal in 1975 and fighting continues despite
peace talks. Associated Press correspondent Tony Smith traveled to

   By day, life in Luanda has been much the
same for 15 years: Armed soldiers stand on street corners, women
wait in line at dismal shops for the monthly rations of necessities,
and everyone looks tired.
   At night, war comes to the city, which less than a year ago was
cautiously preparing for peace.
   Four bombs have exploded in the capital this year. Most of Luanda
has been dark after sundown since rebels sabotaged 44 high-voltage
pylons east of Luanda in April. Sporadic gunfire can be heard until
dawn.
   Guerrilla sabotage has interrupted water supplies and delayed
food shipments, sending prices soaring in bustling black markets
that are much better supplied than state stores, where prices are
fixed.
   In April, the curfew began at midnight and most people ignored
it. Now it starts at 9.30 p.m. and is enforced by soldiers, who push
curfew-breakers into vans and take them to police stations for the
night.
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was angered by an army offensive deep
into his southern strongholds early this year and has stepped up
urban sabotage and bombings despite new peace efforts that began in
April. Most of the attacks have been in and around Luanda.
   In the dusty suburb of Palanca, a young soldier who identified
himself only as Ben leaned against the barred doors of a darkened
cafe and switched off the regular ``Good Morning, Combatant'' progam
on his transistor radio.
   ``It's not just that people are frightened to go out at night,''
he said. ``There's no electricity, so there's nowhere to go.''
   Bars and discos that provide Luandans with a release from the war
are becoming scarce.
   Last year, new bars and nightclubs began to thrive after
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire brought Savimbi and Jose Eduardo
dos Santos, Angola's president, together June 22 and the two foes
sealed a truce with a handshake.
   The cease-fire collapsed within days, however, and tentative
peace talks broke down soon afterward.
   In April, low-level officials from both sides held the first
discussions since then in Portugal, from which Angola gained its
independence 15 years ago. UNITA has called for a new truce, but
government delegates say agreement on terms and a future agenda must
come first.
   Dos Santos' government, still avowedly Marxist and backed by an
estimated $1.5 billion a year in Soviet military aid, has hinted it
might accept rebel demands for free multiparty elections, but only
when peace is well established.
   ``The government doesn't want to prolong a pernicious war when
political solutions are feasible among compatriots,'' the defense
minister, Gen. Pedro Maria Tonha, said on television last month.
   He said Operation Zebra, an offensive the government says
captured a strategic airstrip Feb. 2 at Mavinga, 700 miles southeast
of Luanda, shows the army ``has sufficient fighting power to silence
UNITA militarily.''
   Tonha spoke at a ceremony in southern Cuando-Cubango province,
where he decorated soldiers who fought in the campaign.
   On May 15, Lt. Col. Francisco Furtado, Zebra's chief of staff,
told foreign reporters visiting the southeastern military base at
Cuito Cuanavale that his soldiers were withdrawing from Mavinga
because it had ``lost its strategic importance.''
   A Defense Ministry statement in mid-May said that Mavinga, 90
miles south of Cuito Cuanavale, was firmly under government control
and that President dos Santos theatened to ``strangle'' the rebel
headquarters at Jamba, farther south, with long-range artillery
bombardment.
   UNITA claimed its fighters routed government troops well north of
the area last week, but Western diplomats in Lisbon, the capital of
Portugal, said intelligence reports gave no indication of such a
battle.
   Large troop movements through the Luanda airport support claims
by Western sources that two of four government battalions from the
Mavinga operation were being moved north to the new Cuanza-Bengo
front, which starts 35 miles east of Luanda. It is commanded by Gen.
Antonio dos Santos Franca, who planned Operation Zebra.
   Military sources in Luanda say the estimated 2,000 UNITA
guerrillas operating in small sabotage and ambush squads around the
capital should be no match for government ground and air offensives.
   Heavy fighting continues in northern Uige, Zaire and Malanje
provinces, near the border with Zaire, and rebels have attacked
government units guarding foreign oil installations near the coastal
city of Soyo, north of Luanda.
   Also, UNITA says it always can return to bush warfare, making
hit-and-run attacks on areas under government control.
   U.N. observers in Angola say more than 33,000 of the Cuban
soldiers who helped fight the rebellion since it began in 1975 have
returned home under U.S.-brokered accords signed by Angola, Cuba and
South Africa in December 1988. Cuba had about 50,000 military
personnel in Angola when the withdrawal began.
   Under the agreement, South Africa promised Namibia independence
and an end to its military and logisitcs support for UNITA.
   The rebels still receive about $50 million a year in U.S.
military aid, most of it funneled through Zaire. The State
Department has pledged to continue assistance until peace is
achieved.
