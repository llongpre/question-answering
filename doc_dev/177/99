   Two years ago, high water levels sent waves
crashing over miles of Great Lakes shoreline, chewing up beaches,
submerging marinas and causing millions of dollars in destruction.
   Today, drought has helped lake water levels drop up to 3 feet
since then _ good news for the suffering recreation industry and
for home owners who feared their property was doomed.
   ``The drought is having a major effect on lake levels,'' said
Frank Quinn, head of lake hydrology at the Great Lakes
Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   If the trend continues, the lakes will drop below their monthly
average levels for the first time in 10 to 15 years.
   Declining water levels have decreased the threat of erosion and
landslides and improved conditions for sunbathers and recreational
boaters, said Quinn, whose lab is operated by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``Our docks are 4 or 5 feet above water level,'' said Patty
Demink, who works at South Haven Municipal Marina. ``When I first
started coming here (two years ago), if it rained the water would
go over the docks.''
   Fred Harrington, 71, said that in 1986, he and his wife feared
their ``dream house,'' which sits 280 feet above Lake Michigan in
South Haven, might slip into the lake.
   ``About 50 feet of our frontage was destroyed in two
landslides,'' Harrington said. ``Now, we feel more confident that
we'll be able to stay here longer.''
   The Great Lakes have dropped 2 feet to 3 feet since their
record-highs in 1986, when waves left lakefront homes teetering on
scooped-out bluffs. On June 17, Lake Michigan was 31 inches lower
than it was in October 1986, Quinn said.
   In the last month, lakes Michigan and Huron dropped 2 inches,
Erie dropped 3 inches, Superior stayed the same and Ontario went up
an inch, he said.
   Lakes Michigan and Erie peaked in the first half of April and
have been steady or falling since, Quinn said.
   In an average year, the lakes do not peak until July or August,
but hot, dry weather has caused much water to evaporate, Quinn said.
   Even if the drought ends, most of the moisture from much-needed
rain would be absorbed by the parched soil and little would run
into the Great Lakes.
   The Army Corps of Engineers has considered diverting some water
from Lake Michigan to the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, which
have been drying up in the drought.
   ``Changing the diversions would only change the lake levels by a
matter of a couple of inches,'' Quinn said.
   A 1929 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a lawsuit, however, set
limits on how much water could be diverted from the lake into the
river system. The lawsuit was brought against Illinois by other
Great Lakes states and Canada, said Ross Fredenburg, a spokesman
for the North Central Division of the corps of engineers.
   Since then, the Supreme Court must be petitioned to change the
limit. The latest came in 1980 when the court said 3,200 cubic feet
per second could be diverted.
   William Wente, executive director of Wilmette Harbor, north of
Chicago, said although he is glad the water has dropped from levels
that swamped his marina two years ago, the shrinking trend has
drawbacks.
   ``We're a good 3 or 4 inches from where we were a month ago,''
he said. ``We've had to do a lot more dredging here in the harbor
entrance, and it's costing us more.''
   ``If it continues at this rate, it's going to be trouble in a
couple of years,'' he said.
