   The Navy has agreed that the Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard must observe Maine environmental laws and that fines
and fees for past violations will total more than $1 million, state
officials said Thursday.
   Still pending was whether the state has the authority to collect
the money from the federal government.
   The agreement is part of a consent decree that settles nearly
all of the issues in the state's lawsuit against the Navy stemming
from violations of Maine's hazardous-waste laws at the shipyard in
Kittery, Maine's southernmost town.
   While the two sides agree on the fine total, the Navy still
reserves the right to have the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
decide whether it actually has to pay, Maine Assistant Attorney
General Dennis J. Harnish said.
   ``Certainly the decision at the 1st Circuit will have a
substantial impact and this (consent decree) sets the stage for
that,'' Harnish said.
   At stake would be civil penalties of $887,200, and total
hazardous waste generator and licensing fees of $267,886, for a
total of nearly $1.16 million.
   Officials at the Portsmouth atomic submarine-repair facility's
public affairs office did not return telephone messages left
Thursday.
   Maine filed two lawsuits in 1986 asking that the shipyard be
required to clean up inactive solid waste and hazardous waste
dumps, including a landfill and a mercury disposal area.
   The state, in the suit that originated in York County Superior
Court, claimed that the Navy dumped hazardous wastes into a
treatment plant that could not handle them, gave wastes to
unlicensed handlers, illegally accepted wastes from other
installations and expanded its waste storage yard without the
state's approval.
   The state also charged that the shipyard was responsible for 14
oil spills and that it had not paid fees to the state for
generating hazardous wastes.
   In November 1988, U.S. District Judge Gene Carter rejected the
Navy's argument that the federal government had not waived its
immunity, allowing the state to impose its fines and fees.
   The Navy is appealing that ruling to the 1st Circuit Court, said
Harnish.
