   Europe's Ariane 3 rocket lifted off
on schedule Friday night for a mission to place French and U.S.
communications satellites into orbit and reaffirm its role as the
West's only active launcher.
   The rocket blasted off at 7:28 p.m. from this jungle space
center on the northern coast of South America _ Ariane's 21st
launching and the first of eight planned for this year.
   Andre Payet, chief of mission, said no technical problems were
reported and weather conditions were good for the launch of the
rocket, owned by the European Space Agency.
   The launch was first scheduled for December but was delayed for
extra tests after anomalies were detected in the oxygen and liquid
hydrogen third-stage engine.
   ``We preferred to take the time to understand the problem,''
said Frederic d'Allest, president of Arianespace, ESA's commercial
arm.
   Third-stage engine failure was the cause of three of Ariane's
four failed launches _ in September 1982, September 1985 and May
1986. The last failure, the 18th launch, left the rocket grounded
for more than a year.
   The other failed launch occurred in May 1980 because of a
problem with the first-stage engine.
   Ariane produced a perfect 20th launch Nov. 21, 1987, but the
West German television satellite it placed into orbit developed
problems with its solar panels and is not fully operational.
   The 21st launch will thrust into orbit the American GTE Spacenet
Corp.'s fifth satellite, Spacenet III R-Geostar R01. The satellite
is aimed at increasing the company's wide-ranging
telecommunications services in the United States and help set up a
system of satellite communication with mobile units such as trucks,
cars and trains.
   Two transponders on Spacenet III purchased by The Associated
Press are to provide the New York-based news cooperative with
domestic satellite delivery services over the next 10 years. A
satellite being used is nearing the end of its operational service.
   The French Telecom IC, the third in a series of satellites owned
by France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications system, is
used for telephones, radio and television transmissions as well as
military communications.
   The new satellite is to replace Telecom 1-B, which broke down
Jan. 15.
   With the U.S. space shuttle grounded and Titan 4 and Delta
rockets not yet competitive, Ariane remains the only active
launcher for commercial satellites in the West. However,
Arianespace is watching the return of the Americans to the
lucrative space market as well as competition from the Soviet
Union, China and Japan.
   Including Friday's payload, Arianespace has 43 satellites on its
order books worth $2.36 billion, according to the company.
   To keep up with the orders, the Kourou space center has made two
launch pads available.
   Ariane's 21st launch is to be the first of eight this year, with
nine launches each planned for 1989 and 1990, d'Allest said earlier
this week.
