   Nearly half the 1,100
federal troops sent to maintain order on St. Croix after Hurricane
Hugo have returned home following a presidential order to withdraw.
   About 250 troops returned home aboard C-141 transport planes
Tuesday. On Sunday, the first 250 were flown back to the States,
said Joint Task Force spokesman Maj. Doug Foster.
   ``We should all be home for Thanksgiving,'' he said.
   The C-141 and C-130 transport planes were constantly flying in
and out of the island to evacuate heavy equipment and vehicles
brought by the soldiers when they arrived on Sept. 21, four days
after Hugo's ravaged the island.
   President Bush ordered the withdrawal last week following a
request by Gov. Alexander Farrelly, who said the troops, most of
them from Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Bragg, N.C., were no longer
needed.
   The U.S. troops were sent to curb looting and help local
authorities maintain order. Most stores had already been sacked of
food and other commodities by the time the soldiers arrived.
   ``It's important for the Virgin Islands National Guard and the
police to get back on their own feet now,'' Foster said.
   Farrelly's request for the pullout was criticized by three
business organizations, the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce, the Board
of Realtors and a civic group called the United Concerned Citizens
of St. Croix.
   They charged the governor reneged on his promise to keep the
federal troops until all power and telephone services were restored.
   Hugo caused more than $500 million in damage to the U.S. Virgin
Islands, mostly on St. Croix, where most of the 52,000 residents
were left homeless.
