   Lebanon's political history has been
plauged by violence and turmoil.
   Since independence from France in 1943, Lebanon's nine
presidents have grappled with sectarian fighting, coup attempts and
invasion by foreign forces.
   The latest victim was Rene Mouawad, who was elected president by
an emergency session of Parliament Nov. 5 in Syrian-controlled
north Lebanon and served only 17 days before his assassination
Wednesday.
   The first president was Bishara Khoury, who was released from
his cell in a French prison when Parliament elected him Sept. 21,
1943. The French-educated trial lawyer headed the Christian-Moslem
National Resistance against the French, who ruled Lebanon under a
League of Nations mandate from 1920 to 1943.
   In 1950, forces loyal to Khoury and his Sunni Moslem prime
minister, Riyad Solh, suppressed a two-week revolt by the Syrian
Social Nationalist Party aimed at making Lebanon part of a
``greater Syria.'' Syrian nationalist leader Antoine Saadeh was
executed.
   A year later, Solh was assassinated on a visit to Jordan.
   In 1952, Khoury resigned after protest demonstrations broke out
when he sought to amend the constitution to extend his term.
   Parliament elected Camille Chamoun, a former U.N. ambassador and
a Maronite Catholic chieftain who survived four assassination
attempts to complete his six-year term.
   Chamoun asked for American help in 1958 when he faced a Moslem
revolt inspired by Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser's radical
pan-Arabism. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent 10,000 U.S.
Marines to Beirut in July 1958 and the rebellion fizzled.
   Chamoun's successor, army Gen. Fuad Chehab, crushed a coup
attempt on New Year's Eve by pro-Syrian army officers in 1959.
   Lawyer Charles Helou, elected in 1964, ruled as Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian guerrillas built up their power base in Lebanon. In
1969, the Lebanese army clashed with Arafat's fighters in street
battles in south Beirut.
   Helou's successor, pro-Syrian Maronite Suleiman Franjieh,
oversaw the clashes between Christians and Palestinians that
triggered the civil war in April 1975. More than 150,000 people
have died since then.
   Parliament came under shellfire when Elias Sarkis, a former
Central Bank governor, was elected in 1976 with strong Syrian
backing. During his term the Israelis invaded in 1978 and 1982.
   Bashir Gemayel, the Israeli-backed commander of the Christians'
main militia was elected to replace him. Gemayel, 34, was
assassinated in an east Beirut bombing Sept. 14, 1982, a week
before he was to be sworn in.
   Parliament unanimously elected his elder brother, Amin. His
reign saw the advent of Iranian-sponsored Shiite terrorism,
including the kidnapping of Westerners and the suicide bombings of
U.S. and French military bases.
   Gemayel stepped down Sept. 22, 1988, with Parliament unable to
elect a successor. He left Lebanon in shambles and now lives in
France.
