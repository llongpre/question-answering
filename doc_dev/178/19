   The recently resigned head of Soviet space
research says his country's maiden space shuttle launch had
``absolutely no scientific value,'' and the U.S. and Soviet shuttle
programs are in ``deep trouble'' economically.
   Roald Z. Sagdeev, who headed the Soviet Space Research Institute
for 15 years, said last week's inaugural Soviet shuttle flight _
like the 1981 flight of the first U.S. shuttle _ was an
``outstanding technological achievement.''
   The shuttle, however, ``is technology of the 21st century. Why
should we pay 20th century money for it?''
   ``My personal view is that American experience with the shuttle
indicates that from the point of view of cost efficiency, the
shuttle is in deep trouble,'' said Sagdeev, who has followed closely
the U.S. decision-making process on the shuttle and is a key science
and arms control adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   The Air Force is bringing the B-2 stealth
bomber, the crown jewel of its super secret ``black inventory,'' out
from behind the veil of secrecy that has shrouded it for a decade.
   The high-technology flying-wing aircraft, designed to penetrate
enemy radar defense and drop nuclear bombs, was being unveiled today
by Northrop Corp. at a rollout ceremony _ although at a secure
distance of 200 feet.
   ``It is simply not comparable to anything ever done before. It is
the first real computer-age aircraft,'' Northrop spokesman Les Daly
said Monday in one of the aerospace company's first public
pronouncements about the B-2.
   Daly referred to an aircraft that has not yet flown and which the
General Accounting Office estimates could cost taxpayers up to $68.5
billion if the Pentagon builds the 132 aircraft-fleet sought by the
Air Force.

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case says
President Reagan should consider the ``various courses of action he
may take'' to stop the trial of Oliver L. North to prevent national
security secrets from being disclosed.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell did not say that Reagan
should consider pardoning the four Iran-Contra defendants but
suggested other means by which the trial could be stopped.
   He said that under the Classified Information Procedures Act,
Reagan could declare that the danger of disclosing highly sensitive
government secrets was so great that the charges must be dropped.
The president, as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, could
either directly order the case dropped or he could invoke secrecy
laws to prevent disclosure of classified information, which could
have the same effect.
   ``The Constitution does not permit the court to take this
testimony in secret, as did the Congress. It must be public,''
Gesell said, adding he would have ``very little control over the
content of the testimony.''

   The high school ring was torn from the Navy
flier's hand in the final moments of his life on Memorial Day 1944,
lost on a mountaintop in a jumble of debris from the collision of a
B-24 bomber and a fighter plane.
   The ring belonging to Clinton Baker, St. Cloud (Minn.) Technical
High School, Class of 1942, lay undiscovered on Palomar Mountain in
northern San Diego County for 44 years.
   One week ago, a hiker pulled it from the dirt and, thanks to the
determined efforts of his stepfather, helped to rekindle memories of
a long-dead brother and friend a half a continent away.
   ``A real shocker,'' said the dead flier's 54-year-old brother,
Larry Baker, of his reaction to the discovery. ``These are things
you try to put behind you.
