   A fugitive arrested in the 1976 car bombing
that killed the former Chilean ambassador was being held without
bond awaiting trial in Washington, D.C.
   Jose Dionisio Suarez y Esquivel, 51, arrested at his St.
Petersburg home early Wednesday, waived his rights to a bond
hearing before a federal magistrate here on charges of conspiracy
to murder a foreign official.
   Suarez is accused of providing the explosives and detonating
devices in the explosion that killed former Chilean Ambassador
Orlando Letelier and business colleague Ronni Moffitt as they drove
to work in Washington on Sept. 21, 1976.
   U.S. officials said they expect the new Chilean government to
prosecute top intelligence officials of the former military
government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on charges of planning
Letelier's assassination, The New York Times reported today. The
killings long have been a sore point in relations between the
United States and Chile.
   In Washington, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., welcomed the
arrest and commended the FBI, but said, ``Unfortunately, the
masterminds of this atrocity remain at large in Chile. I hope and
expect that the new democratic government in that nation will do
all in its power to bring them to justice.''
   A former Chilean diplomat, Jose Miguel Barros, testified in a
Chilean court last year that Letelier's assassination was ordered
by Chilean army Gen. Juan Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who headed
the Chilean National Intelligence Agency.
   Pinochet stepped down as president last month after the election
of a civilian, Patricio Aylwin.
   U.S. marhals said Suarez would be flown to Washington as early
as Saturday. If convicted, he could face life in prison.
   FBI agents said Suarez had been leading a secretive, cautious
life in St. Petersburg, rarely even leaving the house.
   ``To our knowledge, he hasn't been employed in the last 12 to 14
years,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Furr.
   But his 30-year-old wife Elizabeth said Suarez worked at home as
an artist and never realized his face had been plastered in post
offices and courthouses around the country for more than a decade.
   ``No one ever notified him he was a fugitive,'' said Mrs.
Suarez, a hospital administration employee and mother of a
15-month-old boy. She said they have lived either in Tampa or St.
Petersburg throughout their nine-year marriage.
   Letelier served as Chilean ambassador to the United States in
1971-1973, during the presidency of Salvador Allende, who was
ousted by Pinochet in a coup. Letelier had begun to emerge as a
leading international critic of Pinochet when he and Moffitt were
assassinated.
   Michael V. Townley, a U.S. citizen who also was an employee of
the Chilean intelligence agency, was arrested in April 1978.
Townley was extradited to the United States, confessed to planting
the bomb on the order of superiors and spent 40 months in prison.
   According to the FBI, Townley, Suarez and fugitive Virgilio
Pablo Paz built the bomb used in the assassination. Suarez
allegedly provided the explosives and detonators and purchased the
bomb parts.
   A federal grand jury also indicted three Chilean army personnel
in connection with the case.
   Maj. Armando Fernandez Larios pleaded guilty to being an
accessory after the fact to Letelier's death and was sentenced to
22 months in custody. The Justice Department has failed to obtain
the extradition of two others.
