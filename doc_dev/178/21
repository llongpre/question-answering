   President Elias Hrawi declared the
Cabinet of the rebellious army chief, Gen. Michel Aoun, dissolved
Saturday and named a new government to end 14 years of civil war.
His predeccesor, slain after 17 days in office, was buried.
   In a rare display of national unity, businesses in both Moslem
and Christian areas closed for a nationwide day of mourning for
Rene Mouawad, killed by a bomb Wednesday.
   Church bells rang and bands struck slow drum beats as his
flag-draped coffin inched through crowds in Mouawad's hometown of
Zgorta. His widow, Nayla, and daughter Rima and son Michel walked
sobbing behind the cortege.
   Weeping women tossed roses and waved from balconies.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite
community, presided over the service, and Papal Nuncio Paolo Ponte
read a message from Pope John Paul II, saying the pontiff was
praying for Lebanon's salvation.
   A 21-gun salute was fired as the coffin was put into a crypt at
St. Mary's Church, where it will remain until completion of a tomb
at the cemetery.
   Aoun said Hrawi's election Friday was ``as unconstitutional as
that of Mouawad. Both have been elected under Syrian occupation.''
   ``They should have waited to find out who killed Mouawad before
appointing a new president,'' he said in a statement.
   No one has claimed responsibility for Mouawad's assassination.
   Hrawi put himself on a collision course with Aoun by dismissing
the general's military Cabinet before dawn and forming a national
unity government with members from Lebanon's seven major sects.
   The new government, under Sunni Moslem Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, is to oversee implementation of an Arab League-brokered plan
to introduce political reforms aimed at ending the civil war, which
has killed more than 150,000 people.
   Aoun rejects the accord, which was approved by parliamentarians
in October and which cleared the way for Mouawad's election Nov. 5.
The military general said the plan is unacceptable because it does
not provide a timetable for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops
from Lebanon.
   Mouawad, 64, and 23 other people were killed Wednesday by a
remote-controlled bomb in Moslem west Beirut.
   It was not clear how Hrawi and Hoss would go about removing Aoun
to head off final partition of the country. Aoun commands the
loyalty of a cohesive army of about 20,000 that stands as the
nation's mightiest fighting machine.
   But his troops are outnumbered and outgunned by the Syrians,
whose soldiers control 70 percent of Lebanese territory under a
1976 Arab League mandate to quell civil war fighting.
   State-run television in Beirut said Hrawi, Hoss and Defense
Minister Albert Mansour were meeting possibly to discuss dismissing
Aoun and appointing a new army commander.
   Aoun is holding out with his troops in the country's Christian
enclave, comprising east Beirut and land to the north. He said his
Cabinet is Lebanon's only legitimate government.
   The 54-year-old soldier, a Maronite Christian like Hrawi, was
named to head an interim Cabinet by outgoing President Amin Gemayel
on Sept. 22, 1988, because Parliament was unable to agree on a new
president.
   Lebanon had been without a president since then until
parliamentarians approved the peace plan and then elected Mouawad.
   Hoss, whom Mouawad selected to be prime minister, also was named
prime minister by Hrawi, in addition to foreign minister.
   He retained Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt as public works
minister, and Shiite Moslem militia chieftain Nabih Berri as
minister of electrical and water resources. Berri also was given
the housing and cooperatives portfolio.
   Jumblatt and Berri are Syria's main allies in Lebanon. They
fielded the largest Moslem militias in the war against the
Christians.
   Michel Sassine, a Greek Orthdox offered the position of deputy
premier and labor minister, turned down the post and flew to Paris
without explaining why, state-run television in Beirut reported.
   Hoss introduced George Saadeh, leader of the right-wing Phalange
Party, Lebanon's largest Christian political force, into the new
government as minister of post and telecommunications.
   Saadeh, a Maronite based in the Christian enclave controlled by
Aoun's army, said his participation must first be approved by his
party's Politburo.
   Also Saturday, Israeli jets blasted Palestinian targets in
eastern Lebanon for the second time in three days, wounding two
guerrillas, in the 16th such air raid on the country this year.
   The target was a Bekaa base of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General command.
   Police said at least two PFLP-GC fighters were wounded as two
fighter-bombers fired six rockets into the base in two runs at
10:50 a.m.
