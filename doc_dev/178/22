  [Text] Washington, 6 May (XINHUA) -- A six-member 
delegation headed by Zhang Dengyi, secretary general of the 
State Science and Technology Commission, yesterday held a report 
meeting at the Chinese Embassy in Washington to brief U.S. 
Government officials and people from U.S. enterprise and 
environmental protection circles on the contents of the "China 
21st Century Agenda." 
  The agenda, which was recently approved by the State 
Council, 
is a detailed program of action prepared by the Chinese 
Government for implementing the strategy of sustained 
development decided on in June 1992 by the UN Conference on the 
Environment and Development. It is the first document submitted 
in response to the "21st Century Agenda" adopted by the UN 
conference. 
  In his speech, Zhang Dengyi said: The central idea of the 
"China 21st Century Agenda" is to carry through the strategy of 
sustained development, and, in light of China's reality, to 
establish unified policies on economic construction, social 
work, environmental protection, natural resources utilization, 
human resources development, and other important issues, in 
order to achieve comprehensive results in every aspect and to 
attain the most desirable objectives. 
  Zhang Dengyi added: China has decided to inject the 
substance 
of the agenda, especially the important principles in it, into 
actual practices in all sectors. In particular, we will 
incorporate some key programs outlined in the agenda in the 
Ninth "Five-Year Plan for Economic Development" and in other 
plans whose duration is longer. 
  He stressed: China has determined to take concrete measures 
in the hope that it will become the first country to fulfill the 
"21st Century Agenda." To fulfill this hope, we must cooperate 
with other countries. 
  He said that China welcomes the more than 30 attendees of 
the 
report meeting to attend a high-level roundtable meeting on the 
"China 21st Century Agenda" -- to be held in Beijing on 9 July 
-- to discuss ways to carry out the strategy of sustained 
development and to study the possibility of international 
cooperation in this field with broad prospects. 
  The delegation arrived in Washington on 4 May at the 
invitation of the U.S. Presidential Committee on Sustained 
Development. The delegation yesterday called on host officials 
and visited the World Bank and the World Resources Study Center. 
While in New York, the delegation called on three UN deputy 
secretaries general and other UN officials, in winning some 
international organs' support for carrying out the "China 21st 
Century Agenda." 
  After its U.S. visit, the delegation will fly to Ottawa, the 
capital of Canada, on 8 May.
