JAMES FLANIGAN: NEXT STAGE OF SPACE TRAVEL IS BIG BUSINESS

Enthusiasm for space exploration is rising once again. The pictures and 
accounts of Neptune and the ice volcanoes of its moon Triton inspired renewed 
support for space. And President Bush, on last month's anniversary of the 
Apollo moon landing, gave it focus by setting a long-term goal of a mission to 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The business of space is getting a boost also. On Sunday, McDonnell Douglas 
picked up a $50-million fee for the launch aboard its Delta rocket of a 
communications satellite for a commercial customer, British Satellite 
Broadcasting. McDonnell Douglas has orders for eight more launches and is 
bidding for a ninth in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
It is not alone in the business. Martin Marietta, whose big Titan rocket will 
launch two satellites at once in November, has orders for three more such dual 
launches and is negotiating for a fourth. General Dynamics has 28 launches 
backlogged for its Atlas rocket, 10 of them for a Navy project with Hughes 
Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
And small firms are very active, with sounding rockets that carry industrial 
experiments into the zero-gravity conditions of the suborbital atmosphere. 
American Rocket Co., Camarillo, will launch experiments for Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and the Strategic Defense Initiative on Sept. 20. Space 
Services Inc. of Houston -- former astronaut Deke Slayton's firm -- 
successfully sent up a rocket in March carrying eight experiments for the 
University of Alabama at Huntsville.

Gearing Up for 21st Century 
</P>
<P>
So are all systems go for a boom in space? Not quite. What is happening today 
is an industrial revival from the shutdown that followed the Challenger space 
shuttle disaster in 1986. U.S. rocket makers now see "an attractive, albeit 
thin, market," says Alan Lovelace, general manager of General Dynamics space 
systems division. But they recognize that today's full order books are the 
result of the backlog that developed in the Challenger aftermath, when nothing 
was launched, and that when things settle down, the orders will be only a 
trickle. Hughes Aircraft, the leading satellite maker with more than half the 
40 commercial satellites now in space, estimates about five launches a year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet today's renewed enthusiasm is important, helping U.S. industry to begin the 
real work of the next decade, which will be laying the groundwork of space 
platforms and communications systems for the wide-ranging exploration of space 
that is sure to come in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
And the revival is timely because competitors have been active. The European 
space consortium, Arianespace -- funded by 13 individual nations -- leads the 
world; it has put up 23 satellites in the past four years and has orders to 
launch almost four dozen more. China and the Soviet Union are offering launch 
services at cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Japan has ambitious plans for space. In 1992, Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries will launch its H-2 rocket, and in the mid-1990s will put up 
the Japan Environmental Module, which is scheduled to accompany the U.S. space 
station. Beyond that, Japanese companies are being encouraged to think big by 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which is holding a 
competition for ideas on space exploration in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite today's enthusiasm, U.S. industry may not have smooth 
sailing when Congress gets the $30-billion bill for the space station, 
scheduled for launch in 1995 and envisioned as both a center for experiments 
and a platform for planetary exploration. There will be cries that it's a 
boondoggle and that space isn't a real profit-making business anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not true. First, as the Europeans and Japanese understand, projects 
like the space station are needed to support the early stages of a new 
industry. And profit margins on space business are already good, says Donald 
Robinson, vice president of planning for American Rocket. American charges 
$800,000 a launch on small rockets and earns $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, space is a business with a considerable record of success. Today's 
commercial rocket launches are not the dawn of the space business but the 
second stage of a developing industry, says General Dynamics' Lovelace, a 
one-time NASA official. Communications satellites -- the first stage -- have 
been a business for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have launches, space-age trucking really. And the next stages, Lovelace 
says, will be in Earth remote sensing -- bringing to commercial business the 
work being done by spy satellites -- and weather control. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, today's enthusiasm is not misplaced. Space exploration has already 
brought us wonders that we take for granted -- the techniques of image 
enhancement for pictures from space have brought our hospitals computerized and 
magnetic resonance brain and body scanning. And while U.S. industry must now 
make up for some lost time, the advances of U.S. computer technology give 
America an edge in space for the decade ahead. What will be needed most in the 
1990s is to keep up the enthusiasm and the vision -- and that is suddenly 
easier to do thanks to the triumphal pictures from Neptune and Triton.
