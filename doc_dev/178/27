Rathbun-Nealy -- celebrated her 21st birthday with a surprise party thrown by

<TEXT>     "I feel real good," Rathbun-Nealy, of Newaygo, Mich., told reporters before
boarding a VIP plane that carried 20 of the Americans home. She declined to
comment when asked about her treatment by Iraqi captors.;    She said her
thoughts were of returning to her parents' home and her fiance.;    A C-141
medical evacuation plane carried the 21st POW, who required a hospital gurney,
on the 21-hour flight. Both planes, which left at 11 p.m. (noon PST) , were
headed to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.;    Waiting to welcome
the 19 men and two women and deliver the nation's thanks were Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.;    The POWs were expected to be invited to the White House later today
or Monday to receive the thanks of President Bush.;    Amid the euphoria was
the sobering thought that nine U.S. servicemen are still missing in action,
all airmen who went down in Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps planes. The
Pentagon said it was pressing Iraq for information on the MIAs.;    The POWs
were initially treated aboard the U.S. hospital ship Mercy off Bahrain after
their release in two groups in Baghdad last Monday and Wednesday.;    Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of U.S. forces in Operation Desert Storm,
hailed them as "every one a hero.";    The Mercy's chief medical officer said
some of the POWs were struck by their captors and had periods when they were
given only bread or water. But the POWs praised Iraqi medical officials, said
the official, Navy Capt. Dick Osborne.  </TEXT>
