   The clout of this country's Maronite
Catholics, who have dominated its politics for a half century, is
rapidly crumbling amid blood feuds and a new Moslem ascendancy.
   The end of an era is looming for the only Christians in the
overwhelmingly Moslem Middle East to have controlled a state since
the Crusaders in the Middle Ages.
   The Gemayels, Chamouns and Franjiehs - the clans that have ruled
fractious Lebanon since independence from France in 1943 - are
entangled in a new round of vendettas that will probably seal their
fate.
   The Oct. 21 slaying of Maronite political leader Dany Chamoun
and most of his family was the latest.
   ``No one listens to the voice of reason,'' Papal Nuncio Pablo
Puente lamented recently. ``Christians are destroying Christians in
senseless bloodbaths.''
   The nearly 1 million Maronites, the main Christian sect in
Lebanon, have suffered more from their own feuds than from conflict
with Moslems in the nation's 15-year-old civil war.
   Under a proposed Arab League-brokered peace plan, the Maronites
would have to share power with Moslems, who now comprise a majority
of the 3.5 million people in a nation where Islamic fundamentalism
is on the rise.
   But many Maronites are reluctant to give up their privileges.
   ``I'm afraid we're going to go back to even worse times if the
Maronite establishment fails to respond to the winds of change,''
warned Elie Hobeika, a Syrian-backed leftist Maronite at odds with
the dominant right-wingers of his sect.
   Hobeika foresaw the need for the Maronites to give ground or
eventually perish and signed a Syrian-brokered peace treaty with
the main Moslem warlords in 1985, when he headed the Christians'
main militia, the Lebanese Forces.
   But he was ousted by right-wing diehards the next year and fled
to territory controlled by the Syrians, who have about 40,000
troops in Lebanon.
   Hobeika returned to the Christian heartland northeast of Beirut
after Syrian and government troops crushed rebel Maronite Gen.
Michel Aoun on Oct. 13, removing the main obstacle to the new peace
plan.
   The return of Hobeika, 34, has raised fears of a showdown
between him and Samir Geagea, the right-wing Maronite who ousted
him in 1986 in a shootout that claimed the lives of 350 Christians.
   But even without the feuding, the power of the Maronite
political dynasties has ebbed.
   Christianity has been on the retreat in the Middle East for
years. Christian leaders noted at a recent conference in Cyprus
that Christian emigration from the region, including Lebanon, is
growing amid rising Islamic fundamentalism.
   There are an estimated 12 million Christians in the Middle East
compared with about 120 million Moslems.
   The Maronites - named for St. Maroun, a 5th century Syrian-born
monk who settled in the pine-covered Lebanese mountains - have seen
themselves as part a centuries-old fight for survival against
Islam.
   Yet their reluctance to share power with Moslems helped ignite
the civil war, which has left more than than 150,000 people dead.
   ``They're the only Christian community with a distinct political
history,'' said Prof. Kamal Salibi, who teaches history at the
American University of Beirut. ``They fear being overwhelmed. If
the system is democratized, they'll be outvoted and they can't
carry the day.''
   Of Lebanon's three great Maronite patriarchs, only 79-year-old
Suleiman Franjieh is alive. His rivals, Pierre Gemayel and Camille
Chamoun, survived several assassination attempts and died of
natural causes.
   Now their heirs are at each others' throats.
   Patriarch Nasralla Sfeir, the Maronite's spiritual head, has
proved helpless in efforts to try to reconcile them.
   His appeals for cease-fires and threats of excommunication have
gone unheeded, a far cry from the days when Maronite politicians
took their instructions from the patriarch.
   Two days after Aoun was crushed, gunmen killed Dany Chamoun, his
wife and two small sons at their home east of Beirut.
   Chamoun was a staunch supporter of Aoun and the slayings
appeared to be aimed at ending the political legacy founded by
Chamoun's father, Camille.
   Other scores have also to be settled among the Maronite clans.
   Phalangist militiamen loyal to Pierre Gemayel's youngest son,
Bashir, attacked Franjieh's domain in north Lebanon on June 13,
1978, and slaughtered his son and political heir, Tony, along with
his wife and daughter and 21 bodyguards.
   Geagea led the assault and the elder Franjieh, a close friend of
Syrian President Hafez Assad, vowed revenge. So far, the massacre
has gone unanswered.
   Bashir Gemayel made no secret two years later that he ordered
his men to slaughter more than 300 members of Chamoun's Tigers
militia north of Beirut.
   Gemayel was elected President Aug. 23, 1982, with Israel's
backing. But he was assassinated in a bombing at Phalange
headquarters in Beirut on Sept. 14, 1982, a week before he was to
be sworn in. The bombing was blamed on a leftist pro-Syrian faction
dominated by Greek Orthodox Christians.
   Gemayel's elder brother, Amin, was elected as his successor.
   But when Amin's violence-ridden term ended in 1988, he fled to
self-imposed exile in Paris, signaling the end of the Gemayel
dynasty.
   Tony Franjieh's son, Suleiman Jr., 23, contends his father was
not avenged by Bashir Gemayel's death. He is reported to be waiting
in the Franjieh's power base of Zghorta to send his 2,000-strong
militia against Geagea.
