   President Siad Barre of Somalia on
Saturday marked the 21st anniversary of the military coup that put
him in power by ordering the release of 1,278 prisoners, government
radio said.
   Radio Mogadishu gave no further details of the presidential
amnesty, saying only the prisoners had been ``jailed for various
crimes.'' The broadcast was monitored in Nairobi.
   Barre, a major general, seized power in a bloodless coup on Oct.
21, 1968, to prevent the election to the presidency of a civilian
opposed by the army.
   Since then, Barre's socialist government has been plagued by
opposition groups. Western rights organizations and Somali refugees
say Barre has ruthlessly suppressed opposition in the east African
nation.
   In 1981, the Somalia National Movement was formed and has been
fighting the government to press for Barre's ouster. Somalia also
is plagued by clan violence.
   Thousands of people have fled to neighboring countries.
   A report commissioned by the U.S. State Department and released
in in September accused government troops of murdering an estimated
5,000 unarmed members of a northern clan in an 11-month period that
ended in March.
   Somalia became independent in 1960 after the unification of the
north and south, colonized by Britain and Italy respectively.
