U.S. Military Presence Seen In the 21st Century As Tension 
Mitigates"] 
  [Text] National security policy planners are required to 
foresee what is ahead in the next l0 years or more -- if 
possible 30 years -- and at the same time, to review the past 
and present situation. 
  If the upcoming national defense buildup program is going to 
cover a five-year period as it has previously, it will cover the 
period from fiscal year 1996 to 2000. 
  Warships, aircraft, and the like requisitioned under the 
program are to be made ready, and the reorganization of units is 
to be completed sometime around 2005. This equipment will be 
deployed and used at the first-line until 2025 or 2030. 
  Planning a security program from the viewpoint of today's 
situation will render the future policy completely inadequate. 
  Although it is impossible to correctly predict the world and 
domestic situation or the development of scientific technology, 
a challenge must be made to guarantee security. 
  Today's utmost concern is the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms 
development program and its stalled economy, but it is highly 
likely these issues will be settled by the early part of the 
next century. 
A Reduction of U.S. Forces in Japan Is Possible [subhead] 
  In May, the 21st Century Committee, an advisory organ of ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam, submitted a report entitled: "The 
Republic of Korea in the 21st Century," predicting "the high 
possibility of the DPRK's economic collapse within three to five 
years, and Korean unification by 2020." 
  Last year, the DPRK was presumed to have produced 3,880,000 
tons of grain, comprising 60 percent of the 6,500,000 tons it 
actually needed; the lack of foreign exchange reserves prevented 
it from importing foodstuffs. If this situation continues, the 
North Korean economy will not last long. 
  Meanwhile, if the DPRK adopts an open-door policy in order 
to 
attract foreign investment, the foundation of the Worker's 
Party-controlled DPRK regime -- which has shut off information 
from foreign countries and given its people falsified reports of 
the poverty-ridden ROK -- will be shaken. The report's contents 
are thus considered timely. 
  Russia's armed forces have experienced considerable 
hollowing 
out in the Far East, with less and less requisitioning of new 
arms and equipment. There are even insufficient personnel funds 
to pay wages -- because of the late payment and non-payments of 
officers' wages, their wives and children held a demonstration 
in Sakhalin. It will require decades for Russia to regain its 
status as a military power. 
  The modernization program of the Chinese armed forces is 
progressing at a far slower pace than those of Japan, the ROK, 
and Taiwan (Republic of China). The United States, which 
informed the world of "China bending toward expanded armaments," 
has completely reversed its position from that of last year. 
  The U.S. Department of Defense approached China for a 
"U.S.-Chinese military exchange," to see if the United States 
can sell its weaponry to China. However, the Chinese Government 
seems to be in no position to allow rapid modernization of its 
armed forces, because of perennial huge budget deficits since 
1986. Nominal increases in the publicly announced defense 
budget are huge but are paralleled by the inflation rate. 
  When the Korean peninsula is united, a drastic reduction in 
U.S. Armed Forces in Japan will be possible. This is especially 
true of the U.S. Third Marine Division which maintains a large 
complex of facilities on Okinawa. Originally, the division was 
intended for landing operations in the case of contingencies on 
the Korean peninsula, and was on the verge of dissolution last 
year in former Defense Secretary Les Aspin's plan [sentence as 
published]. But it has survived temporarily because of tensions 
revolving around the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development 
program. 
  The 12th Marine Air Group at Iwakuni, with about 60 aircraft 
comprised of FA-18 Hornet fighter bombers and AV-8 Harriers, 
will become defunct when the Third Marine Division is dissolved 
as it supports the Marines. 
<H5>  The U.S. Is Going Allout To Stop Financial Deterioration </H5>
  The 18th Air Wing with 54 F-15 Eagle fighter-bombers at 
Kadena Airbase on Okinawa is ready to send reinforcement to the 
ROK. Even now several Eagles are being dispatched to Osan 
Airbase. This unit will become obsolete. 
  The landing crafts at Sasebo are for the transport of the 
Third Marine Division and they can be reduced. The old-type 
aircraft carrier Independence and its escort ships at Yokosuka 
need not remain in Japan. The carrier may be destined for 
retirement from service. The 432d Air Wing with 48 F-16 
Fighting Falcons at Misawa Airbase, Aomori Prefecture, will lose 
its reason for being there as the United States and Russia are 
now partners, and if the Korean peninsula is unified. 
  The colossal U.S. financial deficit has no prospects of 
being 
reduced, and the danger of the dollar's collapse in value 
constitutes the biggest factor in world instability. 
  The United States is compelled to make its prime objective 
preventing the financial deficit from deteriorating further, in 
order to protect its economic order and that of the world. 
  Even if the Japan-U.S. security system remains effective in 
the 21st century, it will become something close to an "alliance 
without U.S. military presence." Historically speaking, that is 
an ordinary form of alliance.
