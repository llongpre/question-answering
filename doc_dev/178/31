a peace group founded by American and Soviet doctors.
   One year ago: The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly voted

however, vetoed the bill, and the veto was upheld.)
   Today's Birthdays: Choreographer Jerome Robbins is 72. Singer
Dottie West is 58. Singer-musician Daryl Hall is 42.
   Thought for Today: ``If we would only give, just once, the same
amount of reflection to what we want to get out of life that we
give to the question of what to do with a two weeks' vacation, we
would be startled at our false standards and the aimless procession
of our busy days.'' - Dorothy Canfield Fisher, American author and
essayist (1879-1958).
