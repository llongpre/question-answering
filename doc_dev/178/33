  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- The South Korea-U.S. 
21st Century Council is due to be born on Feb. 17 and 
political, business, academic and press leaders from the two 
countries will hold their first four-day meeting in Washington, 
Korean-side Secretary General Sakong Il said Friday. 
  The basic idea behind the council is for Korean and American 
leaders from all walks of life to get together and discuss 
bilateral cooperation and resolution of problems to achieve 
forward-looking relations in the post-Cold War era, the former 
finance minister told reporters. 
  Sakong, president of the Institute for Global Economics, 
represents Korea, while Fred Bergsten and his Institute for 
International Economics (IIE) will manage U.S. affairs. 
  The Korea Foundation and IIE are to sponsor the 
non-governmental dialogue channel that will exchange expertise 
on a wide range of issues. 
  With about 30 participants from each side, the council will 
meet in Korea and the United States in turn every year behind 
closed doors. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will make an opening speech at 
the inaugural meeting in Washington. He is among seven senior 
government officials invited along with ambassador to Washington 
Han Sung-su and Assistant Foreign Minister Son Chun-yong. 
  The six politicians attending include Rep. Chong Che-mun, 
chairman of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and National 
Unification Committee, and Cho Son-song of the Democratic Party. 
  Lucky-Goldstar Group Chairman Ku Pyong-hoe, Ssangyong Group 
Chairman Kim Sok-won and six other business leaders, 14 eminent 
professors and journalists, plus former Government 
Administration Minister Choe Chang-yun will also take part. 
  Among the participating Americans are Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, 
Laura Tyson, chairman of the Economic Advisers, Robert Fauver, 
special assistant to the president for national security and 
economic policy at the National Security Council, and Winston 
Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific 
affairs, as well as business and press leaders.
