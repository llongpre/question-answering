   A U.S. negotiator said Tuesday
Washington is prepared to give up its bases in the Philippines but
wants a final decision delayed until the next century and voted on
by the Filipino people.
   Chief U.S. negotiator Richard Armitage made the statement during
the opening session of talks here on the future of the U.S.-run
military facilities.
   ``It is clear to me ... that the days of a very large presence
of U.S. sailors and airmen in the Philippines are coming to an
end,'' Armitage said. ``What remains for us to determine is the
rate at which this presence will be reduced and the nature of the
relationship our two governments wish to pursue during and after
this transitional period.''
   ``Let the voters of the 21st century decide whether or not they
believe a continued U.S. presence will be helpful,'' Armitage said.
   A spokesman for the Philippine negotiators, Rafael Alunan,
welcomed Armitage's ``willingness ... to discuss the crafting of a
new relationship between our two countries'' but took exception to
Armitage's call for Filipino voters in the next century to decide
on the American presence.
   ``This matter is not to be decided in the 21st century,'' Alunan
said. ``The time for decision is now.''
   The lease on the U.S. bases expires in September 1991. Any
extension of the American presence after that must be approved by
the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases is strong, and
also by a national referendum if ordered by the Philippines
Congress.
   Analysts say most Filipinos would vote for the U.S. bases to
remain because of their economic benefits.
   The current talks are a continuation of negotiations that began
in May on the future of Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and
four smaller U.S. facilities.
   U.S. officials previously stated U.S. troops would remain in the
Philippines only as long as they are wanted. But on Monday, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Washington wants to keep
its bases in the Philippines.
   Armitage's statement marked the first time a U.S. official had
publicly raised the possibility of Washington's readiness to give
up the bases. He did not propose a timetable for removing the
40,000 troops, Defense Department civilians and military
dependents. U.S. sources said Washington hopes for continued access
to the facilities, perhaps on a commercial basis, after
relinquishing formal control.
   The United States has strongly supported President Corazon
Aquino's administration since 1986 when a civilian-military
uprising ended the 20-year rule of the late President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   In December, U.S. jets flew air cover for government forces
during an unsuccessful bid by military rebels to oust Mrs. Aquino.
American troops from the bases also provided help for the
government during a July earthquake that killed nearly 1,700
people.
   But opponents believe the bases infringe on national sovereignty
and represent a vestige of American colonial rule, which ended with
independence in 1946. U.S. forces have been in the Philippines
since the Americans captured the islands from Spain in 1898, except
for a period of Japanese occupation during World War II.
   Mrs. Aquino said Monday her government wants to maintain close
ties with Washington but that the end of the Cold War and absence
of any external threat to the Philippines made the bases less
important.
   Mrs. Aquino said a government committee was drafting plans to
convert the bases into civilian use, including a commercial airport
at Clark and a ship repair facility at Subic.
   Meanwhile, Communist rebels claimed responsibility for a bombing
late Monday at a Voice of America station 60 miles north of Manila.
The insurgents said the bombing was to protest continued U.S.
``domination'' of this former colony. There were no injuries, and
U.S. officials said damage was slight.
   Last May, Communist rebels killed two American airmen near Clark
on the eve of talks on the bases. American troops and their
families have been restricted to base to prevent possible attacks
during the current negotiations.
