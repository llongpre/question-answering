   Every Lebanese president has been able to
count on one thing _ trouble, and plenty of it.
   Each of the eight presidents since independence from France in
1943 has been plagued by violence.
   Now, after 13 months without a president, Parliament is trying
to approve a peace agreement aimed at ending the 14-year-old
sectarian civil war and elect a new head of state under its terms.
   Under an unwritten covenant accepted in 1943, when Lebanon
gained independence from France, presidents have been Christians,
prime ministers Sunni Moslems and Parliament speakers Shiite Moslem.
   The first president was Bishara Khoury, a French-educated lawyer
and leader of the Christian-Moslem national resistance against the
French, who had governed under a League of Nations mandate since
1920.
   He was in a French prison in southeast Lebanon _ Rachaya Castle,
built by Crusaders _ when Parliament elected him on Sept. 21, 1943,
and was driven from his cell to the presidential palace in Beirut.
   Five years later, Parliament approved a new constitution under
which he was elected for a second term, of six years.
   In 1950, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party staged an armed
revolt aimed at making Lebanon part of a ``greater Syria.'' The
leftist party advocates union of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, pre-1948
Palestine, Iraq, Kuwait and Cyprus.
   Khoury and his Sunni prime minister, Riyad Solh, suppressed the
revolt in two weeks and party leader Antoine Saadeh was executed. A
year later, three members of the party assassinated Solh while he
was visiting Jordan.
   In 1952, Khoury sought to amend the constitution so he could
serve another term, but was unsuccessful and relinquished power to
a transitional military government under Gen. Fuad Chehab, the army
commander.
   Parliament elected Camille Chamoun, a former ambassador to the
United Nations, as president Sept. 22, 1952.
   Chamoun faced a Moslem revolt in 1958 inspired by the radical
teachings of Gamal Abdul Nasser, then Egypt's leader. He asked for
U.S. help and President Eisenhower sent 10,000 Marines.
   During a long political career, Chamoun survived at least four
attempted assassinations. He died of natural causes in 1988, as had
Khoury in 1962.
   Chehab, still army commander, was elected by Parliament
unanimously to succeed Chamoun. In 1959, his powerful military
intelligence branch ruthlessly crushed a New Year's Eve coup
attempt by army officers who belonged to the Syrian Social
Nationalist Party.
   He was followed in 1964 by his protege Charles Helou, a lawyer,
during whose term Yasser Arafat's Palestinian guerrillas built
their power base in Lebanon.
   That led to the first major Israeli attack on Beirut.
Helicopter-borne paratroopers landed at the airport and blew up 10
jetliners of Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, in
1968.
   In 1969, the Lebanese army fought Arafat's guerrillas in south
Beirut. Nasser of Egypt intervened on behalf of Arafat and the
guerrilla presence in Lebanon was secured.
   Suleiman Franjieh, a Maronite Catholic warlord and close friend
of Syrian President Hafez Assad, succeeded Helou in 1972. His term
was marked by clashes between Christians and Palestinians that
started the civil war in April 1975.
   Franjieh asked for Syrian military intervention in 1976 to keep
the Palestinians and their leftist and Moslem allies from
overwhelming the Christians.
   Syria now has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon and their presence has
frustrated many efforts to end a civil war that has cost more than
150,000 lives.
   Artillery shells were falling around Parliament when it chose
Syrian-backed Elias Sarkis, director of the central bank, was
elected with Syrian backing to succeed Franjien. During his term,
the Israelis invaded in 1978 and 1982.
   His successor was Bashir Gemayel, 34, who had Israeli support
and commanded the main Christian militia. He was assassinated Sept.
14, 1982, a week before the inauguration.
   Parliament unanimously elected his elder brother, Amin, who
signed a coexistence treaty with Israel in April 1983 but tore it
up a year later under Syrian pressure.
   Gemayel's term saw the beginning of terrorism by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslems. Suicide truck bombers killed 241 American
servicemen and 58 French paratroopers, part of a multnational
peacekeeping force, on Oct. 23, 1983.
   On Sept. 22, 1988, Gemayel stepped down after naming Gen. Michel
Aoun as head of a caretaker Christian administration when
Parliament could not agree on a successor.
   Moslems formed a rival government led by Salim Hoss, the prime
minister under Gemayel.
