   Pipe bombs exploded Monday at a Bank
of Boston branch and a U.S. Army recruiting office prior to a Senate
hearing on the island's future political relationship with the
United States.
   Police said no one was injured and damage was slight in the
pre-dawn blasts in Bayamon, about 15 miles southwest of San Juan.
   Similar explosions, with no injuries and minor damage, occurred
Friday at a U.S. Customs office in the southern city of Ponce and
Sunday at a Chase Manhattan bank branch in the north-central city of
Caguas.
   Los Macheteros, a militant pro-independence group that has been
relatively inactive in recent years, claimed responsibility for
Monday's bombings.
   In a letter delivered to The Associated Press in San Juan, the
group said it was protesting the ``farcical hearings'' being held by
a Senate committee here on a plebiscite planned for 1991 that will
allow Puerto Ricans to vote on their future relationship with the
United States.
   The group also cited the jailing of Macheteros members in
connection with the $7 million robbery of a Wells Fargo depot in
Hartford, Conn., in 1983.
   On Thursday, a federal court in Hartford sentenced a Macheteros
member, Juan Segarra Palmer, to 65 years in prison and fined him
$500,000 for his part in the robbery. He and three other people were
convicted in April.
   Nine others accused of the robbery, including alleged Macheteros
leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios, are awaiting trial.
   The letter said the violence would continue until the United
States ended its military, political and economic presence in Puerto
Rico.
   The FBI said it was investigating the letter, which bore the
star-and-machete logo of the Macheteros' ``Ejercito Popular
Boricua,'' or People's Army of Borinquen. Los Macheteros is Spanish
for The Machete Wielders, and Borinquen is the Indian name for
Puerto Rico.
   The explosions Monday occurred within an hour of each other, said
police spokeswoman Maria del Pilar Bon. She said one bomb slightly
damaged the bank building's facade and shattered windows of a nearby
bus terminal. The other blast shattered windows of the recruiting
office.
   The U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held
hearings in San Juan on Friday, Saturday and Monday on the proposed
plebiscite on whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. commonwealth,
become the 51st U.S. state or seek independence.
   The Caribbean island of 3.2 million mostly Spanish-speaking
people has been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952.
   It will be the first vote on Puerto Rico's political status since
1967, when 67 percent voted to remain a U.S. commonwealth, 32
percent for statehood and less than 1 percent for independence.
Puerto Rico's statehood and independence parties did not actively
participate in that vote.
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who presided at the Senate
hearings, said at the close of Monday's session that the plebiscite
would be ``fundamentally different'' because the three status
options would be precisely defined and the vote would be binding on
Congress.
   Under commonwealth, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and eligible
for federal benefits, but they cannot vote for president. The island
received $6.5 billion in federal money in 1988.
   The committee's next round of hearings is scheduled for July
12-14 to hear the Bush administration's views on the plebiscite.
President Bush has said he favors statehood.
