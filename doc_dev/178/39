   More than a year after Pan Am Flight 103
blew up over Lockerbie, police officials from that Scottish town
came to the United States to brief relatives of the bombing's
victims on Saturday.
   About 130 people showed up at the St. Charles Hotel in this town
about 30 miles south of Albany to hear Chief Constable George Esson
of Lockerbie give details of his department's investigation.
   ``Better late than never,'' said Bert Ammerman, president of
Victims of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The group Ammerman heads is made up of relatives of the 259
people killed when a bomb smuggled aboard Flight 103 exploded over
Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. Eleven more people were killed on the
ground as debris from the exploded jet rained down on the Scottish
village.
   Esson said he and two other investigators traveled to the United
States because Ammerman, a resident of River Vale, N.J., requested
that they inform families individually in a way the U.S. government
had seemed unwilling to do.
   Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 came together after the crash in
part because the families were frustrated by the lack of
information coming from their own government.
   ``We've not only lost loved ones, but the love of our country
and the feeling that our country would be there for us,'' said Bill
Monetti of Chatham, N.J., whose nephew, Rick Monetti, was killed in
the crash.
   ``We have a government that would like this to be an invisible
episode,'' said Georgia Nucci of Hudson, who lost her son Chris
Jones.
   However, many family members who showed up said they were
encouraged that agents from the FBI and a member of the
Presidential Commission on Security, Aviation and Terrorism showed
up at the briefing.
   Ammerman, whose brother Tom was killed in the bombing, said he
would like to see U.S. law enforcement agencies act more like their
counterparts in Scotland.
   ``Today's meeting was a major step forward in having appropriate
agencies extending themselves to the families,'' he said.
   Informational packets were handed out to the families at a
closed-door briefing Saturday morning. The contents of the packets
were not revealed, but Esson said that catalogues were included
listing items recovered at the crash site that are still unclaimed.
   About 15 percent of the personal effects of the victims is still
in storage in Lockerbie, Esson said.
   Nucci said the closed-door meeting also featured videos showing
a reconstruction of the bombed out portion of the plane and the
memorial service held last Dec. 21 in Lockerbie to mark the
one-year anniversary of the crash.
   A presidential commission has been investigating the disaster
since last August. Their report is tentatively due on May 1.
