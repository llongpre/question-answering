   A boiler pipe ruptured Tuesday on the USS
Iwo Jima, spewing out super-heated steam that killed 10 sailors.
   The accident aboard the amphibious assault ship and the death of
a Marine when his jeep overturned in Saudi Arabia boosted the
number of U.S. military deaths to 43 during the nearly 3-month-old
Operation Desert Shield.
   ``Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who
have departed us,'' said the Iwo Jima's commander, Capt. Michael
O'Hearn.
   The accident was the worst for the Navy in the U.S.-led air,
land and sea mobilization that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait. In the only other Navy fatality during Operation Desert
Shield, a sailor was electrocuted in August aboard the USS
Antietam.
   The Iwo Jima, part of the amphibious task force and U.S. naval
armada supporting Operation Desert Shield, left Bahrain an hour
before the 8:15 a.m. accident.
   ``It was only a couple of miles from the pier when the accident
occurred,'' said Lt. Kevin Wensing, a spokesman for Command Naval
Forces, Central Command.
   Wensing, who visited the ship after it returned to port, spoke
of the ``heroism'' of a well-trained crew who quickly ``secured the
(ship's) two boilers, anchored the ship, evacuated the injured
after their condition was stabilized, and collected the remains of
the dead.''
   He said because the boilers were shut off, and although the
vessel had emergency diesel generators for backup, it was towed
back to port with the help of Bahraini tugs.
   He described the mood of the rest of the 685-man crew and 1,100
Marines aboard as ``somber but very determined.''
   Six sailors died immediately after the accident. The Iwo Jima,
which played a major role in evacuating the 241 Marines killed by a
suicide bomber in Beirut in 1983, used its own helicopters to
transport four injured sailors to the hospital ship USS Comfort.
   Two of the injured died aboard the hospital ship, the Navy said.
The last two survivors were reported in very serious condition, and
late Tuesday afternoon the Pentagon in Washington confirmed they
also had died.
   Identities of eight of the killed were released by the Navy's
Atlantic Fleet. Two names were withheld pending notification of
next of kin. The Iwo Jima is based in Norfolk, Va.
   -David A. Gilliland, 21, Warrensburg, Mo.
   -Mark E. Hutchison, 27, Elkins, W. Va.
   -Daniel Lupatsky, 22, Centralia, Pa.
   -Daniel C. McKinsey, 21, Hanover, Pa.
   -Fred R. Parker Jr., 24, Reidsville, N.C.
   -James A. Smith Jr., 22, Somerville, Tenn.
   -John M. Snyder, 25, Milltown, N.J.
   -Robert L. Volden, 28, Rego Park, N.Y.
   The Marine who died, identified as 1st Lt. Michael N. Monroe,
27, of Auburn, Wash., was with three others from the 1st Battalion,
3rd Marines when their jeep overturned and went down a 20-foot
embankment, a military statement said. His companions were in
stable condition.
   In a related development, officials said three American sailors
were injured when their pickup truck was hit Monday by two
.50-caliber machine-gun rounds fired accidentally by a Marine
sentry.
   The accidental gunfire occurred as the sailors approached the
entrance to a Marine Corps facility. One sailor was hit by a bullet
in the shoulder and chest, the second was injured by glass shards
and the third suffered a concussion, a military statement said.
