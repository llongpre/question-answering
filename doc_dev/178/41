   Lebanon's political mob war has spared no
one.
   Leaders from all major Moslem and Chrisiian groups in the bloody
15-year power struggle have been assassinated by bullets or bombs.
   The latest victim, Christian leader Dany Chamoun, was killed
Sunday when five gunmen burst into his Beirut apartment. The five
uniformed gunmen, who used silencer-equipped pistols, also murdered
his wife and two small sons.
   The slayings were branded by Christian and Moslem leaders alike
as an attempt to block a plan to end the civil war, which has
primarily pitted Moslems against Christians.
   Chamoun, a Maronite Catholic and the son of late President
Camille Chamoun, was one of the most outspoken critics of President
Elias Hrawi and Syria's military presence in Lebanon.
   He also was at odds with Christian warlord Samir Geagea, whose
Lebanese Forces militia fought a four-month war with Gen. Michel
Aoun's troops early this year for mastery of the Christian
hinterland.
   Chamoun was a top supporter of Aoun, who took refuge in the
French Embassy a week ago after being routed by government and
Syrian troups. France has granted him asylum, but the government
insists he stay and stand trial for alleged crimes.
   Chamoun's father, Camille, died a natural death in August 1987.
But in 1980 and 1987, he narrowly escaped assassination when
remote-controlled bombs exploded near his car, wounding him both
times.
   On June 13, 1978, Christian militiamen loyal to Bashir Gemayel
murdered Tony Franjieh, son and political heir of Suleiman
Franjieh, president of Lebanon from 1970 to 1976.
   Franjieh's wife and three-year-old daughter were also killed.
   Gemayel later admitted that his men were involved - but said
they had no authorization to kill Franjieh, who led a rival
militia.
   Four years later, Gemayel was slain at age 34. Three weeks after
being elected president on Aug. 23, 1982, he was killed in an
explosion at the headquarters of his Phalange Party, the leading
Maronite Christian political grouping.
   Rene Mouawad, head of an important Christian clan in northeast
Lebanon, did not even last as long as Gemayel as president.
   On Nov. 22, 1989, just 17 days after his election, a
remote-control bomb killed Mouawad. He was succeeded by Hrawi, who
is seeking to implement an Arab League-brokered peace plan.
   The most important surviving Christian militia leader, Geagea,
has survived several assassination attempts.
   Moslem factions have also seen their top chiefs murdered.
   Prime Minister Rashid Karami, the most prominent Sunni Moslem
leader in Lebanon, was killed June 1, 1987, when a bomb exploded
aboard an army helicopter in which he was a passenger.
   The current prime minister, Salim Hoss, has tasted the threat of
assassination.
   Hoss, a prominent Sunni Moslem leader, was education minister in
1984 when a bomb exploded as he drove to a mosque, wounding him
with glass and shrapnel.
   Lebanon's largest religious group, the Shiite Moslems, lost
their leader Musa Sadr. He disappeared in 1978 while on a trip to
Libya, whose leader Moammar Gadhafi has backed the Sunnis. Sadr is
presumed to have been murdered.
   Kamal Jumblatt, a prominent left-wing political leader and chief
of Lebanon's Druse sect, which fields one of the toughest militias,
was machine-gunned to death at a road ambush in March 1977.
   His son and successor, Walid Jumblatt, survives uneasily. In
June 1987, he asked an aide to open a gift that appeared to be a
case containing a pen. It exploded, blowing the aide's hands off.
   Prominent foreigners have also fallen in the spate of
assassinations.
   In June 1976, kidnappers took U.S. Ambassador Francis E. Meloy
and his economic counselor, Robert O. Waring, from their limousine.
Their bullet-riddled bodies were recovered later at a beach in
Moslem west Beirut.
   Four French Embassy staffers have been killed since 1981,
including Ambassador Louis Delamar when three gunmen fired on him
on Sept. 4, 1981, just outside his home.
   Malcolm Kerr, president of American University of Beirut, was
shot to death in a hallway outside his office in January 1984.
   On Oct. 23, 1983, a suicide truck-bomber blew up the
headquarters of the French contingent of the multinational
peacekeeping force in Beirut, killing 58 French soldiers.
   A similar bombing was carried out at the same time against the
force's U.S. Marine contingent, killing 241 Americans. The bombings
were claimed by the pro-Iranian Shiite extremist group called
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
   An estimated 150,000 people have died in Lebanon's civil war.
