   The United States acknowledged today
that the days of a large U.S. military presence in the Philippines
are numbered, and asked for time to phase out its oldest and
largest bases abroad.
   ``It is clear to me ... that the days of a very large presence
of U.S. sailors and airmen in the Philippines are coming to an
end,'' chief American negotiator Richard Armitage told the opening
session of talks on the bases' future.
   ``What remains for us to determine is the rate at which this
presence will be reduced and the nature of the relationship our two
governments wish to pursue during and after this transitional
period.''
   It was the first time a U.S. official had publicly raised the
possibility that Washington is prepared to give up the six bases.
   The talks continue negotiations begun in May on the future of
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval base and four smaller
installations. Their lease expires in September 1991, and
Philippine opposition to the installations is growing.
   On Monday, a bomb exploded at a Voice of America relay station
60 miles north of Manila, and Communist rebels claimed
responsibility in a statement, saying they were protesting U.S.
``domination'' of the Philippines.
   There were no injuries, and U.S. officials said damage was
slight.
   The talks are being held in the Central Bank building, guarded
by more than 1,500 police and soldiers. About 1,000 leftist workers
and students rallied near the bank today to protest the bases but
dispersed peacefully after police refused to allow them to march to
the site.
   At least 17 people were arrested and 14 injured during
anti-bases protets in Manila on Monday.
   U.S. diplomats have said in the past that U.S. troops will
remain in the Philippines only as long as they are wanted.
   On Monday, however, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said Washington wants to keep its bases in the Philippines.
   In his comments today, Armitage did not propose a timetable for
removing the 40,000 troops, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents. But he hinted that the process could extend
until the end of the century.
   He said the U.S. and Philippine military, Filipino base workers
and other nations in the region need time to adjust to the possible
closing of the bases.
   ``Let the voters of the 21st Century decide whether or not they
believe a continued U.S. presence will be helpful,'' Armitage said.
   Rafael Alunan, spokesman for the Philippine negotiators, said
Manila welcomed Armitage's ``willingness ... to discuss the
crafting of a new relationship between our two countries.''
   But he took exception to Armitage's call for voters of the next
century to decide on the American presence. ``This matter is not to
be decided in the 21st century,'' Alunan said. ``The time for
decision is now.''
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said Friday that U.S.
officials were considering a 10-year phaseout.
   Last month, Manila newspapers quoted unidentified sources as
saying the Philippines was considering allowing the Americans to
remain in Subic for up to 10 years if they returned Clark and the
other installations in 1991.
   Opponents believe the bases infringe on national sovereignty and
represent a vestige of American colonial rule, which ended with
independence in 1946. U.S. forces have been in the Philippines
since the Americans captured the islands from Spain in 1898.
   During a nationally televised speech Monday, President Corazon
Aquino said her government wants to maintain close ties with
Washington. But she said the end of the Cold War and absence of any
external threat to the Philippines made the bases less important.
   ``It is now necessary for our government to work with the United
States for arrangements regarding the orderly withdrawal of their
forces from our country,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   She noted that a government committee is drafting plans to
convert the bases into civilian use, including a commercial airport
at Clark and a ship repair facility at Subic.
   The United States has strongly supported the Aquino
administration since a 1986 revolution ended the 20-year rule of
the late President Ferdinand Marcos, a longtime U.S. ally.
   In December, U.S. jets from Clark flew air cover for government
forces during an unsuccessful bid by military rebels to oust Mrs.
Aquino.
   American troops from the bases also provided help for the
government during a July earthquake that killed nearly 1,700
people.
