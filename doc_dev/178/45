   Soldiers held their children tight, military wives shopped with
tears in their eyes and at least one bride was left at the altar as
U.S. troops were mobilized to help Saudi Arabia defend a possible
attack by Iraq.
   Pfc. Mark Ohmer, a member of Fort Bragg's 82nd Airborne
Division's chemical unit, was to marry Angela Nelson, 19, on
Saturday in suburban Detroit. The $6,000 wedding was postponed when
he was called back to the North Carolina base to prepare to leave
for Saudi Arabia.
   ``It's scary _ not just for my wedding, but for the country and
for all the soldiers who might have to go over there and fight,''
Nelson said. ``It happened so fast. I'm so upset.''
   In North Carolina, convenience store clerks said brisk sales of
chewing tobacco, batteries and insect repellent to somber soldiers
and their wives were sure signs Fort Bragg soldiers were ready to
go.
   ``A lot of fathers are coming in with their kids, holding them
real tight'' and many wives are in tears as they make their
purchases, said Effie Parsons, a clerk at the Short Stop
convenience store near the base.
   ``They are definitely going. There is no doubt in my mind that
this is another war,'' said Ms. Parsons, 23.
   President Bush ordered U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia to repel a
potential Iraqi attack. Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait last week.
   ``At my direction, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, as
well as key units of the United States Air Force, are arriving
today to take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia,'' Bush said
today. ``I took this action to assist the Saudi Arabian government
in the defense of its homeland.''
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
besides that division from Fort Bragg, they expected deployment of
the 24th Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. and the 101st
Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky. Elements of those three
units would be deployed with the 18th Airborne Corps, a control
unit at Fort Bragg that directs the combat divisions, the sources
said.
   Bush provided no estimate of the number of U.S. troops involved
in the deployment. But government sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said at least 5,000 ground troops were involved, along
with 140 sophisticated fighters and bombers.
   About 2,000 troops temporarily stationed at Fort Chaffee, Ark.,
for training were headed back to their home base at Fort Bragg
``because of the activities in Iraq,'' said base spokesman Cecil
Green.
   A task force of the 82nd Airborne Division had been
participating in a mock war scheduled to end Sunday, but the
exercise was cut short, he said.
   At Fort Campbell, a base spokesman said today that the 101st
Airborne had not been deployed to Saudi Arabia, but soldiers were
tensely awaiting word.
   ``I'm sure everybody that had access to a TV was watching
closely, or if they did not, listening to the radio,'' said public
affairs officer Bill Harralson.
   Soldiers on leave from the 24th Infantry Division at Fort
Stewart were summoned back Tuesday, but base officials refused to
say whether they were being sent to the Middle East.
   Spec. 4 Norman Aimes, 24, part of the infantry division, said he
was called back from leave in Utah.
   ``They called and said there is a 99 percent chance that we are
going,'' Aimes said Tuesday.
   Pentagon sources said today that a second Navy cruiser was added
to the Persian Gulf, bringing to nine the number of U.S. ships in
the strategic water way.
   The sources said the battleship Wisconsin, carrying cruise
missiles, was deployed Tuesday night and that President Bush
planned to send F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft. Already deployed
were five AWACs reconnaisance planes, government officials said.
   Navy and government officials downplayed the possibility of a
blockade or military involvement for sailors aboard the USS
Saratoga, which set out Tuesday from the Mayport Naval Station near
Jacksonville, Fla.
   But the possibility of action was on the minds of many family
members as the huge aircraft carrier set out.
   ``I hope we get involved. I hope so. Maybe we can straighten out
the situation out there. Maybe they need us to go in and kick
butt,'' said Wendy Hunter, holding her 8-month-old son, Jonathan.
   Her husband, Paul, is aboard the Saratoga, which was joined by a
small support flotilla that included the guided missile cruiser
Philippine Sea, the destroyers Spruance and Sampson, and the
frigate Elmer Montgomery.
   In Washington state, four Navy squadrons with more than 950 men
from Whidbey Island Naval Air Station were aboard the three
aircraft carriers in or heading for the gulf, said base spokesman
Howard Thomas.
