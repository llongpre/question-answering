   Here is a chronology of Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war:
   
   April 13, 1975 - Following political and sectarian rivalry that
has simmered since independence from France in 1943, civil war
breaks out.
   April 12, 1976 - Syria, alarmed at Palestinian-leftist gains,
sends in troops to support the Christians. The Arab League endorses
the move in June with a peacekeeping mandate.
   July 1, 1978 - Syrian troops attack Christians in the worst
fighting in two years. At least 200 people are killed.
   April 29, 1981 - Syria moves missiles into Lebanon in response
to increased clashes with Israel, whose forces have intervened in
fighting between Syrians and Christians.
   June 6, 1982 - Israel invades Lebanon, bombing Syrian missile
batteries and besieging Moslem west Beirut, trapping the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Aug. 4, 1982 - Iran sends its Revolutionary Guards to Lebanon to
fight the Israelis as they tighten their siege of west Beirut. The
Iranian force reaches 3,000 men and trains Shiite Moslem fighters.
   Aug. 30, 1982 - PLO chief Yasser Arafat and his guerrillas
evacuate Beirut under a truce plan supervised by U.S., French and
other forces, who withdraw Sept. 10.
   Sept. 14, 1982 - President-elect Bashir Gemayel, a pro-Israeli
Maronite Catholic, is assassinated in a bombing. Israelis storm
into west Beirut.
   Sept. 16, 1982 - Christian militiamen massacre hundreds of
Palestinian civilians in Beirut's Shabra and Chatilla refugee
camps, an area under Israeli control. Lebanese leaders ask for
multinational peacekeepers to return and they are gradually drawn
into civil war.
   April 18, 1983 - The U.S. Embassy in Beirut is hit by a Shiite
suicide bomber, killing 63.
   Oct. 23, 1983 - Suicide truck bomb attacks by pro-Iranian
Shiites on U.S. and French bases kill 241 U.S. servicemen and 58
French paratroopers.
   Feb. 6, 1984 - Moslem and leftist militias seize control of west
Beirut, forcing out Christian army units. Rival militias battle
each other. Hundreds of people are killed.
   June 10, 1985 - The Israeli army completes its withdrawal from
Lebanon, but occupies a border strip patrolled by allied Christian
militiamen.
   Feb. 22, 1987 - Syrian troops deploy in west Beirut, ending
three years of militia anarchy during which dozens of foreigners
are kidnapped.
   Sept. 22, 1988 - President Amin Gemayel's six-year term ends
with Parliament unable to elect a successor. He appoints army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun interim prime minister. The Moslems
reject Aoun and remain loyal to acting prime minister Salim Hoss,
who governed under Gemayel.
   March 8, 1989 - Aoun, vowing to crush the militias, blockades
their illegal ports. Syrian-backed Moslems blockade the Christian
enclave, triggering six months of artillery battles that kill more
than 900 people. Aoun declares a ``war of liberation'' against
Syria.
   Sept. 22, 1989 - An Arab League-brokered cease-fire takes hold
and Lebanon's lawmakers meet in Taif, Saudi Arabia, seeking a peace
settlement.
   Oct. 24, 1989 - Legislators endorse the Arab League peace plan,
which cuts Maronite power and gives Moslems a greater say in
government.
   Nov. 5, 1989 - Parliament formally approves the Taif agreement.
   Nov. 24, 1989 - Elias Hrawi is elected president to implement
the Taif accord. Aoun refuses to recognize Hrawi or the accord.
   Jan. 30, 1990 - Aoun attacks the Lebanese Forces militia under
Samir Geagea, seeking control of the Christian enclave. More than
1,000 people, mostly civilians, are killed.
   July 16 - Fighting erupts in south Lebanon between rival Shiite
militias. More than 200 are killed before a mid-August cease-fire.
   Sept. 1 - Hrawi signs political reforms approved by Parliament
and warns that he'll move against Aoun if he continues his
defiance. Aoun rejects the reforms.
   Sept. 30 - Hrawi's predominantly Moslem army blockades Aoun's
enclave.
   Oct. 13 - Syrian and Lebanese government forces attack Aoun's
enclave, forcing him to surrender and seek asylum in the French
Embassy.
