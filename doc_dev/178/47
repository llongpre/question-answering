<P>
President Bush, marking the 20th anniversary of man's first lunar landing, 
proposed today that the United States establish a base on the moon in the 21st 
Century to be followed by a manned mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Bush offered no price tag for the costly program he promised would lead "back 
to the moon, back to the future, and this time back to stay." 
</P>
<P>
"Then a journey into tomorrow," he said. "A journey to another planet, a manned 
mission to Mars." The distance between Mars and Earth varies from 48.7 million 
miles and 248 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
Bush offered few details beyond his broad goals, and said he was leaving it to 
Vice President Dan Quayle, the National Space Council and NASA to come up with 
"realistic timetables." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Deadline for Mars Trip 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Richard Truly, administrator of NASA, said the President has asked that 
the lunar station be established in the first decade of the next century. He 
said no deadline has been set for the Mars mission. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony from the steps of the National Air and Space Museum, the 
President reasserted the goal of establishing Space Station Freedom in the 
1990s, the necessary first step for the moon and Mars projects. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was flanked on the outdoor museum stage by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, 
the two men who planted their footsteps on the moon on July 20, 1969, and 
Michael Collins, the third member of the Apollo 11 crew. 
</P>
<P>
"America should never stop seeking distant frontiers," Bush said. "We dream of 
distant shores we've not yet seen. . . . A dream to be realized by future 
generations must begin with this generation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have rested on our Apollo laurels long enough. It's time to get moving 
again," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush drew Democratic support for his vision, but the decision to provide no 
budget or deadline prompted criticism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One Small Step' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dennis E. Eckart (D-Ohio) said Bush was "calling for one great leap for 
mankind" but not even providing the money for "one small step," using a 
take-off of Armstrong's first words from the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
"The party of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson applauds the decision of 
President Bush to recommit America to space exploration," said Rep. Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.), the House majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
"But the real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can marshal the 
words but the resources to restore America's preeminence in space," Gephardt 
said. "In sum, Mr. President, there's no such thing as a free launch." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt said that under Democratic presidents of the '60s, the NASA budget 
approached 4% of the U.S. budget. Republican Presidents of the '80s have 
proposed less than 1%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$30-Billion Start-Up Cost 
</P>
<P>
Truly, in a press briefing at the White House, noted that Congress is already 
balking at the start-up costs for the $30-billion space station. The station is 
the essential for the moon project and the trip to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an irony that at the time we find this sort of leadership and vision for 
America's future, that at the same time, this very day up on the Hill, we are 
in fact fighting very hard for the very life of Space Station Freedom and other 
things in the civil space program," he said.
