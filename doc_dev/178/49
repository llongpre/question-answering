   Business owners and
residents of St. Croix on Saturday protested President Bush's plan
to withdraw 1,100 federal troops that were sent to the island to
quell looting after Hurricane Hugo hit.
   The United Concerned Citizens of St. Croix, formed last week to
protest the plan, said it joined the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce
and the Board of Realtors to lobby the White House and Pentagon
urging Bush to rescind the order.
   The Defense Department announced Thursday troops would all be
withdrawn within 20 days. The soldiers, mostly military police,
arrived Sept. 21 to restore order, four days after Hugo had passed
and most stores were looted.
   In a full-page ad in the daily St. Croix Avis on Saturday, the
group urged residents to phone the White House and Pentagon to tell
authorities ``that we Crucians appreciate and want continued
military presence.''
   ``We have no electricity and telephones and we want to be safe
on the island,'' the ad said.
   The group, which represents shop owners and residents, said that
by Friday night more than 300 calls had been made to the Pentagon
and the White House pleading for the troops to stay.
   Chamber of Commerce President Jan Hanley on Friday accused Gov.
Alexander Farrelly of reneging on his promise to not request the
troop withdrawal until power and telephones were restored.
   The St. Croix Board of Realtors in its annual meeting Friday
also denounced the withdrawal order and demanded the troops stay
until vital services are restored.
   A spokesman for the 16th Brigade Batallion Command, one of the
units dispatched to St. Croix, said Friday night that a small
contingent of the National Guard would arrive Nov. 13 to replace
the federal troops.
   Hugo destroyed most homes and caused more than $500 million in
damage to St. Croix, an island of 50,000. It killed an estimated 56
people in the Caribbean and 29 on the U.S. mainland.
