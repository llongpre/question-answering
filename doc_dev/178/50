   Today is Saturday, May 14, the 135th day of 1988. There are 231
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Forty years ago, on May 14, 1948, the independent state of
Israel was proclaimed in Tel Aviv as British rule in Palestine came
to an end. The United States immediately recognized the new Jewish
state. (Israel celebrated the 40th anniversary on April 21 because
the date was determined by the lunar calendar.)
   On this date:
   In 1643, Louis XIV became King of France at age four upon the
death of his father, Louis XIII.
   In 1787, delegates began gathering in Philadelphia for a
convention to draw up the U.S. Constitution.
   In 1796, English physician Edward Jenner administered the first
vaccination against smallpox to an 8-year-old boy.
   In 1804, the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore the Louisiana
Territory left St. Louis.
   In 1904, the first Olympic games to be held in the United States
opened in St. Louis.
   In 1942, the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps was established.
   In 1955, representatives from eight Communist bloc countries,
including the Soviet Union, signed the Warsaw Pact in Poland.
   In 1973, the United States launched Skylab I, its first manned
space station.
   In 1975, U.S. forces raided the Cambodian island of Koh Tang and
recaptured the American merchant ship Mayaguez. All 40 crew members
were released safely by Cambodia, but some 40 U.S. servicemen were
killed in the military operation.
   Ten years ago: William P. Lear, the inventor and industrialist
who pioneered development of the automatic pilot for aircraft, car
radios, the eight-track audio cartridge and the corporate jet that
bears his name, died in Reno, Nevada, at age 75.
   Five years ago: Lebanese President Amin Gemayel's cabinet voted
unanimously to approve a U.S.-sponsored troop withdrawal agreement
with Israel, despite Syrian rejection of the pact.
   One year ago: The Commerce Department reported that the U.S.
trade deficit had narrowed in March to $13.6 billion.
   Today's birthdays: Opera singer Patrice Munsel is 63. Movie
producer George Lucas (``Star Wars'') is 44. Actress Francesca
Annis is 44. Actress Season Hubley is 37. Rock artist David Byrne
is 36.
   Thought for today: ``In Israel, in order to be a realist, you
must believe in miracles.'' _ David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first
prime minister (1886-1973).
