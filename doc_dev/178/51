   Today is Wednesday, Sept. 21, the 265th day of 1988. There are
101 days left in the year. This is Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of
Atonement.
   Today's highlight in history:
   In 1938, a devastating hurricane with winds clocked at more than
180 mph struck parts of New York and New England with little
warning, causing widespread damage and claiming more than 600
lives. (The hurricane bears no name because the system for
assigning names to major tropical storms did not go into effect
until 1953.)

his resignation.
