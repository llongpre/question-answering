   Jon Bon Jovi says a rock group can ``lose
touch,'' so he thinks it's great that youths who usually buy Bon
Jovi albums decided which songs would go on the band's latest album.
   ``We brought 50 kids into the studio and we played them
everything,'' Bon Jovi said after the quintet from New Jersey
recorded the LP in Vancouver. ``It was surprisingly helpful because
a couple of the songs wouldn't have made it.
   ``We had another friend of ours in New York give it to his kids
and they took it to kids camp. `Born To Be My Baby' and `Bad
Medicine,' which is the first single, kept coming back (as
favorites). We write it, so we don't know anymore.''
   The group held a news conference Friday at Roseland Ballroom to
announce its upcoming tour, which will start Halloween night in
Dublin, Ireland. The U.S. tour will come later, starting in Hawaii.

   The security firm of Watergate figure G. Gordon
Liddy is going public in a merger that will enable the company to
pay off back taxes and expand its operations in Latin America.
   G. Gordon Liddy and Associates has signed a letter of intent to
merge in a $300,000 deal with Castleton Investors Corp., a Fort
Lauderdale-based investment firm, both companies said Thursday.
Stock will be sold under the Liddy name.
   Liddy's Miami-based security firm grabbed national headlines
after Liddy set up a commando camp in 1986 to train students in
explosives, hand-to-hand combat and hostage negotiations. A trained
group of mercenaries Liddy calls the ``Hurricane Force'' can also
be hired out for hostage-rescue missions.
   Liddy spent five years in prison in connection with the
Watergate break-in, which he supervised.

   Slawek Walesa, the 15-year-old son of
Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, prefers talking about pop
music, pizza and cars to politics.
   The youth, on a two-month U.S. tour, was scheduled to accept the
American Friendship Award here Saturday on his father's behalf from
the American Freedom Foundation.
   The group honored Lech Walesa with the award in 1984, but he was
unable to leave Poland because of political conditions there.
   The award will be given to the younger Walesa during the 40th
national convention of the American Council of Polish Cultural
Clubs.
   Walesa wore a Pepsi T-shirt, sneakers and jeans and carried a
boom box as he arrived at the hotel Friday. Asked about the major
difference between the United States and Poland, he responded
through an interpreter, ``The stores ... there is so much of
everything!''
   Since his arrival in the United States on June 28, Walesa has
met Vice President George Bush and was granted a 30-second Oval
Office chat with President Reagan.

   New York Knicks star Mark Jackson teamed up with
Mayor Edward I. Koch to tell 200 inner city youngsters to take
advantage of sports and education and avoid dope.
   The National Basketball Association rookie of the year played
several games of three-on-one Friday with the 7- to 15-year-olds at
a basketball camp in Queens and showed them some of his dribbling,
passing and shooting tricks.
   The visit was part of a national program to present role models
to youngsters to fight drug use.
   The Queens native, who starred at nearby St. John's University,
told the youngsters that he had taken advantage of opportunities as
a youth and urged them to maintain clean minds and bodies.
   Koch discussed the drug problem and asked if any of the kids
knew anyone who used drugs. Many said they did. He also discussed
the links between AIDS and drugs.

   If at first you don't succeed in
America, try the Soviet Union. That's what singer John Denver did.
   After unsuccessfully seeking to be a passenger on the U.S. space
shuttle, he has asked the Soviet Union for a ride aboard its Mir
space station, an industry magazine reported Friday.
   Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology said Denver had requested
transportation to Mir aboard one of the Soyuz spaceships that
regularly carry crews to and from the orbiting station.
   ``The Soviets responded with two conditions,'' the magazine
said. ``They told Denver they would charge him $10 million for the
ride and that he had to get permission from the U.S. government.
   ``The State Department took its customary cautious approach,
advising Denver it was taking `no position' on the matter _
effectively putting it back into the hands of the Soviets.''
   The magazine quoted an unidentified American official as saying,
``We very carefully did not endorse his going, but at the same time
we can't prevent U.S. citizens from going to exotic places.''
   Denver has been a guest of NASA at several space shuttle
launches and has asked several times over the years for a shuttle
ride, saying he wanted to compose in orbit a song about space.

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor plans physical
therapy and rest at home to ease her back problems before embarking
on a promotional tour for her fragrance line, a publicist says.
   Miss Taylor was released from the hospital Thursday after more
than three weeks of strict bed rest and physical therapy for the
back condition, hospital spokeswoman Mary Miller said.
   Miss Taylor was admitted July 25 to St. John's Hospital in Santa
Monica for a compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra that
produced lower back muscle spasms. She hurt herself last month when
she fell on the set of the film ``Young Toscannini,'' said her
publicist, Chen Sam.
   Miss Taylor has suffered back problems since she fell off a
horse and fractured her spine 30 years ago, Ms. Sam said.
