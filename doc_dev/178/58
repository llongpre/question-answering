   Coretta Scott King, in her annual ``State of the
Dream'' address, urged President-elect Bush on Sunday to hold true
to his call for ``a kinder, gentler nation'' and to impose strict
sanctions against South Africa.
   The widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. made her statements
on the day King would have turned 60. She spoke to an estimated
1,200 people in Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where
King and his father were co-pastors.
   ``We urge President Bush to support comprehensive U.S. economic
sanctions against South Africa,'' Mrs. King said. ``But the U.S.
must also do more by providing education and economic assistance
directly to black South Africans who bear the brunt of suffering in
that troubled land.''
   She listed several issues and urged Bush to ``put behind the
politics of the past'' and address them during his term of office.
Among the issues were affordable housing, a stepped-up war on drugs
and racial violence and the appointment of federal judges ``who are
as tough on discrimination as they are on street crimes.''
   ``I think we ought to take the president-elect at his word and
hold him to his call for a kinder, gentler nation where peace and
justice are in fact a reality,'' Mrs. King said. ``But a kinder,
gentler nation will require kinder, gentler leaders.''
   ``The King Center stands ready to share our skills, resources and
facilities to help expose members of the administration and Congress
to the philosophy and strategy of Kingian non-violence,'' she said.
``So that the kinder, gentler nation can begin to move from rhetoric
to reality.''
   Mrs. King may have delivered her final ``State of the Dream''
address as president of The King Center. On Saturday, she announced
that her son, Dexter Scott King, 27, would assume the center's
presidency April 4 _ the 21st anniversary of King's assassination at
a Memphis hotel.
   Mrs. King said Sunday she decided to leave the presidency because
she ``recognizes that the leadership must be shared with our
children.''
   ``But let me tell you something. I'm still the chief executive
officer and I'm not going anywhere,'' she said.
   Several dignitaries attended Sunday's program, including Lee
Atwater, national chairman of the Republican Party. Atwater praised
King as ``a political meteor who streaked across the night sky'' and
``lit the horizon with a startling brilliance and intensity.''
   ``His work and his memory are an inspiration to me and to
President-elect Bush,'' Atwater said.
   St. Louis Police Capt. Charles Alphin was presented with the
center's first President's Award, and Clara Hale, founder of the
Hale House in New York, received the center's 1989 Humanitarian
Award.
   A national holiday in King's honor is being celebrated Monday.
