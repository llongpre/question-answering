   Today's highlight in history:

   In 1978, John Vorster, prime minister of white-ruled South Africa

Central African Empire, was overthrown in a French-supported coup
while on a visit to Libya.
   Five years ago: A suicide car bomber attacked the U.S. Embassy
annex in north Beirut, killing a dozen people. Pope John Paul II
wrapped up his 12-day tour of Canada in Ottawa, appealing for action
against the nuclear arms race, economic injustice and abortion.
