   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis,
who attempted to use his power as governor of Massachusetts to block
a National Guard training mission in Central America, lost an appeal
Tuesday challenging federal authority over the guard.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-sentence order
affirming a decision by U.S. District Judge Robert Keeton on May 6
that upheld federal supremacy over the guard.
   ``Having examined the briefs of the parties ... and having had
the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the judgment on the basis
stated in the district court's well-reasoned opinion,'' the appeals
court said.
   Dukakis filed suit in January to block the assignment of 13
public relations specialists in the Massachusetts Guard to Honduras
and Panama for two weeks in May because of his opposition to Reagan
administration policies in the region.
   Dukakis has denounced during his presidential campaign the
administration for its ``failed and illegal'' policy of supporting
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. He said sending National Guard troops
to the region was an attempt to intimidate Nicaragua.
   Dukakis, who was campaigning Tuesday in California and Colorado,
had no immediate comment on the decision.
   After Keeton issued his ruling in May, Dukakis appealed but he
did not try to stop the Massachusetts troops from participating in
the road-building exercises.
   Keeton's decision upheld the constitutionality of the Montgomery
Amendment, a 1986 act of Congress that says governors may not
decline such assignments ``because of any objection to the location,
purpose, type or schedule of such activity.''
   The U.S. Justice Department described Dukakis' position as ``a
dagger aimed at the heart of national defense.''
   The Massachusetts' attorney general's office had claimed that the
``Militia Clause'' of the Constitution reserved power to the
governors over training militia.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, joined by Massachusetts and nine
other states, challenged the law last year in U.S. District Court in
St. Paul and lost. That case is now on appeal.
