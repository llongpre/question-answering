   President Bush issued a proclamation Wednesday
asking everybody who lives in the United States to truthfully
answer all questions on the 1990 Census.
   The Census Bureau is mailing out questionnaires March 23 to all
American households in its decennial head-counting exercise.
   Bush quoted Abraham Lincoln as saying, ``If we could just know
where we are and whither we are tending, we could better judge what
to do and how to do it.''
   ``The census helps to provide us with such insight,'' said Bush.
   The Census Bureau has enlisted 425,000 workers to ring
doorbells, canvass householders and even tally the homeless on
big-city streets. The forms by law must be filled out and returned
by April 1, the official ``Census Day.''
   The U.S. population has just passed the 250 million mark,
according to the latest Census estimate.
   There were only 3.9 million Americans in 1790 when U.S. marshals
carried out the first Census under the direction of then-Secretary
of State Thomas Jefferson, Bush noted. This will be the 21st census.
   ``Each decennial census has helped to chart the growth and
change experienced by our vast country during the past 200 years,''
said Bush.
   The primary purpose today, as in 1790, is to fix the state
population totals that determine the number of seats each state
gets in the House of Representatives.
   Bush said it also now serves to help reshape voting districts
for state and local governments, and plays an essential role in
allocating billions of dollars for education, health care, crime
prevention, transportation and other purposes.
   The information will help the government and private sector make
``critical decisions as we prepare to enter the 21st century,''
Bush said.
   ``It is the responsibility and obligation of every person who
usually resides in the United States to take part in the 1990
Census of Population and Housing by truthfully answering all
questions on the census forms applying to him or her and to each
member of the household to which he or she belongs,'' the president
proclaimed.
   Bush also assured the skittish the census results won't be
released in any way ``that will identify or harm any person or
household.''
   That means they cannot be used for tax-collection purposes, by
immigration authorities, for jury service or similar intrusive
purposes.
   The census is expected to cost $2.5 billion, a figure driven up
in part by an expected drop in the number of Americans who respond
by mail. Fewer mail responses means the Census Bureau has to do
more work to contact people.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said, ``The U.S.
taxpayers can save $10 million for every 1 percent of the
population that responds by mail.'' Nearly 81 percent responded by
mail to the 1970 Census and 75 percent in 1980. Census officials
fear only 70 percent will respond by mail this time.
