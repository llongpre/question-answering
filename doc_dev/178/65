   A lawyer for a Cuban exile said Monday he'll
seek to question two former leaders of Chile's secret police who
allegedly ordered the assassination of ex-Chilean ambassador
Orlando Letelier.
   Attorney Paul Goldberger's client, Dionisio Suarez Esquivel, was
ordered Monday by U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson to
stand trial beginning Sept. 10 on charges that he helped carry out
the Letelier killing.
   Suarez was arrested April 11 in St. Petersburg, Fla., after 12
years as a fugitive. He is charged with conspiracy, murdering a
foreign official, two counts of murder and using explosives that
result in death.
   Letelier and an aide, Ronni Moffitt, died when a bomb attached
to the car in which they rode was detonated in Washington on Sept.
21, 1976.
   The Chilean government has refused to extradite the two former
Chilean secret police offials.
   Juan Manuel Contreras Sepulveda and Pedro Espinoza Bravo were
indicted along with Suarez and five other people in 1978. It will
be up to the judge to decide whether to order depositions from
Contreras and Espinoza for the Suarez case.
   A Chilean official did say Saturday that Chile has agreed to pay
compensation to the families of Letelier and Moffitt. But the
announcement by acting Interior Minister Belisario Velasco was not
expected to affect the criminal cases.
   An outspoken critic of the Chilean regime of Augusto Pinochet,
Letelier had been the ambassador to the United States under the
Marxist government of Salvador Allende.
   The government's chief witness against Suarez is expected to be
Michael Townley, a U.S. citizen who worked for the Chilean
intelligence service, DINA.
   In court, Goldberger said U.S. officials had refused to
extradite Townley, who apparently is in the U.S. government's
witness protection program. Townley had been implicated in a murder
case in Argentina involving an exiled Chilean general, Carlos
Pratz. Pratz died in a bomb blast.
   Prosecutors did not comment on Goldberger's assertion that the
U.S. had turned down an Argentine request to turn over Townley, who
admitted planting the bomb in the Letelier killing and served a
40-month prison term.
   Goldberger also represented another defendant in the Letelier
case, Guillermo Novo Sampol. Sampol, now living in the Miami area,
was convicted of perjury. Appearing in court, Novo said he had no
objection to Goldberger representing Suarez. Prosecutors have said
they might call Novo as a witness against Suarez.
   Outside the courtroom, Novo said he is involved in fund raising
for Suarez's legal defense.
   On April 24, the Chilean Suprme Court ordered the reopening of
an investigation in Chile into the Letelier assassination. The
ruling came after a woman named Liliana Walker, a Chilean security
agent, said in newspaper interviews that she had helped in the
preparations for the assassination.
   She said she accompanied another agent, Armando Fernandez
Larios, to Washington in 1976 to helped in the groundwork.
Fernandez left Chile secretly in 1987 and surrendered in the United
States, where he admitted participating in the preparations.
Goldberger said he wants to question Walker as well as the two
former DINA officers.
