   McDonnell Douglas Corp. completed the second step of a top management reorganization by naming Gerald A. Johnston as president. 

   Mr. Johnston, vice president and general manager of McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. in Huntington Beach, Calif., was chosen over a host of higher ranking executives. 
Securities analysts suggested his 20 years of experience in the unit responsible for work in laser technology, space defense weapons and other space-related projects may signal the new management's intention to focus more heavily on those areas of business. 

   Mr. Johnston succeeds John F. McDonnell, son of the company's founder, who recently was named chairman and chief executive officer following the retirement of his cousin, Sanford N. McDonnell. 

   John McDonnell, 49 years old, and Mr. Johnston, 56, are expected to lead the St. Louis-based aerospace and information systems concern into the 21st century. 
They take over at a time when defense cutbacks are squeezing company profits and competition is increasing in two important business areas, the manufacture of commercial aircraft and expendable space launch vehicles. 

   McDonnell Douglas recently has had some major financial setbacks, including loss of a lucrative contract to supply Japan with aircraft fighters to competitor General Dynamics Corp. Also, the company has had to scale back sales estimates for its new long-range jumbo jet, the MD-11. 

   In 1987, the company earned $313 million, or $7.75 a share, compared with $277.5 million, or $6.86 a share, in 1986. 
The 1986 result included a one-time pre-tax gain of $14.6 million and pretax write-offs of $132 million. 

   The company received a big boost in December when it was awarded a $1.9 billion 10-year contract to design and build a major portion of the U.S.'s planned Space Station. 
And, it won a major competition in a joint venture with General Dynamics to make the Advanced Tactical Aircraft, a new carrier-based bomber aircraft, for the Navy. 
The contract has a value of $4.4 billion, a spokesman said. 

   John McDonnell said Mr. Johnston was selected for the No. 2 position for his "exceptional ability" to work with customers and other managers. 
"He (has) a clear understanding of the kinds of changes that will have to be made if McDonnell Douglas is to remain in the forefront of the aerospace and informations systems industries," Mr. McDonnell said. 

   Starting as an associate engineer with the Douglas Aircraft Co. in 1956, Mr. Johnston held a variety of positions, including chief engineer on the Nike X and Spartan missile programs as well as first director of development engineering for McDonnell Douglas Astronautics. 
He became vice president and general manager of the astronautics company in 1986.
