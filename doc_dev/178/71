Chrysler Corp. officials, opening negotiations Friday with its union workers, 
said they want "to explore some kind of employee ownership" in the company and 
dropped hints that Chrysler may want the United Auto Workers Union to choose it 
as a strike target. 
</P>
<P>
At the opening of talks with the UAW, Chrysler's chief negotiator, Vice 
President Tony St. John, presented UAW President Owen Bieber with a road map of 
Detroit. "This is a street map of Detroit, and it leads to Chrysler," St. John 
said in an apparent joke. 
</P>
<P>
But it was also the strongest indication to date that Chrysler might want to be 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler also said it is interested in a plan for union employees to receive 
some form of ownership in the company in return for labor concessions. "We 
would like to explore some form of employee ownership," St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler is the third major U.S. auto maker this week to open talks with the 
UAW on a new national labor agreement. The auto maker's labor pact with the 
union, which covers about 63,000 hourly workers, expires Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW traditionally chooses one of the auto makers to be a strike target 
during the course of the talks. The UAW then negotiates an agreement with that 
auto maker, the pattern of which the two other U.S. car makers are expected to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said auto makers sometimes welcome being chosen as the target, because 
it may let them negotiate a deal favorable to themselves and potentially 
harmful to their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
However, the tactic can sometimes backfire because if a snag develops in the 
talks, the targeted auto maker could be subject to a damaging strike. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has complained that because of high labor costs, it may not be able to 
follow the pattern of an agreement negotiated by its bigger and wealthier U.S. 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker, kicked off its talks with 
the UAW Wednesday on a new three-year labor pact covering about 330,000 active 
and laid-off workers. 
</P>
<P>
GM's overall stance is in keeping with the anticipated approach of the other 
auto makers, which are demanding greater flexibility to keep costs down in the 
face of tough Japanese competition. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese auto makers have built a major manufacturing presence in the United 
States, and now control a record 28% of the American car market, up from 24% 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three auto makers, which also includes Ford Motor Co., complain that 
pension and health-care costs for their workers are higher than those for the 
younger and healthier workers employed at Japanese-owned U.S. auto plants. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW has vowed that it will work with the auto makers on health care and 
says adopting a national health-care system would be the ultimate solution. 
</P>
<P>
The union, battered by widespread layoffs, is expected to push for a tightening 
of the contract language over the closing of plants. The UAW has accused the 
auto makers of exploiting the present contract to close plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three auto makers will be negotiating pacts covering about 500,000 
active and laid-off UAW members.
