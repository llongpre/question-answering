   Taking aim on the 21st century and
``multibillion-dollar global'' growth, Apple Computer Inc. Thursday
unveiled plans to slice the company's world marketing pie into
three pieces.
   Marketing will be divided into units to be called Apple USA,
Apple Europe and Apple Pacific, with the U.S. segment subdivided
into six groups reporting to Aple senior Vice President Charles M.
Boesenberg.
   ``We must continue to build an organization ... adaptable enough
to keep pace with our anticipated growth in the coming years,''
said Apple's chief operating officer, Delbert W. Yocam.
   Each of the units in the United States will tailor marketing
solutions to specific geographic and customer needs, aimed at
moving the company closer to its sources of revenue. Apple plans an
``End-User Services'' group to handle customer needs.
   Yocam said the company would appoint a vice president for the
education market in recognition of its importance to the company.
