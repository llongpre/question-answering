days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On June 30th, 1934, Adolf Hitler began his ``blood purge'' of

ally.
   On this date:
   In 1834, the Indian Territory was created by Congress.

minimum voting age to 18, was ratified as Ohio became the 38th state

   In 1977, President Jimmy Carter announced he had decided against
production of the B-1 bomber, saying it was too costly. (However,

Korea, reaffirmed America's military commitment to its Asian ally,
but also challenged his hosts to match their human rights record
with their economic achievements.
   Five years ago: John Turner was sworn in as Canada's 17th prime
minister, succeeding Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Playwright Lillian
Hellman died in Vineyard Haven, Mass., at age 79.
   One year ago: In a surprising scene, Vladimir I. Melnikov, a
delegate to a Soviet Communist Party conference, bluntly criticized
President Andrei A. Gromyko and other longtime Kremlin figures.
   Today's birthdays: Actor David Wayne is 73. Singer Lena Horne is
