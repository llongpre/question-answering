   Test pilot, astronaut and space-shuttle savior, Richard Truly has the makings of an American hero. 
Now he must take on the rather unheroic role of salesman. 

   Mr. Truly, the new head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, must convince a skeptical Congress and public that the U.S. should spend hundreds of billions of dollars to settle the moon and explore Mars. 
And he must reassure the space agency, rattled by the recent departure of 34 top managers and hounded by the ghosts of Challenger, that it's up to the task. 

   "You're talking about a sustained effort that will go well into the 21st century," Mr. Truly says. 

   The NASA administrator -- the first astronaut to serve in that post -- already has lined up three powerful allies: President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle and Budget Director Richard Darman. 
The three men accepted a NASA recommendation that President Bush declare on July 20 -- the 20th anniversary of the first Apollo moon landing -- that the U.S. will send astronauts back to the moon shortly after the year 2000 and then off to Mars. 

   "Truly has seized the agency and put his own imprint on it," says John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. 
"He got the president to embrace the boldest possible vision. 
That ain't bad." 

   It's unexpected, though. 
Temperamentally cautious and conservative, the 51-year-old ex-astronaut is known for competence, not grand gestures. 
Salesmanship seems as unnatural to him as it did to another ex-Navy man with an easy grin, Jimmy Carter. 
He comes across as dull, not inspirational. 

   Indeed, when Vice President Quayle, head of the newly created National Space Council, asked Mr. Truly to come up with a list of exploration projects, Mr. Truly initially balked. 
NASA had planned to ask the president to approve an ambitious manned program but not for another few years -- after the proposed space station had cleared its biggest budget hurdles. 

   "I was concerned we could go too fast," Mr. Truly says. 
"I didn't want NASA signed up to something we weren't prepared to accomplish." 

   But turn away from an opportunity, Mr. Truly understood, and it may not return. 
Not since John Kennedy has a president been willing to make space exploration as high a priority as President Bush. 
"As I got into it, I realized that with the proper resources and the proper vision," NASA could pull off the project, he says. 

   Mr. Truly recently appointed Aaron Cohen, head of Johnson Space Center, to put together over the next four or five months a detailed plan for manned exploration -- the first step in the lobbying process necessary to garner support. 
Included will be what he called "modest" requests for budget increases in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 1990, for technology studies, personnel increases and facilities improvements related to manned exploration. 
The Space Council will use that plan as the basis for its own deliberations. 

   "Clearly the present NASA can't do the job, but we have the core capability to take on" ambitious exploration, Mr. Truly says. 
One problem NASA faces is a recent exodus of managers who signed up during the Apollo years and fear a conflict-of-interest rule may limit their opportunities for outside employment. 
The agency also lacks a space depot for refueling spaceships and a giant spacecraft capable of lifting four or five times as much cargo as the space shuttle. 

   But any new project will face tough times in a budget-conscious Congress. 
The space station, for instance, faces a cut of about $400 million from the $2.05 billion administration request for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. 

   The cost of space exploration is warranted, Mr. Truly believes, because it will inspire a new generation to go into areas such as engineering and science. 
He sees it spurring technical innovation, thus adding to the country's wealth. 

   Mr. Truly's current job is the latest in a string of assignments that have made him an expert at living with risk. 
As a young naval aviator, he made 300 aircraft carrier landings and then signed up as a test pilot. 
In 1965, he became an astronaut, first assigned to an Air Force project to build a military space station, which was canceled before it ever flew. 
Then he became a shuttle astronaut, piloting the second flight of the shuttle and commanding the first shuttle to launch and land at night. 

   During this time, he remained in the Navy and steadily earned promotions. 
In 1983, he became the first commander of the Navy's space command, which oversees Navy satellites. 
A month after the Challenger explosion, which killed seven astronauts in January 1986, he returned to NASA as head of the space-shuttle program. 
The shuttle finally started flying again last year. 
On June 30, a day before becoming NASA administrator, he retired from the Navy as a vice admiral. 
Mr. Truly was acting administrator for a few months before being sworn in. 

   His great challenge now is to rally NASA and the country around the distant goal of manned exploration of the solar system, while making sure NASA doesn't slip back into the sloppy habits that led to the Challenger accident. 

   "We try to pound into our people (the idea that) no matter how aggressive we want to be, the best way to be successful is to fly the next flight safely and properly," he says. 
"We're working the future, but our most important job is today."
