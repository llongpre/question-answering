   The 1976 murder of former Chilean diplomat
Orlando Letelier on a tree-lined traffic circle in Washington
touched off a furor that strained U.S.-Chilean relations and sent
two men to prison.
   A third man was arrested Wednesday by the FBI in St. Petersburg,
Fla.
   Jose Dionisio Suarez y Esquivel, 51, was charged with conspiracy
to murder a foreign official. The FBI said Suarez provided the
explosives and detonating devices for the bomb that killed Letelier.
   In federal court in Tampa, Suarez waived his right to a bond
hearing and was ordered detained while he awaits trial in
Washington. Suarez faces life in prison if convicted.
   Letelier, who had criticized human rights policies of the
Chilean military government that exiled him, died Sept. 21, 1976,
when the bomb under his car exploded as he drove to work along
Washington's Embassy Row.
   Ronni Moffitt, a Letelier associate at a Washington-based think
tank, also was killed. Her husband, Michael, was injured.
   Michael V. Townley, a U.S. citizen employed by the Chilean
intelligence agency, was arrested in April 1978. Townley was
extradited to the United States, confessed to planting the bomb on
the order of superiors and was sentenced to 40 months in prison.
   A former Chilean Secret Service officer, Maj. Armando Fernandez
Larios, was sentenced in May 1987 to between 27 months and seven
years after pleading guilty to being an accessory to the
assassination.
   Immediately after the bombing, U.S. legislators and Letelier
associates charged that he was murdered by agents of the Chilean
government. Friends said Letelier had told them of repeated death
threats.
   Resolutions were introduced in Congress calling for an
investigation and protest demonstrations were held outside the
Chilean Embassy.
   The embassy denied any government involvement.
   Letelier had been foreign minister in the cabinet of the late
President Salvador Allende when Allende was overthrown by the armed
forces in 1973. He had been ambassador to the United States from
1971 until earlier in 1973.
   He was arrested and held until September 1974, when he was
released exiled. Letelier lived briefly in Venezuela, then moved to
Washington and joined the Institute for Policy Studies, a privately
financed study group.
   Initially, he was silent on Chilean affairs. In the months
before his death, however, he denounced the military junta's
alleged use of torture and other rights violations.
   On Sept. 10, just 11 days before the bombing, the junta revoked
Letelier's Chilean citizenship.
   ``I was born a Chilean, I am a Chilean, and I will die a
Chilean,'' Letelier said in response.
   In pleading guilty to the accessory charge in 1987, Fernandez
said he gave a map and surveillance notes to Townley.
   A federal court in Washington also indicted two other Chilean
Secret Service officers, Gen. Manuel Contreras Sepulveda and Col.
Pedro Espinoza Bravo, in connection with the assassination. The
Chilean Supreme Court refused to extradite them, saying the
evidence was insufficient.
   The Chilean government ordered its own investigation, headed by
Gen. Hector Orozco Sepulveda. In 1987, Orozco was implicated by a
former Chilean army major in a cover-up of Chile's role in the
killing. The Justice Department sought to question him, but the
Chilean Supreme Court said he could not be questioned about any
official activities related to his role as military prosecutor in
the probe.
   In January 1989, however, the Supreme Court in Santiago approved
a U.S. request to question seven other former officials of the
military government.
   On March 11, an elected civilian government took power in Chile,
ending 16{ years of the right-wing military rule of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a leading critic of the
Pinochet regime, said he expected the new democratic government to
allow prosecution of Contreras and Espinoza.
   Espinoza headed the Chilean National Intelligence Agency, while
Contreras was the agency's operations director.
