   It's 10 p.m. _ curfew
time. Police in camouflage fatigues tell diners sipping coffee at
the Pivoli Gardens they must leave the restaurant.
   Nobody complains.
   ``I don't mind at all,'' said Omi Rahim. ``It keeps all the
troublemakers off the streets.''
   Like others in St. Croix, Ms. Rahim vividly remembers the three
chaotic days after Hurricane Hugo devastated the island Sept. 17
when hundreds of looters plundered stores of everything from food
and clothes to VCRs and jewelry. The authorities say some police
officers and members of the National Guard took part in the looting.
   The turmoil prompted President Bush on Sept. 21 to send 1,100
Army troops, most of them military police, along with 170 FBI
agents and federal marshals, to restore order in the U.S. territory.
   With most stores cleaned out, the looting had stopped by the
time the troops arrived.
   More than two months after the storm, 80 percent of St. Croix
still lacks electricity, water and telephone service. But the
troops were ordered home before Thanksgiving and were replaced by
146 National Guard MPs from Washington, D.C.
   Many of St. Croix's 55,000 residents say it was too early to
pull the troops out.
   ``There's no electricity and there are no phones and we have no
way to call police,'' said waiter Javier Ureta, 31. ``The island is
not ready to have people move around like normal days.''
   Maj. Doug Foster, a U.S. Army spokesman, said that before
leaving the Army set up 14 citizens band stations equipped with
telephones for emergencies. A curfew is to remain in effect until
power and communications are restored.
   St. Croix, 40 miles east of Puerto Rico, was among the islands
hardest hit by Hurricane Hugo as it swept up the Caribbean before
hitting the Carolinas.
   The territorial government has estimated damage at $1 billion in
St. Croix and its sister islands, St. Thomas and St. John. While
the other two islands are bouncing back quickly, officials say
recovery could take years in St. Croix, where the storm's 200-mph
winds damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the houses and buildings.
   Tourism, St. Croix' lifeblood, is a writeoff this season for the
most part. And, despite a construction boom, there are fears of
soaring unemployment because scores of businesses were wiped out.
   St. Croix Hospital, with 250 beds, remains closed and doctors
are seeing patients in tents behind the building.
   Thousands live in roofless homes under temporary blue plastic
roofs or in Red Cross tents as they wait for the relief checks from
insurance companies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   In Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas, the top floor of Bishop Sean
O'Malley's house was blown off, but a box containing his miters
remained in place. In St. Croix, workmen had to retile the roof of
the Cormorant Beach Club, a hotel and condominium complex, and it
has been able to reopen for the winter season.
   Hundreds have fled the island, perhaps permanently. For those
who have stayed to rebuild, life can be a struggle.
   ``When you go without electricity day after day, for weeks, and
you don't have water and you don't have a roof over your head and
there are no phones and you can't communicate with the outside
world ... well, there's a lot of stress,'' said commercial
photographer Carol Lee.
   About 400 linesmen from a dozen states, Guam and Puerto Rico are
repairing lines of 15,000 downed electricity poles. The Virgin
Islands Water and Power Authority has said it could be spring
before electricity is fully restored. Meanwhile, the utility is
investigating reports of some workers charging homeowners up to
$500 to turn power on.
   But children have returned to school, shelters for victims have
closed, and many stores and restaurants along with a few hotels are
back in business, using generators for power.
   Some Crucians, as residents are known, complain that accounts
after the hurricane made the looting appear to be an uprising among
blacks, who make up 85 percent of the population, against the
wealthier whites. They scoff at reports of machete-wielding black
gangs roaming the streets.
   ``I didn't see any white people attacked, but I sensed fear
among the white people,'' said Rena Brodhurst-Knight, publisher of
the St. Croix Avis newspaper, who is black. She said machetes,
commonly used in the Caribbean as tools, were probably mistaken by
outsiders as weapons.
   The U.S. attorney's office has filed charges against 15 alleged
looters, including Adelbert Bryan, commander of the Fredericksted
police who was a gubernatorial candidate and a former St. Croix
senator.
