   Francois Mitterrand invited George
Bush to lunch Saturday on this sun-splashed French island in the
Caribbean, and residents are expecting a windfall of tourist
dollars from the publicity.
   ``This is a historic situation for St. Martin,'' said Albert
Fleming, mayor of Marigot, the capital. ``We have never had two
presidents together.''
   Bush and Mitterrand will hold a two-hour meeting and working
lunch at an exclusive sun resort on St. Martin, 140 miles east of
Puerto Rico.
   U.S. and French officials have announced no agenda for the
talks, but the two leaders are expected to discuss the latest
developments in Eastern Europe, including the reopening of borders
between East Germany and West Germany. The French president has
cautioned against a push for a reunified Germany, saying it could
upset the European balance of power.
   Mitterrand's invitation to Bush was in return for a visit the
French leader made in May to Bush's home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   On arrival at Princess Juliana International Airport on St.
Maarten, the Dutch half of the island, Bush and Mitterrand are to
be flown separately by helicopter to L'Habitation de Longvilliers,
a 253-room luxury hotel and marina at Marcel Cove on the
northeastern coast of St. Martin.
   A helicopter and scores of French presidential gendarmes and
army troops patrolled the 150-acre resort grounds Friday, checking
incoming cars with a metal detector. U.S. security officers also
were making rounds.
   At the meeting site, workers set up a beachside tent for the
leaders and hooked up communication cables.
   Bush and Mitterrand won't be mixing with residents, Fleming
said, which explains the lack of the usual welcoming banners and
bunting in the capital. A few tourist shops, however, were selling
Bush-Mitterrand T-shirts.
   ``There's a little painting up, a little taping up, but
basically that's for Christmas,'' Fleming said.
   Similarly, on Dutch St. Maarten, there was little evidence of
the event, although Roger Snow, publisher of The Chronicle
newspaper, said: ``Everybody is talking about it, of course.''
   The island Bush and Mitterrand are visiting is a curious mix of
French, Dutch and Carribbean cultures.
   St. Martin, with its sidewalk cafes, fashionable boutiques and
strolling gendarmes in khaki shorts and kneesocks, has been called
a speck of France in the Caribbean. Technically, it is a
sub-prefecture of the French overseas department of Guadeloupe,
which has a status akin to a U.S. state.
   St. Maarten is part of the autonomous five-island Netherland
Antilles. Dutch is the official language, but few people speak it.
Nearly everybody speaks English instead, although the Papiamento
language is also heard.
   The French side is 21 square miles and the Dutch side 16 square
miles. Population estimates vary widely, but the 1990 Caribbean
Island Handbook says there are at least 8,000 in St. Martin and
14,000 in St. Maarten.
   The French have some topless and all-nude beaches; the Dutch,
casino gambling. With duty-free shopping and 36 sandy white beaches
ringing the island, both sides have been experiencing a tourism
boom in recent years, with a corresponding rise in crime and
concerns about overdevelopment.
   Nevertheless, Fleming said he thought the island was bound to
benefit from having hundreds of foreign newspaper reporters and TV
crews covering the one-day summit.
   ``That exposure throughout the world is very important to
tourism'' the mayor said. ``And we cater to the tourist. We don't
have any other income but the tourist trade.''
   Fleming said 600,000 tourists a year visit the French side of
the island alone, spending $90 million, not counting cruise ship
passengers. Americans account for most of the tourist trade.
