   The strength of the U.S. economy is "vastly underrated" and should continue to dominate the globe well into the next century, according to a world-wide economic and business climate report from Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 

   The study forecasts a U.S. growth rate of about 3% on average over the next five years -- a hearty outlook that comes at a time when some economists are predicting a recession beginning next year or in 1990. 

   "They talk about things slowing down, but the economy looks strong," says Grady E. Means, international economics director of the accounting and management consulting firm's strategic management services group. 
He cited several trends including growth in real wages, continued job creation and an inflation level that's "under control." 
He added that: "The thing that impresses me most is that companies have managed to improve their productivity levels so dramatically since 1983." 

   Coopers &amp; Lybrand noted that the report's findings refute the theory of Yale University historian Paul Kennedy, author of the popular book "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers." 
Earlier this year, the book touched off national debate on whether the U.S. is the latest in a string of great powers to fail to balance economic might and military muscle. 
The defense of America's future has become a highlight issue for both sides of the presidential campaign. 

   Mr. Kennedy said the accounting firm oversimplified his thoughts on the challenges facing the superpowers going into the 21st century. 

   "These people, like so many others in the country, are no longer capable of reading the English language. 
I have put it all in terms of the conditional," Mr. Kennedy said in an interview. 
He said the Coopers &amp; Lybrand study "makes a prediction that the U.S. will be No. 1 in the 21st century. 
I'm not making a pretention {in the book}. 
I'm saying that if certain worrying trends continue, the U.S. is going to have a problem being the unchallenged No. 1 in the world." 

   Coopers &amp; Lybrand based its findings on its own economic models of 100 nations, as well as interviews with 60 top corporate executives around the world. 

   Among other things, the firm's report found that the Pacific Rim region doesn't lend itself to corporate strategy plans because the many countries -- while high-growth -- are too diverse economically and geographically to fit neatly into corporate plans. 
"We feel its strategic relevance may be overstated," said Mr. Means. 

   On the other hand, the study concluded that Latin America's business potential is underestimated because of its high debt, political history and trade policies. 
It found that Latin America's "economic and political problems are significantly overestimated and that the region will emerge as an important economic power during the next decade."
