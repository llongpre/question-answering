   After years of tight budgets, American
scientists hope the 1990s will introduce a new ``golden age'' of
space exploration. This is one of a periodic series of articles,
``The '90s,'' looking ahead to the promise and peril of the
upcoming decade, in the environment, medicine, technology and
society.

   The manned station Freedom, an
orbiting outpost of America in the icy silence of space, will take
center stage in the U.S. space effort in the 1990s, and be a
springboard for human journeys to the moon and Mars.
   American scientists also expect to reap a rich harvest during
the decade with an armada of sophisticated unmanned spacecraft that
will explore the planets and peer back into the beginning of time.
   At the same time, the Soviets will continue development of a
space shuttle and exploit their own space station Mir as they
pursue their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to Mars early in
the 21st century.
   And the growing space programs of the European Space Agency,
Japan and China will expand as they embark on their own manned
space efforts.
   As the new decade begins, America's future course is uncertain.
Its space program is at a crossroads, and it will be up to the Bush
administration, the Congress and the people to decide which
direction it should take.
   In July, on the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the
moon, President Bush stood on the steps of the National Air and
Space Museum and declared, ``We must commit ourselves anew to a
sustained program of manned exploration of the solar system, and,
yes, the permanent settlement of space.''
   He proposed ``a long-term, continuing commitment'' to completion
of space station Freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base on
the moon and a manned mission to Mars early in the next century.
   But the president provided no firm timetable or budgets for such
grand schemes, instead directing Vice President Dan Quayle, as head
of the National Space Council, to work out the details.
   Bush is expected to offer a more detailed plan in his State of
the Union address early next year.
   Freedom is the key element in the entire exploration plan, since
it would serve as a training base and launchpad for the more
ambitious flights to the moon and Mars.
   But the space station has had a troubled history. The original
plan called for astronauts aboard space shuttles to begin
assembling it in orbit in 1992, with a total of 20 shuttle flights
needed to have it fully operational by 1995.
   Cost overruns, budget cuts and NASA's poor job of selling the
station to a skeptical Congress have delayed the project, and
initial assembly is now scheduled to start in 1995 or 1996.
   The U.S. cost will be about $25 billion, with European, Japanese
and Canadian partners contributing modules and other station
facilities worth an additional $8 billion. This will give
astronaut-researchers of these nations access to the station and
provide them with valuable experience for developing independent
manned space programs.
   Orbiting 250 miles up, the station would provide living and
working quarters for as many as eight people, with astronauts
rotating back to Earth after four to six months. Some would stay
longer to gain long-term exposure to weightless living, in
preparation for a Mars flight that might take as long as 18 months.
   As a scientific base, the station will allow humans to study the
stars and planets from the pollution-free environment of space. The
weightless world will permit the processing of new, pure medicines,
metals and other products that cannot be made in Earth's gravity.
And astronauts aboard Freedom would assemble, service and repair
satellites and send them out to explore space.
   Space science is experiencing a resurgence after years of
neglect because of tight NASA budgets.
   ``We are embarking on a golden age of space science,'' said
Lennard Fisk, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of
unprecedented excitement and activity.''
   Among the events scheduled in the 1990s:
   _Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May, is to orbit
Venus next August and will study that planet for several years.
   _Galileo, launched from a shuttle in October, is to orbit
Jupiter in 1995 and fire a probe into its atmosphere. En route,
Galileo will probe Venus and take the first closeup look at an
asteroid.
   _COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer), set for launch Nov. 19, will
spend years studying how stars and galaxies were formed by
analyzing cosmic background radiation consisting of particles of
light, or photons, permeating the universe.
   _ROSAT, a cooperative mission with West Germany, will be
launched next year to send back a detailed survey of X-rays emitted
into the universe by violent explosions, such as those occurring at
the end of a star's life.
   _Hubble Space Telescope, to be launched from a shuttle next
March, will enable astronomers to observe stars and galaxies so far
away that they will be viewing these remote bodies as they existed
14 billion years ago, near the time scientists believe the universe
was formed.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in 1992 to orbit the red planet
for a multiyear examination.
   _Other payloads scheduled for deployment from the shuttle in the
next few years include a series of Astro spacecraft carrying
ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes to study quasars, pulsars and
other celestial objects; the Gamma Ray Observatory to explore gamma
ray sources throughout the universe, and Ulysses, to probe the sun.
   During the 1990s, NASA will also continue research, together
with the Defense Department, on developing the National Aerospace
Plane, which would take off from a runway like a jet plane and
accelerate into orbit. If Congress provides adequate funding for
this next-generation manned space vehicle, a prototype could begin
test flights late in the decade, and it could become operational
sometime after 2000.
