  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton outlined three major Russian tasks in a live TV address 
at the major Ostankino TV and Radio Company here today. 
  He said Russian future will much depend on whether the 
country will continue to create a genuine market economy, 
whether Russian citizens will remain adherent to democracy and 
prevent any limits on it and whether Russia will keep to its 
previous role on the international scene or change it. 
  The President expressed his admiration with Russian 
achievements in literature, art, on the battle field and in 
space. He said the Communist system suppressed people and led 
to the cold war. Nevertheless, greatness of the Russian people 
has been always evident and it has a prospect to become powerful 
and prospering on the eve of the 21st century. 
  Despite the fact old human vices -- hatred and racial 
intolerance -- remain, the greatness of peoples in the 21st 
century will be determined not by their ability to impose their 
will on others but by the ability to enable everyone to use all 
possibilities of modern and future world regardless one's race 
and sex, said Clinton. 
  As for Russia and the United States they are bound to make 
their contribution to the consolidation of the spirit of 
cooperation and partnership throughout the world and improvement 
of everyday life of each person, including Russian citizens. 
Clinton stressed Russians themselves are to make their own 
future. 
  In their turn, the U.S. people and President want to be 
partners and sincere friends of Russia, he added. Clinton said 
he ran for U.S. President to make sure changes for the better 
come true. 
  Dwelling on the development of Russian economy, the U.S. 
President agreed transition to market economy was painful and 
difficult, it even disoriented Russian citizens. However, in 
his opinion, Russia would have to pay more for being idle or 
trying to turn back. State-controlled economy does not work in 
the modern world, said Clinton. The old system was doomed to 
failure, and if Russians try to re-introduce it it will fail 
again, assured the President. 
  Speaking of Russian economic problems, Clinton noted high 
inflation rates. In his words, the inflation must be curbed 
down, but it will also claim some price. Another problem is the 
need to create a system of social guarantees for people affected 
by swift economic development. Clinton said the Americans will 
do their best to make the difficulties easier as Russians 
progress on their path. 
  Clinton said a major task of the Russian people is 
consolidation of democracy, since it gives the most reliable 
guarantees of observation and protection of ethnic minorities' 
rights. In order to ensure democracy, everyone should denounce 
intolerance, hatred and antisemitism, said Clinton. 
  The U.S. President focused on human rights and said America 
warns other states against disrespect for rights of ethnic 
Russians. 
  Clinton said he is concerned with some irresponsible 
statements recently made on the Russian political scene and, 
without mentioning Zhirinovskiy's name, added with a smile he is 
not going to return Alaska to Russia. 
  The President expressed the assurance the future measurement 
of Russian greatness will be its ability to be a peace-loving 
neighbour. 
  Speaking of common European problems, Clinton noted this is 
the first time ever Europe is not divided, it is united with 
adherence to democracy, free market economy and the availability 
of common borders. 
  The U.S. state head said he is satisfied with the Russian 
president's decision to participate in the Partnership for Peace 
initiative and work for integration of Europe. He especially 
praised the historic Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement on 
elimination of nuclear arms signed in Moscow. 
  In his opinion, it is sign the future will be considerably 
different from the past. The Russian fate may also influence 
that of America and the United States wants Russia to make 
decisions that will be good for itself. 
  Many people gathered in the Ostankino studio to meet the 
U.S. 
President. The studio was also connected with some Russian 
cities whose residents were welcome to ask questions. 
  Part of the audience, mainly philology students, asked 
questions in good English, which made Clinton wonder whether 
everyone in the studio is from Moscow State University and 
speaks without an accent. 
  Asked what is the difference between the United States and 
Russia, the President said Americans have created their 
democracy for 200 years, and Russia has the world's youngest 
democracy. Still, he said there is plenty of similarities in 
characters of the two peoples. 
  A representative of Stavropol Cossacks asked Clinton in what 
form the United States may participate in settlement of 
conflicts in Russia. The President gave an evasive answer and 
spoke of Yugoslavia where the U.N. peace-makers are trying to 
help avoid victims. 
  The President was asked two questions about the Baltic 
Republics. The first question wondered why America does not want 
to render assistance to states striving for democracy, including 
the Baltic Republics. The other wondered why America helps the 
Baltic states despite their infringement on rights of the 
Russian-speaking minority. 
  Clinton said he wants to render assistance to the Baltic 
states and invite them to the Partnership for Peace together 
with Russia. They will participate in outlining joint military 
plans, military operations and so on. If they decide to join 
NATO, they will have to take certain obligations, safety 
guarantees, said the President. 
  In the opinion of the U.S. President, the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Lithuania testifies to the Russian 
Government's satisfaction with the state of bilateral relations. 
  Problems with Estonia and Latvia remain unsettled, added the 
President and said an international group representing CSCE is 
studying the human rights situation in these states. In the 
words of Clinton, he has warned heads of the Baltic states that 
if violations of rights of the Russian-speaking population are 
revealed, this will tell on the U.S. policy towards those states. 
  Asked about prospects for U.S. economic assistance to 
Russian 
businessmen, the President said he thinks there should be much 
more U.S. investments in Russia. In his words, the U.S. 
secretary of commerce will come to Russia in March with a large 
group of U.S. businessmen to persuade them to invest in Russia. 
  The question of a 13-year-old boy "When did you decide to 
become U.S. President?" came somewhat unexpectedly. Clinton 
said he was sixteen years old when he shook Kennedy's hand and 
approximately at the same time he understood he wants to serve 
for the state. 
  He shook the boy's hand and said maybe one day he will 
become 
Russian president. 
  Speaking to the audience in Nizhnyy Novgorod, the President 
said it would be good for U.S. college and school students to 
come to Russia for studies. If Boris Yeltsin addresses a U.S. 
audience, few U.S. students would be able to talk to him in 
Russian, admitted the U.S. President and again praised language 
abilities of his young Russian interlocutors. 
  A youngster asked the President whether he would play 
saxophone for them, but Clinton answered he had played saxophone 
at Thursday's dinner for President Yeltsin and added he has a 
one-time saxophone play quota for each country.
