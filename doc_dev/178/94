   A federal appeals court has rejected Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis' attempt to use his power as
governor to block a Massachusetts National Guard training mission in
Central America.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-sentence order
Tuesday affirming a May 6 decision by U.S. District Judge Robert
Keeton, who upheld federal supremacy over the National Guard.
   ``Having examined the briefs of the parties ... and having had
the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the judgment on the basis
stated in the district court's well-reasoned opinion,'' the appeals
court said.
   Dukakis sued in January to block the assignment of 13 public
relations specialists in the Massachusetts Guard to Honduras and
Panama for two weeks in May because of his opposition to Reagan
administration policies in the region.
   In his presidential campaign, Dukakis has denounced the
administration for its ``failed and illegal'' policy of supporting
Nicaraguan rebels, and he said sending Guard troops to the region
was an attempt to intimidate Nicaragua.
   Dukakis, who was campaigning Tuesday in California and Colorado,
had no immediate comment on the appellate decision. A press aide,
Steven Crawford, said the governor was disappointed that the court
chose not to uphold the ``important principle'' of state authority.
   State Attorney General James Shannon, who represented Dukakis in
court, said he would wait until another federal appeals court rules
in a similar challenge before deciding whether to appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   John Bolton, chief of the civil division in the U.S. Justice
Department, said he was pleased by the ruling: ``It represents the
complete vindication of the administration's position.''
   After Keeton issued his ruling in May, Dukakis appealed but did
not try to stop the Massachusetts troops from participating in the
exercises, which involved road-building.
   In his decision, Keeton explicitly upheld the constitutionality
of the Montgomery Amendment, a 1986 act of Congress that says
governors may not decline such assignments ``because of any
objection to the location, purpose, type or schedule of such
activity.''
   ``At issue in this case is the constitutional status of the
modern National Guard,'' Keeton wrote, framing his question in terms
of competing clauses in the U.S. Constitution that divided control
over the new nation's militia between the federal government and the
states.
   Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department argued that the ``Army
Clause'' in the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate say over
the nation's entire military apparatus. They described Dukakis'
position as ``a dagger aimed at the heart of national defense.''
   The Massachusetts' attorney general's office, representing
Dukakis, had claimed that the ``Militia Clause'' reserved power to
the governors over training the militia.
   Assistant Attorney General Douglas Wilkins stressed the
``original intent'' of the Constitution's framers, arguing that
state control over the ``militia'' was essentially undisturbed by
the many reorganizations of the nation's military.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, joined by Massachusetts and nine
other states, challenged the law last year in U.S. District Court in
St. Paul and lost. The case is now on appeal.
