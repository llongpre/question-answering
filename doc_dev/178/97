As authorities continued to search for clues to the cause of a military 
helicopter crash over the weekend in South Korea, officials released the names 
Tuesday of the 19 men who died in the fiery accident, most of them Marines from 
Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators remain unsure what caused the CH -- 53D Sea Stallion to go down 
at 10:50 a.m. Sunday (PST) in a dry riverbed while preparing to drop off 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in finding a cause as quickly as we can," said Capt. Laurie 
Pratt, a Marine spokeswoman in Washington. "But it's very common that these 
investigations can take some time." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities at Camp Pendleton, meanwhile, were busy preparing for a 
Thursday-morning memorial service for the 16 Marines from the sprawling base 
north of Oceanside who died in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The dead also included the pilot and co-pilot of the Tustin-based helicopter 
and a Navy medical corpsman, whose identity was withheld pending notification 
of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Marines survived the crash, two of them crewmen on the helicopter and 
the rest from Camp Pendleton. Nine of the survivors suffered serious injuries 
and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Camp Pendleton Marines aboard the downed helicopter were from C 
Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. The 
battalion, more than 800 men strong, left Camp Pendleton last month for a 
six-month deployment in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred during a joint military exercise involving more than 200,000 
U.S. and South Korean troops. Dubbed Team Spirit, the exercise is an annual 
test for the two countries and is scheduled to end Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say witnesses reported that the troop transport helicopter fell to 
the ground with no collision with other aircraft or sign of engine trouble. 
Night goggles, which have been blamed for several recent military helicopter 
crashes, were not at issue because the accident occurred in daylight. 
</P>

<P>
Copter in Crash Has Dubious Past 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Stallion has had a troubled history of military use. In 1987, the 
entire fleet of more than 90 helicopters was grounded for about a month because 
of concerns about the craft's air safety. Despite the latest crash of copter, 
which is manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft Co. of Stratford, Conn., senior 
military officers have said they will not ground the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dead Marines are the pilot, Capt. Michael McGreevy, 27, of Monmouth, 
N.J., and the co-pilot, 1st Lt. David M. Pimple, 25, of Cochise, Ariz. 
</P>
