   As many as 100 Americans will be
asked to testify at the trial of suspected TWA hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi, court officials said Friday.
   Hamadi, jailed in Frankfurt, is charged with air piracy and the
slaying of of an American sailor in the 1985 hijacking of a
jetliner on a flight from Athens to Rome. The hijackers held 39
Americans hostage in Beirut for 17 days.
   A spokesman for Hesse state court, Judge Thomas Kehren, told a
news conference the West German government will pay expenses of
Americans who appear in court.
   ``Maybe 100 American citizens will be asked to travel from the
United States to testify at the trial,'' he said.
   Those who don't want to travel can give sworn depositions, he
added.
   The news conference was called to clarify why the Hamadi case
was turned over to a juvenile court by the adult state court in
Frankfurt earlier this week.
   Court officials also used the news conference to indirectly
criticize U.S. officials who are calling on West Germany to try
Hamadi as an adult.
   The juvenile court will determine whether to deal with Hamadi as
a juvenile, adolescent or adult, Kehren said.
   If the court treats the suspect as an adult, it could sentence
him to life in prison upon conviction. Hamadi could receive a
maximum 10-year jail sentence if tried as a juvenile and 10 to 15
years if tried as an adolescent, Kehren said.
   West German law defines a juvenile as anyone under 18 years of
age, an adolescent as 18 to 21 years old and an adult as 21 or over.
   The Hamadi case was turned over to the juvenile court because
there is ``doubt about whether he was 21 at the time he began the
process of committing the crimes he is charged with,'' the
spokesman said.
   The trial was to begin next month, but court officials now say
it will have to be put off for several months as the juvenile court
studies the case and arranges for witnesses to testify.
   The hijacking began June 14, 1985, a day after Hamadi's 21st
birthday, but officials say planning of the crime likely began
before he became a legal adult. Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt
Airport on Jan. 13, 1987, and charged with carrying liquid
explosives.
   The court's president, Judge Karl Stephan, said the case was
given to the juvenile court to prevent the suspect from appealing a
decision by a state adult court on the issue of his age.
   In Washington earlier this week, State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said ``we expect ... and hope that Hamadi will be
tried and sentenced as an adult.''
   But Stephan told reporters, ``No outside comments will be
allowed to influence the case.''
   Judge Horst-Guenter Haas, another official attending the news
conference, said, ``It is dangerous for a court if there is even a
mere appearance that outside considerations would be included in
its decision.''
   West German officials last year rejected a request that Hamadi
be extradited to stand trial in the United States for the slaying
of Navy diver Robert Stethem during the hijacking. The decision
came after two West Germans were kidnapped in Beirut.
