<LEADPARA>  COMPOSER John Adams' "El Dorado" ("The Golden One") was unveiled in a
shimmering world premiere Wednesday night at the San Francisco Symphony, with
Adams conducting.;    This was, in effect, the Berkeley composer's Christopher
Columbus piece, coming just before the 500th anniversary of Columbus' arrival
in the New World. Instead of focusing on the controversial discoverer,
however, Adams explored the dream of finding a gilded paradise here,
implicitly contrasting that dream with the current ravaging of our planet, one
of Adams' stated concerns.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  REVIEW;  PERFORMANCE;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 11/16/91, pg. 2C); 
Because of an editor's error, a caption in Friday's eye was incorrect. It
should have stated that John Adams' 29-minute "El Dorado" received a standing
ovation from the San Francisco Symphony audience.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     His 29-minute work got a standing ovation from many of the Davies Hall
patrons. It is so beautifully crafted in a style that is both familiar and
monumental that it likely will be performed and recorded often.;    Snobs may
scoff at Adams' tried-and-true writing. There's the familiar crescendoing
pulse in the opening movement ("Bolero," anyone?), and the closing movement
forays into Sibelius-tinged orchestration, New Age sounds, and the Steve Reich
style of phase-shift music begun a generation ago.;    But Adams, 44, remains
one of the champion colorists of the late 20th century. His minimalism for
maximum orchestra is awe- inspiring, and in "El Dorado" he creates gilded
pyramids of thoroughly consonant sound.;    While most symphonic composers are
still uncomfortable with electronic music, Adams is as much at ease with it as
with the full instrumental array on stage, which, for "El Dorado," included an
army of eight percussionists and heavy brass.;    His signal breakthrough in
this piece is the idiomatic integration of two synthesizers into the
orchestral texture. They spray their fine mist of exotic timbres and pitches
through the hall via 10 loudspeakers.;    Clearly Adams has broken through the
computer-phobia rampant at symphonies around the country, and it is high time.
Now any young symphonic composer who doesn't learn to use the synthesizer will
be ill prepared to create 21st-century music.;    The rest of the program
consisted of an Adams orchestration of a piece by Liszt, and two Stravinsky
works. I was far more impressed with Adams' version of Liszt's "The Black
Gondola" this week than in hearing it at the Cabrillo Music Festival three
months ago. The funereal piece shone Wednesday, illuminated by the expert
players and a more vibrant hall.;    The original Liszt composition was for
cello and piano. Adams' orchestration incorporates a lot of low instruments --
English horn, violas and bass clarinet -- and does so exquisitely. Toward the
end, it employs a celestial choir of cellos. This highly sophisticated,
pictorial piece contrasts markedly with some vacuous Liszt works heard all too
often. It was deliciously chromatic -- and moving, too.;    As a conductor,
Adams has his strong and weak points. "El Dorado" seemed by far the most
successful effort Wednesday. In the two Stravinsky pieces, he blunted the
accents and sapped much of their energy.;    In the prickly Stravinsky Violin
Concerto, however, soloist Stephanie Chase, formerly of the Bay Area, gave a
more exciting reading than I have ever heard. I'm baffled why Chase has not
soloed with more of our major orchestras. After melting the hall with the
soulful "Aria II," she gave a masterful version of the tricky finale.;    The
hall needed all the melting it could get. Apparently cool to contemporary
music this fall, patrons stayed away in droves, just as they did for the
"Pulcinella" program conducted by visiting Baltimore Symphony music director
David Zinman two weeks ago.;    The other Stravinsky work, the whimsical opera
excerpt "The Song of the Nightingale," opened the program. But this time the
nightingale was sedate, with no punch.;    The concert will be broadcast Nov.
