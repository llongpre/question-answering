<LEADPARA>  CANDIDATES for San Jose Symphony's music directorship are being aggressively
courted by rival organizations, just as though they were the most eligible
bachelors at the prom.;    Leonid Grin, the Soviet emigre who scored such a
vibrant success with critics and audiences when he was guest conductor in
February, looked like the front-runner for a similar vacancy at the Spokane,
Wash., Symphony. Spokane reps even traveled to hear him in San Jose, and Grin
went to Spokane to conduct some audition rehearsals.;    But now, amid great
sighs of relief by local symphony-watchers, Spokane has named another Soviet
emigre -- Vakhtang Jordania -- as its music director. So Grin remains in the
running for San Jose -- at least until the next offer pops up on his fax
machine.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     San Jose already has lost candidate John Mauceri, another preseason
favorite, at least in this critic's view, until his cancellation and
withdrawal last month.;    BERKELEY MINIMALIST composer John Adams' upcoming
opera may be too political for its own good. Even with the Persian Gulf war
now over, the work is being treated with extreme caution and special security
measures.;    "The Death of Klinghoffer" is based on the 1985 Palestinian
terrorist attack on the Mediterranean cruise ship Achille Lauro, which
resulted in the death of one passenger, an escape by air, an interception by
U.S. jets, and a trial in Italy in which the terrorists were found guilty.;   
The opus may prove as politically sensitive as classics of the genre such as
"The Marriage of Figaro," "Rigoletto" and "Un ballo in maschera.";    Next
week's world premiere in Brussels, Belgium, of this operatic collaboration
between composer Adams and stage director Peter Sellars is being orchestrated
with a news brownout. There are no interviews, and, until two weeks before the
March 19 opening, there were no press releases, either.;    The work, coming
to the San Francisco Opera in the fall of 1992, opens in the Monnaie Opera
House with Adams in attendance.;    The unsettled world situation is also a
factor in the cancellation of upcoming tours to Western Europe by the New York
Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard
Slatkin. The Philharmonic was to make an Easter tour, while the St. Louis
orchestra was to have gone in February.;    THE COMPUTER-MUSIC studio at
Stanford University has aroused controversy over a concert coming Thursday
night to Dinkelspiel Auditorium, because Norwegian composer Per Landa insists
on passing out earplugs for those who will be hearing his high-volume music.; 
  "That (high a sound level) is utterly against my philosophy, but I can't be
tyrannical," says studio director John Chowning. The concert also features
composers from Argentina and Stanford.;    On a more harmonious note, Chowning
is working to bring over from the USSR the legendary Leon Theremin, who
invented one of the first electronic instruments (named the theremin) around
1924. Chowning met him on his recent Soviet visit and found him spry and
active at 95, eager to return to the United States, where he had lived for a
time until 1938. Theremin once met with Lenin himself to demonstrate his
instrument and apparently left the Red leader impressed with his revolutionary
device.;    THE DEATH of New York composer Elie Siegmeister at 82 deprives the
music world of a live-wire author, raconteur, educator, and prolific composer
on American themes. He studied abroad with Nadia Boulanger and had his music
played by Arturo Toscanini, who was never known to be a champion of American
music. Five seasons ago the San Jose Symphony, under George Cleve, played
Siegmeister's "Ozark Set."  </TEXT>
