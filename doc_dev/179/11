<LEADPARA>  THE 29th annual Cabrillo Music Festival finally engaged Santa Cruz's own Tandy
Beal &amp; Company to present a program Saturday afternoon. Banding with Beal
produced a world premiere choreography, as well as that marvelous
Genesis-in-rewind-mode dance called "La creation du monde" (The Creation of
the Earth).;    The pairing was a congenial one, echoed by a ballet-inspired
orchestral program given Friday night, also under John Adams' baton.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Dancer-choreographer Beal is bursting in quirky moves and instant
Chaplin-like humor, mixing mimic fun with sight-gag theater, using the arms
more than legs for the center of attention.;    In her new piece "Sequenza V,"
named after Berio's solo-trombone avant-garde composition, she turned musician
Daniel Livesay into an actor, and surrounded him with masked figures hidden in
Picasso-like cubisms -- cone shapes, zany paste-on eyes and "wrong-place"
facial features.;    She feeds the creative furnaces by putting musical notes
into a giant music machine, and ends it all with an action-painting sequence
leaving the scene as wildly color-splotched as the music itself. I think
Luciano Berio would enjoy Beal's responsiveness to his music and like the
novelty of those paste-on noses, mouths and ears.;    An imaginative Beal; 
We've already had do-it-yourself. It took Beal to dream up glue-it-yourself.; 
  Beal tore up the original scenario for "La creation du monde," the
pioneering 1923 dance score by composer Darius Milhaud. Her view now has the
Creation in reverse -- an idea very appealing philosophically to us troubled
modern urban-dwellers. The couples dancing in ballrooms undergo a transition
of decay and disruption. Plant life runs amok, supplants the architecture, and
creates an Eden with the dancers becoming restored Adams and Eves. The piece
is a marvelous reflection on our civilization, further allowing set designer
Kevin Constant to produce verdant vines as if out of a Rousseau primitive
painting.;    Beal's six dancers stood aside for her rapid-fire solo
"Mysterious Barricades," a funny invention of limbs turning into mirrors, of
twitches, of snaky undulations, and of hands that grab where they shouldn't,
all at such a wild pace that it's almost over before it starts.;    Live music
was used throughout -- a welcome luxury for Beal, allowing Adams' festival
orchestra to shine in the Milhaud piece. William Trimble's alto sax solo
Saturday was delicious.;    Milhaud always insisted this was the first jazz
used in serious concert music. Its recurrent oboe solo also apparently
inspired a major theme of George Gershwin's "Three Preludes" (1926) for solo
piano.;    "I don't really like new music," composer-conductor John Adams
insists publicly. He made an exception for Friday night when he programmed
"Eros Piano" (1989) by -- surprise! -- John Adams himself. The orchestral part
is almost non-existent. The piano part Friday night was turned over to Adams'
longtime friend Mack McCray, who recreated this tribute to that new-age
classicist among composers, the late Morton Feldman.;    This is a nostalgic
mood piece, conjuring up visions of late-night clouds of cigarette smoke, as
wispy as the limpid jazz harmonies clinging around the keyboard during this
14-minute U.S. premiere.;    Adams' concert programming was effective. Two
ballet scores complemented each other with their sonic zing and percussive
sparkle. Adams unearthed a long swatch of act-two music from Benjamin
Britten's exotic fairy tale "The Prince of Pagodas" (1957). Most of it follows
the soft-focus Holst-Delius strain common in English music. But one magical
number has the most astute orchestral-percussion simulation of the highly
volatile Balinese gamelan (traditional percussion orchestra) that you'll ever
hear.;    Britten's effect;  The short gamelan section rings with the "beats"
of nearly attuned pairings, with the serene tootling of high flute, and with
the highly agitated explosions of metallic sounds. This was all a result of a
single 1956 Balinese visit by the brilliantly adventurous Britten, who
assimilated one of the richest and most complex musical traditions in that
brief exposure.;    His uneven story ballet -- all about a Cinderella in an
Eastern land of magic -- offers several instrumental solos, and a bracing
musical "collision" of orchestra with off-stage trumpets doing their own
thing.;    Stravinsky's revolutionary 1911 ballet score "Petrouchka" was an
apt companion piece, even with Conductor Adams whittling down its exclamation
points and irreverent outbursts in his interpretation.;    Once again the
orchestra under Adams showed indifferent polish and accuracy. But these two
opuses offered some colossal solo work by principal players like William
Winant (percussion), Adam Gordon (trumpet), Emily Wong-George (piano) and the
remarkable concertmaster Elizabeth Baker. Baker was subbing superbly on
emergency basis for Romuald Tecco, who had a death in the family.  </TEXT>
