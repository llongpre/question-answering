Composer Charles Wuorinen is confident that avant-garde music only needs 
adequate exposure to win over reluctant listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of acceptance depends on familiarity," he said. "After all, Bach 
and Beethoven wrote demanding music, but because it is played by devoted 
performers and taught in schools that value the music, ultimately, the complex 
and demanding becomes familiar. Their music is loved, even if it may not be 
understood." 
</P>
<P>
Wuorinen has but a single opportunity, however, to make his case to the San 
Diego Symphony audience Thursday evening at UC San Diego's Mandeville 
Auditorium. In the inaugural concert of the symphony's Pulitzer Series, the 
51-year-old New York composer will conduct a pair of his recent works as well 
as two Stravinsky compositions. 
</P>
<P>
At the expense of cultivating an adoring and understanding public, Wuorinen, 
who is often described as a second-generation 12-tone composer, has made 
"complex and demanding" his musical credo. Despite a prolific output -- about 
160 works in almost every musical medium -- he has never attracted the 
attention of such minimalist media darlings as Philip Glass and John Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who write real music do not do it for the immediate satisfaction, 
but in the hope that it will last. That which is wildly popular will not last 
-- the more popular they are, the shorter their works will be around," Wuorinen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he wishes to be known as a minimalist basher. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimalism is not the issue," he said. "My problem is this: A lot of music 
that is essentially pop music is now being declared to be serious music and 
played on programs with Beethoven, Mozart and yours truly. Entertainment is 
healthy in its place, but I object to confusing it with the higher arts." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that Wuorinen's non-stop flow of awards and prizes, starting at 
age 16 with the New York Philharmonic Young Composers Award, has forged such 
unwavering self-confidence. In 1970, while in his early 30s, he was the 
youngest composer to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize (and the first to receive one 
for a composition of electronic music), and in 1986 he won a megabuck MacArthur 
Foundation Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
If Wuorinen has been loathe to cultivate a personal following, he has regularly 
collaborated with major orchestras to keep his music before the public. Last 
year, Wuorinen completed a four-year residency with the San Francisco Symphony, 
where he also served as the orchestra's new-music adviser. He showered music 
director Herbert Blomstedt with praise for giving his compositions thorough 
preparation and first-rate performances. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra also made a compact disc of Wuorinen's "The Golden Dance" and 
Third Piano Concerto, with Garrick Ohlsson as soloist. In January, 1989, the 
composer's only opera, "The W. of Babylon," was given its sole performance in a 
concert setting by the San Francisco Symphony. Subtitled a "Baroque Burlesque," 
the lascivious (according to local music critics) and satirical opera had been 
sitting on the shelf since its completion in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a happy relationship. I had a very good time while I was there, and our 
relationship will continue. I'm putting the final touches on a work for chorus 
and orchestra that San Francisco will be playing in March." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the time spent in San Francisco working with the symphony, the New 
York native did not discover a distinctly West Coast school of composition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many different approaches -- the range of compositional style is 
so great. How would you put, say, Lou Harrison, John Adams and a Roger Reynolds 
in the same category? The cultural scene is so adrift, you begin to ask, 'Does 
anything mean anything?' " 
</P>
<P>
When Wuorinen ascends the Mandeville Auditorium podium to conduct "Bamboola 
Squared" for orchestra and quadraphonic tape, the piece will finally have come 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"The tape for 'Bamboola Squared' was produced and realized at the university's 
Center for Music Experiment laboratory. The piece was written for the New York 
Philharmonic's 1984 Horizons Festival, which (UCSD professor) Roger Reynolds 
and I co-produced." (Reynolds' music will be featured on the San Diego 
Symphony's next Pulitzer Series program on Feb. 15 at UCSD.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Wuorinen asked the center to retool the tape portion of "Bamboola 
Squared" in the latest electronic technology -- magneto-optical hard disc -- 
for this performance with the San Diego Symphony, the center's wizards could 
not comply. 
</P>
<P>
"The new technology is not as reliable in performance, say, as a clarinet," 
said the centerspokesman, John Lauer. "But we did recompute the file that 
Wuorinen left when he first made the tape in '84 and freshened it up a bit." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday's program, Wuorinen will also conduct his 1988 "Machault, mon 
chou," one of the works written for the San Francisco Symphony and dedicated to 
Blomstedt. The Stravinsky pieces will be "Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto and 
"Monumentum pro Gesualdo di Venosa."
