<LEADPARA>  THE signature of a music festival is its echo in the mind -- the sonic
impression that lingers after the last bouquet of roses has been handed to the
last soloist.;    By that criterion, the Cabrillo Music Festival went out with
flying colors on Sunday night.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Forget the unsuccessful new compositions heard in its two-week run. Forget
the deficits. Forget the peccadilloes of the orchestra. Forget the worries
about whether the festival's in absentia music director, Dennis Russell
Davies, will keep his word and return in 1992.;    Sunday's finale was
brilliant. Everything came together to tie up the season with a golden bow.;  
 Britten's and Mahler's eloquence on the theme of death and Mozart's eloquence
on life furnished music with provocative polarities.;    Pianist Richard Goode
was exceptional in his articulate, propulsive reading of Mozart's Piano
Concerto No. 25 in C Major (K. 503), one of the finest readings I've
encountered in this Mozart-saturated year.;    The long, grandiose concerto,
which anticipates Beethoven, is a marvel of architecture, articulation,
allusion and affection. The main piano theme of the opening, for instance, is
an upbeat reworking of Papageno's coda of lament from the end of Mozart's
opera "The Magic Flute.";    Mozart left only a couple of cadenzas (solo
display segments) for his late concertos, and none for No. 25. So Goode wrote
his own, and it comes as close to Mozart's style as any I've encountered,
including Daniel Barenboim's likable recorded one.;    Even more to my liking
were Goode's seamless lines, his way of caressing the notes, and his singing
tone.;    John Adams conducted capably, keying closely to Goode's reading.;   
This was the hit-or-miss Cabrillo orchestra's finest evening of the season.
The group was more responsive and richer texturally than in other
performances.;    In Britten's "Sinfonia da Requiem" and Mahler's
tragic-romantic "Kindertotenlieder" ("Songs on the Death of Children"), the
renditions were often stirring and the solos in the latter work often stellar,
thanks to Yvonne Powers (oboe), Patricia Barry (English horn) and Fred
Bergstone (horn).;    In the Mahler work -- the saddest piece I ever hope to
hear -- baritone Sanford Sylvan was not at his best vocally, and his lyric
instrument is too light for this song cycle. But his musical intelligence and
his command of German are so refined that the poems were devastating in their
understatement.;    The "Sinfonia da Requiem" (1940) is a piece of fire and
ice, in which composer Britten meets the dual tragedies of a death in the
family and the growing devastation of World War II with a stiff upper lip.;   
Composer-conductor Adams offers engaging program annotations, but this year's
festival seemed fixated on death, with nine performances over two weekends
presenting death-related music.;    Adams' own compositions were welcome,
though they barely hinted at his stylistic versatility.;    The acoustic
limitations of the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium are something Adams and music
director Davies simply have to bear. The Sunday concert benefited from removal
of the hall's sound-absorbent curtains.;    Despite the problems, the Cabrillo
Festival is an asset to be cherished. The friendliness at Cabrillo is
legendary, from the crowd around the tostada stand in the street to the folks
schmoozing (and not snoozing) in the hall.;    There's a jaunty reveling here
in symphonic programs of 20th-century music that would terrify marketing
directors at many big-city orchestras. There's a bucolic informality, with
musicians in rehearsal togs and conductor Adams in clothes that had a rumpled,
slept-in look. But all were totally engaged in their music-making. It's the
ambiance that opens the door to musical adventurousness.  </TEXT>
