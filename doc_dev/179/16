<LEADPARA>  The Cabrillo Music Festival's opening weekend took its listeners through
adventurous modern terrain, with JoAnn Falletta conducting two programs at the
Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.;    The modern scores dealt out in saturation to
the music stands reached a climax at the Saturday matinee, and it proved too
much for some. One fast-wilting out-of-town music critic dashed out to the
intermission refreshment stand gasping, "Double espresso!"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The recession also dampened the impact, with attendance far below past
norms. The biggest of the first three concert crowds was 400 -- less than half
a house.;    But there was recurrent excitement and renewal, especially in
Saturday's new music by emerging West Coast composers born between 1943 and
1957, selected by a six-member jury.;    Imaginative use of ritual;  Upstaging
all the Californians was the Alaskan composer John Luther Adams -- no relation
to the John (Coolidge) Adams conducting other parts of the festival. Adams had
a flair for timeless ritual, with bass-drum tattoos suggesting Inouit
ceremonies. Brass stationed around the higher echelons of the auditorium
played an insistent, mystical music using the ambiguous notes and chords from
the string players' so-called open strings. The hypnotic spatial music
entitled "The Far Country of Sleep" at a quarter-hour was the matinee's
longest, yet it seemed the shortest on the program.;    Two of the five
composers were associated with Stanford University. Ross Bauer showed a
complex organization in his "Neon" (1988), yet it was very easy to listen to,
with its sonic brilliance and soothing textures. The busy piece was like a
platter with a lot of good seasonings. The work was an ebullient
curtain-raiser, with many solos and uncommon sounds in bass clarinet, tuba,
piccolo and other exotica.;    David Jaffe's "Whoop for Your Life!" (1987)
struck me as a bundle of shards trying to find their place within some
structural whole. Jaffe seemed to make a conscious attempt to avoid idiomatic
gestures of orchestral writing, and he showed some of the uninhibited nature
of an action painter, but without all the glue needed to make his eclectic
piece stick together. He seemed uncomfortable with string writing, and he got
his best effects with haunting, heavily muted low brass outpourings.;    Two
others showed an extra-serious bent, such as you'd expect to find around
university composers. The German immigrant Stefan Carow's "Five Pieces for
Orchestra" (world premiere) was an austere, atonal, post-Schoenbergian work of
sparse ingredients, like a Kandinsky painting. The Schoenberg clue lay not
just in the texture, but in the title, which Schoenberg himself had used in
1909.;    Allen Shearer's Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra was a stoical
eight-minute opus, with Barbara Shearer providing the pristine structures of
the solo part.;    Inspired by traditional songs; The night before, Falletta
-- a conductor more notable for her diplomatic, no-nonsense efficiency than
moving performances -- had introduced "Due Ye No. 2" (1987) by the Cantonese
Chen Yi. Chen Yi had been inspired by the traditional songs and dances of
Guangxi Province, China, and harnessed them into a tremendous, uplifting
outburst of both power and sophistication, offering both changes of meter as
well as musical "gates" adroitly separating segments of the seven-minute
span.;    The East Coast violinist Stephanie Chase had made a forceful impact
playing "Serenade," the most platonic of Leonard Bernstein's creations.
Bernstein tied his unusually neoclassical score to Plato's "Symposium," each
of the five sections making allusions to the many faces of love.;   
Considering the theme of love, Chase's approach, like that of conductor
Falletta, was needlessly severe, meeting the considerable rhythmic obligations
with technique and virtuosity. They managed the syncopated jazzy finale well,
but more heart from all the forces, including the unusual orchestra of strings
and percussion, would have been welcome.;    Splashy ending;  Falletta closed
that concert with the splashy Mussorgsky-Ravel "Pictures at an Exhibition,"
indifferently played apart from Tony Clements' marvelously squishy tuba solo.;
   Despite able conductors and some of the most imaginative programs on the
coast, the Cabrillo Music Festival remains below its potential. The orchestra
is widely recruited -- only 30 of the 67 players are from Northern California
-- but it remains short of national-festival norms in its responsiveness,
rhythmic acuity and pitch. I have not heard a really good ensemble here,
commensurate with the festival's high national repute, since 1988.;    For
future hirings, the festival would be well advised to hold musician auditions,
even in New York City if necessary, and forget word-of-mouth from current
players, which is the commonest hiring method currently used.;  Cabrillo Music
Festival; John Adams guest conductor.; Where: Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, at
Center and Church Streets.; When: Nightly Thursdays-Sundays through Aug. 4,
plus weekend matinees. No repeat concerts.; Tickets: $15.50-$23.50. (408)
