<LEADPARA>  LIKE "Nixon in China" but in more incendiary fashion, "The Death of
Klinghoffer" transmutes contemporary history into operatic poetry.;    Unlike
the earlier work by composer John Adams, librettist Alice Goodman, director
Peter Sellars and choreographer Mark Morris, the new opera, which received its
world premiere Tuesday at the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie, needs some
refinement. But the potential for eventual triumph is there.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     After seven performances in Brussels, it will travel over the next year to
Lyons, France; Brooklyn (for its American premiere Sept. 5); Los Angeles; San
Francisco; and Glyndebourne or London, England.;    The subject of "The Death
of Klinghoffer" is the seizure of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro in
October 1985 by four Palestinian terrorists and the murder of a
wheelchair-bound American Jew, Leon Klinghoffer.;    The hatreds of Jews and
Palestinians surface here and there, sometimes violently. But the opera, laid
out in two acts of approximately 80 minutes each, deliberately cools passions
into meditations from afar.;    The action, which alternates choruses and solo
declamations, sets the events into a cosmic context inspired by Greek tragedy,
Bach's Passions and the large-scale dance-dramas of the Orient.;   
Introspective beauty;  Adams' music, conducted by Kent Nagano, incorporates
Minimalist mannerisms, neo-Romantic lyricism and sometimes pointed harmonic
acerbity. The solo narrations, like those of most modern operas, cede
principal melodic interest to the instruments. But they possess an
introspective beauty, particularly when enunciated by such sensitive singers
as James Maddalena (the Captain), Sanford Sylvan (Klinghoffer) and Sheila
Nadler (Marilyn Klinghoffer).;    More unusual than Adams' score is his blend
of conventional and electronic instruments and the amplification of all the
singers and instruments. Microphones and loudspeakers are embedded in the set
and the balances constantly modified by sound engineer Jonathan Deans. At its
best, this creates fascinating new sound-colors and invests the climaxes with
powerful energy. At its worst, it muddles and harshens the texture.;    The
production took a considerable time to gather momentum. The prologue and first
act are predominantly contemplative, except for a more animated scene of
everyday life with the Klinghoffers' friends in New Jersey.;    What was
intended as meditative and dreamy turns static and dreary. Everything in the
first act looked and sounded unsure, from the cluttered constructivism of
George Tsypin's unit set, steel girders and pipes ascending on high, to James
F. Ingalls' glaring lighting to Dunya Ramicova's stubbornly workaday
costumes.;    Sellars, his head as usual buzzing with half-realized ideas,
sought to reinforce the deliberate obfuscation of identity in the Goodman
text, in which the laments of the Palestinians and Jews sound poignantly
alike. Morris' choreography looked incongruously formalistic: neat little rows
of dancers doing their balletic turns with little sense of emotional
connection to the drama.;    Concert projections;  The second act, however,
restored one's faith in this team's creative capabilities. The use of
rock-style concert projections, expanding every intimate expression on the
protagonists' faces, enhanced the already vivid acting of Sylvan and of Eugene
Perry and Thomas Hammons as two of the terrorists.;    The opera attained its
finest depths of feeling in the two final scenes for Mrs. Klinghoffer -- the
first in which she heartbreakingly doesn't yet know that her husband has been
shot and the second a bitter denunciation of what she sees as the Captain's
complicity -- and Klinghoffer's farewell, an astonishing "aria of the fallen
body" set in the score as a slow, hypnotic dance.  </TEXT>
