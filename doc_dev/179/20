Kent Nagano, chief conductor-designate of the Halle Orchestra, has been
touring the country with his new orchestra. On Sunday they arrived home at
the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, for a concert (broadcast on Radio 3) which
was terrifically exhilarating not just in itself but for what it portends.
It was an ambitious programme  - works by Messiaen and John Adams (composers
with whose music the young American conductor has become closely associated)
which had been given their British premieres earlier on the tour, plus a
lightly glittering account of the complete Stravinsky Firebird score. All
the pieces were executed with exactly the cool confidence and flair that
have been missing in the portfolio of Halle attributes recently. Nagano, as
he told radio listeners in an interval talk, has discerned a pressing need
to re-create the quality of imagination in this orchestra's programming; it
is to this end that his opening series, under the sub-title 'New
Beginnings', has been directed.
The first half, its two offerings, each an attractive contrast with the
other, certainly proved the point. Un Sourire (1989) is the penultimate
composition to have been completed before Messiaen's death earlier this
year. It is a tiny (5-minute) marvel of 'late-music' economy and radiance.
Two strands of Messiaenic thought, the hymnally lyrical and the
birdsong-percussive, are set in block alternation, then brought to repose.
Adams, composer of Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer, approaches
his big projects with big confidence; the huge orchestra for Eldorado
(1991), including two synthesisers, wastes no colour-device. This
two-movement symphony  - self-proclaimed rather than immediately evident as
such  - treats with disquieted irony, as well as picturesqueness, two
aspects of West Coast existence.
The movements are two different sound-landscapes: the first, called 'The
Dream of Gold', builds up baleful neo-Shostakovich sonorities; the second,
'Soledades', gradually fills its empty space with tingling, desert-inspired
patterns. Adams, now firmly into his post-minimalist phase, layers his
much-repeated rhythmic and colouristic figures in the manner that appears to
draw on Baroque and various 20th-century (including rock) modes of
articulation equally: his musical language proceeds in cells of activity
forming foundation pillars to support spans of lyrical line.
The idiom is unfailingly appealing, easy to absorb. What troubles me  - here
as in the past  - is the arrival of climactic gestures produced less out of
the heat of argument than through mechanical assembly. Eldorado is a superb
concatenation of applique effects announcing itself up as something
altogether weightier.
Meanwhile, last Thursday and Friday in the Festival Hall there were also New
Beginnings  - of a rather less confidence-inducing kind. The London
Philharmonic Orchestra celebrated its newly achieved position as resident
orchestra of the London South Bank Centre with two concerts of triple-decker
form and three-hour length. If the aim of their programme was to suggest the
different kinds of promise for the future that the orchestra now holds under
its chief conductor, Franz Welser-Most, its damp-squib impact must already
be raising anxious eyebrows. To put it bluntly, the concert was either
absurdly ill-planned or all too deftly designed to demonstrate Welser-Most's
interpretative immaturity.
The centrepiece, the Schumann Second Symphony, received a glaring
performance, loveless, lumpy and driven. Unsparkling, bandmasterly accounts
of Prokofiev's Three Oranges Suite and (as encore) the Fledermaus Overture
sank spirits ever lower. The message, alas, seems to be that a highly
talented young conductor learning on the job is not well placed to lead an
orchestra many people still consider London's top-class ensemble into its
much-vaunted New Era.
