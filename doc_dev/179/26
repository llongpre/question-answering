<LEADPARA>  AMONG the face lifts created for tonight's San Francisco Symphony gala opener
is that of Davies Symphony Hall, which looks suspiciously like the cosmetic
surgery attempted unsuccessfully for San Jose's Center for the Performing
Arts.;   The symphony's black-tie concert, priced as high as $275 a ticket for
just 65 minutes of concert music (and including a post-concert party), will
feature not so much deja vu as deja entendu -- already heard.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DAVIES HALL'S NEW LOOK GETS A HEARING TONIGHT
S.F. SYMPHONY TO TRY OUT THE HIGHER RISERS  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     The most visible features of the renovation are the much higher, steeper
risers for the musicians, which acousticians Lawrence Kirkegaard &amp; Associates
also had introduced at the San Jose Symphony before Music Director George
Cleve threw them out in disgust.;   Apart from that, you may need binoculars
to spot the labors that shut down the hall for the whole summer. The
see-through overhead plastic panels have gone from round to square, each of
them on a computer-controlled winch allowing fine-tuning.;   The new acoustics
will get their baptism under fire in two weeks when London Records moves in to
record Schubert's "Great C Major" Symphony and Wagner's "Siegfried Idyll,"
with Music Director Herbert Blomstedt again on the podium.;   This week's
mostly Mozart repertory is capped by a salute to the crescendoing freedom
movement in Eastern Europe via Berlioz's rousing "Rakoczy" March for a grand
finale, commemorating a hero of the 1848 revolutions.;   The program also
offers paired treats via the coloratura-soprano vocalist, and for once Flint
Center's repeat concert (Friday night) is getting far more than a fill-in
substitute. Tonight it's the popular star Kathleen Battle, while at Flint it
will be the up-and-coming Harolyn Blackwell, making her Bay Area debut before
her "Don Giovanni" Zerlina at the San Francisco Opera later this month.;   ALL
IN THE FAMILY -- The leadership of the Bay Area's three biggest
performing-arts organizations sounds like a lunch group at the San Francisco
corporate-counseling firm of Hellman &amp; Friedman. Tully Friedman was president
of the San Francisco Opera until last year, while partner F. Warren Hellman's
sister, Nancy Hellman Bechtle, is in her fifth year as president of the San
Francisco Symphony.;   Now the likeliest heir apparent for the board
chairmanship of the San Francisco Ballet this fall is Chris (Mrs. F. Warren)
Hellman, according to sources around town.;   Says one arts board insider, "It
looks like a takeover, but it isn't, because all three of them donate very
generously to the groups.";   SANTA CRUZ PODIUM HARMONY -- Two of America's
brightest conducting stars may become a tandem in conducting the Cabrillo
Music Festival through the 1990s.;   Dennis Russell Davies and
composer-conductor John Adams are integrating their heavy international
schedules to work in Cabrillo compatibly.;   "We're talking to Dennis, he's
talking to John, and they're talking to each other," says Cabrillo Executive
Director Tom Fredericks, who is trying to firm up the Santa Cruz County-based
summer fest's conducting commitments for years to come.;   The likeliest
scenario: Davies returning to conduct in 1992. If and when Bonn resident
Davies decides to move on (and 1993 is a good guess), Adams will become the
successor.;   Meanwhile, Cabrillo wrestles with a 1991 deficit of $60,000,
piled atop the hangover $14,900 from the year before, with recession-related
contribution shortfalls blamed.;   CHANGES -- Marilyn Horne canceled her five
performances as Carmen with the San Francisco Opera because of knee surgery,
but not to worry -- two other American mezzos will replace her into the title
role. Kathleen Kuhlmann will do the opener Oct. 12 and six other performances
of the Bizet favorite, while Denyce Graves will sing Oct. 25 through Nov. 1.; 
 Before the first note of the season is sounded, the San Jose Symphony has
already changed its opening work from Mozart's "La Clemenza di Tito" Overture
to Berlioz's "Benvenuto Cellini" Overture for Sept. 13-15. The conductor,
Michael Palmer, is the latest candidate for George Cleve's job.  </TEXT>
