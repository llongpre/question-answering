<LEADPARA>  CLASSICAL MUSIC PRESENTERS are going all out for the 1991-92 season, a
development that's about the last thing one might have expected in this year
of tight budgets.;   Sergei Prokofiev turned Tolstoy's epic novel, War and
Peace, into an epic opera. San Francisco Opera's production, its first of this
spectacle opera and its homage to Prokofiev in his centenary year, had at last
count nine singers from Leningrad's Kirov Opera, brought over with the help of
star conductor Valery Gergiev. The production, scheduled to open last night,
will have just seven performances, closing Oct. 2.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Opera San Jose is mounting The Turn of the Screw, a Henry James ghost story
made deftly musical by Benjamin Britten, at the much-maligned Montgomery
Theater. Later in the season comes something I thought impossible to stage at
the Montgomery: Verdi's large-scale Un Ballo in Maschera, in a production
directed by Michael Edwards of Shakespeare/Santa Cruz.;   Das verratene Meer
(The Sea Betrayed) at San Francisco Opera is based on a Japanese novella,
Yukio Mishima's The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea. Composer Hans
Werner Henze, the leading German opera composer since Richard Strauss, will
make a rare West Coast appearance on opening night, Nov. 7.;   AT THE TOP OF
THE SYMPHONYlist is an imaginative collaboration by three Bay Area presenters,
exploring music in the turbulent transition years 1911-13 in Paris. British
conductor Simon Rattle will lead "The Rite of Spring," among other works, with
his City of Birmingham Symphony, April 24-26 at Cupertino's Flint Center,
Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall and San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall.;   At the
San Jose Symphony, guest conductors are vying for outgoing conductor George
Cleve's job, with the best resume coming from Israeli conductor Gabriel Chmura
(Nov. 15-17). In the remainder of the season, Cleve will play all four
symphonies of Brahms as well as the second piano concerto and the violin
concerto with Rudolf Firkusny and David Abel, respectively, as soloists. He'll
close his term in June with Haydn's "Farewell" Symphony and Mahler's
"Resurrection" Symphony.;   The San Francisco Symphony's enticing season
includes guest appearances by composer-conductor John Adams in the premiere of
his "El Dorado" (Nov. 13-17). Michael Tilson Thomas is back in November,
leading Charles Ives' Symphony No. 4. Among the symphony soloists, I'd
recommend soprano Jessye Norman, pianists Radu Lupu and Mitsuko Uchida, and
violinist Cho-Liang Lin.;   Among orchestras elsewhere, the Bay Area Women's
Philharmonic under JoAnn Falletta will present a premiere-studded night Feb. 1
at Zellerbach Hall. The program includes Darius Milhaud ("Le Boeuf sur le
Toit") and Libby Larsen, whose "Ghosts of an Old Ceremony," a ballet score,
will be danced by the troupe for which it was written, ODC/San Francisco.;  
In a class by itself is the superb Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra under
Nicholas McGegan. The season's pick may just be the opening concert later this
month: Handel's favorite oratorio, "Theodora," in its West Coast premiere.;  
Leading the choral offerings are the Tallis Scholars, singing early music from
MexiCo, Spain and Portugal in a March 1 concert at Berkeley's First
Congregational Church.;   In the South Bay, we look forward to the March 30-31
world premiere of Libby Larsen's "Missa Gaia" ("Mass for the Earth"),
commissioned by Schola Cantorum.;   San Jose Symphonic Choir under LeRoy G.
Kromm will present Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" April 4 and Brahms' "German
Requiem" May 30.;   Classical choruses this year are also exploring African
roots: Schola Cantorum with the "Missa Luba" on its Dec. 13-14 slate and San
Jose Symphonic Choir with its Nov. 9 concert featuring the "African Sanctus"
and Robert Ray's "Gospel Mass.";   San Francisco's renowned a cappella male
chorus Chanticleer travels southward this season. Its Christmas program -- a
certified gem -- will play the Santa Clara Mission Dec. 17 and the Carmel
Mission Dec. 18.;   IN SOUTH BAY CHAMBER MUSIC, YOU could get by remembering
just two names: Stanford String Quartet and the San Jose Chamber Music
Society. The society hosts the quartet Sept. 29 at First Unitarian Church,
where you can check out the newly reconstituted ensemble in Mozart, Elgar and
Quincy Porter.;   The society also plays host to Magnificat Oct. 13 in a
concert version of the 1624 Monteverdi rarity, "Il Combattimento di Tancredi e
Clorinda.";   Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and pianist Jeffrey Kahane top the recital
list, though their April 6 program in San Francisco's cavernous War Memorial
Opera House may be barely audible. San Francisco Performances' remaining
lineup includes pianists Evgeny Kissin (Oct. 14) and Andre Watts (March 31),
and baritone Thomas Hampson, the Met's and San Francisco Opera's newest star
(Jan. 17).;   Stanford University will play host (Oct. 11) to India's
best-known musician of the century -- Ravi Shankar, sitar -- who is a
71-year-old Los Angeles resident.;   And for a slice of history: Stanford's
computer-music studio, at its Sept. 27 Frost Amphitheater concert, will honor
Leon Theremin, 95, the Moscow resident who invented the electronic instrument
named after him -- one of the last of the grand old men of modern music.;
