Paul Driver reviews John Adams' new concerto conducted by Ken Nagano
The London Symphony Orchestra's concert under Kent Nagano at Barbican Hall
on Thursday was designed to be sizzling and balletic: Ravel's La Valse,
Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet ballet suite and the European premiere of the
Violin Concerto by the American John Adams (born 1947), a composer renowned
for heady minimalist rhythmic intensities. Nagano is a leading exponent of
Adams's work, having launched (and latterly recorded) his opera The Death of
Klinghoffer and performed many of his other pieces.
He is also a guaranteed sizzler in the concert hall. His account of Ravel's
bewitching yet brutally vivid 'choreographic poem', that strangely extrovert
threnody for the old Europe, which begins in the ballroom to end on the
battlefield, made one feel the truth of all those epithets and brought home
the sheer sonorous power of the LSO, especially in the lower and darkly
rumbling registers. No matter how dark and rumbling the sounds, they were
always precisely focussed: little curling counterpoints took on chilling
force.
Adams's concerto, written in 1993 and premiered in Minneapolis in January
(with soloist Jorja Fleezanis) is also a kind of choreographic poem, having
been jointly commissioned not only by two orchestras (Minnesota Orchestra;
LSO) but by the New York City Ballet. Adams's strict, often motoric rhythmic
manner and colourful (but often inwardly complex) imagery lend themselves
readily to dance.
His 1988 score Fearful Symmetries has been choreographed no less than six
times, most recently by Ashley Page, whose Royal Ballet version opened at
Covent Garden last week.
But it was out of the experience of opera composing, Adams writes, that the
present concerto sprang. To him it illustrates a melodic and harmonic
flexibility and a contrapuntal richness alien to the minimalist rigour of
his earlier work but called for by The Death of Klinghoffer and now the
basis of what he calls a 'post-Klinghoffer', or post-minimalist, language.
Actually, few minimalist composers besides the soporific Philip Glass have
tended to keep matters truly minimalist for long; but there is no mistaking
the opulent melodic and contrapuntal intentions of this new work, even if
the part-writing is heavily dependent on flurrying scale passages, and the
rhapsodising does not quite throw up tunes.
The orchestra used is small (double winds), but a large assortment of
percussion and a pair of synthesisers make up the odds. When the latter are
not spending time perversely imitating the harp, they contribute some novel,
ethereal effects. There are the three movements, fast-slow-fast, traditional
to a concerto: the second a gently musing and attractive Chaconne with the
curious subtitle 'Body through which the dream flows'; the third an
exceptionally lively Toccata with extra bite supplied by claves and cowbell.
The solo part, brilliantly despatched by Gidon Kremer, is full of
traditional figurations and devices. With likeable impunity and verve, Adams
has produced a virtuoso vehicle in something like the grand romantic manner.
