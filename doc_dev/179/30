<LEADPARA>  NEW classical compact discs keep tumbling out to the stores in record numbers.
Haven't those labels heard about the recession? If so, there's no sign of it
yet.;    Some of the best releases in the last month range from German
romantic music to modern works, and flamenco, too. They include the following:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Misa Flamenca," by Paco Pena (Nimbus 5288; 41 minutes) --
Guitarist-composer Pena has created a rousing and deeply felt version of the
Mass in Spanish, using the flamenco idiom of singers, guitarists and
percussion. The most remarkable facet of this new recording is the guttural
flamenco singing, as in the powerful soul-searching "Our Father." Also of
note: the "Kyrie" guitar solo by Pena, the insistent thumping of an anguished
heart in "Lamb of God" and the catchy choral singing in the "Santo.";   
Pena's work represents a new Hispanic dimension of the Catholic Mass and a new
liturgical use of timeless flamenco. One of the year's most intriguing
innovations.;    Works by U.S. composers; "American Elegies," Orchestra of St.
Luke's, John Adams, conductor (Nonesuch 979249; 48 minutes, CD) -- The keenly
sensitive renditions here of works by U.S. composers add up to an elegant and
important record.;    Sweet-voiced soprano Dawn Upshaw could make grown men
melt with her tender group of Charles Ives songs, wistfully rendered in
conductor Adams' own arrangements.;    Ives' great orchestral enigma "The
Unanswered Question" is also here, followed by Adams' similarly meandering
"Eros Music," performed by pianist Paul Crossley and the orchestra.;    San
Franciscan Ingram Marshall's environmental "Fog Tropes" includes taped marine
sounds of gaunt beauty. Here, too, are Morton Feldman's minimalist "Madame
Press Died Last Week at Ninety" and David Diamond's old-fashioned "Elegy in
Memory of Maurice Ravel.";    Anti-symphony; ANTON BRUCKNER: Symphony No. 0,
Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra, Eliahu Inbal conducting, (Teldec
2292-46330; 44 minutes) -- I have a profound weakness for Austrian composer
Bruckner, whose romanticism, built on massive organ-like chords, can be
overwhelming. Symphonically he went at least one up on Beethoven; in addition
to Bruckner's nine regularly numbered symphonies, he created the early and
little-played Symphony No. 0 in D Minor. The number was his own choice, by way
of rejecting the whole idea.;    Modern scholarship has shown its origins to
postdate the Symphony No. 1, in 1869, coming at least five years after the
date once considered valid.;    To me, it's the first minimalist symphony,
with repetitive phrases producing nearly perpetual motion.;    The recording
is dreadful, the program notes almost incomprehensible. But the piece is
monumental, the melodiousness seductive. The youthful style and conciseness
are refreshing, a whole new dimension for those knowing only later Bruckner.
But for a better zero, go for Riccardo Chailly's recording on London.;   
'Leipzig' version; ROBERT SCHUMANN: Symphonies Nos. 1, 4. Kurt Masur leads the
London Philharmonic. (Teldec 2292-46445; 56 minutes) -- Masur is on his home
turf with Schumann, propelling these works with an inexorable forcefulness, an
attention to structure and no frills.;    For the Fourth -- Schumann's last --
Leipzig resident Masur opts for the first ("Leipzig") version, perhaps out of
chauvinism but more likely in concurrence with Brahms that it was the fresher
and tighter alternative. The orchestra plays with fine attention to detail.;  
 20th-century repertory;  American Piano Sonatas, Vol. 1: Copland, Ives,
Carter, Barber, Peter Lawson, piano (Virgin Classics 7 91163; 76 minutes) --
This release is very welcome, indeed, promising a whole series on timely
20th-century repertory.;    Lawson does wonders with Ives' rhythmically
unusual "Three-Page Sonata" (1905), in some ways the most modern work in the
group. The amiable and energetic Carter Sonata -- the longest on the CD --
helps frame the well-known Barber Op. 26 showpiece and Copland's sensitive
Sonata of 1939-41.;    Sonically, this is a very attractive album. Look for
more to come. (Can we hope for an Ives "Concord" Sonata in Volume 2?)  </TEXT>
