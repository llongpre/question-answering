There's a change of direction for the Ojai Festival this year. In the past, the 
annual outdoor event has built a reputation for blending lesser-known music by 
Bach, Beethoven and other established masters with the work of cutting edge 
20th-Century personalities such as Igor Stravinsky, Pierre Boulez, Lukas Foss 
and Peter Maxwell Davies. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Mosko, the festival's new music director, plans to maintain the 
cutting-edge tradition, but add a pronounced twist. This weekend, the music of 
Frederic Rzewski, Morton Subotnick, John Adams and Elliott Carter (who will all 
attend) dominates the agenda, replacing any old and European fare with music 
exclusively new and American. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a celebration of the vitality of American music," insisted Mosko by 
telephone from the Bay Area, where he serves as music director of the San 
Francisco Contemporary Players. "The emphasis is not about being academic. It's 
more a fun festival than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Mosko (also known by his lifelong nickname, "Lucky") speaks at a rapid-fire 
pace about the return of tonality, and influences from rock and pop music that 
have helped shape the direction he is trying to emphasize. The conductor, 
composer and teacher, who was born the same year the first official Ojai 
Festival was held in 1947, has also included the works of younger composers 
such as Rand Steiger, Steven Mackey and Art Jarvinen. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any of us from my generation and younger weren't influenced 
by pop culture," Mosko observed. "And world music has also been an enormous 
influence on composers of our era. I owned my first Ravi Shankar record when I 
was 12." 
</P>
<P>
The annual weekend festival in the Ojai Valley -- 90 minutes northwest of Los 
Angeles -- will present eight concerts in three days, ranging in duration from 
one to three hours. The Ojai Festival Orchestra will be appended by two other 
performance ensembles: Mosko's San Francisco Contemporary Music Players and the 
California E.A.R. Unit. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to describe more specifically what listeners might expect, Mosko 
pointed to the 1960s and '70s, when composers began to rediscover tonality. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a feeling to get back to the immediacy that music can make," he 
explained. "Back in the 1960s when the Fluxus movement was going on, the word 
'minimalism' referred to pieces like those by La Monte Young where a cello 
would play one chord for an hour. I don't know when things got turned around 
with that word. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction by critics to what they now call 'minimalism,' or 'the new 
simplicity,' is more sociological than musical. The music simply tries to 
incorporate methods outside the longstanding European tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Mosko, who holds teaching posts at the California Institute of the Arts and 
Harvard University, has also changed his composition style since early in his 
career when outrageous avant-garde theater and music were going through a 
heyday. He defends the return of tonality in new music. 
</P>
<P>
"The myth with this type of music is that intellectualism goes away if the 
music becomes more intuitive," he said. "But if you examine the canons in Steve 
Reich's 'Desert Music' or the intricacies in the scores of John Adams or Morton 
Subotnick, the complexity is there, even if the music sounds simpler than 
something by Elliot Carter." 
</P>
<P>
Executive director Jeanette O'Conner, who has served in some capacity with the 
festival for the last 11 years, admits that the subscription rate this year is 
lower than in the past -- down 10% from last year. But she says she has no 
regrets as she leaves the Ojai Festival to become the director of development 
for Chamber Music America in New York next year. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, traditions are made to be broken," she said. "In Ojai, the locals 
have tended to view the event as crazy music plus Bach and Mozart. This year, 
the strong element will be the crazy music." 
</P>
