<LEADPARA>  THE lists of "best serious music of the 20th century" are many. But in most of
them the emphasis falls heavily on the first 50 years, and the second half
gets short shrift.;    One of the victims of such selections is Polish
composer Witold Lutoslawski, who was well received conducting his own works at
the San Francisco Symphony recently, including one I'd include on my own
best-pieces list: his "Concerto for Orchestra." (It will be performed by the
San Jose Symphony in February).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     With the century rushing toward its end, this seems to be an apt time for a
critic to present a best-works list for the second half. So here goes -- with
the hope that readers who find something else more arresting will let me know
their choices. (Most of these pieces are available on audio recordings, either
CDs or LPs.);    John Adams' "Nixon in China" is part of a new breed of opera
combining a versatile kind of minimalism with a documentary approach to plot.
The work is based on Richard Nixon's historic breakthrough in U.S.-China
relations, with Mao Tse-tung in a major role. Another Adams work -- "Phrygian
Gates," an appealing piece for solo piano -- almost makes my list, too, for
its demonstration that minimalism can be varied and virtuosic.;    Philip
Glass' "Satyagraha" is another docu-opera, dealing with Mohandas Gandhi's
early work to free the Indian masses from exploitation and discrimination.
Glass' Eastern-inspired minimalism is more doctrinaire than Adams', but it
fits the Indian theme hand-in-glove. Glass uses innovative approaches in both
his operas and concert pieces, making the electronic synthesizer a dominant
accompaniment.;    A third opera, Thea Musgrave's "Mary Queen of Scots,"
demonstrates that an honest historical opera built around a stunning lead
soprano need not revert to derivative music. Her music is fresh, vital and
mildly dissonant.;    Kzrysztof Penderecki's "St. Luke's Passion" is a
choral-orchestral work that embodies new techniques of tone clusters and
microtones to eerie, spine-tingling effect. The texts predate J.S. Bach.;   
Hans-Werner Henze's "El Cimarron," for a male singer-narrator and small
percussion-dominated ensemble, is a brilliant setting for the memoirs of a
freed Cuban slave. This piece -- one of the most memorable works done in
Spanish -- came from a German who lives in Italy.;    Luciano Berio's
"Sinfonia," from the 1960s, was a trailblazer, using the Swingle Singers
alongside the orchestra to voice evocations of Martin Luther King Jr. and
wordless song. The vocal textures are well integrated into this lengthy
orchestral work.;    Olivier Messiaen's "From the Canyons to the Stars" was
inspired by the American prairie, even though Messiaen is French. Maybe it's
an American chauvinism that draws me to this work, but I can't overlook
Messiaen's interest in bird calls, his powerful Christian bent, and his
massive canvas, all realized in music.;    Tod Machover's "Spectres Parisiens"
is the best amalgam yet of live orchestra with real-time electronic sounds --
a provocative medium whose surface has barely been scratched, even though the
technology is all in place. The impatient Machover has moved from Paris to
Cambridge, Mass., and is now composing electronic operas.;    Michael McNabb's
"DreamSong," created at Stanford University's computer-music studios in the
early 1980s, is a piece I'd take to a desert island to restore frazzled
nerves. It conjures up fantastic, restful images in its ultra-sophisticated
soundscape. I lament that the recording is out of print.;    George Crumb's
"Black Angels" was a response to the apocalyptic side of the Vietnam War. It's
a hyperactive, quote-filled string quartet, in which the players also
contribute chants, percussion and whispers. The anguish is palpable. The
string instruments are amplified in this work, perhaps presaging the quartets
of the 21st century.;    Some late symphony of Shostakovich belongs on the
list, but which? Various people will lean toward No. 10 (heard this season at
the San Jose Symphony) or No. 13 (framing the anti-persecution poem "Babi
Yar"). My own favorite, however, is Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 14.
This is an inordinately compact work, which audaciously introduced to the
Soviet Union poems from Western Europe, sung hauntingly by a soprano and a
bass over a chamber orchestra. It is to Shostakovich what the "Four Last
Songs" are to Richard Strauss, a summing up of an entire career as an artist.
A professional Bay Area performance of this work is long overdue.;    Igor
Stravinsky's "Variations" is a brief, brilliant orchestral foray into jagged
12-tone music. It comes and goes in the time it takes to cook an egg, but it
offers a lot of appealing seasoning.;    Gyorgy Ligeti's "Aventures" creates
brilliant otherworldly effects. About a half-hour of this choral work was used
for the ape sequence in the sound track of the film "2001: A Space Odyssey."
Ligeti's tone clusters are chilling and unforgettable.;    Pierre Boulez's
"Pli selon pli" (which translates roughly as "Folded Accordingly"), a work for
soprano and orchestra, is the musical pinnacle of this composer, who
epitomizes the austere, complex style dominant in the '50s and '60s. It has
been revised so often I've lost track, but its constant metamorphosis is part
of the appeal.;    Benjamin Britten's "The Turn of the Screw," a ghost opera
based on the Henry James novel, is a gem of conciseness from a master of
economy and lyricism. A close second on my list of Britten favorites is his
"War Requiem," which speaks with eloquence about the futility and profound
loss of war, while linking soldiers on opposite sides of the front through the
words of British poet Wilfred Owen, who died in World War I.;    For a variety
of reasons, other works warrant mention.;    Some are significant for their
historical importance. Among them:;    (box) Steve Reich's "Clapping Music"
and Terry Riley's "In C," for launching minimalism in the mid-1960s.;    (box)
David Del Tredici's "Alice" series of nearly a dozen big orchestral pieces,
for taking us to a comfy wonderland of rediscovered romanticism, with a
soprano whimsically voicing Lewis Carroll on a bullhorn.;    (box) George
Rochberg's String Quartet No. 3, for signaling an emphatic return to tonality
-- now the dominant style -- in the early '70s.;    Also, Morton Feldman made
a virtue of ultra-slow music; Conlon Nancarrow did incredible rhythmic
juxtapositions with hand-punched piano rolls; and Stanford's John Chowning
developed both frequency-modulated synthesized sound and a phenomenal
electronic simulation of the human voice.;    But my last choice is straight
out of Zen -- a work that comments simultaneously on others' music, on
excessive ritual, on musical theater and on the sonic overload of our age:
John Cage's "4'33," " for one or more instruments. This piece calls for
exactly four minutes and 33 seconds of silence, with the "performer"
theatrically simulating performance in any way desired.;    The 20th has been
a great, crazy, inventive century. I wouldn't trade it for any other -- except
the 21st. (box)  </TEXT>
