MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: OPERATIC LIFE AND DEATH IN BOSTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Boston now has three opera companies -- one rising, one moribund and one newly 
born -- as the historic city closes this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Newly born is Boston Opera Theater, a company established in the spring of 1989 
by some former leaders of Sarah Caldwell's still-embattled Opera Company of 
Boston, and now raising money and support for a 1990-91 season expected to 
begin in December of next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be misleading to characterize our group as just disgruntled," says 
Opera Theater executive director Robert Cannon, who at one time was president 
of Caldwell's company. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply, we felt that the time had come to establish a new and dynamic opera 
producing company to take Boston into the next century. Our assessment of the 
previous company was that it could not be reorganized." 
</P>
<P>
Among the national and international artists who will work with the new 
company, Cannon says, are stage director Peter Sellars and his artistic 
associate, Craig Smith. (In Los Angeles, Sellars declined to say more to The 
Times beyond confirming that he would be involved with Opera Theater.) 
</P>
<P>
"But this will be more than a company for Peter, who, after all, has a contract 
in Los Angeles. It will be a broad-based company with an international outlook, 
and one that will bring in important productions from the outside, as well as 
mount its own, new work. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing now is raising money and putting the pieces together. We 
expect to make a major announcement of our plans in January." 
</P>
<P>
Moribund is Caldwell's Opera Company of Boston, which has yet to announce its 
artistic plans for 1989-90, and is beset by a deficit reportedly in the 
neighborhood of $7 million. Repeated calls to the company netted no one willing 
to speak to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Rising out of academia is Boston Lyric Opera. Formerly connected with 
Northeastern University, but recently broken off from that connection, Lyric 
Opera opened its 16th season in a new theater, and with high hopes, last month. 
</P>
<P>
According to general director Justin Moss, a Californian who came to 
Massachusetts from Baltimore Opera, "We have taken a whole new direction with 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
He says two performances of Puccini's "Tosca" in September were sold out and 
artistically successful; yet to come are concert performances of Wagner's 
"Fliegende Hollander" in January and staged "Traviatas" in March. Is there room 
for three opera companies in Boston? 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely. As a theater town, for instance, Boston has audiences for 
everything. Opera is no different. We have a very educated and discerning 
population." 
</P>
<P>
JOFFREY CHANGES: Gerald Arpino, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, has 
announced the promotions of Scott Barnard to assistant artistic director and 
Barbara Forbes to ballet mistress, plus the addition of seven new dancers to 
the 1989-90 roster. 
</P>
<P>
New members are: Daniel Baudendistel, who rejoins the Joffrey after dancing 
with American Ballet Theatre and the Lar Lubovitch Company; Pascal Benichou, 
formerly of the San Francisco Ballet; Alexander Brady, formerly with the 
1988-89 Joffrey II Dancers; James Conlin, who has danced with the companies of 
San Francisco and Berkeley; Pierre Lockett, formerly of Dance Theatre of 
Harlem; Jacob Rice, who has performed with companies in Washington State, 
Connecticut and Virginia, and Amanda Smith, a member of Joffrey II Dancers from 
1987 to 1989.

<P>
