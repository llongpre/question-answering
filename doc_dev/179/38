<LEADPARA>  LOOK for the San Francisco Opera to announce the awarding of a commission to
East Bay composer Conrad Susa for an opera based on "Les Liaisons Dangereuses"
to make its debut four years from now.;   The focal role of the sexually
ravenous "virtuoso of deceit" Mme. de Merteuil -- played by Glenn Close in the
film "Dangerous Liaisons" -- will be offered to the Metropolitan Opera's star
lyric mezzo Frederica von Stade, who is moving from Long Island to the East
Bay.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Susa, 56, is an inventive composer with good credentials. His "Black River"
has been played by a number of U.S. troupes. His "Transformations" was done by
a subsidiary of the San Francisco Opera a decade ago. His "Serenade for a
Christmas Night" and "Hymns for the Amusement of Children," among other
pieces, have been recorded on both sides of the Atlantic.;   The commission
will be formally announced during the new year.;   Susa should fare better
than Hugo Weisgall. Weisgall, 79, was commissioned by the opera's General
Director Terry McEwen shortly before his departure in 1988 to write "Esther."
The commission was canceled by McEwen's successor, Lotfi Mansouri, two years
later. "Esther" which was to have played this fall, was replaced by Hans
Werner Henze's "Das verratene Meer.";   Next fall, the opera will present
another contemporary opera, John Adams' "The Death of Klinghoffer," in its
West Coast premiere.;   LIVING WITH AIDS -- Credit lyric baritone and
chamber-singer William Parker with courage. Stricken with AIDS, he continues
his singing career, as demonstrated by his performance with the San Jose
Symphony earlier this month, sounding as expressive and round-toned as ever.; 
 Faced with the diagnosis, he has stepped up his professional activity. He
recorded both tragedy-laden Bach cantatas for baritone: No. 56 ("I Want to
Carry the Cross") with the Baroque Choral Guild singers, and No. 82, ("I Have
Enough") with Nicholas McGegan conducting.;   The resulting CD will be
released as a fund-raiser by the Shanti Project, an AIDS-assistance
organization in San Francisco. All the performers and the recording company
(Harmonia Mundi, with producer Rubina Young) are donating their services.;  
Parker has also commissioned a song cycle about death from several composers,
including Lee Hoiby and Ned Rorem. It's scheduled for a January premiere in
Berlin, with Parker as soloist. A New York City performance is scheduled in
June, 1992 -- with several other baritones to help out.;   'MESSIAH' RECAST --
When the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra got to San Rafael for its "Messiah"
concert this month, Elizabeth Blumenstock dropped her violin and pitched in to
sing soprano as an on-the-spot volunteer for the choir. Only five of 13
sopranos in the UC Chamber Chorus were in good enough health to appear. The
rest were victims of the flu and cold bugs that have been devastating
performing groups this month.;   OPERA AND BALLET RESURGENCE -- A lot of
performing arts groups are hurting at the box office, especially in
subscriptions. But the San Francisco Opera went from 94 percent of capacity
attendance last fall to 97 percent this fall, with 1991 ticket sales of $12.8
million. And subscription sales were "up considerably," according to a
spokesman.;   The San Jose Cleveland Ballet also hit two records with this
year's "Nutcracker," logging new highs in single-ticket sales (15,972), which
account for more than 95 percent of the overall tickets sold, as well as
income ($338,872), for the seven performances.;   THE LONGEST-PLAYING RECORD?
-- The Marco Polo record label has announced plans to record all the works of
Havergal Brian (1876-1972), the largely self-taught British composer whose
symphonies make Mahler's look like haiku.;   Brian's 31 symphonies, several
running more than an hour in length, require huge forces, such as the 16
French horns for the Symphony No. 2, or an augmented choir for the Symphony
No. 4.;   He wrote his Symphony No. 25 in 1965, as he was approaching his 90th
birthday.  </TEXT>
