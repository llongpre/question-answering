   Congress this week celebrates a curious but
important milestone: The 200th anniversary of the days on which the
first House and first Senate achieved a quorum and were finally
ready to begin the work of the new nation.
   The House marks the occasion today, April 4, three days after
the actual April 1 anniversary. The Senate celebrates on Thursday,
April 6, the actual date of its first working quorum.
   Commemorative postage stamps will be issued honoring the
bicentennials of both houses.
   The Congress established under the Constitution first convened
in New York City on March 4, 1789.
   But the absence of the required majority plus one prevented the
two chambers from getting down to business.
   On that first day only 13 of the 59 House members and only eight
of the 22 senators were in attendance.
   Election complications, bad weather, muddy roads and just plain
sloth get the blame as causes for the delay.
   The journal of the House noted with monotonous regularity that
``a quorum of the members not being present, the House adjourned.''
   Congress under the discarded Articles of Confederation had been
noted for absenteeism and near paralysis, and many feared history
was about to repeat itself.
   ``We lose credit, spirit, everything,'' Rep. Fisher Ames of
Massachusetts wrote to a friend in Boston. ``The public will forget
the government before it is born.''
   The senators who had managed to reach New York wrote to their
absent colleagues: ``We apprehend that no arguments are necessary
to evince to you the indispensable necessity of putting the
government into immediate operation and, therefore ernestly request
that you will be so obliging as to attend as soon as possible.''
   George Washington had been elected the nation's first president,
but could not enter office until the Senate achieved a quorum and
met to count the ballots of the Electoral College.
   From Mount Vernon he grumbled that senators and House members
were in a state of ``stupor or listlessness.''
   But eventually the required numbers assembled.
   The House, counting its first quorum on April 1 _ April Fool's
Day some have noted _ elected Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg of
Pennsylvania as its first speaker.
   And Fisher Ames, much mollified now that work could begin, said
he was pleased with his new colleagues.
   While there were few ``shining geniuses,'' he said, there were
many who had ``experience, the virtues of the heart, and habits of
business.''
   On April 6 the Senate counted its first quorum.
   The first order of business: Counting the votes of the electors
and dispatching messengers to inform Washington and John Adams that
they had indeed been chosen president and vice president.

   The postage stamp honoring the Senate will display the gilt
shield and eagle suspended over the presiding officer's chair in
the Capitol's Old Senate Chamber, in use from 1810 to 1859.
   The stamp honoring the House of Representatives features the
fanciful ``Car of History,'' a winged marble chariot which, since
1819, has borne the carved figure of Clio, the muse of history,
over the floor of the Old House Chamber, now Statuary Hall.
   Rep. John Quincy Adams, who served 17 years in the House after
his single term as president, was inspired in 1840 to dedicate a
poem to the muse who is shown recording in a book the events
unfolding on the floor of the legislative body below.
   Often at odds with his colleagues and irritated by their
conduct, Adams paid tribute to the muse for putting up with the
``wordy war'' conducted by the members.
   There was wit, there was wisdom, he acknowledged. But there was
also ``the conflicting jar of ranting, raving parties, day and
night ...''
   Adams concluded:
   ``Oh! Muse historic _ in thy march sublime
   Still urging onward on the wheels of time.
   Canst thou not whisper to the chosen band
   But for one day to calm their senseless rage,
   And let thy volume bear one blessed page
   Of deeds devoted to their native land.''
