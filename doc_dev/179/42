The billing for Wednesday's concert by Music Projects/London was 'American
Counterpoints', but this really applied only to Steve Reich's ingenious
Vermont Counterpoint for one live flute and ten more on tape; and maybe, to
Colin Matthews' Hidden Variables, which is in part a mischievous send-up
(British) of American minimalism and post-minimalism.
Still, what's in a name? In this case, the official but purely notional
tie-in with the American Art show at the Royal Academy. (There may have been
people there who came expressly to match their impressions of American
abstract painting against aural Reich and John Cage, but how would one
know?) Forget the label: this was a concert full of lively imagination, from
the planning to the execution - bright, inquiring, funny and exhilarating.
Music Projects/London was set up by the conductor Richard Bernas a good
while ago. Their distinguished seniors, the London Sinfonietta, have enjoyed
more continuity of personnel; but the MP/L's track record must by now make
them the leading young challengers. In the Queen Elizabeth Hall on
Wednesday, it seemed to me - I may be wrong - that there were many more
under-25s than the norm for the pricier Sinfonietta concerts.
Yet that was not because the MP/L programme was hot-off-the-stove stuff. On
the contrary, it treated us to ancient, scatty Charles Ives, and John Cage
in his least-known period (a 1947 ballet score for Merce Cunningham, The
Seasons), along with the more recent Reich and Matthews. The ten minutes of
Reich's fresh, extremely clever multi-flute exercise were entirely justified
by Nancy Ruffer's solo playing. The Cage score finds him somewhere between
tranquil, mock-naive formalism and an active urge to scrap Western musical
paraphernalia altogether: fascinatingly dull, not just dull.
MP/L is distinguished above all for its cutting edge and its verve. In
Ives's three 'Theatre Orchestra Sets' - the fullest versions that I've
heard, carefully traced back to the first drafts - everyone in the ensemble
leapt to their opportunities, with full prompting from Bernas. Almost every
piece in these ragbag collections has a different instrumentation, anything
from a woozy wind-band to sighing strings, and each strikes sparks off some
unheard-of idea. That cornucopia of random inspirations, whether radical or
just gleefully silly, was wonderfully bracing to hear. (Some FT readers
might like to know that Ives was all his life a professional insurance man,
apparently with great actuarial breakthroughs to his credit.)
Matthews' beady-eared diatribe, which features scathing parodies of John
Adams in particular and other trendy Americans wholesale, has its own
musical sense and weight too, as the ML/P team made clear. We were hearing
the new 'chamber' version of Hidden Variables, most obviously in its reduced
strings. Aptly tacky, I thought: the budget forces focused the
implausibility of what Adams gets away with on Hollywood-scale strings.

In the Barbican Hall meanwhile, Itzhak Perlman and the London Symphony
Orchestra under Andre Previn were purveying an older, milder brand of
American music: Samuel Barber's Violin Concerto of 1940. This expert piece
of musical craftsmanship, with its curvaceous
Richard-Strauss-goes-to-New-England first movement, gently moody middle and
dashing finale, is today more liable to elicit under-praise than encourage
over-estimation.
It offers no challenge to the listener, no adventure, no threat of uncharted
emotional experience; but within their self-ordained limits its musicianly
qualities remain effortlessly graceful and delightfully fresh. Perhaps a
grander style of musical address, a riper rhetorical character was intended
by Barber than Perlman essayed in the solo-writing, or than Previn charged
from the orchestral accompaniment; but for shining sweetness and purity of
style this violinist has no equals today.
This was altogether a fine, civilised performance, and after the interval
Previn and the LSO matched it with an Elgar Second Symphony of easy flow and
sustainment of symphonic argument. Again, certain Elgarians in the audience
might have found their cravings for passionate engagement with the score's
melodic shapes unsatisfied (from Elgar's own recording of the work with the
LSO we know how high a value he set on full-bodied portamento
string-phrasing). But in its truthful, uninflated authority, Previn's
command of the symphony is now solidly impressive from first note to last.
