The Spanish savings bank 'la Caixa', based in Barcelona, supports a
diversity of concerts, including an early music festival now in its 16th
year, and has just started a contemporary music festival. Looking at once to
international celebrity and local talent, this inaugural venture featured
the music of America's senior composer Elliott Carter (86 in December) and
of the notable Barcelona-born (in 1935) and based composer, Josep Soler.
The first of the concerts I attended was given by the London Sinfonietta and
its new chief conductor Markus Stenz in the Fundacio la Caixa's Centre
Cultural. Carter's 1981 settings for tenor and ensemble of six sonnets by
Robert Lowell, In Sleep, in Thunder (a Sinfonietta commission), came across
in their marvellous intricacy with pungent force if not much tonal beauty, a
lack due not only to the acoustics but to something insistently plain-voiced
about the otherwise impressively deft singer Jon Garrison and to something
stubbornly unlyrical in Carter's nonetheless intelligent vocal writing.
Josep Soler was represented by a short neo-classical concerto for
harpsichord and five instruments which he wrote in 1969 to complement the
famous work by Falla and which the Sinfonietta recorded back in 1976. The
soloist, John Constable, conducting from the keyboard, secured a lively
account of this sweetly bristling 12-tone music, though one discovered from
next evening's concert that the taut idiom no longer reflects Soler's
approach. His Dos poemes per a orquestra (1990-93), performed by the
Orquestra simfonica de Barcelona nacional de Catalunya under Josep Pons,
proved a somewhat neo-romantic affair, the first practically a concerto for
pastoral oboe and rustling curtain of divisi muted strings with unlikely
touches from synthesised organ; the second whipping things up a bit with a
wind machine. Soler's language seems to have become dangerously eclectic,
dicing with kitsch.
The two big movements of Elliott Carter's 1965 piano concerto were complex
not in a playful but a geometrical way; a dense, often dark labyrinth. The
American Ursula Oppens was the staggeringly dauntless, highly experienced
soloist. Pons and the orchestra, with its concertino group gathered round
the piano, performed with truly admirable courage and conviction, though
never approaching an ideal balance of forces and seldom finding the ease and
confidence to animate their jaggedly expressive polyphonic lines rather than
just execute them.
Earlier in the week Oppens gave the Spanish premiere of a five-minute piano
piece, 90+, which Carter recently added to his ongoing series of luminous
little tributes to colleagues, in this case the nonagenarian Italian
composer Goffredo Petrassi. Pitched at a technical level which should not
exclude the gifted amateur, it is a perfect epitome of Carter's dazzling
metrical style and is built on 90 repetitions of the same pulsation, and
then some more, as though to wish Petrassi a few years yet of active life.
One certainly wishes Carter the same: he has just completed an orchestral
piece for next year's Proms and is at work on a voice and piano song-cycle
for next year's Aldeburgh Festival.

Russian music of very diverse character was played in two concerts on
consecutive evenings at the Royal Festival Hall by two orchestras, both
conducted by Russians. On Tuesday the Royal Philharmonic under its principal
conductor Yuri Temirkanov gave a neatly contrasted, slightly daring
programme which began with Prokofiev's Suite, Op. 33a from his 1919 opera,
The Love for Three Oranges. These six, wonderfully crisp and witty movements
were executed with panache.
Rachmaninov's three Symphonic Dances Op. 45 of 1941 were brought off well
enough but seemed all the more jadedly conservative with the concert's
marvellous middle item, the Concerto for Piano and Strings (1979) by a
living Russian, Alfred Schnittke, still echoing in the mind. This often
harshly dissonant work, Schnittke's third piano concerto, in this superbly
thoughtful, elegantly shaped, powerful account, with soloist Dmitri Alexeev,
came over as no more alienating than a darker piece by Sir Malcolm Arnold.
The music, like Arnold's, touches on jazz and the RPO's principal double
bass, Jack McCormack, plucked out his cabaret tones with style.
Though the concerto does, indeed, have its violent outbursts, they are only
some of the strangely assorted collection of musical objects - including a
quiet Moonlight Sonata-like triplet figure for piano, a near-pastiche of the
Russian Hymn from the 1812 overture, and a glissandoing string passage -
which Schnittke's apparently zany but actually ironclad argument shows to be
all of a piece. Alexeev and Temirkanov held one enthralled by the music's
sheer dialectic.
On Wednesday the BBC Symphony Orchestra under its principal guest conductor
Alexander Lazarev gave the UK premiere of the single movement Symphony No 7
(1986) by the Armenian composer Alfred Terteryan (born 1929). His music is
folk-influenced in a far from picturesque way. Here he writes an obbligato
part for the folk percussion instrument called the dap' (Timothy Darside),
which sounded not unlike the Indian tabla. This sound was often multiplied
10 or 11 times by the percussion department, or echoed by a tape recording.
A sort of musical prophecy of the Armenian earthquake of 1988, the symphony
deals wholly in monolithic and austere ritual gestures, minimalist in
material whilst maximalist in rhetorical power. A far cry from Schnittke's
irony, but a cry deserving of attention.
