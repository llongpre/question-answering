Following traditional Japanese etiquette, San Diego Symphony guest conductor 
Kazuyoshi Akiyama brought a special gift for his hosts. In Thursday evening's 
Symphony Hall concert he conducted the first local performance of Toru 
Takemitsu's "Star-Isle." The mildly astringent Impressionism of his fellow 
countryman's evocative tone poem suited the orchestra's strengths admirably, 
calling forth burnished sonic implosions from the brasses and warm, muted tones 
from the strings. This brief musical essay by Japan's premiere composer was a 
welcome present indeed.

Akiyama stimulated the players in most of the right ways, leading the orchestra 
in one of its more energetic, persuasive programs of the current season. The 
48-year-old maestro -- he is music director of the Tokyo Symphony and New 
York's Syracuse Symphony -- presided over a vibrant, yet thoroughly detailed 
performance of the Samuel Barber Piano Concerto and offered an urgent, 
extroverted interpretation of Debussy's "La Mer." 
</P>
<P>
The success of Barber's concerto was ensured by piano soloist John Browning, 
who premiered the work about 27 years ago under the composer's watchful eye. 
From his brilliant, authoritative octaves that opened the concerto, Browning 
sculpted a taut, muscular reading that left no doubt of his complete identity 
with the music. He was strong but not flashy, creating a wide spectrum of 
colors that made the piano sound almost orchestral. He was meticulous but not 
fussy, an equally apt description of Akiyama's approach to the dense, colorful 
orchestral accompaniment. Seldom has the orchestra seemed so completely engaged 
in its half of a concerto performance. 
</P>
<P>
Barber had both the good sense and the misfortune never to have been 
sufficiently avant-garde for the musical trendsetters of his day. But now that 
his music is again in vogue, and we hear it with more perspective, it is 
instructive to compare Barber with the current crop of born-again 
neo-Romantics. How many of them display even half of Barber's compositional 
craft or can shape a theme as haunting as his Piano Concerto's lavishly lyrical 
slow movement? 
</P>
<P>
If Akiyama made every moment of "La Mer" exciting and urgent, it must be noted 
that Debussy's sea is usually less turbulent under the baton of most 
conductors. It would be instructive to hear Akiyama conduct Bartok or early 
Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
Rossini's tediously sectional overture to "Semiramide" opened the concert, 
although Akiyama paced it judiciously. It seemed little more than a formality, 
curiously unrelated to the rest of the program. Tonight at 8 in Symphony Hall 
this concert will be repeated; on Sunday at 8 p.m. it will be played in Bowers 
Auditorium at Fallbrook's Potter Junior High School.
