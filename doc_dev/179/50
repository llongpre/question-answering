   Academy Award-winning director Jean-Jacques
Annaud knew what he wanted when he set out to find the lead
character for his acclaimed new movie, ``The Bear.''
   ``I was looking for a John Wayne kind of character,'' Annaud
said. His star is Bart, a 9-foot-2-inch Kodiak bear.
   ``I knew immediately Bart was the bear I was looking for because
he was very reliable, very impressive,'' Annaud said in Friday's
New York Times.
   Annaud, who won an Oscar in 1976 for ``Black and White in
Color'' and also directed ``Quest for Fire'' and ``The Name of the
Rose,'' based the new movie on a 1916 book, ``The Grizzly King,''
by James Oliver Curwood.
   He wanted to make ``a film that would be honest to animal
nature, that would be an adventure film, or thriller, in which an
animal would be the hero.''
   ``I read this novel through the eyes of the hunted, through the
eyes of the victim,'' Annaud said, who found Bart through Utah
animal trainer Doug Seus. ``I saw it was the perfect structure for
having an exciting animal story with all the good ingredients for
movie entertainment, as well as describing what is common to human
psychology and animal psychology.''

   Soccer star Diego Maradona lost some of his
prized trophies and jewels belonging to his financee when his
safety deposit box was robbed during a bank heist.
   Friday's bank robbery at the Banca di Provincia di Napoli was
carried out by a gang of 11 thieves armed with pistols, officials
said. The group entered the bank through a sewer system which runs
underneath the building.
   The robbers held bank employees hostage while cash tills and
safety deposit boxes, including two belonging to Maradona, were
emptied.
   Maradona's friends confirmed that the boxes included some of his
prized soccer trophies _ including the Golden Football presented to
him three years ago by France Football _ and jewels belonging to
his fiancee, Claudia Villafane.
   But they declined to confirm reports estimating Maradona's loss
at nearly $720,000.
   Maradona reportedly was philosophical about the theft, saying,
``A bad day, but the important thing is we're all in good health.''
   Also Friday, the Argentine soccer star of Naples was fined
$7,200 by the Italian soccer tribunal for criticizing a referee
following a championship match.

   Country singer Lionel Cartwright says he
got his start ``out in the sticks'' in West Virginia playing at PTA
meetings and 4-H shows.
   ``I started from the bottom up,'' said Cartwright, who's been
performing for 19 of his 29 years. ``I remember playing at a PTA
meeting that was so far out in the sticks (that) we drove for miles
and when we got there there were about 10 people there.
   ``I played at 4-H shows and civic things and church things,'' he
said. ``I did `Mountain Dew' and `Okie From Muskogee' and a lot of
old country songs.
   ``I never was one to go out and do the latest hits. I liked to
find the album cut or the obscure thing that no one else was doing.
That leads you to try your hand at writing.''
   He wrote ``Give Me His Last Chance,'' climbed to No. 2 on the
country charts last month.

   American composer and conductor John
Harbison, who won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1987, was
appointed creative chairman of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.
   Harbison, who won the Pulitzer for his cantata ``The Flight into
Egypt,'' will replace John Adams for the 1990-91 season, officials
announced at the orchestra's annual meeting Friday.
   Adams, whose initial appointment of one year in 1988 was
extended through this season, said he was relinquishing his
position to work on other projects.
   Adams said he wants to complete his opera, ``The Death of
Klinghoffer,'' about the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro.
   Harbison, 50, will share artistic oversight of the orchestra
with music director Christopher Hogwood and principal conductor
Hugh Wolff.
   Harbison, from Orange, N.J., studied at Harvard, Princeton and
the Berlin Hochschule fur Musik. In 1969, he joined the faculty of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served as
composer-in-residence for the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1982 to
1984, and for the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1985 to 1988.
