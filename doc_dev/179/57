"Nixon in China" is not much of a conductor's opera, but all those who have had 
a turn with it have seemed able to impart a distinctive character. Certainly 
Randall Behr did so Saturday evening, when the piece returned to the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion after a 13-day layoff.

Behr, Music Center Opera's resident conductor, stressed the lyrical aspects of 
the lush score, leading a suave, rounded performance that retained the clear 
textures and vitality instilled by his predecessor in this run, Kent Nagano. 
Behr also brought out the dance-based, vernacular rhythms, in a gracefully 
swinging account that provided scope for explosive contrasts.

<P>
The reinforced Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra played with cohesive, stylish 
aplomb for Behr, momentary lapses at the end of Act I and the beginning of the 
ballet notwithstanding. This is a very persuasive orchestra for composer John 
Adams -- its luminous "Shaker Loops" still glows in some memories -- and it 
makes much of its manifold opportunities here.

<P>
Some amplification inconsistencies skewed balances for the voices, both the 
established solo cast and the Music Center Opera Chorus, but otherwise the 
performance retained its now-familiar vocal character.
