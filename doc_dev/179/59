Eccentrically, since this seems to be their 21st season, Richard Hickox and
his City of London Sinfonia are still celebrating their '20th Anniversary
Season'. They still have the T-shirts on sale, which may explain it. The
'Plus', this past weekend, was for a lot of enthusiastically planned
'collective composition' and 'workshops' during the days, with
schoolchildren involved, besides three full-dress concerts later - mostly of
recent British music - with substantial Arts Council support. The whole
event may have been a great tonic for everybody concerned; I heard only the
final concert, and found it slightly dispiriting.
Not because of the Sinfonia's playing; that was generally expert and full of
verve. Two pieces showed off the Sinfonia strings by themselves. The
American John Adams' Shaker Loops is 13 years old, lightly poised between
minimalism and post-minimalism. The fiddle-patterns of Shaker music sizzle
away for 25 minutes like a bright, unambitious exercise, or very superior
Muzak. Though the programme-note made much of the 'loops' - overlapping
melodic cycles of different lengths - it discussed only the original version
for string septet; with the much larger band Hickox used here, the
asymmetries barely registered.
Barry Guy's new After the Rain, inspired by a well-known Max Ernst painting
('Europe after the Rain'), alternated between busy atonal 'refrains' and
more sedate stuff - banal 19th-century chorale (with heartfelt delivery), a
fair imitation of Britten's super-diatonic string-writing in a 'Chanson',
some raw melodramatic effects: it comes to nothing much. Nigel Osborne's
Flute Concerto, a year-and-a-half younger than the slick Adams piece, made a
familiar Osbornian impression: musical ideas of tantalising potential,
developed too laconically and obliquely to make any decisive effect. Duke
Dobing sounded like a committed soloist, and at least looked like one when
the instrumental balance left him all but inaudible.
Peter Wiegold's new Sinfonia Concertante was specifically a fruit of this
weekend, with seven of its eight movements designed for filling-out by solo
players whose parts were partly sketched in 'workshops' earlier, partly
improvised on the spot. A progress from Daybreak ('primitive, unformed') to
Night 2 ('healing power of the dark') was fixed by Wiegold's prior scenario.
The CLS soloists played up bravely, with much imagination; the pre-set
orchestral shell failed, however, to ensure any telling overall shape. Most
of the 'day' ambled jauntily along like the donkey-movement in Grofe's
'Grand Canyon' Suite - remember that? Wiegold does - and the outer sections
achieved no more than film-music Affekt, even looser than the Kitsch
postcard-sequence of Strauss's 'Alpine Symphony'. Surely we ought to applaud
Wiegold's aim of re-enlisting individual flights of fancy into live
'classical' music; but there must be tougher-minded ways of building them
into a continuous half-hour structure.
