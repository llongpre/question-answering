noisy, angry, well meaning music and has to cover his ears

According to a recent survey by the American Symphony Orchestra League,
covering five years of programmes by the leading orchestras, John Adams (the
composer of the operas Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer) is the
living American composer most often played. Kurt Masur began his
directorship of the New York Philharmonic with Adams's Short Ride in a Fast
Machine and Tromba Lontana, two short works, one loud and one soft. El
Dorado, Adams's latest orchestra piece, was given its premiere recently by
the San Francisco Symphony, which commissioned it. It's about 'the greed of
the eighties', we are told, with a first movement, angry and violent, that
is 'my own response to the Gulf War'.
I've not heard El Dorado, but last month in New York there were two
symphonies containing much angry, noisy music. John Corigliano's First
Symphony was inspired by the sight of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, those
thousands of commemorative panels for those who have died. Each movement
recalls a lost musician friend. The first, 'Of Rage and Remembrance', begins
'ferociously' and includes pages on end of slashing chords marked 'tutti as
loud as possible', but in a quiet episode a distant piano is heard playing
the Albeniz Tango, a favourite piece of the pianist friend remembered.
The central movement, a Tarantella, recalls a friend in the music business,
famed for his wit, who became mad; a trivial tarantella tune is put through
increasingly horrible distortions. Corigliano found the motto theme of the
finale, 'Giulio's Song', while listening to 30-year-old tapes of himself and
a cellist friend improvising. Played by a solo cello, it begins with the
whole-tone ascent that in Berg's Violin Concerto spells 'Es ist genug'.
Other themes join it; in the score they are named, and the names are those
of musician friends who have died. The music mounts to a battering funeral
march, with the clash and clamour of bells; in a quiet coda earlier themes
are recalled.
The work was commissioned by the Chicago Symphony, which gave the first
performance, under Barenboim. It was recorded (Erato); the disc has stayed
for months in Billboard's Classical Top Ten; Corigliano won the Grawemeyer
Award, music's 'Nobel Prize'. (Birtwistle, for The Mask of Orpheus; Ligeti,
for the piano Preludes; and Chinary Ung, for Spiral, were earlier winners.)
At the New York premiere, which was given by the Philharmonic under Leonard
Slatkin, panels of the Quilt hung in the lobby of Fisher Hall, and the
audience was invited to inscribe the names of dead loved ones on a new
panel. The emotional charge was high. The critic must steel his heart to say
that, for all the pain and grief and love that it expresses, the musical
means of expression are undistinguished, conventional, obvious. The New York
Times went so far as to call the result 'vulgar'.
Aaron Jay Kernis's Second Symphony, which was given its first performance by
the New Jersey Symphony under Hugh Wolff, addresses even more 'the endless
violence of the Gulf War, the subtle and unsubtle encroachment upon women's
and minority rights, the hovering threat of censorship of artists along with
the economic, social, and medical disasters that plague us daily'. Adams is
45, Corigliano is 54; Kernis is a younger composer, born in 1960, who has
become very prominent. He wrote some good, exuberantly inventive works in
his youth: Dream of the Morning Sky (1983), for soprano and orchestra; Love
Scenes (1987), for soprano (Dawn Upshaw) and cello. But now, as work after
work after work pours out, he seems content to press the conventional
response triggers.
His first symphony, Symphony in Waves, had its premiere earlier this season
from the New York Chamber Symphony, and has been recorded. It included
Adams-like passages of minimalism. The movements of the Second Symphony are
entitled 'Alarm' 'Air/Ground', and 'Barricade'. The first, marked
'aggressively', contains wave upon wave of noisy climax underpinned by
ostinato. In the second, simple melodies wander over 'grounded' harmonies.
While writing the third, Kernis says, 'a recurring image was the building
full of innocent Iraqi civilians under siege which was mistakenly bombed and
obliterated nearly a year ago'; it ends with the loudest noise I have ever
heard in a concert hall - four tam-tams whacked 'at maximum volume' for five
long seconds. Audience and orchestra players covered their ears.
Crash-bang - alternating (but not always) with episodes soft, sentimental,
and soupy - has become the mode of the successful American orchestra works
taken up in city after city. Del Tredici's Alice screams at the top of her
voice; he himself describes his Steps, composed for the Philharmonic, as
'violent and raucous . . . clattering . . . Godzilla battling Megalon'. This
is music for people already half-deafened, responsive only to high-decibel
assault. And he is not the only composer who writes it.
Poster-art is in vogue. American orchestras (and their conductors) -
shunning Carter, Sessions, Wuorinen - embrace it. When not strident, it's
'nostalgic'. In the programme that brought the Kernis, there was a 'new'
Flute Concerto, by Joseph Turrin, in sub-Prokofiev vein. In the Philharmonic
programme after the one that brought the Corigliano, Slatkin championed
Claude Baker's Shadows, a 'Japanese' piece such as many composers have
written: a flower arrangement of exquisite sounds - scratch, patter, tinkle
and ting - based on four haiku but also (with full acknowledgement and
near-quotation) on movements by Mahler, Britten, and Stravinsky. Dainty
working, no harm it in at all - and no sustenance. We might as well have
been listening to Takemitsu.
