<TEXT>
   Richard Croxton Adams, who invented the
paint roller to help America adapt to a World War II shortage of
brushes, died at the age of 76.
   Adams, a descendant of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy
Adams, suffered a stroke last week and died Wednesday in Grossmont
hospital, said his wife, Mary.
   An engineer, industrialist and civic leader, Adams invented and
held the first patent on the paint roller. He developed it in his
basement workshop while working in the market research department
of the Sherwin-Williams Paint Co. in 1940.
   The invention was spurred by a shortage of paint brushes caused
by World War II, then raging in Europe.
   At the time of his death, Adams was working with a group of
Southern California educators to establish a research center where
academicians could study biological and sociological issues.
   In addition to his wife, Adams is survived by three sons, a
brother and eight grandchildren.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Monday.
