<LEADPARA>  MOZART rival Antonio Salieri is coming to San Francisco on Thursday and Friday
to defend himself against the allegations, popularized in the play and film
"Amadeus," that he did away with Wolfgang by poison.;    Epithets, staff notes
and staccatos will be flying before he leaves.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The Trial of Salieri" will play on the stage of Davies Symphony Hall at
7:30 p.m., prior to the all-Mozart San Francisco Symphony concerts led by
Roger Norrington.;    Salieri may have a reversal of fortune, so to speak,
when Melvin Belli takes the bench Thursday and hears legal arguments pro and
con.;    Scott Beach will narrate. If you look closely at Salieri, he may look
a lot like A.C.T.'s Peter Donat. Another cast will be called to order for
Friday's none-too-serious trial and tribulation.;     EXIT FROM THE
CONSERVATORY -- The San Francisco Conservatory of Music is mum on the dispute
leading to the abrupt departure of its highly regarded president, Stephen
Brown, 39, who had been in office exactly one year.;     "He has left,"
confirmed spokeswoman Deborah Ribovich. "I don't know if the board (of
trustees) has asked for his resignation.";    Board chairman Michael J. Savage
said that Brown indicated that he would submit his resignation to pursue other
interests. Brown was unavailable for comment.;    Despite cancellation of the
conservatory's annual Chamber Music West festival after the current one ends
Saturday, Savage insists, "There is no financial crisis." He points to the
recent completion of the $6.5 million fund-raising campaign.;    Speculation
runs that Brown's heart still lies in the performing arts. Previously he had
been with the Lyric Opera of Chicago.;     COMPOSERS, COMPOSERS -- Four
Californians and an Alaskan -- two of them recent Stanford products -- won out
over 60 entrants for symphonic performances at the Cabrillo Music Festival
July 27 in Santa Cruz.;    The new-music concert will present the world
premiere of Stefan Carow's "Five Pieces for Orchestra," John Luther Adams'
"Far Country of Sleep" and Allen Shearer's "Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra.";
   Also included are works by two ex-Stanfordites, Ross Bauer's "Neon" and
David Jaffe's "Whoop for Your Life.";     A STRANGE SCORE -- In the South Bay,
San Jose State composer Allen Strange has completed a 16-minute scene of his
New-World opera commissioned by Opera San Jose, "Popol Vuh." It deals with
stories in an ancient Mayan codex, but the score is late-model computer
music.;    The "Popol Vuh" excerpt is now being prepared for a workshop
performance for funders and board members in July or August, says Opera San
Jose Executive Director Craig Palmer.;     WOMEN IN MUSIC -- Aida Mechetti was
overlooked in the advance publicity about her husband, last weekend's San Jose
Symphony guest conductor Fabio Mechetti. But all that changed quickly when the
stunning pianist turned up in the audience at his concerts. On occasion, the
Mechettis will team up on a piano concerto.;    Misunderstanding of a question
had apparently led to Mechetti's stating he was unmarried in his preconcert
interview.;     MOZART, EVER MOZART -- To get a glimpse of the sur-titles in a
Mozart opera apparently commands a huge premium. The San Francisco Opera this
month gave a 44 percent discount for subscriber tickets in parts of the
orchestra where the sur-title translations could not be seen.;    One slice of
Mozart is getting a long look in August at Oakland's Mills College.
Twenty-five piano concertos will be played in sequence, Aug. 22-24, on
harpsichord, fortepiano and grand piano, with at least 20 different Bay Area
pianists and a bevy of conductors over the eight-concert span.;    "I intend
these concerts to be free," says producer Charles Shere, who dreamed up the
fascinating idea.;    Margaret Fabrizio of Stanford University will play the
first and last (No. 27) concertos of this classical crescendo.;     SOME
SUMMER FESTS TO KEEP IN MIND -- Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma, which boasts
that it is the state's oldest, plays host to Branford Marsalis, Lionel
Hampton, Dave Brubeck and the MJQ outdoors June 22-Sept. 8. There are picnic
possibilities, too. For information, call (800) 273-4416.;   
"Composer-to-Composer" at the Telluride Institute in Telluride, Colo., July
11-14 offers a long weekend of discussion, demonstration and performance by
name composers such as Alan Hovhaness, Paul Dresher, Holland's Louis
Andriessen, Janice Giteck, and performers from India, Brazil, Argentina. Call
(303) 728-4402.;    The Britt Festivals in Jacksonville, Ore., June 21-Sept.
1, offer folk, pop, country, jazz and even a musical, "Little Shop of
Horrors." The classical orchestral lineup is headed by James De Preist and
JoAnne Falletta on the podium, with soloists such as Christopher Parkening.
