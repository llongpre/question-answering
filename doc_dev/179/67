   The atonal music of Arnold Schoenberg may be as
difficult to listen to as any composed in the 20th century.
   The New York City Opera charged into its challenges and Saturday
night gave the New York premiere of his two-act 1932 opera ``Moses
und Aron,'' which had its American premiere in Boston in 1966. The
opera will be heard five more times this season.
   The production, originally developed for the Cologne Opera in
1978, is brilliantly done.
   The music, powerful but not attractive to the ear, is propelled
by rhythm. Because it doesn't follow a musical line, it's harder to
listen to than Berg's ``Lulu'' or ``Wozzeck.''
   Nonetheless, the orchestra, conducted by Christopher Keene, and
singers sounded splendid. They obviously had worked long and hard
on the complex music. The production is imaginitively lighted. All
scenes are viewed as though in a dusk that makes images fuzzy.
Chorus men wore suits made like prison issue and women wore dresses
resembling waitress uniforms, all - from shoes through face and
hair - the grim color of white clay. Spotlights on the floor
sometimes created tall shadows on the back wall.
   Thomas Young was Aron. This year he will also sing in John
Adams' new opera, ``The Death of Klinghoffer.'' Richard Cross was a
bearded, white-haired Moses, whose part is performed mainly in
``sprechstimme,'' or speaking to music.
   In the opera, Moses isn't a fluent speaker; God has chosen his
brother Aron to be his spokesman.
   The two are constantly in spiritual conflict. Moses has Aron
explain the unimaginable God to the Israelites and they say hey
need something visible. Aron makes Moses' staff become a snake. The
Israelites decide God is strong if he has such mighty servants and
they'll follow Moses out of Israel.
   In Act 2, the Israelites are in the wilderness, frustrated and
about to riot because Moses has been gone so long, receiving the 10
Commandments. Aron says they can have their old gods back, collects
gold and exhibits a beautiful little golden calf on a pedestal, lit
by spotlights of changing colors. In the longest scene, there is
dancing, a ritual sacrifice to the calf and an orgy.
   The opera ends soon after Moses returns with tablets. He raises
his hand, the golden calf falls and its pedestal disappears. He and
Aron argue again, Aron saying the people need something concrete as
well as an idea and Moses lamenting his inability to explain the
invisible God to them himself.
   Schoenberg, who died in 1951, intended to write a third act but
never did.
   The program is the New York City Opera debut for director Hans
Neugebauer, set and costume designer Achim Freyer and lighting
designer Hans Toelstede. For Freyer, it's also his American debut.
