   Winning a Grammy Award was not that
exciting, says John Adams, who won in the contemporary classical
composition category for his opera, ``Nixon in China.''
   ``I'm not excited about (winning) ... because it's an industry
award meant to hype rock'n'roll,'' Adams, creative chair of the St.
Paul Chamber Orchestra, said Wednesday night.
   ``In the classical field, the awards are given unimaginatively.
It's high name recognition; (Sir Georg) Solti wins all the time,''
he said. ``In the past I lost to Vladimir Horowitz and Andrew Lloyd
Webber. I guess old Dick Nixon carried me over the top.''
   Adams' opera is about President Nixon's historic 1972 trip to
China.
   He attributed his victory, in part, to the fact that his opera
received widespread media coverage, a presentation on public
television and had Nixon's name in the title.
