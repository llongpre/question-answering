MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: PERLMAN, CLOSE TO HOST OVATION AWARDS

Itzhak Perlman and Glenn Close will host the third annual Ovation Awards -- 
honoring current recordings of classical music and the performers who make them 
-- at Carnegie Hall in New York City Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The awards show will be taped for later broadcast on radio and television, 
according to Sharon Dec, coordinator of the awards for Ovation magazine. In 
1988, the awards program was shown on cable (Arts &amp; Entertainment). This 
year, Dec says, the management is seeking sponsors for network distribution. 
</P>
<P>
With awards scheduled in 14 categories, voting by a 250-member panel made up of 
music professionals and Ovation readers, begins this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The voting, in a window of time between Saturday and Aug. 15," says Dec, "is 
by a computerized telephone system. The voters have an access code as a group, 
and each one has another, individual access code. After each participant has 
voted, the separate code will be destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
The voters fall into two groups. The first, which Dec refers to as the 
"credentialed group," comprises 125 professionals -- music critics from 
newspapers and magazines, professional record buyers from retail outlets and 
program directors from classical music radio stations. This group's votes are 
"weighted two to one," Dec says, against the votes of the second group of 125 
music-lovers who are subscribers to Ovation magazine. 
</P>
<P>
None of the names of the voters can be revealed, another spokesman for the 
awards show told The Times last week. This in accordance with the rules laid 
down by the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, which will tabulate the 
results and keep them secret until the Oct. 26 event. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination procedure, according to Dec, was this: More than 55 record 
companies submitted more than 300 recordings for consideration. A panel of six 
judges from the national music community -- Robert Conrad, Dave Conant, Israel 
Horowitz, Denise Pineau, Paul Turok and John von Rhein -- listened to these 
recordings and submitted their rankings. From these, the list of competitors in 
14 categories was made up. 
</P>
<P>
What each of the 14 winners -- plus 11 recipients of special, uncategorized 
awards -- will take home is a silver sculpture designed by Vivianne Bulow-Hube 
of Georg Jensen Silversmiths.
