at the orchestra's home, Davies Symphony Hall, will cause disruptions at
season's end.;    Because of the Davies reconstruction, the symphony will move
into the Civic Auditorium during its last two subscription weeks (May 20-29,

<TEXT>     "That is why we want to give the Verdi 'Requiem' then -- it's the place for
a big sound," explained Music Director Herbert Blomstedt yesterday from his
home in Lucerne, Switzerland.;    Recording postponed;    The annual May
recordings with London Records will have to be postponed until fall 1992. And
for one week in May the orchestra will be silent, right after its three-week
Asian tour.;    Blomstedt will be on the podium for 15 instead of the usual 16
weeks because of that May week without programs. Three of his weeks on the
podium will be during the Asian tour.;    The ambitious program, Blomstedt
says, serves his goal "to give everybody a new and fresh experience" in the
concert hall.;    Some highlights:;    (box) The season opens with a gala
Sept. 4 at Davies, with coloratura soprano Kathleen Battle singing Richard
Strauss and works by Mozart and Berlioz.;    (box) Guest conductor David
Zinman, who is looking more and more like a fixture here, will return for two
weeks. Other guest conductors include Roger Norrington, Eduardo Mata, Christof
Perick, composer John Adams, Iona Brown, Michael Tilson Thomas, Kent Nagano,
John Nelson, Neal Stulberg and Silvain Cambreling. Conducting during two weeks
of subscription concerts, each, are Semyon Bychkov, Gunther Herbig and
Alasdair Neale.;    (box) Bay Area audiences will hear the large-scale Charles
Ives Symphony No. 4. This American answer to Mahler's symphonies, which dates
back to the World War I era, will be given under Michael Tilson Thomas, Nov.
20-23, with the symphony chorus.;    (box) John Adams' podium week Nov. 13-16
will feature the commissioned world premiere of his own "El Dorado.";    (box)
Other commissioned world premieres include New York composer Charles
Wuorinen's 35-minute-long "Genesis" on Christian texts, written for chorus and
orchestra, and San Francisco composer Wayne Peterson's "The Face of Night, the
Heart of the Dark.";    (box) Other music by living composers includes various
pieces by Henri Dutilleux, Christopher Rouse's "Iscariot," Alfred Schnittke's
"(K)ein Sommernachtstraum," Joan Tower's "Sequoia," George Perle's "Dance
Fantasy" and excerpts from Sir Michael Tippett's "The Midsummer Marriage.";   
(box) Other unusual repertoire features a program consisting entirely of
Manuel de Falla's music, with "Homenajes" and the opera "La Vida Breve";
Stravinsky's complete "Pulcinella," with voices; Honegger's "Christmas
Cantata"; Barber's Cello Concerto; Corigliano's Symphony No. 1; and Francaix's
"The Flower Clock.";    (box) The recording repertory next season with London
Records is not all traditional either, with Schubert's "Great C Major"
Symphony (No. 9), Wagner's "Siegfried Idyll," Franz Berwald's "Symphonie
Serieuse," Schubert's Overture in the Italian Style, and Strauss' tone poem
"Ein Heldenleben" on the agenda.;    (box) Performances of Berlioz'
vocal-dramatic symphony "Romeo et Juliette," under Roger Norrington.;    (box)
Star soloists include pianists Mitsuko Uchida, Horacio Gutierrez, Garrick

Pollini; the Soviet Philharmonic under Gennady Rozhdestvensky; the Cleveland

Waart; and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields.;    (box) The violinists
Itzhak Perlman and Isaac Stern will be back for their near-annual
appearances.;    (box) The symphony will also present the Joffrey Ballet
again, June 29-July 12, 1992.  </TEXT>
