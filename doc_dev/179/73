<P>
Like the rest of us, our Presidents are diverse. They are the children of the 
wealthy and educated, the children of the poor. They were born on historic 
plantations on the river banks of Virginia, in modest wood-frame homes on the 
Midwestern plain, on ranches in Texas cattle country. They are the sons of 
ministers, of farmers, of land barons, of laborers. 
</P>
<P>
And some of the homes where they were born are open to the public. To visit 
those homes is to be reminded of several things: Of our right to travel to 
those homes. Of our right to aspire to their position. Of their origins, which 
often were humble. Of our right to elect the leaders of our choice. 
</P>
<P>
When our nation was born on the Fourth of July, so were our opportunities. 
Let's celebrate with a quiz on some lesser-known facts about our Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Which two Presidents died on the same day -- July 4, 1826? 
</P>
<P>
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Which state produced the President who held office for only one day? 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky. David Rice Atchison, born in Frogtown, Aug. 11, 1807, who, as 
president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, effectively became leader of our 
nation for one day -- March 4, 1849, when President-elect Zachary Taylor, a 
staunchly religious man, refused to take office on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Which President's birthplace is claimed by two states? 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Jackson, born March 15, 1767, in Waxhaw settlement on the farm of his 
aunt near the North Carolina/South Carolina border, but before the border was 
drawn. North Carolina commemorates its favorite son with a highway marker about 
20 miles south of Charlotte. South Carolina celebrates its home-grown president 
with Andrew Jackson State Park on U.S. 521, north of Lancaster. The park 
features a picnic area, nature trail, camping and fishing facilities and a 
one-room schoolhouse and museum that contain artifacts of the period and the 
area. Call (803) 285-3344. 
</P>
<P>
What is placed in a time capsule beneath the site of Gerald Ford's Omaha 
birthplace? 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, during the Bicentennial, officials planted a time capsule beneath the 
President Gerald R. Ford Birthsite &amp; Gardens in Omaha. It contained, among 
other things, a six-pack of Falstaff beer, sealed but empty. In addition, it 
contained a football, a plastic telephone showing how the parts work, two 
manikins depicting 1976-era dress and income tax information from the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Who was the only President to be married in the White House? 
</P>
<P>
Grover Cleveland, who in June 1886 married 21-year-old Frances Folsom, 
Cleveland's ward since her father died in 1875. Her father had been one of 
Cleveland's law partners. 
</P>
<P>
What profession did the fathers of Presidents Grover Cleveland and Woodrow 
Wilson share? 
</P>
<P>
Both were Presbyterian ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Which birthplace is on land still inhabited by a late President's widow? 
</P>
<P>
The L.B.J. birth site, at the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park near 
Johnson City, Tex., is on the ranch where Lady Bird Johnson sometimes resides. 
</P>
<P>
Which state is birthplace of eight Presidents and the final resting place of 
seven? 
</P>

James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor 
and Woodrow Wilson. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Tyler, William 
Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy all are buried in Virginia.

Benjamin Harrison) was born on Berkeley plantation in Virginia. That is where 
"Taps" was composed in 1862 while Union Forces were encamped there during the 
Civil War, and where the first bourbon whiskey in America was distilled in 
1621. 
</P>
<P>
On what date was the Declaration of Independence formally adopted by the Second 
Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia?

If you don't know the answer to this, ask any grade-school child. (Penalty for 
an incorrect answer is that you must go to work on Tuesday.) 
</P>
<P>
As a reward for successfully completing this quiz, here are a few Presidential 
birthplaces to visit at your leisure. They also are a reminder of how we began 
and who we have become. 
</P>

County. The original house burned in 1779. A memorial house was reconstructed 
on the site. A Colonial farm, kitchen and workshop also help show a typical 
plantation. The land is tilled by oxen and the crops are the same as those 
planted during Washington's childhood. Washington's great-grandfather, 
grandfather and father are all buried there, about 38 miles east of 
Fredericksburg, Va., near the Potomac River. Call (804) 224-1732.

cabin, which has been reconstructed on the original site, is now housed in a 
stately granite memorial. At the time the family lived there, Lincoln's father 
was a farmer. The family owned 348 acres, but probably only farmed a few acres 
at a time. The family of four, including Lincoln's parents and one sister, 
lived in the cabin until Lincoln was 2 1/2 years old. The visitor center 
contains a family Bible with Lincoln's name written in it. Three miles south of

items and pieces owned by the family. Of interest are a pair of boots and a 
leather chest, both made by Grant's father, who was a tanner. In 1890 the house 
was taken on a tour of the United States (either on a river boat traveling by 
waterways or by railroad flat car) so that the public could see it. The house 
later was returned to its original foundation, about 27 miles southeast of 
Cincinnati in the Clermont County village of Point Pleasant off Ohio 52. The

the banks of the Pedernales River in Gillespie County, Tex., about 15 miles 
west of Johnson City, in the Hill Country of south-central Texas. A 
reconstruction of the original farmhouse sits on the original site, rebuilt by 
Johnson in 1964. The Johnsons planned it to serve as a guest house for visitors 
to the LBJ ranch, but rarely used it as such. Because Lady Bird Johnson still, 
at times, lives on the ranch, the birth site is accessible only by a bus tour 
of the LBJ ranch at Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park. The park, which 
also houses the Texas White House and the Johnson Family Cemetery, is open 
daily (except Christmas) from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Call (512) 868-7128 or (512)

museum and archives. Furnishings and mementos from the original home have been 
preserved for use in the museum. Target date for opening the home is July, 
1990. Although it is not possible to get on the grounds, it is possible to 
catch a glimpse of the farm on the corner of Eureka and Yorba Linda boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald R. Ford (38th President): Born July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Neb. The house 
Ford was born in was destroyed by fire in 1971. In 1977 the site was bought and 
developed into a memorial. It houses a fountain and the Betty Ford Rose Garden. 
The original home was built in 1893 for $10,000, a high price for that period. 
When Ford was just a few weeks old, his mother separated from his father, 
Leslie King Sr., who was a well-to-do businessman. They divorced and his mother 
eventually moved to Grand Rapids, Mich., where she married Gerald R. Ford, who 
adopted Ford and changed his name from Leslie King Jr. The memorial, at 3200 
Woolworth Ave., is open daily, 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.
