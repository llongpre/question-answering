UNTIL recently the European map was spattered with festivals of modern
music; now they are becoming harder to find.
London's distinguished Almeida Festival has all but disappeared, Royan and
La Rochelle have gone, Metz has shrunk to a weekend, and the Venice Biennale
is troubled. But Strasbourg's 'international festival of the musics of
today', Musica, continues to shine as an example of enlightened underwriting
and energetic open-minded programming. With a budget of more than four times
(c. Pounds 800,000) that of its nearest British equivalent, the Huddersfield
Festival, Musica can afford to run for 16 days, fill them with some 60
events, take heady risks and make bold gestures. Its money comes from
copious sponsorship and hefty local and national subsidies.
Musica was founded on a central government directive in 1983, Maurice
Fleuret, himself an ex-festival director (Lille), being the instrumental
bureaucrat. This year's festival, directed by Jean-Dominique Marco with the
assistance of Marc Dondey, was the triumphant tenth, opening with a heady
risk - a choral-orchestral concert devoted to the music of that Italian
maverick Giacinto Scelsi - and ending with what would have been the boldest
of gestures, the first French performance of Tippett's evening-long
'oratorio' The Mask of Time, had there not been a decisive problem with the
Polish choir involved. The French premiere of the same composer's third
symphony (1972) took place instead - still a pretty bold undertaking; but as
played by the Orchestre Philharmonique de la Radio Television Belge
Neerlandophone under Nicholas Cleobury, with soprano soloist Penelope
Walmsley-Clark, it proved a success.
Tippett's and other modern British music formed an important strand of this
festival (the British Council weighed in with support). I arrived at Musica
too late for the hommages to Scelsi and John Cage and for the featured music
of Xenakis, Klaus Huber and Georges Aperghis, but much of the British music
was concentrated into the final four days. One concert, given by the
Orchestre Symphonique de Mulhouse, under Luca Pfaff, afforded the interest
of hearing French performers in testing works by Tippett. His string
orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1963), receiving its
French premiere, found the players attentive and enthusiastic but far from
easy with its florid yet finicky idiom.
The rumbustiously colourful Songs for Dov (1970) fared much better, perhaps
because their urban discontents travel more easily than does the Fantasia's
English mysticism, but certainly because of tenor soloist Nigel Robson's
brilliant expertise.
Works in the second half by young Finnish and Swiss-born composers,
respectively Kaija Saariaho and Michael Jarrell, made curious contrast with
Tippett. Saariaho's 12-minute Verblendungen (1984) for 35 musicians and tape
was a typically refined and uningratiating texture-piece. Jarrell's
20-minute Der Schatten, das Band, das uns an die Erde bindet (1989)
impressed as a tautly managed pure drama of timbres, mostly brooding and
dark.
A decidedly ingratiating Saariaho piece, Monkey Fingers, Velvet Hand, was
one of the 16 short piano paraphrases of Beatles songs that Aki Takahashi
presented in her captivating late-night cabaret-like recital, 'Hyper
Beatles'; the others included Alvin Curran's pointillistic When I'm
Sixty-Four, Walter Zimmerman's When I'm Eighty-Four (the pianist had to
count aloud to 84 in Japanese), and Kevin Volans's snappily rhythmic
Happiness is a Warm Gun.
From a concert at FR3 Auditorium by the fine Ensemble Ars Nova under
Philippe Nahon one got some idea of contemporary French and German
composition. The work of neither Heiner Goebbels (born 1952) nor Pascal
Dusapin (born 1955) is much known in this country. The first writes in a
kind of enhanced jazz / rock idiom, with electronic sampling and
instrumental high jinks (we heard La Jalousie and Red Run). The second is
more determinedly serious, more abstract and dissonant - neo-modernist. His
new turbulent clarinet concerto, Aria, had its first French airing, with
Armand Angster a loudly plangent soloist, and the 13-piece ensemble busily
maintaining a thick tutti accompaniment regulated by timpani strokes.
At the Centre Culturel Le Maillon a matching pair of Maxwell Davies's mad
scenas was given. In the hands of director Pierre-Jean Valentin, Les
caprices de Miss Donnithorne - it was sung, or rather speech-sung, in
English (by the excellent Clara O'Brien) - became a fully-staged operatic
monodrama, set in an authentically mouldering mansion chamber, and whose
Miss Havisham-like protagonist in taffeta and smudged lipstick toys
naughtily with a cucumber and finally pours wine in a stream upon the
wedding tablecloth.
Huits Chants pour un Roi fou was allowed to remain the music-theatre piece
it is, with the instrumentalists (of L'Ensemble Fa) sitting in birdcages
(and bird-costumes) on the platform, the conductor (Dominique My) in front
of them, and baritone Richard Suart, as mad George III, cavorting around
them and realising the complex vocal part with extraordinary skill and
power. He was not, though, allowed at the climax to snatch the violinist's
instrument and snap it, as crucially required by the score. Are French
audiences squeamish about such things?
