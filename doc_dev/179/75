When former San Diego Symphony concertmaster Andres Cardenes left town in the 
darkest days of the orchestra's canceled 1986-87 season, he did not completely 
sever his local ties. Each year Cardenes, who is now concertmaster for the 
Pittsburgh Symphony, has returned to perform in various chamber music series. 
On March 6 and 8, he will play a pair of recitals with pianist Karen 
Follingstad, featuring the solo violin works of Brahms and Schubert, at La 
Jolla's St. James Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
After he left San Diego, Cardenes joined the University of Michigan music 
faculty with the intention of avoiding the politics and instability of 
orchestra playing. It took Pittsburgh two years to woo him away from the 
academic confines of Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban-born violinist admitted that as his first year as Pittsburgh's 
concertmaster draws to a close, his trepidation about returning to play in an 
orchestra has been proven unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"It has turned out much better than I thought it would. So far, I've been wrong 
about my reservations -- the usual orchestra mentality, problems of commitment, 
and union troubles. Here there's a good give and take with management that 
keeps things a lot calmer." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his solo performing and teaching violin students at Pittsburgh's 
Carnegie-Mellon University, Cardenes has been busy cultivating new violin 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"I've commissioned a new violin concerto by Riccardo Lorenz, which I'll 
premiere with the San Antonio Symphony on Oct. 4, 1990. Lorenz is a young 
Venezuelan composer who directs the Latin American Music Center at Indiana 
University. We were college classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, I had asked him to compose a violin and harp piece, which I played 
last August at the Skaneateles (New York) chamber music festival. I enjoyed 
working with him, so I put him to work on a concerto." 
</P>
<P>
When apprised of the San Diego Symphony's recent return to solvency and 
apparent stability, he expressed pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it's back on its feet. I'm sure Wes Brustad and others worked hard, 
and I hope this time they'll stay afloat." 
</P>
<P>
Does he regret leaving San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say this. In retrospect it was a good decision, however painful. At 
the time, there was not much of a choice. Anybody who knows me knows that I'm a 
doer. I don't like to sit around and wait." 
</P>

Replacement diva. The San Diego Opera has announced that American soprano 
Johanna Meier will replace Sabine Hass in the company's Richard Wagner concert 
March 20 at Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The German soprano has been advised by her physicians not to travel, so she 
canceled her spring American engagements, including her appearance with New 
Orleans Opera as Senta in "The Flying Dutchman," her debut role with San Diego 
Opera two seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meier, whose Wagnerian credentials include being the first American to sing 
Isolde at Germany's Bayreuth Festival in 1981, performed in a number of San 
Diego Opera productions during the 1970s. Her Marschallin in San Diego's 1976 
"Der Rosenkavalier" was a memorable performance. She has not sung for the local 
company, however, since her Met debut in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hass will not sing in the Wagner concert, her husband, bass Artur 
Korn, will perform as scheduled. His local debut in last season's "Fidelio" was 
the most universally praised aspect of that controversial production. 
</P>
<P>
American tenor Gary Lakes, whom many consider to be the newest great white hope 
of Wagnerian heldentenors, will complete the trio of singers on the concert. 
This all-Wagner program, conducted by Heinz Fricke, music director of East 
Germany's Berlin State Opera, will include a concert version of the entire 
first act of "Die Walkure." 
</P>
<P>
Musical Mecca. More than 400 string players made inquiry into the San Diego 
Symphony's auditions for two first-chair positions and five section vacancies. 
Music director designate Yoav Talmi is in town this week to sit in on these 
auditions, which started Sunday and will end Wednesday, for which the symphony 
chose 150 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi and the audition committee will hear more than 40 candidates for the 
single section viola vacancy, but only 14 cellists are trying out for the 
principal cello chair left open when former first-chair cellist Eric Kim took a 
similar position with the Cincinnati Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
According to symphony executives, they received inquiries from musicians in all 
50 states and from 14 foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Opening tonight. Rustavi, the much touted 50-member singing and dancing troupe 
from Soviet Georgia, opens a week run at Symphony Hall tonight at 8 o'clock. . 
. . At UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium, the Tokyo International Music 
Ensemble "New Tradition" will present a single concert of contemporary music 
employing traditional Japanese gagaku instruments. Among the composers 
represented on this program, which also begins at 8 p.m., are John Cage, Toru 
Takemitsu, and UCSD faculty member Joji Yuasa.
