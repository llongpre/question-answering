<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; REVIEW; SAN-JUAN-BAUTISTA  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  HAS any performance in Mission San Juan Bautista ever started on time?;    The
mission is still a working church, and its calendar of weddings and
christenings bumps up against the Cabrillo Music Festival, El Teatro Campesino
and other users. On Sunday afternoon, Cabrillo's concert was delayed about 20
minutes by an annual ceremony in which local Indians forgive the church for
crimes committed against them in the name of Christianity. (Pretty generous of
them, considering.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The concert was a beauty, despite being upset by the abrupt departure of
its Franco-Romanian concertmaster, Romuald Tecco, to France for his mother's
funeral.;    'Klinghoffer' aria substituted; Instead of the Shostakovich
violin concerto he was to have played, John Adams, guest music director for
the 1991 season, substituted "The Bird Aria" from his own opera, "The Death of
Klinghoffer." (It is scheduled for San Francisco Opera's 1992 season.);    The
aria is sung by the Palestinian Mamoud as he watches the birds from the deck
of the doomed ship Achille Lauro: "Messengers of God . . . angels free to
marry and die," he calls them (in Alice Goodman's lovely text).;    Its winged
imagery was complemented by "The Black Gondola," a barcarolle for piano (1882)
by Franz Liszt, transcribed by Adams in the dark colors of French and English
horns and massed cellos.;    Civil War horrors;  The second half grew even
darker with "The Wound-Dresser," a tableau for baritone and orchestra by
Adams, to a text by Walt Whitman. This prose-poem, based on Whitman's
experiences as a medical orderly during the Civil War, describes the horrors
of war's aftermath in unflinching terms. Whitman faced gangrene and amputated
limbs, infected wounds and unstoppable bleeding as bravely as any more
celebrated war hero, and his compassion for the dying soldiers makes the poem
bearable.;    It's not a likely subject for the concert hall, but Adams has
made it into a powerful piece of musical painting. It was written for Sanford
Sylvan, an American baritone with an exceptionally resonant and lustrous
voice. (He also sang the "Klinghoffer" excerpt.) He's so compelling that even
depressing sentiments became things of beauty in his voice. He sings again at
8 p.m. Saturday: a cycle of songs by Benjamin Britten, to poems of William
Blake.;    Adams filled out the program with Haydn (Symphony No. 83, subtitled
"La Poule" or "The Hen" because of an oboe tune that supposedly sounds like
clucking) and Mozart (Symphony No. 39). These were performed with zest and
even brilliance, despite a few orchestral slips. The Mozart got a big,
generous performance, making one appreciate Adams' gifts as a legit (as
opposed to a strictly new music) conductor.;    Amplified gospel suffers; 
With its thick adobe walls and plain box shape, the mission is kind to
classical music. The Cabrillo orchestra sounds like the Vienna Philharmonic
here, yet preserves the agility of a chamber ensemble.;    The Elements of
Praise, a contemporary gospel choir from Oakland, were not so fortunate. These
lively acoustics took their amplified arrangements, chewed them up and spit
them out as gibberish. However, the evangelical arm-twisting that connected
their songs came through loud and clear and offensive.;    The festival moves
back to Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium for its second weekend of performances.;  
  Cabrillo Music Festival; Through: Sunday; Where: Civic Auditorium, 301
Center St., Santa Cruz; Tickets: $15.50-$23.50. (408) 429-3444; Parking: Street  </TEXT>
