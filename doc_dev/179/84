<LEADPARA>  With the Persian Gulf war over, the Palestinian question can take center stage
in Tuesday's premiere of the opera "The Death of Klinghoffer.";    The first
performance of the opera, which deals with the 1985 killing of a handicapped
American Jew by Palestinian terrorists aboard the cruise ship Achille Lauro,
was in doubt until the allied offensive ended the gulf war on Feb. 28.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But the quick end of the war allowed director Peter Sellars, composer John
Adams, librettist Alice Goodman and choreographer Mark Morris to go ahead with
the premiere. That is the same team that took "Nixon in China" out of the
political sphere and made it an opera in 1987.;    Terrorism issue dealt with;
 "The Death of Klinghoffer" at the Monnaie Theater deals with the fate of the
Palestinians and the issue of terrorism. The topics could stir emotions at any
time, and the gulf war added to official concerns.;    Reading the libretto
during the gulf conflict, Interior Minister Louis Tobback said he understood
why some workers at the Monnaie "considered themselves in danger.";    During
the war, he said, "Any village idiot, and there are quite a few here, could
have called to say a bomb would go off halfway through the opening scene.";   
With the Middle East on the political agenda, many are curious about how "The
Death of Klinghoffer" deals with Israeli-Palestinian relations and terrorism.;
   Details of opera secret;  Sellars and the cast would give few details of
the opera before the premiere.;    A source close to the production said it
"will not take a stand on issues. It will show how humans react to such events
and probe their inner feelings.";    The Achille Lauro, carrying 400
passengers, was hijacked by four Palestinians in October 1985 as the Italian
ship sailed off Egypt. They demanded freedom for 50 prisoners held by Israel.;
   One of the hijackers killed the elderly, wheelchair-bound Leon Klinghoffer
of New York City. His body was thrown overboard.;    No stranger to
controversy;  Political themes have often been subjects of opera, and the
Monnaie Theater is no stranger to political controversy.;    In 1830, it
staged Jacques Aubert's "Mute of Portici," a patriotic opera remembered today
only because it roused the audience to storm out of the theater and start a
revolution that led to Belgian independence from Dutch rule.;    Tobback told
Monnaie director Gerard Mortier, "I don't want a 20th-century repeat of the
'Mute of Portici.' Once is enough.";    After Brussels, "The Death of
Klinghoffer" is to move to Lyon, France, in April before making its U.S.
premiere in September at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  </TEXT>
