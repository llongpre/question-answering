<LEADPARA>  ONE of the hottest American composers today, New Yorker John Corigliano is the
current focus at the San Francisco Symphony. His music was part of a
comprehensive foray into memorials at Davies Hall in the program unveiled
Thursday afternoon.;   For the late symphony bassoonist Wayne Parrish
(1949-91), there was Balbastre's "Noel: Votre bonte grand Dieu" ("Your
Generosity, Great God"), a pipe-organ solo.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For Mozart and his bicentennial, as well as for the late James J. Parker, a
symphony patron, there was the Mozart C Minor Adagio and Fugue.;   And for
people with AIDS, Corigliano created Symphony No. 1 (1990).;   For no
commemoration at all, Brahms created his Double Concerto, which helped turn
this into one of the year's longest concerts (two hours, 15 minutes) at the
Thursday matinee opener.;   The West Coast premiere of Corigliano's 40-minute
symphony unveiled a profound work of mystery, mourning, anger and anguish,
high in tragedy. Corigliano, 53, is among the first symphonic composers to
create a major AIDS memorial piece. Not only is the work eloquent and timely,
but also the composer is a focal figure this month on both coasts.;   Next
week, his opera "The Ghosts of Versailles" will be the first world premiere at
the Metropolitan Opera in a generation.;   Corigliano is a tragedian,
belonging to the new romantic school with traceable (though distant) roots in
Bartok and Sibelius. He has a fine ear for subtlety as he runs the gamut from
rage to the wispiest sounds of sweetness, sometimes with just a distant
offstage piano overheard playing a favorite tango.;   He names friends who
died of AIDS in his score, and ties each to a favored theme or phrase. The
full thrust of the huge brass and percussion sections abate for ear-caressing
sounds wafting in and out like music in the wind. The four movements are a
furious Apologue, a symbolic Tarantella (a toe-tapper gone awry), a somber
Chaconne (with a lengthy cello duo) and Epilogue.;   It is the most eloquent
new symphony I've heard in years: bitter, nostalgic, disillusioned, audacious,
affectionate.;   Conductor Herbert Blomstedt led it impressively, far more so
than his limp Mozart Adagio and Fugue. Organist John Balka performed the
upbeat Christmas music by Claude Balbastre (1727-99). This was a late program
addition to recall Wayne Parrish, who died of AIDS-related causes.;   The
concert will have a delayed broadcast on KKHI-AM and FM radio Jan. 7 at 8 p.m.
