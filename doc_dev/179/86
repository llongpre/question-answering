Though the program book was not emblazoned with the now-familiar red logo of 
the San Diego Soviet arts festival, Saturday evening's Auryn Quartet concert at 
UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium did feature a minor treasure of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The youthful, visiting ensemble from Cologne, West Germany, opened the 15th 
season of UCSD's chamber music series with a compelling performance of Alfred 
Schnittke's Third String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1934, Schnittke is considered one of the leading Russian composers from 
the generation after Shostakovich. At last year's Soviet arts festival in 
Boston, Schnittke's Requiem Mass for chorus and orchestra was one of the major 
musical performances of that cultural exchange. This UCSD event was not part of 
the current Soviet Arts festival, but the performance of Schnittke's work 
expands the festival's portrait of contemporary Soviet music. 
</P>
<P>
Schnittke's three-movement quartet, written in 1983, revealed that the composer 
is keenly aware of trends in Western European composition. Although his idiom 
is demanding, it is not daunting. Like Western composers who have taken their 
cues from Edgar Varese, Schnittke values sound for its own sake and tends to 
use sonic clusters as motivic building blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Though this approach made the Third Quartet's droning, modal first movement 
seem unusually static, the rest of the work was replete with contrasting ideas 
organized by a recurring dissonant chorale theme. The composer even included an 
agitated, highly motoric section that sounded like an homage to Shostakovich. 
If Schnittke's structure was elusive on a first hearing, surely his dense 
concentration of feeling was unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
The Auryn Quartet (violinists Matthias Lingenfelder and Jens Oppermann, violist 
Steuart Eaton and cellist Andreas Arndt) followed the usual practice and 
surrounded this unknown contemporary work with two familiar offerings, 
Beethoven's A Major Quartet, Op. 18, No. 5, and his F Major Quartet, Op. 135. 
Neither performance shed new light on these works, although the A Major Quartet 
was notable for unusually clean delineation and a sunny balance among the 
players. Beethoven's Op. 135, however, received a perfunctory and sometimes 
ill-tuned reading. 
</P>

All that jazz. Although the surprises in the world of music resulting from 
glasnost cannot compete with the startling political events unfolding in 
Eastern Europe, they are worth noting. Tonight at Elario's in La Jolla, two San 
Diego Symphony guest soloists in town for the Soviet arts festival will hold a 
unique jam session. Russian pianist Nicolai Petrov and U.S. clarinetist Richard 
Stoltzman will play a program of American jazz for 150 friends and supporters 
of the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
These two soloists can be heard in their usual context Nov. 2-3 at Symphony 
Hall, when Petrov will play the West Coast premiere of Rodion Shchedrin's 
Second Piano Concerto and Stoltzman will perform American composer John 
Corigliano's 1977 Clarinet Concerto.

Batting 0 for 2. The San Diego Symphony has not been having any luck thus far 
importing guest conductors for the Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Soviet conductor Evgeny Kolobov failed to show for the orchestra's 
"Alexander Nevsky" production. Now this week, Soviet conductor Pavel Kogan 
canceled his Nov. 2-4 symphony concerts on account of illness. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Jansoug Kakhidze, San Diego Opera's guest conductor for its "Boris 
Godunov" production, was able to fill in for Kogan on short notice. One of the 
featured works on Kogan's program is Rodion Shchedrin's Second Piano Concerto, 
a work performed only a few times in this country. In an interview before 
"Boris Godunov" opened, Kakhidze noted that he was well acquainted with 
Shchedrin's concerto, and in fact had conducted it last year in Boston as part 
of that American city's Soviet arts festival. Kakhidze, creative director and 
principal conductor of Georgia's Tbilisi State Opera Theatre, received high 
accolades for his conducting of the San Diego Opera orchestra in "Boris 
Godunov." Local culture vultures eagerly await Kakhidze's symphony debut here.

Music and the future. In the 19th Century, Richard Wagner immodestly claimed 
that he was composing the music of the future. Since Wagner's time, most 
composers have been content to write for their own era. UC San Diego's Center 
for Music Experiment, however, regularly works on the frontiers of tomorrow's 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the center's current research will produce the next generation of 
musical computers, according to F. Richard Moore, the center's director. 
</P>
<P>
"These will be the first computers to have their musical capacity built in 
rather than added on," explained Moore, who will lecture on these new 
electronic tools and on the related topic of psychoacoustics (the perception of 
sound) at the La Jolla Athanaeum Nov. 6 . 
</P>
<P>
"Technology in Music and Art," the La Jolla library's current lecture series, 
began last night with a lecture by UCSD's Pulitzer Prize-winning resident 
composer Roger Reynolds. One of the founders of the center, Reynolds has 
composed many of his works using the center's computer facilities. On Nov. 13, 
UCSD art professor Harold Cohen will talk about his computer-collaborated 
artwork, and all three men will participate in a panel discussion on Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
According to Moore, in the last decade -- he came to the center in 1979 -- the 
most significant thing researchers have learned is how little they really know 
about musical processes. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time, it was common wisdom that, by analyzing the works of great 
composers, we could get a computer to write, say, Beethoven's 10th Symphony. 
This was one of many early misconceptions," Moore said. He further noted that 
breaking down seemingly simple musical expressions into the requisite series of 
step-by-step instructions needed for programming computers has usually turned 
out to be much more complex than originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
Though he was a composer before he became the center's director, composing has 
taken a back seat to his research and administrative chores. Moore now 
describes himself as a musical engineer, a term Wagner probably never 
contemplated when he was looking into the music of his future.
