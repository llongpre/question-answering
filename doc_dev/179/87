   Composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein has taken on
William F. Buckley Jr. on the conservative columnist's turf.
   In the latest exchange between the two, Bernstein wrote an open
letter to the columnist that ran Wednesday in the Daily News of New
York, which syndicates Buckley. ``Your column,'' Bernstein told
Buckley, ``... is beneath your dignity.''
   The spat began when Bernstein, in an Oct. 30 opinion essay in The
New York Times, decried efforts to besmirch the word ``liberalism.''
   ``Liberal is a word soiled by the greedy, reactionary,
back-looking impulse toward tyranny,'' Bernstein said.
   Buckley retaliated in a Nov. 2 colalistic two-term president in times
of peace and prosperity.
   But a selective profile could just as easily fit the image of
Michael J. Dukakis. Van Buren was a short, liberal Democrat, a
former Northeast governor with strong ethnic roots. And unlike Bush,
he was not born to the privilege so ridiculed by his critics.
   A dozen incumbent vice presidents have succeeded their bosses,
but only four by election. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the
nation's second and third presidents, were the first two.
   Some called the long drought which kept the second fiddles from
moving to the first string the ``Van Buren jinx.'' But most
historians say that difficulty winning a presidential election
simply goes with the vice presidential turf.
   ``When you're vice president, you don't stand on your own,'' said
Bruce Stewart, superintendent of the Martin Van Buren National
Historic Site in Van Buren's native Kinderhook, 130 miles north of
New York City. ``You're always associated with someone else. You're
linked more with the outgoing president than as your own man.''
   And voters' typical desire for change has kept most incumbent
deputies out of the White House, noted Stewart, who oversees
Linderwald, the mansion to which Van Buren in 1840.
   Van Buren, a Dutchman, helped found the Democratic Party, and his
behind-the-scenes dealing built the foundation for today's
convention and electioneering process, Stewart said.
   But Van Buren's Democratic ``liberalism'' of the 1830s would fit
today at
   desk of Ronald Reagan, said George Berndt, a historian at
Lindenwald, which is run by the National Park Service. ``To a large
extent, Van Buren believed in the policies of the present Republican
Party,'' he said.
   For example, Van Buren's was a strong advocate of states' rights,
feeling that the federal government should not intrude on social
issues.
   For Van Buren, the charge that he had little regard for common
people dug deep, said Donald Cole, a historian in Exeter, N.H., who
specializes in the Jackson era.
   ``Van Buren was considered kind of feminine, aristocratic,'' said
Cole, whose book, ``Martin Van Buren and the American Political
System,'' was published by Princeton University Press. ``His
opponents liked to say he drank wine out of fancy cups.''
   That even became part of the opposing Whig battle cry in 1840,
when Van Buren lost his re-election bid to William Henry Harrison,
said Michael Henderson, assistant curator at Lindenwald.
   Harrison forces used the slogan, ``Would you rather have a goblet
of champagne or a glass of cider?'' to imply that Harrison, born in
a log cabin, was closer to the electorate than the genteel Van Buren.
   Van Buren was born a tavern keeper's son among the Dutch settlers
in Kinderhook. He built his wealth from a law practice fashioned
after long apprenticeships.
   Van Buren was Jackson's campaign manager in 1828 and the top
adviser in the president's ``Kitchen Cabinet'' through his two
terms, Berndt said. He was Jackson's hand-picked successor.
   While Bush exults in matching Van Buren's accomplishment, there's
another ``jinx'' associated with the little Dutchman he has yet to
overcome. Van Buren got beat, by William Henry Harrison, when he ran
for re-election.
