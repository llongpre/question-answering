<LEADPARA>  Jack Ditz was a businessman who sold tractors, a mentor who advised Stanford
athletes and a father who reveled in the success of his daughters, but when
people asked him what he did for a living, he'd say, "I just build houses.";  
Before he died Saturday of cancer at the age of 70, John Adams Ditz could say
that he had built 20,000 of them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Ditz was a principal in a venture that started in 1954 with 101 homes in
the Cherry Woods subdivision in San Jose's Willow Glen and ended as one of the
largest home construction firms on the West Coast three decades later.;  
Ditz, his brother, George, and Bob Crane founded South Bay Construction Co.,
which became Ditz-Crane, which finally merged with Foremost-McKesson Corp. of
San Francisco. Along the way they built homes all over the West and some other
Santa Clara Valley edifices as well: St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Saratoga,
the Palo Alto University Club, the Stacey Building in Stanford's Industrial
Park.;   "My dad really understood how to build a building," said his
daughter, Susan, a former newspaper reporter and now writer who lives in San
Carlos. "He'd work side by side with the crews, and every time he got his
hands on the architect's drawing, he'd do some fixing.";   The side-by-side
relationships of Jack Ditz had begun in the 1930s when George A. Ditz Jr. was
a Stanford upperclassman and Jack and Bob Crane were freshmen. George went on
to Harvard, Crane played football and Jack was captain of the ski team.;  
During World War II, they all joined the Navy, George and Bob on aircraft
carriers and Jack on a destroyer escort.;   Afterward, while Bob studied law,
George and Jack sold Caterpillars and John Deere tractors in Santa Clara and
San Benito counties. "My dad was a simple guy," said his daughter. "That's one
of the things people appreciate about him. One of his favorite things to do
was drive the tractors.";   But new horizons called the Ditz brothers and
Crane and they shed their tractor business and concentrated on homes.;   When
they merged with Foremost-McKesson in 1970, George Ditz became president and
Jack Ditz served as a vice president until 1985. Crane died earlier this
year.;   Jack Ditz never really left The Farm. His father, George A. Ditz Sr.,
a Stockton attorney, had been Stanford student body president in 1911 and he
served as a trustee from 1942 to '62.;   When Jack Ditz was asked to be a
Stanford trustee in 1982, it was "one of the things my father was proudest
of," said Susan Ditz.;   He served until 1987, but his service to his school
had stretched back years before when he found a couple of young football
players at James Lick High School in San Jose.;   One of them was Phillip
Passafuime, a former assistant district attorney in Santa Cruz County and now
a Scotts Valley attorney.;   Ditz paved the way to Stanford. "I sat on the
bench for a couple of years," Passafuime said, "my friend played a hell of a
lot more than I did." The friend, Jim Plunkett, won the Heisman Trophy as a
Stanford quarterback -- and later two Super Bowls for the Los Angeles
Raiders.; John Adams Ditz; (box)Born: March 4, 1921, Stockton, Calif.;
