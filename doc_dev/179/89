Now that the former Almeida Music Festival has shrunk to a mere pendant for
the Almeida Opera season, we still hope - quite unrealistically - that it
will somehow distill the newest and liveliest music into its few allotted
slots. It can't, and doesn't. The non-operatic part of this year's programme
comprises just two concerts by the Brindisi Quartet, two potpourri piano
recitals, a recitation of Strauss's 'melodrama' Enoch Arden and a single
concert by Richard Bernas's Music Projects ensemble. Thus the latter, given
on Saturday, was so to speak the only broad-gauge exhibit - and it proved
discouragingly narrow.
It was well played, of course; the Bernas team's contributions always are.
What it signally failed to do was to suggest that anything of fresh interest
was going on. It concluded grimly with John Adams' 1982 Grand Pianola Music,
which now sounds like such a loud, protracted nullity as to undermine the
cleverer impression made by his more recent theatre-pieces. It is possible -
just - to imagine why it got a warm American welcome in its time, when pure
minimalism was beginning to seem a straitjacket.
What the 'grand pianola' plays, however, is minimalist textures (endlessly
repeated notes and figures, etc) without the fascination of slow, systematic
change that was the original point. Instead there are sudden, arbitrary
switches for variety's sake, with colourful patches which hark directly back
to Stravinsky, and for emphasis some blatant Hollywood effects (scored with
unblinking crudity). The total is far less than the sum of its parts. If
Yvar Mikhashoff's arrangements of some Conlon Nancarrow player-piano studies
seemed pleasant but unnecessary, Nancarrow's urgent, crabby sense of musical
purpose made Adams sound flabbily catch-as-catch-can.
Presumably the music of David Lang - represented here by Are You
Experienced? (after Jimi Hendrix, with Lang delivering his own winsomely
fragmentary narration) and his recent Orpheus Over and Under, with a
'music-drama' soon to come - answers to some current felt need in New York.
One can only guess at what that might be; in London both pieces sounded
desperately thin and wispy, without even Adams' showmanship to brighten
their inconsequent progress. In this company Vic Hoyland's new Chamber
Concerto (an Almeida Opera commission) at least evinced the marks of
thoughtful construction, hard-edged and unappetising though it was.
