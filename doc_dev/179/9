In the 1970s George Crumb was the most performed of contemporary American
composers, a success founded on his knack of offering all the exotic
textural trappings of the avant garde within a friendly sugar-coated shell.
Twenty years on it is John Adams who occupies a similar position of eminence
in the US. Adams's confections may be sugar-free yet they have their own
surface allure, even if in keeping with the spirit of the 1990s it is a far
more astringent one.
On Monday Adams himself conducted the London Sinfonietta in a programme of
contemporary American works, three of them UK premieres, which ended with
Crumb's Ancient Voices of Children. The song cycle was beautifully delivered
by the mezzosoprano Christine Whittlesey and treble Sam Pay, yet sounds now
a museum piece, the thin musical substance sustained only by its web of
cultural references and the undimmed beauty of the Lorca text.
There just might be more magic left in the sounds than was obvious here, for
Adams conducts rather as he composes, with bold poster colours and bracing
rhythmic energy which leave precious little room for subtlety or magic.
Certainly Peter Lieberson's nimble Raising the Gaze would have benefitted
from more air and awareness of light and shade than Adams and the
Sinfonietta instrumentalists suggested, while Tod Machover's Song of Penance
seemed over-insistently eloquent.
Machover's was, though, an intriguing construction, with a solo
computer-linked 'hyperviola' (played by Paul Silverstone) set against dense
textures which combined live and pre-recorded instruments and voices. A
specially commissioned poem serves as thematic backbone; it appears in both
spoken and sung form throughout the work, usually embedded deep in the
textures, while the hyperviola alternates keening chromaticism with ripe
romantic harmonies. The mixture is beguiling and repellent by turns like
latter day Skryabin; the sheer density of the sound world is seductive in
itself.
There was some new Adams too, a Chamber Symphony completed last year which
was receiving its first British performance. The Schoenbergian echoes of the
title belie the musical substance. There are three movements with
calculatedly memorable titles  - 'Mongrel Airs', 'Aria with Walking Bass',
'Roadrunner'  - and plenty of spiky stylistic allusions along the way.
The first movement jumbles Soldier's Tale Stravinsky with Threepenny Opera
Weill, the second unfolds an increasing elaborate skein of lyrical lines
over a constantly mobile bass, while the finale is an extrovert romp, highly
virtuosic (brilliantly played by the Sinfonietta) and propelled by a
rock-like rhythmic pulse. It is artfully put together, undeniably attractive
and ultimately, I suspect, totally specious.
