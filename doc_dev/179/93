SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KEN HERMAN: SINGER STRUGGLES TO 
PLUCK SPIRITUALS FROM DEEP ABYSS

In both performance and recording, the current preoccupation appears to be 
restoring music to its original state. Period instrument orchestras, from 
London's Hanover Band to the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra, thrive, and a new 
generation of singers has been trained to execute Baroque ornamentation 
fluently and to improvise cadenzas on the spot. 
</P>

Mezzo-soprano Blanche Foreman is an advocate of another rich vein of authentic 
performance practice, one much closer to home for many American musicians than 
the opera-ballets of Lully or the early symphonies of Haydn. Foreman sings the 
solo vocal arrangements of Negro spirituals and art songs written by black 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Foreman, the Negro spiritual has suffered as much from prejudice 
by the American music establishment as from neglect or confusion by the current 
generation of black musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"In the most prestigious vocal competitions, you cannot sing a Negro spiritual 
arranged by a black composer," explained Foreman, "although in the category of 
American music, they would let you sing Aaron Copland's setting of 'Shall We 
Gather at the River?' And the younger generation thinks that spirituals are 
some form of Gospel music, which is now the vogue. The spiritual has really 
been abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
A member of Vassar College's music faculty, Foreman did much of her research on 
the Negro spiritual while pursuing her doctorate at Indiana University. This 
week in San Diego, Foreman will present two recitals in which she will combine 
spirituals, art songs by black American composers, and song cycles by Gustav 
Mahler. Friday night she will sing at Hillcrest's Words and Music Gallery, and 
Sunday at 4 p.m. she will appear at La Jolla's St. James Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
According to Foreman, the first Negro spirituals arranged for piano and voice 
were done early in the century by Henry T. Burleigh, who studied harmony with 
Dvorak. Paul Robeson's accompanist, Lawrence Brown, was also a prolific 
arranger of spirituals, as was Hall Johnson, whose popular choir sang the sound 
track for the 1936 movie "Green Pastures." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman not only performs this repertory, but teaches spirituals to her college 
vocal students along with opera and traditional European art songs. 
</P>
<P>
"With the right training, anyone can sing spirituals," she said. "You don't 
have to be black. After all, I'm by no means German, and I sing Mahler." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman's other crusade is performing art songs written by black American 
composers. From this repertory, she champions songs composed by the late 
Margaret Bonds, who set the poetry of Langston Hughes to music, as well as 
compositions by Charles Lloyd and Leslie Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"There are at least 600 of these songs out there, but getting them published is 
one of the greatest problems," Foreman said. 
</P>

Talmi tales. Last week, San Diego Symphony music director designate Yoav Talmi 
smiled for the cameras and cut a red ribbon to open the new box office in 
Symphony Towers. For the rest of his week in San Diego, however, he kept a low 
profile. He met extensively with executive director Wesley Brustad to map out 
the 1990-91 season, Talmi's first season as music director, and he listened to 
some trumpet auditions. In anticipation of the orchestra's new Pulitzer Series 
at UC San Diego, he visited the UCSD campus. 
</P>
<P>
This week he is back on the podium conducting two programs for the final week 
of the Houston Symphony's Mostly Mozart festival. Tomorrow night at Houston's 
Jones Hall, Talmi will be joined by cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, a familiar soloist 
to San Diego Symphony audiences, in the Haydn C Major Cello Concerto. Friday, 
Talmi will lead the Houston crew and soloist Ken Noda in Mozart's Piano 
Concerto No. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Local audiences will have to wait until Oct. 13 for their turn to hear Talmi 
and Mozart, however, when the Israeli conductor's season-opening concert will 
pair Mahler's Fifth Symphony with Mozart's A Major Piano Concerto, K. 488, with 
pianist Garrick Ohlsson.

Alfresco nuptials. Hospitality Point, the San Diego Symphony's summer digs, 
provided the backdrop for orchestra horn player Doug Hall's wedding 
re-enactment Thursday evening. Forty relatives and symphony colleagues gathered 
behind the stage to witness Hall's restaged nuptials to Laura Zoeckler. 
Minister Nels Oas presided at Thursday's reprised ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The two were married by a justice of the peace in June, but chose this time, 
before a SummerPops concert, to allow members of Hall's musical family to 
attend. In keeping with Hall's profession, the wedding music was supplied by a 
brass ensemble. Hal Wingard, husband of symphony violinist Eileen Wingard, 
offered an original song, which he accompanied on guitar. After the ceremony, 
Hall went to work deep in the bowels of the horn section while Laura and her 
attendants joined the SummerPops audience.
