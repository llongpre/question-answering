<LEADPARA>  THE San Jose Chamber Music Society remains as imaginative and unpredictable as
ever.;    For St. Patrick's Day, it offered a German baroque program. And for
Easter Sunday, it presented a secular French concert featuring music of the
past century.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The performers this week were the Ensemble Accord from Indianapolis,
performing at the congenial First Unitarian Church.;    The signal
contribution of this concert, featuring composers from the Paris
Conservatoire, was the spotlight it placed on longtime Bay Area composer
Darius Milhaud (1892-1974).;    As the concert showed, the Milhaud centenary
next year should be an occasion for a fresh look at his music. But a
full-scale 1992 Milhaud tribute will take work: The institution where he
taught, Mills College, has well-publicized financial difficulties; the San
Francisco Symphony is squeamish about French music; Stanford University seems
to have totally forgotten Milhaud's rakishly convivial "Music for Stanford" of
1969; and the San Francisco Opera has already programmed a modern opus by John
Adams, making Milhaud's big piece, "Christopher Columbus," an unlikely
candidate for the fall 1992 season.;    Milhaud proved a resourceful,
versatile, witty and charismatic composer the times I met him at Mills. He not
only lightened up post-Wagnerian concert music but also pioneered the use of
jazz, spatial effects, chance music and polytonality (playing in more than one
key at a time) in his work.;    The thoroughly jaunty side of Milhaud emerged
during the Sunday night concert in his "Quatre Visages" for viola and piano,
performed by Ensemble Accord. The piece presents four sketches of women, two
of them particularly noteworthy: "La Californienne" is wistful, tranquil,
harmonious, while "La Parisienne" is hyperactive, garrulous and stormy -- or
so the music suggested.;    Ensemble Accord is headed by the ex-Bay Area
husband-wife team of violinist Dean Franke and violist Susan Chan. They are
joined by a pair of high-quality players, cellist Jennifer Culp and pianist
Marc Shapiro. Quite apart from his sinewy Faure, Shapiro provided the familiar
Poulenc "Three Perpetual Movements," making its perfumy, fashionable contours
seem elegant and seamless.;    The rest of the program -- most of it dating
from 1914-32 -- was indifferent. Faure's Piano Quartet No. 1 in C Minor showed
how much the composer could sound like Brahms when he really tried. Erik
Satie's "Things Seen Right and Left (Without Glasses)" for violin and piano
are miniatures, precious and eccentric. And Arthur Honegger's "Sonatine" for
violin and cello proved a bland exercise in poor intonation.;    The society's
next concert is April 21, with the San Jose String Quartet, featuring San Jose
Symphony players in Mozart, Brahms and Ginastera.  </TEXT>
