   Leonard Bernstein, the ``West Side Story''
composer and flamboyant conductor who won a wider audience for
classical music and became a pop celebrity of the rock 'n' roll
age, has died at age 72.
   Bernstein died Sunday at his home of lung failure, said his
physician, Dr. Kevin M. Cahill.
   The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Bernstein became the
wunderkind of American music nearly five decades ago at a time when
all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained
in Europe.
   Bernstein was a conductor, pianist, educator, author and
composer. His compositions included the theatrical, chamber music,
symphonies, ballet and even a Mass.
   ``He was the most versatile musician and he did more than any
other person in this century for the appreciation of American music
and music culture,'' said Sir Georg Solti, music director of the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
   A man of strong passions and sometimes sloppy sentimentality, he
led an orchestra performance at a liberated concentration camp,
raised money for the Black Panthers and on Christmas 1989
celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall by conducting Beethoven's
``Ninth Symphony'' in Berlin.
   His televised ``Young People's Concerts'' helped introduce the
baby-boom generation to classical music and won 11 Emmy Awards. He
also won Grammys and a Tony.
   ``Leonard Bernstein will be remembered as the man who began to
teach Americans what classical music was,'' said violinist Isaac
Stern.
   His trademark was his exuberance at the podium. His jabs,
contortions and leaps occasionally caused him to fall. At his first
rehearsal for a guest appearance with the St. Louis Symphony, his
initial downbeat, or cue to the musicians, so startled them that
they just looked on in silence.
   ``He shagged, shimmied and, believe it or not, bumped,''
composer-critic Virgil Thomson once said. ``Bernstein rose
vertically, a la Nijinsky, and hovered there a good 15 seconds,''
New York Times critic Harold Schonberg wrote.
   Bernstein maintained that conductors should be actors.
   ``I don't mean that when the music is tragic you've got to act
like Barrymore in `Hamlet,''' he said. ``But you have to indicate
to the orchestra by your body and your face, which is all you've
got, what the shape of the phrase is.''
   Born in Lawrence, Mass., Bernstein - he pronounced his name the
Germanic way, BERN-stine - got a relatively late start in music. He
was 10 before his Aunt Clara gave the family an upright piano.
   Shunning his father's beauty supply business, Bernstein studied
at Harvard, the Curtis Institute and the Boston Symphony's summer
retreat at Tanglewood, Mass. Among his mentors were composers Aaron
Copland and Serge Koussevitzky.
   Bernstein in 1943 was a wiry young man of 25 with dark wavy hair
when he got his big break: filling in at the last minute for an
ailing Bruno Walter to conduct the New York Philharmonic in a
concert broadcast on national radio.
   The triumph joined World War II headlines on The New York Times'
front page.
   ``I walked on with an awful hangover and don't remember another
thing until I heard a thunderous ovation,'' Bernstein recalled.
   In 1943, he wrote the ballet ``Fancy Free,'' about three
sailors' 24-hour shore leave in New York. It became the Broadway
smash ``On The Town.''
   Soon to come were his chamber opera ``Trouble In Tahiti''; the
movie score for ``On the Waterfront,'' and Broadway's ``Wonderful
Town,'' for which Bernstein won his only Tony. Later came
Broadway's ``Candide,'' and ``West Side Story,'' the
Romeo-and-Juliet tale set amid the fire escapes and gang warfare of
New York City. It was completed in 1957 and was made into a movie
in 1961.
   In 1958 he became the New York Philharmonic's first
American-born director. In 1969, he gave up his post to devote more
time to composition.
   ``He first of all educated a whole generation in America with
his televised educational concerts, and as the music director of
the New York Philharmonic, hundreds of recordings have become a
household item in every music lover's home,'' said Zubin Mehta,
music director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in Tel Aviv.
   ``Lenny had the magic touch. Almost anybody he conducted, he
popularized,'' said Morton Gould, president of the American Society
of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``Whatever he did, he had
such involvement and such dedication. When Lenny did Mahler, he was
Mahler.''
   Joan Peyser, author of ``Bernstein: A Biography,'' said the
maestro ``put American music on the map.''
   Bernstein's celebrity blossomed in the 1940s. Women were said to
swoon when he stepped to the podium. Fans reportedly tore at his
clothes and attacked him in his car. Actress Tallulah Bankhead,
after watching him in rehearsal, offered this come-on: ``Darling, I
have gone mad over your back muscles. You must come and have dinner
with me.''
   A liberal Democrat and friend of the Kennedy family, he wrote a
work for the Kennedy inauguration and dedicated his ``Mass'' in
1971 to John F. Kennedy. His star-studded fund-raiser for the Black
Panthers in 1970 was mocked by writer Tom Wolfe as ``radical
chic.''
   Four days before his death, Bernstein, a heavy smoker, retired
from the concert stage, citing emphysema and other lung ailments.
His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood on Aug. 19.
   Survivors include son Alexander, a teacher, and two daughters,
Jaime Thomas, a rock musician, and Nina Bernstein, an actress. His
wife, actress Felicia Montealegre, died in 1978.
   Funeral services will be private.
