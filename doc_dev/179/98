   If George Bush wants advice from former
presidents, he is likely to have more of them to call upon than any
president since Abraham Lincoln.
   For the first time since Martin Van Buren died on July 24, 1862,
there are expected to be four living ex-presidents after
Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.
   This, of course, assumes that President Reagan and the three
former presidents now living - Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy
Carter - survive to see Bush sworn in.
   All of them are believed to be in good health. Reagan is the
oldest, at 77. Nixon and Ford are 75 and Carter, 64.
   There have only been four times in American history when as many
as four former presidents were living - during the administrations
of John Quincy Adams, James Knox Polk, James Buchanan and Lincoln.
   Actually, when Lincoln moved into the White House in March of
1861, there were five of his predecessors still around. In addition
to Buchanan, whom he succeeded, they were Van Buren, John Tyler,
Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce.
   Tyler died in January 1862, and Van Buren died six months later.
   Five times in history there have been no former presidents alive,
most recently for the last year and a half of the Nixon
administration, after Lyndon B. Johnson died in January 1973.
   George Washington of course could not call on one of his
predecessors for advice, because he didn't have any. As for his
successor, John Adams, Washington died in December 1979, midway
through the Adams administration.
   Adams and his three successors, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison
and James Monroe, all survived into the administration of Adams'
son, John Quincy Adams.
   The elder Adams was the longest lived of American presidents,
dying at 91.
   The younger Adams, Andrew Jackson, Van Buren and Tyler all lived
into the Polk administration of the 1840s.
   Polk died at 53, shortly after leaving office, but Van Buren,
Tyler, Fillmore and Pierce all lived into and through Buchanan's
term as president.
   Fillmore and Pierce, along with Andrew Johnson, were living when
Ulysses S. Grant took office in 1869, but all had died by the time
Grant left the White House in 1877.
   The next time the nation was left without a living ex-president
was during the last two months of the Herbert Hoover administration,
following the death of Calvin Coolidge in January 1933.
   Hoover was the only living president throughout the White House
tenure of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.
   Both Truman and President Dwight Eisenhower named Hoover to head
commissions to reorganize the executive branch of government.
   Reagan has met privately with Nixon several times during his
administration.
