   The Olympic Games don't open until next month, but
illustrator Bart Forbes has already won some artistic gold medals.
   The U.S. Postal Service chose designs submitted by Forbes for
both the 1988 Winter and Summer Olympic commemoratives. The summer
stamp, which depicts a male gymnast, was issued Friday at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo.
   In addition, Forbes, whose realistic depictions have graced the
covers of Time, Sports Illustrated and dozens of other magazines,
has been chosen by the Korean Olympic Committee as the official
artist of the summer games.
   Forbes, 49, was commissioned to finish 12 paintings before he
leaves for Seoul next month. He will paint about 20 more for a
museum that will commemorate the games.
   A golfer and sometime-tennis player, Forbes says he's not an
athlete, but his studio in a renovated century-old two-story
building in Dallas' arts district is trimmed with old baseballs,
hats and other sports paraphernalia.
   ``Sports is a subject matter I like to do,'' Forbes said,
calling the Olympics assignment a career highlight. ``It's fun.
It's exciting and timely.''
   Timely but not dated. Forbes believes well done art is timeless.
   ``I don't want to get caught doing finish-line illustrations,''
Forbes said of the typical sporting event depiction.
   ``The crux for any painter or illustrator is not being satisfied
with the first or most obvious solution,'' he said. The challenge,
he continued, is to portray the human spirit of the games, how
athletes respond to enormous pressure, for instance.
   ``Many of the athletes train four years for just one shot. It's
an incredible event. Sure, there are some who are just glad they
made it to the Olympics, but for so many they're there for only one
thing: a gold medal.''
   An art graduate of the University of North Carolina, Forbes
earned an advanced degree at the Art Center in Los Angeles. Unsure
of his ability to break into the New York design industry, Forbes
settled in Dallas for several years after school.
   Later, after spending five years in New York, Forbes returned
with his family to Dallas. He said he's lucky to be able to live
where he wants and work on a ``national scale.''
   Forbes paints with a simple realism he says is influenced by the
American artists Thomas Eakins and Winslow Homer, among others.
   The KOC commission was something of a coincidence.
   When the United States Sports Academy in Mobile, Ala., honored
Forbes as its sports artist of the year in 1987, he shared the
graduate school's spotlight with Korean Olympic Committee president
Chong Ha Kim.
   A few weeks after that meeting, Kim told Forbes he'd been chosen
the committee's official artist and invited him to Seoul for a week
to make preparations.
   Forbes' first 12 paintings, based on that visit, will be part of
a calendar the KOC will sell during the Olympics, which begin
September 17.
   In all, Forbes will create an original work depicting each
Olympic event as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.
