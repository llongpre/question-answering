   PITTSBURGH -- Plenty of companies claim to have found
strategies to bullet-proof themselves against recession,
among them PPG Industries, whose stock has soared 46% from
its October low.
   Not only did the maker of glass, chemicals and coatings
post record results for 1990 but Chairman Vincent A. Sarni
found occasion to take a bow in the just-issued annual
report, declaring that the company's "strategy was tested and
it proved to be sound."

   Well, not quite that sound.
   PPG startled Wall Street with last week's disclosure that
it expects first-quarter profit to drop as much as 50%,
reflecting weak demand from its core automobile and
construction markets. So much for the company's recession
resistance.
   Although Mr. Sarni warned shareholders in the annual
report that 1991 might be a tough year, the stock tumbled
more than 2 points after the midweek announcement, before
recovering Friday to 50 1/4, up 1.
   Now, PPG is suddenly back to looking like a plain old
manufacturer that isn't invulnerable to the business cycle.
And on that basis, analysts say, the stock looks like a weak
performer going forward. It all goes to show that even if
"cyclical" stocks do outperform the market, as some people
expect, it's unwise for investors to blindly snap up the
shares of any company in a basic industry.
   Some analysts say the bad news for PPG may not be over
even if the ecomony recovers. Although increased car sales
and housing starts would certainly help, those industries
have been heading down for five years. Worse, there's an
overcapacity in glass and in some of PPG's chemicals.
   As a result, some analysts believe the company may not
benefit, as it usually has, as an "early-cycle stock," or a
stock that prospers when the economy is coming out of a
cyclical downturn. Some PPG analysts also say the company
needs new products to drive earnings; it made an effort with
a foray into medical electronics systems, but that has been a
bust.
   "At the end of the day," says James Wilbur, an analyst at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., "the biggest challenge is
how can the company continue to grow when its core products
-- glass and paint -- are in slow-growth markets?"
   It's not that PPG hasn't been trying. In recent years, the
company has made considerble headway in diminishing its
dependence on longtime core businesses.
   The company has pushed aggressively overseas, with Europe
now accounting for 43% of earnings, up from zero in 1984. PPG
has expanded its replacement-glass and coatings business to
ease its dependence on new-car sales. It wrung out costs,
beefed up the specialty chemicals line, introduced
high-technology coatings and bought Olympic and Lucite
paints.
   The strategy seemed to be working as the company generated
1990 earnings of $475 million, or $4.43 a share, on sales of
more than $6 billion. Investors applauded, and in the 12
months through Feb. 28 the stock price jumped 33%, far
outstripping a 10% gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index.
   But PPG is still at the mercy of its longtime markets, as
the first quarter of this year illustrates. General Motors
remains its largest customer.
   "The notion that the company was less cyclical now hasn't
held true," says Charles LoCastro, an analyst at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, who acknowledges that he was taken aback
by the profit announcement. "I thought their earnings would
hold up much better."
   Mr. LoCastro has downgraded his position on the stock to
neutral from moderately attractive. He also has slashed his
earnings estimate for 1991 to $3.50 a share from $4.25.
   A weak business climate isn't the only factor in PPG's
quarterly profit drop. In a terse statement projecting the
earnings decline, PPG said that its first-quarter net will
include a one-time gain relating to a change in accounting.
The company further stated that the impact of this gain will
be reduced "by charges for the realignment of various
operations."
   The company won't elaborate and declined to comment for
this column. PPG, however, has indicated to analysts that the
write-off will essentially negate the accounting gain.
   One lesson that PPG has learned is that overseas markets
don't help, because those markets can slump, too. New-car
sales are showing double-digit declines in three of PPG's
largest European markets, Italy, France and Britain. And in
the U.S., no amount of diversification can compensate for a
12.8% falloff in January housing starts.
   Some people apparently saw PPG heading for trouble. Steve
Pesek, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Management &amp; Research
Co., says the firm sold 3.5 million shares of PPG common last
summer. "Their primary markets are still cyclical," he says.
"They can't repeal the economic cycle."
