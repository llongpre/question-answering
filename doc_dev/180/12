IF EVER a painter had the luck of the gods, it was Henri Gervex. Son of a
Montmartre piano-maker, Gervex floated up through French society with the
effortlessness of Montgolfier's balloon. At his death in 1929 Gervex was
wealthy and fabulously well-connected. His daughter had married into the
aristocracy, and his paintings graced some of the grandest dining-rooms in
Europe.
Now, in a modest way, the Gervex balloon is once more on the way up, thanks
to an exhibition which has just opened in Bordeaux. (Next year, it travels
to Paris and Nice.) There has never been a retrospective of the great
arriviste, so tracking his canvasses to the homes of private collectors has
meant a good deal of sleuthing for the show's organisers. Not, however, that
Gervex is a totally unknown painter - above all, not in Bordeaux.
For half a century, 'Rolla', the large, frothy scene of the morning-after in
a cheap hotel, has been the most popular painting in the museum's collection
 -and star of the postcard sales, far surpassing Titian, Veronese and even
Delacroix's 'Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi'. There was a nasty moment
when it seemed that the newly created Musee d'Orsay might reclaim the
State's deposit, as it had every right to do. But Paris, mindful for once of
local sensibilities, stayed its hand.
Gervex was 26 in 1878 when he exhibited 'Rolla', unquestionably his
masterpiece, in the Salon. Already, he was well and truly launched after
winning a medal for the horribly squirming, but academically impeccable,
'Satyr playing with a Bacchante', which showed him to be every inch the
faithful pupil of the great Cabanel. But with 'Rolla', Gervex showed himself
to be now a true believer in Manet's gospel that artists must paint modern
life.
His nude, however, is no 'Olympia', the painting which over a decade before
had caused such a scandal. There was no risk of Gervex ever reneging on the
academic doctrine of ideal beauty of form in the matter of nudes. Throughout
his life, as we see in the upstairs rooms of the exhibition, paintings of
meltingly boneless nudes - usually redheads - were one of his stand-bys. In
old age, Gervex the dinosaur even reverted to Cabanalesque goddesses lolling
on the tops of waves.
It was with 'Rolla', however, that Gervex showed his uncanny gift for public
relations. It was banned as immoral, for reasons well explained by Hollis
Clayson in her interesting study of prostitution in French 19th-century
painting, 'Painted Vice' (Yale University Press). A prostitute in her
corset, like Manet's 'Nana', was tolerable; discarded corsets and
petticoats, with Monsieur Rolla's walking stick pointing at a provocative
angle, were quite another.
Undaunted, Gervex put it on exhibition in the Chaussee d'Antin; le tout
Paris was invited to see, and for weeks the street was filled with
carriages. Gervex was now a deliciously scandalous painter, in addition to
being a perfectly delightful human being. In the 1880s and '90s, Gervex was
irrepressible. The older generation of Impressionists loved him for his
raffishness.
Early success meant he could afford a famous mistress, Madame Valtesse de la
Bigne, whom we see in a large and glibly sub-Manet open-air portrait. He
thoughtfully introduced her to Zola, researching the background for his
immortal prostitute, Nana. Another little scandal, when he exhibited a
painting of a nude wearing a velvet mask, helped his reputation. Everyone
wanted to know whose wife she was, and a count sueing his sister for her
inheritance said she had been the sitter . . .
Gervex's industry was prodigious and he would never turn down a prestigious
commission, no matter how boring the subject. A brilliant stroke in 1889 was
to join up with the Belgian artist, Alfred Stevens, and paint a gigantic
'Panorama of the History of the Century', shown here in a modest copy from
Brussels.
Gervex had now shown himself as the republican patriot, honouring the
Revolution. People flocked to see it, and when a buyer did not come forward,
small pieces were given to each of the financial backers.
Clearly, here was the right artist to execute vast murals for public
commissions, such as still survive in the Hall of Weddings at the mairie of
the XIX arrondissement and the ceiling of the buffet of the Gare de Lyons.
Onwards and ever upwards, Gervex painted millionaire's salons and ceilings
for the Elysees Palace. In the Belle Epoque years, his undoubted talent for
painting electric light made him favoured choice for showing high society
dining in the Bois de Boulogne.
Portraits were bread and butter to Gervex, although he showed no very great
talent for them. Singer Sargent's bravura effects always eluded him. But
even as his commissions took him into the highest ranks of society - even
the Russian Royal Family, he still paid homage to early days. He was still,
a 'painter of modern life', follower - at however far a distance - of Degas
and Manet. Hence, we still find him painting scenes such as the wistful
cocotte, umbrella on the table, who anxiously awaits her companion for the
night in a smart restaurant in the Bois de Boulogne.
This is a hugely enjoyable exhibition, even though of a painter who rarely
rose above third-rate. Only now and then is he better than that, for
example, in oil sketches of his wife nursing their daughter or asleep on the
deck of the splendiferous yacht of the American tycoon, James Gordon Bennet.
The book accompanying the show will delight all who love the Belle Epoque,
and is rich above all in the contributions made by Gervex's great-grandson.
And do keep your eyes skinned; propped in a cellar, or hanging in some
drawingroom, you just might happen to see a nude in a black velvet mask or a
Nana look-alike dressing in a theatre loge . . . There are many Gervexes yet
to be unearthed; with a vengeance, the arriviste master is coming in from
the cold.
