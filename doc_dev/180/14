   Clorox Co. said profit in its fiscal third quarter ended March 31 rose 23% to $34.9 million, or 65 cents a share, from $28.4 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 10% to $325.5 million from $295.9 million. 

   For its nine months, profit increased 31% to $95.9 million, or $1.78 a share, from $73.3 million, or $1.37 a share. 
Sales rose 11% to $871.5 million from $784.3 million. 
Per-share earnings for both periods were adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split last June. 

   The Oakland, Calif.-based company attributed its improved performance to increased shipments of the company's household grocery brands, food service products, and internationally marketed brands. 

   The maker of food, household products and architectural paints and stains said it expects to report an "excellent" fiscal year. 
Clorox added it anticipates "good" operating results for its fourth quarter while it moves ahead with its introduction of Clorox Super Detergent.
