Clorox Co.: The Oakland-based home products maker said second-quarter earnings 
rose 6% from the previous year to $27.02 million.

Sales rose 9% to $295.6 million. The year-ago quarter's results reflected an 
operating loss from the Olympic paints and stain business, which was sold. The 
company said total shipments of its products -- including Clorox liquid bleach, 
Liquid plumr drain opener, Match Light and BBQ Bag charcoal briquettes and 
Hidden Valley Ranch bottled salad dressing -- were up.
