   A cat that apparently preferred France to
West Germany walked 620 miles to its old home here, the feline's
former owner says.
   Madeline Martinet said her cat, Gribouille, appeared on her
doorstep in this central French city this week, nearly two years
after he was reported missing from Reutlingen, a West German town
near Stuttgart.
   Gribouille was 2 months old when Mrs. Martinet gave him away in
July 1986 to her neighbor, who later moved to Reutlingen. The
former neighbor told Mrs. Martinet that the cat disappeared in
October 1986.
   ``My son and daughter-in-law found him sick and sleeping in
front of my front door'' on Sunday night, Mrs. Martinet said. ``My
son said, `Why, it's Gribouille.' Then the cat lifted its head and
cried.''
   A veterinarian said the cat had an eye infection, and prescribed
antibiotics. Despite the infection and malnutrition, the cat seems
to be recovering, Mrs. Martinet said.
   ``He has the same spots and a particular mew that he mews when I
speak to him,'' she said. ``It's definitely little Gribouille.''
   She said she told her former neighbor on Thursday that
Gribouille had been found.
   ``But this time, we are going to keep him,'' said Mrs. Martinet.
``I don't think he liked Germany.''

   Paint, pennants and props that were part
of the pomp of the 1984 Olympic Games now form the backdrop for
motorcycle races, courtesy of Summer Games buff Chris Agajanian.
   ``I love that Olympics stuff,'' said Agajanian, who owns Ascot
Park raceway in this Los Angeles suburb _ and $300,000 worth of
Olympics goods.
   There's bunting everywhere, shining in the still familiar
``clean aqua,'' ``hot magenta'' and ``rich chrome yellow'' hues
said by the planners of the 1984 Games to represent the Southern
California spirit.
   Brightly colored pennants hang on the walls between billboards
promoting spark plugs, chewing tobacco and bail bond agencies.
   The faded, scratched victory stands, which still have the
Olympic rings and star symbols visible, are planted in the race
track infield amid plastic pink flamingoes.
   Agajanian said that when he heard that a lot of the Olympic
furnishings were being auctioned, he started bidding.
   ``I ended up buying 5,000 seats from the swim stadium and some
of the ticket booths,'' he said recently. ``I got some tents. Some
flags. Some bunting. Some fencing. Some bullhorns.
   ``And I bought hundreds of gallons of Olympics paint. Used it
all over.''
   Agajanian has a collection of Olympic programs, ticket stubs,
parking passes, souvenir medallions and the like in a drawer in his
office.
   ``I've got more stuff in a warehouse,'' Agajanian said.
``Shirts. Uniforms. Even some of those blazers.
   ``But those colors? I'd never wear one of 'em.''
