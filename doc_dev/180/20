   PPG Industries Inc., trying to bolster its paint business, said it agreed to buy Grow Group Inc. for $16.625 a share, or about $233 million. 

   PPG said the assumption of Grow Group debt would bring its total cost to about $300 million. 

   Grow Group said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. acted as its adviser in evaluating the offer. 
Drexel was retained by Grow Group in July, shortly after an investor group including Edward S. Buchanan, a Massachusetts banker, said it had acquired a 6.7% stake and was considering a tender offer. 

   Last Thursday, Grow Group announced that it was in talks with a possible buyer. 
After the announcement, its stock jumped $2.625 to close at $15.625. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Grow Group closed at $15.50, off 12.5 cents. 
The PPG announcement was made after the market closed. 

   Grow Group has 14 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, including a Series C cumulative convertible preferred stock and 8.5% convertible debentures, both of which are expected to be redeemed before the merger. 
The Series C will be redeemed at $100 a share, and the convertible debentures, due in 2006, will be redeemed at $1,068 per $1,000 principal amount. 
The Series P nonredeemable cumulative preferred stock will remain outstanding. 

   Under the agreement approved by both boards, PPG has the option to buy about 2.8 million shares of Grow's authorized but unissued common at $16.625 a share. 
PPG also has the right to terminate the merger agreement during a due-diligence period ending Sept. 6. 

   The addition of Grow Group, a New York-based maker of trade paints and chemical coatings, should help expand PPG's own trade paint business. 

   Trade paints, used by consumers and contractors for homes and buildings, contribute only about $200 million of PPG's $5.2 billion in sales. 
But the company has been trying to expand its share of the market, which is $37 billion world-wide. 

   "Grow Group has strength in that business and we're looking for ways to improve our performance in that area," PPG said. 
About 70% of Grow Group's $380 million in sales is in the coatings and chemicals business, including trade paints. 
Grow Group also has a variety of consumer and professional products, including swimming pool chemicals, spray paints and varnishes. 

   John Frankola, an analyst with Parker Hunter Inc., said Grow Group will also provide PPG with a new distribution system. 
PPG changed its strategy for marketing its trade paints a few years ago by closing its retail Pittsburgh Paint stores. 
Since then, the company has been trying to establish new sources of distribution. 
"This could aid PPG in getting more trade paints into the market," he said.
