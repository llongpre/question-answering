   Clorox Co. said Henkel KGaA plans to increase its Clorox common stock holdings to as much as 30% from a current stake of 24.7%. 

   Dusseldorf, West Germany-based Henkel will acquire the shares through purchases on the open market, Clorox said, and won't increase its position beyond 30% "for the foreseeable future." 

   Clorox quoted the West German concern as saying Henkel views its holdings in the company as an investment, and has no plans to take an active role in Clorox management. 
Henkel will continue to have two representatives on Clorox's 15-member board. 

   A spokesman said Clorox views Henkel's increased stake as "a good development for the company and its shareholders." 
He cited a joint venture the two concerns operate in Spain and technology exchanges between the companies as evidence of the "close relationship" between them. 

   Clorox is a grocery products concern that also makes paints, stains and products for the food-service industry. 
Henkel produces household products and chemical specialties. 

   Henkel currently owns 23%, or an indicated 6,102,000, of Clorox's 26.7 million common shares outstanding. 
The West German concern also holds a subordinated note convertible into 600,000 common shares, or an about 1.7% additional stake. 

   Clorox said the 30% ceiling on Henkel's stake would include the equivalent shares represented by the note. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Clorox closed yesterday at $61.50, up $2.125.
