The closer one looks into the origins of anything the more ambiguous they
become, and the further back they go. Where should we look for the origins
of Impressionism? To the landscape and genre realism of the Dutch 17th
century? Certainly: and to the English 18th and early 19th centuries,
Gainsborough and Wilson, Constable and Turner? Indeed: and to late Titian?
Perhaps: and what about Rembrandt? Yes, if Courbet is to be considered in
such a context. And the Spanish connection, from Velasquez to Goya? Of
course, if Manet is to have anything to do with it.
But these are profound questions, that bespeak a whole ramification of
art-historical possibility. Whatever its implications, the splendid
exhibition at the Grand Palais addresses itself to a narrower period and
more immediate antecedents. This Origins of Impressionism is an exhibition
of French painting set in a French context, and one moreover that continues
ensemble the remarkable series by which the Reunion des musees nationaux,
these 15 years past, has been giving us definitive retrospective studies of
the Impressionist and post-Impressionist masters, one by one.
The starting point is the Salon of 1859 at which, of the future major
figures, only the young Pissarro was to be found. Ten years on and they were
all showing there, Monet and Manet, Renoir and Degas, almost as a matter of
course. The Salon indeed supplied the constant critical context for the art
of the period. The only pity is that more has not been made of it as an
actual presence: for the paintings taken to stand for it in 1859, which
include Bouguereau, Puvis de Chavannes, Corot, Delacroix, a
pre-Raphaelitesque Jules Breton and a magnificent large Daubigny riverscape,
are done with perfunctorily in the first two rooms.
Even so, the point is well made and two related myths usefully exploded:
that, though the Salon may have had its good years and its bad ('no
explosion: nothing of unknown genius' grumbled Baudelaire of 1859), it was
never entirely hostile to the young or controversial; and nor were the young
themselves averse to taking their chances of selection. And how close these
young painters were, in their several ways, to the more general
preoccupations of the day; and, as yet, how far from Impressionism. Here we
follow those interests through the 1860s, set out together in successive
galleries: history painting, with its admixture of symbolism; realism; the
nude; the portrait; the still-life; the landscape; the incidents of the
everyday.
The borders between these categories, of course, are never sealed nor even
clear, the cross-overs and mutual intrusions constant and instinctive. Degas
gives us a scene of medieval atrocity as conscientious in its detail as any
pre-Raphaelite, yet in the very pose of its nudes, it anticipates the figure
studies of his later years. The Manet of 'the Angels at the tomb of Christ'
is as dramatic in its presentation as a Caravaggio and, in the figure of
Christ himself, as confrontationally realist in its nudity as his own
'Olympia'.
This last, indeed, so provoked Courbet by her brazen, matter-of-fact
nakedness, that he replied with his own more suitably symbolic version of
the reclining and ecstatic woman, la Femme au perroquet. Manet replied in
his turn with his own 'Woman with a Parrot', though now a full-length
portrait of a young woman in a long white morning-gown, standing by her
pet's perch. All three are shown, altogether a most satisfying if
ill-tempered exchange of masterpieces.
The question of realism lies at the heart of it all. Yet in what does that
realism consist and to what degree should it be tempered? Is it the symbolic
realism of Degas' Spartan boys and girls of 1860, or is it the no less
symbolic but plein air realism of Bazille's young men at their bathing party
of 1869? Is the truth of modern life rather the boats and light dancing on
the water at la Grenouillere, of Renoir and Monet in 1869, or that of Degas'
darkly ambiguous interior, le Viol, of the same year? At the end of the
decade we find Courbet still committed to realism in its social aspect, with
his poor village woman in the snow, with her child and goat and bundle of
firewood. And there beside it is Monet's magpie sitting on the gate, and the
image simply of farm and field and hedgerow in the snow, all pink and blue
and violet shadow.
This is an exhibition full of wonderful, ravishing things. But set out as it
is, and quite rightly so, neither by chronology nor by artist but in
thematic groups, it raises a question it can hardly answer. Here was the
modern painting of the day, and young artists who knew each other and even
worked together, but were clearly doing different things. Realism and
symbolism, yes: and the formal portrait and the nude, and the landscape and
the genre scene: but Impressionism? Not quite yet: indeed, the more we look
into it, the more we wonder whether there was ever to be any such thing at
all.
