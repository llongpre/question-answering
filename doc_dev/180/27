<HEAD>Warhol's Red Marilyn Sells For $4 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andy Warhol's portrait, ``Red Marilyn,'' a 1964
depiction of Marilyn Monroe, brought $4 million at auction
Wednesday, a record for a work by the artist.
   The previous high for a Warhol painting was $3.9 million, said
Gloria Harris, a spokeswoman for Christie's. That painting sold
last year, also of the late actress, depicted her face 20 times and
is called ``Marilyn Monroe (Twenty Times).''
   ``Red Marilyn'' had a presale estimate value of between $1.5
million and $2 million. The actual selling price was $4,070,000,
Harris said.
   Harris said the auction Wednesday at Christie's fetched $31.7
million for 60 works of art. The auction of contemporary art
continues Thursday.
   ``Colored Alphabet,'' an oil and paper collage by Jasper Johns
sold for $3.5 million, the second highest price bid on Wednesday
but not a new record for a Johns.
   Other artist records at the Christie's auction included:
   _$715,000 for an Ellsworth Kelly painting, ``Black Triangle With
White.''
   _$880,000 for a Robert Motherwell painting, ``Elegy to the
Spanish Republic No. 134.''
   All prices include a 10 percent house commission.
   ``August Day,'' an oil on canvas painting by Franz Kline sold
for $2.7 million.
   A Jackson Pollock triptych, a series of three drip paintings on
three canvasses in black, red and yellow brought $2.2 million.
   ``Things on the Wall'' by Roy Lichtenstein sold for $1,012,000.
   The auction Wednesday at Christie's is the second day of a
12-day selling spree at that auction house and its rival _
Sotheby's. The two houses are expected to sell 4,400 pieces of art
for more than $500 million.
   On Tuesday, record prices were set for 27 contemporary artists
at Sotheby's. Total receipts of $78.6 million there set a record
for a contemporary art auction.
   Another Pollock drip painting, ``Number 8, 1950,'' painting sold
for $11.5 million at the Sotheby's auction.
   ``Triptych May-June,'' done by Francis Bacon in 1973, inspired
by the suicide of the artist's close friend, George Dyer, fetched
$6.2 million.
   Warhol's ``Red Jackie,'' which depicts a ruby-lipped Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis as First Lady in 1963, sold for $750,000 _ more
than twice its presale estimate.
   On Saturday, a Sotheby's sale of 20th Century decorative arts
will include a two-story town house commissioned in 1950 by Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller III.
   Christie's on May 10 and 11 will feature five Monets, seven
Picassos, 10 Renoir and four works by Degas.
