   The eye-popping sale of a Vincent van Gogh sunflower painting this month for $39.9 million has coaxed another major work by the Dutch artist onto the auction block. 

   The London-based auction house Christie's International PLC said it will auction off "Le Pont de Trinquetaille," an important painting of a bridge by van Gogh, on June 29 in London. 
A Christie's spokesman predicted that Le Pont will become "the second most expensive painting ever sold at auction." 
Christie's said the painting has been owned by the Kramarsky family of New York for more than 50 years. 

   Le Pont, once owned by van Gogh's sister-in-law, was shown at a major exhibition in Amsterdam in 1905 and eventually was bought by Siegfried Kramarsky in 1932 at a Paris sale. 

   Art specialists said the Kramarsky family's art collection is considered valuable but isn't well publicized. 
The collection was brought to the U.S. from Holland before World War II. 
Some of the works have been lent to museums. 
Le Pont has been on loan for the past three years to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 

   Christopher Burge, who runs Christie's in New York, is wary of predicting that this van Gogh work will engender the frenzied bidding of his sunflower painting, which is a more dazzling, brightly colored and better-known image. 
The sunflower painting was acquired by Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. of Tokyo. 

   The bridge painting, in muted grays and blues, "is an extremely subtle and quiet painting that requires contemplation," Mr. Burge said. 

   Nonetheless, Christie's expects this work easily to exceed the second-highest price ever paid for a work of art, $11 million, in December for a painting by Edouard Manet. 
And many art dealers believe that the price that this second van Gogh masterwork will fetch at auction will have a major influence on the art market in the near future. 

   "This will be a test of the previous price," New York art dealer Richard Feigen said. 
"If the price that this realizes reinforces the market level of the sunflowers, then you'll have a verification the other wasn't just a battle between two bidders." 
This, other dealers say, could unleash a lot of art onto the market. 

   Mr. Burge of Christie's said: "I think we made it clear to people that the van Gogh (sunflowers) was an isolated instance, and it doesn't make every other good impressionist painting worth $30 million to $40 million. 
But we've all been saying for some time that the art market will slow down, and you may see an element (in the near future) of profit-taking in the market, to use a horrid word."
