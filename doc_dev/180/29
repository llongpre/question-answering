   Artist Jackson Pollack's painting, ``The
Search,'' believed to be his last canvas, fetched $4.84 million _ a
record for a work of contemporary art _ in frenzied bidding at
Sotheby's Monday night, the auction house said.
   The auction, which included works put up for sale by various
owners as well as artist Andy Warhol's personal collection, brought
in $25,954,500, a record for an auction of contemporary art, said
Lucy Mitchell-Innes, the head of Sotheby's contemporary art
department.
   Record prices were set for works by 12 artists, including
Pollack, Warhol, Franz Kline, Cy Twombly, David Hockney and Richard
Diebenkorn. Six paintings sold for over $1 million, she said.
   ``The contemporary (art) world is now extremely aware of the
rarity of these really important paintings,'' she said. ``People
are very sensitive to the fact that these paintings won't come up
again. People know this is their last shot.''
   ``I've never seen the bidding as heated as it was this
evening,'' said Ms. Mitchell-Innes.
   The auction of Warhol's personal collection of contemporary art
brought in $5,115,000, with an untitled painting by Twombly
fetching $990,000, the highest bid for a Warhol-owned work.
   Pollack's ``Search,'' a canvas in tones of green, red, yellow,
black and white, was bought for $4.84 million by an anonyous
Japanese dealer, Ms. Mitchell-Innes said. The work, which displays
the artist's drip technique as well as paint applied with a brush
and spattered, had a pre-sale estimate of $3 million to $4 million.
   The previous record for a work of contemporary art sold at
auction was the $3.63 million for Jasper John's ``Out the Window''
in November 1986 and the same amount for Willem de Kooning's ``Pink
Lady'' in May 1987. Both paintings were sold at Sotheby's.
   The second highest bid at Monday night's auction was the $1.87
million an American dealer paid for Kline's ``Ninth Street,'' a
black and white abstraction, Sotheby's said. Its pre-sale estimate
was $700,000 to $900,000.
