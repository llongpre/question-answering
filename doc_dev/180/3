Clorox Puts Unit Up for Sale: Clorox Co. put its $106.8-million Olympic stain 
and Lucite paint business on the block, conceding that the subsidiary failed to 
live up to expectations. Clorox said it would solicit offers for its Olympic 
HomeCare Products subsidiary, which manufacturers and markets Olympic wood 
stains and Lucite interior and exterior house paint. Clorox bought Olympic in 
1981 for $123 million and added the Lucite brand in 1983 for $50 million. The 
products, although profitable, have performed poorly compared to the rest of 
Clorox's product line. This year, analysts expect the subsidiary's sales to 
drop to $100 million or less. One analyst said the division had only a 50% shot 
of turning a profit.
