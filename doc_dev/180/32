FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Celebration at the fairs - Business is booming at both
Grosvenor House and Olympia this year

No one is more surprised than the dealers. From Grosvenor House and Olympia
to the specialist Ceramics Fair at the Park Lane Hotel, the London art
market is humming. Last year, visitors to the Grosvenor House Art and
Antiques Fair idly inspected the odd item. But as the doors opened this
year, and those at the head of the queue purposefully strode in, it was
clear that business was about to be done.
It was clear, too, that the dealers were there to move their stock. Most
seem to have decided that they can no longer afford to use Grosvenor House
simply as a showcase. Gone are the Pounds 1m pictures, the Pounds 6m
sculpture, bravura displays of suites of powder blue and gilt Austrian
furniture. Truly exceptional works of art were relatively few, although
Angela von Wallwitz was rewarded by showing her spectacular Meissen wine
ewer in the form of a fantastical roaring beast. Modelled by JG Kirchner for
Augustus the Strong's Japanese Palace in Dresden around 1728 and over half a
metre high, this found a new home in the first two hours of the private
preview.
Most stands appealed to the middle of the market and recorded a high
turnover of less expensive items. Good 'brown' English furniture was, as
ever, the mainstay of the fair; Apter-Fredericks, for instance, sold half
his stand on preview day. The demand for jewels and precious objets d'art
appeared no less enthusiastic. By noon on the first day, New York-based A La
Vieille Russie had achieved sales exceeding the total of their business at
the 1993 fair and by the first weekend, silver dealers JH Bourdon-Smith had
sold 30 exhibits.
Much to the dismay of the Jeremiahs, the long-overdue abolition of dateline
restrictions this year did not alter the character of the fair. Instead it
treated us to Yves Mikaeloff's appropriately surreal display of the
petal-backed ebony armchairs that Sue and Marie created for a famous Paris
perfumery in 1923, and the traditional likes of the Phillip de Laszlo
portrait at the Christopher Wood Gallery. The most unexpected sight was the
bare buttocks and suspenders of an Allen Jones tucked in among the old and
modern masters at The Dover Street Gallery.
Far more dramatic was the transformation for the better of the appearance
and quality of experience at the fair. George Carter's elegant, understated
and unifying design gave the stands a more substantial feel (no more flimsy
partitions) and substantially higher ceilings. Even the air conditioning
seemed more efficient. The Grosvenor House Fair, which closes this Saturday
at 6pm, could not have hoped for a better Diamond Jubilee.
Over at Olympia, the Fine Art &amp; Antiques Fair could celebrate its 21st year
too. Long considered the poor relation of Grosvenor House, it has gone from
strength to strength, attracting ever more serious exhibits and visitors as
well as finding room for more off-beat collectables.
Here, too, furniture and silver enjoyed an exceptional year - some even
record sales. Silver dealers Marks Antiques, for example, sold a pair of
Paul Storr wine coolers for around Pounds 40,000, and two rare James I
goblets for the same sum. The fair drew a record 37,549 visitors - and
purchases out of the Metropolitan and Berlin Museums.
A similar tale was told at the International Ceramics Fair which got off to
a rip-roaring start on June 10. What was noticeable here, unlike Grosvenor
House, was that all the really good things seem to have sold, mostly on the
first day. English exhibits were far more interesting this year and the
quality of the French porcelain as good as ever. Crucially, prices were more
competitive too. It was the liveliest fixture in years.
Anyone doubting that it is still possible to find exceptional and relatively
inexpensive works of art on the market should make a pilgrimage to Agnew's
current show, Arte Sacra Antica (43 Old Bond Street, W1, until July 22). In
pride of place among this small but choice group of 14th and 15th century
panel paintings, illuminated manuscripts and maiolica hangs a 'lost'
crucifixion by Gentile da Fabriano, the leading Gothic painter in Italy. The
panel, its gold ground overpainted, had been sold at Phillips in 1991,
catalogued as workshop of Ugolino di Nerio, for Pounds 68,000.
The Crucifixion has been identified as the crowning panel of Gentile's
partially re-assembled 'Valle Romita' altarpiece of 1410-12 in the Brera
Gallery, Milan, where it was on display last year. Despairing of a sale, or
perhaps to force the Italians' hand, the painting is on offer in London at
Pounds 2.5m.
