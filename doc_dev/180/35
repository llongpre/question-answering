   A religious group has ended a nine-month
boycott of Clorox Co. products, citing a marked reduction in the
company's sponsorship of ``sex, violence, profanity and
anti-Christian stereotyping'' on television.
   But the boycott ``was a success in both dropping the sales of
Clorox products and in encouraging Clorox to enforce their
advertising policy,'' said Billy Melvin, executive director of
National Association of Evangelicals and chairman of the group
known as Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, or CLeaR-TV.
   Without disclosing whether the boycott cut into sales, Clorox
communications director Fred Reicher said, ``certainly we are
gratified the boycott has been lifted. The boycott made us aware
that implementation of our standards were flawed and we tightened
those.''
   CLeaR-TV describes itself as a coalition of 1,600 Christian
leaders with constituencies totaling 60 million people.
   The Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, a United Methodist preacher who
founded the group and serves as its executive director, said the
organization would continue a one-year boycott of products made by
the Mennen Co., also accused of sponsoring what the group sees as
objectionable television programming.
   When the boycotts were announced nine months ago, CLeaR-TV said
it had found the two manufacturers had placed advertisements on
offensive television programs from April 27 through May 24, a
``sweeps'' period during which the popularity of network
programming is gauged.
   Programs considered particularly offensive during that period _
both carrying advertising by the targeted companies _ included
NBC-TV's ``Miami Vice'' and ``Dream Street,'' Melvin had said.
   CLeaR-TV said it found a reduction of almost two-thirds in the
amount of sex, violence and profanity sponsored by Clorox last fall
as compared with last spring.
   The group said it had been approached by Clorox officials in
February noting that standards had been tightened and requesting
that the boycott be lifted.
   Clorox, whose products include bleach, Act laundry detergent,
Formula 409 cleaner and Lucite paint, ranked 66th among the leading
national advertising spenders at $148 million in 1988, according to
the trade publication Advertising Age.
