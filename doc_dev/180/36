The Latino art exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is a landmark 
event. The show, on national tour, is the largest art exhibition of U.S. 
Latinos ever assembled. 
</P>
<P>
"This exhibition did not happen by accident," said Howard Fox, the museum's 
curator of contemporary art. "This exhibition is an idea whose time is here." 
</P>
<P>
But at least one prominent artist complains that the museum's attention to 
Latino art is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum has demonstrated a lack of genuine interest and support for the 
Hispanic artistic community," said Carlos Almaraz, whose work is part of the 
exhibit. He pointed out that the last major Latino art exhibition there was 15 
years ago, when the museum featured "Los Four" -- local Chicano painters 
Almaraz, Frank Romero, Gilbert Lujan and Roberto de la Rocha. 
</P>
<P>
So while a large crowd toasted the exhibition on opening night, Almaraz 
boycotted the gala. "Why go to the opening?" Almaraz asked. "To say what great 
things it (the museum) has done for Hispanics? No!" 
</P>
<P>
However, he commended Jane Livingston and John Beardsley, who organized the 
show for Houston's Museum of Fine Arts. The two, curators of the Corcoran 
Gallery of Art in Washington, were "instrumental and supportive for the 
creation of this exhibition. They had the critical eyes to look at art and not 
at the politics." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, "Hispanic Art in the United States: Thirty Contemporary 
Painters and Sculptors," continues until April 16. 
</P>
<P>
The art in the exhibition is gripping. It is vivid. It is powerful and real. 
With exuberant colors, the paintings seem to scream from the walls. The exhibit 
covers the spectrum from the photorealist narrative to the abstract. Although 
its roots are in the past, it is unapologetically contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a richness in this exhibition that defies categorization. Every 
artist shown here is an artist of merit. This is a robust, diverse, impassioned 
exhibition," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exhibition of American and Latino art in a slightly different 
language," Beardsley said. "It is a language of forms and contents that 
portrays the Latino experience in the United States. Its strength consists in 
that it is both American and Latino art. 
</P>
<P>
"Something in the tension between the so-called dominant culture and the other 
contributes to the strength in the work," Beardsley said. "The hybridization in 
the language is one of the real strengths. Tension between cultures generates 
power in the artistic expression that emerges from it." 
</P>
<P>
There is a growing consensus that art does not have to be created by "the 
in-crowd" in New York City to be acceptable. Los Angeles artist Romero, whose 
painting "The Closing of Whittier Boulevard" is in the exhibit, says, 
"Corporate America is very insecure with images. I'm breaking into corporate 
collections with narrative pieces that tell a story, which makes the art 
controversial. In this way, the mainstream is coming to Hispanic art, and not 
the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
In the context of this exhibition, however, Fox said, "There is no way to 
identify a mainstream within the art world, any more than it is possible to 
identify a mainstream culture." 
</P>
<P>
Gronk, a Los Angeles Chicano artist who uses only one name, said, "Chicano art 
is part of the American culture, and it goes unrecognized in the United States. 
I'm out to break the stereotypes of what it is that we Latinos are supposed to 
be like. In its diversity, this exhibition communicates that visually. 
</P>
<P>
"A contemporary plastic artist is a visual philosopher for our time," added the 
artist, whose works are part of the exhibition. "This show is a success because 
it brought this point to the attention of a lot of people in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Another artist, Texas-born Carmen Lomas Garza, considers herself a curandera, a 
healer. "I want to depict in a fine art form all those aspects of my culture 
that are positive and important for others to see and gain an understanding of 
who I am as a Chicano artist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Through one of her paintings, the "Curandera," she attempts to convey a special 
message. "In South Texas, we'd all go to medical doctors to get prescriptions 
for drugs. But we'd go to the curandera for the final cleansing. It is a 
spiritual cleansing. A healing. 
</P>
<P>
"Artistically, I have tried to heal myself and other Chicanos and Latinos from 
the damage that was done to us in the form of discrimination and oppression," 
she said. "I continue the tradition of making home altars honoring the Day of 
the Dead. I paint scenes depicting family customs. My art work shows the 
dignity of my humanness." 
</P>
<P>
The 145 paintings, sculptures and assemblages in the exhibition portray 
survival, anxiety and hope; confusion, identity, anger and love. These are all 
expressions of deep-seated feelings, convictions, struggles and emotions that 
reflect Latino life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Diversity is also present in the materials and techniques employed by these 
artists. Among the artists, John Valadez, a Chicano muralist and a colorful 
urban painter, displays "La Butterfly," a realistic reflection of Chicano 
street scenes in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Gonzalez's oil paintings draw from landscape imagery of her native 
Colombia. Felix Lopez and Luis Tapia, both from the Southwest, make brightly 
colored religious wood carvings known traditionally as santos. Gregorio Marzan 
of Puerto Rico constructs mixed-media animal figures in vivid colors. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Jimenez of El Paso works on painted animal sculptures and human figures on 
painted fiberglass. Californian Manuel Neri's sculptures involve the human 
figure with rough surfaces. Robert Graham, who was born in Mexico City and is 
best known for his 1984 Olympic bronze statues, stands out as the most 
realistic sculptor of this group. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing that strikes the attention of a viewer at the entrance to the 
show is Lujan's elaborately decorated 1950 Chevy. Lujan two-door sedan features 
a "flaming jalapeno paint job" in the front and a Chicano couple along the 
side. "Our Family Car," Lujan said, is symbolic of "the social dynamics, an 
entire culture built around cars." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the artists believe that this tour will be looked upon as a turning 
point of art in the United States. In the future, Gronk said, "labels, such as 
Hispanic, will fall on the wayside. People will see that this is American art."
