   NEW YORK -- Works by name artists sold for 25% off at
Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s major fall sale of contemporary art
last night.
   More than three-quarters of the paintings and sculpture
found buyers, making this sale the most successful major sale
of the two-week auction season, which ends today.

   But about half the works sold at a fraction of the presale
price estimates, including works by Ellsworth Kelly, Brice
Marden and Philip Guston. Sotheby's expected the total sale
to fetch about $32 million to $40 million. Instead, $24.4
million of art sold in the lengthy sale. Of the 82 paintings
and sculpture brought to the auction block, 20 failed to
sell.
   Eli Broad, head of insurer and financial services firm
Broad Inc., purchased a Roy Lichtenstein for $935,000. The
piece, "Non Objective One," an homage to artist Piet
Mondrian, was expected to sell for $1.2 million to $1.6
million. Mr. Broad said he believed the painting would have
brought $3 million at the height of the art market boom about
two years ago.
   German collectors were active at the sale, said Diana D.
Brooks, president of Sotheby's North and South American
auction operations. Bidding was aggressive for minimalist
sculptures and for works by Georg Baselitz, a leading German
expressionist painter.
   Mrs. Brooks said the firm was "extremely pleased" with the
results. Now, "we have a good sense of what price levels
artists should be estimated at in the future."
   "Jubillee," a Jasper Johns collage featuring the names of
colors stenciled on fabric painted shades of gray, met
expectations by bringing in $5 million. Considered by some
art dealers to be the most important work for sale this
auction season, it had a presale estimate of $4 million to $5
million.
   The painting featured by Sotheby's catalog was Robert
Rauschenberg's "Small Red Painting," a "combine" painting of
a red umbrella plastered with paint, postcards, comic strips
and topped by a lightbulb. It was expected to fetch $1.8
million to $2.2 million, but failed to sell at auction and
was sold privately for $1.3 million to art dealer William
Acquavella.
   A familiar face back on the auction block was Andy
Warhol's "Red Jackie." Hammered down at Sotheby's just two
years ago for $825,000, it was back on the block by order of
a creditor. This time, it sold for $352,000, including a 10%
premium paid to Sotheby's, against a presale price estimate
of $300,000 to $350,000.
