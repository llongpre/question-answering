<LEADPARA>  Q I have a home with finished aluminum soffits, fascias, gutters and window
trim. I would like to paint these a different color. Is this possible? And, if
so, will I be repainting every four years and lose out on the benefits of
aluminum trim?;    A Not to worry. PPG Industries has a latex paint
specifically formulated for repainting prefinished aluminum siding and trim.
It's called Metal Siding Refinish, and comes in a variety of colors to match
current popular siding colors. If the surface is prepared correctly and the
paint properly applied, it will last for about 10 years. This compares
favorably with many older types of prefinished aluminum siding which required
painting after about 10 years. The product can also be used on unfinished
aluminum after applying a primer.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q I would like to install a strip oak tongue-and-groove floor on top of an
above-grade concrete slab. However, I've heard horror stories of costly wood
floors buckling from moisture. How can I avoid problems caused by moisture
that might accumulate in the area under the slab?;    A A hardwood floor can
be installed on a concrete slab at or above grade. The Oak Flooring Institute
recommends against below-grade installations.;    Moisture is the chief
culprit in hardwood floor buckling, so test the slab for dryness. Tape one
square foot of clear polyethylene sheet to the slab, sealing its edges with
plastic tape. If after 24 hours, no clouding or moisture droplets have formed
under it, the slab is dry enough to install a wood floor.;    To prevent
moisture from reaching the underside of the hardwood floor, place a vapor
barrier of either building felt or polyethylene plastic over the slab prior to
installation.;    Q The outside of my home is covered with wood-grain aluminum
siding. In a few areas, the bottom edges of the siding have developed a white
chalklike substance. What is it, can I prevent it from spreading and how do I
remove it?;    A The chalky substance is a layer of dead paint pigments along
the bottom edges of the siding. It is not aluminum corrosion. Over time, the
siding's paint weathers, developing a dead pigment layer on the surface.
Particles of dead paint are washed off by rain and accumulate along the
siding's bottom edges.;    Wash the siding periodically with a solution of
1/3-cup detergent, 2/3-cup triphosphate (such as Soilax), 1 quart Clorox and 3
quarts of warm water.;    Since the baked-on paint systems used on aluminum
siding are somewhat similar to automotive finishes, dull finishes exposed to
severe weathering can be protected with an automotive wax.  </TEXT>
