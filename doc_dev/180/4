   Clorox Co. expects to report net income for the quarter and year ended June 30 fell from a year-earlier, reflecting a write-down from the anticipated sale of its Olympic paints division. 

   The household-product concern's net for the year-ago quarter totaled $36.5 million, or 67 cents a share. 
Fourth-quarter sales rose about 15% from $360.8 million a year earlier. 

   Net for the previous year was $130.9 million, or $2.39 a share. 
Sales grew 18% from $1.15 billion the previous year. 

   Results for the prior periods were restated to reflect exclusion of the Olympic division's results as well as the exercise of a note by Henkel KGaA, a West German household-product and chemical company owning about 27.3% of Clorox's 55.4 million common shares outstanding. 

   William F. Ausfahl, group vice president and chief financial officer, said that in fiscal 1989, Clorox shipped record volumes of several established product lines, including liquid bleach, cat litter and barbecue sauce. 
Improved performance also reflects the absence of some charges against equipment and foreign investments taken in last year's fourth quarter. 

   "So our continuing businesses are very healthy," he said. 
However, the company lavished its highest-ever level of spending on several new product introductions -- including its Clorox Detergent, still in test-markets in the West, Southwest and Southeast. 
The detergent has prompted a round of competitive products and promotions by giant Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and others. 
Thus, the anticipated date of the detergent's national introduction is still a closely guarded secret "for competitive reasons," Mr. Ausfahl added. 

   The planned sale of the Olympic paints division, a strategic move to concentrate on core household and food-service businesses is pending. 
The sale for an as-yet undetermined price will result in a write-down of unknown size, Mr. Ausfahl said. 

   This anticipated write-down -- which he declined to discuss -- depressed net to below last year's periods, "but we will still be profitable," he added. 

   Analysts have estimated that the paint division could fetch anywhere from $70 million to $120 million, but Clorox won't comment on such speculation. 
The company said it is still reviewing bids from several potential buyers.
