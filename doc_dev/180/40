   Christie's auction house held its first-ever sale
of Spanish paintings on Friday, and a lighthearted ``picture within
a picture'' fetched the highest individual price of $233,000.
   The 170 paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries reaped a total
of $2.1 million, with prices ``well beyond expectations,'' said a
Christie's statement.
   The most expensive work, Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta's ``En El
Estudio'' (In the Studio), ``reverses the role of portraiture,''
Christie's said.
   It depicts one of the artist's favorite models dressed in a
sweeping, salmon-colored gown, standing in front of her own
unfinished portrait and drawing a caricature of the artist on the
canvas.
   The painting's price of $233,000 was $56,000 more than its
highest estimate, Christie's said. The auction house did not provide
the year of the painting. The artist lived from 1841 to 1920.
   The highest price paid for a religious painting was $214,000 for
a sumptuous depiction of a candlelight ceremony honoring a saint,
titled ``Celebrating Santa Maria Della Rosa.''
   The artist, Jose Benlliure y Gil, lived from 1855 to 1914.
