   Clorox Co. said Henkel Corp., a unit of Henkel KGaA of West Germany, is converting its $9 million of 12% Clorox subordinated debt into 1.2 million common shares. 
The transaction increases to 26.5% from about 25% Henkel's stake in Clorox's shares outstanding. 

   Clorox, a maker of household grocery and food-service products and architectural paints and stains, said Henkel's move is consistent with the West German company's previously stated goal of increasing its Clorox ownership to 30%.
