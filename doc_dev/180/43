Jerald Silva's masterfully painted watercolor nudes are caught somewhere 
between Ingres' psychological portraits and strictly formal figure studies 
toying with light, form and technique. Confusion arises because the female 
figures are so often bland individuals at the mercy of the artist's technical 
display. Yet occasionally they survive the assault with dogged inner strength.

This intensity enlivens the somewhat languid action in paintings like "Woman 
Rising," where a seated nude, gazing determinedly straight ahead, is pictured 
about to push off from a red chair directly at the viewer. Behind her on a 
steam-fogged picture window are wet, drippy finger marks that catch her 
willpower and radiate like an expressionistic halo.

Silva's dexterity with the figure and his ability to make watercolor steam drip 
is wonderful. Loose, but accurate he can make color imitate just about any 
light effect. Yet it's only when he stops fiddling with all the gee-whiz 
effects and settles in to say something that the paintings really come to life. 
His steamy "Olympia" is a wonderful visual pun on sexuality. Most moving is a 
cunning and unsympathetic self-portrait. (Andrea Ross Gallery, 2110 Broadway, 
to Oct. 21.) SUVAN GEER
