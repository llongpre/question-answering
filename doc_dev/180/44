WHAT DID Titian feel in the autumn of 1510 on hearing that Giorgione had
died of plague? Perhaps he mourned for 'Big George' who, as Vasari wrote,
'taught everything he knew with love' and revolutionised painting in Venice,
even though he was still in his early 30s when he died. Yet Titian must have
reflected that there now was no rival to stand in the way of his acceptance
as supreme painter of Venice. And so began truly The Century of Titian, the
title of the magnificent exhibition which can be seen in Paris and nowhere
else.
It would be rash to prophesy that decades must elapse before there is
another comparable exhibition of Venice's Golden Age. Nonetheless, it is
certain that this exhibition had remarkable leverage in securing loans,
thanks to the prestige of its organiser, Michel Laclotte. For this last
exhibition before his retirement, the director of the Louvre has been
calling in the favours, winkling out important paintings which have not been
lent for over a generation, and in some cases have barely been seen this
century.
Room after room of the Grand Palais is hung with masterpieces from Venice's
golden age, among them some of the best-loved paintings of the Italian
Renaissance, such as Titian's 'Flora' from the Uffizi and his 'Venus at her
Toilette' from Washington. Titian dominates, but this is not to say that it
is his show alone.
The Royal Academy's Splendour of Venice in 1983-4 produced not one
Giorgione, but some fine paintings from his circle. In contrast, Paris
offers an entire room hung with 17 Giorgiones, among them the mysterious
'Sunset Landscape' from London and the exquisite Laura, bare-breasted in a
fur-lined coat - a courtesan, a Virtue, or even, as some would have it, a
marriage portrait. As for the bitterly lamenting old woman, 'La Vecchia,' it
seems odd that anyone could think this is Giorgione's portrait of his
mother. However, the enormous catalogue (FFr390, Pounds 47.15) reveals that
this is the opinion of the Italian scholar, A. Ballarin, on whose views of
Giorgione and Titian the exhibition is more or less closely based.
But then, Giorgione is an endlessly mysterious artist. Hanging such a room
amounts to throwing down the gauntlet a dozen times - assuming that certain
paintings such as the San Diego 'Portrait of a Man,' with its immensely
delicate sfumato effect, are certainly by him. But whoever one plumps for,
there is no gainsaying the extraordinarily powerful effect of a wall of five
portraits of beautiful, narcissistic, moody young men, among them the famous
Gattemalata from the Uffizi and the hand-on-heart youth from the National
Gallery in Budapest.
The rooms which follow trace the influence of Giorgione, above all on
Sebastiano del Piombo and on young Titian. The hornets of controversy buzz
loudest of all at the point where the famous 'Concert Champetre' from the
Louvre is said to be by Titian, and the 'Susannah and Daniel' from Glasgow.
The unique pleasure of any such exhibition is to see wonderful paintings
hanging together, commenting on each other. The 'Concert' and the 'Susanna'
look less like Titian, to my eye, for being shown alongside the newly
cleaned sacra conversazione from Mamiano di Traversatolo. Here is the artist
of the Frari Assumption, totally confident in his harmonious grouping of
monumental figures, and gifted above all with the surpassing use of colour.
Separate sections on middle and late Titian include such rarities as a
portrait of Laura Dianti, Alfonso d'Este's mistress, and 'St Margaret,'
stepping out of the dragon's jaws while behind her is the view of a burning
city as brilliantly impressionistic as anything from late Titian's brush.
Interspersed are copious selections of other artists of the Veneto who fell
under (or in Lotto's case, rejected), the spell of Giorgione and Titian.
The Louvre has lent much, including the 'Man with a Glove'. Its 'Venus of
the Pardo' can be seen with the two triumphantly erotic mythologies from the
Prado, 'Danae' and 'Venus with Cupid and and Organist'. In all there are 150
paintings, and two rooms of 120 exceptionally fine prints and drawings.
Le Siecle de Titien is attracting some 4,000 visitors daily so you should
expect a queue. However, the show is spaciously hung which means that the
crowd soon thins out. Wastage is helped by the fact that there are
disgracefully few seats. This may be a mundane point, but it is nonetheless
a serious one.
Increasingly, doubts are expressed about the wisdom of exposing works of art
to the risks of travel. In the last analysis, then, the justification for
blockbuster exhibitions has to be the joy they give the public. So why, one
might ask, are curators the world over so indifferent to their visitors'
comfort? Le Siecle de Titian is, I am afraid, a classic example.
The labels are so small that opera glasses are a good idea. And if possible,
plan to visit more than once - not that there is a season ticket option,
which also seems ungenerous. At the least, husband your strength, for the
final room of the exhibition deserves not to be skimped. Hung against a
nasty royal blue background, are the unsettling works of four great painters
in their old age. Of Veronese there is the tender, quiet-toned 'St Pantaleon
curing a Child' and 'Christ in the Garden of Olives'. Counter-Reformation
spirituality speaks with a more troubling voice in the nocturnal scenes by
Tintoretto and Bassano. Among the masterpieces of Titian's final two decades
are 'Venus and Adonis' from the Metropolitan, the newly restored 'Venus
Bandaging the Eyes of Cupid,' the Detroit 'Ecce Homo,' and 'St Jerome' from
the Escorial.
Above all, there is 'The Flaying of Marsyas,' the painting which in a decade
of travel around the world has awakened a deep response in art lovers, few
of whom would ever see it at home in Kromeric in the Czech Republic. Surely,
then, it should have been possible to provide a perch?
Prestigious block-buster shows look set to continue despite the opposition
of hard-line conservationists. Indeed, their arguments look mean-spirited in
the face of an exhibition like this, which offers such a deep and rich
encounter with one of the most exciting periods in western art. And yet, at
the same time, it also underlines the need for curators to take a less
Olympian attitude to their eager but footsore public.
Exhibition ends 14 June; open daily (except Tuesdays), 10-8, Thursdays
10-10. Sponsored by ICI France.
