FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Paint manufacturers learn the
oldest lesson of all - A sector shake-up has shown that the customer must
still come first

New technology is not enough. Without a network of customers to sell to,
innovators are doomed to licensing.
So said Mr Alex Ramig, one of the US's most respected industrial chemists,
when discussing ICI's pollution-reducing car paint Aquabase in 1991.
Yesterday, his words proved prophetic - although Mr Ramig, who was picked up
by ICI when it bought the US paint giant Glidden in 1986 and now heads
paints research, was part of making them so.
ICI has withdrawn from a joint venture to provide paints for European car
makers, leaving Du Pont, its US partner, to go it alone with an Aquabase
licence. Du Pont already has a network of customers in the US on which to
base a marketing strategy.
ICI quit after a four-year programme to adapt Aquabase - which uses water
instead of organic solvents - for the vehicle repair market. It already has
a customer network of thousands of vehicle repair shops worldwide and thinks
it will do better. The move marks the latest stage of a 12-year
reorganisation of world industrial paint markets.
Industrial paints are high technology products, and big business. Modern
anti-corrosion guarantees rely on a vehicle's paint, and paint used during
manufacture in Europe alone is worth about Pounds 650m (Dollars 969m) a
year. Vehicle repair worldwide generates annual sales of about Pounds 2bn.
As manufacturers of vehicles, televisions sets, video recorders, and
consumer durables 'went global' in the 1980s, their suppliers - paintmakers
included - were forced to follow suit. The result was a rash of mergers and
acquisitions as giants such as ICI and Courtaulds of the UK, PPG and Du Pont
of the US, BASF and Herberts of Germany and Akzo of the Netherlands, bought
their way into national paint markets around the world.
A vigorous shakeout is now under way. Research and development has to be
continuous and is expensive; each company is concentrating on markets where
it has the best prospects, shedding businesses which cannot justify their
consumption of working capital.
Even the acquisitive Netherlands chemical company Akzo - which last year
bought Sweden's Casco Nobel, which in turn had swallowed Beckers to dominate
Scandinavian markets - is trying to sell its European manufacturing
automotive coatings business to PPG, the world market leader.
Mr Austin O'Malley, who heads PPG's European paints operations, said
yesterday the deal was now only waiting for the approval of the Netherlands
and Belgian governments. Go-ahead will trigger big PPG investment in Akzo's
former plant and laboratories.
Courtaulds, best known for the International Paint brand of marine coatings,
has turned itself into a transportation sector specialist. It bought ICI's
aircraft painting business in 1992. It is also a leader in powder coatings -
which use no solvents, so are the most environmentally friendly of all.
ICI decided to go for powder markets, too. In 1992 it tried to merge its
powder business with Ferro, the US leader, but withdrew after doubts over
management structure and capital needs. It then sold the business to Ferro.
The lesson - that technology alone does not make a market - is shown in an
ICI success story. Glidden developed an environmentally friendly, inert,
tasteless, water-based lacquer for spraying the insides of aluminium drinks
cans, which separates the contents from the metal of the can and ensures
that the drink tastes the same worldwide.
Thanks to Glidden's long standing as a supplier to the canning industry, and
ICI's similar position in the rest of the world, ICI now has 44 per cent of
the US market and 32 per cent in Europe.
