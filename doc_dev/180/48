Competition in the European market for painting cars during manufacture  -
worth about Pounds 650m (Dollars 975m) a year - is likely to intensify
following the German and Dutch authorities' approval last week of the sale
of Akzo's share in the business to PPG, the US industrial coatings
specialist.
The takeover, now in the final stages of European Union approval, will
reduce numbers of principal competitors to three - PPG; Herberts, the
industrial coatings subsidiary of Hoechst, the German chemicals group; and
BASF, another big German chemicals company.
This rationalisation will allow each group to step up the fight for market
share.
Although Herberts and BASF dominate their national market, PPG is believed
to have at least 35 per cent of total European sales, while industry sources
estimate Herberts' European share at around 25 per cent and BASF's as
approaching 20 per cent.
Akzo claimed a 9 per cent share. ICI withdrew from the market last month
when it abandoned IDAC, a six-year joint venture with Du Pont based near
Cologne. Du Pont will continue alone, with what was claimed as an 11 per
cent share at the time of the break-up.
Mr Austin O'Malley, managing director of PPG's European business, said
yesterday he was expecting vigorous competition as PPG hurried to integrate
Akzo technology, products, research and development.
PPG's tactic will be to offer manufacturers the chance to completely
outsource the painting process at a lower cost than buying materials and
technical support at competitive prices and doing the job themselves, as
now.
PPG's acquisition of Akzo's business - coupled with an earlier alliance with
Bollig and Kempe, a German spray painting specialist - will give it a full
range of all the products and technologies involved.
