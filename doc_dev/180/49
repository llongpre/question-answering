   A 16th century painting by Lucas
Cranach the Elder worth $200,000 was stolen from Prague's National
Gallery, a newspaper said Thursday.
   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said ``An Enamored Old Man,''
painted by the German master in 1531, disappeared on Wednesday.
   Czechoslovak radio and television announced the theft in news
bulletins, describing the missing picture. Customs authorities also
were alerted, the daily said.
   The Gallery's 13,500 paintings in several locations in Prague
include Rubens' ``Gathering of the Olympic Gods'' and Titian's
``Lady at her Toilet.'' They make up what is considered one of the
finest collections of medieval art in central Europe.
   Czechoslovakia has become a popular target for international
crime after the revolution last year that lifted travel
restrictions and eased police controls.
   ``Problems with guarding valuable works of art in the National
Gallery have apparently not yet been solved,`` the daily said.
