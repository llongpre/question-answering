   For the second day in a row, a record price was
paid for a Jasper Johns painting: $17.05 million for the oil titled,
``False Start,'' Sotheby's announced.
   The sale of the canvas painting, painted in 1959 shortly after
Johns' first one-man show at Leo Castelli Gallery in 1958, occurred
during a record-setting auction of contemporary art Thursday, said
Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America.
   It was the highest amount ever paid for a painting by a
contemporary artist, Ms. Brooks said.
   ``It was always a jewel,'' she said of the painting, which
features splashes of color and the angled stencils of the words of
various colors.
   The painting, which had been owned by private collectors, was
part of a $66.3 million sale that set a record for a contemporary
art auction, she said. She declined to name the winning bidder.
   More than 3,000 people crowded into a main hall and two other
sales rooms to participate in the bidding, she said.
   Ms. Brooks said it was ``one of the most amazing auctions'' she
had seen.
   ``The breadth of this market is something we had expected was
there, but it was confirmed tonight by the prices that were paid,''
Ms. Brooks said.
   Besides the contemporary art sale, a separate auction was
conducted for paintings from the collection of Victor W. Ganz, who
died in 1987.
   A dozen paintings from the collection, started in 1947, were sold
for $48.5 million. About $16 million of the amount was included in
the total for the night for contemporary art, bringing the total
night's sales to $98.5 million, said Sotheby's spokeswoman Diana
Levitt.
   Also at Thursday's sale, a record $3.96 million for an Andy
Warhol painting was paid for a silkscreen canvas titled, ``Marilyn
Monroe (Twenty Times),'' Ms. Levitt said. The painting shows the
face of the actress 20 times.
   Records were also set for 15 other artists, Ms. Levitt said.
   On Wednesday, a Swedish art collector paid $7.04 million for a
painting by Johns of an all-white American flag, Christie's said.
   Hans Thulin, chairman of a Swedish real estate conglomerate, put
down the winning bid for the painting, ``White Flag.''
   The sale price of ``White Flag,'' which was estimated to be worth
$5 million to $8 million, stood for one day as the most ever paid
for a work of contemporary art and the most ever paid for a work by
a living artist, according to Christie's.
   Johns' ``Diver,'' which sold for $4.18 million in May, held the
previous records.
