When Imperial Chemical Industries pulled out of IDAC, a Pounds 50m joint
venture in Germany with Du Pont, the US chemicals giant, in January, it was
one of three events finally defining the structure of the world's paint
industry, after 12 years of turmoil.
IDAC was set up in 1988 to attack the Pounds 650m European market for
painting cars on the assembly line - automotive OEM, or original equipment
manufacture. The venture failed to reach the 20 per cent market share ICI
needed to justify staying in the market.
Another of the three events had already deprived ICI of its seven-year-old
title as the world's biggest paintmaker: in November, Akzo of the
Netherlands took over the coatings business of Nobel of Sweden, astutely
merging two portfolios of products that had little overlap between them.
Akzo, however, is not obsessed by 'sizism,' as the third event showed: it
sold its European automotive OEM business to PPG, the market's US-owned
world market leader. Automotive OEM is now dominated in Europe by PPG, and
the German paintmakers BASF and Herberts.
ICI and Akzo Nobel are both strong in another branch of automotive paints -
vehicle refinish, or VR, where ever-higher technology coatings are used for
repairing damaged vehicles. Mr Louis McCulloch, senior partner of James
Consulting, an independent specialist on the paint industry, says their exit
from OEM was like slaughtering a sacred cow.
The two main pillars of the paint industry are the entirely separate markets
of decorative and automotive paints. The former is a low technology, high
volume cash generator; the latter is a high technology industrial market,
where partnership and symbiotic technical services are essential between
paintmakers, vehicle manufacturers and the suppliers of painting equipment.
Like Mr McCulloch, ICI's former OEM partner Du Pont, and OEM competitors
like PPG, BASF and Herberts, all believe the OEM and VR markets are
interdependent, if only to get car manufacturers to recommend specific
companies' VR products as part of their anti-corrosion guarantees.
Mr Herman Scopes, chief executive of ICI Paints, disagrees: 'Of the 10 top
VR companies in the world, four - ICI, Akzo, Sherwin Williams and Rock Paint
 -do not have any OEM. The link is more perceived than real,' he says.
His doubters say Sherwin Williams and Rock are each rooted in their large,
respective home markets of the US and Japan - and were the exceptions
proving the rule.
ICI and Akzo retort that the markets are entirely different. There is only a
tiny number of car manufacturers worldwide, but thousands of body shops.
Distribution, service, logistics and the ability to handle tens of thousands
of small transactions efficiently are what count, as Sherwin Williams has
proved in the US.
Companies like Akzo and ICI are used to transplanting marketing skills in
decorative paints around the world and are well up to this, apart from being
good enough chemists to match thousands of colours and guarantee their work,
whatever coatings technology was originally involved.
The debate symbolises the latest stage of evolution in paint markets. Even
15 years ago they were still largely national, with thousands of companies.
International spread was mostly based on the history of European
colonialism.
In the 1980s, ambitious suppliers of industrial coatings realised they had
to follow their customers as markets regionalised under political forces
like European union, or globalised under cost and efficiency pressures, as
in car manufacture or repainting ships.
Boats, trains, planes, cars and cans were all affected. A rush for territory
and presence began, led by BASF of Germany and ICI of Britain. Others, such
PPG of the US, which had developed the most corrosion-resistant
electro-coated system yet for car bodies, started buying their licensees
abroad.
If you could not dominate territory, you occupied specific product niches.
Courtaulds, which leads the world marine coatings market, set a trend by
occupying its niche on a global scale, followed by PPG in automotive OEM.
Theirs has proved the best policy because they did not suffer corporate
indigestion as they grew by acquisition. Moreover, their research was
focused on markets likely to yield early returns because they could
introduce new products or technology without a fight.
By contrast, ICI developed Aquabase, a good waterborne paint for automotive
OEM, but could not dislodge entrenched European competitors, even though
they were struggling to catch up with 'me-too' products. Du Pont, which has
a strong OEM and VR base in the US, will carry on alone.
Companies are refocusing on what they do best and where they can be in the
top three in a world or regional market. They have to: industrial buyers are
reducing numbers of suppliers - in the case of Ford, to one per factory.
So ICI has also sold its aerospace coatings business to Courtaulds, now a
leading transportation coatings specialist. In the US, Akzo sold its
aerospace business to Dexter, but took over the latter's coil coating
interests, while the two formed a joint venture in aerospace in Europe.
ICI's focus is now on its Dulux brand of decorative paints, VR, and can
coatings, where it is the US leader and strong in Europe against BASF.
Similarly, the Swedish-owned Beckers has strengthened in European coil
coatings, but sold its powder coatings business to Herberts : each was
separately strong in three or four countries but neither had enough volume;
Herberts is now strong in powder in eight European countries and will become
an increasingly important regional player.
By the same token, other companies abandoned low-margin decorative coatings,
where mass marketing is needed for sales volume and reasonable profits.
Hoechst set the trend here, selling Berger to Crown in the UK in the 1980s.
Similarly, Tikkurila of Finland sold Macpherson  - Woolworth's paintmaker -
to Akzo to concentrate on Kemira, its industrial coatings business.
If economies of scale offer the best prospects in these decorative markets,
big companies are best placed to achieve them. ICI is a strong marketeer of
premium brands to consumers and trade painters. Akzo absorbed a series of
medium-sized companies in the 1980s, then took over Casco Nobel, which - in
the UK - had already absorbed Crown, which had already absorbed Berger.
Other successful decorative paint companies like Johnstones passed into
French ownership, with Total now an international player. Petrofina, the
Belgian oil giant, is also in the big league through Sigma Coatings.
Independents can survive, but they have to be very good, such as Kalon,
which makes 'own-label' paints for DIY retailers. Its forte is good
logistics to ensure just-in-time distribution.
Small can still be beautiful, but your niche must be so unworthy of a
giant's attention, you will not be stamped on or swallowed. An example is
Carr's in Birmingham, or Weilburger, the UK subsidiary of the medium-sized
Grebe group of Germany.
The latter's strengths are in teltronics - matt-black, fingermark-proof
coatings for TV and video recorder cases - painting plastics and high
performance coatings for household durables.
And the role of the environment in all this? Not only does compliance with
green laws cost money, but also research and development time - and there is
little direct return.
Companies can only afford to spend resources on markets where they have
enough sales volume or margin to carry their 'dead' investment in the
environment. Every company's focus is likely to tighten further yet.
