   Clorox Co., citing strong markets and a lower tax rate, said earnings for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 rose 36% to a record for any quarter. 

   Net income was $39.4 million, or 73 cents a primary share, up 36% from $29 million, or 54 cents a share. 
On a fully diluted basis, per-share earnings were 71 cents in the latest period, compared with 54 cents. 
Per-share figures have been adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid in June. 

   Sales rose 10% to $302.5 million from $273.8 million. 
Clorox noted that year-ago sales contained revenue from operations that have since been sold. 
It said comparable sales were up 13% from last year. 

   Clorox is a grocery-products concern, which also makes paints, stains and products for the food-service industry. 

   C.R. Weaver, chairman and chief executive officer, said "virtually every part of our business contributed to the earnings improvement," with overseas shipments of grocery products reaching a record high. 

   A spokesman noted that the latest period's results reflect lower tax rates which went into effect July 1 as a result of the recent federal-tax overhaul. 
For the quarter just ended, Clorox's effective tax rate was 37.9% compared with 45.9% a year earlier. 

   While the company doesn't expect the latest period's earnings growth to continue through the rest of the fiscal year, it said it anticipates a "good year overall." 

   At the company's annual meeting yesterday, shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares to 175 million from 75 million.
