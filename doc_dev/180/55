   A Vincent van Gogh painting sold for $13.75
million, the fourth highest price paid at an auction, but the sale
disappointed a standing-room-only crowd after a string of record
prices for the artist's paintings.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux,'' which van Gogh finished shortly
before his suicide, sold at Christie's auction house Wednesday
night to an anonymous buyer who bid by telephone.
   Christie's had estimated van Gogh's 1890 portrait of his
innkeeper's 13-year-old daughter would bring $15 million, and the
reaction of the audience was subdued in contrast to the applause
that usually greets a record price.
   However, auctioneer Christopher Burge insisted afterward that
Christie's was not disappointed. ``It's a wonderful price for a
beautiful picture,'' he said.
   Daniel Varenne, an art dealer from Geneva, Switzerland, said he
was ``a little surprised'' that the painting fetched only $13.75
million. But he added the portrait was ``not an easy one to live
with'' and that may have affected the price.
   ``It's of a girl who's attractive but not that attractive. And
there's the possibility that the blue background is not that
appealing to a lot of people,'' he said.
   In the painting, Adeline, dressed in blue, sits in profile on a
chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon, her gaze is
serene, her posture correct and her hands are folded demurely in
front of her. The background is a deep, midnight blue.
   The painting is the latest in a string of paintings by van Gogh,
who had trouble selling his art during his lifetime, to fetch a
record price.
   ``Irises'' last year brought $53.9 million, the highest price
ever paid at auction for a painting. The second and third highest
prices bid at an auction were also for van Gogh paintings.
   The portrait was one of 70 lots offered for sale at an auction
of impressionist and modern art that fetched $63,173,000. Eleven
works of art did not find buyers despite a packed house.
   The second highest bid Wednesday was $6.6 million paid by an
anonymous private collector for Pierre Renoir's ``L'Ombrelle,'' a
painting of a woman in a garden holding a parasol and bouquet of
violets.
   Mary Cassatt's, ``The Conversation,'' a pastel on paper of two
women talking to each other, sold for $4.51 million, a record for
the artist. Burge called it ``a beautiful picture'' and ``an
extreme leap forward by the artist.'' It was bought by an anonymous
private collector.
   The fourth highest bid was $4.4 million paid by an anonymous
private collector for Maurice de Vlaminck's ``Le Pont de Chatou,''
an oil on canvas in brilliant colors of a bridge across the Seine
River in France.
   Alberto Giacometti's 1940s sculpture of three skinny, walking
men, ``Trois Hommes Qui Marchent,'' sold for $3.85 million to an
anonymous buyer, the most ever paid at auction for a 20th century
sculpture.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux'' was one of three van Gogh did of
his innkeeper's daughter. The most lifelike and detailed of the
trio is in a private collection in Switzerland. The other, which
shows only the girl's face, is owned by the Cleveland Museum of Art.
   The picture was made a month before van Gogh committed suicide
at age 37 in 1890 in the village of Auvers outside Paris. In a 1956
essay, Adeline Ravoux Carrie wrote that she didn't immediately
appreciate her portrait.
   ``It was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was
true to life,'' wrote Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at the age of
88.
   However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying,
``Monsieur Vincent divined not the young girl I was, but the woman
I was to become.''
