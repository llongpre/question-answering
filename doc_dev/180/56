   Competition, not aesthetics, is the issue behind a
state law defining ``schlock art,'' said an art dealer as cheap art
went on trial.
   ``The reason for this is the Rockport Art Association can't
compete with my prices,'' said United Oil Paintings Inc. President
Aaron Abady, who testified Tuesday in the non-jury trial before
Superior Court Judge John Cratsley.
   The Massachusetts law, which attorneys said is the first of its
kind in the nation, was passed in July at the urging of artists and
gallery owners in the seaside town of Rockport.
   It bans the sale of non-original art works unless they are
labeled ``not an original.'' Violators may be fined $100 per
painting.
   United Oil Paintings of Milford, which sells oil paintings for
$35 to $200, filed suit against the state in November, charging the
law is too vague and too broad and violates First Amendment rights
to free expression.
   Assistant Attorney General Douglas H. Wilkins argued that the
case was moot because United Oil has never been prosecuted, though
it has sold some 60,000 unlabeled paintings since the law was
passed. Wilkins argued that the law is intended to prevent deceptive
advertising and marketing and is constitutional.
   Abady said his company advertises ``Original oil paintings _
$89'' and has never had a consumer complaint filed.
   ``We're selling bedroom art,'' he said.
   One exhibit was a large box of oil paintings, including
landscapes, seascapes, still lifes, and two renditions of what
appeared to be the same lion in a small and a large size.
   ``These are original oil paintings, each one individually done,''
Abady told the judge as he displayed his wares.
   The testimony hinged on what exactly constitutes ``original''
art. Artists have complained that the ``schlock art'' is
mass-produced, often in an assembly-line type process, in the Far
East, and sold here as ``original.'' They claim some of the
mass-market offerings are copies of paintings by American artists,
living or dead.
   Abady testified that he has never seen mechanical reproduction of
paintings and does not believe such assembly lines exist.
   United Oil buys paintings from artists in the Far East, the
Dominican Republic and the United States and from art brokers in
bunches of 100 to 2,000 at a time but never without viewing each
individual painting first, he said. Each is signed by the artist, he
said.
   The paintings are sold in seaside art galleries and outlets from
Florida to Rockport and in shopping malls up and down the East
Coast, generating $5.5 million in sales last year, he said.
   Abady was scheduled to be cross-examined today. Attorneys said
the trial is expected to wrap up in three days.
