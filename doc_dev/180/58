   A painting by Jasper Johns sold for $17.1 million at Sotheby's last night, a staggering new record for a living artist. 

   The price broke a record set the night before at Christie's when a painting by Mr. Johns sold for $7 million. 
The painting was bought by New York art dealer Larry Gagosian as the crowd in the room gasped and applauded. 
Several dealers speculated that Mr. Gagosian bought the painting on behalf of publisher S.I. Newhouse, who sat next to him at the sale. 

   The record-breaking oil painting, made in 1959, is a vividly colored canvas with splotches of paint and the names of colors stenciled on the canvas. 

   The record was one of many in an evening in which 85 works sold for a total of $98.5 million, including a 10% buyer's commission. 
Nearly half the total was produced by 12 paintings from the collection of Victor and Sally Ganz. 
That total far exceeds the record for a contemporary art sale at Christie's Wednesday when $37.3 million of art was sold. 
It is also far above the highest total Sotheby's sold at a contemporary art sale, $26 million, set in May. 

   Other records included a price of $15.4 million for a work by Pablo Picasso. 
The previous record for a Picasso was $7.6 million. 
Numerous other records were set for such artists as Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, George Segal and Frank Stella. 

   Sotheby's is a unit of London-based Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
