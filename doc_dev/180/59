   A string of price records for contemporary
artists, including Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol, fell in
frenzied bidding at Sotheby's that fetched nearly $26 million, the
auction house said.
   ``I've never seen the bidding as heated as it was this
evening,'' Lucy Mitchell-Innes, head of Sotheby's contemporary art
department said after Monday night's sale.
   The highest price bid was the $4.84 million an anonymous
Japanese dealer paid for Pollock's ``The Search,'' believed to be
his last canvas, Ms. Mitchell-Innes said.
   It was a record for a work of contemporary art, as well as a
record for the artist, she said.
   The auction of works put up for sale by various owners as well
as from Warhol's personal collection brought in $25,954,500, a
record for an auction of contemporary art, according to Sotheby's.
Of 74 lots offered, 65 were sold.
   Record prices were set for works by 12 artists, including
Pollock, Warhol, Franz Kline, Cy Twombly, David Hockney, Willem de
Kooning and Richard Diebenkorn. Six paintings sold for more than $1
million, she said.
   ``The contemporary (art) world is now extremely aware of the
rarity of these really important paintings,'' Ms. Mitchell-Innes
said. ``People are very sensitive to the fact that these paintings
won't come up again. People kow this is their last shot.''
   Pollock's ``Search,'' a canvas in tones of green, red, yellow,
black and white, had a presale estimate of $3 million to $4
million. The painting is from the Palm Beach residence of art
collector Belle Linsky.
   The previous record for a work of contemporary art sold at
auction was the $3.63 million Jasper John's ``Out the Window''
brought in 1986 and the same amount for de Kooning's ``Pink Lady''
last May. Both paintings were sold at Sotheby's.
   The second highest bid Monday night was the $1.87 million a U.S.
dealer paid for Kline's ``Ninth Street,'' a black and white
abstract, Sotheby's said. Its presale estimate was $700,000 to
$900,000.
   The previous record for an auction of contemporary art was $18.9
million last May, according to Sotheby's.
