   Clorox Co., Oakland, Calif., posted a $21.9 million loss from its discontinued paint unit, forcing a nearly 50% plunge in its fourth-quarter net income to $18.8 million, or 34 cents a share, from $36.6 million, or 67 cents a share, a year ago. 

   The household products company posted an 11% increase in operating profit to $40.8 million, or 74 cents a share, for the quarter ended June 30. 
The write-downs stem from the planned sale of its Olympic stain and Lucite paint business. 

   For the year, Clorox posted a 10% gain in operating profit to $145.6 million, or $2.63 a share, from $130.9 million, or $2.39 a share, in fiscal 1988. 
A $21.4 million loss from the discontinued operations made net $124.1 million, or $2.24 a share. 

   For the previous year, a $1.6 million gain from discontinued operations made net $132.6 million, or $2.42 a share. 

   Results for the year-ago periods were restated to reflect both the discontinued paint operations, as well as the conversion of a note payable to Henkel Corp.
