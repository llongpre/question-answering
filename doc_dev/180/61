<TEXT>
<P>
The century's last decade has just begun. A nation long regarded as a world 
superpower seems at the apogee of greatness, flaunting its wealth and prestige 
like a bedizened courtesan. 
</P>
<P>
A strata of self-doubt lurks just beneath its rhinestone encrusted surface. A 
humiliating defeat in a war with a third-rate power still rankles and 
everywhere there are fissures in the frosting -- government is wracked with 
scandal, drug and alcohol use escalate alarmingly, conservative forces harden 
position while radicals plant bombs or drift into mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
A country proud of its cultural modernity hoists one more glass of bubbly while 
glancing covertly at two threatening peoples -- the Germans and the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar as it all sounds, the scenario is not about the United States in the 
1990s. It is about France in the 1890s -- the Franco-Prussian war, not Vietnam; 
the Dreyfus affair, not Iran-contra; La Belle Epoch, not "The Bonfire of the 
Vanities." It is particularly about a historic exhibition opening to the public 
Wednesday at the Museum of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"Monet in the '90s" is a singular art event reuniting the largest number of the 
artist's renowned "series" paintings to be assembled since they were executed 
</P>
<P>
and dispersed a century ago -- 90 of them, just so we don't lose the theme. 
These nuanced variations on such landscape motifs as poplar trees, grain stacks 
and the facade of Rouen Cathedral have multiple happy properties. 
Postcard-popular with the general public, they are also awesome icons for 
cognoscenti who regard them as seedbeds of modern art and the source of 
contemporary serial painting, which involved everybody from Andy Warhol to 
Frank Stella. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the museum has a blockbuster that even the fussiest connoisseur 
cannot disdain. It will surely pull big crowds until it closes here April 29. 
It then travels to Chicago's Art Institute and London's Royal Academy, which 
co-organized the event. No, it won't go to Los Angeles, and more's the pity. 
</P>
<P>
C'est dommage, because it is not only a superb, revealing show but because the 
title is a significant pun. "Monet in the '90s" means what is says but it also 
means the way the 1990s look at Monet. 
</P>
<P>
By now, alert readers may be asking themselves about the connection between 
Monet -- the quintessential art-for-art's-sake Impressionist -- and social 
upheavals in France at the fin de siecle. Didn't the artist known as 
just-an-eye-but-what-an-eye simply do his dappled thing while Paris wallowed in 
enticing decadence? 
</P>
<P>
Well, not according to the compelling catalogue written by the show's 
organizer, Paul Hayes Tucker of the University of Massachusetts, Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker -- a Monet specialist -- thinks in a radical revisionist art historical 
manner much abroad in academia. The method goes beyond traditional questions of 
style, school and individual artistic psychology to link art and artists to 
larger social, political and economic issues. It tends to demythologize 
comfortable, romantic notions about the artistic character. Tucker paints a 
portrait of Monet as a shrewd, self-promoting entrepreneur with a sharp eye on 
the competition, the market and public taste. 
</P>
<P>
The artist was pushing 50 -- and working in an Impressionist manner that even 
his contemporary, Pissarro, called "rancid" -- when he did his first series 
paintings. According to Tucker, different suites intended to counter the 
competition of the radical young Seurat prove the old dog could still absorb 
the new tricks of decorative Symbolism, soothe the rattled nationalism of his 
audience with reassuring traditional rural themes and -- finally -- express 
utter disgust with the rapacious anti-Semitism of the Dreyfus case. After that, 
Monet retired to his garden at Giverny. There he painted the "Japanese 
Footbridge" series, presumably as an encouragement to emulate Oriental 
reverence for nature and private meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Whew! To believe all that is to believe artists are capable of conducting their 
careers as a kind of three-dimensional chess game. 
</P>
<P>
But Tucker's text, although often highly circumstantial, frequently rings true. 
During this period, Monet made the final transition from scruffy bohemian to an 
artist of immense wealth and the stature of a national hero. Critical response 
to his exhibitions was so ecstatic that newspapers like Le Gaulois devoted 
whole supplements to his art. He must have been doing something right, even if 
much of this putative French nationalist art sold to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, we know artists like this. In California alone, people like Robert 
Irwin or Robert Graham are almost as admired for their career tactics as for 
their work. With Monet, as with them, it remains an open question whether their 
amazing astuteness arises from intuition or calculation. Whichever, Monet is 
characterized very much in the mold of the artist going into 1990s -- the canny 
pro rather than the visionary seer. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain. When we come to actually look at the Monets, tactical and 
sociological questions give way to issues that are universal and poetic. 
</P>
<P>
These are still the paintings that make us hear Debussy in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker has simply proven again that you can slice art many ways without 
wounding it. 
</P>
<P>
The first suite on view is a group of eight canvases done in the Creuse Valley 
in 1889. Each depicts a mounded landscape cradling a section of river under 
changing light. "Sunlight Effect" approaches the rugged naturalism of Courbet, 
"Evening Effect" muffles tone and shape so closely as to point to abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
Curious. We are so accustomed to associating Monet with the dappled delicacy of 
stereotypical Impressionism that it is a surprise to feel this work burly and 
somewhat inert under its surface texture. 
</P>
<P>
The effect goes away in half a dozen graceful views of fields at Giverny but 
returns in 15 pictures from the famous "Grain Stack" suite, with its humble 
conical piles enduring the heat and snow of the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
(The French like to complain, "En ete on crame, et on hiver on caille" -- "In 
summer we boil and in winter we freeze.") 
</P>
<P>
If we want to have unaccustomed thoughts about Monet based on the pictures, it 
is their revelation of a quality not unlike Expressionist anguish. Fairly 
subtle most of the time, it is most obvious in mountain paintings he did on a 
visit to Norway. We suddenly find him predicting the neurotic tensions of an 
Edvard Munch. 
</P>
<P>
There is something phantasmagoric about the grain stacks -- they look scruffy 
and defensive, like dwarf Abominable Snowmen ready to mount a crazy attack on 
anybody who disturbs their elemental hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
Monet worried and complained about his art so consistently that his wife once 
said that being disgruntled was part of his nature. When he was painting the 
now-revered Rouen Cathedral suite, he had nightmares about the building. "It 
fell on me," he wrote, "and seemed to be pink or blue or yellow." 
</P>
<P>
So much for the serene patriarch of Giverny. This sounds more like the 
visionary disturbance of a Van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
The "Cathedrals" series -- seen here in 10 versions -- creates an odd, even 
upsetting tension between the stout solidity of the building and Monet's 
liquefying light. His struggle with them shows. They exist somewhere between 
noble failure and narrow triumph. 
</P>
<P>
One is left convinced that Monet made his art in a state of struggle against 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
But only half the time. 
</P>
<P>
The artist was grumpy and obsessive. He could turn the latter quality to good 
use in the real world, as when he mounted a successful subscription campaign to 
have Manet's "Olympia" given to the nation, or fought tenaciously to build his 
Giverny water garden or save the poplar trees on his property line. He was 
bear-like and formidable. 
</P>
<P>
But his favorite painting was Watteau's exquisite "Embarcation for Cythera." 
His favored colors were green and lavender -- said to be the hues of the pure 
aesthete. 
</P>
<P>
The suites of series paintings virtually alternate between moody downers like 
the grain stacks and lyric celebrations like the "Poplars." The trees stand 
like serpentine rows of slender girls in pale green dresses, billowing hair 
united by mischievous winds. 
</P>
<P>
If we want to fool around with fashionable theories about what makes artists 
tick, we could do worse than to explain Monet as a manic-depressive. Like most 
analysis, that's too gross but it sets some useful parameters. 
</P>
<P>
Monet was really a blender and rectifier -- a very French seeker of harmonic 
compromise, a very individual pioneer of new frontiers carefully gained. 
</P>
<P>
The most useful metaphor for Monet is the idea of the cinematic lap-dissolve. 
His work demands that the viewer make subtle distinctions. We find ourselves 
wishing they could all be projected on one spot to more clearly show his 
caressing light, lengthening shadows and changing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
With Monet, everything dissolves into everything else. Illumination on a 
hillside changes furrowed earth into choppy water. The act of depicting the 
land dissolves into pure painting. His melancholy dissolves into his joy to 
produce the poignant "Mornings on the Seine." Talk about harmony. No wonder he 
liked Whistler. 
</P>
<P>
The final suite on view is the lovely "Japanese Footbridge" set. Poor 
installation does not diminish either its sense of fulfillment or its symbolic 
message. In most versions, the bridge leads out of the canvas to new 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
One wanders backwards through the exhibition to be struck by the overriding 
common property of the paintings. Almost without exception, they want to be 
bigger. They strain uncomfortably at their frames like Samson in the Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Monet died in 1926 at age 87. He still had more than a quarter-century to paint 
in his garden after the footbridge suite. The result was the magnificent, huge, 
waterlily paintings that burst his final limitation, size. Of course he grumped 
the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
Monet's work does send a message to the 1990s. When the world lets you down, 
cultivate the inner garden and let no man trample its fruits.
