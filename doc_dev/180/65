In a 1989 show at New York's Charles Cowles Gallery, Sabina Ott began her 
series of encaustic (wax) paintings on the theme "Disappearance and Return" 
with a body of works examining narcissism and the absence of self. Now, 
returning to her hometown of Los Angeles with a show of the same title at Santa 
Monica's Pence Gallery, Ott fills that absence by using the metaphor of the 
rose as "the synthesis between the spiritual and material worlds." 
</P>
<P>
In her paintings, Ott says, the rose acts as a metaphor for the human body. But 
unlike the traditional image, Ott's layered roses are not always beautiful. One 
work, for instance, features blue roses on a flesh-toned background to 
represent bruises on skin. 
</P>
<P>
"Each painting focuses on using the rose as a different aspect of the body," 
says Ott, 35, who has been working with wax since 1987. Conceptual art, she 
says, has had a heavy influence on her work. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of art is about ideas; I set up a conceptual skeleton and then use the 
paint and materials to flesh it out. Through these paintings I set up a 
vocabulary, almost like a code with an alphabet -- I want the work to pose that 
question of 'How do these works relate to each other?' It's very much about 
multiple readings, and one painting really should not be taken on its own 
without looking at the rest of the work." 
</P>
<P>
As an example of how her pieces interrelate, Ott pointed out a four-panel work 
in which each of the small scenes depicted shows up later in a larger work. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece operates as a kind of legend or map . . . giving you the beginnings 
of the alphabet" for the rest of the works, says Ott, an active member of the 
L.A. Coalition for Freedom of Expression who was featured this summer in a 
two-person show at Washington's Corcoran Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
As for the wax, Ott says she likes the "mutability" of the medium and the fact 
that it "complicates" her work. 
</P>
<P>
"I started with strictly paint, but gradually I outgrew that way of looking at 
things. I needed a new and more complex way of setting up questions in the 
work," she says. 
</P>

THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of work, Kent Twitchell has completed his 
4,000-square-foot L.A. Marathon Mural along the wall of the northbound San 
Diego Freeway, between Century and Manchester boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The mural depicts 26 runners, ranging from four-time Olympian Rod Dixon of New 
Zealand to novice runner John Dolan of Sierra Madre. It "extracts the essence 
of the marathon" by picking out a handful of runners from the "sea of 
thousands," Twitchell says. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for Twitchell's second L.A. Marathon Mural, which will take up 7,700 
square feet along the westbound Santa Monica Freeway between National and 
Overland boulevards, are already in progress. 
</P>

More than $1 million has been raised to date for Harvey Gantt's North Carolina

Avenue's Gemini G.E.L.

copies of the new directory will be available in early 1991.

OVERHEARD 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did all these young, new artists come from? I can remember when Jill 
Geigerich was the only 'new' artist who got any attention. Now it seems half 
the galleries are filled with 'new' artists." -- A middle-aged man, during a 
Saturday afternoon trek around Santa Monica galleries.

CURRENTS 
</P>
<P>
The Art Dealers Assn. of America and its member galleries have raised $51,150 
for the legal defense fund of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, and 
the association is urging other arts groups to mount their own fund-raising 
campaigns for the center. 
</P>
<P>
The center and its director, Dennis Barrie, were acquitted on obscenity charges 
connected with the center's showing of "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect 
Moment," but accrued more than $300,000 in legal defense fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We have won the battle and reaffirmed our First Amendment rights, but the 
drain on our finances jeopardizes the future of the arts center," said director 
Barrie, who noted that the ADDA's gift and challenge to other groups would help 
ensure the future of the center.
