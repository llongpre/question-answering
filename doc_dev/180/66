   A Japanese gallery bought Vincent van Gogh's
``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' for $82.5 million Tuesday, a record
auction price for any art work and double the price estimated by
Christie's, a spokeswoman for the auction house said.
   ``This is by far the world's most expensive painting,''
surpassing the $53.9 million price bid for Van Gogh's ``Irises'' in
November 1987 at Sotheby's auction house, Christie's spokeswoman
Susan Britman said.
   The buyer, a representative for the Kobayashi Gallery in Tokyo,
was in the room during the approximately 10 minutes of bidding that
opened at $20 million, Britman said. Toward the end of bidding,
only the Kobayshi representative and a telephone bidder whose
identity wasn't disclosed were vying for the painting, she said.
   ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' an image of the physician who tended
Van Gogh during the last weeks before his suicide, was painted 100
years ago.
   It had been expected to fetch between $40 million and $50
million at a sale of major works by impressionist and modern
artists.
   The auction has been anticipated as a key test of the strength
of the art market. Prices boomed in the mid- to late 1980s but the
1987 stock market crash and unusual circumstances surrounding the
sale of ``Irises'' had cast doubt on whether prices would continue
to rise.
   Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond bought ``Irises'' largely with
money borrowed from Sotheby's, the house that handled the auction.
Bond's business empire became swamped in debt after the stock
market crash, and he was forced to sell the painting for an
undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty Museum in March.
   ``Dr. Gachet'' was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
1984. It is from the collection of Siegfried Kramarsky, a
German-born New York banker who died in 1961. It was put on the
block by a trust created under his will.
   The portrait of Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet was painted six weeks
before van Gogh committed suicide in 1890.
   In a letter to artist Paul Gauguin, van Gogh wrote that he had
painted Gachet ``with the heart-broken expression of our time'' and
that it was ``not destined to be understood.''
   Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was van Gogh's
friend and physician. He was also close to other impressionist
painters of the time.
   In the painting, Gachet is shown seated at a table, head in hand.
   Van Gogh painted a second, slightly larger version of the
portrait, which hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It lacks the
details of the Kramarsky painting and its colors are flatter.
   Another van Gogh from the Kramarsky collection was auctioned in
1987 for $20.24 million. It too had been lent to the Metropolitan.
