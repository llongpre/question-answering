   NEW YORK -- At Christie's International PLC last night,
Frida Kahlo's "Self-Portrait With Loose Hair," sold for $1.65
million, setting a record for a painting by a Latin American
artist.
   Amid softening demand for Impressionist, modern and
contemporary artworks, art auction houses and dealers have
attempted to jump-start other segments of the art market, and
Christie's has been particularly promoting its sales efforts
in Latin American art.

   The Kahlo had been expected to sell for $1.5 million to $2
million. The final price included a 10% commission to
Christie's.
   Overall, at Christie's sale of Latin American art, 24 of
the 61 art works didn't sell.
   Louise Noun, the owner of the Kahlo, reached at her home
in Des Moines, Iowa, said she was "delighted." She bought the
painting in 1983 for $85,000 from art dealer Mary-Anne
Martin. Proceeds go to the University of Iowa.
   Ms. Noun had earlier arranged to sell the painting
privately through Sotheby's Holdings Inc., Christie's chief
business rival. She said she changed her mind when Sotheby's
canceled its Latin American paintings sale.
   The previous record for a Latin American art work was set
at Sotheby's. In May 1990, Ms. Martin, the Latin American
paintings dealer, paid $1.43 million for another Kahlo.
