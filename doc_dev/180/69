   Michelangelo would have run afoul of Massachusetts
law if he tried to sell his painting of the Sistine Chapel as an
original, an attorney challenging the state's new ``schlock art''
law claimed Monday.
   ``The statute as it is written defines `original' as requiring
only one person to work on it, and Michelangelo had apprentices that
helped him out,'' said attorney Alvin Nathanson.
   Nathanson represents United Oil Paintings Inc., which sells oil
paintings for $35 to $200 in seaside art galleries and shopping
malls up and down the Eastern seaboard. The company sued
Massachusetts saying the state law _ the first of its sort in the
nation _ is vague and unconstitutional.
   The law bans the sale of ``non-original art'' unless it is
labeled ``not an original.'' It defines original as ``independently
created and executed and signed by the individual artist'' _ a
standard Nathanson insists many Old Masters could not meet.
   After a three-day trial last week, both sides are now waiting for
Suffolk Superior Court Judge John Cratsley to decide what separates
original art from schlock. Cratsley is not expected to rule until
next month at the earliest.
   The state legislator who wrote the law said he only intended to
keep consumers from being sold cheap copies under the guise of
``original'' art.
   State Sen. Robert Buell said ``schlock art'' companies put names
similar to those of famous artists on paintings that are very
similar to the well-known works. While such paintings stop short of
forgery, Buell said, they are certainly not original.
   ``There's nothing wrong with selling it,'' said Buell, who
sponsored the law on behalf of artists in the seaside resort of
Rockport. ``It's just deceitful to tell the customer who's paying
$45 or $65 that he's getting an original painting.''
   United Oil, in a broad attack on the law, has asked the court not
only to define original but also to explain how police officers
charged with enforcing the law could be expected to make such
distinctions.
   Douglas H. Wilkins, the assistant attorney general defending the
state, has argued that the point is moot since United Oil has never
been prosecuted, though it has sold more than 60,000 paintings since
the law was passed.
   Wilkins also has argued that the law is constitutional because it
protects consumers against deceptive marketing.
   He told the judge it could be used to prosecute those who copy
others' work, make machine reproductions and sell them as original
oil paintings or sign false names to paintings.
   Wilkins dismissed the Michelangelo example, saying any law could
be challenged in the abstract using far-fetched examples.
   ``How are they going to sell the Sistine Chapel, anyway?'' he
said. ``Is it like selling the Brooklyn Bridge?''
