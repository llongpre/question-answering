   Clorox Co., Oakland, Calif., said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as five million shares, or 9%, of its common outstanding. 

   The maker of bleach and other consumer products said the shares will be repurchased through periodic open-market and block transactions. 
Clorox had 55.4 million shares outstanding as of June 30. 

   C.R. Weaver, chairman and chief executive officer, said Clorox expects to have higher cash reserves after its planned sale of its Olympia HomeCare Products Co. unit and that "the repurchase of shares is an appropriate use" of some of those funds. 
He said the repurchased shares will be held in the company's treasury for future corporate purposes such as stock options, among other possibilities. 

   A spokesman said Clorox is negotiating with a potential buyer for the Olympia unit, which primarily makes paint and wood stains. 
He said Clorox believes it is "very close to a deal."
