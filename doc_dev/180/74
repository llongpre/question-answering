and Olympia fairs

This is it: the month that will decide for many of the nation's 8,000
professional antique dealers if the long-awaited, and oft-predicted, revival
in demand is actually there - or whether they will have to struggle on,
persuading their bank managers they are worth supporting for another year.
In June, London once again becomes - although briefly - the centre of the
international art market. Rich collectors and dealers arrive for the grand
Grosvenor House Fair which, for 10 days from Thursday, celebrates its 60th
anniversary.
They take in, too, the important exhibitions staged simultaneously by the
top West End galleries, plus the major auctions. And they will surely pop
along as well to Olympia where, for the next nine days, more than 400
dealers, mainly British but with an increasing number of foreign exhibitors,
display the largest accumulation of vetted antiques seen annually in London.
Around 40,000 people are expected at Olympia, a popular bun-fight where the
largest London dealer in Old Masters, Richard Green, lines up alongside
provincial furniture dealers on their annual selling trip to London. Some
will expect to notch up 40 per cent of their annual turnover there from the
choice items they have salted away for the occasion.
Opening day on Thursday got off to a starry start - Elton John, Andrew Lloyd
Webber and Rowan Atkinson were all touting their cheque books. Of course
Olympia is too large - although Imagebase, a visual database which locates
the stands offering the antiques in which you might have particular
interest, should ease aching feet. Dealers love Olympia. One reason is that,
at around Pounds 15,000 a stand, it is half the price of Grosvenor House.
But it really does have an aura of excitement despite the chaos.
In good years, Grosvenor House dealers used to raid Olympia each day for
fresh stock. It could just happen again in 1994, for there is a feeling that
the revival in business must come soon. To help with transport, there is a
bus service between the two fairs.
Grosvenor House has a very different atmosphere. The organisers have
digested the fact that its glitzy array, and sometimes exorbitant prices,
have deterred both middle range collectors and informed browsers. They know
also that the more international Maastricht fair in March has had the edge
in recent years. So, for its diamond jubilee, Grosvenor House has been given
a new look
The biggest change is quite revolutionary: it has abolished datelines. For
the first time, the great works of art of the 20th century - Picasso
paintings, Matisse prints, art deco ceramics, abstract expressionism even -
can now be displayed. Indeed, it is possible that the Dover Street Gallery
will offer a painting by the still-shocking Allen Jones, creator of sexist
furniture.
There will certainly be 1920s' furniture on the Yves Mikaeloff stand; a
1930s' bronze at Agnews (along with a fresh-on-the-market Lawrence
portrait); an Ivon Hitchen at Spink; Matisse lithographs at William Weston;
and designs by Omar Ramsden and CR Ashbee at Nicholas Harris.
It will take time for the change in stock to filter through: despite the
arrival of a few foreign dealers, Grosvenor House remains the annual
showcase for the cream of the British antiques trade and, especially, brown
furniture dealers. But, over the next few years, younger and trendier
collectors of the modern will have reason to add this fair to their
itinerary.
A more immediate impact comes from a transformation in the fair's
appearance. Designer George Carter has created a classical environment, with
colonnades of Tuscan pilasters creating a unified look. The height of the
stands has been raised considerably so that more substantial antiques, like
chandeliers and tapestries, can be displayed attractively.
Dealers also are attempting to offer a wider range of stock. There will be
fewer seven-figure masterpieces and more four-figure collectables. Among the
affordable items are early English needlework at Witney Antiques; a Danish
wine barrel at Jeremy Ltd; St Louis goblets at Mallett; and a pair of
Regency painted children's chairs at Halcyon Days.
In total contrast is Newark, in Nottinghamshire, the biggest antique and
collectors' fair in the world with up to 4,000 stalls stretching over 86
acres. It opens on Tuesday; and, although it might be only one step ahead of
a superior boot sale, there is enough good furniture on display for it to be
a magnet for continental dealers.
Yes, there are too many fairs. But with dealers being forced by higher costs
and lower revenues to close down their retail premises - Lapada, the
Association of Art and Antique Dealers, reckons that up to 10 per cent of
its members have shut up shop in the past two years - fairs, both specialist
and general, have become a lifeline for dealers now trading from home. At
fairs, they can acquire new stock, meet existing and new customers - and
perhaps sell some antiques.
As well as the big mixed fairs, this month also sees two successful
specialist gatherings in London: the Antiquarian Book Fair, at Grosvenor
House for the first time, from June 30; and the International Ceramics Fair,
at the Park Lane Hotel from June 10.
While there has been a slight improvement in demand in the antiques trade
over the past year, the recovery remains as elusive as that in house prices
and the economy generally. If overall confidence improves, so will antique
buying.
Dealers hope there is considerable pent-up demand; certainly, there is a
shortage of good items appearing on the market. The travails at Lloyd's have
released relatively few art works to date although, sadly, they have
eliminated one major source of buyers.
Salerooms are showing dealers the way by looking overseas for new business.
Of course, with vastly greater financial resources, it is easier for them to
do so. This year, both Christie's South Kensington and Bonhams - which
concentrate on the middle and lower ranges of the market - report an
increase in turnover of more than 20 per cent.
This comes partly from their success in marketing themselves to foreign
buyers - in Bonhams' case, by forming a marketing relationship with auction
houses in New York, Los Angeles and Vienna.
Demand also has been stimulated by the salerooms trading in new markets.
Christie's South Kensington has had great success with cameras  - and
corkscrews. Bonhams is offering Victorian Gothic on June 20 to coincide with
the big Pugin show at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum this month.
In areas such as furniture and, to a lesser extent, pictures, there is no
doubt that buyers now have the confidence to bid at auction rather than rely
on the advice of dealers. This is a long-term problem for the trade, which
fairs go only some way to countering. But stories about the demise of London
as an international art centre seem premature. Leslie Waddington, one
leading modern art dealer, might be threatening to close one of his
galleries in Cork Street, London - but that would leave him with a couple of
brace still trading happily.
Indeed, three important international dealers have just shown their faith in
the future by opening up in London for the first time. Finarte, from Italy,
is mounting a major show of the work of the surrealist artist de Chirico in
new premises in Mason's Yard; Johnnie Eskenazi, cousin of Giuseppe, is
settling in Old Bond Street to trade in rugs, textiles and Oriental art; and
Danny Katz gives London its first major specialist sculpture gallery, in the
old Heim premises in Jermyn Street.
