A painting of a stag, roaring his defiance atop a Highland crag, sold for
Pounds 793,500 at Christie's yesterday. It was painted, of course, by
Landseer and wowed the Summer Show at the Royal Academy in 1857. It is
reckoned to be only exceeded in majesty by his 'Monarch of the Glen',
painted six years earlier. The price was lower than expected but it was a
record for Landseer and demand for such very British pictures is basically
confined to the UK.
With only a small leap of the imagination Landseer's stag can represent the
art market seeing off the recession. For things have undoubtedly improved
over the last few weeks. Pictures are luxuries rather than antique
essentials, like tables and chairs. They suffered most during the art market
slump of the last four years. Now the dam of frustrated demand has broken.
In the sale of Victorian pictures an early historical work by Alma-Tadema,
showing the children of Clovis being educated in murder, sold for Pounds
133,500, and a portrait of Lord Tennyson by Watts, which had previously
failed to sell, made Pounds 45,500. This was a good example of the auction
houses persuading sellers to lower reserves, and then placing cautious
estimates on the pictures to tempt back buyers. In November 1992 the Watts
was estimated at Pounds 60,00-Pounds 80,000; yesterday it was marked down to
a realistic Pounds 40,000-Pounds 60,000.
The great breakthrough sale was on March 11 when Christie's sold 93 per cent
by value of its auction of modern British paintings, a sector which had been
badly battered in the early 1990s. A painting by Harold Gilman, a leading
member of the Camden Town School, of his landlady in her bleak room, soared
to a record Pounds 111,500, as against its recessionary Pounds 30,000 top
estimate, while the ever popular wildlife artist David Sheppard hit a new
high of Pounds 40,000 for 'Buffalo Disturbed', as against a Pounds 10,000
top estimate. Throw in a Munnings 'Field of Poppies' for Pounds 128,000
(compared with the Pounds 25,000 forecast) and you have an auction which was
the best for years. According to specialist Jonathan Horwich 'prices are now
back to 1989 levels', the peak of the market before the fall.
This week Sotheby's sold almost 79 per cent by value of its second division
Impressionists, with Picasso pots in demand; 73 per cent of its modern
British; and almost 90 per cent of its contemporary art, always a tricky
area.
Things seem set to continue to improve. Sotheby's is offering four major
paintings in its key sale on June 28, paintings which sellers would not
willingly have put on the market in recent years. All have been locked away
in collections for generations and should greatly appeal to museums and
discriminating collectors. The day of the flashy painting is temporarily
over.
The most art historically interesting is Manet's only completed oil sketch
for his masterpiece 'Bar at the Folies Bergere', in the Courtauld.
Underneath that most famous of Impressionist paintings, is this composition,
the original version. The Pounds 3m estimate seems modest. Also on offer is
a Monet painting from his poplar series, also expected to make Pounds 3m,
and a portrait by Frederic Bazille, whose promising career was cut short in
the Franco-Prussian War when he was 29. Finally a Picasso pastel of 1901, as
pretty a portrait of a woman as you could wish for, is enticingly estimated
at Pounds 600,000-Pounds 800,000.
