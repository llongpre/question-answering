<HEAD>Museum Announces Acquisition of Van Gogh's `Irises'</HEAD>

   The J. Paul Getty Museum announced today
it has purchased its greatest 19th century painting, the
masterpiece ``Irises'' by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, for an
undisclosed sum.
   Painted in 1889, ``Irises'' was sold to the museum by Alan Bond,
the financially troubled Australian entrepreneur who paid a record
$53.9 million for the work at a 1987 auction.
   In keeping with its policy of not discussing details of private
acquisitions, the museum will not be disclosing the price of the
work, the Getty said in a statement.
   The painting already is on display in the museum's second-floor
galleries, where other 19th century paintings are displayed,
including works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edouard Manet and Edvard
Munch.
   ``The chance to acquire the painting was a great moment in the
history of the museum and the trust,'' said Harold M. Williams,
president and chief executive officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust.
   Getty, the late oil baron endowed the museum with $2.1 billion,
making it the world's richest art institution.
   The painting, characteristic of van Gogh's bold style,
represents a patch of garden in a French asylum at Saint-Remy de
Provence, where the troubled artist committed himself following a
mental breakdown in Arles.
   ``This is among the most original and dynamic of all van Gogh's
compositions, in which the spearlike, slashing representation of
the flowers is echoed by the vibrancy of color,'' said George
Goldner, the Getty's curator of paintings and drawings. ``At the
same time it is a picture of great poetry, as expressed in the one
white iris on the left side which, in its isolation, has a special
poignancy.''
   The private transaction was arranged by Sotheby's New York
auction house, which had loaned Bond $27 million to buy ``Irises,''
using the painting itself as collateral.
   The unusual deal was widely criticized for inflating prices in
the international art market.
   Since Bond's financial empire began crumbling under the weight
of more than $5 billion in debt, there has been considerable
curiosity about the fate of ``Irises'' among art curators, dealers
and collectors.
   In a statement released by Sotheby's, Bond was quoted as saying,
``I am very pleased with this sale, particularly because this great
masterpiece will be on exhibition at such a pre-eminent museum.''
