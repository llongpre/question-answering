Chinese police have raided an exhibition of nude paintings influenced by 
Tibetan Buddhism and shown to a shocked Beijing public, artists said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A security van with flashing lights rushed to the Beijing Artists Gallery on 
Saturday evening. Uniformed policemen confiscated six paintings and questioned 
artist Cao Yong, a witness said. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit had been open for 5 days and was being packed up when police 
arrived. The raid followed the closing of several nude photographic exhibitions 
in the eastern city of Nanking recently. 
</P>
<P>
Artists said the authorities wanted to put the brakes on a new wave of artistic 
freedom that is taking China by storm. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, officials from the legal department of Beijing's cultural 
office visited Cao's exhibition to tell him that members of the public had 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
One painting shows a heap of naked women below Buddhist-monklike figures and 
another depicts a woman dragging two men by their genitalia out of a fire. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Cao, 26, an ethnic Han Chinese -- had spent a lot of time in Tibet 
and was sympathetic to the Himalayan region's culture and religion. 
</P>
<P>
"The authorities are still not sure of the dividing line between art and 
pornography in China," said one avant-garde artist. 
</P>
<P>
Artists won a major cultural battle last month, opening a controversial 
exhibition of nude paintings in Beijing's national art gallery. Huge crowds 
flocked to see it. 
</P>
<P>
The show was followed this month by a major exhibition of avant-garde art that 
was closed temporarily after the artists angered the authorities with 
performances of "action art."
