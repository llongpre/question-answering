   The J. Paul Getty Museum said Wednesday it
has bought Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises'' from a debt-plagued
entrepreneur who had bid a record $53.9 million for the masterpiece
in 1987.
   ``The chance to acquire the painting was a great moment in the
history of the museum and the trust,'' said Harold M. Williams,
president and chief executive officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust.
   ``Irises'' already is on display in the museum's second-floor
galleries alongside other 19th-century paintings by Pierre-Auguste
Renoir, Edouard Manet and Edvard Munch.
   Painted in 1889 in van Gogh's bold style, it depicts a patch of
garden in a French asylum at Saint-Remy de Provence, where the
Dutch artist committed himself after a mental breakdown in Arles.
   Purple and midnight-blue blooms dominate, offset by a single
white iris to the left and balanced below by salmon-pink soil.
   The painting was sold privately to the museum by Australian
entrepreneur Alan Bond, who is reported to be $5 billion in debt.
He bought it at a Sotheby's auction in New York on Nov. 11, 1987.
   In keeping with its policy of not discussing details of private
acquisitions, the museum declined to disclose the price.
   The museum also did not discuss security arrangements. Early
Sunday, thieves in Boston stole 12 artworks from the Gardner
Museum. The loss was estimated in the hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   John Paul Getty, the late oil baron, endowed the museum with
$2.1 billion, making it the world's richest art institution.
   ``Until the sale of 1987, the painting was a well-known work.
But it didn't achieve anything like the fame it achieved when it
was sold here,'' said David Nash, Sotheby's director of fine arts
in New York.
   The latest sale was arranged by Sotheby's, which had loaned Bond
$27 million to buy ``Irises'' in an unusual deal that was widely
criticized for inflating prices in the international art market.
   Bond's subsequent financial trouble further fueled intense
speculation among art curators, dealers and collectors about the
fate of the painting.
   While acknowledging the controversy, Diana D. Brooks, president
of Sotheby's North America, said, ``We're comfortable with the way
we handled it, and we're delighted that it's going to such a
prestigous institution.''
   She declined to describe any of the behind-the-scenes
negotiations involving the painting. But when asked if Sotheby's
had steered ``Irises'' to the Getty, Brooks said, ``If you had
asked us of our dream, we would have said we would've wanted it to
go to the Getty Museum.''
   Nash, of Sotheby's, said ``the thing that's remarkable about the
painting is its intensity and the energy that it conveys.''
   ``This is among the most original and dynamic of all van Gogh's
compositions, in which the spear-like, slashing representation of
the flowers is echoed by the vibrancy of color,'' said a statement
from George Goldner, the Getty's curator of paintings and drawings.
``At the same time it is a picture of great poetry, as expressed in
the one white iris on the left side which, in its isolation, has a
special poignancy.''
   The painting was in private European collections until 1947,
when it was purchased for $80,000 by New York philanthropist Joan
Whitney Payson. After van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9
million in 1987, Payson's family decided to sell ``Irises'' and use
the proceeds to endow a charitable foundation.
   Brooks said she had informed the Paysons that the Getty had
acquired ``Irises.'' The family was ``absolutely thrilled'' the
public would be able to view the painting as part of a museum's
permanent collection, she said.
   In a statement released by Sotheby's, Bond said, ``I am very
pleased with this sale, particularly because this great masterpiece
will be on exhibition at such a pre-eminent museum.''
   The Getty, designed in the style of a first-century Roman villa,
overlooks the Pacific Ocean on the Los Angeles County coast. It is
one of seven programs operated by the Getty Trust. Admission is
free.
