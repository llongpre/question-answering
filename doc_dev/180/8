ALIAS OLYMPIA by Eunice Lipton Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 12.95, 181 pages
FOR EVERY one art lover who knows her name, thousands can instantly
recognise the face and body of Victorine Meurent. She was the bold model
with the tight little frame and steady, daring gaze whose depiction in
Manet's Olympia and Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe revolutionised European nude
painting and outraged the 19th century art world. Contemporaries called
Meurent 'a female gorilla' and marched through the Salon with sticks and
umbrellas to attack her portrait. Now she is something of a feminist
heroine, the plucky naked girl who stares out of the canvas defying male
expectations of submission, the star of a sexy fete champetre who refuses
her part in the erotic script.
Who was the woman behind the image? Alias Olympia is subtitled 'a woman's
search for Manet's notorious model and her own desire', and began as Eunice
Lipton's attempt to find out. Lipton is a distinguished art historian, but
she soon discovered that history had buried Meurent as a typical model -
prostitute, alcoholic, loser - nicknamed 'the Shrimp'. Meurent is known to
have painted as well as modelled, but records, documents and interest in her
were negligible. There seemed no book to be written.
But Meurent became for Lipton an obsession, and scholarly research a
detective trail of blazing personal urgency. With wit and perception, Lipton
describes how she lived, breathed and dreamt Meurent, how lacklustre
archivists and Parisian alleys drove her to paranoia, how she came to see
the Parisian model born a hundred years before her as an alter ego who
shared her own problems with family, lovers, feminism and the art
establishment. Biography merges into autobiography, art history into a novel
as she creates her own idealised Meurent: a defiant lesbian artist who
whizzes about Paris, sells her paintings, drinks alone in bars, does her own
thing.
The result is a clever, unorthodox, enthralling book which combines
criticism and fiction in elegant symbiosis. Lipton's overarching theme is
the century-old treatment of women as objects in art and culture, and the
way this continues to condition how women see themselves. Here Meurent is
the breakthrough, 'resisting centuries of admonition to ingratiate herself',
consigned to (patriarchal) historical oblivion as punishment. Manet, who
after all created the radical image, gets no credit.
But you do not have to agree with Lipton to enjoy her story. Her format
allows a plethora of juicy digressions - sharp words on the pampered,
male-bonded lives of Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, for example, snap into
an analysis of why Renoir and Manet and Monet endlessly depicted one other
painting, but never drew the women artists working. Lipton has inspired
hunches, admissions of uncertain assumptions or dead-end routes which a
narrower scholarly work would lose. Most dazzling is her confidence to turn
the tables on herself and unearth research that shows how pathetically an
ageing, down-and-out Meurent traded on the Manet connection: a final joke in
which Meurent refuses to play her author's game as trenchantly as she
declined to satisfy the 19th century viewer.
Alias Olympia joins a small, impressive genre of post-modern criticism -
Richard Holmes' Footsteps, Cecily Mackworth's offbeat account of Freud in
Lucy's Nose last year - where the academic search is the story, where loose
ends are not tied up and uncertainties are accepted and bring life to the
narrative. It is cultural history at once learned, provocative, original and
unstuffy.
