<LEADPARA>  WOOD that is exposed a great deal of the time to dampness or direct sunlight
is susceptible to weathering, mold, pests and decay. These in turn lead to
discoloration, warping, cracking and even soft, crumbling wood that may also
be riddled with holes or tunnels.;   The remaining dry days are a fine time to
repair these kinds of problems or take steps to prevent them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Many products have been developed to protect wood. Paint is probably the
most common; applied correctly, paint coats wood with a barrier that is
durable and relatively long-lasting. A sound exterior paint job should last
three to five years.;   Natural finish; But where a natural finish that
reveals the grain and color of the wood is desired, choices must be made among
a variety of clear or nearly clear products.;   The most basic of these is
water-repellent penetrating wood sealer. Its purpose is to prevent wood from
absorbing water, which can lead to warping and cracking and creates an
environment attractive to organisms. Thompson's Water Seal, made by Thompson &amp;
Formby Inc., is probably the best-known brand. It is available at virtually
all home centers at about $12 a gallon, usually enough to cover 200 square
feet.;   Before applying any water repellent, test a small area of the wood
for absorbency. Then apply only as much repellent as the wood will accept.;  
But water repellent alone will not protect wood from turning gray from the
effects of sunlight, nor will it prevent mildew and other growths. For
protection against sunlight, select a repellent containing an ingredient that
blocks ultraviolet rays. One repellent with a UV inhibitor is Thompson's Wood
Protector, which costs about the same as Water Seal; another, priced
competitively, is Olympic Waterguard Wood Formula, manufactured by PPG
Industries.;   Restore hue; Products with UV inhibitors are effective only on
wood that has not already changed color from exposure. But wood can be
restored to its original hue by washing it with a deck brightener; these come
in powdered form to be mixed with water for spraying or brushing and are
available at hardware stores. The cost is usually about $6 for enough to cover
150 square feet. Some popular ones are: Thompson's Wood and Deck Renewer,
Cuprinol Revive, Wolman Deck Brightener and Zar Wood Brightener.;   For
protection against algae, decay-causing fungi (leading to wet or dry rot) and
molds like mildew, some water repellents contain preservatives. Typically,
these products contain either zinc naphthenate or Polyphase (3-iodo-2-propynl
butyl carbamate) as the active ingredient. Some of the popular brands are
Cuprinol No. 20 Clear Wood Preservative (about $15 a gallon), DAP Woodlife
Wood Preservative ($17) and Wolman Clear Wood Preservative ($18).;   Only one
readily available preservative also contains insecticide for killing termites
and other wood-boring insects: Cuprinol No. 10 Green Wood Preservative, which
costs about $20 a gallon. Its active ingredient is copper naphthenate, which
gives wood a greenish tint.;   Preservatives need not be applied to
pressure-treated lumber, the kind typically used for decks and other
structures. This lumber has been saturated with a preservative, usually
chromated copper arsenate, that protects it for decades from insect attack and
decay. Often it, too, has a greenish tint.;   Damage-prone; But
pressure-treated wood is susceptible to moisture and sunlight damage and
should be coated as soon as possible with water repellent. Because the mill
finish of new pressure-treated wood limits absorbency, the best strategy for
giving it complete protection is to apply water repellent immediately, but
only as much as the wood will accept.;   Then allow the wood to weather for a
month to several months before cleaning it with deck brightener and applying
more water repellent, one with UV inhibitor, if desired.  </TEXT>
