   General Motors Corp., in an unusual move, said it agreed to have one of its suppliers operate the paint shop at a GM plant in Lansing, Mich. 

   The auto maker said PPG Industries Inc. of Pittsburgh will assume responsibility for the paint shop at GM's Buick Reatta Craft Centre. 
GM plans to introduce the Reatta, a two-seat luxury car, in the spring of 1988. 
It said all salaried staff employees in the paint shop will be employed eventually by PPG. Hourly workers will remain on GM's payroll but will be supervised by PPG, which makes automotive and industrial coatings and other products. 

   GM said it wants to apply PPG's expertise closer to the manufacturing process. 
But the move may also reflect an effort to subcontract work to outside vendors as part of a broader strategy designed in part to trim costs. 
The No. 1 auto maker in recent months has been shedding some small operations and has joined in joint ventures to make and market such products as its heavy truck line. 

   Terms of the agreement with PPG weren't disclosed.
