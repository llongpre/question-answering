   A Georgia O'Keeffe painting has been formally
declared ``lost'' by the Art Institute of Chicago, 20 years after a
search for the misplaced painting began.
   Officials of the prestigious museum had continued to hope over
two decades that the work, ``East River from the Shelton,'' would
turn up, Art Institute director James Woods said Tuesday.
   But after a recent inventory of 1,500 pieces in the museum's
department of 20th century paintings and sculpture, Wood said
officials acknowledged the painting was nowhere to be found.
   ``Frankly, the reclassification of the painting as lost from the
museum is long overdue,'' Woods said. ``The painting has been
missing for 20 years. We are acknowledging that unfortunate fact
now.''
   Museum officials stopped short of saying the work, valued at
between $250,000 and $500,000, was stolen. But they have notified
the FBI, Interpol and other officials that it is missing.
   ``One has heard of objects being lost in museums or even going
out with the trash,'' Wood said. ``So it still might be found here
or in the hands of an innocent person.''
   The 1926 painting, on a 12-by-32-inch canvas, depicts the view
from a Manhattan hotel in which O'Keeffe and her husband,
photographer Alfred Stieglitz, lived.
   Stieglitz's estate loaned the work to the Art Institute in 1949
and it entered the museum's permanent collection as a gift from the
artist in 1955.
   O'Keeffe, acknowledged to be on of the foremost 20th century
American artists, died in 1986. She is best known for her paintings
of large-scale flowers and semi-abstract paintings reflecting the
influence of years she spent in the American Southwest.
