   A Renoir portrait of his nephew sold for $7.04
million at an auction of the artworks with which Greta Garbo was
alone in her final years.
   The auction at Sotheby's on Tuesday night attested to the
public's enduring fascination with the reclusive actress and gave
the otherwise slumping art market a glamorous boost.
   While one of Garbo's Renoirs failed to sell, three other
paintings from her apartment on Manhattan's East Side sold for
$15.9 million, near or above the level expected by the auction
house.
   ``People like to own things that have been owned by famous
people,'' said auctioneer John Marion.
   Surprisingly to some, the paintings from the actress' sanctuary
depict intimate human scenes in brilliant colors.
   The Renoir that brought the highest price was ``Portrait of
Edmund Renoir Jr.,'' which went to an anonymous buyer. The 1889 oil
is a portrait of the son of Renoir's brother. The child has
waist-length blond hair and a dark blue coat.
   The painting's pre-sale estimate was $4 million to $6 million.
   The contents of Garbos's apartment being auctioned off this week
are estimated to be worth at least $20 million. Much of the value
is attributed to Garbo's ownership of the works.
   Also the auction block this week are hundreds of other items
from Garbo's apartment, including a carpet estimated to be worth
$50,000, upholstered chairs for $10,000 each, and a perfume bottle
in the shape of a wizard worth $600.
   The actress lived alone for 37 years in the building. She filled
the place with paintings and porcelain that she bought at Manhattan
galleries, where she was known as G.G. or ``Ms. Brown.''
   Renoir's ``Leontine and Coco'' brought $5.7 million. It also
went to an anonymous buyer. The 1909 oil depicts the artist's young
son, Coco, reading in the company of a young nursemaid.
   A third Renoir, ``Secret,'' did not sell. The highest bid was
$1.5 million, and did not meet the pre-sale estimate of $2 million
to $3 million. The 1897 painting shows an unidentified model and
composer Claude Terrasse.
   Pierre Bonnard's ``The Corn Poppies'' brought $3.19 million from
an anonymous buyer. It was painted circa 1914-15 and shows a
graceful white pitcher with a falling cherry design, and a small
dog in a chair.
   Also auctioned Tuesday was a collection of other Impressionist
and modern paintings.
   The highest price went for Monet's ``Water Lillies,'' which
brought $9.45 million against a pre-sale estimate of $7 million to
$9 million. It was bought by a Japanese dealer.
