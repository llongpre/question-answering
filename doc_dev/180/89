   A painting of a bridge by Vincent van Gogh sold for $20,240,000. 
The price ranked second in auction history, after the astonishing $39.9 million paid for a van Gogh sunflower painting in late March. 

   Christie's International PLC, which sold the painting at auction yesterday, would say only that the successful bidder was "a private, anonymous collector bidding on the telephone." 
The second-highest bidder was Neville Keating, a London art dealer, Christie's said. 

   Richard Feigen, a New York dealer who attended the auction, said the price was somewhat higher than his own estimate. 
"I thought it would bring #10.9 million (the price was #12.7 million)," Mr. Feigen said. 
"I think this shows that you have to discount the sunflowers, because it became a bidding war between two people. 
If this had gone into that same realm, it would have meant an enormous change in the art market. 
As it is, it shows the art market is still very, very strong." 

   Mr. Feigen said he believes the bridge painting, "Le Pont de Trinquetaille," is a "better, more important painting in better condition" than the sunflower painting, which a Japanese insurance company bought. 
Japanese buyers also were evident at yesterday's sale here, where a painting by Japanese impressionist Seiki Kuroda sold to a Japanese collector for $2.8 million. 

   The $20.2 million van Gogh beats the $11,088,000 paid at Christie's last December for a painting by impressionist Edouard Manet.
