   A sale of rock star Elton John's diverse
collection of art objects, furniture, stage clothes and memorabilia
topped $7 million at a Sotheby's auction Thursday.
   John's stuffed toys, fantasy objects and designer clothing
fetched $144,000 and his art collection sold for $1.3 million.
   The running total in the four-day sale reached $7.6 million, the
auction house said.
   Among items sold Thursday night was a replica of the state
throne of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, its wood frame covered in
gold leaf and enameled on the backrest with Egyptian hieroglyphics,
which fetched $15,800.
   More of John's furniture, ceramics, sculpture and miscellaneous
items, including amusement machines and walking sticks, were to be
auctioned Friday, the final sale day.
   The entertainer's stage costumes, memorabilia, furniture,
ornaments and jewelry were sold Tuesday and Wednesday.
   John, 41, has said he wants to make room in his mansion near
Windsor, west of London, to start new collections.
   Prices for about 300 lots of art, from Rembrandt etchings to art
nouveau posters and fashion designs, mostly went well above the
presale estimates, Sotheby's auction house said.
   The top price was $119,000 for a painting of a fish wearing a
rope of pearls by the Belgian surrealist, Rene Magritte. It was
bought by an anonymous customer from Brussels.
   Two pictures by northern England artist L. S. Lowry, who mostly
painted industrial scenes, sold for a total of nearly $150,000, or
$64,200 above estimate.
   A modern sculpture of a kneeling woman supporting a glass-top
table, by British artist Allen Jones, made $35,300.
   A 1934 costume design for a Paris theater by Erte, pseudonym of
Romain de Tirtoff, sold to a private collector for $27,000, a
record for the artist's work.
   Fantasy paintings by the living German artist Paul Wunderlich
also did well, one called ``Olympia with Leaf,'' based on Edouard
Manet's famous nude courtesan, ``Olympia,'' sold for $26,000.
