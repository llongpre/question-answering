   A Picasso self-portrait, a town house by Philip
Johnson and Andy Warhol's ``Shot Red Marilyn'' are among the 4,529
artworks going on the block here during a 12-day, $600 million
auction frenzy that got under way Tuesday night.
   Sotheby's and Christie's, the city's biggest auction houses,
hope to ring up $572 million in sales, and Habsburg, Feldman, a
Geneva-based auctioneer, was expecting to bring in up to $30.5
million for 57 Impressionist and modern paintings.
   ``There is a tremendous amount of interest and purchasing power
around the world,'' said John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's
North America. ``There is heavy buying from Europeans and
tremendous interest from the Far East, especially Japan. Korean
buyers are now emerging. And I would not count the Americans out,
either.''
   Sotheby's and Christie's were to auction 4,472 works, starting
with contemporary art sales this week.
   Among the paintings sold Tuesday night at Sotheby's were two
major drip paintings by Jackson Pollock: ``Number 8, 1950,'' which
went for $10.5 million, and ``Number 19, 1949,'' which fetched $3.6
million.
   The price paid for ``Number 8, 1950'' broke the record for a
Pollock painting, $5.72 million last year for ``Frieze.''
   Jeffrey Deitch, who bought ``Number 8'' for an anonymous
collector, called the price ``very advantageous ... Sometimes you
just get lucky.''
   ``Triptych May-June,'' done by Francis Bacon in 1973 and
inspired by the suicide of the artist's close friend, George Dyer,
sold for $5.7 million.
   Five sculptures by Claes Oldenburg were sold: ``Ice Cream
Sandwich,'' $370,000; ``Plate of Meat,'' $360,000; ``Bacon and
Egg,'' $450,000; ``Cheesecake from Javatime,'' $47,500; and ``Green
Beans,'' $240,000.
   Andy Warhol's ``Red Jackie,'' which portrays a ruby-lipped
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as first lady in 1963, sold for $750,000
_ more than twice the presale estimate.
   ``Red Marilyn,'' a 1964 depiction of Marilyn Monroe, will be
offered at Christie's on Wednesday. The estimate for the signed,
synthetic polymer silkscreen on canvas is $1.5 million to $2
million.
   Other Christie's offerings include ``Colored Alphabet,'' a
12-by-10{ inch oil and paper collage by Jasper Johns, estimated at
$1.5 million. The theme ``is, in fact, the alphabet. But it's in
vivid, overlapping colors: various shades of blue, yellow and red
with some black,'' said Roberta Maneker, a Christie's spokeswoman.
   A Sotheby sale next Tuesday features Gauguin's ``Mata Mua,''
circa 1892, completed during the artist's first trip to Tahiti.
Estimated at $20 million to $25 million, it is being sold by Jaime
Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune, and Baron Hans
Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a member of the advisory board of
Sotheby's Holdings.
   The same day, ``Yo Picasso,'' a 1901 self-portrait done in Paris
during the artist's ``blue period,'' is expected to command $15
million to $20 million. The seller is Wendell Cherry, president and
chief executive officer of Humana Inc., the Louisville, Ky.,
hospital management corporation.
   A Jackson Pollock triptych, a series of three drip paintings on
three canvasses in black, red and yellow, is expected to fetch $1.5
million to $2.5 million.
   A Sotheby's sale of 20th century decorative arts Saturday will
include the only town house designed by architect Philip Johnson.
The two-story minimalist house was commissioned in 1950 by Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller III. Andy Warhol called it ``the original New
York loft.'' Real estate taxes on it in 1988 came to $14,414.
   A Christie's impressionist sale on May 10 and May 11 is expected
to bring in $109 million to $149 million.
   The paintings include five Monets, including ``The Trees,
Autumn,'' estimated at $6 million to $8 million; seven Picassos; 10
Renoirs, including ``The Logue,'' ($2.5 million to $3.5 million),
which depicts a model and Renoir's brother, Edmond, a journalist,
peering through opera glasses, and four by Degas.
   The private collection of late movie producer Hal B. Wallis,
including two Monets, will be auctioned next week.
   Sotheby's is shooting for total sales of $260.9 million to
$340.8 million; Christie's aims for $169.9 million to $231.3
million.
