   Three early oil paintings by 19th
century Dutch master Vincent van Gogh have been stolen from a small
provincial museum in this southern town, the third theft in two
years of Van Gogh works.
   The paintings taken Wednesday night from the Noordbrabants
Museum were identified by the museum as ``The Sitting Farmer's
Wife'', ``The Digging Farmer's Wife'' and ``Wheels of the Water
Mill in Gennep''.
   Guy Jennings, an Impressionism expert at Christie's auction
house in London, said by telephone that such minor works by Van
Gogh are worth about $1 million each but would be virtually
impossible to sell on the open market.
   Peter Veenland, a member of the museum's board of directors,
confirmed the theft of the paintings, the museum's only three works
by the painter.
   Dutch radio quoted police as saying the paintings were stolen
from the museum 55 miles south of Amsterdam after entry was
apparently gained through a broken window.
   The alarm system at the museum was not functioning and police
were called by a neighbor who heard the sound of breaking glass,
the radio said.
   It did not say whether the alarm was disabled during the theft
or was out of order before the break-in.
   A police spokesman reached by phone would only confirm that the
paintings were missing.
   The paintings date from about 1884, known as the artist's
Brabant period, when he worked among the farmers and rural artisans
of the Brabant, which encompasses a large part of the southern
Netherlands.
   Paintings from Van Gogh's Brabant period are generally dark in
tone and employ none of the bright colors of his later French
period, which have brought record auction prices.
   ``They really are Flemish School pictures before he really
discovered Impressionism,'' said Jennings, the Christie's expert.
   ``The Sitting Farmer's Wife'' and `The Wheels of the Water Mill
in Gennep'' were on loan from the National Fine Arts Service, said
Service spokeswoman Marry de Zwaan. ``The Digging Farmer's Wife''
was owned by the museum.
   The vast treasure trove of art owned by the Dutch nation is not
insured.
   There was speculation in the Dutch art world that the paintings
were stolen for ransom rather than resale, since underground sales
of stolen art usually realize only 10-15 percent of a painting's
open market value, Jennings said.
   The most significant of the Dutch impressionist's works are held
by Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum near
the eastern Dutch town of Otterlo.
   In December 1988, three Van Goghs, including one version of his
famous depiction of rural poverty, ``The Potato Eaters,'' were
stolen from the Kroeller-Mueller.
   In May of that year, three other works by modern masters,
including Van Gogh's ``Carnations,'' were taken from Amsterdam's
Municipal Museum.
   All the stolen works were subsequently recovered.
   Wednesday's theft came during the final weeks of a major
exhibition of hundreds of Van Gogh's paintings and drawings at the
Van Gogh Museum and the Kroeller-Mueller.
   No thefts or vandalism have been reported at the show, which
marks the centenary of the artist's death.
