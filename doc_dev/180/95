   A Sotheby's auction of contemporary art brought
in $19.9 million, about half the amount expected in an end to a
recent price explosion, the auction house said.
   Sotheby's had expected the Tuesday sale to bring $39.6 million
to $52 million.
   ``The contemporary art market over the last few years has been a
price explosion, and what we have seen tonight is a return to price
levels of about November 1988,'' said Diana Phillips, a spokeswoman
for Sotheby's.
   The sale of 34 works of contemporary art brought prices back to
earth, Phillips said. Forty three other pieces did not draw minimum
bids and were not sold.
   The highlight of the auction was a 1961 work by American artist
Robert Rauschenberg, ``Third Time Painting.'' It fetched $3.08
million from a private European collector, said Phillips. The
estimate on the Rauschenberg was revised downward Monday, from
$4-$5 million to $3-$4 million.
   The Rauschenberg, showing a clock, a chain, a shirt and a broken
bottle neck, is combines oil, paper, fabric, wood, metal and glass.
   The sale of other works also reflected the soft market, pulling
down prices that increased about 20 times since 1984, most
dramatically in the past two years, Phillips said.
   The second highest price of the evening - $2.6 million - came
for French painter Jean Dubuffet's ``Maison Sondee,'' a 1961 Paris
scene. The oil on canvas was bought by a Chicago dealer.
   The third highest priced work, auctioned for $2.3 million, was
another Dubuffet, ``Vaches Au Pre.'' The oil on canvas painted in
1954 depicts one of Dubuffet's favorite subjects, cows.
   The American painter Cy Twombly's 1967 oil on blackboard,
``Untitled,'' sold for $1.9 million.
   ``Most of the sale was bought by private collectors who are
serious and committed,'' Phillips said. ``The speculators who have
been present during the price explosion were completely absent from
tonight's activity.''
   ``Many of the lots that did not sell were by artists whose works
have gained quickly in value over the last few years,'' she said.
