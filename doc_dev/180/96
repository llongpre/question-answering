   The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth is planning to
sell ``The Swimming Hole,'' a painting by 19th century American
artist Thomas Eakins, a newspaper reported.
   The painting, which was purchased for $700 in 1925, could bring
millions of dollars at auction.
   Owned by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, the painting of
six nude men and a dog has been on loan to the nearby Amon Carter
Museum since January 1988.
   Carter Museum director Jan Keene Muhlert said Wednesday the
painting was removed from display on Monday for shipment to New
York.
   An auction date of May 24 has been set at Sotheby's in New York,
sources told The Dallas Morning News.
   Modern Art Museum director E.A. Carmean Jr. would not comment on
the reported sale.
   Eakins is regarded as one of the most important 19th century
American painters.
