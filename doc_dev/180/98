Regional air quality officials on Friday slapped strict new controls on certain 
household paints and varnishes in an effort to improve air quality. The action 
was strongly criticized by paint manufacturers and contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The tough new rules, which will take effect in July and become even more 
stringent by the end of 1993, will affect between 15% and 25% of all paints and 
other architectural coatings sold in California. Total annual statewide sales 
of the affected products are estimated at $180 million by the Southern 
California Paint &amp; Coatings Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The controls will reduce the amount of smog-causing volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) in a category of architectural coatings known as specialty coatings -- 
quick-drying and high performance oil-based enamel paints, primers, sealers, 
undercoatings, stains, wood preservatives, varnishes, lacquers and shellacs. 
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions are another example of how the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District's sweeping 20-year plan to bring the four-county basin into 
compliance with federal clean air standards is having an impact on everyone 
from big industry to homeowners. The AQMD already has required employers in the 
region to provide incentives for employee car-pooling. And it is planning other 
steps that will affect back-yard barbecuing, dry-cleaners and household 
products such as cleansers and aerosol sprays. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a question of our concept of life style in this basin," said Pat 
Nemeth, AQMD deputy executive officer. The new paints and coatings, she said, 
may well be inferior to those now on the market. But, she said, that is the 
price that must be paid for cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations approved Friday do not affect the water-based latex paints most 
popular with do-it-yourselfers, or oil-based paints, lacquers and varnishes 
with high VOC levels sold in more costly, quart-size cans or smaller 
quantities. The new rules, the AQMD said, are aimed at discouraging large-scale 
use of the products while not banning them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Paint manufacturers and contractors warned that the rules not only will drive 
up the cost of home remodeling, but will cause reformulated white and 
light-colored oil-based paints to turn yellow within 60 days of application. 
The contractors predicted that the changes will force them to add polluting 
solvents to improve the quality of the reformulated products. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD estimates that the rule will reduce VOC emissions by 4.5 tons a day, 
or about 1.2% of all the VOC reductions the district hopes to achieve within 
the next five years. Overall, VOC emissions from stationary sources is 578 tons 
a day, with architectural coatings accounting for 64 tons of that, or about 
11%. The bulk of the emissions come from business and industrial plants in the 
basin, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
According to the AQMD, the price for primers and sealers could drop as much as 
$3.60 a gallon, chiefly because costly solvents will be reduced. But staining 
products could increase by $1.10 a gallon because more expensive solvents must 
be substituted in those substances. 
</P>
<P>
Volatile organic compounds, sometimes called hydrocarbons or reactive organic 
gases, are one of two prime ingredients of photochemical smog. They combine 
with oxides of nitrogen -- produced by combustion -- and in the presence of 
sunlight are transformed into ozone, a health-threatening air pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations were approved on a 7-2 vote after a five-hour public hearing on 
Thursday. Voting against the rule were Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich and Gov. George Deukmejian's appointee to the board, Stephen 
Albright. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's public hearing, paint contractors, some manufacturers and 
others said that reformulating oil-based paints to reduce VOCs would require 
more coats of paint or varnish and still result in lesser quality. But those 
contentions were disputed by the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
Industry spokesmen said the rule could actually increase pollution because 
contractors would likely add smog-forming solvents to improve the product's 
performance and because more coats would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"The manufacturers will get paid to make more paint, the contractor will get 
paid to put more on, and we'll all pay with our health due to increased 
emissions," Jim Sliff, technical services manger of Vista Paint Corp., told the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a crook. I feel like a cheat. I have to charge more money for more 
paint for less quality," said Anaheim painting contractor Don Salvatore. 
</P>
<P>
Others testified that painting contractors would add thinners and other 
smog-causing solvents to the reformulated paints and varnishes in attempts to 
improve them even though it would be illegal to do so. As VOCs are reduced, the 
paint becomes thicker and harder to handle, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really resent being put in the posture of being a criminal polluter," 
complained Mark Robson of Ram-Mar Painting Inc. in Hesperia. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials said the new limits, in some cases, will have the practical 
effect of banning some home uses of lacquers altogether. The new lacquers will 
be too thick to brush on at home. So, in the case of kitchen cabinets, for 
instance, homeowners may have to buy pre-finished cabinets that are stained or 
varnished at a factory where more polluting lacquers can be used because the 
factories have air pollution control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Once the regulations take effect, stores will have three years to sell stocks 
of inventories manufactured using the old formulas. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials said enforcement efforts will focus on professional contractors. 
Penalties range from $1,000 to $25,000 a day for illegal use.
