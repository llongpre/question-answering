   Thousands packed into China's top art gallery for
the opening of Beijing's first painting exhibition devoted entirely
to the study of nudes.
   Some leered and shook their heads in disbelief at what they saw,
but many others gazed with obvious appreciation at the works.
   Poets, top government officials, schoolchildren, young couples
and workers gathered Thursday around the paintings by some of
China's best artists.
   ``I feel this exhibition shows we have achieved a little more
freedom. In the past you would never see this,'' said Wang Xing, 22,
a student from Beijing Teacher's College as he viewed a study of a
man and a woman touching a bird. ``It also shows our level is
rising. The paintings here move me, they are beautiful.''
   ``Underneath, everyone is naked and everyone knows their
nakedness,'' said Ai Qing, who at 79 is China's best known living
poet. ``Why then, when we want to paint our bodies, do so many
Chinese think it's strange? I think it is good.''
   The Exhibition of Figure Oil Painting at the China Art Gallery
features 128 paintings by 21 artists. Gallery official estimated
that about 20,000 people came on the first day, paying about 27
cents each, five times the normal admission price.
   ``We have traditional nudes, realistic nudes, expressionist
nudes, abstract nudes, even cubist and deformist nudes,'' said Ge
Pengren, a painting instructor at the Central Institute of Fine Arts
who organized the show. ``Our purpose is to educate the people about
nudes and to show them, through these paintings, how we value life.''
   Ge said the exhibition, which was approved by the Ministry of
Culture before it was opened, hadn't met with any ``major
interference'' since it was sanctioned a year ago.
   ``When we chose the paintings, there was no censorship at all,''
he said.
   Artistic freedom in China is very limited. Books and movies have
to pass through a censor and artists are often restricted in what
they can create.
   During the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution from 1966-76,
painters were banned from displaying nude paintings and only in 1978
were they again allowed to use nude models.
   Society and the state have been slow in accepting the change.
   Newspapers carried a report earlier this year about a 19-year-old
girl who suffered a nervous breakdown because of the abuse she
received for posing nude at the Nanjing Academy of Fine Arts.
   In recent years, only two exhibitions devoted to nudes have
opened in China. In addition, a nude mural by Yuan Yunsheng, painted
in 1979 during a period of relative cultural freedom, remains
covered at the Beijing Airport.
   ``In the past, society's ideas about morality were a little
backward,'' said Ge. ``It was like we were afraid of our bodies.
With this exhibition, we want to open a new road.''
   Inded, the educational nature of the exhibition is very strong. A
lengthy explanation of the nude's place in art history lines the
middle of one hall. A discussion of the artists' work lines another.
   ``We still have to introduce things to the masses,'' said artist
Cao Li. ``Without this introduction, many people wouldn't understand
at all.''
   But even with the introduction, Fu Kegan was having a hard time.
   ``I'm going to stand here until I understand this painting,'' the
former teacher said as he stood, head shaking, in front of a gray
canvas.
   ``The artist told me this is an abstract nude,'' said Fu, 68.
``But it looks like a pile of rocks.''
   Despite his confusion, Fu said he welcomed such exhibitions.
   ``We hear that nude exhibitions in the West are normal,'' he
said. ``So why in China should they be so mysterious? This show
could teach people that nude painting isn't dangerous.''
   ``It may not be dangerous,'' said Wang Bing, 48, a housewife.
``But I think it's dirty. Look at those boys staring at that
painting.''
   Across the room, a pack of 20 men appeared perilously close to
diving into a painting of two Chinese women.
   ``Oh, there will always be uneducated people,'' Fu said. ``But
maybe this show will teach them to change.''
