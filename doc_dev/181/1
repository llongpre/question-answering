<TEXT>     "I want to promote my culture and history," he said. "I'm proud of my Latin
ancestry.";   Viveros, 34, paints the plumed serpent and other Aztec symbols
-- idols, warriors and sacrificial rituals -- on paper amate. The paper and
technique are more than 3,000 years old, but artists had abandoned the
procedure until Viveros discovered paper amate, made from the bark of a
Mexican tree, about two years ago while wandering through a bazaar in Mexico.;
  The paintings of flowers and birds were geared toward tourists, yet the
ancient paper appealed to Viveros.;   "There was something in my mind that
said this art is new and original," he said.;   Viveros said he doesn't know
of any other artists in the United States who use paper amate.;   "I'm
rescuing the technique so we can be proud of our Pre-Columbian ancestors,"
said Viveros, who was born and raised in Xalapa in the state of Veracruz.;  
Paper amate is crushed bark from amatl trees, which thrive in tropical weather
and only grow in Puebla in central Mexico and parts of Africa and the
Philippines. Viveros travels to Mexico about twice a year to buy the paper.
The paper, which costs $5 for a 14-inch-by-18-inch sheet, is handmade by
Indians, who strip the bark from trees and then smash the bark between a stone
and wood to create brown, white or cinnamon paper.;   The paintings are done
with a Pre-Columbian technique, but using acrylics. Bright and unblended
colors are used for the paintings. "The colors come alive on the paper," he
said.;   In his Campbell home studio, he creates symbolic paintings of the
Aztecs on paper amate. The paintings are displayed on a living room wall.;  
Viveros was a graphic designer in Mexico for two years before he moved to San
Jose in 1979. He is a graduate of the National School of Plastic Arts at the
University of Mexico in Mexico City. He takes sculpture, ceramic and metal
design classes at West Valley College. But to support himself as an artist, he
works full time at a Safeway store in East San Jose.;   Although Viveros also
creates surrealistic oil and acrylic paintings, pencil drawings and bronze
sculpture figurines, he now concentrates on paper amate because of the
attention from the public. At a recent exhibit of his artwork at the
Biblioteca Latino Americana, 690 Locust St., San Jose, people were most
interested in paper amate, he said. "Looking at these paintings makes people
proud of our Latin heritage," he said.;   Viveros teaches paper amate to
students at library-sponsored workshops and instructs a weekly class for the
Sunnyvale School District.;   During the workshops, Viveros tells students
about the Aztecs, a highly civilized group of Indians who lived in Mexico from
about 1200 to 1521, the year that Hernando Cortes led Spanish troops to
conquer the Aztecs.;   Viveros touches upon the ancient group's reputation as
warriors, their religious practices which included human sacrifices and their
gods. "I want the kids to realize that there was life before Christopher
Columbus," Viveros said. "I teach the kids about their Latin American culture
and then they show their knowledge through the paintings.";   Viveros said he
hopes the workshops offer a positive outlet for teens to speed their free
time. "A lot of kids have nothing else to do with their spare time, which
leads to gangs and trouble," he said. "I want kids to come to my workshops and
feel positive about themselves.";   He recently taught a workshop to 11
students at the Biblioteca Latino Americana. The free workshops are sponsored
by friends of the library groups. Viveros will teach a four-week workshop
beginning Dec. 10 at the Empire Library in East San Jose.;   The students'
paintings will be exhibited through Dec. 31. At the Biblioteca Latino
Americana during an artist reception last week, Jose Aquirre, 18, talked about
the meaning behind his painting to approximately 30 admirers. He painted a
skeleton, Indians, an eagle and Aztec gods.;   "When I think about Mexico, I
think about what's in my painting," said the De Anza College student.;   Mark
Lopez, 15, combined his drawing talent and architect career ambition to paint
a group of pyramids. "I learned about the Aztec culture and their life," said
Lopez, a sophomore at Pioneer High School in San Jose.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED;
Manuel Viveros will teach a four-week paper amate workshop for teens from 4 to
6 p.m. on Dec. 10, Dec. 17, Jan. 14, and Jan. 21. There will be a reception
for artists on Jan. 28 at the Empire Library, 491 E. Empire St. To register,
