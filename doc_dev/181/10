<LEADPARA>  WE all need something to soothe the ache in our souls these days.;   
Fortunately for you, I was struck down Tuesday by the Hades simplex mutant
intestinal virus, so that I have had plenty of time to lie very still on the
sofa and -- in between fever-driven visions of the feathered serpent
Quetzalcoatl -- turn the keen razor of my mind on the future of America.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     My gaze drifts aloft, to Venus.;    From Venus comes the only bit of good
news we have received all week. (It is not precisely clear to me why we are
able to know when somebody moves a crate of apricots across a gorge on Venus,
but we pretty much throw up our hands over whether Iraq has jets backed up
bumper to bumper on the inbound Hammurabi Expressway.);    Anyway, NASA has
come up with the news that there are spider-shaped volcanic bulges on Venus
(which, for a planet named after the goddess of love, turns out to have the
kind of big-time cellulite problems we would be more apt to associate with a
planet named after, say, Marge Schott).;    I have traditionally been a
detractor of NASA because (a) it's in my nature, generally, to detract; I
can't help that, and (b) I believe NASA has not come up with very much for the
commonweal except for the occasional polymer-coated technological marvel, such
as John Glenn.;    In this instance, however, I believe the NASA people are
onto something. They theorize that these spider-shaped bulges were formed when
huge blobs of molten rock inside Venus rose upward, creating fissures, bulges,
volcanic dikes and lava flows.;    Scientists now think the surface of Venus
is shaped by what they call (no kidding) "blob tectonics," the process by
which enormous giblets of molten rock drift upward toward the surface. On
Earth, this process resulted in the formation of the Hawaiian Islands as well
as Morton Downey Jr. (Well, nobody's that grown up.);    The idea that Venus
is seething with hot molten rock is a fairly new one because Venus is covered
with thick clouds. In 1918, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius theorized that
Venus must be covered with seas, swamps and steamy jungles, which might well
be inhabited by primeval monsters. Because of all the clouds, you see.
Arrhenius won a Nobel Prize. Boy, they were handing them out like Mylanta
tablets back then.;    When this war is over, let's face it, an oil change is
going to cost about the same as filling your crankcase with morel mushrooms.
So we need a new source of energy, and blob tectonics could be the answer.;   
Why couldn't we heat our homes and power our turbines with all that nice hot
magma sloshing around up on Venus?;    Because, you say, it's on Venus.;   
That is the difference between you, a moiling scullion in the common ruck, and
me, a lofty visionary.;    Here is my scheme: We install the
Inter-Solar-System Venus-to-Earth Molten-Rock Pipeline. (Faithful readers of
this column may wish to leaf back a few years in their carefully maintained
laminated loose-leaf binders and marvel at the resemblance of this plan to my
previous Alaskan Ice Cream Roll Pipeline).;    We run this pipeline (some kind
of heat-proof, flexible tubing -- get the guys who did the McDLT box right on
it) down from Venus to, let's say, Hamilton, Ohio.;    I realize it's going to
obstruct the view a little, but what's there to look at in Hamilton, Ohio?
Anyway, President Gephardt (it's inevitable, now) isn't going to stick it in
Missouri, is he? Plus, you'll get tourists.;    We're moving fast here, I
realize, but is everyone still with me? We get the hot rock from Venus. Who's
going to kick about it? They got no Sierra Club up there. Once we set up the
pipeline, it's easier than pumping oil because it's all downhill, right?;   
So all I've done is figured out a way for us to get free energy, pay off the
national debt and thumb our noses at the rest of the world. (It's the American
way.);    Now try to keep things running smoothly for a while. It's too much
trouble for me to be getting sick all the time.  </TEXT>
