THE MEXICAN Revolution of 1910 drastically altered Mexico's artistic climate, 
freeing native artists from the prevailing French and Spanish standards of the 
time. Later, in the 1930s, with the importation of modern offset presses to 
print large color images, many painters discovered they could earn a living as 
commercial artists in the growing advertising business.

The sophistication of Mexican advertising art (used most often in the 1930s to 
publicize cigarettes and beer) is showcased (through Sept. 16) at The Old 
California Store, an antiques shop in Ventura specializing in California Rancho 
themes.

"There's a similarity in styles in '30s Mexican and American art," says Don 
Shorts, co-owner of The Old California Store, though, he says, the Mexican 
pieces are more ethnic and regionalized, stressing pre-Columbian and Aztec 
influences. The collection includes about 30 rare color lithographs, most 
dating back to the '30s, the art form's heyday. Prints measuring 16x24 inches 
run about $175.
