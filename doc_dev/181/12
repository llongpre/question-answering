   Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of
Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be
another ancient Mexican civilization.
   So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four-ton
stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a
19-inch-high clay figure of a fertility-rite priest.
   ``But,'' says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the
Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, ``the finds are so promising that
the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of
Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic
Society.''
   The stele was found in November 1986. It is covered with
inscriptions in an unknown language but with some Mayan numerals.
   The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a
flayed sacrificial victim.
   Both are about 1,800 years old.
   ``That would place them in the second century A.D., which is
after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from
around 1050 to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around
the fourth century A.D,'' Winfield said in an interview.
   Adding to the intrigue, the Mayas lived in the Yucatan
Peninsula, more than 700 miles to the east, Winfield said at the
museum in Xalapa, where the stele and figure are kept.
   ``But there are two dates on the stele in Mayan writing, in
their so-called Long Count Calendar made up of dots and bars,
equivalent to May 22, 143 (A.D.), and July 13, 156 A.D.,'' Winfield
said.
   If the mysterious people did exist, Winfield said, they also
appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known
civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast: the Totonacas, who
emerged around the seventh century A.D. in the area where the
artifacts were found, or the Huaxtecas farther north, about one
century later.
   ``They could be the Xicalancas, of which Clavijero briefly
talked about,'' Winfield said, referring to the Rev. Francisco
Javier Francisco Javier Clavijero (1731-1787), a Jesuit priest who
was the first to systematically study Mexico's ancient languages
and peoples.
   In his ``History of Ancient Mexico,'' Clavijero in three lines
briefly mentioned the Xicalanca civilization in relation to the
Olmecs, but did not go into details.
   In ``nahuatl,'' the trading language of the Aztecs, who came
much later, Xicalanca means ``the people who live by the Great Body
of Salt Water,'' as the Gulf of Mexico was called.
   The two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in
the village of La Mojarra, where the Piojo River meets the Acula
River. The crocodile-infested region is so swampy that it can be
reached only by boat, Winfield said.
   La Mojarra, with a population of fewer than 200, is up the Acula
about 20 miles south of the port of Alvarado in Veracruz state. But
neither the village nor the Piojo River can be found on any map of
Mexico.
   Carved in relief on the previously polished stele, which is of
basalt, one of the world's hardest rocks, is the full length
profile of a regal figure, a man about 25 years old, holding out in
both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering.
   ``He was probably a ruler, or a chief warrior, or a high priest
_ or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region
in ancient times,'' Winfield said.
   The figure wears ear-stops, a tall headdress adorned with four
representations of something like a rain god, trimmed with eight
feathers, and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over
what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic.
   A total of 577 glyphs, or picture-words, divided into 21 neat
rows running from top to bottom, plus 33 ``elements'' like the
rain-god representations, cover the rest of the slab.
   ``It was all carved during one continuous period,'' Winfield
said. ``It was a single piece of work. It is the oldest and richest
piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient Mexico.''
   About 7 feet tall, slightly oblong and with a gently rounded
top, the stele once stood on the right bank of the Acula, just
outside La Mojarra.
   Over the years, erosion toppled it, and it lay in the river
until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of
villagers.
   Archaeologists retrieved the stele, but Winfield said he kept
the find quiet for two years so work could proceed ``without the
pressure that such a discovery creates.''
   The second piece, the ceramic figure of a priest made with the
region's thick orange clay, has a square base. It is the only one
of two artifacts from that area with a base. The other, also in the
museum, is so badly damaged it cannot be studied, Winfield said.
   In the La Mojarra figure, only the head is missing.
   That type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf
cultures. The Aztecs called it in Xipe Totec, or the Lord of the
Flayed, and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring, of
fertility, of abundance and of the metalworkers.
   A peasant at La Mojarra found the shattered figure many years
ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces
in a cardboard box.
   ``We got wind of it three weeks ago, and we convinced him to let
the museum have it,'' Winfield said.
   Winfield suspects the La Mojarra area could have been a
ceremonial site.
   ``If so, there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be
found,'' he said.
