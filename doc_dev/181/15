VERACRUZ, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The only madhouse with a sea view." That's how one Jarocho, as locals here are 
known, characterizes this city. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the boisterous street life of this bustling port on the Gulf of Mexico 
frequently verges on the insane. Veracruz's zocalo has a reputation, in fact, 
as Mexico's liveliest central square. 
</P>
<P>
And at this time of the year things get even livelier. The week before Lent 
brings the annual carnaval, and to understand it, a visitor first must 
understand what passes for normal in Veracruz, especially around the white 
colonnaded zocalo. 
</P>
<P>
In sidewalk bars, white-shirted waiters pile bottles of beer precariously on 
tables already overloaded with empties. Mariachi bands serenade the crowd, 
while strolling trumpeters, harpists and marimba players in silver-trimmed 
uniforms and oversized sombreros offer song lists to prospective customers. A 
white-faced mime, or perhaps a troupe of lavishly costumed dancers, performs 
for an audience gathered around the central fountain. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a moving market threads its way between the cafe tables. 
Vendors offer goods of all kinds -- silk hammocks and pistachios, cigarettes 
and embroidered dresses, preposterous model ships several feet long and 
elaborately rigged, even Polaroid snapshots to commemorate your evening in 
Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
This is everyday Veracruz. But the city really comes into its own during the 
weeklong carnival, when it plays host to one of the biggest fiestas between New 
Orleans and Rio de Janeiro. This year it is set for Feb. 20-28. 
</P>
<P>
All work comes to a halt during the carnival, and everyone -- visitor and 
native alike -- gets down to the serious business of having fun. Each day the 
streets are filled with colorful parades that begin in mid-afternoon, when 
revelers have recovered from the festivities of the night before, and last into 
the early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age beauty queens wave from atop outlandish floats (a giant fish on 
wheels, for instance), uniformed bands march endlessly, and neighborhood 
musicians play odd instruments that have no names in English. 
</P>
<P>
Squalls of confetti fill the air. Salsa, rumba, tango, calypso -- all the music 
of the Caribbean dances its way past the crowds watching from street level or 
from balconies. Many people sport elaborate costumes -- some older folks, for 
example, dress in the fashions of their youth, while others parade about 
disguised as the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl or perhaps as Batman. 
</P>
<P>
The carnival has always carried an undertone of social and political satire 
amid the festivity. This has not always set well with the authorities, but 
attempts by government to tone down the exuberance have invariably failed. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as in years past, the first of more than 40 floats will celebrate 
the ritual burning of Bad Humor, a larger-than-life, papier-mache character 
dressed in black and scowling. In previous carnivals, Bad Humor has lampooned 
corrupt politicians or police officials. This year former Panamanian dictator 
Manuel Noriega is one candidate for the role; another is President Bush. 
Jarochos like to poke fun through their choice and at the same time make a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of the carnival there is the symbolic funeral of Juan Carnaval, 
not a papier-mache caricature this time but a real person who wanders about the 
city surrounded by grieving women draped in mourning attire. Juan will, of 
course, be reborn the following year. 
</P>
<P>
In between the burning of Bad Humor and the mock funeral of Juan Carnaval, the 
city throws what is virtually a nonstop party. All-night dances fill the 
plazas. Fireworks erupt almost continuously. The spirit is intoxicating, and 
those who begin as spectators usually end up as participants. 
</P>
<P>
Veracruz's light-hearted approach to life may well be a result of its turbulent 
past. 
</P>
<P>
In 1519, Hernando Cortes and his army of Spanish Conquistadors landed at the 
tiny island of San Juan de Ulua in Veracruz harbor. They negotiated with envoys 
of the Aztec emperor Montezuma, set up a shrine to the Virgin Mary and founded 
the first Spanish town in the Americas. They optimistically named it Villa Rica 
de la Vera Cruz -- the Rich Town of the True Cross. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan de Ulua and the harbor were vital in the country's trade and defense. 
In the 16th Century the port was repeatedly attacked by pirates, and after such 
infamous marauders as John Hawkins and Francis Drake successfully plundered 
Veracruz, the authorities of New Spain fortified the island. Even so, during a 
17th-Century raid the soldiers stationed at the fort deserted their posts 
because they hadn't been paid, and the town succumbed to Dutch buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Today the "island" of San Juan is connected by a highway to the mainland and is 
home port to naval ships and enormous industrial tankers, signs of Veracruz's 
latter-day development as the largest city and busiest port in the oil-rich 
state of Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-minute bus ride from the town center, the old fort, in contrast to the 
concrete jungle of the shipyards, looks like a kindergartner's idea of a 
castle, complete with moat, drawbridge and dungeons. Its wind-swept balustrades 
look out over the Gulf of Mexico. Deep inside are dank, rough-hewn dungeons 
known as Glory, Purgatory and Hell. It is hard to believe that any of them were 
anything but hellish. 
</P>
<P>
Centuries after the last pirate attack the harbor continued to play a role in 
Mexico's defense. During the War of Independence, San Juan's fort was the final 
stronghold of the Spanish, who were expelled by anti-colonial forces after a 
long and bloody battle in 1825. In the so-called Pastry War of 1838, the French 
invaded Veracruz, claiming that the Mexican government owed them money for 
damaged property. The supposedly impregnable fort of San Juan capitulated 
readily to France's superior firepower. But the French later were persuaded to 
withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also invaded Mexico, twice using Veracruz as the starting 
point. During the Mexican-American War in 1847, Gen. Winfield Scott attacked 
Veracruz, leading troops hurriedly through the town on the way to Mexico City 
to avoid the perennial yellow fever that plagued the coastal area. 
</P>
<P>
During the Mexican Revolution, Woodrow Wilson sent the U.S. fleet to subdue 
Veracruz and hence protect the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
To honor the town's resistance to those four foreign invasions, Veracruz 
officially proclaims itself "four times heroic." 
</P>
<P>
The Museo Cultural de la Ciudad, Veracruz's city museum on Avenida Zaragoza 
between Calle Canal and Calle Morales, celebrates these feats. It also offers 
intriguing details on the town's history, such as the number of times it burned 
down during the 17th Century (four, aided by fierce northerly winds) and major 
goods that once passed through the port (such as hand grenades, silk and olive 
oil from Spain, and chile, cocoa, tobacco and gold from the colony). 
</P>
<P>
Frequent epidemics during the 17th and 18th centuries, due to its humid 
tropical climate and mosquito-infested jungles, earned Veracruz the nicknames 
"Port of Hell" and "Graveyard of the Living." 
</P>
<P>
Early Spanish settlers hurried inland to more civilized regions. Left behind in 
Veracruz were sailors, merchants, Caribbean and African slaves, and random 
wanderers just looking for a good time. 
</P>
<P>
Out of this multicultural blend of starry-eyed adventurers and sturdy vagabonds 
emerged the Jarocho, or Veracruz native. Jarocho culture is reckless, 
irreverent, insubordinate, and has produced some memorable political escapades. 
</P>
<P>
In the 17th Century, for example, an Angolan slave named Yanga -- who was 
either a bandit or liberator of the oppressed, depending on whom you talk to -- 
led the first slave revolt in the New World. In this century vociferous 
Veracruz prostitutes ignited a tenants' rebellion that helped precipitate a 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Modern Jarochos are more laid-back than revolutionary; they talk slowly, dress 
casually, and excel in music and dance. Music is inescapable. In the zocalo 
alone, you hear four or five varieties at once on almost any evening throughout 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Those visitors inspired to try swinging to the Latin beat should head for La 
Bamba, a waterfront club named after the world-famous dance that supposedly 
originated in Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
At a little bar called La Bella Epoca, two blocks southwest of the zocalo on a 
pedestrian alleyway, a band of funky old men play guitars, drums and percussive 
gourds in the home-grown style of "sol" -- not soul, but sun -- which began in 
the 1940s. The bar's regulars, who look old enough to know, claim that the same 
individuals who play today were among the founders of this syncopated, eclectic 
musical style. 
</P>
<P>
Jarochos are fond of music and equally fond of good food, particularly seafood, 
which is fresh and inexpensive here. The best seafood restaurants are in the 
village of Boca del Rio, on the Rio Jamapa about five miles south of Veracruz. 
There the restaurant most often recommended is Pardino's, which is a little 
more upscale than the rest, serving such dishes as octopus or sea bass with 
Veracruzana sauce -- a delicious mixture of onion, garlic, tomatoes, olives, 
green pepper and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
A good place in Veracruz to try some traditional Mexican favorites, meanwhile, 
is Restaurant Tlaquepaque, three blocks from the zocalo. There, combinations of 
marinated meats and fresh vegetables on tortillas can be enjoyed for less than 
$5 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations are no problem in Veracruz, either, except during the carnival. 
The city has an enormous range of hotels, all of which are reasonably priced by 
U.S. standards. For a visit during carnival time, reservations must be made 
months ahead. A few rooms are available for this year's event, but only in the 
budget hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The most luxurious hotel on the zocalo is the Hotel Veracruz, where lovely 
air-conditioned rooms cost about $75 a night. Those who prefer a beach-side 
setting would do well to check out the architecturally splendid Hotel Mocambo, 
a few miles south of town at Playa Mocambo. The Hotel Mocambo has an outdoor 
pool set among spacious patios. Rooms are about $60 a night. More lavish and 
more expensive resorts share the same stretch of coast, where the dark-sand 
beaches are the best in the area. 
</P>
<P>
For the more budget-minded traveler, several hotels near the zocalo -- such as 
the Hotel Imperial, the Concha Dorado and the Hotel Rex -- make up in charm 
what they lack in luxury, offering reasonable accommodations for less than $15 
a night. 
</P>
<P>
How to get there: Veracruz is easily reached from Mexico City. Mexicana offers 
40-minute flights from the capital twice a day. First-class ADO buses take 
about six hours, and leave hourly. There are no direct flights to Veracruz from 
the United States.
