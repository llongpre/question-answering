It takes quite a mental leap to enter the world of ancient Mesoamerica from our 
contemporary, urban cocoon. The shift in sensibilities is dramatic and may even 
evoke some surprising jealousies if one contrasts today's techno-efficient 
mind-set with the sturdy spiritual and aesthetic scaffolding that framed 
Mesoamerican culture. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty and integrity of the work in the Mingei International Museum's 
current show, "Precolumbian Flora and Fauna: Continuity of Plant and Animal 
Themes in Mesoamerican Art," help make that mental leap inviting. Once 
transported, the ingenuity of form and depth of belief so abundant in the show 
can both nourish and instruct the mindful viewer. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit (through Feb. 17) does more than offer a rich survey of painted, 
carved and modeled animal and plant forms from present-day Mexico and its 
southern neighbors. It reminds us of what we have lost and may never recapture: 
a cycle of respect among the species, an interdependence that ensures mutual 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
The Mingei show focuses on the continuity of certain motifs and belief systems 
across Precolumbian cultures, but the work itself speaks more of distinction, 
of individuals' creativity, their endless, marvelous permutations on familiar 
forms and functional objects. 
</P>
<P>
Both the show and its well-illustrated catalogue are divided into four 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
The first three represent the three tiers of the Precolumbian cosmos -- air, 
earth and underworld -- and the final section presents contemporary examples of 
thematically related folk art from the Mesoamerica region. 
</P>
<P>
"Precolumbian man used animals to understand and order natural phenomena," 
explains guest curator Jeanette Favrot Peterson in her catalogue essay. 
</P>
<P>
"Ancient societies structured their world view using plant and animal 
metaphors; they endowed their deities with powers symbolized by fauna and 
flora; their ruling elite borrowed from nature those characteristics they 
wished to emulate and control." Hence, when a Mayan ruler wore a waterlily 
insignia, the flower's associations with agricultural canals and the watery 
underworld bestowed power to the ruler over fertility and the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
Tight visual and conceptual links bound the earth to its occupants in 
Precolumbian culture, which spanned roughly 3,000 years, from about 1,500 B.C. 
up to the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1521. The crocodile, for example, was 
one of several fish-like creatures that came to symbolize the earthly realm, 
for it floated on water, just like land, resting atop the fluid underworld. 
Further, the patterns on the backs of crocodiles, turtles and toads were 
compared to the geometric patterns of tilled fields. And the snake's shedding 
of its skin each year came to represent the Earth's own seasonal renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitivity to the form, texture and behavior of animals ran high among the 
Olmec, Maya and Aztec cultures, and the candor and energy of the animal figures 
here bear witness to the artists' close observation as well as his belief in 
the animals' spiritual power. A clay monkey effigy (550-800 A.D.) with a 
sacrificial rope around its neck wears an expression of uncanny honesty, as if 
aware of the higher meaning bestowed upon his life and death as purveyor of 
creativity and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs, though domesticated, were also eaten and offered as sacrifices to the 
gods in ancient Mesoamerica, which comprised Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, 
most of Mexico and parts of Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Most of the 
canine figures capture the animal's frisky, friendly nature, nuzzling into 
another's neck, gnawing on a bone, or squirming on its back, with legs poking 
up into the air. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to depict essences of form and character overshadow any concern for 
detailed representation. Forms are often simplified and generalized. This 
paring down not only heightens the vitality of the forms but lends them 
integrity as abstract design, a fact not lost on such early 20th-Century 
modernists as Picasso and Braque. 
</P>
<P>
Form and function meld gracefully in vessels whose openings double as dog 
tails, or whose handles are formed by the arching body of a bird. In one Mayan 
vessel of buff clay, a cylindrical base incised with delicate patterns supports 
a horizontal fish. The vessel's opening, a large round hole in the creature's 
belly, echoes the shape of the fish's bulging eye and is subtly framed by the 
arch of its fins. 
</P>
<P>
The show concludes with a small selection of masks, vessels and ritual objects 
from contemporary Mexico and Central America. Native beliefs have persisted, 
despite the Spanish imposition of Christianity in the 16th Century, and the 
continuity of themes and motifs during Precolumbian times still holds today.
