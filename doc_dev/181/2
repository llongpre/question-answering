Forest Lawn, the cemetery outfit that brought you replicas of Leonardo da 
Vinci's "Last Supper" in stained glass and Michelangelo's "David" in marble, 
has added an attraction at its memorial park in the Hollywood Hills: copies of 
ancient Mexican artifacts in sandstone, concrete and plaster. 
</P>
<P>
The park's Plaza of Mexican Heritage, completed in 1987, includes full-scale 
copies of mosaics, sculptures and glyphs from the Olmec, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, 
Toltec, Mayan, Aztec, Huastec and Totonac cultures. 
</P>
<P>
There's a circular calendar stone copied from one found buried in Mexico City, 
a sacrificial chacmool figure from the ruins at Chichen Itza, a bas-relief from 
the ball court at El Tajin, and a god of pulque, the pungent fermented wine 
said to have led to the downfall of Quetzalcoatl, the priest-leader of Tula. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza also features subtropical plants native to the lush environment of 
southern Mexico and desert plants from the arid areas of northern Mexico.
