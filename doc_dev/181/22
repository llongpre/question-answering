FACES 
</P>
<P>
"In art you need some tragedy. Where would we be without that?" asks 
Leningrad-based painter Gleb Bogomolov, referring to a 40-year period in which, 
he says, the development of Russian art was "completely cut off." 
</P>
<P>
Bogomolov should know about that tragedy in Russian art; he has long been 
recognized as a leader of the Soviet Union's underground art scene. But 
Bogomolov was one of the lucky ones. He has been able to make an underground 
living through his work, which he has been selling to foreign diplomats and 
collectors for more than 10 years -- long before Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is included in "Keepers of the Flame: Unofficial Artists of Leningrad" 
at USC's Fisher Gallery through Jan. 19. In addition, he has his first Los 
Angeles solo show at George Mayers Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard through Dec. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
"My condition has not changed, except that now I can go abroad, I can travel 
with my works," says the artist, who is currently on his first visit to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although his English is excellent, the 57-year-old artist with the ready grin 
insists on using an interpreter so that the "subtle nuances" of his 
conversation will be understood. Frequently, however, he finds himself helping 
out the interpreter with those very nuances. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, since being officially "recognized" by the Soviet 
government, Bogomolov has shown at several prestigious Soviet institutions, 
among them the Russian Museum, Far East Museum, Museum of Leningrad and 
Moscow's Museum of Modern Art. He has also shown in Norway and Sweden, and is 
currently featured in the large-scale exhibition "The Quest for 
Self-Expression: Painting in Moscow and Leningrad, 1965-1990" at Ohio's 
Columbus Museum of Art. But times were not always so easy for the artist, who 
left his state job as an engineer 13 years ago to devote himself to life as an 
underground artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something contrary to society," Bogomolov remembers. "Before 
perestroika, we were to be a (slave) to what we were told. But I was always 
doing what I wanted to do. I was supposed to work officially, but I didn't want 
to do it, even though they could imprison me for having no official job. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult trying to be an artist. They tried to stop my work," 
continues Bogomolov, who had no formal art training, but began making art while 
still a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always striving for avant-garde work," he says. Bogomolov did not become 
an "official artist," he says, because he did not want to always paint what he 
was told to, or paint in the official style of Socialist Realism. 
</P>
<P>
He notes, however, that because his work relies heavily on old Russian icons, 
he may be seen more as following old traditions that new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the avant-garde often leans on old traditions," he says. "I 
always turn to the tradition of icon painting because I think our modern times 
and ancient culture are very connected to each other. We have the literal 
result now of what was happening in ancient times." 
</P>
<P>
In his mixed-media paintings, Bogomolov often depicts "only vague remains of 
something that is not understood" thus causing the viewer to "guess" the 
piece's meaning. Such is the case with "Shrine," a work included in the USC 
show, which features only one clear element, a hand of playing cards 
representing "absolute mockery and a challenge that takes away from old history 
and culture." 
</P>
<P>
"I think (works like this) are a consequence of my experiences of spiritual 
tragedy," Bogomolov says of the suffering he underwent as an "unofficial" 
artist in the Soviet Union before Gorbachev's reforms.
