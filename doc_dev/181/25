With city government funds available to individual artists for the first time 
through the L.A. Endowment, an exhibition at Cal State Northridge's North 
Gallery seems timely. The exhibition, "The Fugue," documents artist Jack 
Reilly's execution and installation of a public arts commission in the city of 
San Diego (a steel sculptural painting on the 120-foot wall adjacent to the 
entrance of the County of San Diego's new Health Services Complex). 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes photo documentation of Reilly's work in progress, 
models from the original proposal, a scaled-down version of one of the pieces, 
and a 30-minute video documentary of the entire process. 
</P>
<P>
The North Gallery is on the college campus, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge. The 
short-lived exhibition closes on Friday.

emerging Los Angeles artists advance their careers, has selected Mark Moore,
