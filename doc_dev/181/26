FROM Antwerp to Zonhoven, cultural events with a Mexican accent spatter the
map of Belgium from now until Christmas. Mexico in Europe is the title of
Europalia 93. Events span the conventional arts and go beyond to include
horsemanship, numismatics, literature (presided over by Octavio Paz and
Carlos Fuentes), and papel picado or paper-cutting. Free to all comers is an
seven-day linguistics seminar on Mexican Spanish at Antwerp.
But what is Europalia? The unkind answer would be, a Belgian arts festival
which leaves the French cold and blank looks from most culturally aware
Britons. Yet Europalia has quite a pedigree. It was set up in 1969 as a
non-profit making, multi-disciplinary biennial arts festival to provide a
cultural window onto the member states of the EC. In 1989, it drew 1,660,000
visitors. A measure of devolution has crept in and events now spill over to
Maastricht, Rotterdam, even Paris.
Certain EC countries have yet to take the stage - Luxemburg for one, Ireland
for another. In 1989, Portugal declined on grounds of expense (her turn came
in 1991). The foundation's invitation to Japan threw Europalia open to all
comers; Scandinavia and Turkey currently contend for the 1995 slot.
Staging Europalia is not cheap. Belgium covers all costs within the country,
the guest nation pays the rest. This year, Mexico's costs were approximately
Dollars 20 million while Belgium's were roughly half, which is the standard
proportion. Where formerly there was a plethora of sponsors, this year, in
addition to the National Lottery, the Belgian end has six 'structural'
sponsors, each contributing BFr10 million: Alcatel Bell, Batiments et Ponts
Construction, Bekaert, Belgacom, Generale de Banque, and Swift.
So much for the Europalian nuts and bolts. In my own area of the visual
arts, Mexico has fielded some sumptuous exhibitions and others which sound
promising but I had no time to see. Sinister and heavy with the reek of
blood, Mayan archaeology is the festival's glory. Two large exhibitions must
be seen; The Eagle and the Sun, at the Palais des Beaux-Arts until December
19, and Maya-Metropolis at the Musees Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in
Cinquantenaire Park until December 24.
A statue out of a nightmare, lifesize on a high plinth, stands guardian to
'The Eagle and the Sun'. It is made out of modelled and cast sections of
blackish-red like a ghastly mechanical toy. A human torso and legs balance
on feet with triple talons curved upwards. The face and huge ears of this
god of Oaxaca are clearly those of a bat. With its gaping mouth and four
great canine teeth, there seems every reason to believe that the three clay
bells on its neck sounded the death-knell for human sacrifices.
'Anthropomorphised mouse, Zapotec culture' is as far as the label goes and
the catalogue, beautifully photographed though it is, is not much more
informative. This is not an exhibition which seems to want to instruct its
public nor is it stylishly displayed. Yet despite this, the show is a
memorable introduction to pre-Columbian art.
It aims to be more, the theme being 3,000 years of Mexican art from the
Oltecs (1200-600 BC) to Frida Kahlo. However, Mexico after its conquest by
Hernan Cortes in 1521, is on the whole only thinly evoked with certain
exceptions from New Spain. My favourites were a remarkable 17th-century
painted genealogy of the family of Mendoza Moctezuma and four paintings by
Miguel Cabrera in the genre of scenes illustrating New Spain's rigid caste
system.
The pre-Columbian rooms are surely where you will want to linger. More than
100 pieces have been sent by museums all over Mexico, for the most part
sculptures, some of them large and of superb quality. A number of the best
pieces stand free of glass cases like the vampire-god, which increases the
almost palpable air of menace.
Many figures peer through rings strangely like spectacles or have skin
welted by snaking cicatrices. Some of the more human creatures sit on the
ground, cross-legged or hunched. Warriors, priests, or victims, they serve
gods who stand four-square under their plumed head-dresses displaying the
emblems of divinity, eagles, serpents, the skulls which to this day are
omnipresent in Mexican folk-art.
A statue of a god of the Totonacs clasps a severed head by a handle as if it
were his handbag. He comes from the Gulf of Mexico and belongs to the
centuries equivalent to Europe's Gothic age. To form a picture of which
peoples were active when, Maya-Metropolis is the far and away the better
show, a survey of the Mayan city-states from the Yucatan to the Nicaraguan
frontier in the classical and post-classical period (200-1500AD).
The aim is to show how distinct these city-states were. Anyone not reading
French (or Dutch) is at a disadvantage although the show has a a clear
lay-out. Essentially it is one large space mapped chronologically into
city-states - Bonampak, Jaina, Chichen Itza, Palenque, and so on. Stylish
design puts stepped details and turquoise decoration everywhere to suggest
Mayan temples.
Astonishing and even beautiful things are in the show. Highly carved
figurines from Jaina, the island necropolis, have jointed limbs and
detachable shields for the warriors, like Action Man dolls, as well as
figures such as old women and hunchbacks who have much to tell
archaeologists about Mayan society. Here is the show to discover the Mayans'
incredible skill at using primitive means to carve obsidian and jade.
The catalogue, clear and readable, will give you the latest from the bloody
Mayan battlefield, whether the hieroglyphs really can be read (yes is the
answer). My world is the richer for learning that jade comes from Spanish
for 'stone of the kidneys', ijada, because the conquerors followed Mexican
practice in taking powdered jade as a medicine. No doubt that was the fate
of many fabulously carved necklaces such as stout Cortes gave his marquesa
on their betrothal. See also the very fine pre-Columbian rooms at the
Cinquantenaire museum which reopened last week after four years.
A smaller exhibition I liked is Crucible of Hope at the BBL headquarters,
place Royal 6. A survey of Mexican history from 1810 to 1910, it surveys a
century of revolution. The Belgian link is poignantly presented, less in the
person of Empress Charlotte who, I learnt, was an insanely ambitious woman
who forced poor Maximilian to accept the throne, than in the story of the
Belgian volunteers who left from Oudenaarde to defend their princess.
Ghent has a superb exhibition of silver, mostly religious, from New Spain in
the fine new galleries of the Museum vor Sierkunst; and shows elsewhere
explore popular art through masks, Day of the Dead paraphernalia, and the
muralists. For a Europalia catalogue, ring 071 629 0230.
