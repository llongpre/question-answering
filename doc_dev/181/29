Good manners can get in the way of good art. Demonstrating this are Carole 
Laventhol's new paintings, "The Gaia Series," on view at Mesa College Art 
Gallery. The series explores the female/male duality as both a sexual and a 
metaphysical opposition, but it does so too politely to bring forth anything 
particularly compelling or new. 
</P>
<P>
"Anima-Animus," of 1989, directly states Laventhol's concerns in its title, 
using terminology for female and male popularized by Carl Jung. It represents 
this polarity with two stone-like forms, one rounded and one rectilinear. Their 
physical relationship on the canvas can be described as touching, nudging or, 
maybe, penetrating. If the latter, the union is a cool and very discreet one. 
</P>
<P>
The same reticence restrains the 1987 painting, "Eidolon," and "Innerspace II" 
of 1988. These use contrasts of light and dark colors, smooth and rough 
surfaces, and compositions of paired forms to express the artist's idea of 
interacting opposites. This represents a very familiar game in abstract 
painting. In the comfort of this familiarity, novel expression and impact are 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of these geometric works are so aloof, however. In "Attracting Chaos" 
of 1988 an orb and a spiked ribbon shape generate a visual tension that 
appropriately suggests the excitation inherent in their apparently imminent 
union. It is noteworthy, though, how the title suggests the attitude of the 
artist concerning this prospect. The prediction of "chaos" in the title, with 
its implication of undesirable outcomes, raises a question of whether the 
artist is uncomfortable with certain aspects of what she's dealing with: that 
in the contrast between the erotic as a physical reality and the erotic as a 
metaphysical reality, she is at ease with the latter, but discomforted by the 
former. 
</P>
<P>
This resulting distancing from possibly impolite passions even has its 
equivalent in the artist's handling of materials. Her thick paints, and the raw 
edges of the large, unstretched canvases suggest an indulgence in sensuality. 
Yet the colors throughout are kept uniformly cool. This is not so unexpected in 
the blues, greens and earth tones that pervade the work, but seems peculiar in 
the reds, which are warm at best, but never hot. 
</P>
<P>
On top of this, all the images are coated with a slick, clear glaze that acts 
like Saran Wrap. For the eye, this closes off contact with the physical stuff 
of paint and canvas the way a glove gets in the way of holding hands. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps recognizing what was happening in the paintings, the most recent works 
in the series, all produced this year, reveal Laventhol incorporating figures, 
primarily female ones, into her imagery. In "Venus," she reproduces the 
30,000-year-old "Venus of Willendorf." This tiny statuette of a very robust 
female was created deep in the past, where one imagines that primal forces 
operated much more directly on human life than they do today. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of this knowledge, the image, in Laventhol's painting, fairly 
clobbers one over the head as a symbol of femaleness both literal and primal. 
Laventhol presents this ancient Venus as a giantess placed in front of a series 
of archways that closely quote another source: a painting by the Italian 
surrealist De Chirico. It is not difficult to ascribe male attributes to the 
architectural elements of Laventhol's painting and then to contrast these with 
the complementary aspects trumpeted by the female figure. But nothing comes of 
this because the maleness and femaleness don't meet. They're separated by a 
rigid screen of color and surface effects that locks each into quite disparate 
spaces. So much for the spice of life. 
</P>
<P>
A similar isolation of elements occurs in "Discomposed Woman," in which a nude, 
richly rounded female appears merged into a slab of pale stone. Above the slab 
is a smaller, blue, stone form next to which are the head and shoulder of a 
shadowy figure that may or may not be male. Surprising here is the way the head 
of the female is cropped off by her fit into the stone slab. Feminists 
generally find such treatment offensive and sexist for emphasizing women as 
objects at the cost of their full humanity. 
</P>
<P>
To the extent that this is the issue Laventhol is focusing on, it represents a 
retreat from her broader concerns in favor of the more specific territory of 
real interactions between real people. As an illustration of sexist attitudes 
and consequences, the painting is effective but leaves one wondering where the 
artist's passions are in all of this. 
</P>
<P>
The one work that goes beyond this limitation is "God's a Woman." Here, a nude 
female sits on the bottom of the painting's edge, facing into the space of the 
scene, where she confronts a dark shadow image of herself. This black shape 
appears joined to a massive crucifix that looms across the format on a bold 
diagonal. Beyond this, a dim face emerges from the painting's gray background. 
However, this face seems superfluous because the interaction of the fleshy and 
shadowy figures and the weighty cross possess so much more drama. Here one sees 
a self directly confronting itself, both physically and spiritually. 
</P>
<P>
The image is private and universal simultaneously. In it, Laventhol brushes 
aside simplistic politeness and seems personally invested for the first and 
only time in this exhibition. The return on her investment is a compelling work 
that begins to fully enter the domains that she otherwise only scratches the 
surface of in the "Gaia Series." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition continues through June 16 at Mesa College Art Gallery, which has 
done commendable work in organizing the show and publishing a 42-page 
illustrated catalogue that thoughtfully surveys this San Diego artist's past 
and current work.
