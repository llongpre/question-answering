What happens when an Aztec god who has lost his powers wakes up on a Los 
Angeles street and nobody recognizes him? For one thing, you get an allegorical 
sendup of Latino culture that unfolds at times with brilliant parodistic 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
The central premise of Roy Conboy's "Buscando America/Seeking America," which 
opened Thursday at Rancho Santiago College, couldn't be more pointed in its 
intention to satirize not only the shallowness of contemporary values but also 
the god's inflated vanity and injured pride. 
</P>
<P>
The play does this by exploiting the screwball misunderstandings engendered in 
the basic situation -- which is not unlike the landing of a dumbfounded Martian 
-- multiplying them from one scene to the next with a lowly taco vendor, a pair 
of star-struck Hollywood tourists, a macho drug dealer and his girlfriends, a 
rich woman unsatisfied by her wealth and an imperious magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
The funniest scene by far depicts the god Quetzalcoatl's confrontation with 
Carlos the drug dealer, a strutting vato who worships money, women and his 
immaculately polished, "chariot de oro" pickup truck -- not necessarily in that 
order. The humor is greatest here because it cuts closest to the bone (with no 
small thanks to Eddie Rivera's exaggerated performance as Carlos). 
</P>
<P>
But as enlightenment begins to dawn on Quetzalcoatl, whose quest to regain his 
former powers provides the play with its satirical thrust, it becomes all too 
apparent that "Buscando America" is trying for pathos as well as bitng social 
commentary. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Conboy is much less successful at engaging our pity than our 
laughter -- mainly because the writing loses its tension and the tone becomes 
self-indulgent when it takes aim at the tragic dimensions of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mythic legend at the heart of the play -- Quetzalcoatl's conflict 
with his brother god Tezcatlipoca -- is established in absurdist terms as an 
Orwellian thriller replete with Big Brotherish video newscasts and 
pistol-toting assassins in trench coats and aviator sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is played against the vivid backdrop of a huge billboard depicting 
a black cityscape silhouetted by a bright, yellow sky and big, bouncy letters 
proclaiming: "Hello from Los Angeles." On either side of the billboard are two 
painted skeletons. The stage floor bears the death's-head emblem of an enormous 
white skull. The blend -- while inventive and visually rich -- just does not 
lends itself to pathos. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, in the meantime, shows the intense enthusiasm of amateurs imbued with 
belief, if not always with polish. As Quetzalcoatl, Michael San Roman brings 
great comic warmth to his performance. Laurie Woolery, who plays Tezcatlipoca 
in various guises -- including the taco vendor, a bus driver, and a corrupt 
major domo -- has a certain furious presence. 
</P>
<P>
Like Woolery, the other cast members also play multiple roles. Rivera stands 
out, though, with his pricelessly overdone strut as the drug dealer. Also 
notable is Jo Bond's gavel-pounding magistrate, a cartoonish figure who 
purposely can't pronounce Quetzalcoatl's name. 
</P>
<P>
As the playwright, Conboy could have used more help than he has received to 
date at the various workshops where the script has been developed. The script 
still needs to be trimmed of unnecessary repetitions as well as confusing 
inconsistencies. But he clearly has a work-in-progress worth refining. As the 
director, Conboy cannot be faulted. His staging is sharp and highly theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it ought to be said that this production of "Buscando America" 
represents something of a triumph as the maiden outing for the new 
multicultural troupe Cucucuevez, especially given its minimal financial 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
