<LEADPARA>  A revolution has taken place without most of us being aware of it. The results
of the revolution will be on display at this weekend's Cinco de Mayo
celebration in downtown San Jose.;    Most of us know that in the first half
of the 19th century, Mexicans ruled California before the Anglos came and, in
1848, forever changed the good life that the Mexican Californianos had here in
Santa Clara County.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     We know that these Californianos owned huge ranchos but that they lost
their land, political influence and cultural dominance in the years following
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo when California was ceded to the United
States.;    In the last half of the 20th century, descendants of the
Californianos are coming back to assert their influence in current affairs
once again.;    As for la revolucion, Mexican people have a long history of
fighting for their independence. Cinco de Mayo itself is the commemoration of
their victory over Maximilian's French troops in 1862 at the Battle of
Puebla.;    That noisy revolution even made headlines in the United States.
But the quiet revolution of the past few years in California has barely caused
one head to turn.;    It had its beginnings in the 1960s, when
culture-consciousness was being raised throughout the United States. Part of
this was a new self-awareness of the contributions of Mexican-Americans in
California and the Southwest. As a number of Mexican-American leaders emerged
to exert influence in social, economic and political arenas, a resurgence of
interest in their culture -- the arts, crafts, music and dance -- grew among
other segments of the population.;    As in most revolutions the seeds were
sown many years before the fruit was harvested. Almost imperceptibly, our
colleges began to move away from strict adherence to the Euro-American
philosophies of art and to become more sensitive and aware of the validity of
art from other cultures.;    Young artists fostered;  As these new areas of
programming were explored, faculties collaborated with such unsung heroes as
San Jose Art Museum curators Albert Dickson and Marty Manson, to develop and
showcase young artists.;    George Rivera, curator of the Triton Museum in
Santa Clara, gives much credit to San Jose State University and the community
colleges in the area. Rivera was an art student at SJS in 1975 when he felt
his school was "the hub of all the energy in the area.";    A number of
non-profit galleries emerged about that time such as the San Jose Art League,
San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art and the Works Gallery. All continue
today to provide the most diverse forums possible. Each gallery holds
receptions, lectures and gallery exhibits -- taking chances on newly
developing talent.;    In the forefront of addressing today's need for
cultural pluralism, professor John Porter and instructor Sylvia Rios have
pushed an outreach program for the art department of Gavilan College in
Gilroy. Also, Euphrat Gallery in Cupertino's De Anza College has developed a
broad program for showcasing minority artists through the efforts of its
curator, Jan Rindfleisch.;    Artistic backers have a role;    Among those
taking individual responsibility for promoting the quiet revolution are local
artists, Erin Goodwin Guerrero and Consuelo Underwood, and San Juan Bautista
painter Eduardo Ramos. Al Preciado, and other members of the San Jose Fine
Arts Commission, have also extended a helping hand to struggling Hispanic
student artists.;    The San Jose chapter of the G.I. Forum has long worked to
provide exposure for Mexican-American art and has sponsored an exhibition
during the Cinco de Mayo celebration for several years.;    The tangible
results of the ongoing revolution in Chicano creativity will be on display at
the San Jose Convention and Cultural Facility at Park and Market streets from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Folk dancing will begin at noon as an added
attraction.;    The exhibition is free to the public under the joint
sponsorship of the G.I. Forum, the city of San Jose and its fine arts
commission.;    A list of the exhibitors for the art show includes San Josean
Pablo Soto and Los Gatan Hugo Lecaros. Maria Ortiz's Barrio Art Gallery will
display the work of fledgling artists age 13 to 18. Mary Andrade's sensitive
and perceptive photographs will also be shown.;    The crafts section will
feature the Maria Rodriguez handmade Mexican dolls in traditional costume, and
Luz Elena Limas will demonstrate her skill in creating handmade pinatas.;   
Joining the ranks of persistent fighters in the quiet revolution is Martin
Hernandez, gradually gaining recognition as a sculptor/potter. The San Joaquin
valley native was born 44 years ago into a migrant farm worker's family. He
grew up in the Tropicana Village subdivision of East San Jose. After working
his way through SJS, he graduated with a master's degree in art.;    Hernandez
calls himself "a hybrid American: part Mayan, part Papago Indian," and admits
it took him 30 years before he called himself an artist. He works part-time at
the Children's Discovery Museum and finally has been able to get his own
studio. His Blue Ribbon pieces that combine "mysticism and magical realism"
are strongly influenced by Mayan and Aztec themes.;    Hernandez is proud to
be the first Chicano artist in the area to have an original work on permanent
public display. His eight-foot sculpted wall was purchased by the Children's
Discovery Museum.;    Exhibitor Ramon Brusuelas, a former cabinet maker, found
his niche after an early retirement. Brusuelas, who, in the 1930s, went to
school barefoot in his native village of Tularosa, N.M., has a bachelor of
arts degree in industrial arts from San Francisco State University. He is a
teaching assistant in wood and ceramics.;    Hernandez, Brusuelas and their
peers, as effective combatants in re-establishing the intrinsic value of their
culture, are proving to be good role models for the next generation of artists.  </TEXT>
