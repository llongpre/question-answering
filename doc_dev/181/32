January may signal the beginning of a fresh, untried year -- and in the present 
case, a new decade -- but in the art world, it is a month like any other. More 
auspicious on the art world's calendar is September, when the new "season" of 
shows begins and galleries settle down to business again after the summer lull. 
Allegiance to an academic calendar that begins in the fall and ends with spring 
is steadfast among New York galleries, whose clients retreat from the sweating 
city during July and August. 
</P>
<P>
The same pattern holds in San Diego, though the population here swells in the 
summer. Galleries hang the traditional summer group shows, university and 
college spaces shut down, and museums often schedule their most broadly 
appealing shows. 
</P>
<P>
However nondescript a month for those in the art biz, January is here, now, and 
it has brought with it the rooted ritual of surveying the year ahead. The view, 
of one exhibition season half-completed and the next barely planned, is 
splintered, but telling. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego galleries and museums have on their books for 1990 a globe-trotting 
schedule that glimpses at the art of Indonesia, Poland, the Soviet Union, 
Mexico and England. Good neighbors to our area artists, they also keep one foot 
on local soil, anchoring the visionary with the responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Several voids will begin to be filled in the coming year. Two shows featuring 
contemporary African-American artists ought to restore at least a temporary 
sense of egalitarianism to the local scene. One, focusing on printmakers 
nationwide, opens Saturday at the Lyceum theatre, and was organized by the 
embryonic African-American Museum of Fine Arts. The other, at Grossmont College 
(Feb. 1-23), includes local and Los Angeles artists working in a variety of 
media. 
</P>
<P>
The void left by last year's closing of Installation, the downtown alternative 
space, is also expected to be filled this year. The gallery's board of 
directors is currently running the organization out of one board member's home, 
but they have begun the search for a new director and anticipate getting back 
on track by the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
ARTWALK, the downtown art community's annual open house, coordinated by 
Installation, will take place April 21-22. Other holes in the fabric of the 
local art community may be left gaping this year. The large gallery space at 
9th and G, recently vacated by Dietrich Jenny and, before him, Mark Quint, 
awaits another brave soul willing to risk a fragile future as a contemporary 
art dealer for the sake of helping to keep downtown's art scene alive. 
</P>
<P>
New voids will also be created in 1990, as the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art closes its downtown space (this weekend) and maybe part of its La Jolla 
facility in the fall while it undergoes a major expansion. The museum is 
scouting about town for a temporary exhibition space -- or several -- in which 
to continue its programs until the expansion is completed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
What else to expect in 1990? 
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Centro Cultural de la Raza, which 
will be publishing a book assessing its present and future endeavors. The 
gallery also plans a rich schedule of shows, from the annual eye-opening 
"Border Realities" installation by the Border Art Workshop, to a string of 
one-person and group shows featuring Native American artists, Chicano artists 
living in the Southwest and muralists from Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Ambitious global grazing on the part of local gallery directors will yield a 
promising array of shows this year. Mark Quint Contemporary Art will feature 
work by the Polish painter and photographer Mikolaj Smoczynski as well as the 
wry assemblages of British sculptor Richard Wentworth. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet artists return to the local limelight at the David Zapf Gallery, which 
featured (along with the Mesa College Art Gallery) an engaging selection of 
paintings by Leningrad artists during last year's festival. More paintings by 
members of the Fellowship for Experimental Art will be seen at the gallery this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
German sculptor Franz Erhard Walther will present his brand of Minimalism in a 
series of abstract, dyed fabric works at the San Diego State University Art 
Gallery beginning February 9. Sculptures, murals, drawings and exuberant 
reliefs by the Basque artist Andres Nagel will be on view at the Tasende 
Gallery the following month. 
</P>
<P>
The Iturralde Gallery narrows its Latin American focus to concentrate on a 
handful of Mexican artists this year, while the Mingei International Museum of 
World Folk Art extends its gaze southward to present "Mayan Threads," a show of 
textile treasures from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Local artists Manny Farber, Faiya Fredman, Graciela Ovejero, Reesey Shaw, David 
Baze, Nancy Kittredge, Roy David Rogers and others will add solo shows to their 
resumes this year, and ten as-yet-undisclosed locals will also be included in 
"Satellite Intelligence: Boston/San Diego New Art Exchange," this summer at the 
La Jolla Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Double-takes and murmurs will, as always, greet Sushi's StreetSites projects 
this year. In March, the performance and visual art gallery will plant three 
temporary public art works downtown to engage the community in dialogue on such 
issues as local growth and development, homelessness and censorship of the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
Also bound to raise a few eyebrows is photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's "X" 
portfolio, to be shown at PhotoWest Gallery this spring. Homoerotic and 
sadomasochistic images from the series were at the heart of the recent 
congressional debate over government funding of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Two dwellings will be temporarily constructed in town this year -- one a 
shelter for the body, the other a refuge for the spirit. The San Diego Museum 
of Art presents "In the Realm of Ideas" this summer, featuring the work of 
architect Frank Lloyd Wright. As part of the exhibition, a full-scale "Usonian 
Automatic House," Wright's proposed solution to the need for moderate, 
custom-built housing, will be erected in the parking lot in front of the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
On a more intimate scale, Los Angeles artist Mineko Grimmer will create a 
site-specific installation for the Mesa College Art Gallery in May. Grimmer's 
organic sculptures pay homage to the musical theories of John Cage as well as 
to the Japanese reverence for the integrity, meditative potential and 
metaphoric possibilities of stone. Perhaps the most subtle of the year's 
offerings, Grimmer's work will seal the current season of shows and usher in 
the calm interlude before the next begins.
