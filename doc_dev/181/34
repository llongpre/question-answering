   Columbia University is opening the first public gallery in New
York devoted exclusively to architecture.
   The gallery space in Buell Hall, which was constructed in 1876,
consists of 4,100 square feet. The building also houses the School
of Architecture.
   The first exhibition in the new gallery opens April 4 and runs
through May 11. ``The Filter of Reason: Work of Paul Nelson,''
focuses on the work of the American architect, movie set designer,
painter and critic who taught and practiced architecture in the
United States and France for more than 50 years.
   Nelson helped develop functionalism in the 1930s and '40s, a
movement that rejected beaux-arts traditionalism.
   Elsewhere, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum has received an
unrestricted gift of $5 million from Akira Tobishima, president and
chief executive officer of Tobishima Corp., an international
engineering and construction company based in Tokyo.
