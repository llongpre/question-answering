   Masterworks in the permanent collection at the Museum of Fine
Arts in Houston are featured in the institution's first full-color
publication, ``A Permanent Legacy.''
   Published by Hudson Hills books, the 352-page work presents 150
full-page colorplates of works by the world's greatest artists,
including Renoir, Degas, van Gogh, Picasso, O'Keeffe, Matisse,
Sargent, Cezanne and Cassatt.
   ``During the 1980s, the museum has expanded to serve the varied
and complex demands of a major cosmopolitan city,'' said Peter C.
Marzio, the museum's director. ``As the museum has become a
cultural hub for the community, the need to document and celebrate
the collection has become apparent.''
   The museum's permanent collection contains more than 24,000
works of the Renaissance, English and early American decorative
arts, late 19th and 20th century European and American art and
photography. There is also Near and Far Eastern art, tribal arts
and ancient and early European art.
   Here is a list of shows and exhibits at some of the nation's
