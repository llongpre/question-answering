It was hot and sticky Saturday at the Cinco de Mayo celebration sponsored by 
the College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, perfect weather for a nice cold 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
But Jered Standing was having trouble with the soda his mother had just bought 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can drink with this thing," complained the 10-year-old boy, 
referring to the still-wet plaster-of-Paris Mexican mask that a folk artist had 
just created for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Aaaah!" Standing said when artist Lonnie Miramontes gently pulled it off his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
All day long, children lined up to have their faces wrapped in gooey gauze. 
</P>
<P>
And when the masks dried, they sat under a shade tree to paint them with 
brilliant colors. 
</P>
<P>
Miramontes said he hoped to share a little of Mexican culture with the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that was one of the principal aims of the organizers of the Cinco de 
Mayo festival, which was held to celebrate the college's 20th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really making an effort to bring these two cultures together," said Sue 
Bozman, the college's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Another purpose was to encourage Latinos to become familiar with the college. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're really trying to do is outreach for the Mexican community," Bozman 
said. "To let them know this is a place where they are welcome, where they can 
have fun and learn." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers estimated that 1,000 people would attend the daylong celebration 
that included plenty of music, salsa, folk dancing and dramatic skits. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were 200 migrant farm worker families. 
</P>
<P>
It was clearly a day for children, who scampered from one event to another. 
</P>
<P>
They made miniature pinatas out of paper bags and crepe paper, and shaped bowls 
and vases from big mounds of clay. 
</P>
<P>
And once the full-size pinatas appeared, the children all seemed to gravitate 
toward the grassy clearing where the real action was. 
</P>
<P>
When a boy bashed the head off a blue Cookie Monster pinata, bedlam broke out 
as children scoured the grass for candy. 
</P>
<P>
A new "musical sculpture," made by the college's welding students, was a big 
hit with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
When a child hit the large metal sculpture with a rod, it sounded like the 
tinkling chimes in a bell tower. 
</P>
<P>
Some adults preferred to escape the heat by slipping into an air-conditioned 
building to look at an exhibit of 40 paintings by Mexican artists, sponsored by 
the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
Still others crowded around the messy soda booth where frantic volunteers were 
unable to keep up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
But Angee Harrold, 21, another college student, said, "It's so hot out here I 
can't stand it."
