In an epoch when polarization runs high and skins rub thin, the multi-ethnic 
Los Angeles Festival wants to nurture understanding between the diverse 
cultures on the Pacific Rim. Lurking behind this benign and healing impulse is 
the danger that the festival might fail to draw the right balance between 
ethnography and art. Too much of the one and the festival speaks only to the 
already initiated. Too little of the other and it disappoints an audience 
expecting entertainment or aesthetic delectation. 
</P>
<P>
The problem nags at the most prominent art exhibition associated with the 
festival. Titled "CARA" (an acronym for "Chicano Art: Resistance and 
Affirmation"), it opened Sunday at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery and runs to Dec. 9. 
As a measure of its ambition, it will travel to seven museums around the 
country and includes about 130 works by more than 90 artists, including many 
collaborative projects and suggesting the communal urge that inspired the 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, it is an exercise in cultural history, out to educate -- even 
indoctrinate -- its audience, first in the history and mores of a U.S. 
subculture. But, unlike the recent "The Latin American Spirit: Art and Artists 
in the United States," "CARA" tightens the focus first to Americans of Mexican 
descent, then to that faction among them who wish to be known as Chicanos and 
as part of the Chicano movement. An interpretive glossary to be included in the 
show's yet-undelivered catalogue, defines the movement as social, cultural, 
political and out to assert and regain the civil rights in a community where 
some feel they have been lost. It defines Chicano as a "self-designating term 
for politicized people of Mexican descent in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, some Mexican-Americans regard the term as a slur. According to the 
glossary virtually all terms for Latin-descended U.S. citizens from Spanish to 
Latino to Hispanic are offensive to somebody, proving there is no consensus on 
the subject. U.S. citizens who call themselves "Americans" are generally 
regarded as arrogant as the whole continent is America, north and south. 
Chicanos embrace their handle as a symbol of identification with the poor and 
disenfranchised. 
</P>
<P>
The main essay by Shifra Goldman and Tomas Ybarra-Frausto says the movement is 
centered in the Southwest. The geography is known to Chicanos as Aztlan and 
regarded as the ancestral home of the Aztecs. During the heyday of the 
movement, some Chicanos held it was plunder lost to the Anglos in the 
Mexican-American War and they wanted it back. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition traces the movement from 1965 to 1985. The essay reviews it from 
Cesar Chavez's organization of the United Farm Workers in the '60s to its 
tragic apogee in East Los Angeles during a huge 1970 anti-Vietnam War 
demonstration when newsman Ruben Salazar was killed by a tear-gas canister 
fired by a sheriff's deputy. It moves on to such cultural matters as the 
representation of Latinos in feature films like Gregory and Anna Nava's classic 
"El Norte." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of this is informative if sometimes myopically biased but it does create 
a problem that is shared by the increasingly large numbers of exhibitions that 
want to link fine art to social and political issues. There is always a 
traumatic disjuncture between the intellectual and generalizing mind-set of the 
social historian and the intensely personal and specific operation of the 
artist. Even when the artist consciously shares the intellectual's goals, his 
creative product and its scholarly rationale repel each another like magnets 
turned the wrong way. They represent irreconcilable modes of human expression. 
Art is about organic feeling which is reduced to cold ideology by advocacy 
scholarship. The Chicano art movement is not well-known to the general culture. 
In L.A. we have seen such occasional museum exhibitions as the County Museum of 
Art's "Los Four" in 1974 and commercial gallery shows that have created 
individual reputations for such artists as the late Carlos Almaraz, Gronk and 
John Valadez, among others. "CARA" creates the impression that Chicano art was 
less an organized movement than a spontaneous expression. 
</P>
<P>
Spontaneity is hard to define but very convincing, as when somebody suddenly 
slugs you. That is what the real art in "CARA" does and it's a big relief after 
all the polemic. The art also bursts unexpectedly into song or plants a big 
kiss on your kisser. You feel like you've been invited into the barrio to share 
the artists' most tender and angry feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The trademark form of Chicano art is its powerful, raw murals, like the noted 
works of L.A.'s Judith Baca. They speak most clearly of a subculture struggling 
for internal cohesion and individual identity. Since murals can't be brought 
into an art gallery, they are represented, diluted, in a slide show. Other 
installations remained unfinished as vernissage festivities approached on 
Sunday, but the spirit was there. 
</P>
<P>
The very first image encountered in the galleries is a woodcut by Carlos Cortez 
Koyokuikatl, a portrait including the phrase, "Art for art's sake is an 
absurdity." About three-quarters of the work echoes that sentiment. It's out to 
be forceful, idealistic, heartfelt and funny rather than perfect. You want 
generosity? Look at Amalia Mesa-Bains' "An Ofrenda for Dolores del Rio." There 
are works echoing the artists' admiration for Mexican Surrealist Frida Kahlo 
but only one of them -- by Yreina D. Cervantes -- approaches the quality of 
Kahlo's art. Admiring memories of the great Mexican revolutionary muralists, 
Rivera, Siqueiros and Orozco, are everywhere with a dollop of Posada and a 
whiff of Tamayo thrown in. Yet none of the Chicano artists display the masters' 
command of materials, heroic scale or symbolic savvy. 
</P>
<P>
The style of what we see here is that of neighborhood art. Even markedly 
professional artists like Luis Jimenez retain an aura of home-grown funk. 
Rather than taking that immediately as a shortcoming, let's look at it as a 
diagnostic symptom. It's really not unlike what we've seen coming out from the 
now-liberated Soviet underground. It's art made to express intimate feelings to 
be shared with friends and family without consideration of a larger audience. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a shame to change the candor of Carmen Lomas Garza. Her gentle 
poetry is already complete in "Camas Para Suenos" where we see mother making 
the beds while the kids lounge on the roof dreaming at the moon. Gilbert 
Lujan's Pachuco dogs and Aztec-jaguar lowriders have already been ripped off as 
boutique knickknacks, proving he can't afford to get much slicker. 
</P>
<P>
"CARA" shows a complete sensibility. It's socially concerned, inbred, romantic, 
proud, nostalgic, ceremonial, masochistic, fetishistic and original. Where 
would the Anglos have been for fashion after World War II without the zoot 
suit? 
</P>
<P>
Any art judged by sensibility is of interest just as all people are of 
interest. "CARA's" collective look becomes a simile of a stay-with-the-gang 
subculture. That works among the home folks but in a larger world, it's 
different -- as proven by the growth of numerous artists here. Now they are in 
the Wight Gallery, which once housed a retrospective of Henri Matisse. That 
raises the ante just as society does when Junior moves out and has to please an 
objective boss, not just his mom and buddies. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful single body of work here are the photographs. Maybe that's 
because a demand for technical savvy is built into the medium. Ricardo 
Valverde's "Boulevard Night" doesn't lose an ounce of eloquence from being well 
composed and printed. Technique enhances the dark glamour of a barrio street 
cruise and a girl with Egyptian eyes. Photos are also ideally suited to 
exhibitions with a sociological bias, as witness the work of Harry Gamboa Jr., 
Adam Avila and others. 
</P>
<P>
Graphic art looks strong because it's learnable and a natural medium for 
propaganda. Rupert Garcia's red barbed-wire image " Cesen Deportacion!" is as 
good as any prime Cuban revolutionary poster, but his striking image of Zapata 
falls apart. It's a drawing problem around the jaw line and that's odd because 
a lot of the more cartoony work shows immense natural facility. 
</P>
<P>
To paraphrase the moribund comedian, "Dying is easy, painting is hard." More 
paintings are blown among "CARA" works than in any other medium. Daniel 
Galvez's dogged, hyperreal "Homegirl" is a triumph of expression over art. The 
tough lady stands there in her T-shirt and the image is so present it nails us 
to the wall. But no thanks to Galvez's worriful paint handling. Baca has 
similar problems in "The Three Marias." When you have to agonize too much it 
hurts the work. 
</P>
<P>
"CARA's" art rarely shows Chicano artists at their best. The exhibition proves 
that combining art and sociology is still a dicey business requiring more skill 
than was shown here. More importantly, "CARA" proves that the issue of quality 
in art will not go away. Some commentators are insisting these days that 
quality is a code word for the judgmental domination of white males. Nonsense. 
That's not what the word means. Quality has to do with every person's desire to 
get better, to express themselves with greater eloquence, force and finesse. 
The best artist in "CARA" wants to do that. So do I. So do you.
