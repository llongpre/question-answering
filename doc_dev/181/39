If the kids have been clamoring for a little kilaujatut, load 'em up in the 
family komatik and head for "Igloos of Fun," the Irvine Fine Arts Center ninth 
annual Youth Art Day. But you had better leave the aiverk at home. 
</P>
<P>
If by chance you don't speak Inutitut, the language of the Inuit Eskimo, those 
exotic-sounding words mean, respectively, drum dancing, sled and walrus -- not 
exactly part of the average county schoolchild's vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, the Inuit come to Irvine. Well, sort of. From 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m., children ages 3 to 10 can sample the lighter side of life among these 
hardy "people of the snow" in a day of art workshops, entertainment and games 
on the center's grounds in Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
The children's festival coincides with four Eskimo-themed exhibits on display 
at the center through April 28. They are "Inuit Games: Traditional Sport and 
Play of the Eskimo," a collection of stone-cut prints and soapstone sculpture 
by Eskimo artists that depict games of skill and endurance; artifacts of the 
Bering Sea Eskimos from Bowers Museum's permanent collection, and "The 
Grandparents of My Gloves," a retrospective by Berkeley dancer Patricia Bulitt, 
which features costumes, recordings and mixed-media remembrances of Bulitt's 
10-year cultural exchange with Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
Bulitt recently shared her experiences with teachers from the Irvine Unified 
School District. District teachers passed on the lesson to their students, who 
interpreted their studies in a series of drawings, poetry and clay sculptures 
displayed at the center's gallery. (A drawing by Culverdale School student Mike 
Jazayeri sums up the children's cross-cultural experience with a decidedly 
California flair: The Alaskan god of summer, a six-armed figure, wears 
sunglasses and clutches a hot dog, an ice cream cone and a Beach Boys album.) 
</P>
<P>
Docent tours of the exhibits will be offered through the day. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's festivities center on seven, hourlong art workshops and several 
Eskimo games that will introduce children to the culture, said Jill Stute, the 
center's special events coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"The Inuit used games as a means of developing strength and manual dexterity," 
Stute said. "Theirs was a harsh way of life, and some of their games were very 
physically taxing. The kids can see those tougher games in the exhibit, and on 
the day of the festival they'll get hands-on experience with games like Eskimo 
yo-yos and bean-bag juggling." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stute said, Dori Kirk Fitzgerald, the center's curator of 
exhibitions, will lead children in an authentic Eskimo hunting dance taught to 
her by Bullitt, and storytellers will share traditional tales of the Eskimo. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's balmy weather is a far cry from the Eskimo's chilly climate, so a snow 
machine will provide a frosting of real snow on the center's lawn. The snow 
will fall at 11 a.m. Depending on the weather, it should last about an hour, 
Stute said. 
</P>
<P>
Art workshops will begin at 10 a.m. In "Magical Masks," children 6 and older 
will create masks based on Arctic animals. "Snow Prints" introduces youngsters 
to a variation on Eskimo-style block printing. In "Charms and Spells," children 
will learn how good-luck charms and magic spells helped the Eskimo succeed in 
the hunt, then create their own charms in clay. 
</P>
<P>
"Arctic Antics" is a collaborative project in which small groups will create 
clay scenes of Eskimo life, which will be fired and later displayed in the 
center's gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Go Fish" will be geared for children ages 3 to 5. In it, children will learn 
about fish as a staple in the Eskimo diet, then design and decorate their own 
fish from a grab bag of art materials. In the "Drawing and Painting 
Expedition," children will hear tales of the Eskimo hunt, then depict their 
impressions in mixed media. "It's Snowing" will let young artists create snow 
by drawing Arctic scenes, then applying a solution of epsom salts that form 
snowlike crystals on the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Two drop-in workshops -- "Arctic Mural," in which youngsters will contrast 
their life style with the Eskimo's on two large murals, and "Build Your Own 
Igloo," a construction project of fair-weather igloos of cardboard and paint -- 
will be offered throughout the day. Face-painting will also be available for a 
small fee. 
</P>
<P>
In the center's courtyard, such local entertainers as the Lori Hansen Dancers, 
the Rainbow Singers and Sky Badger, an American Indian who tells folk stories, 
will be presented. Food will be sold from 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth Art day will be Saturday at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, 14321 Yale Ave. 
in Irvine's Heritage Park. Attendance is open to the entire family. Children 
under 6 must be accompanied by an adult. Walk-in registration will begin at 9 
a.m. Registration fee is $9 per child and includes two 1-hour workshops, both 
drop-in workshops and all entertainment and games. Adults are free.
