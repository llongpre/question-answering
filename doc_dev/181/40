TIM HAWKINSON -- MANIPULATING EVERYDAY OBJECTS AND NOTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
An American penny becomes a cobra snake with a long thin mass of copper 
stretched between the coin's "head" and "tail"; a nurse's cap becomes a 
mother's breast complete with a nipple sculpted from human hair; a crucifix 
becomes an old-fashioned scale, with the weights consisting of two bags of gold 
resembling figures in mourning; and an American flag becomes a literal 
black-and-white, stars-and-stripes image with the stars coming from a 
photograph of the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the works of mixed-media artist Tim Hawkinson, who manipulates 
everyday objects and the notions we hold about them to create a diverse body of 
artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the work comes from an investigation of social and personal views of 
the objects," said Hawkinson, who has a one-person show at Wilshire Boulevard's 
Ace Gallery through Saturday, and will be included in a three-person show 
opening at Santa Monica's Michael Kohn Gallery on Thursday (through Aug. 25). 
"There's just this kind of general urge to corrupt everyday objects that we 
find." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkinson, 29, works in a variety of mediums and says that he has no special 
trick to coming up with the diverse ideas. "I just use whatever medium is most 
suited to the ideas, but the ideas always come first" the soft-spoken, clean 
cut Hawkinson said, noting that he must sometimes "invent" objects to use as 
materials for his pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Hawkinson's pieces are romantic, such as a manipulated lunar calendar 
made of a 10-foot-long pearl necklace. Some refer directly to already existing 
artworks, such as the copy of Simone Martini's famous "Annunciation" painting 
that Hawkinson put onto an envelope so that the cancellation stamps became 
halos around the deities' heads. 
</P>
<P>
And still others are based on his own body. Three recent "self portraits," for 
instance, include a photographic collage of "the area I can not see in the 
periphery of my body," a cast lead sculpture of "the maximum mass I could get 
into my mouth," and a sculpture of the artist's legs where "the height of the 
sculpture was determined by (the amount of lead needed to equal) my body 
weight." 
</P>
<P>
But most of Hawkinson's pieces stand on their own, unrelated to other work he 
has done. An example seem during a recent trip to the artist's downtown studio 
-- which he shares with his painter wife Patty Wickman -- was a rather pretty 
rose window composed of medical slides from the pap smears of 300 women. The 
piece, Hawkinson explained, shows "the relationship of the (pap smears) to the 
history of the church and religion: There are two ways of seeing things, 
through the window and through the microscope." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkinson, who normally works on a number of pieces at one time, says he likes 
to keep variety in his work, which has "remained consistently inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
"I've avoided the idea of working in any kind of a series format," he says, 
noting that the variety helps him avoid falling into a formula and keeps his 
work more honest. "I'm much more interested in the ideas themselves."

THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
Melrose Avenue's Cure Gallery is making its own contribution to the debate over 
"obscene" artworks and National Endowment for the Arts funding. Included in the 
gallery's current three-man show, called "Collaborative Views," is South 
Pasadena-based artist Theodore's 72-by-48-inch texturized acrylic painting 
depicting a large, erect penis. The work's title: "What Does Jesse (Helms) 
Want?" Also included in the show is Studio City-based artist Steve Montiglio's 
oil painting, "Helms Deep," which features two intermingled nude females.

"For the first two weeks of September, cancel everything; just drop it now!" 
began L.A. Festival director Peter Sellars as he addressed an enthusiastic 
crowd of more than 100 members of the Fellows of Contemporary Art at its recent 
new members party. 
</P>
<P>
While Sellars' Pacific-themed festival doesn't officially begin until Sept. 1, 
the first two of the more than 25 visual art exhibitions included under its 
banner open this week. "Images of Faith: Religious Ivory Carvings From the 
Philippines" opens at Pacific Asia Museum today, and "Tongues of Flame," the 
first comprehensive exhibition of works by controversial New York artist David 
Wojnarowicz, goes on view Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Three emerging L.A. artists are hoping to make a go of it with a new art space 
opening up today in the downtown Santa Fe Artists Colony. Alan Blizzard, 
Richard Gerrish and Heidi Von Kann have joined together to form Millenium, 
which they have committed to run for one year and would like to open up to both 
visual and performance artists if adequate financial support can be found. 
</P>
<P>
As its first event, Millenium (at 2401 S. Santa Fe Ave., Studio 22) is holding 
a special $100-per-couple opening today from 2-5 p.m. to benefit the charity 
Vital Options. RSVP: (213) 587-5902.

OVERHEARD

"I probably have stuff around my house that would fit in this room," said a 
middle-aged woman in a black-and-green pantsuit as she glanced at the 
"funny-looking teapot" and other works in the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art's 20th-Century Ceramics room during one of the museum's special 25th 
Anniversary Member's Evenings.
