When Los Angeles artist Francesco Siqueiros visited colleagues in Mexico City, 
he discovered something exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taken by their group projects and by the discussions they held every 
week," Siqueiros says. "It was stimulating talking about art issues." 
</P>
<P>
He was so moved by their group sharing and cooperation that he wanted to tell 
the world about it. Or at least Southern California. "How could I bring these 
artists to Los Angeles?" he asked himself. 
</P>
<P>
Siqueiros pictured the two art communities meeting each other and opening the 
lines of communication through an exhibition and art workshop. He proposed the 
idea to Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in 1988 but he says he "got a lot 
of bureaucratic run-around from them. They didn't know what to do with this 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more than putting together a show just for viewing. I wanted something 
with the intellectual friction and historical tension that exists between the 
two countries," Siqueiros says. 
</P>
<P>
Mentioning his idea to friends at a party, Siqueiros was told to go to Edward 
Leffingwell, then the new director at Barnsdall's Municipal Art Gallery in 
Hollywood. Leffingwell, Siqueiros learned, had been exploring a similar idea. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was Siqueiros' vision of getting together onto the same stage Mexican 
as well as Mexican-American artists that won Leffingwell's interest. He 
extended the city's support through the auspices of the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department, with additional financing from the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
What Siqueiros and Leffingwell, along with co-curator Gabriela Cortines, have 
assembled is Aqui y Alla (translation: Here and Over There), an exhibition of 
contemporary works by Nahum Zenil, Diego Toledo, Eloy Tarcisio, Ruben Rosas, 
Mario Rangel Faz, Ruben Ortiz Torres, Monica Castillo of Mexico City and Victor 
Estrada, Yreina Cervantez, Anthony Zepeda, Margaret Garcia, John Valadez, Frank 
Romero and Patssi Valdez of Los Angeles. The exhibit will run through Nov. 4 at 
the Barnsdall Park Arts Center. In addition, the artists will meet this month 
and next in several panel discussions on contemporary Chicano art. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will also be shown in Tijuana and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Leffingwell promises that the exhibit "will be about ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Like those of Patssi Valdez of East L.A., a painter who now deals extensively 
with on-site installations. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to work with chance," she says. "Life is chance. We never know what's 
going to come in life." 
</P>
<P>
Chance is not an element of Yreina Cervantez's art. The daughter of farm 
workers, she paints images of her inner pain and conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"My work uses personal symbolism and cultural symbolism," the Los Angeles 
artist says, "but it gets back to identity, which is so important. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be open up to our experiences. We're all very different, but there 
are basic truths. Art manifests changes in the community. As artists, we have 
responsibilities. We are visionaries." 
</P>
<P>
Facing the past and placing it into perspective, as Cervantez has done on a 
personal level, is what the Chicano art movement is about, she says. 
</P>
<P>
However, Victor Estrada of Los Angeles warns against any temptation to 
categorize the Chicano art movement as solely political. To do so, he says, 
implies that Chicano artists cannot do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens to the ability to express one's self? The social issues are going 
to come out in the work anyway," he says defending his abstract style. "Some 
artists make their art specific, and in other's the issues just come out. 
</P>
<P>
"The more room there is for difference, the greater power art has. If you try 
to control culture, it's another form of facism. Artistically, people have to 
assume their right to exist. Freedom is not given, it's taken." 
</P>
<P>
But master printer Anthony Zepeda of Los Angeles says he could never be 
political with his work. 
</P>
<P>
"My art is more like poetry," he says. "It's the only way I know how to express 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Zepeda says he views the Aqui y Alla exhibition as an expression of ethnic and 
artistic pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in this particular show because I want my father to come see 
it," he says of his father who migrated to the United States in 1905 during the 
Mexican Revolution. "He's essentially more Mexican than me. I want him to be 
happy that it's happening."
