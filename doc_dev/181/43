<LEADPARA>  IT'S difficult to be a bohemian, free-spirit, artsy type at Christmas.;  
After all, you know that the true spirit of the season does not lie in the
exchange of gifts, but in the exchange of souls and hand-made batiks that you
should have started making in June if you were going to have enough for all of
the cousins.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That's right, you're going to hand out presents of the temporal kind this
year, even though it is disturbing to think of yourself as a mere consumer.
You could be making this world a more beautiful place. Instead, you'll be
standing in line at Target.;   But there is a compromise: the museum store,
those shops that not only have unusual, art-related gifts, but help support a
cultural institution. What a deal: you get great gifts and none of the guilt.;
  You also can combine shopping with pleasure if you give yourself enough time
to visit the galleries. However, museums will allow you to visit their stores
without paying the admission fees for the galleries if you tell the guards
you're just there for the shopping.;   Here's a guide to some of the best and
biggest museum shops:;   (star) San Jose Museum of Art Book &amp; Gift Shop, 110
S. Market St., San Jose. Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday; 10 a.m.-8 p.m.
Tuesday-Friday; 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturday; and noon-6 p.m. Sunday. through Dec.
23. (408) 294-2787. Sometimes it's difficult for San Jose to rise above
feelings of inferiority when it comes to our neighbor to the north. After all,
most of San Francisco's cultural institutions have a jump of several decades
on our own. However, when it comes to museum stores, San Jose bows to no one.;
  The shop, located in the older part of the museum and with its own entrance
on Market Street, is bustling. The museum shop has a nice selection of art
books, calendars, cards and jewelry, but its strength might be its birdhouses.
The store carries two kinds. The hand-carved bird abodes of Barry Leader are
bright and whimsical. There's even one fashioned like the head of a cat,
presumably for your less intelligent avian life. Prices range from $120 to
$140.;   For those with smaller budgets, there are the birdhouses of Fred Van
Anda. They're rustic, made from used wood and bits of tin. They sell for $78.;
  (star) Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum Shop, 1342 Naglee Ave., San Jose. Open 9
a.m.-5 p.m. daily. (408) 287-9171. The place to go for that Egyptologist on
your list. The Rosicrucian shop carries items ranging in price from slides of
the museum (38 cents) to golden statues of Egyptian gods (up to $100). The
more popular gods are also featured on their own T-shirts, which are $15. The
shop also has books on ancient Egypt, including some for children, such as
"How to Make a Mummy.";   (star) Triton Museum of Art Collector's Gallery,
1505 Warburton Ave., Santa Clara. Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday-Friday and until
9 p.m. Tuesday; noon-5 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. (408) 247-3754. The Triton's
store is rather small, and opts to spend its space on more objets d'art than
books and cards. The Triton has a surprising collection of African objects,
including a Somali milking container for $98 and a leather shield from the
Masai tribe for $68. There is also a selection of jewelry, including sterling
silver pins in the shape of fish skeletons for $50.;   (star) American Museum
of Quilts and Textiles, 776 S. 2nd St., San Jose. Open 10 a.m.-4 p.m.
Tuesday-Saturday. (408) 971-0323. It's the place to go if you like quilts and
textiles. For the specialist there are such titles as "The Button Lover's
Book" and "America's Glorious Quilts." But there are also quilted Christmas
tree ornaments ($3.50) and quilted Christmas stockings ($20). The American
Museum of Quilts and Textiles also wins the award for homiest store. Get there
at lunchtime and you can hear the volunteers in the kitchen stirring up
something hot.;   (star) San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Books, 401 Van
Ness Ave., San Francisco. Open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday-Friday and until 9 p.m.
Thursday; 11 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. (415) 252-4035. As the name
implies, the Museum of Modern Art has books. Lots of books. Books about every
artist who's got a book, even unknown artists. Take "Thrift Store Paintings --
Paintings Found in Thrift Stores" ($45), which features works titled "Ochre
Baby Crawls on Man's Chest as Dog Looks On" and "Woman Made of Pillow, Wax
Lips, Green Thing." It's irresistible stuff.;   The museum also has a large
selection of children's books, including the "Art for Children" series that
attempts to get kids interested early. Somehow it seems unlikely that your
10-year-old nephew will be ecstatic with the ambitious-sounding "Diego
Rodriguez de Silva y Velasquez Art for Children," but what the heck. He'll
thank you in a decade or two.;   Also notable is the jewelry selection, which
is the best around if your tastes run to modern art. Prices range widely --
from a few dollars to thousands.;   (star) Mexican Museum La Tienda, Fort
Mason Center, San Francisco. Open noon to 6 p.m. daily through Dec. 24. (415)
441-0445. The Mexican Museum buys from 14 different importers to get goods
from all over Mexico. Right now, La Tienda is stocked with lots of tin
Christmas tree ornaments ($2.50-$12) along with the pottery, masks and
paper-mache figures that normally fill the room. Prices range from a few cents
for a tiny clay bird to $550 for an enormous copper pot.;   (star) M.H. de
Young Memorial Museum Store, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. Palace of the
Legion of Honor Store, Lincoln Park, San Francisco. Open 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m.
daily. (415) 750-3600. The shops of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco
share a lot of the same merchandise. They're where you can get replicas of
Degas' dancer in a substance called "Alvastone" ($85) and limited edition
plaques from Holland ($475).;   But there are also silk scarves of Frank Lloyd
Wright's "Tree of Life" pattern ($35) and museum T-shirts ($15). There are
even stocking stuffer bookmarks (50 cents).;   The de Young store is
significantly larger than the tiny Palace of the Legion of Honor store. And
now the Fine Arts Museums have an outlet on the fifth floor of Macy's on Union
Square.;   (star) California Academy of Sciences Store, Golden Gate Park, San
Francisco. Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. (415) 221-5100. This store is a little
hard to find, but it's worth it. Ask for directions. The Academy Store has a
wide selection for both children and adults. We'll start with the adults.;  
There's an amethyst necklace from Uruguay ($265), woodcuts of California
wildlife by Jim and Lisa Pesl ($65 unframed), hand-painted safari plates from
Italy decorated with zebras, tigers, giraffes and jungle plants ($25 for
dinner plates, $22.50 for salad plates) and a wooden model of a spotted
sturgeon ($17.95).;   For kids, there are plush hand puppets you probably
won't find many other places. Along with the more cuddly animals, the puppets
include crabs, bats and octopuses ($12.95-$15.95). You can buy Catgrass Seed
and grow snacks for your cats ($9), or pick up an Astronaut Ice Cream Sandwich
("Ready to eat! Freeze Dried!! Will not melt!!!" $2). And then there's the
Butterfly Garden, with packaging that says it's fun and educational, and adds,
"Mail the enclosed free coupon for your caterpillars!" Oh boy.;   (star) The
San Francisco Opera Shop, 199 Grove St., San Francisco. Open 11 a.m.-5 p.m.
Monday; 11 a.m.-curtain Tuesday-Friday; noon-curtain Saturday. (415) 565-6414.
It's not in a museum, but the San Francisco Opera has its own store, stocked
with merchandise you might more frequently find imprinted with "San Francisco
Giants" than "San Francisco Opera." There are opera T-shirts (most $14.95),
opera baby bibs ($4.95) and opera suspenders ($25).;   There are also opera
recordings. Hundreds of them. And there's that chocolate candy from Austria,
Mozart Kugeln, of course.;   (star) The San Francisco Ballet Shop, 455
Franklin St., San Francisco. Open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday-Friday. (415)
861-5600. This shop is for the serious dancer. The "Nutcracker" souvenirs are
sold at performances in the War Memorial Opera House.;   The ballet shop, on
the other hand, carries shoes and leotards -- and the heating pads, hot wraps
and cold wraps that convince shoppers ballet is not for the squeamish.;   But
there are also a few more general items, like a San Francisco Ballet water
bottle ($6.95) and San Francisco Ballet sweat shirts ($38 and $48). (box)  </TEXT>
