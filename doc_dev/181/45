With or without a mayoral proclamation, 1989 is shaping up to be a bountiful 
year for the visual arts in San Diego. The Soviet Arts Festival, scheduled for 
October and November, will undoubtedly get the heaviest dose of hype of any 
local art event this year. In terms of visual art offerings, however, the 
festival promises to be mostly bark and very little bite. 
</P>
<P>
The rich and diverse programming that has quietly slipped onto the books of 
local museums and galleries for the year attests to both the city's potential 
and its accomplishment much more convincingly than any of the spectacles 
planned by the mayor. Exhibitions organized by major institutions across the 
country will be stopping in San Diego for a spell this year and, more 
important, local art museums will be spreading their wealth as well. 
</P>

The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art continues to lead the pack in this 
regard, this year initiating two touring exhibitions, beginning with the first 
comprehensive museum retrospective of the work of Vernon Fisher, a Texas-based 
artist known for his complex and often obtuse narrative works. After its La 
Jolla debut (Feb. 3-April 2), the show will travel to the Albright-Knox Gallery 
in Buffalo, New York, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston and other 
distinguished venues. Later in the year, the museum will exhibit the work of 
designer Emilio Ambasz (June 9-Aug. 6). The show will explore Ambasz's 
contribution to architecture, industrial design and graphic arts, and will also 
be seen in Montreal and several other American cities. 
</P>

The San Diego Museum of Art, hardly a vigorous exporter of its creative 
products, will travel only one of its exhibitions this year, a retrospective of 
the Spanish Impressionist painter, Joaquin Sorolla (Sept. 16-Oct. 28), 
co-organized with the Institute of Modern Art in Valencia. The museum's 
schedule for the year, however, does reflect a more adventurous importing 
policy than usual. 
</P>

Its show, "Art For the Public: New Collaborations" (March 1-April 9), from the 
Dayton Art Institute, offers an educational perspective on the highly 
provocative arena of public art, through plans and models of seven projects 
throughout the country. The Bronx Museum of the Arts will be sending "Latin 
American Presence in the United States, 1920-1970" (May 22-July 16), which 
focuses on how the U.S. has acted as "stimulus, source, haven, receptor or 
locus" in the work of artists from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's sporadic steps into contemporary art and art linked to other 
cultures touch on firmer ground this year with these two shows as well as an 
exhibition featuring the paintings of Li Huai. Trained in Beijing and now 
living in San Diego, Huai explores the experience of working in such disparate 
milieus in her show, "An Artist in Two Cultures" (June 10-July 23).

With the demise of most of the city's serious contemporary galleries in the 
past few years, local artists have seen their home-based opportunities dwindle. 
Of the galleries that remain (or have newly opened), only the Dietrich Jenny 
Gallery maintains a strong and consistent commitment to local artists. This 
year the gallery will show work by Steven Criqui and Michael Cuddington (Jan. 
5-Feb. 4), Amanda Farber (Feb. 9-March 11), Ernest Silva (April 20-May 20) and 
Wick Alexander (May 25-June 24). 
</P>
<P>
Local artists will have a chance to respond directly to one another's work in 
Installation Gallery's new "Hothouse" program. Each month, a different artist 
will make his or her mark on an appointed section of the gallery, modifying the 
work of the previous month's creator and setting the stage for the next. The 
gallery will also spotlight the downtown art scene once again with its annual 
Artwalk (April 22-23), a weekend of open studios, galleries and special 
exhibitions. Sushi Gallery's annual "Streetseries" presentation of art in 
public spaces (Feb.10-March 11) promises to ignite the city as well, in its own 
surreptitious and subversive ways. 
</P>
<P>
Other stimulating experiences in store for the year include the "Rosenberg Era 
Art Project," a traveling show of historic and contemporary work along the 
themes of patriotism and the Rosenberg trial itself (at Installation and the La 
Jolla Museum Downtown, Sept. 8-Oct. 21), the Thomas Babeor Gallery's exhibition 
of work by the elusive Surrealist Joseph Cornell (March 17-April 16), and the 
San Diego State University Art Gallery's sponsorship of a site-specific 
collaboration by New York artists Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler (April 21-May 
24).

While the mayor's decision to bypass the city's natural links to Latino culture 
and concentrate its first international arts festival instead on the remote 
expressions of the Soviet Union generated a measurable amount of flak, that 
bond will not go unexplored this year. In addition to the SDMA's "Latin 
American Presence" exhibition, three promising shows are scheduled at four 
different venues. "Young Mexican Painters" will be shared between the Mesa 
College Art Gallery and Palomar College's Boehm Gallery (March 17-April 27), 
and will be accompanied by a symposium on Mexican and Chicano art. 
</P>
<P>
Sushi Gallery will organize a show of work by Hispanic women from Tijuana and 
San Diego (March 17-April 15), and the Centro Cultural de la Raza, which faces 
the challenge this year of sustaining its momentum through a change in 
leadership, will present a show of photographs by Latina women that was curated 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
If the efforts of a consortium of contemporary art venues -- LJMCA, UC San 
Diego's Mandeville Gallery, SDSU's Art Gallery, Installation, the Centro and 
Sushi -- materialize, a group of Soviet artists will be brought to San Diego as 
artists-in-residence in the fall. Then, perhaps, the Soviet Arts Festival will 
elicit as much vitality and energy as the city's arts institutions strive for 
all year, every year.
