   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) _ It's been a long, strange trip
for the oil painting of the nude woman and Cupid now hanging in a
Bard College gallery.
   The painting was found years ago in a hayloft with a modest fig
leaf painted on Cupid and the chubby, prone woman's breasts
enlarged. A private collector bought the painting, removed the
bogus overpainting and cleaned it over three years.
   The collector, who refuses to reveal his identity, says he's
convinced the painting was created in a Venice studio by Titian,
one of the greatest painters of the Italian Renaissance.
   The art world isn't so sure.
   That puts the purported Titian in the same boat as many of the
80 works of art exhibited at ``A Connoisseur's Quest,'' a new
gallery exposition at this Hudson Valley college.
   Paintings from Europe, carvings from Africa and ancient Egyptian
pottery are coming under scrutiny for the first time as art
detectives try to weed out bonafide masterpieces from artful
forgeries.
   Art historians and others who breath the rarefied air of the art
world have begun debating whether particular works are really
Raphael's or Durer's or El Greco's.
   ``Some of these pieces will be shrouded in mystery for the rest
of their existence,'' said Linda Weintraub, curator of the Edith C.
Blum gallery.
   The exhibit, which Weintraub shepherded here, is unique in that
the pieces are being shown to the public for the first time after
being held in a private collection for decades _ some for up to 50
years.
   The collector credits Weintraub, a longtime acquaintance, with
persuading him to share his private treasure with the public after
all these years. His identity though, remains hidden so as not to
deflect attention from the art, he said.
   ``The object of the collection is not the collector. The object
is the art,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I'm glad to have
it scrutinized.''
   The scrutiny in this case means students of art looking for
subtle clues that would place a work in time, or a technique that
would distinguish a creation as belonging to a particular artist.
   The question with the picture of the nude woman and Cupid is
whether the painting is a first version of Titian's ``Danae,''
which depicts the picture's namesake just after being impregnated
by Zeus.
   Weintraub said such aficionados as former Metropolitan Museum of
Art curator Thomas Hoving have applied their critical eye to the
work and believe it to have come from the brush of Titian.
   One dissenting voice comes from artist Martin Canin who says
``the painting lacks the quality of execution'' to be a real Titian.
   ``I'm sure it's not,'' he said. ``There's just too many bad
passages.''
   Canin said his painter's eyes can see what many art historians
cannot. In ``Danae,'' he sees an un-Titian-like linear approach to
the work and an ``amateurish'' painting of the figures' feet and
toes. Canin thinks the painting was a product of a contemporary
workshop or student.
   A big problem with sorting out the works of the European masters
is that most of them trained their young students to paint just
like them _ often exactly like them. Weintraub said many students
were instructed to paint over the master's sketches and even copy
their work outright.
   ``Even pieces with signatures can easily have been done by
students,'' she said.
   Also, in the days before photocopiers or even photos, copying
the great contemporary works by hand for affluent buyers was a
common practice.
   Unlike people who study stones or stars, art sleuths usually
rely on more esoteric means to weed out masterworks from copies.
   Bonnie Solomon, an art restorer with Solomon &amp; Mattozzi of New
York City, shined a black light on ``Danae'' to determine if the
work was fudged with overpainting.
   ``There was some work done on it, but not a lot,'' she said.
Solomon said she's pretty sure the Titian is the real thing along
with another possible masterpiece by the European master El Greco,
but admitted there are some incredible fakes in existence.
   The presumed El Greco, a palm-sized painting of Christ at
Calvary looking imploringly up to heaven, could represent the
finest of the painter's work.
   Then again, just like the Titian, it could be the work of one of
his rivals or students, or any exceptionally talented painter
familiar with El Greco's work.
   ``This could be a student's, it could be a copy, it could be
from 200 years after his death,'' Weintraub said. ``But look at his
eyes. How could it be by anyone else?''
   Even established works of art can become suspect. Vincent Van
Gogh's ``Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' is familiar to anyone who
has ever flipped through an art book. The painting has been in the
Metropolitan for years as one of the pearls in its collection. Now,
a leading scholar has raised questions about its authenticity.
   ``There's little certainty about any work,'' Weintraub offered.
   Paintings for non-European works are less problematic in terms
of determining the creator. Artisans kept a lower public profile in
most other cultures and so works by any particular person tend to
be less in demand in the art world.
   But they do pose other problems.
   ``Some of these works, we just have no idea where they're
from,'' Weintraub said.
   Works shown in the Bard exhibit such as the Chinese Buddha and
little icons of Egyptian deities are easy to trace, but others
aren't. Experts agree a small, carved ivory spoon shown at Bard is
from Africa. But where, when and even the why of the spoon is
debatable.
   ``All the scholars are bewildered,'' Weintraub said. ``Even if
there's a consensus, it's never absolutely known.''
   Still, the mystery collector says he's relatively unconcerned
that someone might soon come up with some devastating evidence his
Durer or ancient Greek coins are not what they appear to be.
   ``I bought all the work for its visual power,'' he said. ``It
wouldn't change the effectiveness of the work one bit.''
