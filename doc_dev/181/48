Art lovers who also find excitement in that national pastime -- the game of 
baseball -- can combine both interests by visiting "Diamonds Are Forever: 
Artists and Writers on Baseball," an exhibition combining both visual artworks 
and literature on the game, opening at the Oakland Museum on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes 112 paintings, drawings, prints, photographs and 
sculpture, and features works by artists including Claes Oldenburg, Raoul Dufy, 
Elaine de Kooning, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Alex Katz and Eric Fischl. 
Featured literary passages on baseball are by John Updike, Garrison Keillor, 
Phillip Roth, Bernard Malamud, Neil Simon and others. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an absolute commonality of experience in the life of the (artists and 
writers) represented in the exhibition," said Don Grant, the museum's head 
preparator and exhibition designer. "Baseball is a part of all of our 
experience, at least at one point in time. And I think that's one of the 
reasons for (the artists') doing these works -- to give a sense of importance 
to the game and to people's experiences at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Grant said another reason for the exhibition, which was organized by the New 
York State Museum in Albany, is to "illustrate the mythic or iconic quality of 
baseball as it's perceived in many people's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
One work that particularly illustrates that "mythic" quality, Grant said, is 
Michael Langenstein's "Play Ball." In a takeoff on Michelangelo's "Creation of 
Adam," Langenstein's post-card collage depicts Michelangelo's hand reaching up 
to the hand of God and passing him a baseball. The work illustrates the passing 
on of youth and innocence that can be accomplished through baseball, Grant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other themes depicted in the art works, Grant said, include "archetypal 
conflict situations (in which) one person is poised against all the elements," 
and works that "speak to how one's image as a kid growing up is . . . formed in 
relation to other kids (by) comparing oneself through baseball." As an example 
of the latter, Grant cited "Boys at Bat," by Eric Fischl, which shows "an image 
of a naked ball player, an older boy, batting, and a younger boy looking on." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which is divided into five thematic sections -- The Place, The 
Equipment, The Players, The Action and Something Else, which involves less 
tangible elements such as childhood memories and the smells of spring -- runs 
through Feb. 7.

LABOR: Works of art by Los Angeles workers whose unions are affiliated with the 
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, and three paintings by union 
guest artist Phyllis Diller go on view Monday at the City Hall Bridge Gallery, 
201 N. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
The "20th Annual Union Artist Exhibit" includes 115 pieces of painting, 
sculpture and photography. Works by union members and their children were 
entered in a juried competition that included the categories of amateur works, 
professional works, high school and college works, grade-school works, and 
works by undocumented workers who have applied for amnesty through the county 
labor federation's Labor/Immigration Project. 
</P>
<P>
According to the federation, the purpose of the show is to call attention to 
the "hidden" talents of working people.
