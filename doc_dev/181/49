"I refuse to be one of 'the boys,' " said George Yepes, as he lashed out at 
what he called the current trend for curators, dealers and others to group all 
Latino artists together. "I don't want to be grouped with the artists that are 
out right now. These guys today took the guts out of Hispanic art. People like 
Siqueiros, Orozco -- the old Mexican masters -- they are rolling over in their 
graves right now. But they have to pass the baton over to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Yepes' latest attempts to run with that baton went on view Thursday at Santa 
Monica's B-1 Gallery. The artist's reception for the show, called "Midnight 
Devil Dancing," will be held June 28. 
</P>
<P>
Featured are about 10 paintings, including the 25-foot "Self Portrait 1990: 
Rapture of the Sublime," which depicts Yepes and his ever-present fiance locked 
in a kiss, surrounded by a number of fighters and slain figures representing 
"the casualties of war today." Also included in the autobiographical work is a 
pair of boxers in a ring -- reminiscent of the days when Yepes himself boxed -- 
and a series of green-faced men, which Yepes said represents the attorneys now 
embroiled in his life because of disputes with East Los Streetscapers, a mural 
painting group that Yepes left a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yepes, 34, who recently completed the "Lady of the East Side" mural at 4th 
Street and the 101 Freeway, has four additional mural projects under 
discussion, as well as two more pending approval of Cultural Affairs grants 
from the city of Los Angeles. But his next project is for a totally different 
medium -- the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
The artist has been commissioned by the producers of "Bewitched Affair" -- 
which stars Mark Hamill and Apollonia and begins filming this week -- to paint 
works for a gallery that will be created as one of the film's key locations. 
</P>
<P>
For the film, which will include "a huge love scene" right under one of his 
works, Yepes plans to paint "kind of epic things" dealing mainly with passion 
and witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
The short-haired, clean-cut Yepes -- dressed in a white Yves Saint Laurent 
dress shirt and black slacks and shoes -- noted that he doesn't look like a 
typical artist and doesn't fit in with the "misdirected calling that says (to 
be an artist) you've got to have long hair or a beard, live like an artist, and 
have paint on your pants." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he says: "What's important is the art. I'd rather somebody know my 
work than know me. . . . I paint for history -- for what they're going to say 
about the artwork 50 years from now. I want history to look back . . . and say, 
'Wow, this guy could paint.' "

CURRENTS 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum will put its $8,500 National Endowment for the Arts grant 
toward the purchase of a set of the 150 prints produced to date by Los Angeles' 
Self-Help Graphics. Included are works by 70 artists such as Diane Gamboa, 
Frank Romero and Gronk. 
</P>
<P>
According to Self-Help Graphics' curator Alex Alferov, the museum's purchase 
will give more importance to the work done by the nonprofit workshop and its 
Hispanic artists. 
</P>
<P>
Self-Help Graphics is excited about the purchase because being in a prestigious 
museum collection validates all the years of work founder and director Sister 
Karen Boccalero has done with the Latino artists, Alferov said. "For the 
artists it is a confidence builder and gives historical value to their work as 
it becomes part of a major collection." 
</P>
<P>
Self-Help Graphics began producing prints in 1982 by inviting Chicano artists 
from East Los Angeles to collaborate with master printers. The Laguna museum 
plans to exhibit the prints in a series of exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Two fourth-grade classes from San Pedro Street School in downtown Los Angeles 
will participate in a new educational outreach program set up at the County 
Museum of Art in conjunction with the exhibition "The New Vision: Photography 
Between the World Wars." The program, called "Family Keepsakes," includes 
activities in both the museum and the classroom. The goal of "Family Keepsakes" 
is to introduce children to photography and other media as a means of creative 
expression and interpretation of the world around them. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the program will create their own family keepsakes -- an album of 
photographs, drawings or other objects they have created and collected. These 
projects will then be circulated by the museum's Education Department to 
schools and public libraries throughout the L.A. area begining in the fall of 
1990.

THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
Art dealers Richard Heller and Bennett Roberts are no longer content with 
simply running their own Richard/Bennett Gallery on La Brea Avenue. The two 
have now taken to curating shows for other galleries, the first of which is 
"The New Fabricants," a show featuring 14 emerging artists, which opened Friday 
at Santa Monica's Richard Green Gallery. Other curatorial projects underway for 
the duo include a group show opening June 21 at S. Bitter-Larkin Gallery in New 
York and a show scheduled for next February at Peter Weber Gallery in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Neo-pop artist Jim Evans will be honored on Wednesday at a special reception at 
6:30 p.m. at the Karl Bornstein Gallery in Santa Monica. On view for the 
one-night only will be 30 of Evans' original monoprints, proceeds from the sale 
of which will benefit Westside Sane/Freeze, a national peace and nuclear 
disarmament organization. 
</P>
<P>
Evans was commissioned by Westside Sane/Freeze to create a work commemorating 
the eighth anniversary of the United Nations Special Session on Nuclear 
Disarmament, as well as the January, 1991, U.N. Conference on Disarmament. The 
work, "End of the Dream," depicts Albert Einstein surrounded by symbols of the 
nuclear arms race and the scientist's famous quote, "You cannot simultaneously 
prevent and prepare for war."

OVERHEARD 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at all that we're competing against (such as movie premieres and 
other star-studded events), it's nice to see that art can still draw a crowd." 
-- A publicist who handles prestigious fine art accounts, referring to the 
turnout -- which included such artists as George Herms, Robert Graham and Lita 
Albuquerque as well as Meryl Streep, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kim Carnes, and 
several paparazzi and media types -- at a recent Santa Monica gallery reception 
for "Artists Unite for Big Green," a benefit for the Environmental Protection 
Act of 1990 initiative.
