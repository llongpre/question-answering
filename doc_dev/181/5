   A museum in southeastern Mexico offers clues to
three civilizations that predate the Aztecs. Among other things,
there is evidence that these ancient people probably perceived the
earth as round, designed remarkably accurate calendars and had an
advanced knowledge of mathematics and astronomy.

   Huge carved stone heads, tiny clay figures
and thousands of other artifacts at a museum here tell a strange
story about three civilizations that flourished long before
Columbus discovered America.
   It's about the Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecs, who inhabited a
long stretch of coast on the Gulf of Mexico.
   The fascinating and sometimes gruesome story is told vividly at
the Museum of Xalapa, which specializes in the region's
archaeological treasures.
   A lot is still unknown about the three civilizations. They are
believed to have been part of a series of migrations from Asia that
started about 35,000 years ago across the Bering Strait, by way of
Alaska, and lasted several millenia.
   But, says museum director Fernando Winfield Capitaine, ``as new
finds are made and studies of old ones shed new light, the results
may rewrite quite a few history books.
   ``We don't know what their language was, or what they even
called themselves,'' he adds. ``Even the names we use for them are
false and relatively new. They are `nahuatl' names, the trading
language of the Aztecs, which didn't even exist at the time.''
   Only 3,000 of the museum's 29,000 pieces are on display for lack
of space. They tell how these people performed human sacrifices,
probably perceived the earth as round, designed remarkably accurate
calendars and had an advanced knowledge of mathemathics and
astronomy, among other things.
   The artifacts range in size from a tiny Olmec carving of a rain
god 4 inches high, to huge stone altars. The museum's centerpiece
is a monolithic head 9 feet high and weighing 16 tons, carved from
andesite rock.
   Now housed in a new $3 million set of modern buildings covering
14,400 square yards and surrounded by eight acres of wooded park,
the museum is part of the Veracruz state university in Xalapa, the
state's capital 74 miles northwest of the port of Veracruz.
   The Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecas based their agriculture on
corn, frijole beans and squash, supplementing their diets with dog
meat, river fish and wild animals and birds, which they seasoned
with chili peppers, herbs and other spices.
   Both their weapons and their tools were crude, mostly made out
of stone or wood, and no one is sure how they carved such huge
stone statues. But their civilizations were surprisingly advanced
for its time.
   In his guidebook ``Master Works of the Xalapa Museum,'' Mexican
anthropolgist Alfonso Medellin Zenil says it's possible the Olmecs
were the first to make paper out of wood pulp in America.
   Archaeologists believe the political organization was more of a
loose coalition of small towns or city-states than one big
government entity. But their influence spread far and wide and some
of it survives in present-day Mexico.
   They could read and write and knew what a wheel was, but didn't
use it, probably because they had no draft animals. Their ancestors
had hunted them all out of existence, including the ancient
American horse and the elephant.
   They spun and wove fibers, including cotton. They tailored their
clothes, wore earrings and jewelry, blackened their teeth with
natural tar for cosmetic purposes and made rubber from the rubber
tree, which is native to the region.
   Being cross-eyed was considered a sign of beauty.
   By polishing metallic rock, the Olmecs made flat mirrors which
they hung over their chests as jewelry, or concave ones, which they
used to light fires.
   They made music on drums, whistles, ocarinas, clay flutes and
other instruments. They traveled and traded extensively, as far
west as the Pacific Coast and as far south as El Salvador in
Central America, spreading their cultures and acquiring new ones.
   As a result, cacao _ the bean from which chocolate is derived
and is native to the Gulf Coast _ became a popular currency for
trade throughout pre-Columbian Mexico.
   At first, they cremated or simply buried their dead, but later
they built little pyramidal rock mounds to mark the sites. Later
still, they built the monumental pyramids that survive today.
   They played a ceremonial sport with a rubber ball, which was a
combination of soccer and basketball. The winning team was
afterwards beheaded as a sacrifice, usually to a sun god, although
some authorities claim it was the losers who lost their heads.
   Other victims had their hearts cut out atop some pyramid or
other sacred altar. Some were skinned alive and priests donned
their skins to dance before Xipe Totec, the ``god of the flayed,''
in a fertility rite to mark the beginning of spring.
   Prisoners of war often had their hands severed so the victors
could acquire their strength, skill and magic.
   Worship was centered on the sun, the moon and the planet Venus.
   All three cultures worshipped the jaguar as a sun god and
hunting the animal was forbidden, except for its skins, which
priests wore during sacred ceremonies. The jaguar was often
depicted in partly human form.
   It was said that in times long past a woman mated with a jaguar,
giving birth to a ``were-jaguar.'' Archeologists believe this
explains the Olmecs' morbid fascination with dwarfs, hunchbacks and
other human deformations.
   Little is known about Venus, usually depicted as the lesser of
the three, except that Ehecatl Quetzalcoatl, god of the hurricane
and other winds, and Xochiquetzal, goddess of love and the spring,
were probably associated with it.
   The most fascinating of the moon deities was Tlasolteotl, the
Totonaca goddess of confession, protectress of childbirth and
advocate of illicit love and passions. She encouraged people to sin
so that she could later absolve them.
   Sinners had to confess to her, so that she could devour the
``rubbish or spiritual garbage'' that weighed upon them.
   ``But,'' says Winfield, ``only one confession was allowed in a
lifetime, and people tried to put it off as much as they could,
since there was no forgiveness for a second offender.''
