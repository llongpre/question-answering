The "outsider" viewpoints of people who don't feel at home within a dominant 
culture are at the heart of the visual arts component of the Los Angeles 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these artists are looking at each other's Pacific Rim cultures with a 
coolly dissecting eye, allowing Eastern and Western ideas and images to invade 
one another and raise more questions than they answer. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists are in some sense strangers to their own societies -- because of 
cultural roots, sexual orientation or a rejection of the consumer-oriented 
practices of the contemporary art world.

At the University Art Museum at Cal State Long Beach (Friday through Dec. 2), 
Chinese artist Wenda Gu will create a site-specificinstallation, "Red, Black, 
White, Desert." The work will involve the juxtaposition of raincoats made of 
woven palm bark -- the type worn by rural Chinese workers -- with minimalist 
abstract canvases painted in alternating fields of red, black and white. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this work lies an idiosyncratic way of viewing the world that, for all 
its brash contemporaneity, stems from the tradition of the great 
"individualist" artists of the Yuan and early Ch'ing Dynasties -- maverick 
artists like Hung-jen and Chu Ta, who retired from the world during tumultuous 
periods of Chinese history and cultivated eccentric signature styles. The 
difference is that Gu remains very much a part of the world, making art that is 
political by implication, if not in overt ways. 
</P>
<P>
Gu, who now lives in New York, was born in Shanghai in 1955. As a child of the 
Cultural Revolution, he painted propaganda posters before attending the School 
of Arts and Crafts in his native city and studying the traditional arts of 
(wooden) seal carving and landscape painting. 
</P>
<P>
An obsessive reader and philosophizer, in the tradition of the literati 
painters of Chinese history, Gu became interested in the writings of such 
vastly disparate Western philosophers as Friedrich Nietzsche and Ludwig 
Wittgenstein and the works of such modern Western artists as Marcel Duchamp, 
Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol and Joseph Beuys. 
</P>
<P>
He began to see his work as a way of stirring up the caldron of past and 
present -- of combining slogans he saw on the street with ancient poems and 
making mutant seals in which the calligraphy was fractured and rearranged. 
Slamming together bits and pieces of diverse eras, lifestyles and cultures in 
his installations, he finds conflict more fruitful than the aura of tranquility 
generally associated with Asian art. 
</P>
<P>
Delighting in paradoxes and riddles, he is a black humorist with a strong 
mystic streak. Describing a 1987 performance piece of his involving bloody 
gloves, red tubes and a small house structure made of mixed media paintings, Gu 
wrote, "The atmosphere was very sexual and painful. Only my desire was 
present."

At the Long Beach Museum of Art, "Traversals: Instructions to the Double" 
(today through Sept. 30) is a program of nine videotapes assembled by guest 
curator Peter Callas. The works in the show are all by Pacific Rim artists who 
have visited other cultures and responded not with travelogues but with 
open-ended, highly subjective meditations. Unconventional editing and 
post-production work emphasizes the rhythms and layers of imagery the artists 
perceived in their travels. 
</P>
<P>
In Edin Velez's "Meaning of the Interval" (18 minutes, 1987), the subject is 
empty space. Known as ma in Japan, prolonged intervals -- of space or time -- 
are considered a source of harmonic energy. They exist everywhere: in 
buildings, paintings, even on the slow-moving Noh theater stage. 
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico-born Velez (who now lives in New York) looks at the large and small 
manifestations of ma in Japan: from the distance between one subway station and 
another to a stark white line that divides in half -- revealed as the space 
between the two pillars of a Shinto temple gateway. Using post-production 
wizardry to alter the sizes and positions of his imagery, Velez also emphasizes 
peculiar juxtapositions of conservative and outre behavior in modern-day Japan. 
These are the "spaces" that separate different pockets of life in a 
hierarchical and superficially orderly society. 
</P>
<P>
Naoko Kurotsuka's "The Palm" (5 minutes, 1985) was shot at a long-abandoned 
temple arch in the ruins of Ayuttheya in Thailand -- a site at once familiar to 
a Japanese (because of the countries' shared Buddhist culture) and undeniably 
foreign. Static shots focus on details of the natural world that continues to 
flourish despite the lack of human presence. To begin and end each shot, the 
Japanese artist cupped her hands over the lens, as if helping each image to be 
born and to die. 
</P>
<P>
Although Westerners consider ancient, unchanging landscape as the essence of 
timelessness, Kurotsuka writes, in the East, timelessness is equivalent to "the 
ever-changing state of temporary nature." 
</P>
<P>
Other video artists represented in the show are Geoffrey Weary, Robert Cahen, 
Ko Nakajima, Tony Conrad, Steina Vasulka, Bruce and Norman Yonemoto and Callas.

At the Los Angeles Photography Center, "Golden Pool" (Sept. 4 through Oct. 14) 
brings together the photographic work of 12 artists -- some established, some 
emerging -- who live in Southern California and explore different aspects of 
Asian and Asian-American cultural experience. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Lee blows up stills from Chinese movies of the '20s, '30s and '40s to 
"big screen" size and adds statements reflecting her ironic take on the 
contemporary status of Chinese-American women. Carol Nye's black-and-white 
photographs investigate the ways minority groups in China adapt to the dominant 
culture. Other artists in the exhibit include May Sun, Patrick Nagatani and 
Alan Cheung.

"Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985" at the Wight Art Gallery, 
UCLA (Sept. 9 through Dec. 9) is a huge show, the largest ever assembled 
specifically on the art of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. (as distinct from 
Latino, Hispanic or Latin American art). This emphasis is on the relationship 
of the art to el movimiento, the Chicano civil rights movement of the '60s and 
'70s, which focused on demands for workers' rights, bilingual education, the 
abolition of racist cultural barriers, and the return of land to the 
descendants of original land-grant holders. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 130 paintings, prints, photographs and sculptures are the work of 
90 artists from across the U.S., chosen by a national advisory committee. It 
remains to be seen whether the show -- which unfortunately does not include 
performance or installation art -- will make a compelling case for individually 
distinctive voices of members of a minority group, or sink under the weight of 
curatorship-by-committee.

David Wojnarowicz's "Tongues of Flame," at the Santa Monica Museum of Art 
(through Sept. 5) is an exhibit of the artist's passionate and motley pieces 
from the past decade, which all deal in some way with his life as a gay man. 
Wojnarowicz -- who suffers from complications of AIDS and who endured a 
shockingly brutal and loveless youth -- works from the position of radical 
social outcast. By turns darkly fantastic and coldly nihilistic, his imagery of 
death, decay, violence, male sexuality and technological malfunction is 
virtually guaranteed to raise bourgeois hackles.

Robbie Conal's brand of guerrilla warfare is a kinder, gentler phenomenon, 
notable mostly for the dogged persistance with which he plasters thousands of 
his political posters throughout the U.S. Organized by the Pasadena Art 
Alliance, "Unauthorized History: Robbie Conal's Portraits of Power" at the 
Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena (Sept. 8 through Nov. 9), includes his 
deliberately unflattering images of such Reagan-Bush era figures as Jim and 
Tammy Bakker, John Poindexter, Jesse Helms and Ronald, Nancy and George.
