The striking beauty of Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photographs makes them 
irresistible from the very first glance. 
</P>
<P>
But their mysterious content is what keeps you looking. 
</P>
<P>
"Revelaciones: The Art of Manuel Alvarez Bravo," a retrospective of 113 
black-and-white photographs, opened last week at the Museum of Photographic 
Arts in Balboa Park and continues through Sept. 9. The show validates once more 
the 88-year-old Mexican artist's reputation as one of the greatest 
photographers of this century. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by Arthur Ollman, the museum's executive director, along with Nissan 
Perez, curator of photographs at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, this 
exhibition is more than just a survey of Alvarez Bravo's work since the 1920s. 
It also is a reminder that sensuality and political content can easily coexist 
in a single image, that matters of life and death can be treated simultaneously 
with humor and pathos, and that a single work of art is capable of expressing 
vast numbers of layered meanings. 
</P>
<P>
"Public Thirst," for example, a work from 1933, shows a young boy crouching on 
a ledge to drink from an outdoor water fountain. It's an everyday image, hardly 
a grand statement. From his bearing, you get the feeling that the child is a 
resourceful character, but still, he's just an ordinary boy, barefooted yet 
well-dressed in wrinkled but clean white slacks and shirt. And Alvarez Bravo 
doesn't succumb to the pitfalls of cute 
</P>
<P>
ness that ruin so many pictures of children -- the boy's head is turned away, 
he is anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The work's title indicates that there's more to this image than the kind of 
ordinary incident that has preoccupied photographers like Henri 
Cartier-Bresson, for example. This boy, whose dark skin identifies him as a 
native Mexican, is one of Alvarez Bravo's symbols for the Mexican people. And 
yet, as Perez points out in his essay in the catalogue for the show, the boy 
also represents young Mayan boys who once were sacrificed to quench the thirst 
of their gods. To make the connection between life and death, sacrifice and 
nourishment, the artist always pairs this work with a bloody image titled 
"Striking worker, assassinated," from 1934; in the latter a teen-age boy lies 
dead in the street, a victim and martyr whose face is stained by a fountain of 
blood that flows from his wounds. There is a parallel between the flow of the 
water and the flow of the blood. The ancient martyrdom of Mayan males is 
equated with the image of a contemporary political martyr. Youth is not a safe 
time, Alvarez Bravo seems to say. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez Bravo's style is rooted both in Mexican history -- with its 
pre-Columbian and Spanish mix of religious and pagan symbols -- and in European 
art history, particularly surrealism. But, generally, he doesn't divide his 
focus in one direction or the other. Modern and ancient, mundane and sacred 
blend gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the iconography seems somewhat obvious, though it's never simple. 
"Coatlicue," 1987, pairs two sculptures in a bed of wild flowers. The first, a 
small pre-Columbian fertility sculpture of a woman, nestles the second, a folk 
art plaster skeleton in its arms. It is a pose that alludes to, and perhaps 
even mocks, the iconic Christian image of Mary holding the dead Christ in her 
arms. Alvarez Bravo's skeleton is like those commonly used on the Mexican Day 
of the Dead holy day to symbolize the return to earth of dead relatives. It is 
also just one of the many signs indicating Mexican culture's blending of 
Christian ritual and Mayan beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, though, Alvarez Bravo's meanings are tough to decipher. More often 
than not, hints of deeper meaning are suggested only cryptically through 
titles. And the titles can be poetic, but still illegible to those who don't 
know much about Mexican culture, which is why the explanatory wall texts 
provided are so important and helpful in this exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Daughter of Dancers," for example, is a picture of a woman in traditional 
Mexican dress looking through a round window in a decorative brick wall; she 
stands in an odd posture, on her toes with one foot on top of the other. Perez 
explains that the title refers not only to dancers, but also to a kind of 
Mexican architectural carving, and that the woman is meant to be both an 
archetypal Mexican woman, and a reference to an indigenous Mexican art form. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not Alvarez Bravo's photographs are composed with a strong 
central image, so that the eye is drawn first to the abstract qualities of the 
compositions. He is a master at using light and dark passages to highlight his 
sense of mystery and draw out the sculptural qualities in his subjects. A 
portrait of Carlos Fuentes, for example, shows the figure's face half obscured 
by shadow. 
</P>
<P>
There are obvious debts in this work. For example, many of Alvarez Bravo's 
nudes where he shows just the female torso are clearly reminiscent of Edward 
Weston's work. And his experiments with X-rays represented by two images here 
owe much to the surrealist Man Ray. But despite such clear references, Alvarez 
Bravo adds his own flavor. His voluptuous subjects look like primitive 
fertility figures, not classical nudes, for example. His X-ray pictures are 
spiced with black humor. 
</P>
<P>
What remains surprising in a show spanning six decades of work is the 
consistency of the artist's interests and stylistic devices throughout. 
Happily, Alvarez Bravo's peculiar mix of patriotism and humor, mythology and 
life, has changed very little over the years. Alvarez Bravo knows how to 
provoke. And he knows how to please the eye. 
</P>
<P>
He's done both well for a very long time. After closing in San Diego, the 
exhibition travels on a two-year national tour to San Francisco, Detroit, 
Kansas City, Kan., Santa Barbara, Haverford, Pa., Coral Gables, Fla., and 
Cambridge, Mass.
