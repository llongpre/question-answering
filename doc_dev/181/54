Two men -- one Mexican, the other Jewish -- are swapping stories in a 
restaurant that has a French name and a Continental menu. As he dines on 
Italian food, the Mexican talks about a recent visit to New York City, where he 
found chiles poblanos in Brooklyn and a churro stand at a subway station. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish man, who has spent most of his life in the Southern California 
border region, alternates between Spanish and English as he tells a story about 
discovering a relative in Syracuse, N.Y. The Mexican counters with a tale about 
a compatriot who discovered a relative in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
There's no punch line to this series of unlikely scenarios, but there is a 
message: the world is becoming one big culture clash. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant patrons were writer-performer Guillermo Gomez-Pena and film 
maker Isaac Artenstein. The artists are preparing for the world premiere of 
their collaboration, a multimedia performance piece entitled "Border Brujo II." 
A brujo is a warlock or shaman. The premiere is being held, appropriately, in 
San Diego, where culture clashes are bred daily. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena illustrates these clashes by violently and repeatedly smashing his 
fists together. The sudden action energizes the room and sparks a 
transformation in the self-proclaimed "Border Brujo." 
</P>
<P>
"Brujos can practice lycanthropy," says Gomez-Pena with a gleam in his eyes. 
"That's what the border does. It makes you be other things." 
</P>
<P>
The border has made Gomez-Pena an award-winning performer. The original version 
of "Border Brujo" won him prizes at last year's International Theatre Festival 
of the Americas in Montreal and in the New York Dance and Performance Awards. 
He has performed the piece throughout the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday through Saturday at Sushi Performance Gallery, Gomez-Pena will perform 
the new version, a work-in-progress that incorporates a film produced and 
directed by Artenstein. The two artists were founding members of the Border 
Arts Workshop and the film is a result of their six-year collaboration. 
Eventually, the film will be distributed as a feature -- a creative 
documentation of Gomez-Pena's tour de force performance as a shaman who is the 
product of "the broken line," "the infected wound," "the umbilical cord": 
Gomez-Pena's descriptions of the border, where, as Artenstein says, "the first 
and the third worlds come together." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena's work revolves around language. He is a prolific writer, and his 
performances, whether on stage or across a cafe table, are verbal vortexes. In 
"Border Brujo," he speaks Spanish, English, "Spanglish," "Inglenol," and 
Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. It is an attempt, he says, "to create 
three simultaneous discourses of communication." He is especially intrigued by 
the audience's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"When I speak English, there is a sense of confrontation," he said. "When I 
speak Spanish, there is a sense of tenderness. And, when the text is bilingual, 
there is a sense of complicity." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena is an accomplice, and a willing one at that. The role of the brujo, 
he says, is "to guide other people through the border." It's seldom a peaceful 
journey. Sometimes, his performance has drawn responses that are "distrustful 
and aggressive . . . from people who are threatened by the presence of Latinos 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very interested in polarizing these issues because I think I can create a 
dialogue. Especially because the wounds are still fresh and open." 
</P>
<P>
He also speaks of reaching the people "who have escaped monolinguality and 
monoculturalism. Most of the inhabitants of this region are like that. Every 
time I come back, I am struck by the complexity of their lives -- the spiral 
journeys." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena's own journey started in his native Mexico City. "We thought of the 
border as all the stereotypes imaginable," he said. "We were victimized by 
misconceptions about the border. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mid-'70s, we were children of crisis in Mexico City, a generation 
disillusioned. Many went to Paris and Madrid, but many of us felt more American 
than European. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the prism of art, Mexican artists changed their perception of Chicano 
and border art." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena moved to Los Angeles in 1978. He worked as a journalist for 
Spanish-language newspapers and attended the California Institute of the Arts 
in Valencia. He moved to San Diego, and soon began collaborating with a group 
of artists who were inspired by the presence of the border. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a grass-roots, cross-cultural, utopian effort," Gomez-Pena says of the 
Border Arts Workshop's origins in the early to mid-'80s. "No one was claiming 
the border as a laboratory of cultural experimentation. We created a monster." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The workshop has garnered much critical acclaim and was recently the 
subject of an "Art in America" cover story. The genesis of "Border Brujo" came 
from the workshop's 1988 "Border Realities" exhibit at the Centro Cultural de 
la Raza. However, Gomez-Pena and Artenstein no longer claim membership in the 
workshop, preferring to go their own way as they allege an appropriation of 
their turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Museums are getting huge grants for border art when we couldn't get arrested 
for doing it," said Artenstein, referring to the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art's recent receipt of a $250,000 National Endowment for the Arts 
grant for a border art project. 
</P>
<P>
The institutionalization of border art is yet another irony, another dichotomy 
for these artists. But it's to be expected in a land where ironies and culture 
clashes abound. Consider this one: In his cluttered studio at Sushi, Gomez-Pena 
is surrounded by papers, posters, pictures and other paraphernalia relating to 
the border. This is the inner sanctum, the temple of border lore. At night you 
may see a faint light emanating from the second-story window. The border brujo 
is there, engrossed in ritual, conjuring his mystic visions as he sits before 
the shrine of the times -- a computer.
