AMONG THE WORKS of Mexican photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo is an image made 
in 1935 of a young woman seated in half shadow, wearing a dressing gown and 
striped shawl. Intruding through an unseen window is a prism of light, whose 
shape forms an uncanny, expanding echo of her profile. As she pulls back her 
long, shimmering hair, she stares into a pocket mirror. In it, she can see what 
she obviously already knows: that she is extraordinarily beautiful. Something 
else is also obvious. Her beauty terrifies her. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Alvarez Bravo, who will be honored with a major retrospective exhibition 
that opens July 12 at San Diego's Museum of Photographic Arts, is known for 
selecting titles as deliberately as he chooses his subject matter. If so, what 
ageless truth does he imply with this likeness, which he named "Portrait of the 
Eternal"? 
</P>
<P>
"The truth," suggests Mexican cinematographer Antonio Reynoso, Alvarez Bravo's 
friend and former student, "is that beauty is also terrible. It can paralyze 
the spirit. It can leave one breathless and immobile." He and Alvarez Bravo, he 
explains, live in a country that has been ravished repeatedly for its beauty, 
with waves of Spanish, French and North Americans usurping its gold, silver, 
land and spirit. "Don Manuel's photographs show that beauty and terror -- and, 
most of all, life and death -- are everlasting companions. Norteamericanos try 
to blind themselves to this reality." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego exhibition is intended to enlighten a North American audience 
largely unaware that, at age 88, Manuel Alvarez Bravo is considered one of the 
world's great photographic masters. Besides being acclaimed internationally for 
his wide-ranging body of work, he is regarded as the father of the thriving 
Mexican photography movement, which, according to the museum's director, Arthur 
Ollman, has produced some of the most original talent working in the medium 
today. Alvarez Bravo is, moreover, a living historical figure, a colleague and 
intimate of many of the century's most important artists, including muralists 
Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros; Rivera's wife, 
painter Frida Kahlo; surrealist Andre Breton, and photographers Edward Weston, 
Tina Modotti, Paul Strand and Henri Cartier-Bresson. 
</P>
<P>
Except for his friend Cartier-Bresson, living in Paris at age 82, Manuel 
Alvarez Bravo has survived them all. He resides in Coyoacan in southern Mexico 
City, a neighborhood of quiet cobbled streets and plazas shaded with laurels 
and ashes, where artists and poets drink espresso at outdoor cafes not far from 
the museum that was once the home of Kahlo and Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez Bravo is a thin man, with gray hair swept back from a lined face that 
seems to gather light. His voice is clear, complaining softly of how tired he 
is, then quickening with pleasure as he mentions colleagues whose lives have 
enriched his own. But anecdotes of who did what with whom no longer interest 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"There are books that tell about Tina, Diego, Clemente Orozco and Siqueiros," 
he says. "But what another person says about them is not important. What their 
work says, is." His own work provides a window into Mexican thought and 
perception, which Mexico's intellectuals and artists chronically insist are 
misunderstood in the United States. Unlike the forceful, monumental landscapes 
by the most celebrated modern photographer of the United States, Ansel Adams, 
Alvarez Bravo's photographic compositions are often subtle and mysterious. Rich 
with visual puns and ancient allusions, they lure a viewer into multiple levels 
of meaning and sensation. As literary laureate Octavio Paz writes in a poem 
that weaves an homage to Alvarez Bravo around several of his photographs' 
titles: 
</P>
<P>
. . . The eye thinks, 
</P>
<P>
the thought sees, 
</P>
<P>
the sight touches, 
</P>
<P>
the words burn. 
</P>
<P>
The differences between Adams and Alvarez Bravo reflect the contrast between 
their nations: one overwhelming the horizon with its blunt assertion of 
manifest destiny, the other always awaiting its mystical fate. Although Alvarez 
Bravo uses a camera, his vision derives from a land where, unlike the United 
States, technology has penetrated but never predominated. It is considered, 
rather, just another variant of a commonplace phenomenon in Mexican life: 
magic. 
</P>
<P>
MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO was born within a block of El Zocalo, Mexico City's vast 
central plaza. His family lived behind the Metropolitan Cathedral, northwest of 
the long, stone quadrangle of the National Palace. During his lifetime, the 
city has become the world's most populous; archeologists believe that when the 
conquistador Hernan Cortez arrived in 1519 -- when it was Tenochtitlan, the 
capital of the Aztec empire -- it also held that distinction. In 1902, the year 
of his birth, Alvarez Bravo's neighborhood comprised commercial streets and 
government offices, below which lay the ruins of an enormous temple. Like 
daydreams percolating up from the subconscious, the presence of this buried 
culture permeated the one superimposed above. 
</P>
<P>
With our practical sense of events having a firm chronological order, North 
Americans easily can grow perplexed in a country like Mexico, where time 
assumes liquid properties or evaporates altogether. Many Alvarez Bravo 
photographs blithely assume the coexistence of then and now, such as a portrait 
of a Mayan boy with a stone carving of what is evidently his face -- though the 
sculpture predates his birth by more than 1,000 years. Yet during Alvarez 
Bravo's early years, a leader who ruled like an ancient king had tried to 
cleave Mexico's past from its future and relegate its pre-Columbian heritage to 
mere memory. 
</P>
<P>
The country was in its third decade under the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz. 
Diaz had earned international adulation -- including Theodore Roosevelt's 
declaration that "among contemporary statesmen, there is none greater" -- for 
his determination to haul Mexico into the 20th Century. In a country left 
bankrupt and mired after a succession of wars, including one with the United 
States in which it lost half its territory, Diaz built factories, opened mines 
and connected Mexico's cities and frontiers with thousands of miles of railroad 
track. He financed his reforms with the cooperation of foreigners such as the 
Rockefellers, Hearsts and Guggenheims; they, in turn, received mineral, logging 
and ranching grants amounting to one-fifth of Mexico's territory. 
</P>
<P>
Of Mixtec Indian descent, Diaz increasingly regarded Mexico's native traditions 
as primitive and embarrassing. During his reign, thousands of Yaqui and Mayan 
Indians were enslaved and shipped to cotton, rice and hemp plantations. The 
dictator, meanwhile, was busy recasting Mexico City in what his patrician wife 
imagined to be the quintessential image of sophistication: Paris. He built a 
wide boulevard called the Paseo de la Reforma to replicate the Champs Elysees 
and raised an opulent, Parisian-style Palace of Fine Arts, to be filled with 
works emulating classic European aesthetic traditions. In a country studded 
with pyramids, he imported stone blocks from Europe for a lavish assemblage of 
new public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
One September morning when he was 8, Manuel Alvarez Bravo watched from the 
apartment of his godfather, a cashier in the Mexican treasury, as Diaz stood on 
the balcony of the Palacio Nacional and lorded regally over a massive 
demonstration. The dictator, resplendent in epaulets and plumed cap, was 
reviewing the largest celebration in Mexico's history, commemorating the 
centennial of its declaration of independence. It was, in fact, Diaz's final 
major public appearance; soon he would flee the country and the spreading 
nationwide peasant and Indian uprisings led by the likes of Pancho Villa and 
Emiliano Zapata. Alvarez Bravo's school days henceforth were punctuated by 
recurrent cannon and artillery blasts outside his classrooms, as Mexico 
collapsed into savage, chaotic revolution. In the afternoon, he would return 
home under skies filled with vultures circling the corpses of soldiers lying in 
his path. 
</P>
<P>
"We would find cartridges scattered on the ground. Chapultepec Park was filled 
with soldiers guarding the president's home. They sat on the grass, playing 
strange, sad melodies on their harmonicas. All these things," he says, "survive 
in the unconscious. They were dramatic events, but they also blended with daily 
life." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the fighting subsided, he was nearly 20. The daily events during 
his formative years included the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans. 
Over the centuries, life in Mexico had encompassed Aztec ritual human sacrifice 
and an even bloodier transition to Christianity. Following that, millions of 
Indians succumbed to smallpox, measles and other plagues imported from Europe. 
When, in 1822, Mexican independence finally halted 300 years of colonialism, 
none of its heroes escaped execution during the brutal aftermath. Civil wars, 
raging poverty, violent repression and now devastating revolution had conspired 
to keep one age-old Mexican ritual alive, re-enacted annually in its 
cemeteries. Each Nov. 2, the Day of the Dead, Mexicans flout death's audacity 
at trying to separate them from their loved ones by partying with the deceased, 
picnicking on their graves while children exchange candy skulls decorated like 
valentines with each others' names. 
</P>
<P>
"Toy skeletons and sugary little skulls," Alvarez Bravo likes to note, "are our 
most renowned popular art." In 1934 he would make his most famous photograph, 
one that epitomizes this mingled essence of sweetness and sorrow. Taken during 
a labor strike, it shows a protesting factory worker moments after he is 
murdered. His face and hair are drenched in fresh, flowing blood, but the 
photographer somehow managed to avoid making a mere political document. Shot at 
a close, almost intimate, perspective, the result depicts not gore but release, 
even serenity. A glint in the supine victim's eye suggests that death does not 
extinguish life, but furthers it. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan Perez, director of photography at Jerusalem's Israel Museum and 
co-curator of the San Diego retrospective, has written that Alvarez Bravo often 
exhibits this image alongside one taken a year earlier titled "Public Thirst." 
In it, a barefoot boy drinks at an outdoor fountain, a felicitous sunbeam 
crowning his hair with a halo. The title relates his poverty to the thirst of 
Mexico's gods that has always been slaked by popular sacrifice; the striker's 
impassioned death belongs to this tradition. Bloodshed repeatedly has nurtured 
growth and renewal in Mexico, and in no time did that prove truer than during 
the 1920s and 1930s after the revolution, a golden age that produced an 
astonishing outpouring of art and genius. 
</P>
<P>
So many teachers had left Alvarez Bravo's primary school to fight that by age 
13 he was gone himself, working as a copy clerk. For the next few years, he 
tried various careers, studying accounting, music, painting and homeopathy, all 
without marked success. During that time, the father of one of his friends 
would sometimes bring home cameras from the Monte de Piedad, Mexico's national 
pawnshop, which functions as bank for the poor. Alvarez Bravo was interested: 
Photography, he decided with relief, was something he could teach himself. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 21, he met Hugo Brehme, a photographer from Dresden who had 
traveled from Panama to Yucatan on a magazine assignment, then decided he liked 
Mexico and stayed. Brehme led him to another expatriate photographer, Wilhelm 
Kahlo, whose daughter Frida would one day sit for one of Alvarez Bravo's finest 
portraits. Brehme and Kahlo, both Germans, were not alone in Mexico. As the 
first major people's revolt of the century, the revolution had focused 
worldwide attention on the country. Writers Ambrose Bierce and D. H. Lawrence, 
filmmakers Sergei Eisenstein and Paul Strand and photographers Edward Weston 
and Tina Modotti were other American and European artists to whom 20th-Century 
Mexico's mystique, as well as its extraordinary quality of light, proved 
irresistible. To poet Andre Breton, the place virtually embodied surrealism. 
Their presence in the country reversed the traditional pilgrimage of Mexican 
artists to the Continent and to the United States, and in the years that 
Alvarez Bravo was Brehme's assistant, Mexico's own also were returning. 
</P>
<P>
Diego Rivera had spent the war in Europe; now he left Cubism and joined Orozco 
and Alfaro Siqueiros in adorning Mexico's public buildings. Their murals were a 
reaction against effete paintings confined to exclusive galleries; their 
subjects -- the Indians, laborers and peasants who had reasserted claim to 
their homeland -- were the antithesis of the old aristocratic values. 
</P>
<P>
At 23, a lean young man with a mustache, his hair worn back and slightly long, 
Alvarez Bravo married his childhood sweetheart, Lola Martinez. As photography 
was not yet a paying alternative, he accepted a job in Oaxaca with the Treasury 
Department. He stayed for two years, during which he entered a regional 
photography contest, submitting a scene from Chapultepec Park. It was a safe 
image, respecting the norms of Brehme's pictorial style: a rowboat on the lake, 
carefully framed by tree branches in the foreground. It won first prize. 
</P>
<P>
Thus encouraged, when he and Lola returned to the capital in 1927, he immersed 
himself in the exhilaration swirling through the cafes around the San Carlos 
National Academy of Fine Arts near the Zocalo. During his absence, the American 
photographer Edward Weston had been living and working in Mexico City with his 
lover, the Italian actress Tina Modotti, herself a gifted photographer. Weston 
had returned to the States, but Modotti remained behind to photograph murals 
for Rivera, Orozco and Alfaro Siqueiros. Alvarez Bravo had seen the famous 
couple together previously and had been studying their images in magazines. Now 
he arranged to meet Modotti and show her his work. 
</P>
<P>
One Weston still life, of a toilet, had been considered so disgraceful in 
Mexico that the magazine that printed it was forced to cease publication. Among 
the images that Modotti insisted that Alvarez Bravo send to Weston in 
California was one of a torso of a boy urinating into a porcelain bowl. He did 
so, with no explanation attached. An impressed Weston, having never heard of 
"M. Alvarez Bravo," suspected that Tina had actually taken the pictures. He 
wrote back: 
</P>
<P>
"I am wondering why I have been the recipient of a very fine series of 
photographs from you? . . . I must tell you how much I am enjoying them. 
Sincerely, they are important, and if you are a new worker, photography is 
fortunate in having someone with your viewpoint. . . . Perhaps the finest, for 
me, is the child urinating: finely seen and executed." 
</P>
<P>
Modotti introduced Alvarez Bravo to magazine editors and to Diego Rivera. Like 
many artists in the late '20s, both she and Rivera were members of the 
Communist Party, which in Mexico chiefly distinguished itself with ceaseless 
factionalism among its members. Rivera eventually was expelled for accepting 
bourgeois money to paint murals on government buildings, regardless of how many 
hammers and sickles he prominently featured. At one point, he personally 
escorted Leon Trotsky to Mexico City; Trotsky stayed with him and Frida Kahlo 
until an argument ended their friendship. Modotti, whose nude images 
scandalized conservative Mexicans, was implicated twice by the right-wing press 
as a murder suspect: first in the death of a Cuban party comrade, and second in 
an attempt on Mexican President Pascual Ortiz Rubio. For the latter charge, she 
was expelled from the country. Alvarez Bravo took her to the train depot. As 
she left Mexico City, she handed him her 8"-by-10" view camera. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez Bravo took her place as photographer to the muralists, a demanding 
opportunity that helped perfect his sense of visual composition. Unlike the 
flamboyant Rivera and the inflamed Alfaro Siqueiros, who was jailed frequently 
for his militant socialism, he was reserved, known as a meticulous worker and a 
listener. Although Alvarez Bravo joined the left-wing Revolutionary League of 
Writers and Artists, it was apparent that his passions lay in aesthetics, not 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera encouraged him to find images in Mexico's pueblos and sierras. What 
resulted was neither sentimentally picturesque nor folkloric, but an evocation 
of the unremarkable moments that add up to Mexico's remarkable essence. Nothing 
like what he produced had ever been seen before: "Like a ray of light 
penetrating a darkened room, revealing the particles suspended in the air," 
wrote Rivera. Through his lens, a dead tree in a field became a moaning 
apparition; a shadow formed a fantasy landscape; a brick kiln transmuted into 
an ancient city of burning pyramids and tombs. 
</P>
<P>
When Rivera became the San Carlos Academy's director, Alvarez Bravo joined the 
faculty. Backpacking his tripod and view camera, he would take students to the 
high plains of Lake Texcoco, the watery surroundings of the Aztec island empire 
until Diaz contracted the British to drain it. On such an arid steppe, Mexican 
novelist Juan Rulfo set his masterpiece "Pedro Paramo," which portrayed a 
village where both protagonist and readers could barely tell the living from 
the dead -- they themselves didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
Here, Alvarez Bravo produced pictures such as one innocently titled "A Horse 
for Riding on Sundays." In it, a rider gallops through a barren landscape past 
a huddled peasant family he never notices. It is Alvarez Bravo's only known 
photo of a live horse -- but strange, sometimes sinister, wooden or toy equines 
appear so often in his work that today nearly every aspiring Mexican 
photographer eventually aims his camera at one. Is this an intentional, 
symbolic reference to the mounts ridden by the conquistadors, who tricked the 
Indians into believing they were centaurlike gods? 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Alvarez Bravo sidesteps interpretations of his images, suggesting 
that people ask his photographs, not him, what they mean. "Shoot what you see, 
not what you think. A photographer's philosophy should be not to have one," 
he'd reply when students would try to probe his creative processes. In 1939, 
when Breton invited him to take part in a surrealist exhibition, he obligingly 
concocted an appropriately strange scenario: a nude model, her feet and loins 
partially wrapped in bandages, lying on a blanket surrounded by spiny cactus 
buds. Intended to be a spoof, the result -- cryptically titled "Good Reputation 
Sleeping" -- was so arresting that it became one of his most intensely analyzed 
photographs. Alvarez Bravo confesses that all the intrigue surrounding the 
picture led him to wonder himself what had inspired it. After identifying 
elements ranging from ballet rehearsals he'd witnessed to boyhood readings of 
Rousseau, he concluded: "You bring your accumulated life to the moment that 
something sparks you to make an image. Everything influences you. And it's all 
good." 
</P>
<P>
HECTOR GARCIA was a student at Mexico's National Polytechnic Institute in the 
early 1940s when he joined the emergency Mexican labor force that headed north 
to keep the United States functioning during World War II. One night in New 
York, while uncovering railroad tracks buried by a blizzard, an unscheduled 
military train hurtled through. The workers pressed themselves against the 
sides of the icy tunnel they'd excavated, but after it passed, the snow 
appeared to be covered with bright red poppies. Garcia, who carried a Brownie 
camera in his lunch pail, made several shots to record the wartime martyrdom of 
a Mexican bracero. His images, however, turned out blank -- he had not known 
how to compensate for the snow's reflection. 
</P>
<P>
The incident convinced him he should study photography. Back in Mexico City, he 
did so under Alvarez Bravo; eventually, Garcia became Mexico's most esteemed 
photojournalist, his work appearing in newspapers worldwide and in Time-Life 
publications. What he learned from Alvarez Bravo was not so much technique as 
attitude. "Don Manuel is that perfect Mexican mixture of two worlds, knowing 
what a European knows about art, and feeling what an Indian feels about land." 
</P>
<P>
"Until Alvarez Bravo, we had the formal portraits of the 19th Century and the 
photojournalism of the revolution," adds Pablo Ortiz Monasterio, editor of a 
distinguished Mexican series of photography books titled "Coleccion Rio de Luz" 
-- "The River of Light Collection." "With Don Manuel, Mexican photography as an 
expressive art became possible." 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz Monasterio belongs to the latest generation of Mexican fine-arts 
photographers who acknowledge their debt to Alvarez Bravo. Currently, the most 
renowned among his colleagues is Graciela Iturbide. In 1972, she was a 
30-year-old wife and mother who had resumed her education, taking film classes 
at the University of Mexico when she realized that Alvarez Bravo was teaching 
photography across the hall. One day she timidly approached him. To her 
surprise, he invited her to be his assistant. The principal message of his 
tutelage was summarized by a sign in his spotless darkroom. 
</P>
<P>
It read: "Hay tiempo" -- there is time. "Don't hurry," he kept telling her. 
Instead of discussing chemistry or optics, he made her read poetry, study 
Picasso, listen to Bach and Verdi, and travel to the countryside and villages. 
A city dweller all her life, those places became her subjects. Iturbide since 
has been honored with some of the most prestigious photography awards of 
Europe, the United States and Latin America; like her mentor's, Iturbide's 
works are exhibited around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Alvarez Bravo's home, bright magenta bougainvillea cascades over the 
garden walls; within its carved doors, a brick ceiling supported by vigas 
arches over a stone floor covered with woven mats. The rooms are lined with 
paintings and photographs, the shelves filled with books and stone antiquities. 
In a turbulent place and era, his life has been relatively placid and remains 
so today. His marriage to Lola, a noted photographer in her own right, gave way 
to a second, to American anthropologist Doris Heydn, who in turn was followed 
by his present wife, French photographer Colette Alvarez Urbajtel. But he has 
been a private man, and his liaisons never became the stuff of legendary 
gossip. Instead, his emotions have always been best divined through his 
painstaking selection of the timeless moments that infuse his work. His most 
unforgettable images illuminate those spaces between dramatic events where life 
truly occurs: a girl suspended in daydream, or cyclists in perfect cadence with 
the visual rhythm of mountains rising around them. 
</P>
<P>
He still labors in his darkroom, assisted by Colette, but at 88 he has forsaken 
traipsing through the landscape for the less taxing, agreeable business of 
mainly photographing female nudes. 
</P>
<P>
"The nude, like death, is a constant," he explains. "It represents life. Life 
and death have intertwined in Mexico's mind since the pre-Hispanic goddess 
Coatlicue, whose breasts give sustenance and whose belt of serpents brings 
doom. She embodies the duality that always accompanies us." 
</P>
<P>
She is among the ancient deities who haunt his images, their names invading his 
titles. Sometimes he has photographed their original stone representations, and 
sometimes he has reincarnated them via his human subjects. In Manuel Alvarez 
Bravo's Mexico, a tradition of artists who interpret the gods to the public 
descends through ornate temple carvings and huge murals to the photographic 
exhibitions so popular in Mexico today. 
</P>
<P>
Few Mexicans can afford to purchase original prints, and making them often 
requires much sacrifice to acquire precious sheets of imported, silver-emulsion 
photo paper. Even though an entire room in Mexico City's Museum of Modern Art 
is dedicated to Alvarez Bravo, the biggest market for his work still exists 
outside the country. But what he began in this intensely visual land, using a 
camera not merely to document beauty but to create it, is now being repeated by 
generations of disciples. No illusions of riches inspire them, only mythic 
surroundings -- surroundings where, as Don Manuel once put it, "I became a 
photographer in search of my own original image." 
</P>
<P>
