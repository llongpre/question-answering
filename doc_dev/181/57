The Egyptian sculpture gallery of the British Museum has been called one of
the great rooms of the world. For the last few weeks 12 artists have had the
run of it, creating work for Time Machine, a collaboration between the
British Museum and the Institute of International Visual Arts. Until the end
of February visitors will discover not only the thrillingly old civilisation
and its relics, but also the links between the ancient and modern worlds
explored by the new works.
For Henry Moore, the Egyptian Gallery was a source of profound inspiration.
Contemplating these magnificent fragments, he realised that it was not size
alone which made sculpture monumental. 'What I found in the Egyptian pieces
was a monumentality of vision.' The craftsmen who gave this vision form
laboured together in a great work of glorification, of their kings and of
their gods. Many devoted their lives to this task; they lived in villages
near the sites of the royal tombs, passed on their positions to their sons,
and were themselves buried in decorated vaults.
At the end of the 20th century, no such supreme vision requires the
subjection of individual craft or skill to a total world view. Instead, we
live in a world of constant questioning, where the boundaries of society
shimmer and shift. The responses of the artists to the challenge set them by
James Putnam, curator in the Egyptian department, who had the idea for the
show, could not have been more varied.
Stephen Cox, for example, has long been devoted to finding and carving the
rare, hard stones favoured by the Pharoahs, and 'Flask' made in 1991, sits
in elegant harmony beneath a statue of King Amenophis 111 of 1400BC. Kate
Whiteford, too, has produced paintings brimming with confidence, finding an
echo of her habitual resonating red and green pigments still visible on the
false door of Ptahshepes, transition point between life and death.
Igor Mitoraj works in a monumental style, his sculptural technique and
images dependent on ancient and classical predecessors but presented with a
questioning, surrealist twist. Marc Quinn has reprised the perspex cast of
his head, which became infamous when filled with his blood, to make a
refrigerated receptacle for a hibernating frog. An Egyptian symbol of birth,
it seems to be snoozing peacefully despite the bright lights and fascinated
onlookers.
Rita Keegan has brought her own family history to set beside that of the
ancient gods, choosing a deity of fertility to guard the video screen on
which images of her mother and father are mixed with those of the Old
Kingdom pair statue of Kaitep and Hetepheres of 2300 BC. David Hiscock takes
us into the world of the supermarket by transforming the Rosetta Stone into
a bar code, and introduces a touch of modern day idol worship by
photographing 'the hands of sculptor Kiki Smith wearing ancient rings.'
These late 1990s symbols of consumerism and fame seem oddly touching among
so much ancient magnificence. Only Alexander Mihaylovich seems to have lost
his head completely in the face of such tough competition. His huge
painting/construction 'Reconstruction' towers above everything else in a
piece of kitsch Las Vegas style scene-stealing which only confirms Moore's
wise words about size.
Present as a photograph only is the installation made from 30 tons of golden
sand which Andy Goldsworthy created specially for the exhibition over one
weekend, but which could not be allowed to remain in a gallery tramped
through by seven million visitors a year. Goldsworthy frequently creates
ephemeral pieces outdoors, which are photographed and left for nature to
reclaim. This time, for those of us lucky enough to see it before its
removal, the snaking golden form brought a symbol of the energy of creation
into the heart of the gallery, drawing the great relics together in its
coils. Its unique setting gave the sand an added dimension. For a few brief
hours, the graven images of the ancient rulers of Egypt, isolated in their
London magnificence, once more lorded over the desert from whence they came.
