The San Diego Museum of Art's exhibition of the work of Chinese artist Li Huai 
stands in stark contrast to the world-shaking events now going on in China. The 
show, officially titled "Li Huai: An Artist in Two Cultures," has nothing to 
offer in the way of grandeur to compete with the real events occurring in that 
vast nation. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it offers what the news does not. It tells the story of an 
individual -- a woman who, at age 34, is of the post-war generation we call 
"baby boomers" -- in whose life and art all the gyrations and perturbations of 
Chinese history have had a profound effect. In fact, the ultimate effect of 
those experiences was that she left China in 1983 to pursue her art career 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The several stunning insights the show offers of her experiences as an artist 
in China come only partly from the more than 60 paintings and drawings on view. 
Much of what's most revealing comes instead from the texts in which the artist 
describes, often at great length, the various works and the contexts in which 
they were produced. From these emerge the record of the often wildly varying 
rules by which the Chinese government has decreed what artists can and cannot 
do. Throughout her life, however, there were always officially decreed rules 
and restrictions of one kind or another, and this is what Li left China to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
Among the earlier works in the exhibit is a group of ink and gouache paintings 
on paper depicting the artist's interpretation of ancient frescoes in four 
Taoist temples she visited in 1980 with classmates from her school, The Beijing 
Film Institute. These images are remarkable to Western eyes in the way they 
capture a sense of spiritual and metaphysical energy; that is, as 
representations of minor gods. For Li, however, what's remarkable is that she 
can actually see such a treasure of the past -- one that hasn't been destroyed 
by the Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly remarkable are several landscape paintings, in gouache on paper, 
which she also produced in 1980. To our eyes, these interpretations of the 
stylistic qualities of Van Gogh and Gauguin may seem unexciting, but for Li, 
exposure to this 100-year-old European work was almost entirely new. And the 
opportunity to work openly in the style without risk of exile to the 
countryside must have seemed especially delicious. 
</P>
<P>
Another odd and nearly amateurish group of works is a series of figures in oil 
paints created from 1979 to 1982. In these, we see the artist delighting in 
being able to depict individuals -- friends, even -- without fear of being 
accused of glorifying individuals at the cost of the group. More importantly, 
though, this was her first opportunity to receive instruction in the use of oil 
paints. As an accompanying text explains, this medium was very new to China and 
was closely identified with the hostile, foreign West. 
</P>
<P>
It's against this background that Li left China for the United States, 
specifically, for Southern California, where she is now a graduate student at 
CalArts in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
The works she has produced here over the past several years suggest the 
struggle she must be experiencing: coming out of the Chinese culture, but 
looking toward establishing a mode of working that isn't necessarily 
Chinese-inspired. A relatively early, but representative, work produced on 
these shores is "The Yellow Wind" from 1985. An oil on canvas, it harks back to 
the gouache on paper paintings she did in the Taoist temples, especially in the 
way the flow of line, in the Taoist originals, seems driven by a combination of 
wind and fire. Finally, the most recent paintings combine text and imagery to 
suggest the discontinuities that prevent people from fully appreciating and 
understanding one another. They're about disjunctions, disconnections and lack 
of communication. In one of these works, a text describing how eating only 
plain rice can be embellished is accompanied by an image of two tightly 
corseted female torsos expounding their love of Mao. 
</P>
<P>
The complexity of these latter images may make one nostalgic for some of the 
simplicity of Li's early, China-born imagery. And there's certainly something 
very attractive about her presentation of the ancient gods whose images she 
encountered after the Cultural Revolution. But this whole situation, in art as 
in the world, is a confusing one. If one likes a little confusion and some 
challenge, this show is rich fare indeed. It's a case where the whole is 
greater than the sum of the parts.
