L.A. EVENTS TO CELEBRATE MEXICAN TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much folk art has its roots in religious and family traditions celebrated by 
members of the artist's community. One of the predominant folk-art traditions 
is Day of the Dead, Dia de Los Muertos, a Nov. 2 Mexican celebration in which 
the family is reunited as the dead return to visit the living. As part of the 
celebrations, deceased relatives are represented in the form of calaveras, 
smiling skeleton figures.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Art Exhibition -- M. H. Smith's exhibition, "Day of the Dead Alter," was 
incorrectly titled "Day of the Dead Altar" in a listing of local events 
celebrating the Mexican tradition in Friday's Calendar. The exhibition, through 
Nov. 12 at USC Atelier in the Santa Monica Place shopping mall, is concerned 
with "change and continuity in Western art traditions," according to the 
artist.
