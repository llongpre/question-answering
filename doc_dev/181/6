galleries participating in this month's festivities

IN THE few years since its inception, Glasgow's Mayfest has become an
important fixture in the British cultural calendar. Natural civic pride and
rivalry apart, it is hardly yet the equal of Edinburgh as an international
festival of the arts, but who would now say, with enthusiasm on the one
side, and complacency on the other, that a full reversal of the relative
positions was impossible?
So far as the visual arts are concerned, the issue is already nicely
balanced. Glasgow may not yet boast the major exhibitions which Edinburgh's
museums have always the good sense to offer at festival time, with the city
full of visitors. But that effort is usually qualified by a wish to distance
it from the Festival as such, opening particular shows well beforehand and
running them on long afterwards. As for the Festival authorities, their
current advance literature is innocent of any reference to the visual arts
at all.
But Mayfest has always integrated the visual element into its programme.
This year there may be no single outstanding offering, but across the
spectrum, from public to private, some 15 galleries are participating, with
all but two of them open by this weekend, and a further eight listed in
association.
To try the flavour, I visited four shows, one of which, at the Collins
Gallery (22 Richmond Street: until June 6), with the opening due on Friday
night, was on Thursday morning but a flurry of carpentry, paint and
wallpaper and a gleam in the artist's eye. 'Access', by Jim Buckley, is to
be an installation that takes further the images he first developed in his
sculpture. This he based on the old peepshow principle, making boxes with
interiors that proposed their own imaginative scale and reality.
Here, in one darkened gold-papered room, Buckley has set into the wall four
large display transparencies taken from the boxes he showed in Kunst Europa
in Germany last year, the images imagined, richly decorated, sanctuary-like
interiors. The other room, white and light, holds seven peepholes through
which to view photographic details of actual architectural interiors found
in the city itself.
Cyril Gerber was the first dealer to bring modern and contemporary art to
Glasgow, and he stands naturally at the heart of Mayfest. At his personal
gallery (148 West Regent Street: until May 23) he shows Benjamin Creme, a
Glaswegian painter now 70 but long neglected. The work here is of the 1940s,
when Creme was taken up by the emigre Polish painters Josef Herman and
Jankel Adler then living in Glasgow, and the 1950s when he was in London and
one of the circle of Minton, MacBryde, Colquhoun and others. The figure
drawings and paintings are especially interesting, sophisticated in their
modernism, after Braque and Matisse, yet direct and personal in feeling and
character.
Up the road at his Compass Gallery (178 West Regent Street: until May 21),
Gerber is showing the recent work of a most distinctive Scottish
print-maker, Elspeth Lamb. With her 'Cornerstones', she offers us the fruit
of a recent visit to Mexico where she was particularly taken both by the
popular festivals of the Day of the Dead and the ancient architectural
carvings and hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza, Teotihuacan and Quetzalcoatl.
But what makes her show remarkable is not so much the imagery as the medium
by which she has developed and quite literally expressed it. Making the
paper herself, saturating the pulp with pigment, she at once simplifies and
concentrates the image while impressing it into the very fabric of her
material. The paper is itself the image: and rich and dense and beautiful
too.
The Transmission Gallery (28 King Street) is a co-operative run by a
changing committee of five artists to show not their own but the work of
artists they would wish to see. Throughout May it offers a group show - a
collaborative relief-cum-lightwork by Paul Maguire and Simon Starling,
consisting of three isometric cubes, small, medium and large, described by
white neon tubes; four cibachrome prints of a leather holster, by Michael
McDonough; and a set of of ironically dispassionate photographs of taped and
sand-bagged windows, taken in Zagreb last November by Donald Urquhart.
Small, black and white, the format insistent in its simple frontality, the
plastic bags oddly disturbing in the way they are heaped and trussed, they
are rather impressive.
