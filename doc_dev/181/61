<LEADPARA>  HE PICTURES the beaming Cream of Wheat chef in a stinging, funny commentary on
the commercialization of racist images and titles it "No More o' This Shit."
He depicts a white skull on a black ground and calls it "Attica is Fascismo."
Then he shows Ruben Salazar, the reporter slain by Los Angeles police who
lobbed a tear-gas grenade into a bar during the Chicano moratorium in 1970.;  
 Rupert Garcia's work has always expressed outrage at current events. From his
beginnings 25 years ago as a producer of protest art fueled by the Vietnam War
and the struggles of Third World peoples, this Bay Area artist's paintings,
posters, screenprints and pastel drawings have evolved from Pop shots into a
forceful, expressive commentary on social and political injustice. And more.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE ART OF PERSUASION
SJS PROFESSOR RUPERT GARCIA GETS A MAJOR
LAUNCHING IN SAN FRANCISCO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Art Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "Rupert Garcia: Prints and Posters, 1967-90" at the California Palace of
the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, offers an opportunity to see 75 posters
and prints by the 49-year-old San Jose State University associate professor of
art, now clearly hitting his stride.;    In 1990 alone, Garcia had four solo
shows and appeared in five group shows. After this exhibit ends its San
Francisco run, it travels to Mexico City, Bellingham, Wash. and Omaha, Neb.;  
 The show comes with a catalog, printed in English and Spanish, that features
essays by multicultural and political art advocate Lucy Lippard as well as
Robert Flynn Johnson, curator of the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts at
the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (from whose collections the work
comes). Any way you cut it, this is a Major Launching.;    A Chicano born in
French Camp, Calif., Garcia's artistic talent dates from his teen-age years. A
decade later, he experimented with printmaking, producing silk-screen posters
during the student strike over Vietnam at San Francisco State University
(where he was enrolled) in 1968. In 1970, Garcia helped found Galeria de la
Raza in San Francisco's Mission district, which was to become an influential
Bay Area center for Latino art.;    From this center, Garcia and others helped
spearhead the wave of Bay Area Chicano art (along with Chicano art from other
locales, primarily Los Angeles and New York) that has been hitting galleries
and museums across the country since the mid-'80s.;    Energetically
chronicling his times, rarely missing an opportunity to tackle newsworthy
issues, Garcia's print and poster messages address everything and everybody:
black power, the Kent State murders, the grape strike and the boycott of
Safeway stores in 1969, Nelson Mandela's imprisonment.;    The sore spot of
imperialism is poked in "Ceylon Tea: Product of European Exploitation!" This
print pictures the elegant Lipton Tea gent, tea cup graciously in hand. It's
one example of corporations (and world powers) projecting a good-guy public
image while profiteering from Third World countries.;    Through his work
Garcia challenges beliefs, prepares the mind for disagreement. It is possible
to produce works of art that affect people's opinions and Garcia can sometimes
accomplish this on a modest, one-to-one basis.;    A strong graphic artist
with a vibrant eye for color, Garcia favors a highly dramatic use of the human
figure. He persuades with uncluttered, attention-getting images rummaged from
mass media attics -- photographs, advertisements, TV, films, all cropped,
chopped and brimming with visual punch.;    I particularly like the way he
handles portraits of artists and others he respects -- Frida Kahlo, Picasso,
Rufino Tamayo, Mother Jones, for instance. Typically, Garcia enlarges the face
to fill the paper. This device, plus vibrant color (burning orange, searing
red, shrieking yellow -- the colors go hot, hotter, hottest) and pared-down,
flat, quickly readable shapes, tend to create powerful larger-than-life
portraits, whatever their size.;    Garcia said a while back that politics
isn't the overriding concern it used to be.;    Now that nearly all artists
have jumped on the political bandwagon and its many variations are merging
into a yawning mass, Garcia is smartly moving in new directions.;    Garcia's
ambitions today range across myth, history, art, culture. Using many
references and pictorial techniques, he covers a broad terrain.;    Though
paintings and pastel drawings are not represented in this show, those familiar
with Garcia's work know he welcomes Manet, winks at Caravaggio, and pays
tribute to other artists. For instance, Garcia's well-known three-panel
painting, "Une Enigme," borrows from Eugene Delacroix's "Liberty Leading the
People," and shows portraits of Fernand Leger and Delacroix flanking a detail
from the famous French painting.;    In a newly finished three-panel painting
hanging in Garcia's studio a month ago, the Oakland artist heaped together
images of the Greek god Apollo, the Trident submarine and a hard-edged red,
yellow and blue striped modernist work.;    This about sums up what Garcia is
trying to cover today: issues of history and art history (ancient and
contemporary), along with politics and social concerns.;    Granted, Garcia
hasn't yet mastered oil painting, so the result is not always satisfying, even
if the work is getting richer in substance. The medium Garcia uses to most
advantage is pastel.;    The hard edges inherent in the silk-screen process
Garcia favors gives his heroic figures an isolated quality. With pastels,
individual strokes blur together into softened forms, and, more to the point,
reveal traces of the human hand, thus warmly endowing the people Garcia
admires with human qualities.;    Several prints in the Legion of Honor
exhibit ("Courbet and the Vendome Column," for instance), taken from earlier
pastels of the same titles, reveal such touches and are the richer for it.;
