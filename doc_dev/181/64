The winter art drought is letting up here and there, with shows of work by 
strong younger artists from Southern California and a group of golden (and 
not-so-golden) oldies from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Guggenheim Gallery at Chapman College is awash in an outpouring of paintings 
and mixed-media constructions by a young Philippine artist, Manuel Ocampo, who 
now lives in Los Angeles. His bizarrely apropos art background consists of 
drawing cartoons for an underground newspaper and copying religious paintings 
for the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
Although reminiscent at times of the folkloric simplicity and outspoken 
personal anguish associated with Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, his art is really 
a different kind of animal. Brash and nervy, it mingles the outer shell of 
passion with a cool, self-conscious inventiveness that shamelessly borrows from 
the history of Western political, religious and avant-garde art. Ocampo's 
central theme is the Philippines' pervasive lack of self-definition, as the 
only country in Southeast Asia that became subject to Western colonialism 
before it had developed its own centralized government or advanced culture. 
</P>
<P>
His images are paintings of imaginary bloody martyrs and violent events, mock 
posters invoking a call to action or an outpouring of despair, still lifes 
suffused with religious imagery and three-dimensional constructions that 
suggest the sorry residue of fantasized scenes of defiance. 
</P>
<P>
These pieces, produced in a bewildering variety of styles, offer a grab bag of 
cathartic ways of coming to terms with the bottled up emotions of a people who 
experienced 333 years of Spanish rule, 48 years of U.S. government, more than 
two decades of dictatorship under Ferdinand Marcos and an ongoing American 
military presence. Many of the works are spuriously dated -- 1917, 1948, 1981 
-- to reinforce the fictive sense of a shared history of personal involvement 
in the country's direction. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Ocampo's pieces include swastikas, which -- along with the gruesomeness 
of some of the imagery -- reportedly have upset some gallery visitors. But the 
swastikas clearly are meant as emblems of oppression, and the bloody scenes 
reflect Catholic folk tradition, political struggle and -- seemingly -- 
self-inflicted psychological wounds. 
</P>
<P>
At Orange Coast College Art Gallery in Costa Mesa, meticulously painted images 
on coolly well-proportioned ceramic sculptures of female figures by Barbara 
Dorris are meditations on the mysteries of internal physical experience -- most 
vividly, the process of conception and the ravaging of the body by disease. 
</P>
<P>
On the cross-section of a woman's torso, a pair of hands perform legerdemain 
with an egg and a towel enclosing a small flame. Deer run down the side of one 
hip. These delicately allusive metaphoric images conjure up both physical event 
and bodily sensation: the initial creation of life and the movements of a fetus 
in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Visitation," the figure is a bust-length woman's figure, sheared off at 
one shoulder. Painted in luminous, matter-of-fact detail on the surface of this 
cross-section are two large green and orange bugs crawling over a lump of earth 
on clean red flagstones just beyond a closed white door. The juxtaposition of 
the well-manicured threshold of a house -- a bastion of security and 
orderliness -- with the quietly persistent rhythms of insect life offers a 
vivid image for the doggedly invasive force of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
A rain of fire falling on an umbrella blown inside-out and ringed with burning 
tapers ("Dermis") is a metaphor for the resilient -- but thin and infinitely 
sensitive -- layers of human skin. The vertically amputated torso figure on 
which this image is painted lists slightly to one side, as if mirroring the 
vulnerability of the human body. For Dorris -- long in possession of an 
effortless technique but in search of meaningful subject matter -- this series 
marks a personal breakthrough in its exquisitely empathic treatment of the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of low-key meditations on ecological themes by Cynthia Kastan and Mary 
Linn Hughes sit comfortably under the umbrella, "The Nature of Things," at BC 
Space in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kastan takes black-and-white aerial photographs of sprawling landscapes in 
various U.S. locations and turns them into photo-silk screens, printed 
off-register (to create a sense of depth) and overlaid with brightly colored 
lines and squiggles. 
</P>
<P>
In the manner of ancient South American earthworks, these patterns turn the 
contours of rivers, valleys and plains into the outlines of grandly scaled 
images and vignettes: a fish, a face, a fanciful creature chasing an antelope. 
The suggestion is that the distance of long-range contemplation reveals a 
spiritual presence that still inhabits our much-beleaguered natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
The margins of some of these pieces also include images of a broad range of 
human and animal life. In "Facets: Stretch," photographs of film actors, a 
bare-chested masked performer, acrobatic monkeys, a creeping lizard and a 
forward-lurching dinosaur skeleton seem to be engaged in a global demonstration 
of the word stretch, as if to indicate the ties that bind the kingdom of the 
animals. It's a worthy idea, and yet one wants the piece to reveal a more 
intricate and sophisticated visual syntax that goes beyond a simple system of 
equivalences. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' untitled installation soothes the senses immediately, with sounds of 
running water and an atmospheric scattering of sharply scented eucalyptus 
leaves on the floor. Crunching through them, the viewer passes an invitingly 
touchable plot of grass, circles a heaped cord of wood in the center of the 
gallery, spots a hanging stuffed bird and a motto framed in chicken bones, and 
finally reads a message chalked across a wall. The message -- which invokes a 
list of famous dead people whose molecules are still circulating in the 
universe -- asks the viewer to consider that "no life is isolated from other 
life." 
</P>
<P>
There are some problems here. Moralizing or lecturing to the viewer is usually 
a sure way for a work of art to commit hara-kiri. The stuffed bird adds an 
unwanted reminder of cliched wildlife art and the bone-framed sentiment ("There 
is no way around the fact that we are involved with each other") is 
embarrassingly over-earnest and redundant. And yet, Hughes has softened and 
seduced the viewer with her tactile, aromatic evocation of the natural world. 
This piece has an undeniable charm, and its simple but grandly significant 
message lingers compellingly in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
LJB Gallery in Newport Beach is walking down memory lane with a bunch of 
paintings and other pieces by some fondly remembered figures from California 
art of the swinging '60s, courtesy of Jackie Stuart, the widow of Los Angeles 
gallery owner David Stuart. Although much of the work seems to have been chosen 
with the flighty tastes of Orange County in mind, and some notable names are 
represented by so-so work, there are a few treats here. 
</P>
<P>
Most generously served is Robert Dowd, whose loopy, wildly oversize paintings 
of American folding money linger lovingly on the ornate seals, the patterned 
intricacies of steel engraving and numismatists' dreams of finding valuable 
printing errors. Not to mention Dowd's fantasies -- to contemporary eyes, 
all-too-prescient -- of a conflation of greenbacks and art, as in "Picasso 
Dollar," in which a Picassoid woman's head replaces George Washington's. 
</P>
<P>
Llyn Foulkes -- like Dowd, an artist whose work was included in Newport Harbor 
Art Museum's "L.A. Pop in the '60s" exhibition last year -- also comes on 
strong. One of his oddly anthropomorphic landscapes, "Ercha's Rock," a large 
image of a craggy outcropping, is paired with a handwritten fragment of prose 
("The rock hung without the man"). The painted frame reinforces the sense that 
this work is a self-conscious artifact of the imagination -- a grand, 
semi-serious parody of the tradition of the Western novel. 
</P>
<P>
John Altoon's untitled watercolor of three figures offers his inimitable 
serendipitous way with jabs, scribbles and rushes of color. Lumbering and 
delicate forms nudge each other in teasing ways, and the color has a joyous, 
springtime feel. William Copley's all-over patterns of tiny figures and jokey 
tete-a-tete ("Now No") still retain a happy-go-lucky appeal. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing else really sings any more. James Strombotne's paintings look glum 
and awkward. The Peter Voulkos pieces are small and tame, compared to the wild, 
galumphing works that set the hitherto tame world of ceramics on its ear. 
Hassel Smith has done many more striking abstract paintings. Could we ever have 
found any substance in Mel Ramos' airbrushed cuties? Did anyone ever take 
Laurence Dreiband's male fantasies of teenie-boppers seriously? What a long 
time ago it was. 
</P>
