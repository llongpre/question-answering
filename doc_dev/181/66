   Terra-cotta works created by artists a millennium ago are
featured in a new exhibit, ``Icons: Ideals and Power in the Art of
Africa,'' at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art in
Washington.
   The exhibition of 125 sculptures, watercolors, oils, etchings
and banners explores the various ways in which various African
societies and civilizations have viewed the icons of mother and
child, male and female, the male, the rider, and the stranger.
   ``Unlike European religious icons that focused on Christian
imagery, these five African symbols represent powerful, shared
cultural ideals and values central to the lives of African
peoples,'' said Andrea Nicholls, assistant curator. ``The ideals
are embodied in the images as attributes of physical beauty, power
or accomplishment in the social, political, religious or economic
realm.''
   The exhibit includes a pair of Yoruba palace doors by the
sculptor Areogun with images of a king and his wives, bicyclists,
colonial clerks, soldiers and equestrians to reflect late 19th
-century Yoruba life.
   ``Icons'' opened Oct. 25 and will run through Sept. 3, 1990.
