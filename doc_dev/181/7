<TEXT>  A  It directs people to Deganawidah Quetzalcoatl University, now known as D-Q
University. It's a small, accredited two-year college with 65 percent of its
300 students American Indians. The college opened in 1971 using the original
name. David Childress, a D-Q spokesman, says Deganawidah is a hero in Indian
culture. He says the Mohawk tribe uses the name in its religious ceremonies
and asked the college not to use it in its name. The school complied in 1977.
Childress says Quetzalcoatl is a South American Indian mythical god of
learning and wisdom. D-Q University is between Winters and Davis in Yolo
County.;    Redeeming value;  Q  Boy, am I miffed. I went to Blockbuster Video
where there was a promotion that said, "Rent three videos and get a free
Subway sandwich." I rented three videos and received a coupon that stated,
"Good for a free 6-inch sandwich excluding double meat and double cheese
sandwiches." The coupon had a picture of a huge sandwich printed on it. I took
it into a Subway location to get my free sandwich and was told the coupon is
only redeemable for sandwiches up to $2.49. A $2.49 sandwich is about equal to
mustard on a bun. The manager refused to fill my order for a six-inch sandwich
(excluding double meat and double cheese). This sure sounds like the old bait
and switch to me. Though it's only a stupid sandwich, I feel consumers should
band together. A coupon should be redeemable for what it says.;    -- Roger
Vance, Santa Clara; A  Agreed, says Scott Abbott, official with Subway
Development Co. Abbott apologizes for the rejection. He says you should have
received a free six-inch sandwich at any participating Subway location,
regardless of whether the sandwich is valued at more than $2.49. You didn't
specify which location you went to, so he's not sure if you went to a
participating spot. Abbott is making sure all franchise owners are aware that
people with those Blockbuster coupons are supposed to receive a free sandwich.
He says the $2.49 value was supposed to be a guide and Blockbuster had
requested a value be printed on the coupons. Abbott is sending you a coupon
for a free sandwich compliments of Subway Development Co.;    Call for help; 
Q  I purchased a Pac Tel phone, model FE 5150. It was missing the wall/desk
mounting bracket. I have been trying to call the toll-free 800 number printed
on the instruction sheet. I get either a recording a busy signal but have
never been able to talk to a customer-service rep. I really need the bracket.;
   -- C. Alvarez, San Jose; A  The bracket is being shipped to you now, says
Amy Damianakes of Pac Tel Corp. Damianakes says Pac Tel sold the telephone
line a few years back to a company that wasn't ready to handle the volume of
sales. She says the reason you had trouble getting through to the toll-free
number was that the company didn't have a customer-service department until
recently. Damianakes did secure the mounting bracket and is making sure you
get it.  </TEXT>
