Candice Ocampo calls her work eccentric -- she turns lead, steel and copper 
into art. Shirley Shabazian paints mainstream portraits with water colors, oils 
and pastels. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, each will have a new home for the creations -- the Lankershim Arts Center 
in North Hollywood, which opens June 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has a chance to be a place for a lot of avant-garde people," said 
Ocampo. "It's a great space." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shabazian: "It's open to everyone, which makes it so feasible for those 
who live in the Valley. We won't have to go over the hill to get things on 
display." 
</P>
<P>
According to Earl Sherburn, the center's director, that's exactly what the city 
of Los Angeles had in mind -- an outlet for unconventional and mainstream 
artists, away from the pockets of galleries and centers downtown and on the 
Westside. The Lankershim center becomes only the second such facility in the 
San Fernando Valley; the other is the McGroarty Cultural Arts Center in 
Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have a presence in the neighborhoods," Sherburn said. "Eventually, 
we'd like to have a center like this in every one of the council members' 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
The center will feature classes in visual and performing arts, and 2,800 square 
feet of gallery space. The main floor, Sherburn said, will be used primarily 
for art exhibitions, but can be easily converted for music, dance and theater 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
The center will be housed in the two-story former city Department of Water and 
Power building at 5108 Lankershim Blvd., which, by virtue of its 1930s Art Deco 
architecture, was declared a cultural monument by the city's Cultural Heritage 
Commission in 1980. The building has been vacant since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Where McGroarty has been used more for visual arts," said Sherburn, "we think 
this area lends itself more to performing arts." He said he already has been 
contacted by theater and dance companies eager to display their work at the 
center, and he expects to hold small film festivals in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are also under way to find about 25 part-time instructors and one 
full-time teacher for classes in painting, drawing and other visual arts. The 
classes will cost $1.50 per hour for senior citizens and children, $2 for 
others. 
</P>
<P>
In the second phase of remodeling, the city hopes to open a 99-seat theater, 
office space and extra classrooms on the building's second floor. Sherburn said 
the Cultural Affairs Department will probably ask for $200,000 from the city's 
Capital Improvements Fund for the top-floor renovation. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the second phase would begin in July, and could be finished by the 
end of 1990. Sherburn said he is waiting for a final estimate from an architect 
before requesting the new funds. The city allocated $175,000 for work on the 
main floor. 
</P>
<P>
The center was scheduled to open last winter, but remodeling problems forced 
delays. Sherburn said a public support group, the Friends of Lankershim Arts 
Center, will help bring exhibits to the facility, and do a lot of volunteer 
work. Already, 500 names appear on the group's mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which is close to a senior citizens apartment complex and an 
elementary school, will serve as a neighborhood information center. "We'll help 
people with how to get grants, where to go set up exhibits, everything," 
Sherburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Artists aren't wasting any time. 
</P>
<P>
"I just requested a monthlong show," said B. Lorraine Strieby, president of the 
175-member San Fernando Valley Art Club. "This is a great opportunity for 
people in the Valley. I know a lot of people in the club are going to love 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Leona Rhodef, who works with graphics, oil, and acrylics, sees the center as 
much more than gallery space. "It will be great to exchange ideas with other 
artists," Rhodef said. "That can only help our art." 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the center's opening, a weekend of entertainment has been 
scheduled, including performances by the Whirling Winds Trio, the Azuma Sumako 
School of Japanese Classical Dance, and the Dolcian Singers. A new version of 
"Frankenstein" will be presented June 15 by Frankly Speaking Productions. 
</P>
<P>
An international art exhibition, opening June 17 and continuing through July 
20, will feature artists from Los Angeles and Mexico City. Artwork by selected 
Mexican artists will also be on loan to the center from the Lodi Gallery in 
Pasadena.
