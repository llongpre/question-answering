   What could easily be one of only operas ever
performed in ancient langauge of the Aztecs will be staged at the
Pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico.
   Tenor Placido Domingo, singing in Nauhatl, will star in the
premiere of Lalo Schifrin's ``Songs of the Aztecs'' on the stone
stage of the Square of the Moon, built centuries ago by ancient
Meso-Americans.
   Schifrin will conduct the Mexico Philharmonic at the Oct. 29
event, a benefit to launch a campaign for the restoration of the
Aztec Temple of Teotihuacan, an hour's drive from Mexico City.
American Express has pledged $100,000 toward the restoration.
   The composer said doing an opera in Nauhatl was not a serious
problem. ``The chorus and singers are used to the phonetics of a
foreign language,'' he said.
   ``I thought it would be better to do it in the original language.
With a translation, the use of a dictionary and grammar, I was able
to work it out. Chocolatl was a secret drink of the Aztecs. We say
chocolate. Our word coyote comes from their coyotetl.''
   He was helped by a Nauhatl authority, Dr. Georges Beaudo of the
University of Toulouse in France.
   Schifrin wrote the music after finding some pre-Columbian poetry,
in Spanish, by Nezahualcoyotl (1432-72).
   ``(It) was so beautiful I decided to use it,'' he said. ``The
last line of the poem is, `It cannot be in vain why we come to this
Earth; let us leave some flowers; let us leave some songs.'''
   For the Oct. 29 performance, 10,000 chairs will be set up, a new
sound system built and TV screens put in to provide subtitles in
Spanish and English. ``We're trying to make some of the prices very
popular,'' he said. ``A thousand people are going to pay very, very
high prices. I cannot tell you how much money it takes to preseve
something that is very important. ... To know where we're coming
from is going to help us to know where we're going.''
   The pyramids at Teotihuacan date from 100 B.C. to 100 A.D.
   The site of the concert, Schifrin said, is in the City of the
Gods in a square of stone, the Square of the Moon.
   ``The square is raised; it's exactly the place for the full
symphony, full chorus, soloists and conductor, where musicians used
to play 500 years ago,'' he said. ``It was a stage; they built it
for us. Along a stone avenue are ruins of temples and stairways. The
whole place looks very impressive. We go to Greece and Rome to find
architectural riches but we have it right here.''
   That Schifrin is the composer of so esoteric a work may surprise
those who know him either from his jazz days with Dizzy Gillespie or
as a composer of more than 80 film and TV scores.
   Schifrin, who is 56, was born in Buenos Aires, where his father
was concertmaster of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic. He studied
composition and piano at the Paris Conservatory, and returned to
Buenos Aires where he became a composer, arranger, conductor and
pianist, in pop, jazz and classical music.
   ``I've seen opera since I was a child. I had a dramatic instinct.
This is probably one of the first times I'm saying this openly but I
think movies are the opera of today,'' he said.
   ``In `The Cincinnati Kid,' where I had Ray Charles playing along
with a symphony orchestra, it was not pop music. This was really
serious music _ to me, and I think to many people.
   ``The score of `Bullitt' is being played by symphony orchestras
now. I did an arrangement of symphonic sketches from the score of
`Cool Hand Luke.'''
   He moved to the United States in 1958 and played piano in
Gillespie's quintet from 1960-62. He composed ``Gillespiana Suite''
for the first record he on which he played with Dizzy.
   ``Many people think I went to Hollywood to make money,'' she
said. ``I didn't have any idea about how much money I was going to
make. There is a group of composers in New York and there is no
outlet to play their music. Duke Ellington was the only example
since Haydn to have his own orchestra to play his own music. The
reason I went to Hollywood was, there was an outlet for hearing your
music you composed.''
   Lately, he has done less film composing and more conducting. Last
December, he became music director of the Paris Philharmonic. Their
first recording together, Ravel's ``Mother Goose,'' Stravinsky's
``Petrushka'' and Schifrin's double bass concerto with soloist Gary
Karr, is being released this fall.
   ``I think music is to be shared, and not only through mechanical
means like records. You can be in a theater or even a stadium, doing
something for several thousand people. That is very thrilling.''
