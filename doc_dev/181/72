<LEADPARA>  I ENJOYED the July 7 Travel section very much, especially the articles about
the Columbus voyage of discovery.;    However, I must advise you that the
account of the voyages by Friar Bartolome de las Casas has long since been
discredited as a propaganda effort to undermine Columbus' claims against the
crown of Spain.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The writings of de las Casas properly belong with that genre of literature
which also includes the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other notable
works written with political or economic motives to discredit one or another
person or group.;    Frankly, I am shocked that works by Hans Koning and
Kirkpatrick Sale would be treated as solid bases for analysis or reporting. I
am sure that both have one or another hidden agenda, and one that serves to
demean Latino Americans, and to rip away from Latinos and Latinas their
respect for their ancestors.;    I hope you will be able to do a balanced
piece that reports on the ways that old-fashioned slander in the 1400s and
1500s influences our views today.; Dale Warner; Secretary,; European American
Study Group; San Jose;  HISTORY LESSONS;  I WOULD like to commend Nora
Villagran on her story ("It's 'not my party': Storm brews over '92
celebration") in the July 7 Travel section. As a professor of social science
at San Jose State University, I recognize the importance of providing a
history that is accurate and unbiased.;    Unfortunately the curricula and
textbooks in our schools distort the facts of history to the extent that the
citizens of the United States will unknowingly celebrate not the "discovery"
of a new land, but rather the inception of one of the most brutal cases of
mass genocide ever committed against humankind.;    Educational historians
have shown that Benjamin Rush and Daniel Webster, two of the "fathers" of our
educational system, made a conscious decision to delete facts that may not
have contributed to the development of a patriotic citizenry during their
"Americanization," or rather, homogenization movement.;    Our schools
continue in the original tradition, feeding students one version of history,
resulting in linear-thinking, non-critical, non-analytical college adults. I
deal with them every semester in the classroom. I will use Villagran's
insightful and well-researched article in my classes.; Maria Luisa Alaniz; San
Jose;  Look to the future; AS THE quincentennial of the famous Columbus voyage
of 1492 draws near, there are some who claim this is no reason to celebrate.
Nora Villagran is quick to point out negative aspects of the Spanish arrival
in the Americas (July 7 Travel section).;    But as the Villagran article
progresses and various historians are quoted, the scope of the argument
broadens, addressing the entire issue of the European "conquest" of the
Americas. Most of the historians cited paint a picture of innocent indigenous
peoples exploited by evil colonizing Europeans.;    But is this assessment
fair in the light of historical perspective?;    I would like to cite the
legacy of the Aztecs in Mexico. Historians agree that the Aztecs' empire grew
by subjugating their less powerful neighbors and compelling them to pay
tribute. They took prisoners of war and subjected them to unthinkable torture.
They also participated in ritual cannibalism.;    Yet in Mexico and in many
parts of the United States, the Aztecs are generally held in high regard by
Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who look to their ancestors for cultural
identity.;    For example, Aztec ritual dances are regularly performed at
celebrations, and the calendar of the Aztecs is proudly displayed in homes and
offices. How is it that the atrocities of these indigenous people (Aztecs) are
overlooked and their accomplishments are admired, often by the very same
individuals who are clamoring to lay a heavy guilt trip on those who choose to
commemorate the voyage of Columbus?;    The significance of Columbus' voyage
was that it marked the beginning of the most profound change ever to occur in
the history of the people of the Western hemisphere. This change continues in
our day. La Raza, the new race created by the blending of Indian and Caucasian
blood, makes up the majority of the population in Mexico, Central and South
America. In the United States this group is the fastest growing minority. Can
we deny this blending of cultures is anything less than destiny? In Mexico and
many other parts of Latin America, Oct. 12 is not called Columbus Day, but Dia
de la Raza, which more accurately addresses the significance of the famous
encounter.;    Columbus Day should provide an opportunity for us not to point
fingers, but to search for positive results of the cultural phenomena that
have occured in the Americas in past 500 years and to reflect on where we are
heading.; Mark Van Den Broeke; King City;  Don't slander Columbus;  IT IS
quite a flattering event when all the different ethnic groups claim
Christopher Columbus as their own son but in the same breath slander him. I
ask myself how can a person claiming to be rational make such an unintelligent
judgment?;    In my opinion, Christopher Columbus is the greatest sailor of
all centuries. The Italian/American community has brought the spotlight
rightfully on this great mariner.;    If diverse ethnic groups feel they must
protest (against Columbus) then let them pick another day and not infringe
upon the rights of others to exercise the constitutional rights to free
assembly and speech.;    If they must parade in feathers and shoot arrows and
place Hitler's statue alongside Christopher Columbus, are they not honoring
Adolph Hitler? I hope these diverse ethnics will come to their senses and
respect the Constitution -- perhaps they will discover that the greatest of
documents has permitted them to parade in feathers and shoot their arrows.;
Cesare S. Claudio;  Santa Clara;  A Karlsbad disagreement;   I WOULD like to
comment on just one absurd statement made in the July 14 Travel section.;    I
am fascinated by the historical discovery of Egon Donner that there were no
Czechs ever in Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia) before 1945. He must
have access to some yet-unpublished archives of Konrad Henlein or perhaps
someone higher up.;    To the lonely tourist with the interest in history I
suggest walking into any cemetery in a 30-mile perimeter and count the
headstones older than 1939, separately, those with Czech and German names.
Then draw your own conclusion.; Herman Aster,; San Jose  </TEXT>
