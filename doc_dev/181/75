   In 1936, the photographer Walker Evans worked with author James
Agee in Hale County, Ala., preparing an article on sharecropping
that later became their book ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men''
(1941).
   Artist Williams Christenberry was greatly influenced by the book
as a University of Alabama graduate student in 1960, and he began
photographing Hale County buildings and countryside primarily as
studies for his paintings.
   Evans and Christenberry met in 1961 and returned to Hale County
together in 1973.
   Photographs the two artists made in Hale County over a 50-year
period will be on display at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth,
Texas, from April 27 to June 24.
   Following its run at the Amon Carter, ``Of Time and Place:
Walker Evans and Williams Christenberry'' will travel to the
Wichita Art Museum, Kansas, Dec. 1, 1990-Jan. 20, 1991; the
Portland Museum of Art, Maine, Feb. 17-April 14, 1991; and the
Friends of Photography, San Francisco, July 2-Sept. 9, 1991.
