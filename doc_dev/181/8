<TEXT>     And a good thing too.;   Bibliophiles and art lovers have a treat in a show
that speaks volumes at the Cal State Hayward art gallery. Under the guest
curatorship of Judith Hoffberg of Pasadena, 140 contemporary artists have
contributed works for "Cross Currents: Bookworks from the Edge of the
Pacific.";   There's a whole category of art that takes its inspiration from
the idea of the book. In this show, some creations barely touch base with the
book notion before whirling off into metaphor. Some "books" are pages strung
on lines, the individual sheets revealing as much as personal laundry hung
out.;   Others flip open like a child's toy, fan out in accordion pleats or
are folded to represent the sail shapes of the Sydney (Australia) Opera House.
You'll find book as political statement, book as intimate personal journey.
The book as object -- say, decorative books in model homes -- is represented
by bricks stamped like book bindings.;   "There's lots of energy here," said
Lew Carson, gallery director, noting the contrast between high- and low-tech
works. The printing technology ranges from hand lettering and wood blocks to
Xerox and laser prints. Covers are stamped leather, carved wood, handmade
papers.;   Some of the volumes are fragile, but the show is color coded with
dots marking which books may be opened by the viewer and which should be taken
to the attendant. The curator has thoughtfully provided 100 sets of white
cotton gloves for handling the books.;   Thirteen countries are represented in
the show. The rich mix includes a Russian artist living in Seattle, a Czech in
Australia, a Chinese artist living in the United States who must exhibit
anonymously for safety reasons. Artists living on the Pacific Rim have a
different sensibility from those in New York, Hoffberg believes. In the
introductory statement, she writes: "There is something deeply spiritual about
the Pacific Rim; it is as if the spirals uncoiled, joining us all to each
other, with a binding that is not tight, but which loosely affects us all.";  
The book show is to be read at many levels. The Chinese political piece, "A
Page in History, 1989," depicts events surrounding the Tiananmen Square
massacre. The images are recorded as black and white photocopied news photos
spread on a scroll of rice paper evoking the sense of a roll of film
unfolding.;   Among the visual treats are Michael Tuffery's wooden cover with
carved tortoise, lizard and crab and Sonya Rapoport's "Chinese Connection," a
string of bright illustrations and commentary on how the mind and eye work.
Ismael Vargas' feathery Mexican stand-up piece "Quetzalcoatl in New York"
leads the eye right to the bright pop and religious images of "La Bomba" by
Ecuadoran artist Marco Alvarado Lopez.;   Barbara Pucci's small book "Janson:
His Story" is a commentary on the author of the best-known college art history
text, infamous for ignoring women. Among pages of her own illustrations and
text on art history, the artist has inserted blank pages inscribed with such
statements as, "About women from classical Greece, Janson says: Nothing." And
so on through the great ages of art, Janson continues to say: "Nothing.";  
The show is one vast reading room of commentary within commentary. Having
begun in Santa Barbara, it continues through Oct. 25 at Cal State, then moves
to Florida, Australia and Japan.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Gallery hours are
Monday through Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Thursday, 1 to 7 p.m., Saturday,
1 to 4 p.m. Closed Friday and Sunday. The gallery is on the first floor of the
Arts and Education Building of the Cal State Hayward campus. For information,
