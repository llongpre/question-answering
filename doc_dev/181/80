   More than 750 objects never intended for a museum gallery are
being displayed at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis as part of
the ``Graphic Design in America'' show that opened Nov. 5 and will
travel to New York, Phoenix and London after its debut.
   The magazines, newspapers and maps; banners, buttons and flags;
film and television clips; posters, signs and symbols; and trinkets
from Andrew Jackson's presidential campaign, the 1939 World's Fair
and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics were designed to make a quick
impact before being discarded.
   ``Graphic design deals with information that's not meant to be
preserved forever, except if it's in books,'' said Walker design
curator Mildred Friedman, who organized the show.
   ``There hadn't been a big museum show of graphic design before
this, and now that I've done it, I understand why. So much is gone.
It disappears like the winds.''
   Once traffic signs, billboards, advertisements, posters, postage
stamps, record jackets, film and television titles have served
their purpose, they are dumped in the trash. Nevertheless, graphic
design is the world's most pervasive art form, shaping the visual
environment of the world.
   ``Graphic Design in America'' is divided into three thematic
sections _ design in the urban environment, including everything
from maps and trademarks to the World's Fair and Olympics;
mass-media design, ranging from newspapers and magazines to books
and film graphics; and design for government and commerce.
   The show, which includes design developments since 1829 in items
on loan from nearly 100 individuals and institutions, will remain
on view in Minneapolis through Jan. 21.
   Here is a list of other shows at some museums and galleries in
