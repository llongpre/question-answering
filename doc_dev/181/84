   Murthada Haddad, one of Iraq's emerging
sculptors, spent six years fighting the Iranians in the gulf war,
and the horrors he and other artists experienced at the front have
had a dramatic impact on Iraqi art.
   ``I saw too many people die in the war and they come out in my
work. It was a very, very painful experience,'' said Haddad, who
lost his studio and foundry in the southern port of Basra when it
took a direct hit from Iranian shellfire during fierce assaults on
the city.
   Six months after the August cease-fire, there are few signs of
the conflict on the streets of Baghdad. But the battle scars are
visible in the capital's museums, galleries and studios.
   Gone are the idyllic landscapes, the bedouins on horseback, the
scenes from the marshes and the mountains _ all traditional
subjects artists favored before the war began in September 1980. In
their place are searing sculptures and paintings that reflect the
carnage the artists witnessed.
   Three sculptures by Haddad, displayed at a recent one-man
exhibition, show small, bronze figures sitting twisted and bound,
covering their faces. The group is called ``Prisoner of War.''
   A statue commemmorating a missile attack was designed by
Muhammed Ghani, whose whimsical statues inspired by the legend of
``1,001 Nights'' are Baghdad landmarks. A girl in the statue has
two shattered stumps for legs.
   A painting entitled ``War and Peace,'' which won plastic surgeon
Ala Hussein Bashiir the gold medal at the Baghdad International
Festival, shows a man leaving the cold, metallic bonds of his
military uniform to float among the clouds.
   ``The war turned the work of most Iraqi artists into art that
has something to say, not art for decoration,'' the 50-year-old
Bashiir said in an interview. ``They may use the same style, but
the subject has changed.''
   Painter Shakir Hassan, 64, remembers his first visit to the
front after a fierce battle. ``When I saw Basra and the front lines
I understood the dramatic results of war.
   ``When the town itself is burned by bombardment. It means the
existence of things is destroyed _ not just humans, but walls,
paintings as well.''
   One side of his pyramid painting, ``Al-Faw,'' created after the
Iraqi army recaptured the strategic southern peninsula in April
1988 after two years of Iranian occupation, is filled with brightly
colored triangles and squares.
   ``I was using the cultural symbols from Arab and Islamic art,
like old wall decorations from mosques, to represent the strength
of the culture,'' he said. ``Rebuilding them means peace.''
   Artists and critics expect more powerful work to emerge once
artists in the 1 million-strong army Iraq still keeps in the field
get back to their easels.
   ``In the past, the school that was dominant in Iraqi art was the
calligraphy school,'' said prominent critic Jabra Ibrahim Jabra.
``With the war, there was a reaction against that.
   ``The younger artists are very powerful in their statements,
using rough colors, a lot of paint, taking a lot of liberty with
the canvas. They're trying to say something very personal and very
agonized.''
   One strong theme that has emerged in the war-influenced art is
the enduring legacy of the civilizations that prospered along the
Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Artists said 5,000 years of history in
the region was a source of inspiration against the onslaught by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's army.
   ``We have an ancient civilization,'' Ghani said. ``Islam is
relatively young. It's only been here for the past 1,400 years.
Khomeini wanted humanity to go backwards and we didn't want to go
backwards.''
   Haddad used a group of people inspired by ancient Mespotamian
wall reliefs to show the shock induced by the fall of Faw in 1986.
The bearded figures stare off in the distance, mouths agape, hands
crossed over their stomachs.
   Iraqi artists point to the generous checks the government
continued handing out during the war as another important
wellspring of their work.
   ``Our public isn't quite like the public in New York and Los
Angeles in that it wants to acquire paintings for prestige,'' said
Jabra. ``That's coming, but not yet.''
   Culture and Information Minister Latif Nisayyif Jasim visits
most exhibitions, and any artist who has had a one-man show is
eligible for government commissions.
   Everything from the massive new Basra airport to conference
rooms at the state oil marketing authority are hung with original
artwork.
   A gold medal at Baghdad's international exhibition carried a
$15,000 prize. While travel abroad is banned for most Iraqis,
artists are allowed to leave to organize exhibitions of their work.
   The government has realized that giving artists a free hand was
an ``indication of the vitality of the nation,'' Jabra said.
   ``Most Iraqi artists are very well-to-do,'' joked Bashiir, who
is getting government support to organize a fall showing of his
work at the Institute du Monde Arabe in Paris. ``They earn 10 times
more than doctors.''
   President Saddam Hussein is known for ruthlessly eliminating his
enemies, and the state-run press is heavily censored. Still,
artists stress that they have a free hand in their work. But with a
limited private market, official tastes tend to dominate and
artists generally laud the government's tough standards in
selecting the works they commission.
   Part of the quality comes from the country's highly competitive
art colleges.
   The crude nature of some of the statues emerging from the war
has been condemned. In Basra, for example, a massive statue on a
freeway interchange shows an Iraqi infantryman brandishing a sword
after chopping open the neck of a massive ``Iranian shark.''
   ``Very few of us are very happy with our public monuments,''
Jabra said. However, he added, ``the arts are flourishing. It's
miraculous.''
