The Irvine Fine Arts Center will do its bit for a positive global warming 
Saturday with Family International Day '90, a free festival designed to boost 
cross-cultural coziness through the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Themed "Creating a Better World Together," the inaugural event will expose 
families to performing, visual and culinary arts from nations around the world 
through shows, demonstrations and hands-on workshops. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., 
children, parents and grandparents can work side by side on Scandinavian 
quilts, catch a demonstration of Mexican straw paintings, see a Japanese folk 
tale come to life or nibble on traditional Thai food in and around IFAC's 
Heritage Park facility. 
</P>
<P>
"This time of year, everything is Christmas, Christmas, Christmas. . . . It 
seems everything is Christian-oriented," said Cathi Decker, special events 
coordinator for Irvine's Cultural Affairs Department, which is sponsoring the 
festival. "We recognized that there's a great diversity of cultures in Irvine 
and the surrounding cities, so we wanted to create an event that would give 
people a better appreciation of other cultures' traditions and art forms. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, the holidays are always so hectic; families are scattered all over the 
place. This gives them a chance to regroup and enjoy time together." 
</P>
<P>
At two hands-on workshops, families can work together on their own Chinese 
brush painting or Scandinavian-style quilt under the direction of two local 
artists. Participation in the two-hour workshops is open to everyone from 
"Grandma to preschoolers," Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer watching to doing, local artists representing six 
different cultures will demonstrate Thai silk-flower making, Mexican straw 
painting, Chinese calligraphy and other regional arts and crafts throughout the 
day. Orranard Intarajit, an IFAC culinary arts instructor, will create and sell 
a variety of Thai specialties, including pad Thai (fried noodles with chicken, 
dried shrimp and peanuts) and tod man (fried fish cakes). International holiday 
baked goods such as Swedish spice cookies, Caribbean-style banana bread and 
German gingerbread will also be sold. 
</P>
<P>
The day's entertainment begins at noon on IFAC's lakeside patio with a 
performance by the South Coast Chinese Culture Assn.'s Little Panda Chorus. 
Ranging in age from 6 to 12, the 35 boys and girls will present a 20-minute 
program of Chinese folk songs and contemporary American tunes. Also fea tured 
that day will be the children's troupe, We Tell Stories. Appearing in 
conjunction with the Irvine Arts Festival, a six-month series of free 
performances and exhibits, the Los Angeles-based children's troupe will present 
"Proud to Be Me," a theatrical lesson in the importance of self-worth through 
the telling of three multicultural folk tales: "John Henry," which celebrates 
the accomplishments of a black folk hero of the late 1800s; "The Burro and the 
Bee," a Mexican legend about the perils of false pride, and "The Two 
Stonecutters," a Japanese story about the dangers of being dissatisfied with 
your lot in life. Students from the Irvine-based Wan Hua Dance Studio will 
complete the lineup with a selection of traditional Chinese folk dances. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the workshops and performances, participants will be invited to 
tour IFAC's current gallery exhibition, "Who I Am Not," a collection of 
photographs and multimedia works intended to dispel stereotypical views of the 
homeless. Artists represented in "Who I Am Not" and companion exhibits include 
residents of the Santa Ana Civic Center, as well as area high school and 
elementary school students.
