THE quincentenary of Columbus's landfall in America has been the source of
considerable soul searching in the US. While mainstream Mr and Ms America
may be happy to celebrate Europe's Transatlantic leap, the original new
worlders (not to mention the watchdogs of political correctness) are
demanding apologies and penance for the devastation which the 'white gods'
from the east wrought on the indigeous peoples they encountered.
There is then a timeliness in The Art of Ancient Mexico, a fascinating and
worthy celebration of the arts of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs and other
cultures which dominated Mesoamerica for some 3,000 years before the arrival
of the Spanish. The works have been assembled from the major public
collections of Mexico, judiciously supplemented by the British Museum
(Museum of Mankind).
It has been over 20 years since the last major exhibition of ancient Mexican
art in London, and an innocent eye is in this case not a bad way to confront
cultures at once so alien and yet visually accessible. By eliciting
reactions we normally expect only from modern western art, Precolumbian art
stoutly refuses to be approached in a narrowly archaeological or even
historical mindset.
A palma of Brancusi-like simplicity and elegance demands to be admired as
pure form, despite its presumed religious or practical function. A Totonac
sculptor carves a head in which only one half of the face is shown, the
other half left undefined and emerging from its stone casing. It is all one
can do to resist images of Michelangelo's bound figures in the Louvre. The
Chac Mool reclining on his elbows, was so thoroughly imbibed by Moore that
it seems here strangely familiar and modern. So too the Huastec sculptures
and a Veracruz jaguar mask which have a futuristic primitivism that is pure
Star Wars. Mexico can surely boast some of the most alien of all human art
and it is no accident that Eric von Daniken found here so much fodder for
his extra terrestrial dreamings.
Mayan art, widely regarded as the high-point of the Precolumbian
achievement, took the decorative and iconographic principles established by
the Olmecs in the centuries before Christ to a new level of delicacy and
refinement. Jaina ceramic figurines of a women, priests and warriors are
exquisite genre studies whose faces are to be seen all over the Yucatan to
this day. Jade was exploited to lavish effect in relief carvings and, most
spectacularly, in human masks. The so-called 'eccentric flints', fashioned
by knapping the brittle stone with extraordinary skill into bizarre forms,
remain something of an enigma. Disappointingly, there is not a single piece
of 'narrative style' Mayan pottery, in which the native American's show a
remarkable facility for two-dimensional naturalism - an unexpected foil to
the mainstream spirit of strict iconographical formalism.
One surprise is the virtual silence in which the exhibition passes over the
revolution currently taking place in Mayan studies from the decipherment of
the Mayan hieroglyphic script. Since the script is itself a pictorial code
whose understanding is intimately linked to the symbolism of Mayan art, this
new insight lifts a veil from Mayan iconography too. As in Egypt, much
ancient Mexican art needs to be deciphered in as precise and literal a way
as writing. The more official and ceremonial pieces are interspersed with
pottery and other items of everyday use, including rare wood-carvings. These
are much more spontaneous and imaginative, showing the exuberance of the
household or village craft tradition. In the human- and animal-shaped
vessels of the Colima potters lies a virtual menagerie of local wildlife and
domestic scenes - a baby, an emaciated hunchback, an acrobat - keenly
observed with real sympathy and inventively adapted to shapes that can also
function as vessels.
The show has been laid out with a keen eye for design and lighting, with
adequate wall tests including evocative quotations from ancient Mexican
texts. The designers have made the most of an awkward ramp at the entrance
by arranging a series of intimidating Huastec statues in sentry-like rows.
The layout of material is by regions, which only partly correspond to the
major cultural entities (Olmec, Maya, Aztec etc.) and cuts across both media
and periods. No system is perfect but this is a half-way measure which fully
serves neither an archaeological nor an artistic end.
The handsome catalogue is itself no small design achievement whose superb
illustrations provide much food for further thought and admiration. Alas the
text - a direct translation of the Spanish version - is rather idiosyncratic
in its selection of themes and suffers from the user-unfriendly focus of
academics. The short bibliography ignores most of the major English-language
studies.
The gold which fuelled the Conquistadores ravages is conspicuoulsy absent
from The Art of Mexico. This is only partly the result of the mindless orgy
in which the finest handiwork of the American goldsmiths was consigned
wholesale to the melting pot by the Spanish invaders. Unlike their South
American contemporaries, the Classic and earlier cultures of Mesoamerica did
not much value the yellow metal, importing it from the south only sparingly.
The Hayward show rightly avoids any hint of gold lust, focusing instead on
the myriad other artictic achievements of these most ill-fated of peoples.
