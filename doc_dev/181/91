As in most fields, women artists have a more difficult time "making it" than 
men artists, and the problem is compounded for those of Latino descent. But a 
show opening Saturday at Loyola Marymount's Laband Art Gallery is chipping away 
at that problem. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Image and Identity: Recent Chicana Art from 'La Reina del Pueblo de Los 
Angeles de la Porcincula,' " the exhibit features works by five women of 
Mexican heritage. The group complains that Chicana artists have been virtually 
passed over by major Latino art shows, including "Hispanic Art in the United 
States" at the L.A. County Museum of Art in early 1989; the recent European 
traveling show "Le Demon des Anges"; and to a lesser extent, "Chicano Art: 
Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-85," which opened last weekend at UCLA's Wight 
Art Gallery.

"There have definitely been omissions, and this show will help (to make up for) 
a lot of those glaring ones that have happened recently," said Sybil Venegas, 
curator of the exhibit, which includes five or six works each by photographer 
Laura Aguilar and painters Barbara Carrasco, Diane Gamboa, Margaret Garcia and 
Dolores Guerrero-Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to racism and sexism, said the women of "Image and Identity," there 
are several possible reasons for their difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia noted that women artists often deal with more personal, introspective 
themes, and therefore may create work seen as "less universal." Carrasco said 
Chicana artists addressed more political themes than men, which goes against 
the current trend of what she called "stereotypical" Chicano art. Gamboa 
believes women artists lack the camaraderie prevalent among men, and 
Guerrero-Cruz said that many women can't produce a large enough body of work 
because of such additional concerns as raising families. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times there is an underlying sexism that assumes that somehow men are 
more competent, and then (Chicanas) are put down on a cultural level as well," 
said curator Venegas, who teaches Chicana and Mexican art history at East L.A. 
College and Cal State Long Beach. "Mexican females are really outside of the 
mainstream. Any one of these women could have been included in 'Hispanic Art in 
the United States.' " 
</P>
<P>
In that show, Venegas said, only 3 of 29 artists were women. In three other 
recent Latino shows, women account for 20% to 29% of the artists: "Le Demon des 
Anges" had four women in a pool of 20, "CARA," has 41 women out of 169 artists, 
and four women are among the 14 in "Aqui y Alla," running at L.A. Municipal Art 
Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been excluded from a lot of the other shows, and the odds are against 
us in many ways as women," Gamboa said. "It's real obvious and hard to 
overcome, but it's important for the few of us that are doing it to stick with 
it. This show will help us do that." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero-Cruz agreed. "I am a woman and a Chicana -- which gives me two 
strikes. But I think our time has come. It's only recently that we've been 
complaining about it and have been able to start showing our works. This is the 
first Chicana show in which we have a large body of work that gives an accurate 
description of what we can actually do." 
</P>
<P>
There have been other Chicana shows, Venegas pointed out, but they have mostly 
been held at smaller, less respected community galleries. The last Chicana show 
in Los Angeles, she said, was in 1983 at SPARC Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Something is happening here. We are finally going somewhere," Venegas said, 
noting that the idea for the exhibit actually originated with Loyola 
Marymount's Chicano student group. "This show will make a difference because 
with the Laband Gallery, this stuff is coming into the institutional level. And 
because it's being institutionalized, people are going to see it as 
legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia also said the tide is turning. "Our work is going to be making the 
statements. There's so much strength there that it can't be bottled any more. 
It's got to happen, because the work is meaningful and people will see that," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Echoed Guerrero-Cruz: "I think we're going to surprise people. We really have 
some strong work, and we just haven't been able to show it.
