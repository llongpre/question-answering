'Now this,' said Senor Gomez pointing, 'is called El Castillo in Spanish. It
means the castle. But it is not a castle. It is a highly accurate
multi-purpose calendar.'
WE TURNED in the direction he indicated, but saw neither a castle nor a
calendar. Instead, set in the middle of a vast grassy area where guided
tourist groups scurried to and fro, we saw a broad terraced pyramid rising
75ft into the air. Built of grey stone, it was the exact colour of the heavy
storm clouds that hung in the sky behind it.
On each of its four sides a steep flight of steps led up to a flat-topped
temple at its summit. Like ants on an antheap, the stairs and temple-top
were crawling with hundreds of figures dressed in bright red-and-yellow
nylon rain-jackets. Rain threatened.
Our own party was a large, mixed group - mostly German, Italian and Japanese
 -and few of us had an easy command of English. But this did not stop Senor
Gomez from delivering his guided commentary in a succession of rapid, jerky
bursts that left little time for reflection on what it all might mean. This,
after all, was a busy day at Chichen Itza, the most famous of the Yucatan's
Maya Indian ruins, and it looked as if the weather might break at any
minute.
'Now why do I say El Castillo is a multi-purpose calendar?'
A Japanese lady lifted a video camera to her eye and began filming him.
'Well, the Mayas were very interested in measuring time. There are 91 steps
on each of the four faces of the pyramid. That makes 364. Add one more for
the platform at the top and that makes 365, the exact number of days in one
year.' He beamed at us as if this explained it all. But there was more.
'Also, the staircases on each of the pyramid's nine levels show the 18
months of the Maya solar year, and the 52 panels on each side show the
52-year periods of the Maya calendar cycle.' Senor Gomez was getting into
his stride.
'How did the Mayas combine their ritual calendar of 260 days and their solar
calendar of 365 days so the same calculations were possible on both? Easy -
they found a common divisor. Both numbers are divisible by five. By
multiplying five times 52 cycles of 365 days by 73 cycles of 260 days, they
obtained 18,980 days, or 52 years, permitting perfect computations within
the Maya 52-year calendar cycle.'
We stared at him, speechless.
'Fantastico, no?'
Senor Gomez glared around him, as if waiting to be challenged on the clarity
of his explanation. Nobody challenged him. The Japanese lady stopped
filming. 'Say again,' she said.
'No time,' shouted Senor Gomez over his shoulder as he strode off across the
grass, perspiring in the warm and muggy air. 'Now follow me to the Ball
Court. It is a very interesting game. Under Maya rules, the captain of the
team that won was sacrificed to the gods. It was a great honour. Funny, no?
Come. I have many, many things to show you.'
I had had enough and wandered off to climb El Castillo. A puffing 91 steps
later, I was standing on the top and looking out over the endless, dull
green, table-flat jungle of the Yucatan peninsula.
How odd that in the midst of this great expanse of nothing a people more
than 1,000 years ago should have built great cities. How much odder that
they developed a high theocratic culture with advanced mathematics and
astronomy at its pinnacle.
It was scarcely surprising, I thought, that in a tour lasting barely two
hours Senor Gomez found himself hard put to explain the complexities of
Mayan civilisation. Its subtle yet exacting combination of science and
spirituality has baffled trained minds ever since ruined cities began
re-emerging from the Yucatan jungles a century ago. Together, Mayan culture
and Senor Gomez had certainly baffled my mind.
But the complexities of pre-history have not stopped Yucatan from becoming
one of the most popular regions for visitors to Mexico today. Almost
everyone who comes to the peninsula that divides the Caribbean from the Gulf
of Mexico is attracted by the lure of the ancient Mayas. They end up
enjoying it not just for the ruins of the Mayas of the past  - which tend to
be over-crowded, commercialised and difficult to understand - but for a
special atmosphere created by the Mayas of the present.
Rain began to splatter in heavy, warm drops. Straggling crowds streamed
through acres of monuments to seek shelter in refreshment stands and tour
coaches. On the way home to our hotels, a long, dreary drive through low
tropical bushland, the rain continued to fall in heavy sheets. By the time
we reached Merida some two hours later, water had flooded the narrow streets
of the town, stalled cars at intersections, and was lapping over the
sidewalks.
Unable to stir out, I spent the afternoon watching the rain fall onto the
lush vegetation of the inner courtyard garden of the Grande Hotel. A long,
cool drink at hand, I lay back in a rattan-woven planter's chair, the kind
in which colonials in every tropical outpost from Calcutta to Kumasi have
taken their ease. Surrounded by pillastered columns, etched-glass windows,
tropical hardwood furniture and slowly-whirling fans, I felt like a Merida
sisal king.
In the mid-1850s, some 300 years after the Spanish conquistadors had
virtually enslaved the Mayas, Spanish landowners discovered sisal. Used for
making rope and matting, the fibre found a ready market in Europe and the
US. By the late 19th century, the great plantation owners had made Merida a
gracious colonial city boasting more millionaires per capita than any other
in the world.
They sent their children to the best schools in Europe, imported treasures
from all over the world, and led the luxurious life of an aristocracy. To
the baroque cathedrals, governors' palaces and colonial plazas built by
earlier generations of Spaniards in Merida, they added scores of
French-inspired mansions and the Paseo Montejo - a miniature Champs Elysees.
The boom in sisal is long over but Merida's traditions and independent
spirit, like its architecture, food, music and language, remain. For
centuries Yucatecans have lived isolated lives on their southern peninsula.
Cut off from the rest of the country by vast swamps and jungles, they have
always been a group apart, and proud of it.
And what of those Yucatecans who are descended from the builders of the
pyramids? Present-day Mayas - many of them remain pure-blooded - may have
lost political independence and the ability to calculate precise dates 90m
years in advance, but they remain gentle, intelligent, good-humoured people.
To anyone coming from other large Mexican cities where traditional machismo
is so much part of the culture, Merida's 500,000 inhabitants seem an
unusually relaxed and friendly lot.
By the time darkness fell, the rain had stopped, the streets had dried, and
I was able to venture out for that favourite Merida past-time, the evening
paseo. Crowds of strollers had gathered on the Plaza Mayor, and Christmas,
only days away, had brought to the square a special atmosphere.
Trees, lamp-standards and statues were festooned with coloured lights and
paper. At wheeled streetside stalls, dark-haired women in embroidered
blouses were selling snacks of fried plantain, roasted corn and refreshing
glasses of sweet, almond-flavoured horchata. From long poles balanced on
their shoulders, ambulating hawkers sold children's toys: balloons, horns,
masks and flutes. Dressed in their holiday best, enormous families piled
into horse-drawn carriages for an idle tour of the town.
There was no lack of entertainment. Outside the door of the Grande Hotel, a
sidewalk marimba band was floating hot Latin rhythms out into the night. Up
the street in the cathedral, a choir was singing Mozart's Requiem. And on
the square itself, tiny children with dark, bright eyes were re-enacting the
Nativity. In 80'F heat, four-year-old Wise Men in silver paper crowns and
cotton-wool beards led a sad-looking Mexican donkey loaded with gifts to a
manger in a mock-up Bethlehem.
But I contented myself with just a turn or two around the square. I had work
to do. By my bedside table lay a complex tome by the learned Prof Demitrio
Morales. Its title: The Maya World. Tomorrow I would be visiting Uxmal,
another of the Yucatan's great archaeological sites. I was determined this
time, with the professor's help, not to be taken by surprise by a certain
Senor Gomez.
There are no direct flights between the UK and Mexico. Nicholas Woodsworth
flew to Yucatan with American Airlines (London tel: 081-572-5555), which
flies via Miami to the Yucatan resort city of Cancun. Car hire in Mexico is
expensive - about Dollars 80 a day - but many local companies organise tours
of Mayan archaeological sites.
The best time to visit Yucatan is between September and April, when rainfall
is at its lowest. Expect, nonetheless, a warm and humid tropical climate,
and take rainwear.
In London, information about travel in Mexico can be obtained from the
Mexican Tourist Office at 60 Trafalgar Square, WC2N 5DS. Tel: 071-734-1058.
