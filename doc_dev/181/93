This quaint and popular city is known equally for sun, surf and shopping. 
</P>
<P>
El Centro, however, has the most charming and reasonable shops. 
</P>
<P>
They are clustered along streets that run parallel to the beach, mostly north 
of the Rio Cuale that runs through Puerto Vallarta.

On the boardwalk, Paseo Diaz Ordaz, there are dozens of shops with trendy, 
casual and beach attire. 
</P>

Best are ACA JOE (No. 588) and Ruben Torres (No. 590), which have their own 
lines of attractive slacks (from $20 U.S.), shirts (from $15), shorts (from 
$15) and tank tops (from $8) in lightweight cottons and lively tropical colors.
