<LEADPARA>  IN A timely show called "Freedom Views: 1991," the Euphrat Gallery at De Anza
College examines a subject on everybody's mind in these postwar days.;    The
overall theme is taken largely from Deborah Kennedy's installation "For
Freedom," which uses the "four freedoms" defined in President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's 1941 message to Congress -- freedom of speech, freedom of worship,
freedom from want and freedom from fear -- as a reminder that people must take
a stand or risk losing their liberties.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Some of the works on view here are familiar, such as Enrique Chagoya's
giant editorial cartoon "1492," in which an Aztec god is greeted by
"civilizing" hands. It was seen recently at the de Saisset Museum at Santa
Clara University.;    Much in the show is interesting. Some of the art is of
good quality, but a lot of it is didactic and some ineffectual.;    One
instructive piece is Johnny Coleman's "Against the Wall/Scene of the Crime,"
which shows the outline of a slain black man drawn on a chalkboard. This
stark, eloquent image offers a comment about an educational system that denies
opportunity to African Americans.;    Glimpse of personal tragedy;  In a very
personal piece, Flo Wong stitches rice sacks into autobiographical collages
about her childhood. The sacks are emblems of the rice donated to the Wong
family after her father was shot in San Francisco, a period when she and her
mother were anxious about having enough rice to feed a large family, according
to gallery notes. It's a pity the pieces themselves don't convey more of
Wong's sincerity.;    By contrast, Louise Lieber's large mixed-media
architectural installation deals with a broad and abstract idea:
transcendence. The piece consists of three lattice-wood sculptures -- "The
Angel Who Weeps," "The Demon Swamp" and "The Wood of Saint Joan" -- all set
against a pink heavenscape. According to Euphrat director Jan Rindfleisch, the
work suggests a "mental landscape that reflects wars between good and evil."
But the installation stretches the point, taking up more room than it deserves
and diluting the impact of the show.;    Also included are spare and
attractive silk-screen prints by Frances Paragon-Arias, relating to the
American Indian sun dance ceremony. She uses linear elements to refer to
prayer sticks and presents everything abstractly, partly to protect the
private aspects of the ceremony and the freedom of worship.;    Why furniture
maker Emily Kiesel's "Diarama Desk" is included boggles the mind. It is built
of poplar and features four small, kitschy dioramas (get it?) about the life
of a hare. Clearly, it is not a statement about freedom.;    All the artists
hail from California -- except Juan Sanchez. This Brooklyn artist does
colorful print/collages combining photographic elements with diary-like
writings expressing the hopes, disappointments and fears his Puerto Rican
family experienced starting a new life in New York.;    The point of "Freedom
Views: 1991" is more moral than aesthetic, but the strongest work is as
visually compelling as it is thought-provoking.;    Take a stand;  Kennedy's
"For Freedom," an interactive installation, features four pairs of components,
each consisting of a platform on the floor and a framed screen on the wall.
The San Jose artist urges people to "take a stand" by stepping onto the
platform, whose surface incorporates various photographic views of the Statue
of Liberty's face. As on a bathroom scale, the weight of the museum goer
activates a lighted display of the text of one of the four freedoms on the
wall.;    Kennedy believes "people must act in order to bring freedom to life"
and must take responsibility for their actions. With its simplicity and
starkness, her installation conveys this idea and provokes us to reflect on
freedom on many levels.;    Despite the earnestness of these artists, one
comes away from the show with the feeling that paintings and sculpture are
more distanced from the theme of freedom than is film, print or TV. Can a work
of art actually be a politically effective force? I don't think so.;   
Nevertheless, "Freedom Views: 1991" offers a forum for discussion, and proves
once again that contemporary art doesn't exist in a vacuum.;    Freedom Views:
