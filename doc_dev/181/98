Politics are both monstrously medieval and hauntingly high-tech in Diego 
Marcial Rios' powerful show, "Arte Politico: Politics and Art/Art and 
Politics." 
</P>
<P>
Rios' large woodcuts, at Sushi Gallery (852 8th Ave., through Jan. 4), portray 
a society governed by violence and intimidation. Might makes right in this 
world -- intellect and sensitivity have long since been crushed, relegated to 
the weak and powerless. 
</P>
<P>
Rios, who lives in Northern California, charges his images with a sense of 
outrage, but never identifies either the perpetrators or victims of this 
overwhelming violence. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Order," he presents a full-length portrait of a timeless warrior, the 
specter of death itself. A skeleton with blood on its hands, the figure is 
nothing but bones, sheaths, laces and bolts. A puny, pathetic skull sits atop 
this hulking yet insubstantial body, and mounted on the head is a gun. The 
order of the day, suggests Rios, is to shoot first and ask questions later. 
Destruction precedes thought, and may even have replaced it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Rios' vision is a frightening one, extreme and allegorical yet rooted in a 
fundamental truth about American society's hair-trigger mentality, and its 
image as a big, boasting bully. Snakes, flames and jet bombers spew out of a 
human-like face in the image "It's the Peace Keeper," an allusion to the 
euphemistically named missile. And in other images, the Pope puts in an 
appearance as shadowy collaborator with the military. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Arena," Rios shows an immense eagle gnawing at the neck of a 
flower-wielding serpent. The symbolism seems simple, but the struggle is not 
merely between good and evil, for Rios makes the players more ambiguous than 
that. Both creatures seem threatening -- the bird with its hulking, oversized 
presence, the serpent with its razor fangs -- and neither promises peaceful 
conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Energy and eloquence merge dynamically in Rios' prints. Figures loom, dive and 
impose in a realm made bleak by soot and smoke. Death and evil pervade the 
work, and the biggest victim in this stark scenario is humanity itself. 
</P>
<P>
Local artists Ming Mur-Ray and Mary Louise Donovan have teamed up to produce 
their own show through Dec. 21 at a newly vacated La Jolla gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Situated in the Merrill Lynch building at Fay Avenue and Silverado Street, 
Gallery 130 was previously the Rebecca Cabo Gallery and before that Gwydion and 
Paris Green galleries. 
</P>
<P>
"Self," Mur-Ray's series of small oil paintings on steel, possesses a rich, 
disarming presence, despite the evasiveness of its imagery and the quietness of 
its presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Mur-Ray's series of small, rectangular paintings, with tapered bottom corners, 
divulges little but manages to convey a range of emotions. In each painting, 
highlights of a face -- cheeks, nose, chin -- or hand emerge as rust-colored 
patches in a dark, unyielding ground. The face appears pensive in one image, 
pained in another, searching, introspective, anxious and wild in the rest. A 
blindfold appears to mask the eyes in one, while a hand covers them in another. 
</P>
<P>
The immediacy of these images is literal, for the artist makes them by pressing 
her face directly onto the painted steel plates. She then works with the 
impression, painting out areas for greater drama or imprinting the wet paint 
with cloth to animate the texture. Framed in raw steel, the paintings appear 
strangely old, as though ghostly residues of ancient presences, vague imprints 
on burial shrouds, enigmatic and slightly haunting. 
</P>
<P>
The concentrated intensity of Mur-Ray's work could hardly differ more from the 
diffused blandness of Donovan's. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan's assemblages, collectively titled "Changed/Order," mix organic and 
artificial materials, often on clear plexiglass shelves joined by steel bolts. 
When parallels are drawn between the natural and artificial, the work can verge 
on poetry. Several small, wrapped bundles -- of twigs, bamboo and plexiglass 
rods -- have a raw, fetishistic power. A spiraling dried vine couples with 
copper wire in another poignant moment, but more often the bricks, bark, wood, 
metals, plastic foam and dried flowers in Donovan's work merely coexist in 
close proximity, without stimulating much dialogue.
