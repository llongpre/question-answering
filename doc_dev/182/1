<LEADPARA>  No one who has seen the film classic "Dr. Strangelove" will forget the
inspired lunacy when the arm of a character played by Peter Sellers takes on a
life of its own, flipping Nazi salutes and attempting to strangle the
wheelchair-bound defense adviser while Sellers struggles to control the
demented digits with his other hand.;    As far-fetched as that portrayal may
seem, there is apparently more than a grain of truth in it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     As many as several thousand Americans may suffer from a little-known
neurological disorder called "alien hand syndrome," in which their left hands
literally don't know what their right hands are doing, said neurologist
Rachelle Doody of Baylor University in Houston. Doody discussed the syndrome
Wednesday at a Boston meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.;    In the
least severe forms of the syndrome, one of the patient's hands may flop about
aimlessly.;    In more severe cases, it may try to do the same things the
opposite hand is doing or attempt to counter them. In the worst cases, the
hand may become aggressive, pinching, slapping or punching the patient -- and
in at least one recorded case even trying to strangle its owner.;    The
syndrome appears to be caused by damage to certain areas of the brain and is
often temporary, disappearing a few months after the damage occurs. It can be
reproduced in animals by damaging the same areas of the brain.;    There is no
treatment for the syndrome, but those animal studies suggest that it
eventually may be possible to develop surgical techniques to minimize the
symptoms, Doody said.;    The disorder can be frightening for patients, said
neurologist Ramone Leiguarda of the Institute for Neurological Research in
Buenos Aires, Argentina. Leiguarda recounted a written description of the
disorder by what he termed a "typical patient.";    "I was traveling on a
bus," the patient wrote, "when I noticed a hand approaching me from the right
from behind and trying to catch me. After grasping my trouser leg, the hand
would not release it. At first I thought somebody was robbing me, but then I
realized it was my own right hand. . . . I couldn't sleep at all that night
because I was terrified my abnormal hand would assault me while I was
sleeping.";    Usually the symptoms are not so dramatic, but they are
disconcerting nonetheless. In all cases, Doody said, the affected limb feels
foreign or alien to the patient, as though it is not part of the same body.;  
 Often, the affected hand will mirror what the normal hand is doing.;    "If
the right hand goes to do something, the left hand tries to beat it," Doody
said. This can make it difficult, for example, to dial a telephone.;    But
more often, the affected hand will try to do the opposite of what the normal
hand is doing, Leiguarda said.;    "If a person is trying to button a shirt
with one hand, the other hand will follow along and undo the buttons," he
said. "If one hand opens a book, the other will shut it. If one hand pulls up
trousers, the other will pull them down.";    Neurologists are not sure of the
precise mechanism by which the phenomenon operates, but it can be caused by
strokes, degenerative diseases or anything that causes damage to certain areas
of the brain, especially the thalamus, which coordinates sensory perceptions,
and the corpus callosum, which connects the two spheres of the brain.;   
Leiguarda said the syndrome is a frequent complication when surgery is
performed on the corpus callosum to alleviate severe epileptic symptoms.;   
Usually the phenomenon disappears in a few weeks to a few months after the
brain reorganizes itself to bypass the damage, Leiguarda said. "Usually, but
not always," he added.;    Doody has never seen "Dr. Strangelove," and
Leiguarda has not heard of it. But Leiguarda noted that he had been searching
through history and mythology without success to find a name for the disorder.
"Perhaps the 'Strangelove Syndrome' is not such a bad name," he mused.  </TEXT>
