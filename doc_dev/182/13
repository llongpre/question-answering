<LEADPARA>  THE U.S. Supreme Court is out of the closet. The myth that it is only liberals
who are judicial activists stands exposed.;    The Supreme Court has never
acted in as nakedly activist a manner as did the Rehnquist court last month in
a case known as "McCleskey II" (McCleskey vs. Zant). No longer will it be
possible for conservative politicians to proclaim that the appointees of
Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush believe in judicial restraint.  </LEADPARA>

Commentary  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In McCleskey II, the Supreme Court unabashedly legislated drastic
restrictions on one of our most fundamental rights -- the writ of habeas
corpus. The great writ, which dates back to the time of the Magna Carta,
entitles every person to challenge his or her unlawful confinement. It is the
basic check on a police state.;    Overturning long-established judicial
doctrine, the court held in McCleskey II that a person who is sentenced to die
following a prosecution tainted by serious governmental misconduct may not
file a petition for habeas corpus if he previously filed one and failed to
complain of the government's conduct -- even though he was unaware of the
critical facts because the government had deliberately concealed them from
him.;    In the name of efficiency and speed, the Supreme Court deliberately
chose to sacrifice fairness and due process.;    It is not surprising that the
court led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has, in a series of cases,
systematically gone about the process of dismantling habeas corpus. This court
has shown little concern with individual rights or personal freedom. Rather,
it has sought to increase the authority of government over the private lives
of individuals and to undermine historic protections against police abuse.;   
Only a week before McCleskey II, in the case of Arizona vs. Fulminante, one of
the court's most conservative justices, Byron R. White, made it clear that
even he could not stomach some of the more extreme activism of the
Rehnquist-led majority.;    Regarding the court's ruling that the use of a
coerced confession does not necessarily render a trial unfair, White
caustically observed, "Today, a majority of the court, without any
justification, overrules this vast body of precedent without a word and in so
doing dislodges one of the fundamental tenets of our criminal justice
system.";    On April 16, a day that judicial scholars and defenders of civil
liberties will long remember, the right wing of the court, with Justice White
back in the fold, did by judicial fiat what Chief Justice Rehnquist had been
unable to accomplish through other means.;    The events leading up to
McCleskey II are extraordinary. In his eagerness to limit the right of death
row inmates to challenge the constitutionality of their sentences, the chief
justice of the United States undertook several unusual steps.;    First, he
appointed a committee of five judges from the South, where almost all recent
executions have occurred, to conduct a congressionally mandated study of how
death-penalty appeals could be curtailed. The committee, headed by former
Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, brought forth precisely the type of report
that might have been anticipated. The chief justice immediately forwarded it
to Congress.;    The Powell report recommended prohibiting a second habeas
corpus challenge to a death sentence, even when the state had knowingly used
perjured testimony or had otherwise wrongfully concealed from the defendant
facts that would require reversal of the sentence.;    When the chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, Joseph Biden, D-Del., questioned Powell about
this patently unfair provision, Powell replied that his report couldn't
possibly mean what it said. Moments later, the chief staff member of the
Powell committee corrected his boss; he told Biden that Powell had made an
error, that the rights of unconstitutionally sentenced death row defendants
would indeed be cut off under the Powell proposal.;    The Rehnquist-endorsed
plan quickly suffered a series of resounding defeats.;    First, a majority of
the members of the Judicial Council of the United States, a body composed of
the nation's most senior judges, a group that ordinarily ratifies with
enthusiasm any suggestion by a chief justice, rejected the most controversial
parts of the Powell report.;    Then Congress, despite intense lobbying by the
U.S. attorney general and state prosecutors, refused to include any part of
the Powell committee's recommendations in the 1990 crime bill.;    A few
months later, the Supreme Court struck back. Having failed to obtain from
Congress the legislation the chief justice sought, the "conservative" majority
adopted the rule rejected by Congress, not only for death sentences, but also
for all convictions.;    The long-run consequences of this exercise in
judicial activism remain to be seen. At the least, one might hope that in the
future, frank discussion of the role of judicial philosophy and attitudes in
decision-making will be possible, and attacks on liberal judges by demagogic
office-seekers will be seen for the arrant hypocrisy they have always been.;  
 It is clear what we can expect from the Supreme Court for the foreseeable
future. In four or five years, the "conservative" majority has overturned
decades of civil-rights rulings, eliminated fundamental deterrents to unlawful
police practices, gutted the longstanding protection of religious practices by
persons other than those belonging to a "majority" religion, sanctioned the
invasion of the bedroom and the criminalization of homosexual conduct, and
proclaimed its eagerness to overturn the right to abortion as soon as one more
vote can be garnered.;    Certainly, today's majority is no believer in
judicial precedent. Nor does it follow the doctrines of "judicial restraint"
or "strict construction." A far different term from "conservative" is needed
to describe the activist right-wing majority that is rewriting constitutional
law in its own image.;    The judicial and political ideology that drives the
Supreme Court does not portend well for individual rights or fundamental
freedoms in these United States.  </TEXT>
