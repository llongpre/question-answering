<P>
Over objections from two justices, the state Supreme Court on Tuesday issued 
new procedural rules designed to speed the review of death-penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
The new standards require defense attorneys to ensure that habeas corpus 
petitions -- in which condemned prisoners raise new issues that go beyond 
claims in their direct appeals to the court -- are filed "without substantial 
delay." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, these secondary appeals, which raise such issues as inadequate trial 
counsel or newly discovered evidence, ordinarily have not been filed until 
after the defendant's direct appeal has been decided by the high court. Under 
the new rules, both such appeals ordinarily will have to be filed at virtually 
the same time, enabling the justices to consolidate their review of the 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The rules, announced in a statement by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, were 
issued in the wake of widespread concern among legal authorities over delay and 
uncertainty in the review of capital appeals. Lucas is co-chairman of an 
American Bar Assn. task force studying the problem in both state and federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
However, Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard, two liberals on a 
conservative-dominated high court, dissented from the rules "on various 
grounds," Tuesday's cryptically worded statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosk, it said, "particularly opposed" provisions that would impose new time 
standards requiring that, with some exceptions, habeas corpus petitions must be 
filed within 60 days after final briefs are due in the defendant's direct 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard "primarily objected" to applying the new standards to pending cases, 
Lucas' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also drew sharp criticism from Michael D. Laurence, 
director of the Death Penalty Project of American Civil Liberties Union of 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence warned that requiring defense attorneys to investigate cases and 
prepare briefs in direct appeals and habeas appeals at the same time could 
jeopardize the quality of a defendant's legal representation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a risk that innocent people may be rushed through the system because 
an appellate attorney was rushed through the system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael G. Millman, director of the California Appellate Project, a nonprofit 
group that assists lawyers in capital appeals, said the new standards will be 
"helpful in clarifying the expectations" of defense counsel. 
</P>
<P>
But Millman voiced concern about the fairness of applying to pending cases new 
rules that appear to represent "a significant break" from past procedures. 
</P>
<P>
On a different front, state Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane R. Gillette expressed doubt 
that the new rules would weaken the quality of habeas corpus petitions. And he 
welcomed the new policy as one that would improve the speed and efficiency of 
the whole capital appeal process. 
</P>
<P>
"We're enthusiastic about the new rules," Gillette said. "By combining the 
habeas proceedings with the direct appeal, we can get these cases through the 
state system much more expeditiously. . . . Overall, it will benefit the 
criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
The new rules say that habeas corpus petitions that are not filed within 60 
days of final briefs in direct appeals can be denied as "untimely." But the 
court will allow exceptions to the limit when defense counsel can show that 
petitions were filed within a "reasonable time" after they became aware of new 
facts or legal issues about a case. 
</P>
<P>
The rules also require court-appointed counsel to represent condemned prisoners 
all the way through direct and secondary appeals in state and federal court 
and, if necessary, to seek clemency from the governor for an inmate who faces 
imminent execution. 
</P>
<P>
The justices will consider replacing such attorneys "only if appropriate 
replacement counsel is ready and willing" to take over the job, Lucas said in 
the statement.
