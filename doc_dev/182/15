   The Justice Department opposes congressional
proposals aimed at eliminating lengthy delays of death penalty
appeals.
   A House plan would have the reverse effect of stringing out the
appeal process, and a Senate plan has technical defects, Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Paul L. Maloney told a House panel
Wednesday.
   The Senate plan, cosponsored by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., is designed to shorten death penalty delays
by replacing state habeas corpus proceedings with a single federal
court review.
   Habeas corpus proceedings are used by defendants who have been
sentenced to death and are trying to win new trials or sentences.
The Specter-Thurmond amendment was defeated, then passed 12 hours
later on May 24, allowing it to be added to a comprehensive Senate
anti-crime bill.
   The amendment would require federal habeas corpus petitions to be
filed within 60 days after final action by state courts.
   The amendment raises ``interesting possibilities'' for reducing
appeals delays ``through a stronger, more comprehensive system of
time limitation rules,'' Maloney told a House Judiciary subcommittee.
   But he added, ``We do find that there are some defects, some
technical problems if you will.'' Under questioning, he said the
amendment was still under review and that he was not prepared to
specify what the problems were.
   The two proposals are among several under consideration in
Congress to speed up death penalty appeals while ensuring
defendants' rights.
   The House plan, sponsored by Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis.,
would give death row inmates new appeal rights while ensuring that
their attorneys met strict experience and performance standards.
   The bill also aims to end appeals delays by restricting multiple
prisoner petitions, and establishing a one-year limit within for
inmates to file for federal habeas relief.
   But Maloney said the measure ``multiplies the opportunity for
delay and abuse'' in capital cases.
   He quoted retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, who said
recently that a vote for Kastenmeier's bill ``would in practical
effect be a vote to eliminate capital punishment in the United
States.''
   The department would recommend that President Bush veto the bill
if it passed Congress in its present form, Maloney said.
   But the bill was backed during Wednesday's hearing by civil
rights leader Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference. He said a broader supervisory role by the
federal judiciary was needed to stop the ``inexhaustible litany of
racial discrimination cases in the courts in the rural South.''
