<LEADPARA>  'THIS is more important than Clarence Thomas," Don Edwards keeps insisting.
And for death row prison inmates, the San Jose Democrat's latest cause is,
literally, a matter of life and death.;   Edwards is trying to block a Bush
administration bid to cut off most state prisoner appeals to federal courts.
The congressman and other members of an "Emergency Committee to Save Habeas
Corpus" say that 40 percent of such appeals are upheld, proving their merit.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ONE LAST CHANCE
PRISONERS' APPEALS TO FEDERAL COURT SHOULD BE
LIMITED, NOT ELIMINATED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Edwards is pushing a more moderate reform endorsed by the American Bar
Association and other legal organizations. Instead of virtually ending federal
habeas corpus proceedings, they would limit prisoners to one petition each and
impose a one-year deadline for filing.;   Latin for "you should have the
body," habeas corpus is a centuries-old defense against illegal imprisonment.
It applies to all inmates, but appeals from those sentenced to death are
especially numerous.;   We have no doubt that such appeals are flooding our
courts, state and federal, and that some prisoners have used them to delay
their executions for years. But for a society that aspires to justice, the
proper response is not to abolish the right of appeal, but to restrict its
abuse.;   Edwards finds himself in this fight for two reasons. He chairs the
civil and constitutional rights subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.
And as a long-time champion of civil liberties -- and dean of the California
delegation -- he's ideologically willing to take on an unpopular cause, and
politically powerful enough to get away with it.;   The Senate, swept along on
get-tough-on-crime sentiments, has passed the Bush version. Let's hope the
House will be wiser, and opt for the more moderate course urged by Edwards.  </TEXT>
