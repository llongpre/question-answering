   The Justice Department said Wednesday it
opposes a House plan backed by some federal judges to give death row
inmates more appeal rights than they now have.
   The department said also that it had ``technical problems'' with
a Senate-adopted amendment to shorten death penalty delays by
replacing state habeas corpus proceedings with a single federal
court review.
   Defendants sentenced to death sometimes use habeas corpus
hearings in attempts to win new trials or sentences. The Senate
amendment was defeated, then passed 12 hours later on May 24 as part
of a comprehensive anti-crime bill.
   The House and Senate proposals are among several under
consideration in Congress to speed up death penalty appeals while
ensuring defendants' rights.
   Deputy Assistant Attorney General Paul L. Maloney told a House
Judiciary subcommittee that the House plan would cause delays and
repetition in appeals, and that the Senate proposal contained
``defects.''
   The House plan is sponsored by Rep. Paul Kastenmeier, D-Wis.,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on courts. It
would give death row inmates new appeal rights while ensuring that
their attorneys met strict experience and performance standards.
   The bill also aims to end appeals delays by restricting multiple
prisoner petitions, and establishing a one-year limit for inmates to
file for federal habeas relief.
   But Maloney said the measure ``multiplies the opportunity for
delay and abuse'' in capital cases.
   He quoted retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, who said
recently that a vote for Kastenmeier's bill ``would in practical
effect be a vote to eliminate capital punishment in the United
States.''
   The bill was backed during Thursday's hearing by Joseph Lowery,
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He said a
broader supervisory role by the federal judiciary was needed to stop
the ``inexhaustible litany of racial discrimination cases in the
courts in the rural south.''
   The bill also has the support of several federal judges,
including Gilbert Merritt of Nashville, Tenn., chief judge of the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Maloney said also that the department was not ready to support
the amendment requiring the filing of habeas corpus petitions within
60 days after final action by state courts. The amendment was
authored by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   The Specter-Thurmond amendment raises ``interesting
possibilities'' for reducing appeals delays ``through a stronger,
more comprehensive system of time limitation rules,'' Maloney said.
   But he added, ``We do find that there are some defects, some
technical problems if you will.'' Under questioning, he said the
amendment was still under review and he was not prepared to specify
what the problems were.
