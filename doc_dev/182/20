Almost 40% of death penalty convictions have been reversed by U.S. appeals
courts in the past 15 years. The Bush administration has proposed legislation
to limit appeals of the death sentence.  </CAPTION>

jury that convicted him was loaded with friends of the sheriff.;    Death row
prisoner Jack Carlton House won a new trial in Georgia because his lawyers had
prepared no strategy, sought no witnesses, failed to discover useful evidence
in police files, and summed up the case to the jury with a short verse from
the Bible. "Both of us were too busy," one of the defense lawyers explained.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Death row prisoner Dennis Wayne Smith won a new trial in Florida because
his jury hadn't been told that the only witness to place Smith at the scene of
the crime had failed to mention Smith at all in his first statement to the
police.;    Constitutional blunders like these -- all of which survived state
court review and were remedied only in the federal courts -- are not
uncommon.;    But correcting them could get much more difficult if the Bush
administration succeeds with new legislation it is pushing, say many experts.;
   The administration bill would drastically curb a legal process known as
federal habeas corpus, designed to protect prisoners against injustices in
state courts.;    Over the past 15 years, federal judges have reversed
convictions, sentences or both in nearly 40 percent of all the death penalty
cases brought before them under this process.;    Critics of the
administration's action, while acknowledging that the complex appeals process
badly needs reform, accuse the administration of making the greatest assault
on habeas corpus since President Lincoln abolished it during the Civil War.;  
 "If the administration bill passes, federal habeas corpus will be legal
history," said American University law Professor Ira Robbins.;   
Administration's proposal; The administration's proposal, contained in its
broader crime bill, would shut federal courthouse doors to all death row
defendants whose claims were "fully and fairly" handled by the state courts.; 
  "That means," Robbins said, "that so long as the state appeals process was
adequate and fair, even if it led to incorrect results, that's good enough."; 
  Bush administration officials, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, his
conservative colleagues on the Supreme Court, most prosecutors, and often the
families of crime victims view habeas corpus as a constitutional guarantee
gone out of whack, an extraordinarily complex maze of repetitive, piecemeal,
chaotic and seemingly endless appeals.;    They see 2,457 convicted murderers
on death row filing 13,000 habeas petitions a year in a convoluted system in
which only 146 killers have been executed since the Supreme Court restored the
death penalty in 1973.;    For inmates executed in 1988, the average elapsed
time from sentence to execution was six years and eight months. For some death
row inmates, the appeals process has dragged out far longer.;    For example,
it has been 13 years since Robert Alton Harris killed two San Diego high
school boys, shooting one of the boys as he prayed for his life.;    Harris
has remained alive on death row while his resourceful lawyers carried various
issues through 75 state and federal court reviews, including four separate
appeals to the Supreme Court.;    Now, after coming within days of execution
at San Quentin, Harris is awaiting word from a federal appeals panel in San
Francisco on two new issues, including alleged perjury by a cellmate.;   
"What we are trying to do," White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said of the
administration's habeas corpus reform, "is to make sure that something that is
a principle of protection does not become a mechanism for unlimited
procrastination. . . . It's where the Supreme Court is headed.";    The
Supreme Court has placed new limits on federal habeas corpus three times in
the past three years.;    Errors still surface; Significant constitutional
errors continue to be uncovered in federal courts. In 1989, when the 9th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals overturned a Montana death sentence, Judge
Stephen Reinhardt observed:;    "The mockery of our criminal justice system
lies not in repetitive federal review but in the persistent disregard by our
(state) courts of fundamental constitutional rights.";    "Some inmates have
gone to their deaths despite the existence of clear constitutional errors,"
Robbins said. "We know that, because their co-defendants won reversals. There
are at least three cases like that.";    In one of them, Rebecca Machetti
masterminded the murder plot and her husband, Tony, fired the shots. Both were
convicted and sentenced to death.;    But on appeal in the federal courts,
Rebecca Machetti's lawyers successfully argued that the jury system in Bibb
County, Ga., systematically excluded women. She got a new trial and was
sentenced to life imprisonment.;    Tony Machetti's lawyers could have raised
the same jury issue but did not do so until it was too late, and he was
executed.  </TEXT>
