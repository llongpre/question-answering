   A young man pleaded guilty to robbing
an American tourist and in a fit of remorse asked that his 12-year
jail sentence be increased, the government's news agency reported
today.
   The agency said Judge Leonardo B. Canares of Cebu City, 350 miles
south of Manila, immediately obliged Wesley Corpus' request and
slapped one more year onto the jail term.
   The agency said the incident occurred Tuesday after Corpus
pleaded guilty to robbery charges and told the judge he felt the
original 12-year sentence was not enough.
   Corpus was accused of robbing an unidentified American of a gold
necklace worth $250.
