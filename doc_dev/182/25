   A judge ordered doctors to turn off
the life-support system for a comatose 13-year-old girl despite her
mother's wish that she be kept alive until her brother can return
from abroad to say goodbye.
   After an emotional hour-long hearing, state District Judge Jack
E. Hunter ruled Friday that Djahna Iolani Vogler's support system
could be turned off so doctors could recover organs for transplant
operations.
   The girl's father, Tx Paul Delmar Vogler of Houston, had sought
the order.
   Hunter's ruling was sent to the hospital by fax machine and the
system was disconnected. The teen-ager died a short time later and
some of her organs were recovered by an organ bank, officials said.
   The girl was being treated for an overdose of an anti-depressant
she ingested Monday at a home for psychologically disturbed youths.
   The girl had been comatose since being brought to the DeTar
Hospital in Victoria, 50 miles north of Corpus Christi, and doctors
Thursday declared her brain dead.
   ``There's no way to say how long those organs will be viable,''
Dr. Richard Sawyers testified over a telephone speaker in the
Corpus Christi courtroom. ``She could have a heart attack or kidney
failure.''
   Djahna's mother, Terry Sue Vogler of Corpus Christi, had asked
Hunter to keep Djahna on life support until Mrs. Vogler's son,
Steven, stationed with the Army in West Germany, could return.
   ``He said, `Mama, I'm coming home ... don't let them do anything
until I get there,''' Mrs. Vogler told the judge.
   Mrs. Vogler, who didn't oppose the organ donation, wept as
Hunter issued the ruling.
   ``The court must look at the overall picture,'' Hunter said.
``The only reason the child is alive now is because of the
respirator. The heart, liver and kidneys will give life to another
individual.
   ``Mrs. Vogler, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the entire family.''
   Steven Vogler, 22, apparently arrived home to Corpus Christi
Friday night, some hours after the hearing.
   Djahna had overdosed on desipramine, an anti-depressant. She had
been living at the Devereux Foundation, a private psychiatric
treatment facility where she was placed last summer on the
recommendation of a doctor who said she suffered from depression.
   Her parents were divorced almost nine years ago. The teen-ager
was in the legal custody of her father.
