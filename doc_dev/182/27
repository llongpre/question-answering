<HEAD>Court Will Study Appeal of Convicted Chicago Murderer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Supreme Court today agreed to study the
appeal of a convicted Chicago murderer sentenced to 50 to 100 years
in prison for his crime.
   The justices said they will use Warren Lee Harris' case to give
federal courts some further guidance in how to handle the appeals
of defendants convicted in state courts.
   Harris was convicted of the July 19, 1977, murder in Chicago of
Earnest Howard.
   After his conviction was upheld by the Illinois courts on direct
appeal, Harris filed a so-called habeas corpus appeal in state
courts. In it, he contended for the first time that he was denied
adequate legal help at his trial.
   State courts ruled that Harris could not raise that issue
because he had failed to raise it on direct appeal, but it then
rejected the merits of Harris' ineffective-assistance argument.
   Harris then sought help from the federal courts, in a habeas
corpus petition raising the same issue.
   A federal trial judge ruled that Harris' procedural default,
which usually would preclude federal court review of his claim, had
been waived by the state courts.
   But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last June 12 ruled
that the procedural default blocks federal court review of the
ineffective-assistance argument.
   The case is Harris vs. Reed, 87-5677.
