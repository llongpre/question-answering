FT  12 NOV 92 / Court asked to end Osman case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNSEL for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, has asked the High Court
to end the five-year legal battle of Mr Lorrain Osman to avoid extradition
to Hong Kong.
Mr Osman, 60, Britain's longest-serving unconvicted prisoner, faces theft
and fraud charges. He is making his ninth application for a writ of habeas
corpus, freeing him from custody at Brixton prison in south London.
Mr Stephen Richards, for the home secretary, said Mr Osman's attempt to
avoid his removal by repeatedly applying for writs of habeas corpus and
judicial review should now end.
He said the court should allow extradition to go ahead, even if Mr Osman
launched a 10th application for a writ. Judgment was reserved.
