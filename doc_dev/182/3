   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court made it tougher for
convicted criminals, especially those on death row, to file
repeated challenges to the constitutionality of their
convictions.
   By a 6-3 vote, the high court ruled that a Georgia inmate,
Warren McCleskey, convicted in 1978 of a murder the same
year, abused the legal process known as habeas corpus by
filing a second round of legal challenges to his conviction.

   A petition for habeas corpus is a civil action by a state
or federal prisoner normally filed after the prisoner has
been convicted and has had that conviction upheld on appeal.
The habeas corpus petition goes beyond asserting that
evidence didn't support a conviction and attacks the
constitutionality of any number of police, lawyer or judicial
practices that allegedly violated the defendant's rights.
   Conservatives on the court, in Congress and in the
executive branch have complained for years that prisoners and
their lawyers are dragging out death sentences by filing a
succession of habeas corpus petitions that rehash old issues
or raise new ones that could have been raised earlier. Both
the Bush administration and some lawmakers have proposed
legislation to limit the number of habeas petitions and the
length of time for filing them in death penalty cases.
   Yesterday, in a decision written by Justice Anthony
Kennedy, the court set a legal standard that will make it
significantly harder for prisoners to file more than one
petition for habeas corpus. The decision prompted a strong
dissent by Justice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Justices
Harry Blackmun and John Stevens.
   The high court ruled that when a prisoner files a second
habeas corpus petition in federal court, the prosecutor must
document which legal claims are being raised for the first
time. The prisoner must then provide good reasons why the
issues, such as interference by law enforcement officers or
unavailability of factual or legal information, weren't
raised in the first petition. The prisoners also must show
that the case was actually prejudiced by the alleged
constitutional violations.
   In McCleskey's case, rather than allowing a lower federal
court to apply this new standard, the court ruled that
McCleskey's second petition was an abuse of habeas corpus.

   Attorney's Fees
                                                                                                       

   By a 9-0 vote, the justices ruled that a lawyer who
represents himself in a civil rights case can't take
advantage of the federal law that allows successful parties
in civil rights lawsuits to collect their attorneys fees from
the losers. The decision, written by Justice Stevens, was a
defeat for a lawyer who successfully challenged a Kentucky
law that kept his name off the 1980 Democratic presidential
primary ballot. (Kay vs. Ehrler)
