   An American member of a mysterious Hindu
cult has been held in virtual solitary confinement since her
detainment last month by the Communist-governed West Bengal state,
her lawyer said Tuesday.
   Patricia Munday, 38, of Vermont, is not receiving the necessary
medical treatment, according to a petition filed in West Bengal
Court by her attorney, Bholanath Sen. Her hometown was not
immediately known.
   ``West Bengal government does not believe in individual
liberty,'' the lawyer said.
   Munday was detained by the West Bengal police Jan. 27,
apparently for her links with a cult called the Anand Marg, or the
Path of Bliss. The governing Communist coalition is opposed to the
cult.
   Munday is being held in a private hospital in Calcutta, the
capital. She is guarded by police and journalists are not allowed
to see her. The petition asks that she be moved to a hospital in
New Delhi.
   The habeas corpus petition was filed after the Indian Supreme
Court on Friday ordered the government not to deport her. She had
appealed to the Supreme Court to secure her release.
   Habeas corpus requires a person in custody be brought before a
court. It places the burden of proof on those detaining the person
to justify the action.
   ``Ms. Munday has been kept in virtual solitary confinement. ...
She needs better medical treatment, her injuries are yet to heal,''
Sen said.
   West Bengal's advocate general, Naranarayan Goopu, said there
was no need for the court to act on the petition because a similar
writ is pending before the Supreme Court and will be heard Friday.
   Gooptu denied Munday is being held in solitary confinement,
telling the court that police ``have only restricted her movement.''
   Munday, a member of the United Nations team that won the 1981
Nobel peace prize for its work with refugees in Somalia, arrived in
India from Katmandu, Nepal, on a private visit. A mob attacked her
and an associate on Jan. 26 when they were traveling on a
motorcycle near the Anand Marg headquarters in West Bengal's
Purulia district.
   Munday suffered head injuries. The Purulia police, instead of
lodging her complaint, detained her the next day. She later was
moved to the hospital in Calcutta.
   The Anand Marg says it aims to create a social, economic and
spiritual order that will replace both capitalism and communism. It
claims to have branches worldwide.
