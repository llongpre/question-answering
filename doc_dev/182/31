   This partially evacuated city,
spared the worst of Hurricane Gilbert, became a windsurfers'
paradise as crowds turned out to ride the blustery skirts of the
giant storm.
   Boarded-up buildings and empty streets made much of Corpus
Christi seem abandoned, but Ocean Drive was jammed with traffic jam
Friday as residents and tourists flocked to the seawall after word
that Gilbert would hit farther to the south than expected.
   Scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road, as
bicyclists, joggers and windsurfers were joined by crowds of
residents complaining of cabin fever in their boarded-up homes.
   ``This is definitely the advanced class,'' said Nancy Clark, a
legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35-mph winds here
after fleeing Port Isabel.
   Her biggest danger was the parking lot beside the beach.
   ``I was so excited when I got here and saw the waves that I
slipped down on the pavement,'' she said, rolling up her wetsuit to
display a small gash on her shin. ``This is what we wait all year
for.''
   ``This definitely rates a `10'. But it's also a good day for
conservative, positive sailing,'' said Corpus Christi architect
Robert Jones, one of about a half-dozen windsurfers who rode high
tides at 4 feet above normal levels.
   ``I was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up,
getting kind of bored,'' said Jones. ``I decided I'd just get out
here and see what the winds were like.''
   Many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay had heard
repeated warnings that Gilbert would likely turn toward the north,
striking land near Brownsville and bashing Corpus Christi with
heavy wind and rain.
   But when the hurricane stayed on its course toward Mexico, the
seawall swelled with confident crowds, despite warnings of flash
floods.
   ``Most people probably wouldn't expect to see this many people
down here in a hurricane, but once you've lived in Corpus Christi
for a while, you come to expect the unusual out of the residents,''
said Russ Roland, who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the
seawall.
   For a lot of the natives here it's seen as kind of a sign of
bravado, Roland said.
   ``We don't have this many people out here on an average day
during the summer,'' he said.
   Families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the
concrete steps, and children danced along the edge of the churning
water, mugging for cameras.
   Many, including Doug Reiter, said they just grew tired of
sitting inside a house darkened by plywood-covered windows.
   ``I think everybody is just bored, and this is kind of a release
from being cooped up,'' he said. ``You can only take that sort of
thing so long before you start getting stir crazy.''
