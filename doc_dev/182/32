   The House voted Thursday to do away with
``endless, endless, endless delays'' in carrying out death
sentences, handing the Bush administration a major victory in
debate on a wide-ranging anticrime bill.
   The 285-146 vote came as angry words and sarcastic cries of
`kill, kill, kill'' rang out in protest over repeated victories by
supporters of placing harsher death penalty provisions in the bill.
   ``Would it be possible to bring the guillotine directly to the
House floor?'' Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said with a mordant smile
after lawmakers added 12 more offenses to a growing list of federal
crimes punishable by death.
   The House also voted 257-172 to allow domestic manufacture of
semi-automatic assault rifles, whose importation has been banned by
President Bush, but only if American-made parts are used. The vote
threw out of the bill a section banning domestic manufacture of
semi-automatic weapons whose importation has been banned by the
president.
   Final passage had been expected Thursday evening, but the House
dropped the debate without a final vote in order to take up the
budget compromise.
   The measure calls for the death penalty for assassination of the
president and numerous other government officials. Treason and
espionage also would be punishable by death.
   Other features range from a shutoff in federal benefits for
convicted drug offenders to a one-year prison term for illegal
possession of steroids.
   In a victory for Bush, the House voted 285-146 to replace major
provisions requiring Death Row inmates to file their habeas corpus
petitions in federal court no later than a year after exhausting
direct appeals.
   Prisoners use these petitions to claim they were denied their
constitutional rights. Some Death Row inmates have filed repeated
petitions and thus delayed their executions for more than a decade.
   Democratic sponsors of the crime bill had incorporated in the
bill a plan that, besides setting a time limit for filing
petitions, would have guaranteed prisoners competent lawyers in
capital punishment cases. It also would have limited the defendants
to one habeas corpus petition in normal circumstances.
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., a leading critic, said exceptions to
the limit would result in ``endless, endless, endless delays.''
   The House adopted instead a Hyde provision leaving the matter up
to individual state legislatures to limit the time in which their
prisoners could file habeas appeals in federal court. Conservatives
who seek to shorten delays in carrying out executions hailed the
plan while liberals blasted it.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., complained that the plan, drafted by
a commission headed by former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell,
actually represented ``a plot ... by the chief justice'' of the
Supreme Court.
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist has been pressing for changes in
the habeas corpus law.
   As it came to the floor, the bill prescribed capital punishment
for 10 groups of offenses approved by the Judiciary Committee.
   The House approved 271-159 an amendment sponsored by Rep. George
Gekas, R-Pa., calling for the death penalty for offenses ranging
from genocide to murder by mail bombing. It included murder through
terrorist bombing of an airplane, train wreck and destruction of a
motor vehicle.
   Gekas told the House that the bill needed stiffening and that
his plan was supported by a wide range of Americans ``from the cop
on the beat to the man on the street.''
   Democratic sponsors of the measure said some of its provisions
appeared unconstitutional. ``I hope we never bring up another crime
bill a month before an election,'' Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J.,
said. ``Because today we are tearing up a document that has served
us well for many years.''
   Sarcastic cries of ``kill, kill, kill'' wafted briefly from a
knot f lawmakers near a door on the Democratic side of the chamber.
   The Senate already has approved a different bill that, unlike
the House version, would curb nine semiautomatic assault weapons.
Differences will have to be resolved by a House-Senate conference
committee.
   As it became clear that the Gekas plan would be approved
overwhelmingly, tempers started to fray. Rep. Craig Washington,
D-Texas, accused Gekas of not answering his question about how the
amendment would work.
   ``Thank you for not answering my question,'' he said.
   ``Thank you for not quoting a good question,'' Gekas said.
   Washington, who had already left the microphone and taken his
seat, shouted: ``You wouldn't know a good question if you heard
it.''
   The substititute provision on semi-automatic weapons was
sponsored by Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash.
   Handgun Control Inc., a Washington-based group that campaigns
for firearms restrictions, released a report to the Federal
Election Commission from Unsoeld's campaign committee, reflecting a
$4,950 contribution from the National Rifle Association shortly
after she introduced the amendment.
   The group issued a statement saying Unsoeld ``sold her political
soul to the assault weapon lobby in the hope it will help her get
reelected.''
   ``Absolute baloney,'' Unsoeld said. She said she had not
discussed the amendment with the NRA before introducing it and had
not known about the campaign contribution at the time.
   She said the amendment was needed ``because there are a lot of
us who support the Second Amendment (right to bear arms) who would
feel compelled to vote against the bill otherwise.''
