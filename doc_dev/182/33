   Southwest Airlines said it plans to expand the sale of airline tickets through automated teller machines in 7-Eleven stores to four Texas cities. 

   Tickets will be available from today until May 31 through about 500 automated teller machines in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Corpus Christi, according to TransFirst Corp., the operator of the MoneyMaker automated teller network. 

   The airline said it will reevaluate the program after May 31. 
If it proves successful in the new markets, Southwest probably will expand the program to additional cities. 

   Southwest said it decided to expand the program because of a successful test in Corpus Christi. 
As previously reported, Southwest began testing the concept last October. 

   Only one type of ticket -- a $15 standby fare for passengers between the ages of 18 and 21 -- will be available through the automated teller machines. 
The fare will be good for flights between Houston, Dallas and San Antonio and for flights between Houston and Corpus Christi.
