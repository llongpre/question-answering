  [Excerpts] We are going to start by repeating what we have 
time and again said here over the past few days: We are going 
through a tense social situation, which is marked by not 
entirely successful attempts to set up roadblocks. There is, 
above all, an atmosphere of uncertainty and insecurity. Workers 
have clashed with government forces on the streets using the 
technique of organizing in cell-style picketing groups. There 
are talks under way aimed at starting negotiations between the 
government and the Bolivian Labor Federation [COB], but no 
progress has yet been made in addressing substantive issues. 
While the situation is not new, it is worrisome just the same. 
  Violence took hold on the streets of La Paz this afternoon. 
Union leaders, policemen, and even common criminals participated 
in acts of violence. 
  The COB rally scheduled for this afternoon in San Francisco 
Square was not held. Police took positions over the entire city 
of La Paz, and prevented every form of street protest. As soon 
as a group of workers began to convene, police were already 
dispersing them. 
  Demonstrators moved toward the northern part of the city, 
where they continued to fight police personnel. Dozens of 
people were arrested. 
  The situation was altogether different at the Lima police 
precinct. There the ones who were surrounded were the 
policemen. The actions there were in no way related to the COB 
social struggle, let alone with the struggle waged by the unions 
of rural and urban teachers, who in recent times have often 
taken to the streets of La Paz. In this case, common criminals 
surrounded the Lima precinct to release their fellow criminals 
who were being held at the precinct. [passage omitted] 
  The criminals managed to open the cell, but there was only 
one prisoner there. Their next move was to try to hang the 
policemen, who locked themselves up in the precinct office. 
[passage omitted] 
  Finally, reinforcements managed to rescue the Lima precinct 
police personnel. 
  Disturbances in La Paz continued until very late. The 
demonstrators damaged several buses. You are now watching a 
clip of (Higuino Square), where the police dispersed one of the 
many groups of demonstrators and cleared the street for traffic. 
  No one was spared from the acts of violence on Peru Avenue, 
not even reporters. Three journalists and a press car were 
attacked this afternoon by rural teachers on Peru Avenue, where 
window panes were shattered and the windshields of cars and 
buses were broken. [passage omitted] 
  This time the demonstrators acted in small groups, giving no 
quarter to police. The clip you are watching took place near 
the court house, where the air was filled with tear gas. In the 
meantime, the last eight people still under arrest for breaking 
windshields and windows during the rural teachers demonstration 
on 22 April requested that the Fourth Criminal Court judge set 
them free during a habeas corpus hearing. Judge Lidia Molina 
upheld their request, and ordered that they all be released. 
[passage omitted] 
  The rural teachers have announced that they will file 
another 
habeas corpus petition to obtain the release of those arrested 
this afternoon.
