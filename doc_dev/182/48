CALIFORNIA carried out its first execution for 25 years yesterday, raising
fears among opponents of capital punishment of a wave of executions across
the US.
Robert Alton Harris was gassed to death in front of 49 witnesses at San
Quentin prison after a series of reversals in which a federal appeals court
four times stayed his execution, and was four times overruled by the Supreme
Court in Washington.
The Supreme Court overturned the fourth and final stay, which was issued
after Harris had been strapped in the gas chamber, and ordered the lower
courts not to file any more stays without the high court's permission.
After this ruling, Harris was hastily returned to the chamber for the last
time, looking sombre but winking at one guard. Harris was executed for
murdering two teenagers in 1978.
The state of California has often set political and social trends for the
US. It not only has the second-largest number of convicted prisoners facing
death - 328 after Harris's execution - but has also been the scene of a
vigorous public debate, as conservative politicians attacked the liberal
state judges appointed by Mr Jerry Brown, a contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination, when he was governor in the late 1970s.
Popular support for the death penalty as a punishment for murder has almost
doubled since the mid-1960s, when it fell to about 40 per cent. Nine
executions in 10 have taken place in the southern states. Black prisoners
have received a disproportionate number of death sentences.
Although the death penalty has been brandished by politicians as a weapon
against rising crime, it is rarely carried out.
Only 169 executions have been carried out since 1976. At the current rate,
15 times this number of new prisoners arrive on 'death row' each year.
The Bush administration last year tried to pass legislation making it easier
to carry out a death sentence by weakening the habeas corpus protections
which enable prisoners to delay execution with seemingly endless appeals.
The Democratic-controlled Congress responded by proposing to extend the
death penalty to 50 federal crimes - a largely irrelevant gesture which
covered such offences as the murder of a federal egg inspector. However, the
extension was also intended to curb indiscriminate sale of guns.
President George Bush then threatened to veto the entire bill, partly
because he claimed it would tie the hands of policemen and prosecutors by
further extending habeas corpus protection, but also partly because of his
opposition to gun controls.
The resulting stalemate has blocked any federal crime legislation, leaving
states to press ahead with their own solutions.
