<HEAD>Four Roman Catholic Bishops Meet With Married, Former Priests</HEAD>

   Four Roman Catholic bishops held a
cordial but noncommittal meeting with a delegation of former
priests who were stripped of their duties because they married and
who want to return to work.
   The hour-long exchange came Saturday during a retreat for about
200 members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   ``They listened and took notes,'' said Terry Dosh, one of five
former priests at the meeting. ``None of us got our hopes up that
anything could happen immediately. We're realists.''
   The four bishops, including Pierre Dumaine of the San Jose
Diocese, agreed to take the request to their national committees
for further discussion. At least one bishop appeared to support the
former priests' cause.
   ``Within the framework of the discipline of the church, which
has served the church well over the centuries, these men should be
encouraged to put their life experience at the church's service,''
Bishop Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh said in a prepared statement.
   The former priests are members of a Minneapolis-based group
called CORPUS, or the Corps of Reserve Priests United for Service,
which held an annual meeting over the weekend at San Jose State
University.
   The group claims about 10,000 members, about half of them
priests who married and are no longer allowed to serve.
   The meeting with the bishops was the first since the 1978
election of Pope John Paul II, who opposes letting married priests
or women celebrate Mass or perform other priestly duties.
   CORPUS President Anthony Padovano said the group tried before to
meet with bishops without success. CORPUS hopes the church will
reconsider the ban on married priests this fall at an international
meeting of bishops in Rome.
   Despite its insistence on a celibate clergy, the church in
recent years has allowed married Episcopal priests to convert to
Roman Catholicism, remain married and celebrate Mass, hear
confessions and perform other priestly duties.
   ``That's a double standard,'' said Guy Murning, who was ordained
as a Roman Catholic priest in 1970 but left eight years later to
get married.
