   Vacationers fled Gulf Coast beaches
Thursday, property owners boarded up homes and businesses, and
emergenc workers filled sandbags and readied shelters as powerful
Hurricane Gilbert took aim at the southern tip of Texas.
   Tens of thousands of schoolchildren from Brownsville to Corpus
Christi were given an unexpected holiday so families would have
time to evacuate, and northbound highways were jammed Thursday
afternoon.
   By 11 p.m., the center of Gilbert was about 275 miles southeast
of Brownsville and a torrential rain was falling. The storm, with
maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, was expected to continue with a
gradual turn toward the northwest expected later, the National
Weather Service reported.
   Brownsville police said they were requesting residents to
consider evacuating, but were not ordering them to leave.
   ``We've never evacuated the city and the point is, where are you
going to move 100,000 people?'' said Sgt. Dean Poos.
   In the coastal resort of South Padre Island, about 25 miles
northeast of Brownsville, the mayor ordered the 1,000 residents to
leave by 4 p.m.
   ``We can't force them to leave, but it doesn't make any sense to
stay,'' said Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr., adding that water and
electricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon.
   ``It sounds facetious, but people can stay as long as we can
fingerprint them so we can identify them later,'' he said.
   The town's government workers were packing up and moving to
higher ground, at a hotel in McAllen, about 75 miles to the west.
   ``Guests are checking out in an orderly manner, boats and
trailers are leaving the island,'' said Dick Bushnell, spokesman
for the South Padre Island Visitor and Convention Bureau.
   On Galveston Island, City Manager Doug Matthews recommended
Thursday evening that residents start evacuating.
   ``We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock we
are recommending evacuation of the island. We feel that we cannot
wait until the morning to make that decision,'' Matthews said,
adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45
to limit access to the island.
   Even in Houston, north of the most likely landfall and about 50
miles inland, the threat of Gilbert had an effect. Residents who
remembered the damage from 1983's Hurricane Alicia taped up
windows, stockpiled food and water and removed tall billboards
along freeways.
   While some Houstonians bought bottled water, tuna fish, canned
fruits and bread, residents of the exclusive River Oaks
neighborhood stocked up on canned crab and lobster and jars of
caviar to weather the storm in style.
   Promoters there even decided to postpone Saturday night's
sold-out show featuring Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy
Davis Jr. until Oct. 9.
   Military aircraft from bases along the Gulf of Mexico were flown
inland to wait out the storm at places like Midland International
Airport in West Texas, ideal because it's ``high and dry,'' said
airport spokeswoman Marcy Blauvelt.
   Brownsville was given a 27 percent probability of being the spot
where Gilbert will hit land Friday, though a hurricane watch was in
effect along the entire Texas coast as well as the northeastern
Mexican coast from Tampico.
   The National Weather Service estimated maximum sustained winds
at 120 mph and said some strengthening was likely with Gilbert
headed out over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The
hurricane, spawned last week in the Caribbean, caused at least 36
deaths in three island nations and Mexico's Yucatan and left nearly
one in four Jamaicans homeless.
   In Brownsville, at least 30 emergency shelters were being set
up, with the Civic Center boarded up and designated as the first to
be used.
   ``We are getting some sandbags ready with some volunteers in
case the agencies need them,'' said Timo Hinojosa, civil defense
volunteer coordinator for Cameron County.
   A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company was
doubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate those
fleeing the storm.
   In Corpus Christi, about 170 miles up the coast, residents
seemed more prepared for Gilbert than for previous storms,
officials said.
   Nueces County Commissioner J.P. Luby said workers removed heavy
objects from open areas, and many residents were stocking up on
emergency items.
   Many grocery stores in Corpus Christi, the largest city on the
Texas Gulf Coast, had run out of bottled drinking water and some
canned food. Plywood was sold out in some places.
   Southwestern Bell Co. asked cellular phone customers in South
Texas to try to keep the airwaves clear to allow emergency and
relief workers plenty of communication space.
   The company loaned 100 cellular phone units to Corpus Christi
officials and 100 more to cities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley,
said Pat McGeeney, a Southwestern Bell spokesman in San Antonio.
   Two people in Galveston were arrested on charges of
price-gouging, and Attorney General Jim Mattox said he has a task
force to prosecute people caught raising prices to take advantage
of Texans preparing for Gilbert.
   ``They are doubling and tripling prices for the products. It is
unconscionable for persons to take advantage of others who are in
desperate need,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, Gov. Bill Clements issued an emergency
proclamation allowing local authorities to temporarily suspend
``applicable rules, regulations and statutes to preserve the
health, safety and welfare of the public,'' including such things
as the direction of highways.
