   A 19-year-old woman who says she
was raped by up to 23 men on the hood of a car was encouraged by a
jury's conviction of the first of 10 men to be tried in the attack.
   ``It's not over yet, but it's going there,'' the mother of two
said Tuesday, hours after a jury found Orlando Garza guilty of
sexual assault and sentenced him to the maximum 20-year prison term.
   ``I'm relieved because now it will take off some of the stress
and pain that I had,'' the woman said Tuesday afternoon at the
offices of Crisis Services, a Corpus Christi agency that has
counseled the victim and her family since the rape.
   An agency counselor who attended the trial called the woman from
the Duval County Courthouse in San Diego, a south Texas town 60
miles east of Corpus Christi, near where the rape occurred. The
counselor said she awakened the victim shortly after the jury
returned the guilty verdict at 4:15 a.m. Tuesday.
   ``It (the verdict) was right,'' the victim said, ``because I
don't want him to go and do it to somebody else.''
   The woman, her 23-year-old husband, their 22-month-old son and
10-month-old daughter moved to an undisclosed location in Corpus
Christi after the couple reported harrassment following her
accusation that 10 men took part in her abduction and rape.
   ``She's happy,'' said Barbara Jackson, the counselor who called
the rape victim with the verdict. ``She said, `Thank the Lord.'''
   The victim said the guilty verdict takes away some of her fear
of traveling in public, and increases her determination to testify
against the other nine defendants.
   The woman told authorities that as many as 23 men sexually
assaulted her on the hood of a car the night of March 26-27 after
she was abducted and taken to a ranch where an illegal cockfight
was being held. She said she later was raped at two other locations.
   Garza, 24, who faces a later trial on an aggravated kidnapping
charge, claimed the woman insisted on having sex with him twice
outside the cockfight and that they had been having an affair for
some time.
   A 12-year-old boy testified Friday that he saw the woman being
sexually attacked at the cockfight. He named all 10 men charged in
the case.
