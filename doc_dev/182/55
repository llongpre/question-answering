<DESCRIPT>  TEXAS; ANIMAL; MISSING  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  A two-day expedition on a South Texas ranch has failed to produce any trace of
Bubba, the legendary wild pig that has inspired protests, folk songs,
souvenirs and headlines.;    Bubba, a chocolate- and beer-loving javelina,
belonged to Buddy and Patsy Thorne, who raised him from a piglet in their
modest bungalow on the outskirts of town. Bubba had his own specially heated
room out by the shed.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Last week, five years after Bubba's disappearance, the Thornes again spent
hours hiking and driving over rugged dirt trails on a cactus-choked ranch
about 100 miles west of Corpus Christi in search of him.;    The pig, who
would be 14 now, was seized by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department officers in
1986. They said the Thornes had no permit to keep a javelina, officially
classified as a game animal. They tranquilized Bubba, stuffed him in a trunk,
then let him loose in the wild.;    The Thornes' efforts to track down their
pet set off a hubbub in Corpus Christi. Protesters demonstrated at City Hall
over Bubba's callous treatment, and billboards demanded "Where is Bubba?";   
"He didn't know he was a javelina," said Patsy, who sought psychiatric care
for depression after Bubba disappeared. "He thought he was people.";    Bubba
preferred scrambled eggs for breakfast and patiently allowed the Thornes' two
daughters to brush his tusks after meals. He shared an occasional beer with
Patsy, usually after the lawn was mowed.;    The latest sightings of the pig
were reported last month. A group of hunters on a 5,000-acre ranch near Freer,
in the Rio Grande Valley, reported that they had petted a tame javelina.
Photographs of that animal and descriptions of its actions rekindled the
Thornes' hopes of finding Bubba.;    But their search was futile. They hiked
through the sagebrush and prickly pear, seeking clues. They found javelina
tracks and evidence of rooting in spots, but no Bubba.  </TEXT>
