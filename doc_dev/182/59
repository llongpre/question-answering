   Billie Sol Estes, a confidant of Lyndon
Johnson convicted in a multimillion-dollar fertilizer swindle in
the 1960s, has been indicted with five other people on charges of
stealing trade secrets.
   Estes, 64, was freed on $10,000 bail Tuesday with three other
defendants.
   The six were charged in an indictment unsealed Tuesday with
engaging in organized criminal activity. They were accused of
plotting to steal and duplicate trade secrets owned by Loadcraft, a
manufacturer of container cargo trailers.
   ``They were going to go into business against Loadcraft,'' said
District Attorney Ronald Sutton. ``They were basically ready to go
when we stopped it in March 1988.''
   It took more than a year to indict them because ``it takes a
mountain of records to put these things together,'' Sutton said. If
convicted, the six each face two to 20 years in prison and a fine
of up to $10,000, he said.
   Sutton said one of those indicted, David Jay Guzan, 41, of
Corpus Christi, had been plant manager at Loadcraft and stole trade
secrets and manufacturing plans before he left there.
   The group had set up manufacturing operations under the name
Loadstar International Inc. in Corpus Christi with financial
backing from the Corpus Christi Economic Development Board when
investigators stepped in.
   Estes, a contribitor to Johnson's political campaigns, was known
as an agricultural financial wizard in the 1950s and 1960s until
his empire collapsed after it was disclosed that its assets were
mostly paper.
   He was convicted in 1963 of mail fraud and conspiracy in a
swindle involving nonexistent fertilizer tanks backed by federal
agriculture loans. He began a 15-year prison term in 1965 and was
paroled in 1971.
   In 1979, his parole was revoked and he was sent back to prison
for mail fraud and conspiracy to conceal assets. He was released in
1983. His parole expired this year.
   After his 1983 release, he said, ``I'm just one drink away from
being a drunk and just one deal away from being back in prison.''
   In the November issue of Texas Monthly, Estes was quoted as
saying, ``I've always been able to make money. If I put my mind to
it, I could make a million in the next 30 days.''
   Also indicted were Guzan's wife, Molly Guzan, 41; John Andrew
Smith, 33, of Brady; Boyd Harrold Pool, 49, of Clarendon; Cheryl
Ann Vick, 27, of Yucaipa, Calif., and Loadstar, which is defunct.
   Sutton said Mrs. Guzan and Ms. Vick were to surrender today.
