<LEADPARA>  The Supreme Court, in a ruling that could hasten many executions, today cut
back on the rights of death row inmates to make repeated appeals of their
convictions.;    The 6-3 ruling in a case from Georgia was denounced by the
dissenters as a drastic curtailment of the rights of criminal defendants.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The court rejected arguments by death row inmate Warren McCleskey that
Georgia officials violated his rights when they failed to give him a written
statement from the inmate to whom McCleskey allegedly confessed the 1978
slaying of an Atlanta police officer.;    Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for
the court, said McCleskey's failure to raise the issue during an earlier
appeal in 1981 disqualified him from trying to use it in subsequent appeals.; 
  Kennedy said the burden is on defendants in such cases to prove they had
good reason for not raising the issue initially and that their failure to do
so has prejudiced their ability to defend themselves.;    For example, Kennedy
said, the prisoner must prove that state officials deliberately interfered
with his ability to raise the issue.;    It is not necessary for the state to
prove that the defendant deliberately abandoned the issue in an earlier appeal
to raise it subsequently, Kennedy added.;    The only exception to the new
restrictions are those rare instances in which the defendant can show he is
probably innocent of the crime, Kennedy said.;    He said the new rules
"should curtail the abusive petitions that in recent years have threatened to
undermine the integrity of the habeas corpus process.";    Under habeas
corpus, convicted defendants can appeal to the federal courts for help when
they claim their constitutional rights have been violated.;    A proposal in
Congress to limit habeas corpus petitions was introduced after a special study
committee appointed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist recommended time
limits on death row appeals.;    Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting
opinion, said today's ruling "encourages state officials to conceal evidence
that would likely prompt" prisoners to appeal their convictions.;    The court
"tosses aside established precedents without explanation . . . and applies
(new) rules in a way that rewards state misconduct and deceit," Marshall
said.;    McCleskey's murder conviction was overturned in 1989 by a federal
judge who ruled the state had violated his rights in obtaining his confession
to Offie Evans, a fellow prison inmate.;    But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reinstated the conviction, ruling McCleskey forfeited his right to
challenge the constitutionality of the confession by failing to raise the
issue in 1981.;    McCleskey's lawyers said they lacked evidence to challenge
the confession until 1987, when they obtained Evans' written statement after
the Georgia Supreme Court ordered police records made public.;    The defense
lawyers said Evans' statement gave them the first clue that the inmate had
been coached by Atlanta police to elicit a confession from McCleskey.;   
Georgia officials said the state had not deliberately concealed Evans'
statement from the defense. They said McCleskey's lawyers neglected to ask for
it.;    Today's ruling marks the second time the high court has reviewed
McCleskey's case. The court, in an important ruling in 1987, rejected
McCleskey's arguments that state death penalty laws are unconstitutional if
statistics show they are being applied in racially biased ways.;    Studies
have shown that killers of whites in Georgia draw the death penalty far more
often that do killers of blacks.;    The case acted on today is McCleskey vs.
Georgia, 89-7024.;     Other actions;    Other decisions today by the Supreme
Court:; (box)Cable TV -- The justices ruled that states may tax cable
television operators without having to levy the same tax on all other news
media. The 7-2 decision upheld an Arkansas sales tax on cable service.;
(box)Attorney fees -- The court ruled that lawyers who represent themselves in
successful civil rights lawsuits cannot collect attorney fees from the losing
side.  </TEXT>
