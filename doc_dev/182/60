<LEADPARA>  Twenty-eight years ago, in the Gideon case, the Supreme Court held that every
poor person charged with a serious crime was constitutionally entitled to a
lawyer provided by the state. The court later extended that rule to all
criminal trials.;   The Gideon decision is a solid precedent, hailed from all
corners of legal philosophy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There is just one trouble. In the real world, the promise of Gideon is not
being kept. Poor men and women in large numbers go to trial in this country
with lawyers who are so incompetent, drunk, inexperienced or uninterested that
the defendants' right to counsel is a bad joke.;   Judy Haney of Alabama,
whose husband had beaten her and their children for years, arranged to have
him killed. Murder by a battered woman is hardly ever punished by execution,
but she was sentenced to death. Why?;   It may have been because a
court-appointed lawyer was so drunk that one day during her trial the judge
found him in contempt and sent him to jail. The same lawyer failed to produce
hospital records that would have corroborated her story of abuse.;   That
story was told at the Atlanta meeting of the American Bar Association last
week by Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights. The
center does what it can to help poor defendants, and much of its work is
trying to repair the damage done by incompetent lawyers at trial.;   Did
counsel's failure matter? In that case, the judgment was reversed by a higher
court. The defendant got a new lawyer who presented the facts of her condition
to the trial court, and she was given a life sentence.;   A decent legal
system should at a minimum assure effective counsel for defendants whose lives
are in jeopardy. But the quality of lawyers in capital cases is shockingly
low. And the reasons are no secret.;   The pay for appointed lawyers in
capital cases is very low; some states limit the total fee for a case to
$1,000. Local judges who want to rush death cases through appoint the dregs of
the bar.;   The American Bar Association did a comprehensive study of state
death cases in which prisoners took constitutional claims to the federal
courts on writs of habeas corpus. The federal courts found in their favor in
an astonishing 40 percent of the cases.;   The ABA found that one factor was
largely responsible for the number of habeas corpus reversals. That was the
way capital trials were conducted by unprepared, underpaid and incompetent
defense lawyers.;   The study recommended that Congress set minimum standards
for defense counsel in capital cases. But Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
fought the idea, and it was killed in the Senate crime bill.  </TEXT>
