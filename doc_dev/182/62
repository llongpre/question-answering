<HL> Letters to the Editor: Western Culture Reflects Its Corpus </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to what JoAnne Goldberg asserts in her letter to the editor (June 6), the scope of Western culture is not expanded by selecting contributors to that culture on the basis of their sex and ethnicity. 
Rather, Western culture expands or contracts according to the quality of the contributions that constitute its corpus. 

   In the name of a spurious kind of equality -- leveling -- Ms. Goldberg could possibly be denying students equality of another kind, that of access to the very best in Western culture.
