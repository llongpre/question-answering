   The morning drive to work can be a
bore, but when a real boar got loose on a south Chicago highway,
things picked up.
   The large male hog apparently fell off a pig-hauling truck on
the Calumet Expressway on Friday morning, police said.
   ``At 6:09 a.m., somebody calls the state police and reports a
large pig in the roadway,'' said Capt. Anthony Lucito of the
Calumet City police. ``It's big. I'd say between 700 and 1,000
pounds. It's no small pig.''
   While traffic on the expressway was stalled, police spent about
30 minutes looking for the ponderous porker, he said, and it didn't
put up much of a fight.
   ``It was skinned up from falling off the truck,'' Lucito said.
   By Friday afternoon, the big hog was resting comfortably in a
cage at the dog pound, Lucito said. ``We're watering it down and
giving it a lot of food,'' he said.
   State police will return the pig if its owner claims it,
officials said.
   It's not all that unusual for pigs to fall off big trucks that
haul them around the country, state police Sgt. Sterling Bosco said.
   ``I had it happen to me about 10 years ago. I had a little pig
on I-55. Me and a couple of other guys tackled it and I put my
handcuffs on it,'' Bosco recalled, chuckling.
   ``The next guy I arrested I told him, `Hey, you know, I last
used these handcuffs on a pig.'''

   A Corpus Christi resort manager who
once warned tourists about straying into Wichita Falls apologized
for insulting the city and handed out T-shirts calling for ``Peace
in Our Time.''
   Stern Feinberg Jr. said Friday he never meant to offend this
city of 100,000 on the North Texas plains when he mailed out a
promotional letter asking Texas tourists to think of his hotel on
their next trip.
   ``Summer is coming and you will probably want to take an auto
trip through Texas,'' the letter began. He included a map, saying
``without a good map you might wander aimlessly around the state
and something awful (could) happen to you, like ending up in
Wichita Falls.''
   Jim Lonergan, publisher of the Wichita Falls Times Record News,
heard about the promotion and alerted the city's Board of Commerce
and Industry. Feinberg was invited to visit the city and Lonergan
guaranteed his personal safety.
   Feinberg and Corpus Christi Mayor Betty Turner took Lonergan up
on the offer and spent a day in Wichita Falls.
   Flanked by civic leaders, Feinberg and Mrs. Turner began their
tour at the city's 54-foot-high waterfall, where he was mockingly
arrested for breaking a city ordinance by taking off his shoes and
climbing high along the rocks around the waterfall.
   ``Aw, he'll fall. We'll get sued,'' one spectator groaned as he
watched Feinberg, whose hobby is rock climbing, scamper along the
boulders.
   Feinberg finished the day by passing out the T-shirts that said:
``Peace in our Time'' across the back, along with: ``I Survived the
Wichita Falls-Corpus Christi Summit, July 15, 1988.''
