<TEXT>
<P>
So that his faithful will not miss one goal of the Italians' anticipated rout 
of the United States in Thursday's World Cup game at the Olympic Stadium, Pope 
John Paul II has moved up the time of the Corpus Domani parade here by one 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Corpus Domani is an annual liturgical holiday to celebrate the Eucharist. 
</P>
<P>
A former goalkeeper in Poland, the Pope also cut short a visit to a school in 
Rome last Saturday so that the students could get home in time to watch Italy's 
opening game against Austria.
