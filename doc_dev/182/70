<LEADPARA>  AS HE LEAVES office, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh leaves behind a
question: Why has he used that great office to denigrate the rights of
Americans?;    It is an urgent question. This year is the 200th anniversary of
our Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. But it is a
hard time for constitutional rights.;    The American Bar Association, meeting
in Atlanta, has heard much concern about the state of the Bill of Rights.
Officers of that historically conservative organization have called for
national leadership to make us understand again the importance of the freedoms
that, as one put it, have "shaped the American character."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The U.S. attorney general is in a unique position to provide that
leadership. But instead, Dick Thornburgh treated constitutional rights with at
best disregard, at worst demagogic politics.;    For example, he carried on a
determined campaign to destroy an important aspect of habeas corpus -- the
right of federal courts, written into our law since the Civil War, to examine
claims by state prisoners that their constitutional rights were violated.;   
When he was charged last year with trying to wipe out that function of the
federal courts, Thornburgh said the charge was "outlandish." But it was true
then, and it is even more obviously true now -- last month the Senate approved
an administration bill that would have that effect.;    If there is any right
that an attorney general would surely be expected to support, it is the right
to counsel. But a provision in the bill says that court appointment of counsel
for poor prisoners and habeas corpus causes, which is now mandatory, shall be
discretionary. How small, how mean. Now Thornburgh is fighting a federal
judge's effort to prevent mob rule in Wichita, Kan., by the extremist
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.;    Anti-abortion demonstrators have
used force and threats to keep women from going to abortion clinics. Judge
Patrick Kelly relied on an 1871 law that forbids conspiracies against the
exercise of constitutional rights -- in this instance the right of women to
choose abortion -- as the basis for enjoining use of mob tactics.;    The
Supreme Court has agreed to consider next term the applicability of the 1871
law. The Justice Department will urge as a friend of the court that it does
not apply.;    Thornburgh said he intervened in the Wichita case just to make
that argument. "We're not taking sides in this case," he said in a press
conference.;    But there was no need to step into the tense Wichita situation
in order to anticipate a Supreme Court argument.;    The real reason for
Thornburgh's decision to intervene in Kansas is evidently politics. And that
is also the evident solution to the mystery of Dick Thornburgh as attorney
general.;    He has been widely regarded as a moderate man, sensitive to human
needs. But he is going to run for the Senate in Pennsylvania, and after that
he would like to be president. And he thinks the way to win is to appeal to
the right.;    Thornburgh was an assistant to Edward Levi, who as President
Ford's attorney general restored luster to that office after the Nixon years.
Thornburgh had a similar opportunity after Edwin Meese. He chose another
course.  </TEXT>
