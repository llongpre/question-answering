   A judge Thursday ordered a
newspaper reporter jailed because she refused to reveal all that
she and a murder defendant discussed during interviews.
   Prosecutors want to enter as trial evidence articles written
last month by Libby Averyt about Jermarr Arnold, 32. But the
reporter and her newspaper - the Corpus Christi Caller-Times -
maintain anything unpublished is nobody else's business. So State
District Judge Eric Brown held her in contempt.
   Arnold is accused in the 1983 slaying of jewelry store clerk
Christina Marie Sanchez in Corpus Christi.
   The 26-year-old reporter was expected to go to jail Friday.
Brown ordered her to remain behind bars until she agrees to answer
questions about the interviews with Arnold.
   It will be the second jailing of a Texas reporter this year.
   San Antonio television reporter Brian Karem was jailed for 13
days for refusing to reveal who arranged an interview between him
and a murder suspect.
   Twelve times during a hearing Thursday Ms. Averyt refused to
answer questions on First Amendment grounds. She specifically
refused to reveal any details that were not published.
   ``I don't want to go to jail,'' Ms. Averyt said after the
hearing. ``But my desire to avoid jail is outweighed by my duty to
stand up for what I believe in.''
   ``If reporters are allowed to be used as others' resources, a
consequence may be that reporters will offer the public less and
less information,'' said Larry Rose, the newspaper's executive
editor.
   The newspaper's lawyer, Jorge Rangel, said he planned to appeal
to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin to keep the
reporter free.
   ``Our position is that some of the questions call for disclosure
of unpublished information,'' Rangel said Wednesday. ``We are
asserting the reporter's qualified privilege under the First
Amendment.''
   The articles quote Arnold as saying that he shot jewelry store
clerk Christina Marie Sanchez.
   Defense attorneys don't want the articles admitted into
evidence. If they are allowed, the lawyers want Ms. Averyt to
testify about the content of her interviews.
   Rangel says a reporter's unpublished material is protected by
the First Amendment of the Constitution and similar provisions in
the Texas Constitution.
   Last week, Brown ordered Ms. Averyt to testify. The judge gave
Rangel until Wednesday to seek a ruling from the 13th Court of
Appeals on the case. When the Corpus Christi appeals court refused
to hear the case, Rangel took it to the Criminal Appeals Court.
   Rangel wanted the appeals courts to direct Brown to reverse his
order requiring Ms. Averyt to discuss the unpublished information.
   Under order from Brown last week, prosecution and defense
attorneys submitted a list of potential questions they may ask Ms.
Averyt.
   Defense attorneys Carl Lewis and Constance Luedicke said last
week they wanted to be able freely to cross-examine Ms. Averyt
about information Arnold may have divulged that was not included in
the articles.
   District Attorney Grant Jones said last week that the
prosecution wants to enter the published articles into evidence
because they contain information that Arnold did not reveal to law
enforcement officers.
