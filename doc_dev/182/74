   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it agreed to buy a Du Pont Co. chlorine and caustic soda production facility in Corpus Christi, Texas. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   Occidental, a large chlorine and caustic soda producer, said purchase of the Du Pont plant would raise Occidental's chlorine production capacity 17% to 8,585 tons a day from 7,325, and boost its caustic soda capacity 18% to 9,300 tons a day from 7,880. 

   Chlorine and caustic soda are used in the production of polyvinyl chloride resin pellets, a plastic raw material used in the building and construction, automotive, paper, aluminum and cleaning industries. 

   Occidental, a natural resources, chemicals and food-processing concern, said it expects to complete the acquisition in the third quarter, subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission, other government agencies and the boards of both companies. 

   Du Pont, a Wilmington, Del.-based chemicals concern, recently closed the Corpus Christi plant. 
It will employ about 200 workers, including some former Du Pont employees, and probably resume production during the second quarter of 1988, Occidental said.
