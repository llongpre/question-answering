   A mother and two young children
were presumed drowned Thursday in the Gulf of Mexico after their
small plane crashed in heavy seas that snatched an infant from his
father's arms as he swam to an oil rig.
   Two other men were killed near Forth Worth when their acrobatic
plane apparently stalled during a nose dive and crashed,
authorities said.
   The U.S. Coast Guard called off its search Thursday afternoon
for Sophia Mifsud, 26, her daughter, Ariel, 3, and 2-month-old son,
Martin, Lt. Mark Kasper said. ``We are presuming the three have
drowned,'' he said.
   The woman's husband, pilot Thomas Mifsud, 32, reported the
engine failed on his single-engine Cessna 210 Wednesday evening. He
ditched the plane into the Gulf about 100 feet upwind of an
unmanned oil rig platform, said Coast Guard Lt. Robin Starrett.
   Mifsud managed to get everyone out of the plane and began
swimming toward the rig with the baby while his wife grabbed the
3-year-old.
   ``He was hit by a real large swell and lost the baby,'' Starrett
said. ``He saw the wife and the daughter go by.''
   Mifsud made it to the oil rig and tried to throw a life
preserver to his wife and daughter, but apparently missed, Starrett
said. The life preserver was recovered Wednesday night.
   The plane went down about 30 miles south of Palacios, a coastal
community about halfway between Corpus Christi and Galveston.
Rescuers had expanded the search beyond the site where the plane
went down to account for drift caused by 32 mph winds and waves
measuring up to six feet, said Petty Officer Ron Atteberry.
   Mifsud is a U.S. citizen living in Guatemala, Atteberry said.
The plane was en route from Brownsville to Houston.
   Mifsud was treated and released from a Corpus Christi hospital.
   In the Fort Worth suburb of Azle, a 55-year-old pilot and his
42-year-old passenger died when a two-seater biplane crashed, Cpl.
Roland Real of the Texas Department of Public Safety said. Their
names were withheld pending notification of relatives.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the
accident, a spokesman said.
