<DESCRIPT>  TEXAS; CITY; OPPOSE; ABORTION; REGULATION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Voters in this heavily Roman Catholic city Saturday resoundingly rejected a
city charter amendment that would have declared "human life begins at
conception.";    The "Human Family Amendment" was strongly backed by abortion
opponents who placed the referendum on the ballot through a petition drive.
For more than a year, abortion battles have consumed this Gulf Coast city of
nearly 300,000. The city's name is Latin for "body of Christ."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The proposal had the active support of Catholic Bishop Rene Gracida, who
has excommunicated two abortion clinic employees and a doctor who performs
abortions.;    Of 30,007 voters who went to the polls, 18,487, or 62 percent,
were opposed to the measure and 10,775, or 38 percent, favored it.;    Sharp
reactions;  Among the proposal's opponents are Citizens United for Charter
Integrity, whose treasurer, Helen Wilk, described the proposed amendment as
"an effort to impose a personal religious belief on the citizens of Corpus
Christi.";    Tracy Cassidy, chairwoman of the Human Family Committee,
contended that the amendment was merely a statement of principle with no force
of law.;    "It's just giving recognition to the victims of the pro-abortion
morality in this city," she said Friday.;    Drawing on language from the
Declaration of Independence, the initiative spells out rights that apply to
"all members of the human family, regardless of age, development, physical or
mental condition, race or natural origin.";    It concludes that "human life
begins at conception and continues until natural death.";    Clergy backs
proposal;  Gracida was one of the first to sign the petition last summer, and
the bishop has urged parishioners to support it.;    Opponents said the
amendment could open the city to a spate of lawsuits to test its legal
weight.;    And saying human life "continues until natural death" could bring
lawsuits from people who fear their "living wills" asking not to be kept alive
by artificial means might be invalidated by the charter, said Amanda
Stukenberg, president of South Texans for Choice, an abortion rights group.;  
 But Hector Garcia, founder of the American GI Forum, a Hispanic civil rights
organization, sent out 10,000 letters urging support for the amendment because
he said he believes it would have forced the city to provide better health
care for the poor.  </TEXT>
