   Your April 22 column concerning the long-overdue decision
of the Supreme Court in McCleskey v. Zant (McCleskey's second
habeas case in that court), wrongly accuses the majority of
acting as legislators in that case. The radical expansion of
federal "habeas corpus" jurisdiction to review judgments of
state criminal courts was the product of a pair of cases
decided in 1963, by the revisionist Warren court: Fay v. Noia
and Townsend v. Sain. Subsequent legislation on the subject
merely codified what Congress apparently perceived as minimum
constitutional standards imposed by the Supreme Court.
   The McCleskey case does no more than address the
persistent abuse of the writ in intervening years by
activists seeking to overturn death sentences by any means.
Restoration of the tradition of respect for state court
judgments that was reflected in the Judiciary Act of 1789 can
hardly be considered judicial legislation. Contrary to your
ill-considered statements, federal habeas corpus jurisdiction
is not and never has been "virtually the only way a convicted
prisoner has to protect against law-enforcement abuses."
State courts can and do protect the rights of the parties
before them, and did so largely without federal oversight
until 1963.
