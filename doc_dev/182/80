   The Corpus Christi Caller-Times has
named new associate, managing and metro editors.
   The new associate editor, Nick Jimenez, has been city editor of
the daily newspaper for the past three years, it was announced
Sunday. David House was named managing editor and Tom Whitehurst
Jr. metro editor.
   Jimenez' responsibilities will include special projects,
strategic and long-range planning and being part of the newspaper's
editorial board, said Executive Editor Larry L. Rose.
   The 46-year-old San Antonio native, a Corpus Christi
newspaperman since 1968, was the Times' city editor from 1980 to
1986. The Times and the Caller merged in 1987.
   House, who earlier supervised the news desk, will direct daily
news-gathering operations as managing editor, said Rose. House
replaces former Managing Editor Norma Sosa.
   As metro editor, Whitehurst will oversee city and area coverage,
the newspaper said. He has been an assistant city editor since 1986.
   House, who joined the Caller-Times in 1987, was an editor on the
national and foreign desks of the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times and
Sunday editor of The Denver Post.
   Whitehurst, 32, joined the Caller-Times as a copy editor in 1983
and became an assistant city editor in 1986.
