   Things are not quite the same this year
for President-elect George Bush's Christmas quail hunting trip.
   When the Secret Service attempted to book hotel rooms for the
three-day trip, they found no room at the inns.
   For the past 20 years, Bush has hunted quail at Will Farrish's
10,000-acre Lazy F Ranch. Beeville, about 15 miles south, is the
largest town in the ranching area, 65 miles northwest of Corpus
Christi.
   Farrish is a close friend of Bush's and also manages the
president-elect's investments through a blind trust.
   Members of the national news media began planning for the trip
several weeks ago and booked most of the 88 hotel rooms in Beeville.
   Floyd Lee of the Secret Service office in Corpus Christi, said,
``We'll just have to go to other cities'' for rooms when Bush
arrives Dec. 26.
   ``I had Secret Service call me and ask for 60 rooms, and I just
had to say I was sorry,'' Evelyn Bloys, manager of Beeville's
largest hotel, the 59-room Best Western Drummers Inn, said last week.
   Bloys suggested the Secret Service could use a recently closed
motel, but it has been stripped of its light fixtures, carpeting and
furniture. Another suggestion was to rent dorm rooms at Bee County
College.
   ``We've never done it before,'' college spokesman Joe Cowan said.
``I'm sure if they asked, we'd work it out.''
