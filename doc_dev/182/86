<HEAD>Du Pont Will Introduce Substitute for Ozone-Destroying CFCs in
1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Du Pont Co. said today it will begin
commercial production in 1990 at Corpus Christi, Texas, of a
substitute refrigeration chemical for one of the major
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon compounds.
   The new compound is HCFC-134a, long has been considered by
industry as a potential substitute for CFC-12 used in auto air
conditioners, home and commercial refrigerators and freezers and
chillers for large building air conditioners.
   Though several other CFC substitutes have been announced by
chemical companies, this is the first for a market that Du Pont
says represents about 40 percent of the 330,000 tons of CFCs
consumed annually in the United States.
   Major nations agreed last year to cut production of important
ozone-destroying CFC compounds by 50 percent in 1998, and the
Environmental Protection Agency on Monday said it now believes
their use should be ended completely.
   Chlorine liberated from these compounds has been blamed by
scientists for depleting the ozone high in the atmosphere that
shields the Earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays.
   Since HCFC-134a contains no chlorine, it cannot destroy ozone in
the stratosphere when it breaks up, as CFC-12 does.
   DuPont, which has three small plants producing HCFC-134a for
research, said it would spend more than $25 million on the Corpus
Christi installation to make unspecified ``millions'' of pounds of
HCFC-134a annually.
