<LEADPARA>  THE SUPREME Court has created the strong impression, in recent decisions, that
it has an agenda for radical change: A majority seems intent on sharply
reducing the availability of constitutional protections for people charged
with crime.;    Two decisions in particular sent that message. On March 26, a
5-to-4 majority held that it can be "harmless error" to use as evidence a
confession extracted from a defendant by the third degree or some other form
of coercion. On April 16, by a vote of 6 to 3, the court put severe
limitations on the right of state prisoners to raise constitutional claims in
habeas corpus proceedings in the federal courts.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Anthony Lewis is a New York Times columnist.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In both cases the court went out of its way to reach sweeping results,
ignoring the usual restraints. It overruled precedents, some of them going
back many decades. In the habeas corpus case it reached out to decide an issue
before Congress. It seemed an impatient court.;    The character of those
decisions was brought home to me, by way of contrast, at a recent conference
in honor of the late Justice John Marshall Harlan. The conference was put on
by New York Law School, which he attended and which is celebrating its 100th
birthday.;    Harlan thought patience was an essential virtue in judges, along
with humility. He thought the Supreme Court owed respect to Congress and to
its own precedents.;    He was not against change. He believed that the
meaning of the Constitution's great open phrases must change with the times.
He wrote important opinions expanding the protection of free speech and
privacy. But he thought the court had to be cautious when it changed, and
candid. He was entirely against judicial agendas for wholesale change.;    In
the controversies swirling around nominations to the court in recent years,
all sides have held Harlan up as a model. Was that a merely cynical attempt by
political liberals and conservatives to hide behind a generally admired
figure?;    Professor Charles Fried of the Harvard Law School, who was a
Harlan law clerk, considered that question at the New York conference and
rejected the cynical explanation. He concluded that Harlan represented what
"many yearn for in their judges.";    And what is that? I think it is a
commitment to hard work, an aversion to shortcuts, a skepticism about utopias,
an open mind, a profound humanity. Those are the qualities that John Harlan
exemplified.;    "He had no vast projects for overruling great chunks of the
law," Fried said.;    Harlan was a conservative in the sense that Edmund Burke
defined: one who wants "to preserve and reform." Fried, who was solicitor
general in the Reagan administration, distinguished Harlan from "the radical
individuals in what journalists call the conservative revival of the Reagan
years.";    There is a striking contrast in judicial philosophy between Harlan
and the man who succeeded him on the Supreme Court, William Rehnquist. Chief
Justice Rehnquist is a conservative in a more ideological sense. He plainly
has agendas for overruling chunks of the law, and he is not detained by
Harlan's concerns for precedent and judicial modesty.;    Rehnquist wrote the
opinion last month announcing that the use of coerced confessions in a
criminal trial could be "harmless error." He simply ignored decades of
decisions holding that a conviction based even in part on a coerced confession
"cannot stand." Rehnquist's brusque, agenda-driven break with the past would
have been anathema to Harlan.;    When David Souter's nomination to the
Supreme Court was before the Senate last year, he told friends that among
judges of the recent past he especially admired Harlan.;    Souter provided
the fifth vote for the Rehnquist opinion in the coerced-confession case. Of
course no judge can merely mimic a predecessor. But we can hope that Souter,
and some of his colleagues, will reflect on what John Harlan would have
thought of such a judicial coup d'etat.  </TEXT>
