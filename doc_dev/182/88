   The airplanes will be supplemented by a system of tethered radar
balloons in the southeast, the Gulf of Mexico and all along the
southwestern border. Called aerostats, the balloons fly 10,000 feet
above the surface and provide coverage at lower altitudes, where
drug smugglers usually fly.
   Only four of 17 planned aerostats are now operational. Funds have
so far been approved for only eight more.
   ``Once we reach 1991, if we have the aerostats in place and
receive the kind of support we anticipate from the military, we will
have a very effective shield,'' said English. ``That's not to say
this will be the answer to the war on drugs. This does not mean
drugs won't come in, but it will be far more expensive, dangerous
and difficult.''
   Once the aerostat radar ``shield'' is operating from Florida to
California, the P3 flying detection platforms will come into their
own. These aircraft can see 360 degrees around and 200 miles away.
Radar specialists at two computer terminals inside can bring up
displays by simply touching their screens.
   As airplanes appear as small squares, the operator assesses their
speed, altitude, course and other data and assigns them colors:
green for friendly, yellow for unknown and red for hostile.
   The surveillance branch in Corpus Christi says 75 arrests
resulted from its detection program from July last year through
September of 1988.
   The single P3 AEW has operated only since July, and 15 of the
arrests have been made since then.
   In the 14-month period, 30 land vehicles or boats and 17
airplanes were seized, and five of the aircraft were taken since the
P3 detection platform has been flying.
   The entire air branch reported 438 arrests in fiscal 1988, up
from 250 in 1987 and 167 in 1986. Also in fiscal 1988, 71 airplanes,
176 vehicles and 22 boats were seized.
   The P3 detection platforms will eventually fly mostly ``defense
in depth'' missions, according to Customs officials.
   A concept already tested at least four times successfully,
Customs aircraft would fly long hours off the coast of producer
countries such as Colombia and observe virtually every air departure
from a known drug region. This would make it far easier to sort
suspicious from legitimate aircraft, one of the most difficult jobs
now facing the surveillance unit.
   In the first such endurance test off Colombia, the detection rate
was regarded as phenomenal, and the deterrent was so strong that
smugglers stopped flying once they realized something was amiss.
   ``The best hunting I've had,'' one radar operator said of the
three Customs Service and one Coast Guard aircraft that flew in
shifts for 16 hours a day.
   Adams, the surveillance unit air branch chief, said that without
such operations, the surveillance unit is reduced to playing ``a
chess game'' in the air.
   ``It's really hard to be in the right place at the right time,''
said radar operator Buck Benham, as he scanned the skies on his
radar scope in one of the four P3 trackers without the sophisticated
dome.
   Instead of chasing airborne suspects, Benham was trying to take
over the dome plane's detection job, which he likened to ``flying
around with a flashlight.''
   Customs can count on little help from countries south of the
border. Only two countries provide timely assistance, according to
aircrews: the Dominican Republic, which will launch a military
aircraft on request, and the Bahamas, which places officers on
U.S.-flown helicopters.
   Crewmen said it is difficult to gain cooperation from Mexico.
Calls for assistance in chasing boats and planes have to be routed
through the federal government in Washington, and the process can
take four hours. In that time, smugglers often dump their loads or
land south of the border.
