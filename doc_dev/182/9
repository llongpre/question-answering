<LEADPARA>  For years, the federal courts have stood between many death row inmates and
execution. Now what stands there is Don Edwards.;   At a time when the
popularity of capital punishment runs high, the San Jose congressman is
leading a quixotic effort to protect what he calls "a venerable right": the
broad right of these inmates to appeal their sentences. Today in Washington,
he is announcing the formation of a national committee that will seek to
persuade other members of Congress not to limit death row appeals.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It is not an effort likely to enhance Edwards' popularity. Nor is it
certain to produce victory when the House of Representatives votes on the
issue later this month.;   Growing numbers of self-styled crime fighters --
including President Bush -- now finger protracted appeals as the major
impediment to an effective death penalty. They point most often to
California's Robert Alton Harris, whose murder conviction has been snarled in
federal court for more than nine years.;   That Edwards has a chance against
these forces is a tribute to the respect he has garnered in his 29-year
career, and to the persuasiveness of his argument that society must be sure
before it condemns a person to death.;   But it is also testament to the
convoluted workings of Washington. Here, well-placed representatives can often
block the most popular initiatives through procedural sleight-of-hand. Edwards
and his allies did just that last year, killing appeals limits that had
previously won approval on the House floor.;   "Don Edwards, God bless him, is
very sincere about this issue, and I respect that," said California Attorney
General Dan Lungren, a leading critic of the death row appeals process. "But
there's something wrong with a situation that allows Congress to reject the
will of the public in its decision-making.";   Edwards responds that Congress
must also defend the rights of unpopular minorities. But he acknowledges that
his safe district in San Jose makes it easier for him to lead this particular
charge. "They just shrug," he said of his constituents. "They say, 'There goes
Edwards again.' ";   The right Edwards defends goes by a Latin name, habeas
corpus, and refers to proceedings in which a prisoner argues that he or she is
in custody in violation of the U.S. Constitution.;   Virtually all of the
nation's 2,300 death row inmates pursue such claims. A 2-year-old study of
Southern capital cases suggests these proceedings delay execution, on average,
by eight years. Inmates can file more than one as long as they are alleging
different constitutional violations: Harris has filed eight state habeas
corpus petitions and three federal petitions.;   Santa Clara County's most
well-known death row inmate, David Luther Ghent, is also pursuing habeas
corpus claims in federal court. He wants a new trial so a jury can consider
whether post-Vietnam stress syndrome drove him to murder his neighbor in
1978.;   Conservatives have tried for years to limit such appeals. In recent
years they've gotten closer, helped by a more conservative Supreme Court, and
by their own success in humanizing the issue.;   John Collins, Washington
representative for Citizens for Law and Order, breaks through the legal
technicalities by talking of his daughter, murdered in 1985. "When there's no
end to the appeals, there's never an end to a family's grief," he says.;  
Edwards came to lead the opposing side because of his chairmanship of the
House subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. He has assembled
high-profile help: the Emergency Committee to Save Habeas Corpus he is
announcing today is chaired by former U.S. Attorneys General Elliott
Richardson and Benjamin Civiletti.;   Statistics gathered by the group
indicate 40 percent of habeas corpus appeals are successful -- illustrating,
Edwards says, that habeas corpus works to ferret out constitutional blunders,
not simply to delay. Among the convictions overturned was that of a Missouri
man whose jury consisted mostly of friends of the county sheriff.;   Yet
Edwards and his supporters are running scared. The Senate has already approved
language in this year's crime bill that limits death row inmates to one
federal appeal, or no appeal if a judge finds an inmate got a "full and fair
hearing" in state court. The House Judiciary Committee opted for an
Edwards-drafted alternative, which preserves broader rights while placing a
one-year time limit on the filing of appeals.;   That sets the stage for a
pair of showdowns, first on the House floor and second in a House-Senate panel
that will negotiate a final crime bill. Though Edwards' liberal allies killed
habeas corpus limits in a similar panel last year, they may spark wider
outrage if they employ the tactic again.;   "It is a desperate situation,"
Edwards said. "But in all candor, I think I have enough experience to see its
importance and make this fight. You know, everyone else around here just talks
about Clarence Thomas. This is more important than Clarence Thomas."  </TEXT>
