   Continental Airlines today announced it will
build its $190 million dollar aircraft maintenance center and a
world headquarters complex in Houston.
   The maintenance facility, to be built at Houston
Intercontinental Airport over the next three years, is expected to
create up to 4,000 jobs, a $150 million annual payroll and a $600
million economic impact for the city.
   The headquarters building, to house 4,000 workers, will
consolidate Continental offices around the city and result in some
employee transfers from operations elsewhere. It would be near the
airport on city-owned land.
   Houston-based Continental said it needs the maintenance complex
because of planned acquisitions of new equipment. That facility
also will consolidate numerous Continental offices on a 150-acre,
campus-style complex.
   ``Our commitment to this project will help strengthen the
economic foundation of Houston and the state of Texas, while
continuing Continental's program of growth for the decades to
come,'' said Continental Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   Houston's Department of Aviation will finance the deal through
revenue bonds, which Continental will pay back. Continental will
lease the sites from the city.
   Houston won out over Shreveport, La.; Denver; and three other
Texas cities: El Paso, Corpus Christi and Beaumont.
   Continental has not yet picked a site for a separate engine
overhaul facility, to employ up to 1,200 workers. Cities competing
for that project include Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Denver, Houston
and Shreveport.
