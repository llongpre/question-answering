   A bus skidded out of control on a
rain-slickened highway and rolled over Saturday, killing four
passengers and injuring 20, four critically, authorities said.
   ``It rolled over about two times, tossing victims out through the
windows,'' said paramedic William Stover, the first to arrive after
the 3:45 a.m. crash.
   Only four people managed to stay inside the vehicle, and one of
those died of injuries sustained as the bus tumbled, he said.
   Four of the injured, including a 5-year-old girl, were in
critical condition and were transported to Corpus Christi hospitals
by helicopter and ambulances.
   The accident happened as the bus rounded a curve about six to
seven miles south of Falfurrias on U.S. Highway 281, Stover said.
   Officials were trying to determine what caused the Valley Transit
Company bus to crash, but were sure that the wet roadway was a
factor.
   ``We did have rainy weather,'' said Melinda Williams, a
dispatcher for the Brooks County sheriff's department in Falfurrias,
about 60 miles southwest of Corpus Christi. ``It was pretty bad out
there.''
   Survivors were lying on the ground all around the damaged bus,
Stover said.
   ``It was a mess,'' Stover said. He said he spoke to a man and
woman who sustained minor cuts. ``They both told me the bus slid
sideways into the ditch, rolled once, and then the bus continued on
over again,'' he said.
   Killed in the crash was Paul Salinas, 20, and Concepcion Rubio,
whose age wasn't known, Stover said. Families of the other two
victims _ a man and a woman _ had not been contacted by authorities
and their identities were withheld.
