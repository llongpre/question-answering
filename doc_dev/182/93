   Hundreds of partying young people
rioted on a Gulf Coast beach during the night before police moved
in with tear gas and helicopters early Sunday. And a car that sped
off a nearby ferry dock was pulled out of the gulf with two bodies
inside.
   ``What you have down there is a tremendous amount of
intoxication going on. All it takes sometimes is for someone to
bump into someone else. The crowd just turned into a riot,'' said
Jim Kaelin, an officer with the Texas Department of Public Safety.
   At least four people were stabbed and two law officers were
injured in the midnight beach melee, police said. Eight people were
arrested, and one person remained hospitalized Sunday.
   ``One thing led to another, and it became a riot out there,''
said Coast Guard spokesman Anthony E. Lloyd in Corpus Christi.
   Lloyd said most of the students appeared to be high-school age.
About 30,000 students were staying in this island resort for spring
break, he said.
   The violence began when a motorist hit a 16-year-old girl on the
beach at this Gulf Coast vacation spot on Mustang Island, offshore
from Corpus Christi, and tried to leave the scene, said DPS Officer
A.G. Michniak.
   Angry youths attacked the driver and torched the car, said
Police Chief Don Perkins. Officers pulled the man away from the
crowd before youths set the car on fire, he said.
   ``They stomped the car, broke all the glass out of it and
flipped it over,'' said Tom Frazier, 22, a student at the
University of Texas.
   It took more than 100 police officers to break up the mob with
the help of tear gas and hovering Coast Guard helicopters with
searchlights.
   The driver of the car, a 26-year-old San Antonio man, was in the
Nueces County Jail in connection with the accident, Perkins said.
Charges had not been filed by Sunday evening.
   The girl who was struck by the car was treated for abrasions and
bruises at AMI Coastal Bend Hospital and released, nursing
supervisor Sharon Parrack said Sunday.
   A portable toilet also was set ablaze, authorities said.
   The first police on the scene tried to arrest two people
involved in the alleged hit-and-run accident but found the crowd
too much to handle.
   ``Objects were tossed and thrown at the officers and they called
for asistance,'' said a DPS dispatcher in Corpus Christi who would
not give her name.
   Police fired seven tear gas projectiles to disperse the crowd,
Kaelin said.
   Michniak said the DPS received the first call at 11:35 p.m.
Saturday and the disturbance was not declared under control until
three hours later.
   Paul Cline of Port Aransas said he saw a stabbing victim while
leaving the beach.
   ``All of a sudden, somebody yelled and a guy fell. He had blood
all over his chest,'' Cline said. ``I heard them shout, `He's
stabbed! He's stabbed!' They started tearing at his clothes, and
then the police came running over.
   ``I left. I hate to say it, but I was afraid for my life.''
   The DPS estimated the crowd at about 3,000.
   ``A good example would be to think of a high school football
stadium where everybody ran down to the field and was packed
tight,'' Kaelin said.
   In an unrelated incident several hours later, a speeding car
crashed through a barrier at a ferry landing and sank in water 20
to 25 feet deep, Lloyd said.
   The small car sailed about 75 feet in the air before splashing
into the water and sinking, said Coast Guard spokesman Bob Fisher.
   A ferry captain and deck saw the incident, Lloyd said.
   ``The car just flew right off the ferry landing,'' Lloyd said.
``It didn't stop, didn't skid or anything, it just went right into
the water, and they saw its tail end going down.''
   The identities of the two young men found in the car were not
immediately available, he said.
   Most of those injured in the rioting were treated at nearby AMI
Coastal Bend Hospital and released, said a hospital spokeswoman. A
17-year-old boy remained at the hospital Sunday in stable condition
with a superficial abdominal wound, Ms. Parrack said.
