<HEAD>No Disciplinary Action Taken Against Priest Over Celibacy Comment</HEAD>

   The Archdiocese of Atlanta said Tuesday it will
not take disciplinary action against a priest at a suburban Roman
Catholic parish who said Pope John Paul II is ``dead wrong'' on the
issue of celibacy.
   The Rev. Anthony Curran ``was very gracious in acknowledging the
inaccuracy of some of his statements'' during a meeting with
Monsignor John F. McDonough at the archdiocese offices, said the
Rev. Peter Dora.
   Dora, communications director for the archdiocese, said Curran
could have been suspended from his priestly functions as punishment.
   Curran, a priest for 21 years, told his parishioners at Stone
Mountain's Corpus Christi Catholic Church last weekend that the
doctrine of priestly celibacy leads to alcoholism and other
aberrant behavior.
   Dora said the archdiocese had received ``numerous complaints
from parishioners'' about Curran's comments.
   Curran, 46, is associate pastor at Corpus Christi, which was
rocked last week by the indictment of a former priest for child
molestation and other offenses involving four altar boys.
   Dora said Curran will draft a letter to his parishioners
clarifying his statements, and after McDonough approves the letter
it will be read at Masses over the weekend.
   ``The diocese had problems with a priest using the pulpit to
address his own opinions and concerns. That was the central issue
as far as the diocese was concerned,'' Dora said. ``The question of
celibacy will continue to be discussed openly and seriously within
the Catholic Church within the appropriate settings.''
   Curran said Monday in a telephone interview that his parish's
crisis ``is of a much larger context'' than charges against one
priest.
   ``I think the real issue is, when will the church deal with the
truth of all the pain of celibacy as the clergy experience it?''
