<HEAD>Authorities Take DNA Sample from Aborted Fetus in Rape Case</HEAD>

   Police acquired the aborted fetus
of a 13-year-old girl so DNA tests could be performed to determine
whether her uncle got her pregnant during an alleged rape, a
prosecutors' spokesman said Tuesday.
   The effort to test the genetic tissue of an aborted fetus
apparently breaks new ground in the prosecution of rape cases, said
Tom Krampitz, executive director of the Texas District and County
Attorneys Association.
   ``As far as I know it's the first time that anybody has used
that to corroborate the testimony of the victim,'' he said.
   Ryland Hayden, 33, of Corpus Christi is charged with aggravated
sexual assault after his neice reported he raped her Aug. 9.
   The girl told authorities she was in a bed at her grandmother's
Corpus Christi house when she was awakened by someone smothering
her, a criminal complaint said. She said Hayden forced her to have
sexual intercourse after threatening to kill her if she cried out.
   The girl discovered she was pregnant after returning home to
Houston, and had an abortion, court affidavits said.
   A genetics laboratory has isolated the DNA from samples taken
from the fetus and the girl's blood. A sample of Hayden's blood
will be used for comparison with the fetus and the girl's blood.
   ``This test, once performed, can exclude up to 99 percent of the
male population as having been responsible for the pregnancy,''
Police Sgt. Phil Cunningham said in an affidavit.
   His affidavit was used in obtaining a search warrant needed to
take a blood sample from Hayden.
   Genetic fingerprinting usually is employed to allow scientists
to extract the unique biological code from tiny specks of evidence
such as semen, blood or hair roots.
   If the codes match, the scientists can testify about the
significance. If they fail to match, the information can exonerate
a suspect.
