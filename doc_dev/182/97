<HEAD>Texas Company Seeking Permission For Iraqi Oil</HEAD>

   Coastal Corp. has received
permission from the U.S. government to import as much as 2.6
million barrels of Iraqi crude oil.
   But the company must obtain permission from the Saudi Arabian
government to bring the light-grade oil to Corpus Christi, said
company spokesman Jim Bailey.
   The Saudi government opposes the release of the oil, worth about
$75 million, and is hesitant to make exceptions to the United
Nations embargo, which prohibits trade with Iraq and Kuwait, Bailey
said Monday.
   Coastal claims it should be allowed to purchase the oil because
it was exported from Iraq to Saudi Arabia through a pipeline in
July, before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The company must reach an agreement with the Saudis by the end
of the month because the Treasury Department permit requires the
oil to be delivered to the United States by Dec. 15 and oil
shipments from the Middle East take about 45 days to reach the Gulf
Coast.
   The company would pay for the oil through an escrow account that
would allow access by the U.S. government but not the Iraqis,
Bailey said.
   ``None of (the money) would go to the Iraqis,'' he said. ``It is
in the best interest of the United States because we could use the
crude.''
   The light crude would allow his company to make fuel for the
military, Bailey said.
   ``It is really in the best interest of Saudi Arabia as well,''
he added.
   The U.S. Customs Service seized a shipload of Iraqi crude at the
Port of Corpus Christi only two days after the Aug. 2 invasion. The
479,000 barrels were to be refined at Coastal's refinery here.
   Customs officials released the oil the next day after
determining it was bought before the embargo was implemented.
   Britain has granted Coastal a waiver to import the oil because
Coastal's trading subsidiary is headquartered in Bermuda, a British
colony, Bailey said.
