   Indictments against 10 men will not
repair the shattered life of a 19-year-old woman who remains in
hiding with her family since she reported being abducted and
gang-raped last month, friends say.
   ``They have to get out of San Diego,'' said Richard Yaeger, a
friend of the victim and her 23-year-old husband in this southern
Texas town of 5,000, where many residents are related. ``They'll
never be able to come back here.''
   A grand jury indicted 10 men Thursday on charges including
sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping.
   The couple and their two children, ages 16 months and four
months, have lived in a secret location in Corpus Christi since
shortly after she reported the March 26 incident, Yaeger said.
   Some of the defendants have said the victim was a willing
participant, and Yaeger said the victim and her family have
received threats for reporting the incident to authorities.
   The young mother returned to San Diego to testify before the
grand jury Thursday, and was led out of the courthouse with her
head and face covered by a black shawl.
   The woman said the four-hour series of assaults began at an
illegal cockfight at a ranch and continued at two other locations.
Bystanders ignored her pleas for help and some joined her
attackers, she said.
   Since news of the incident, however, well-wishers donated more
than $8,000 to the family, and the unemployed husband received a
job offer, said Dot Barnette of Crisis Services in Corpus Christi.
   ``I would say that the response from the community has been
fantastic, particularly with individuals,'' Ms. Barnette said.
   The 10 men who were indicted were arrested within days of the
attack, and will be re-arrested, said Rodolfo Gutierrez, a Duval
County assistant district attorney.
   Bonds for each sexual assault charge were set at $50,000; bonds
for each kidnapping charge were set at $100,000.
