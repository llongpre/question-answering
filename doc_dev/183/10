MARKETING: AS RETAILERS ADD UP THEIR HOLIDAY SALES, SEVERAL MUCH-BALLYHOOED 
PRODUCTS STAND OUT AS DUDS.

Neon bicycle pants and T-shirts flickered out. Books about the environment are 
heading to the dump. And the movie "Bonfire of the Vanities" is going up in 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
In a Christmas season of weak consumer spending and widespread economic pain, 
these seem to be among the biggest commercial flops. 
</P>
<P>
Marketers went into the holidays knowing that Americans were worried about the 
economy and reluctant to part with their dollars. So, many merchants took few 
chances -- by and large, they stocked their shelves with conservative fashions 
or products that appeared to be proven winners. 
</P>
<P>
Stores also tried to keep their inventories lean to avoid getting stuck with 
piles of surprise losers. "We didn't have any big dogs," said Gail Dorn, a 
spokeswoman for Target Stores. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were Christmas duds aplenty. Take, for example, the parade of 
dolls designed to compete with Mattel's ever-popular Barbie. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were Matchbox's Real Models, including likenesses of Christie 
Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs and Beverly Johnson. They found out that Barbie is one 
tough cookie. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who goes against Barbie gets their head handed to them," said Larry 
Carlat, editor of the trade publication Toy &amp; Hobby World. "Most little 
girls see these dolls as Barbie's friends, and girls would rather have Barbie 
than a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, action figures aimed mainly at boys -- among them, Beetlejuice and 
Police Academy characters -- were thrashed by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 
a repeat hit from last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Not that all of last year's hot toys thrived again this year. Sales of Micro 
Machines -- inch-long replicas of cars -- sped downhill. In fact, many 
consumers turned away from the favorites of past years in the toy business and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Carlat said the action figures based on the hit television show, "The 
Simpsons," weren't "an out-and-out bomb or a stiff, but they didn't do nearly 
as well as expected." He said the figures arrived in toy stores too late, in 
October, after "Simpson mania" subsided. 
</P>
<P>
This year's books about the environment arrived too late and too numerous. 
"None of them sold," said an executive for Crown Books, the biggest bookseller 
in Southern California. "By the Christmas of 1990, people had had enough." 
</P>
<P>
"They all are on recycled paper, but it's still going to mean throwing away a 
lot of paper," the executive added. "That's the ironic thing." 
</P>
<P>
One of Crown's biggest disappointments: "Just a Dream," a children's story 
about ecology, written by Chris Van Allsburg, author of the previous 
best-seller "Polar Express." 
</P>
<P>
Expensive gift and coffee table books also faltered, with the $30 price level 
being a breaking point. But there was at least one major exception to the rule: 
One of the season's biggest hits was "The Civil War: An Illustrated History," a 
companion to the public television miniseries. It sold at some chains for the 
full list price of $50. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cookbooks staged a comeback. Biographies and autobiographies also 
did relatively well, including books about movie actress Ava Gardner, football 
and baseball star Bo Jackson and television newsman Charles Kuralt. 
</P>
<P>
But former President Ronald Reagan's memoir, "An American Life," was a 
disappointment even though it made the best-seller lists. It trailed "Millie's 
Book," the dog's-eye view of the White House ghost-written by First Lady 
Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a joke in the industry," said Neal Webb, marketing director for 
Ingram Book Co., one of the nation's biggest book wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
In the fashion business, the neon fad faded, particularly on skin-tight bicycle 
pants. Why? 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the baby boomers are now past 40, and they can't afford 
liposuction," said Alan Millstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report. 
</P>
<P>
Loose sweat suits fared much better, and men's neckties with bold or playful 
prints were an undisputed hit. 
</P>
<P>
Other mass market fashion flops were corduroy, cowboy boots and, in particular, 
suede and leather coats. Millstein explained that because leather is so 
durable, many people who bought flight jackets and other leather apparel in 
past years don't need to replace it yet. 
</P>
<P>
In the sluggish consumer electronics business, electronic piano keyboards were 
probably the biggest disappointment, said Louis Block, vice president of 
merchandising for the Philadelphia-based Silo chain. After several years of 
selling briskly, keyboards are being hurt by competition from Nintendo and 
other video games, Bloch said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest hits of the season, though, also was a consumer electronics 
product: the $60 Video Plus, an easy-to-use remote-control device for 
programming VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
Along with buying gifts, people normally flock to the movies during the 
holidays. This year, though, such highly promoted films as "Bonfire of the 
Vanities" and "Havana" have gotten off to weak starts. "Rockie V" also has been 
less than a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Their box office receipts may have been hurt by the glut of holiday season 
releases, with nine major films coming out since Dec. 19. In some cases, pans 
by critics may have hurt too. 
</P>
<P>
Citing two of the biggest Christmas hits, "Kindergarten Cop" and "Home Alone," 
analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Amdec Securities suggested that "stories won 
out over stars." He said moviegoers also seem interested in cheerful stories, 
perhaps as an escape from all of the economic gloom. 
</P>
<P>
A notable exception was the explosive box office debut on Christmas Day of "The 
Godfather Part III," which Logsdon attributed partly to the loyal following 
developed by the first two Godfather movies. 
</P>
<P>
Novelty items, as usual, had mixed results. Neiman Marcus stores, the tony 
retailer long known for its fancy, unconventional gifts, fared well with its 
$95 Silly Putty in an engraved sterling silver egg. The chain also succeeded 
with the 18-karat Golden Slinky, which went for $55. 
</P>
<P>
But Neiman Marcus' 25-hour clock, costing $82, was a disaster. Its claim to 
fame is that it shaves 2.4 seconds off of every minute, but what purpose that 
serves is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess people don't want more hours in the day, they want fewer," said Neiman 
Marcus spokeswoman Pat Zajac. "It must have something to do with stress 
management."
