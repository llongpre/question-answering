   The magic tricks, dazzling and amazing, flow one
into the next. A mime troupe sparks children's laughter, while a
basketball game on unicycles draws chortles from adults.
   Walking through a green light that appears to have no ramp
beneath it, Siegfried and Roy opened the first of 32 performances at
Radio City Music Hall on Friday night, a show as lavish in
constuming and lighting as those the late Liberace used to do.
   Siegfried and Roy are swallowed by two robots helped by
putty-colored people with big insect heads. A woman arrives, lifts
her arms and disappears. Another woman is seen swimming in a tank. A
cloth is thrown over the tank and when it's removed, a white tiger
is in there and the audience hears a tape-recorded roar.
   That all takes place in the first few minutes of the show, and
Siegfried and Roy aren't taking time to milk the applause. Their
show is so fast-paced the viewer has time only to gasp before the
next dazzlement.
   Women assistants suffer everything but being sawed in half. One
lies in a long box which is pushed together like an accordion.
Another swings on a swing from her waist up. Her skirt, legs and
feet dance out on stage separately. Another gets into a Japanese
box, which then is folded into a tiny square box. Unfolded into a
large rectangle again, she emerges from it. Another is balanced on a
spike, which seems then to skewer her.
   The charming Mummenschanz mime troupe from Switzerland was a
special favorite with children. A big green ``clam'' licks its lips
around a stuffed rabbit before gobbling it up. Two men wearing putty
masks made countless shapes with them, one pulling a pieces of the
``face'' out like chewing gum and whacking it back onto himself.
   The unicycle basketball teams are the King Charles Troupe, formed
in the 1960s as a Bronx unicycle club. There are a couple of Las
Vegas-style numbers by dancers wearing not much.
   The animals are beautiful. A white car drives on stage _ as
Liberace used to do _ bringing a mother white tiger and three cubs.
   Roy rides an elephant, which disappears, then reappears. At the
end, a 650-pound white tiger climbs atop a globe. With Roy on his
back, they're pulled into the air.
   It's a Las Vegas show and it's nonstop entertainment. New Yorkers
aren't too sophisticated for this.
