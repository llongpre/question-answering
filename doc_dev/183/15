   Redecorating with wallcoverings has become a popular
do-it-yourself project and manufacturers are encouraging the trend
by offering more coordinated patterns and borders in wallpaper
books.
   At the retail level, many shops offer guidance on how to hang
the covering and what types of adhesives to use.
   Retailers suggest you order all the wallcoverings you need at
the same time so they are all from the same color run.
   Before starting the job, check the lot numbers before unwrapping
the rolls and inspect the full length of each roll before you cut
it. If there are damaged rolls, return them.
   Consider what is on the walls in adjacent rooms before deciding
on color and pattern. You can choose a covering in a similar color,
with the same pattern scale or with the same ``feeling'' in mind,
such as a small floral pattern that coordinates with a larger,
bolder floral in the same colors.
   In general, light colors, textures and small overall prints are
unobtrusive, while large, splashy prints, shiny and metallic papers
dramatize space. To minimize bad walls, choose a low-gloss,
textured covering or a large overall print as long as it isn't
shiny.
   Small and dark rooms will seem more spacious if you choose pale
colors and small patterns.
   Lower a ceiling by covering it in a bright color or strong
pattern. Limit the use of a bold print by papering a foyer or hall
or small bath, since large, busy expanses of any pattern can become
tiresome.
   When it's time to apply the wallcovering, cover the pasting
table with plain brown wrapping paper or inexpensive tablecloths or
dropcloths. Don't use newspapers because the ink may come through
to the new covering.
   If you're working on top of old wallpaper, it's best to strip it
from the wall. Strippable or vinyl wallpaper peel off easily when
you grasp a corner and pull. Wash the walls with warm water and
scrape off the remaining glue with a putty knife after you've done
the stripping. If the wallpaper to be covered is in good, tight
condition, you can paper over it.
   At worst, rent a wallpaper steamer or apply wallpaper remover.
They soften the paper so you can scrape it off with a wide putty
knife. After scraping, wash the walls and allow them to dry before
hanging the new wallcovering.
   For a better-looking job, work slowly and don't try to finish
the projct in one day. Wallcovering paste dries slowly enough so
that you can adjust a strip and eliminate seam mismatches and
bubbles, if necessary.
   Save extra wallpaper, which can be used to fix small tears and
loose edges without repapering. For loose seams, apply the paste to
both the wall and the wallpaper, press the paper in place, smooth
it with a seam roller and then wipe away the extra paste.
   To patch a small damaged area, paste a new piece of wallcovering
larger than the tear over the damaged areas, matching the patterns
exactly. Allow the patch to set, but not to dry entirely. Then, cut
through both areas, clean the empty area and repaste the top piece.
Wait 15 minutes and roll the edges smooth.
   Other ways to use wallpaper:
   _ If there is a pattern, cut out some of the motifs and apply
them to lampshades and accessories.
   _ Wallpaper a closet.
   _ Create custom waste receptacles, perhaps from large round ice
cream cartons or plastic or metal wastepaper cans.
   _ Use wallpaper inserts on kitchen cabinets, bathroom counter
tops.
   _ Use for picture frames.
   _ Wallpaper borders can update and enliven old furniture. Just
glue them on.
