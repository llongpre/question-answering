<LEADPARA>  Q Our patio roof is held up by 4-by-4 posts set in concrete. Years of rain and
washing the concrete have caused the posts to rot where they enter the
concrete. How do I replace them?; A Brace the patio cover so it is well
supported and safe while you're working. Saw the rotted posts off close to the
concrete and where they meet the overhead joists.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Chisel out the remainder of the wood from the hole and coat the inside of
the cleaned-out hole with a concrete bonding agent, available at suppliers of
concrete and masonry products.;   Buy adjustable post anchors that will keep
the new posts off the patio floor, allowing water to run off without coming in
contact with the bottoms of the posts.;   Secure the post mounting bases in
the holes with quick-setting concrete. Before securing the new posts, seal all
ends with a good quality exterior wood sealer.;   This project may require a
building permit. Check with your city or county to find out.; Q I took out a
wall between a small bedroom and my living room. Now I notice the ceiling is
cracked and appears to be drooping. Why?; A You may have removed a bearing
wall that supports the ceiling joists and roof. Consult with a structural
engineer or architect to advise you on corrective measures.; Q Can antenna
wire be run into the same box as an electrical outlet?; A No. Coaxial cable
can, however, share a box with telephone wires.; Q I have an old desk with
worn drawer guides and the drawers don't slide in and out properly. Can I use
wood putty to build the guides back up?; A The wood putty probably would not
be as permanent as using Delta Disc Rollers. These are installed in the
corners of drawer openings and compensate for the worn parts. If you can't
find them locally, they are available in bags of 20 for $6 from Woodworker's
Supply of New Mexico at (800) 645-9292.; Q I spilled automobile touch-up paint
on an exposed aggregate driveway. What will remove it?; A In the morning,
before the concrete has had a chance to heat up, brush Jasco Speedomatic Paint
Remover on the dried paint according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cover
the paint remover with a tent made from aluminum foil and place something
nearby to shade the area from direct sunlight. Remove the paint with water and
a stiff, natural-bristle brush. It may take a couple of applications, but you
should have good results.  </TEXT>
