<LEADPARA>  Better Mail Than Jail . . .;     I READ your article about suggestions to
improve the Giants. Well, here's my 2 cents' worth: Get a new manager and
pitching coach. Get rid of the old pitchers. Start up the "Humm Baby" campaign
again. The Giants seemed to do well with that slogan.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  T. Mallory, San Jose;    But the manager invented the slogan. How can you fire
one and keep the other? The problem is hitting, not pitching. Last Friday when
Mike LaCoss lost 3-0, why didn't anyone get upset that the Giants scored no
runs?;    THANKS FOR your refreshing column on Don Nelson. I had come to think
there was some hidden tenet making it sacrosanct for the Bay Area sports media
to do anything but praise "Nellie the Genius." He should examine how Detroit's
Chuck Daly transformed the Pistons into a two-time NBA champion by making
astute low-level draft picks (Dumars, Rodman, Salley), motivating "over the
hill" talent (Edwards, Aguirre, Laimbeer) and avoiding excuses.; Geoffrey
Baker, San Jose;    Hold on. Nelson doesn't make excuses. He just doesn't make
it past the second or third round.;    WHO CARES about Rickey Henderson? The
guy is a Class A jerk. I am so tired of reading about him and Jose Canseco
that I am ceasing to watch the news or read the Mercury News sports section. I
wonder how many other people in the Bay Area feel this way?; Barry Russell,
San Jose;    I don't know, but let's take a survey: All people who aren't
reading this sports section, please raise your hands.;    I DON'T think you
gave much thought to your column about the 49ers' draft picks. The 1991
football season has yet to begin, and already you have counted out the 49ers'
first pick, calling Ted Washington "iffy" and mediocre. If you don't have
anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. (Mark: Please disregard the
preceding words. I'm a loyal reader, but was forced to write a letter arguing
an issue for a class. Your column was all I could find.);    Brian Hunter, Los
Altos;    Let's see if I have this straight: You were forced to insult me,
after receiving academic credit for reading my column. No wonder our
educational system is in trouble.;    I THINK you've blown the Ronnie Lott
story. Ronnie has been an outstanding player, but he openly criticized 49ers
management. I recall his salary holdout a few years back, which the team's
management handled with class. Ronnie has a large ego that requires regular
feeding, and let's face it -- the bottom line is, he sold out to scummy Al
Davis for an extra $200,000.; Don Warfield, Los Gatos;    I don't think it was
$200,000. I think it was what the $200,000 represented.;    A GUY I work with
insists that in Nolan Ryan's attic there is a decaying painting of some old
guy in a baseball uniform.; Gary Moore, San Jose;    Maybe. And whoever the
old guy in the painting is, the Giants will sign him by July.;    I USUALLY
enjoy your work. However, I did not enjoy your column asking people to pick
Jose Canseco's next date. If it was that slow a news day, you should have
simply left the front page of the sports section blank.; Dorothy Bence, San
Jose;    Funny. That's what Madonna said, too.;    DO YOU always write fairy
tales?;    John Koehne, Milpitas;    But . . .;    Q: WHAT'S the difference
between a well-written column by Mark Purdy, and Bigfoot? A: There have been
reported sightings of Bigfoot.; Bob Holden, Concord;    But . . .;    I DON'T
care what my brother says. You're the greatest thing since Silly Putty.; Dave
Holden, San Jose;    Wait a minute. Is this one of those "evil twin" ploys?  </TEXT>
