   Termites taste like fish, palm grubs
resemble pork sausages, and ants can remind one of goose-liver
pate, says anthropologist Darna Dufour.
   Sound tasty? Well, Dufour says, ``in the jungle, insects are
good to eat.''
   That was the theme of her lecture on insect cuisine Wednesday at
the University of Colorado Museum. It was a prelude to the museum's
``Bug Day Afternoon'' Saturday, when children and adventurous
adults will scour fields for large grasshoppers _ not to eat but to
enter in the ``Big Hopper'' competition.
   Dufour dined on such delicacies as ants, termites, beetles and
caterpillars during a 16-month study of the eating habits of the
Tukanoan Indians of eastern Colombia.
   In her research along the Colombian-Brazilian border, Dufour
found that the Tukanoans consumed insects as a food supplement and
sometimes as a sole source of nourishment when fish weren't
available.
   Natives preferred to harvest some of the insects, particularly
termites and ants, in larvae stages ``when they're highest in fat
and protein content,'' she said. Sometimes, insects like ants are
used as a spread for bread and the ants resembled ``bacon bit sort
of things,'' she said.
   Although some caterpillars are saved, most of the insects
collected are eaten rapidly. ``It's a hand-to-mouth situation with
insects,'' she said.
   Dufour said that after overcoming some initial queasiness, she
learned to like some insects.
   While westerners are repulsed about consuming caterpillars, she
added, the Tukanoans don't particularly like some foods, either.
   Milk ``makes them want to vomit,'' she said. And eggs and
chicken are out, because chickens are seen as scavengers.

   Bob J. Crisman
went nose-to-nose with George Washington and didn't like what he
saw.
   Crismore ventured onto Mount Rushmore this week to inspect and
patch the four granite faces as part of the memorial's annual fall
maintenance program.
   In 40-degree temperatures and a gusty breeze Monday morning,
Crisman stood on the two-story nose of George Washington and dipped
his blade in a bucket of ``putty.''
   The nose had hundreds of cracks.
   He's glad when the job is done, when he no longer is hanging in
a sling seat 300 feet above ground.
   Crisman, 39, is only the fifth person to perform the maintenance
duties since carving of the memorial ceased in October 1941. He has
worked on the memorial for the past decade.
   He applies the putty _ a concoction of white lead, linseed oil
and granite dust _ each year to prevent moisture from damaging the
rock.
   For his hazardous duty, the National Park Service gives Crisman
a 25 percent ``environmental differential'' to go where few men
have gone before.
   ``When you've got time to think about it, it's neat to be here,
to be walking in the steps of the men who created this memorial,''
he said.
