<LEADPARA>  WHEN selecting replacement fixtures for a bathroom remodeling project, most
homeowners limit their selection to what will fit through the bathroom door.; 
 But a whole new range of possibilities opens up when you consider fixtures
designed for new homes. These tend to be built on a grander scale, are more
luxurious, and have more built-in amenities.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A shower unit, for example, may have features such as one-piece
construction and molded-in seat and shelves. The reason these units are
designed for new homes is that they can be installed before all the walls are
in place.;   Window eases installation; You can install these oversize
fixtures in your remodeling project by opening an access in an exterior wall.
This usually involves removing a window and the framing below. If there's no
window, you'll have to cut a hole in the wall, which requires temporary
support for the ceiling or roof above.;   To remove the window, first take off
the interior casing. From the outside, pry the window from the rough opening.
With the window free, lift it out bottom first and let it slide down into the
opening as you pull it out.;   If you remove the window from the top, it could
topple and fall on you.;   Back inside, remove the wall covering under the
window frame. Remove the sill and also the cripples, which are the small studs
that hold it up. Do not remove the bottom plate.;   Ladders protect
fiberglass; To install an oversize shower stall in an upstairs bathroom, carry
it up two ladders, rather than sliding it up a ladder, to protect the
fiberglass. Once the unit is through the opening, reinstall the sill,
cripples, sheathing and siding.;   Before installing the fixture, relocate the
waste pipe if necessary. To make the job easier, use flexible, coiled tubing
rather than straight pipe.;   If your fixture includes a tub unit, gently tap
shims underneath the tub to level the unit. Fasten the unit's top flange to
the wall studs with roofing nails. If the flange is not pre-bored for these
nails, bore clearance holes to avoid cracking the fiberglass. Protect the
bottom of the tub with old carpet or cardboard since you'll be standing in it
to work.;   Install the drain, sealing it with plumber's putty. The overflow
riser fits into the port opening with a gasket. Use plumber's putty there,
too. If you're working in a tight area, frame out your partition wall at the
end of the enclosure after the plumbing is complete.;   Line up your water
supply and install the diverter valve. The diverter comes assembled and the
manufacturer supplies working dimensions for the installation.;   Lay out
these dimensions on the enclosure and drill through the fiberglass into a
block of wood with a spade bit to avoid chipping. Connect the hot and cold
supply lines to the diverter and secure it to the fiberglass by adding the
faucet handles on the inside surface. You can install the diverter riser for
the shower head above the shower enclosure.;   The riser pipe is supported by
a block nailed to two studs in the end wall framing. Once the tub is set,
frame out a 2-by-4 wall behind the diverter and around the plumbing.  </TEXT>
