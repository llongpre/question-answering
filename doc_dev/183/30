<TEXT>   BEST BUY; Veggies by the pot; To get a jump on spring vegetables, check out
the fresh, new supply of seedlings available in six-packs and 2-inch pots.
Look for tomatoes, squash, peppers and eggplant in six-packs priced from $1;
and in 2-inch pots priced from 50 cents. If you can't plant right away, keep
the plants in a cool location and water every day. They dry quickly in the
tiny pots.;  SOIL; Too wet?; Don't dig in the soil when it is water logged.
How can you tell? Pick up a handful of soil and squeeze it in your fist. If it
sticks together like Silly Putty, it's too wet. But if the soil is loose when
you open your hand, it's OK to dig. Digging in wet, cold ground will compact
the soil and ruin the tilth.;  el,-5 YOUR CHECKLIST; (box) Sow wildflowers in
areas where other plants don't seem to thrive.; (box) Divide and replant
