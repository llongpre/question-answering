   Maurice Seiderman, the makeup artist
whose elaborate masks and skin putty were used to age Orson Welles
in the film ``Citizen Kane,'' has died. He was 81.
   Seiderman died July 18 in Port Angeles of a heart attack, said
Dan Verheul of Sequim Valley Chapel Funeral Directors.
   He emigrated from Russia in the 1920s, living first in Florida
and then studying art in New York. He joined RKO Studios in
Hollywood, Calif., as a junior member of the makeup department in
the early 1930s.
   Confronted with the problem of aging the characters in ``Citizen
Kane'' as much as 50 years, he made a series of plaster casts of
the actors and sculpted pieces of molded plastic foam in which
their features gradually sagged and their hair thinned.
   Seiderman also produced the disfigured faces in ``Enchanted
Cottage''; makeup and wigs in ``Gunga Din'' and ``The Hunchback of
Notre Dame''; and worked on such Welles classic films as ``The
Magnificent Ambersons'' and ``Macbeth.''
   He made Raymond Massey into ``Abe Lincoln in Illinois' and
Judith Anderson into ``Lady Scarface.''
   He also was an inventor who researched the use of contact lenses
and held several patents in that field. It was his skill there that
produced the aging eyes of the actors.
   Late in life, he became an artist, painting abstracts on slides
under a microscope he designed himself.
   He is survived by his wife, Celita, and a brother.
