experiences everything from King Kong to Wittgenstein at the film festival

EVERYTHING perked up with the arrival of King Kong. The natives were getting
restless, and so were the visitors, as the 43rd Berlin Film Festival
floundered through early days. Then came a 60th birthday screening of Kong,
preceded by the raising of a 20-foot effigy atop the festival theatre.
This woke us all up. Cheered by the sight of a chained ape gesticulating
from a cinema roof, we forgot the pain of that interminable Japanese film
about gay street life; of that hectoring Swedish short about feminist fairy
tales; of that fantasy-clotted Competition opener Arizona Dreams, made by
ex-Yugoslavian Emir Kusturica with a cast twinning Faye Dunaway with Jerry
Lewis. And we tried to forget the worst disappointment of all: the sight of
Jack Nicholson with putty-face make-up piloting through David Mamet's
putty-brained script for Hoffa.
This at least brought Danny DeVito to town as co-star and director. Small
and round, DeVito resembled one of those objects marked 'bomb' in
comic-strips. His tongue was the fuse, fizzing away at press conferences to
prove you cannot dampen a Hollywood trouper even when the world dislikes his
film.
If Hoffa was a dull fresco about the postwar American labour movement and
the disappearance of Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa in the 1970s - murdered,
surmises Mamet, by Washington in concert with the mafia - Spike Lee's
Malcolm X and Derek Jarman's Wittgenstein added to the Berlin bio-pic count
and the them-versus-us motif.
Lee's film attempts to combine crowd-pleasing storytelling with radical
politics and fails. (More when it opens in Britain.) Jarman, less
reverently, turns the life of the Viennese-born, Cambridge-naturalised
philosopher into a lantern slide lecture with intervals for wacky comedy.
These last feature, inter alios, Tilda Swinton whooping it up in feathers as
Lady Ottoline Morrell and John Quentin snapping out the Bloomsbury
one-liners as, yes, John Maynard Keynes.
Terry Eagleton's episodic script - should we call it Brechtian? - is clever
but low on dramatic voltage. It needs Jarman's fluidity of staging, turning
a black-backed soundstage into perpetuum mobile of foreground colour and
motion, to provide pace and warmth. This and Karl Johnson's performance as
Ludwig W: a sweet, despair-prone gibberer, in whom passion and pedantry live
like a permanently quarrelling married couple.
But a few bio-pics go a long way. The best two films at Berlin came hot from
the imagination's kiln, complete with colourfully glazed images. From China,
Xie Fei's The Lake Of Scented Souls is a domestic melodrama heated to
tragedy. A village businesswoman, whose sesame-oil factory is eyed by the
Japanese, finds career pressures compounded by emotional ones. Her retarded
son abuses his newly 'arranged' bride; and the mother's own marriage, which
she was sold into at 13, is now crashing on the rocks of a drunken husband
and a lover who is an increasingly ill-kept secret.
Soap opera it could have been. Real opera it almost becomes. The director
blends Visconti-ish verismo in the images - sunsets glow with pain, lakes
sparkle with a sickly, piercing silver - with an overpowering central
performance. Siquin Gaowa as the Madame Bovary of the marshlands, running
through all known emotions and the hell with Oriental inscrutability, should
get a Best Actress nod or there is no justice in juries.
If the Chinese film is verismo, Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi from Mexico
is opera buffa. This gloriously eccentric action thriller cost Dollars 7,000
to make - one day's cigar money on most Hollywood films - and then burned
giant holes in the Latin American box office. It was promptly optioned by
Tinseltown for an upcoming Dollars 7m English-language remake.
The remake could not possibly equal the original, which resembles a Sergio
Leone Western made with mind-influencing narcotics. A zooming, carooming,
running, jumping, never-standing-still camera follows the hero and villain
around streets and deserts, unwittingly twinned by fate since they carry
identical black guitar-cases. (One contains a music instrument, the other an
arsenal of guns). A screen aflame with shoot-outs, punch-ups and comical
misunderstandings is set further ablaze by the filmmaker's wild ingenuities
of style.
Only one other Berlin film seriously warmed the imagination. Atom Egoyan's
Calendar will win no prizes (not in competition) and may win no British
release (65 minutes of unclassifiable semi-fiction). Yet the Canadian-based
director of The Adjuster here re-visits his ancestral roots in Armenia -
commissioned to take photos for a tourist calendar - and extemporises a
truth-based tale of marital break-up.
Main characters: himself (often a poignantly interrogative voice off
camera), his Armenian-born wife and the local guide who becomes her lover.
While a foreign sun shines on their bilingual imbroglios, flash-forwards
depict Egoyan back in Canada caught in the misery of serial dating. He tries
to snare new girlfriends while the now published calendar glows from his
wall, keeping alive old wounds. This beautifully cunning film about time,
space and emotional paradox is as intricate and many-angled as its own
heraldic leitmotif: the Byzantine churches that gaze timelessly, pitilessly,
majestically from the skylines.
Two other movies deserve nods in the fair-to-enjoyable category. Love Field,
directed by Jonathan Kaplan (The Accused), pushes Oscar-nominated Michelle
Pfeiffer into a black-and-white love story in glorious Technicolor. He's
black (Dennis Haysbert), she's white and they meet in the emotionally
colourful aftermath of JFK's assassination.
Idrissa Ouedraogo's Samba Traore, from Burkino Faso, is a sweetly acidic
village comedy from the maker of Yaaba and Tilai. Berliners complained that
the movie showed signs of Westernisation - good heavens, a robbery in scene
one and more action to come. But storytelling is no crime, and the same
critics were last heard complaining that Ouedraogo's previous films had no
plot. This one is wry, satiric and subtly humanist; and filmed in a burning
Bush that seems at once a godless wilderness and a crucible for godly
miracles.
Elsewhere Berlin has been an assault course of the unbelievable and/or
unendurable. While the Golden Bear scans the horizon for likely winners, a
series of Plastic Bears should be minted for such un-recyclable rubbish as
Japan's Heya, with its minimalist tale of a hitman who never hits; or
Germany's Lilies Of The Bank, proving like Schtonk] that there is no such
thing as German comedy; or Israel's Life According To Agfa. This last is a
sort of Iceman Cometh for the age of Palestinian-Israeli tension, its
one-bar setting squeezed for maximum melodrama by director Assi Dayan, son
of Moshe.
Why does Berlin import these turkeys? Perhaps because Cannes is just around
the corner in early May, offering higher kudos for superior products. Or
perhaps because Berlin is still seeking an identity, now that the fallen
Wall has robbed the event of its political dialectic.
Until 1990 this festival stood by the tennis net of Euro-politics, a
cultural umpire to the game of East versus West. Today the balls whizzing by
come from all quarters, in all shapes, sizes and colours. Hooray that the
Cold War spirit and structure have been swept aside. But Berlin badly needs
a new identity if it not to become merely Cannes the Prequel: situated too
close in time and too far in place, in a frozen North - and Kong is mantled
in snow as I speak - which few will prefer to the sunnier, more
movie-bountiful Cote d'Azur.
