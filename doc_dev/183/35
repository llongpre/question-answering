<LEADPARA>  IN WRITING this column it's nice to know that when I get stumped, I can put
the question out to readers and somebody always has an answer.;   I didn't
have an answer for the question, "Where could I obtain plans for a windmill
that will pump water?" but reader Charlie Hafner of Fremont did. He suggests
sending $1 for a catalog of plans for building a wide variety of home, farm
and ranch products to: Lindsay Technical Publications, P.O. Box 538, Bradley,
Ill. 60915; (815) 935-5353. Hafner also notes that there is an association of
windmill collectors that publishes a quarterly newsletter. Windmillers'
Gazette, P.O. Box 507, Rio Vista, Texas 76093, is $10 for a one-year
subscription.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When a reader asked about a shower head that resembled the head on a garden
watering can, I drew a complete blank.;   Reader Jolene Silva of San Francisco
responded with a photocopy of a catalog page showing a "sunflower showerhead,"
that looks exactly like the head on a watering can. The antique reproduction
head is available from The Antique Hardware Store, RD2, Box A, Route 611,
Kintnersville, Penn. 18930; (800) 422-9982.; Q How do I remove old foam
weatherstripping tape from a door frame? The foam is gummy in some spots and
seems to be baked to the molding.; A Remove as much of the foam as possible by
pulling it off. This will expose the tape that was used to adhere the foam to
the door frame. Heat the tape with a hair dryer and scrape the tape with a
flat piece of soft wood. Tapering the end on a wood paint stirring stick works
well or you can use a plastic putty knife to slowly scrape the heated tape
away. The residue that remains can be cleaned away by using 99 percent
isopropyl alcohol on a cloth.; Q I'm about to sell my house and would like to
wax or in some way put a finish over the plastic counter tops in the kitchen.
What will do this?; A Restoring plastic laminate is difficult, but I think
you'll see some improvement by polishing the surface with Meguiar's Mirror
Glaze 10 Professional Plastic Polish. Follow this with a few coats of
Kleenmaster Brillianize. Both are available from companies that sell acrylic
plastics or from some auto or motorcycle parts stores.; Q I'm told that some
company manufactures furnace registers that come in different colors so they
don't need to be painted, but I can't find them anywhere.; A You'll find wall
registers in rose, cream, blue, tan, gray and brass shown in the Sears Mobile
Home catalog. However, they are only available to fit 8-by-4-inch and
10-by-4-inch openings. I suspect you are trying to avoid the paint build-up
the comes from rolling on or brushing paint on registers. Consider buying
registers from a hardware, home center or heating and air-conditioning
company, and spraying them with a good quality finish.;   You can find floor
registers in oak, brass and chrome at hardware stores and home centers.  </TEXT>
