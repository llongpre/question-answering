   Richard Mulligan, whose characters are often
on the threshold of madness, is the straight man in his new NBC
comedy series ``Empty Nest.''
   He plays a pediatrician whose wife has recently died and left
him with three grown daughters, at least two of whom are neurotic,
a nurse whose heart is still in Appalachia and a next-door-neighbor
who is a freeloader and free with advice.
   Mulligan is the perfectly normal one. Okay, so he talks to his
dog, but who doesn't?
   This is the Richard Mulligan who brought inspired lunacy to Burt
Campbell on ``Soap,'' went to pieces in the movie ``S.O.B.,'' made
Col. George A. Custer a case study in abnormal psychology in
``Little Big Man,'' and in ``Teachers'' was the looney who walked
into the school and started teaching.
   ``He's certainly different from my role on `Soap,''' Mulligan
says, noting that producer-writer Susan Harris created both series.
``This guy's a good doctor who cares deeply about his patients.
He's a good fellow trying to take care of his daughters. His wife
died 18 months ago and he still can't take the ring off.''
   Even as a straight man, reacting to the craziness going on
around him, Mulligan can't help being funny. His long, expressive
face, slapped together out of Silly Putty, has a direct line to the
funny bone. His talks to Dreyfuss, a lovable, monstrous mixture of
golden retriever and Saint Bernard, come off as dialogues. The
clown-faced Dreyfuss, like a canine version of Mulligan, reacts
with almost human emotions.
   The show, a spinoff from ``Golden Girls,'' also stars Dinah
Manoff and Kristy McNichol as his daughters, Park Overall as his
nurse, David Leisure as his neighbor and a dog named Bear as
Dreyfuss. The third daughter is away at college, but calls
frequently for help.
   ``Bear is very sweet and very smart,'' says Mulligan. ``There's
a lot of kidding on the set because he gets a little reward after
every scene. Now all the actors are demanding rewards. Bear even
has a double, his brother, Julio.''
   The idea for ``Empty Nest'' first appeared a few years ago as an
episode of ``Golden Girls.'' Paul Dooley and Rita Moreno starred as
husband and wife.
   ``It was originally about a father and mother whose children
have left the nest,'' says Mulligan. ``They look at each other and
say, `What now?' Then Susan came up with the idea of the widower.
That gave it more dimensions somehow. It became bittersweet, yet
funny.''
   Although the new show is a spinoff from ``Golden Girls,'' there
are no immediate plans for any crossover. Mulligan's character
lives in the same Miami neighborhood, so it's expected that at some
time in the future one of the ladies will pay a visit. Perhaps
Blanche will make a play for the doctor. Or the pediatrician may
treat Sophia and give her a lollipop.
   Mulligan grew up in the Bronx with ambitions of becoming a
playwright. His brother, Robert, is a director (``To Kill a
Mockingbird''). He studied playwriting at Columbia University, but
was soon turned toward acting.
   ``Empty Nest'' is his fifth series. In his first, ``The Hero,''
in 1966-67, he was a movie Western star who was afraid of horses
and was anything but a hero off-screen. Next came a small role as a
mystery writer in ``Diana,'' which starred Diana Rigg in 1973-74.
``Soap'' ran four years and made him a star, but his next series,
``Reggie,'' in 1983 was a quick flop.
   Mulligan these days is usually seen as a comic performer,
although he did do a straight dramatic role in the NBC miniseries
``Gore Vidal's Lincoln.''
   ``There was a time in the theater in New York nobody would give
me a comedy role,'' he says. ``I'd play in O`Neill or Tennessee
Williams. Once I was in Charlie's, an old theater bar, and I
couldn't convince anyone I could do comedy.
   ``Then I heard Gene Sax was going to do `Nobody Loves an
Albatross' and I auditioned for the role as the ghostwriter. I got
it. And I was good. So good, in fact, I had trouble getting
dramatic parts.''
