<HEAD>`Heartbeat' Is New Prime-Time Soap Set in Women's Clinic</HEAD>

   Because shows such as ``Dynasty'' must tiptoe
around sex talk, Aaron Spelling Productions has set its new ABC
show ``Heartbeat'' in a women's clinic, where it can be right out
in the open, couched in the glow of healthy openness.
   Oh, please, ``St. Elsewhere,'' come back!
   Tonight's two-hour premiere features difficult childbirths,
artificial insemination and numerous gynecological exams. To start
off, there's an emergency birth that requires forceps and incisions.
   Oh, honey, bring in the potato chips!
   Kate Mulgrew plays hapless, overworked Dr. Joanne Springsteen,
who founded the clinic with Dr. Eve Autry (Laura Johnson, who is
married to Harry Hamlin of ``L.A. Law''). Ben Masters plays Dr. Leo
Rosetti, a pediatrician and object of Joanne's lust.
   Ray Baker is psychologist Stan Gorshalk, who counsels the
hospital's patients in matters psycho-sexual. In tonight's episode,
he confides to another doctor that he and his wife haven't had sex
in nine weeks. And the cobbler's children have no shoes.
   The show wants to offer up-to-date health information, like
tonight's debate over mastectomy vs. lumpectomy in cases of breast
cancer. Women's fears are unlikely to be assuaged by Gorshalk's
argument that patient Wendy (Kathleen Wilhoite) should be
encouraged to face the fact that she very well might die. That
should have 'em flocking in for mammograms.
   Meanwhile, a couple who can't conceive are advised by the
leering ``fertility specialist'' (Darrell Larson) to go for
artificial insemination. After the procedure _ yes, we get to be
there _ the nurse practitioner (Gail Strickland) gently suggests
orgasm aids in successful implantation, and leaves the woman in a
darkened examination room alone.
   In between trying to hit the sheets with Leo, Joanne contends
with a friend who's pursuing a career and can't be bothered with an
``incompetent cervix,'' meaning the baby will be born prematurely
if she walks around too much. Joanne saves the day by borrowing a
newborn from the nursery to convince the expectant mom she should
stay in bed at least until the baby can be safely delivered after
the next commercial.
   Meanwhile, Eve confronts Wendy's sexist family doctor, who
thinks Wendy ought to have a radical mastectomy instead of a
lumpectomy. What good is a breast, anyway, says the doc? It's
``just a piece of fat.'' Huffs glamorous Eve in her spandex dress,
``So are some of your body parts. Would you like to chop them off
and replace them with silly putty?''
   Some bad taste seems unintentional. Dr. Cory Banks (Lynn
Whitfield) is in a crisis because her husband is off on a building
job in Mexico, causing her to remark, ``Sometimes I wish that whole
construction project would get swallowed up in an earthquake.''
   With any luck, ``Heartbeat'' will get swallowed up by bad
ratings.

   It is with great relief that Thursday finds ``The Days and
Nights of Molly Dodd'' back for another spring run on NBC.
   Fans of Jay Tarses' touching, offbeat half-hour comedy, which
premiered last spring for a limited run, will be glad to know, as
Molly's mom reassures in voiceover at the beginning of the episode,
that Molly ``continues to bang her knees against the cruel
furniture of life.''
   In the first new show, ``Here's Why You Shouldn't Get Too
Attached to Your Cat,'' Molly gets a new job, working in a
cluttered bookstore for a befuddled but engaging bookworm, Moss
Goodman (David Strathairn).
   And her friend Nina (Maureen Anderman) is burglarized. ``Do you
know what it's like to come home and find your apartment ransacked,
underwear hanging out of the drawers?'' rages Nina. ``Yes,'' says
Molly, ``but I'm a bad example.''
   Enter Molly's new love interest, Detective Nathaniel Hawthorne
(Richard Lawson). Replies Nina upon being introduced to him,
``Hello. I'm policewoman Elizabeth Barrett Browning.''
