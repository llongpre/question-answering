Rufus Stone is unlikely to forget the day he received an early-morning phone
call from a tea planter in Assam. Wild elephants were using the timbers
supporting his main tea-grading shed as scratching posts. One building had
already collapsed and his staff feared for their lives.
The caller had heard of a magic potion called Curb that would repel the
intruders if sprayed on the buildings. Could Rufus send some some urgently?
The carefully-contrived cocktail was urgently despatched, and proved
effective. The elephants went.
Stone's company, Sphere Laboratories (London), has dealt with tigers in
Malaysia, gerbils in Israeli desert settlements, pigeons in Trafalgar
Square, moles in parks and sports grounds, and, recently, football pitch
invasions for Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers. Both clubs'
newly-laid turf were being damaged by birds.
Lt Colonel Rufus Stone RE has done many things. He was born 81 years ago on
a farm in mid-Devon and has worked as a seaman, an inspector in the
Metropolitan Police and a regular soldier. During the war he worked on the
Mulberry Harbour off the coast of Normandy during and after the D-Day
landings in 1944.
He has no formal training but has worked as an agricultural feedstuff
salesman, an engineering designer, a consulting engineer and a surveyor.
From 1959-63 he worked for the Cyanamid Corporation as UK general manager
and then as European director of the agricultural, foodstuffs and veterinary
division.
Soon after he was made redundant by Cyanamid at 51, a chance meeting in a
London pub led to a request for him to tackle the problem of horses
*something in here (HP) *
chewing the woodwork in their stables at a racing stud.
'I had always been passionately fond of animals, but from my experience in
the veterinary and agro-pharmaceutical field I had also developed a pretty
good idea of what substances they found repellant,' said Stone, who runs the
one-man business from his 16th-century cottage in the village of Chilton on
the Berkshire Downs.
'I did a bit of ringing round and experimented with a substance I concocted,
based on aluminium ammonium sulphate. It was a powder mixed with water that
I painted on the looseboxes. After a bit of experimentation I managed to
find a formulation that worked.
'I had a hunch that I was on to something big, so in 1967 I took out
patents, and registered the main product under the name Curb.
'Then, without doing any formal marketing - all I did was some phoning round
 -I managed to interest a host of important people in the agricultural and
horticultural world. Some people in the field of domestic animal repellants
heard about Curb and were attracted by the powder form.
'I soon realised that Curb would stop pigs from tailbiting, birds from
pecking crops, dogs from fouling footpaths and rats from jumping on poultry
and killing their victims.'
Soon he was selling Curb to seed companies, local authorities, government
departments, and export agents.
'All sorts of big companies buy it from me and sell it under a variety of
fancy names. It also sells under different names in France, Germany, Italy,
Austria and in the East,' Stone said.
The patents cost Stone Pounds 7,500 and covered 25 countries, but they
proved to be the wisest move he made.
'I raised Pounds 15,000 from a loan company - the only money I have ever
borrowed - to help me develop the enterprise at this important stage and you
could say the sphere was really rolling,' he said.
Sphere has been rolling productively - and profitably - ever since. Stone
can be seen at all hours mixing his secret potion in the 2,000 sq ft
industrial unit - a former wartime explosives and mixing store at Milton
Park near Abingdon that he has rented since 1970.
'It is only four miles from my house so I just drive down and mix to order.
If there is a rush I have a few part-time helpers I can call upon.
'Annual production is about 50 tons and at Pounds 2,000 a ton that means I
turn over about Pounds 100,000. Profit runs at 20-25 per cent of turnover
and my main overheads are materials at about Pounds 20,000 a year and my
annual rent, which is Pounds 12,000.'
But after 30 years of making and selling Curb doesn't he want to do
something new?
'I find it so interesting that I never want to retire. My father was playing
golf to a 16 handicap at 86, although I have given up riding and shooting I
should like to develop the company further,' Stone said.
'I find the calls I get and the problems to be solved immensely fascinating.
I have given papers at scientific meetings in the USA and Europe, and I meet
all sorts of interesting people on my troubleshooting trips in this country.
'A few months ago I had phone calls from Sweden and Eire on the same day.
Both callers rang to tell me they had discovered Curb will stop birds
pecking putty out of window frames. Soon after the big putty manufacturers
got on to me. Now I sell to them, and so it goes on.'
There are two more things Stone wants to do. The first is to make his
stepsons, Sean and Simon, who he hopes will take over the business, fully
conversant with Curb's secret formula. The second is to develop neem oil, a
natural extract from India.
'The insect-repellant qualities of this substance have been known to mankind
since 500 years before Christ, but it has yet to be exploited to its full
potential,' he said.
'It will repel, and if necessary kill, just about every type of insect known
to man. The Americans are now growing it and say it is going to be very big
in harmless insect control over the next 100 years. Some experts say it has
a part to play in preventing the spread of HIV, while it can also be used to
repel organisms that cause barnacles to form on the outside of ships.
'I am keen for the British to exploit neem oil. All I need is to find
somebody with a few million to put into it.'
