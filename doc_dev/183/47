<DESCRIPT>  CALIFORNIA; GOVERNOR; LEGISLATURE; FORECAST; BUDGET  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  California's largest tax increase and severe cuts in state spending could be
ready for final legislative approval by Friday, Gov. Pete Wilson and
legislative leaders announced Saturday after a closed-door budget summit.;   
Neither Wilson nor the top two leaders in the Assembly and Senate provided any
details about what fuels their optimism for resolving the $14.3 billion
deficit -- the biggest ever faced by any state -- by week's end.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BUDGET ACCORD NEAR, WILSON, LEGISLATORS SAY
LARGEST TAX INCREASE, SHARP CUTS EXPECTED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     However, it appeared that Wilson's proposal to raise various taxes by $6.9
billion -- and no more -- remains intact in return for compromises on cuts he
proposed for education and welfare.;    Still on the table for discussion --
and a potential political powder keg -- is a plan to lay off 10,000 state
employees, according to today's edition of the Los Angeles Times.;    "I think
what finally hit is a pretty clear understanding of the dimensions of the
problems," said Wilson, the group's appointed spokesman. "We are going to have
to do some things that are very unpleasant in order to avoid essentially
shutting down state government.";    Sources familiar with Saturday's
bargaining session said Wilson, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, D-San
Francisco, Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti, D-Los Angeles, and Assembly
Republican Leader Ross Johnson, R-Fullerton, are now working from a sheet of
budget numbers crafted by Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy, R-Fresno.;   
And while budget intimates agree that the Maddy plan is still subject to major
revision, it provides the framework for face-saving compromise:;    (check) It
relies chiefly on Wilson's plan to boost the state's 6 percent sales tax to
7.25 percent, eliminating a week-old proposal to tax entertainment tickets and
end the interest deductions on second homes.;    Proposition 98;    (check) It
preserves the schools' funding formula -- outlined in voter-approved
Proposition 98 -- that sends 40 percent of general fund revenues to education.
Wilson, who wanted to cut education by $2 billion, had called for Proposition
98's suspension. Democrats vowed to protect it.;    However, even if
Proposition 98 remains intact, schools still stand to lose about $1 billion.; 
  (check) The fledgling agreement would roughly halve Wilson's plan to cut
welfare grants by 8.8 percent, calling instead for a 4 percent cut in Aid to
Families with Dependent Children.;    (check) Wilson wanted to eliminate the
state's $38.5 million homeless assistance program. Saturday's plan would
preserve half its funding.;    "They are within hundreds of millions of
dollars of a deal," said one knowledgeable staffer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.;    Wilson and the leaders are to resume secret bargaining Monday
morning, and hope to announce a detailed agreement on the budget's substance
as early as Monday afternoon.;    "Our schedule is to bring to a vote -- a
final vote -- by next Friday the budget for the year '91-'92," Wilson said
after his ninth secret meeting with legislative leaders.;    Wilson said a
procedural vote needed to pave the way for final approval probably will take
place Wednesday.;    "The only thing I can tell you is that there is some hard
negotiating going on," the Republican governor said. "We are faced on both
sides with having to do some very unpleasant things. This has been described
as a budget that will contain something for everyone to hate. And that begins
to describe it.";    Because of a flagging economy and unprecedented demand
for state health, welfare, education and correctional services, Wilson
proposed in April his $6.9 billion bundle of taxes.;    Budget standoff;   
Assembly Republicans have balked at those increases. Democrats wanted more of
them -- and fewer cuts -- setting up a weeks-long budget standoff.;    Roberti
issued a statement that seemed to recognize the political difficulty of
winning agreement on a $55.7 billion budget in five days.;    "That's
certainly our goal," he said. "But it may be optimistic.";    Privately,
senior legislative aides were more skeptical and more blunt.;    "Wilson is
fond of setting deadlines -- artificial deadlines -- all along," said one
aide. "I think this is his way to set another deadline and jam it to the
legislative if they don't make it. There's a hell of a lot that is
undecided.";    Wilson said there is urgency to the Legislature's work because
he still believes there is time to get the sales tax in place by July 1.
Wilson's budget aides said Friday they already have written off the $350
million in sales tax revenue for that month because 30 days of lead time is
needed to get them on the books.;    "We are compelled to act to avoid making
what is now a $14 billion-plus hole even deeper," said Wilson, adding later:
"It's just not an acceptable situation.";    Clouding Wilson's rosy
predictions for budgetary breakthrough is the 31-member Assembly GOP caucus,
which last week said it is solidly against Wilson's tax plan. It unveiled a $4
billion spending reduction plan late last week that Democrats ridiculed as
"silly putty."  </TEXT>
