For years I've been pushing polyester auto body filler as one of the best 
materials there is for filling holes, dents, cracks and gouges in wood. 
Reasons? It's easy to apply. It sets up in a matter of minutes, never shrinks 
or cracks no matter how large the repair, it sands easily and finishes very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Its only real drawback? Depending upon the brand you buy, it usually comes out 
a gray or dirty grayish pink. That's not exactly the shade you'd look for if 
you want a good wood-tone color match under a clear finish. For this reason, I 
normally use the stuff only when I plan to subsequently cover it up, with 
either a couple coats of paint or perhaps some plastic laminate. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, however, Minwax came out with a product called High Performance 
Wood Filler. Like polyester auto body filler, it comes in two parts: a can of 
putty and a tube of hardener. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as I saw it on the hardware store shelf, I surreptitiously popped open 
the can and took a look. A quick sniff revealed the telltale odor of polyester. 
The color was, if not a perfect wood-tone, at least in the neighborhood. I'd 
call it a warm, brownish gray. Not only that, according to the label, this 
stuff could be stained! Although it cost about three times as much as auto body 
filler, it sounded good. I decided to buy a can and compare it to my old 
standby. 
</P>
<P>
I quickly discovered that it handles just like auto body filler. As with auto 
body filler, the goo in the can is composed of a liquid resin combined with 
powdered fillers to create a puttylike material. As with body filler, the two 
components tend to separate with storage so it pays to stir the can before use. 
</P>
<P>
After stirring, scoop out a blob big enough to handle the job you have in mind, 
and mix it with a bit of the hardener from the separate squeeze tube. Body 
fillers usually come with a rusty red hardener. This makes it easy to see when 
you've done a good job of mixing, but it also gives you that dirty pink color 
mentioned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The hardener with the Minwax filler is basically colorless. This makes it a bit 
harder to judge how well you've mixed your putty, but it also avoids that 
sickly grayish pink. 
</P>
<P>
Once either product is mixed with its hardener, you should apply it without 
delay. Depending upon how much hardener you've used, and the ambient 
temperature, the mix may set up pretty quickly. Use a flexible putty knife and 
hold it at a low angle. This helps force the putty into the defect you are 
filling. 
</P>
<P>
Since neither product shrinks, there's no need to overfill as you must with 
many other products. Just smooth the filler on and level. Avoid holding the 
knife at a steep angle, however. This tends to drag the filler out of the 
defect and you won't get a level coverage. 
</P>
<P>
On with the tests. Once my samples were mixed, I applied them to shallow 
one-inch holes drilled into ordinary pine. Ten minutes later, when the samples 
had set up, I tried staining them. According to the Minwax directions, you 
should sand the filler lightly with 100-grit paper (finer paper closes the 
pores of the filler so it takes less stain) and apply your stain while the 
filler is freshly cured. You should then let the stain penetrate for an hour 
before wiping off the excess. I followed those directions on the Minwax filler, 
using a Minwax stain. And while I was at it, I tried the same procedure on my 
grayish pink auto body filler samples. 
</P>
<P>
Results? To my surprise, once the stain was on, there wasn't much difference in 
color between the two products. The auto body filler was just a tad pinker than 
the Minwax filler, but to be honest, neither was really a very good match for 
the color of the stained pine surrounding the test patches. 
</P>
<P>
Of course you will probably get different results with different stains and 
different woods, but my initial reaction is that neither body filler nor the 
Minwax wood filler is a good choice if you want an accurate color match under a 
clear finish. For accurate color matching, you'll probably get a better job 
with stick shellac, or a product such as Plastic Wood, especially if you take 
the time to blend two or more colors together to get the exact shade you like. 
</P>
<P>
But for filling under paints or laminates, for repairing plaster and wallboard, 
for anchoring screws, and working indoor or out, polyester fillers are still my 
first choice. And given its clear-cut price advantage, I'll stick with ordinary 
auto body filler, stuff with names such as Bondo, White Lightning or Black 
Knight.
