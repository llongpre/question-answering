<LEADPARA>  A NEW 45-minute videotape, "Installing Kitchen Cabinets and Countertops"
(Taunton Press, $19.95), will make it easier for homeowners to either hang
their own cabinets or be sidewalk superintendents if a contractor does the
job.;    Carpenter Tom Law gives one of the most thorough step-by-step
demonstrations I've seen on how to get cabinets plumb and level, and how to
handle problems of uneven wall and floor surfaces. The tape is well-produced
so even the most novice do-it-yourselfer will find it understandable.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The tape is available from bookstores; some building centers or building
supply stores; or by mail from Video Tools in San Jose, (408) 287-8509; or
Taunton Press, (800) 283-7252.;    Q The cast plastic top to my bathroom
vanity is dull. Is there anything that will restore shine to the surface?; A
Maybe not restore, but certainly improve is the job done by Plasti-Sheen,
manufactured by Glasgow Products Corp. of Atlanta. The liquid polishing
compound, originally formulated for polishing motorcycle helmets and plastic
windshields, has attained equal success on cultured marble and acrylic tub and
shower surfaces.;    Don't use it on areas where a person would stand as it
produces a slippery surface. It's stocked in 16-ounce cans at the Home Depot
stores.;    Q How can I stop a banging noise coming from my gas hot water
heater?;    A You most likely have a buildup of lime or other minerals in the
tank. First, write to Master Fit, 7250 S. Cicero Ave., Chicago, Ill. 60629 and
request a copy of Form 4861, which gives detailed information on the use of
Mag-Erad, a tank cleaner.;    You will need to purchase one pound of Mag-Erad
for up to a 40-gallon tank, 2 pounds for up to a 50 gallon tank. Mag-Erad is
available from hardware and plumbing supply stores. If you follow the
instructions carefully (you may need to repeat the cleaning for the best
results), you should solve the noise problem.;    Once the tank is clean,
remove about a gallon of water from it each month to help keep the mineral
buildup to a minimum.;    Q What can I use to protect the wall above a
tub-shower combination? Paint doesn't last because of steam and poor
ventilation in the room.;    A Buy a Plaskolite "Easy Wall" Bathtub Wall Kit.
It contains flat plastic panels designed for use in tubs and showers. The
panels are glued to a clean, mold and mildew-free surface with a compatible
construction adhesive.;    If you're unable to locate the kit, write or call
Plaskolite Inc., 1770 Joyce Ave., Columbus, Ohio 43216, (614) 294-3281, for
the name of a supplier near you. You also should give serious thought to
improving the ventilation in the room.;    Q The surface of the concrete on my
porch is very slippery when wet. What's the best way to rough up concrete and
still have it look good?;    A You could use concrete etch, an acid available
from hardware stores. However, it can damage any adjacent painted surfaces.
Also, the treated concrete can sometimes appear uneven.;    I recommend that
you get bids from three companies that do on-site sandblasting. You will find
them listed in the Yellow Pages under "Sandblasting.";    Be sure that the
contractor is licensed and carries sufficient insurance to cover possible
damage to adjoining surfaces, windows, even nearby vehicles.;    Q My
fireplace and chimney were damaged during the October 1989 earthquake. A
contractor built new ones, but I can't use the fireplace because smoke comes
into the room. The contractor added on to the chimney to no avail. Is there a
solution?;    A Assuming that the chimney was properly designed, that the
installer was a qualified brick mason, and that it was built to code with a
building permit and inspections, there are still several possible solutions.; 
  Check that the chimney flue is clear of debris. Install a chimney cap with
spark arrester to minimize downdrafts that can cause smoke to be blown into a
room. If these measures don't help, it's possible that the fireplace opening
is too large and will need to be reduced. If none of the corrections work,
consider installing a wood- or gas-burning fireplace insert.;    Q What can I
use to fill a small hole that was accidentally punched into the leg of a
table?;    A Wax base materials that resemble a child's crayon will fill nail
holes. An alternative is to use children's color crayons. Melt one or more
crayons to achieve the best color match, then let it cool. Cooling is
necessary so that the crayon is soft like putty and easier to handle.;   
Next, push the filler into the hole with a small stick. When the hole is
filled to slightly above the surrounding surface, shave the top even with the
side of a credit card. When smooth, apply two coats of a good-quality
furniture wax.;    Q What is the best glue to use when gluing raw wood to
Formica (plastic laminate)? I want to build some cabinets from sheets of
presswood that have the laminate already glued to two faces.;    A I doubt you
are working with sheets of presswood or particle board surfaced with a
high-pressure laminate such as Formica or Wilsonart. The surface is probably
covered with a low-pressure laminate or vinyl. Low-pressure laminate can be
glued with contact cement or epoxy. However, if vinyl, it may require a
special adhesive. You would need to have your lumber supplier get that
recommendation from the material's manufacturer.;    Check "European
Cabinetry: Design &amp; Construction," by Jim Christ (Sterling Publishing, $17.95)
for detailed information on cabinet construction.  </TEXT>
