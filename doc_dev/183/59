<LEADPARA>  Q I'd like to pickle some pine paneling in the basement. Can I do it over the
old varnish? I don't mind the knots showing through the pickled finish. How is
it done?;    A You can't pickle over any finish, so you have to sand it off to
the bare wood. Then get some flat, white latex wall paint and thin it down
with water. How much you thin it down depends on how much white you want to
show on the wood. In fact, you can start off with unthinned paint; paint it on
a scrap piece of pine, and before it dries, wipe it off with a cloth. If there
is too much white, thin the paint. Thin down a small amount, and remember the
ratio of water you add to the paint, then apply it to scrap pine and wipe it
off. When you find the pickling effect you like, mix up a whole batch of
paint, apply it and wipe it off. After the white dries, apply one or two coats
of semigloss urethane varnish.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q I had my kitchen cabinets refinished, and the man used clear lacquer. The
finish now has a lot of "holidays" (spots where the finish missed), and the
finish is not even. He returned to fix things, but that didn't work, either.
Can I apply shellac or urethane varnish to finish them up?;    A It is not a
good idea to mix finishes, so I would steer clear of shellac or varnish. You
should be able to buy brushing lacquer to apply. It dries very quickly, and if
you aren't careful, your brush can get stuck in the lacquer. So, try brushing
on scrap wood. A second, full, thin coat should clear up those holidays and
produce a consistent gloss.;    Q I am having trouble getting masking tape off
painted wood. What's an easy way? Will heat work?;    A Heat might do it; try
a hair dryer. A hot-air gun will help, too, but you have to be careful that
you don't soften the paint. Apply heat, and scrape lightly with a putty knife.
To remove the glue residue, wipe with paint thinner or rubbing alcohol. If
neither works, try Dow's Bug and Tar remover. Another way to get the tape
itself off is to work a bit of the bug remover behind the tape and pull or
scrape slowly.;    Q Some areas of my outside windowsills are rotted, and not
all the way through the wood. How can I fill them permanently?;    A Gouge out
the decay until the hole shows only sound wood. Wet the areas with bleach and
water (to kill any remaining fungus, which is what started the decay in the
first place), let dry and fill the voids with epoxy wood filler. Smooth it
off, let it set, sand smooth and paint the entire sill with an exterior oil
primer, finishing with an oil-based or latex house paint. The decay may have
occurred from water building up between the inside window and the storm
window; this happens when rain comes in the screen during the summer. Normally
there are small weep holes at the bottom of the aluminum storm frame, to allow
water to drain out. If there are none, drill 1/8-inch holes at the bottom of
the aluminum storm frame; one about 4 inches in from each side. If weep holes
are already there, make sure they are open and stay open.;    Q I am restoring
a brass and copper fire extinguisher to use as a lamp base. I removed the
tarnish with Noxon, but I can't get the metal to shine. I don't want to
scratch the metal, but I am stumped.;    A Noxon and other brass and copper
cleaners need power buffing when they are used. Buy a buffing bonnet for an
electric drill, apply more Noxon and buff until the metal shines. Another way
to do it is to scrub with Brillo or SOS pads. The brass is unlikely to
scratch, but the copper might, so be careful. To keep the metal shiny, apply a
clear plastic spray or high-gloss urethane varnish.  </TEXT>
