   So what if the mares don't care? Robins
Parteebuilt is a stud, and his owners care. They want the stallion
to look his best.
   So a plastic surgeon who normally works on patients of the
two-legged variety was summoned to repair the dent in 11-year-old
Robins Parteebuilt's forehead.
   The stallion, nicknamed Partee, got the dent in 1989 when he
galloped head-first into a fence post. This week, a team at the
University of Illinois veterinary school filled in the mark with a
sort of body putty.
   ``This is one of the top 10 sires of halter horses in the nation
- a precious animal,'' said owner Roger DeWitt of Gillespie.
   University veterinarians had patched Partee's face as best they
could in 1989, using wires to hold together broken bones.
   But when it came to a face as pretty as Partee's - the subject
of oohs and aahs at the university clinic - the veterinarians
decided a plastic surgeon was needed.
   They called in Dr. Jim Sheridan from Carle Clinic in Urbana. One
of his specialties is repairing faces.
   It took 19 people using a hoist to get the anesthetized,
1,350-pound stallion onto the operating table.
   ``Boy, he's a handsome dog,'' veterinary surgeon Gordon Baker
said after the dent was filled in. And everyone in the operating
room agreed.
