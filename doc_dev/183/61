<LEADPARA>  IT'S not his only talent, but Jeff Bryant can manipulate his hair like Silly
Putty.;   It all started when this up-and-coming Saratoga actor got the part
of Tim in "Angry Housewives" in August 1989. Tim, being a now kind of kid, had
a now kind of haircut, mowed around the ears and zany on the top.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So Bryant went off to the barber-; shop for a modified flattop and came out
with a strange-looking approximation. (What you see on the right, his official
"head shot" or audition portrait, was taken just before this happened.) "The
barber was obviously drunk," he said. "How can you mess up a flattop?";  
Things got worse. The hair grew back orange and its genial curl became fierce
and intractable. "The hair demons took over," says Bryant, pushing his fingers
through his hair, which proceeded to stand straight up on end.;   Greetings
from Brooklyn;   For "Brighton Beach Memoirs," which closes today at San Jose
Stage Company, the hair had to take on a new identity. The play takes place in
1937, when a Brooklyn Jewish kid would have been trying to repress his hair's
personality. "It has a serious part," says Bryant, meaning the dividing line
in the hair. To get the proper obedience, he slicks it down with grease.;  
Other than hair, Bryant has remarkably few worries -- for an actor. He's going
right from one part into another: After "Brighton Beach," it's straight into
rehearsal for a revival of "Angry Housewives." (San Jose Stage's long-running
hit opens Thursday at the Julia Morgan Theater in Berkeley for a six-week
run.);   Meanwhile, he also has a featured role in an ABC movie, "Stranger in
the Family," airing tonight at 9 on channels 7 (KGO) and 11 (KNTV). It stars
Neil Patrick Harris, a.k.a. Doogie Howser, as an amnesia victim and Teri Garr
as his mother.;   And he's about to hit Bay Area television traffic in a big
way, in a Northern California commercial for the Toyota Dealers Association.
Accompanied by the snarl of "Wild Thing," he plays a biker. His hair is again
featured.;   For the long term, San Jose Stage has promised him the rest of
Neil Simon's autobiographical trilogy, "Biloxi Blues" and "Broadway Bound,"
over the next two seasons. (This will put him one up on Matthew Broderick, who
played the first two installments but was too old by the time "Broadway Bound"
came along.);   Bryant is as cheerful and irrepressible as 23-year-old actors
come, which is to say, about as much as eight puppies just let out in the
backyard for the first time.;   "I'm going to be older soon enough, and I
might as well do these roles while I can," he said. "As an actor, you have to
draw on your experience. I know what it's like being young!";   He's most of
the way toward a theater degree at San Jose State University, but it's
currently on hold because he's been working while his classmates have been in
class.;   "I'd be a fool to turn down guaranteed employment," he says. "People
say: 'I'm an artist, I'm an actor, I must be taken seriously' -- and they're
not working. . . . You've got to be an artist to have that sensibility, but
you've got to work to get it.";   The son of Jeff and Betsy Bryant of
Saratoga, Jeffrey Francis Bryant gets his bounce from his mother, a busy
political and marketing consultant and a member of several arts boards. Jeff
Bryant Sr. is a manager at Trimble Navigation in Sunnyvale. Together, they run
a small business called Alliance Industries, which makes walk-in refrigerators
and environmental test chambers.;   "My father hates the kind of social
gatherings my mom drags him to," Bryant says. "He's the kind of guy who goes
in the corner and draws doodles of everyone at the party.";   The grade-school
thespian;   Though he performed with San Jose Children's Musical Theater as a
kid, he considers that he became an actor in the seventh grade. This came
about when he went for sports only to find that sports didn't go for him. "I
was too short for basketball, and I kept getting my jump shots slammed back in
my face. I tried wrestling, and I was always the guy who got pinned in two
seconds.";   So he tried out for the school musical, "Damn Yankees," and got
the part of the Devil. "I was lucky. I found what I wanted to do at a very
young age," he says, sounding owlish and experienced.;   From there, Bryant
was cast as the Artful Dodger in San Jose Civic Light Opera's "Oliver!"
(1986), the dual roles of Nana, the St. Bernard dog, and the crocodile in
"Peter Pan" (1988) and Baby John in "West Side Story" (1989). He also played
the kid in San Jose Stage's "Torch Song Trilogy" (1987) and got a recurring
role on "Midnight Caller," which gained him the coveted Screen Actors Guild
card, entry token to the world of film.;   Then he took over the role of Tim
in "Angry Housewives," where he played 370 performances, had four different
mothers -- Michelle Jenee, Jeffra Cook, Mary Wing Porter and Christine Wait --
over 17 months and got his Actors Equity Association card, entry token to the
world of professional theater.;   Trying to manage school and work took its
toll. There was the night he fell asleep drumming during the late show of
"Angry Housewives." "I wasn't really asleep, I was just kind of running on
automatic pilot," he says, unfocusing his eyes.;   At the same time, "I've
done some terrible work in studio productions at San Jose State," he says.
"Like I was in this production of 'Bent' (a play about the Nazi persecution of
homosexuals). Everyone was good but me. The only moment I was believable was
when I was throwing up blood on stage.";   After "Angry Housewives" finishes
in Berkeley, Bryant's goal is to graduate from college -- "I've stuck it out
this long. I'm not gonna spend all this money on an education and not walk
away without at least a piece of paper" -- and take a trip to Thailand with
his best friend, actor Leith Burke.;   And one of these days, he may look old
enough to play roles other than boys.;   "The next step will come when I have
to shave every day," he says. (box); Angry Housewives; Producer: San Jose
