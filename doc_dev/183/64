<TEXT>  A A Handyman knife works well to break the seal around the sash and between
each window. However, my experience has been that if there is a lot of
accumulated paint the knife blade will travel and you can end up damaging the
woodwork.;    Wear eye goggles and heavy gloves as protection against possible
glass breakage. To minimize blade slippage, heat the paint before cutting. Be
careful not to heat the glass as it may crack.;    Once you've opened a gap
around the sash, insert a rigid putty knife, levered over a small block of
scrap wood, and gently but firmly pry around the entire sash to loosen the
window. Gentle taps with a rubber mallet might also help.;    Remove the
windows and clean away all excess paint, make any necessary repairs and make
sure they are operating smoothly before repainting.;    Once you've gone
through this tedious process, I can guarantee you that you'll never paint a
window shut.; Q I'm building a furniture kit that uses exposed brass screw
heads as part of the design. The directions say to predrill the screw holes,
which I've done, but I've still ended up with damaged screw slots and one
screw broken. Any suggestions?; A I'm assuming that the wood screws are of
good quality and that you are predrilling the proper size hole. Try this: Use
steel screws that are the same size as the brass ones to cut threads into the
wood, remove them, and then screw in the brass screws.;    Whenever you drive
screws be sure that you use a screwdriver with a blade that closely matches
the size of the screw slot to minimize slot damage. You also can decrease
screwdriver slippage by cleaning the blade and tip and then roughening the
blade with some 80-grit sandpaper. Before driving each screw, rub the blade
tip through violin rosin or chalk, both of which reduce slipping.;    To
prevent damage to surrounding surfaces if the screwdriver does slip, drill a
hole slightly larger than the head of the screw through a scrap piece of vinyl
flooring. Place the flooring over a screw hole, insert the screw and begin
twisting. If the screwdriver slips the tip will mar the scrap flooring and not
the wood surface.; Q You once mentioned a cleaner for sink stains that mixed
something with cream of tartar. I used it. It worked. I lost the recipe and
now I'm in need again. What was it?; A Add just enough hydrogen peroxide
(available from a pharmacy) with cream of tartar (available wherever spices
are sold) to make a thick paste. Apply the paste to the stain with a brush and
scrub. Allow the mixture to dry and then rinse away. Repeat if necessary.; Q I
read that galvanized gutters will last longer if you prime the bowl with a
rust-retarding paint and then top coat that with exterior latex paint. How do
you paint the inside of the downspouts?; A Tie a weight onto a string that is
a couple of feet longer than the height of the downspout and drop the weight
down the downspout. Then tie the end of the string to a large sponge. Dip the
sponge in paint and pull it slowly up through the downspout. If the sponge is
too large you will squeeze out too much paint with the first tug. If the
sponge is too small you won't coat all the interior surfaces, so you'll need
to experiment to find the best sponge size.  </TEXT>
