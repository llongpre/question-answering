<LEADPARA>  VENEER is a thin layer of decorative wood glued over a core of less attractive
wood, plywood or a manufactured wood paneling like particle board.;    It is
common on furniture of all grades and periods. But it is fragile, and minor
damage can quickly become worse if not repaired promptly. Veneer on everyday
furniture can usually be repaired at home. Fine veneered furniture,
particularly antiques, should be taken to a professional restorer.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Cracks in veneer, which are usually caused by shrinkage, can be filled
easily by rubbing them with a colored putty stick.;    Lifted areas are also
relatively simple to repair. If the furniture was built before World War II,
the veneer is probably bonded to the core with animal-hide glue.;    This
softens easily when dampened or exposed to heat, sometimes causing the damage.
Mending can sometimes be done by applying moisture and heat with a clothes
iron as described below.;    Before attempting the repair, test the
composition of the finish by rubbing a cotton swab dipped in denatured alcohol
over a small, obscure area of the veneered surface.;    If the alcohol
dissolves the finish or makes it cloudy, the finish is probably shellac, which
will be damaged by moisture or heat. Therefore, it will be necessary to
refinish the piece after the repair is made.;    Practice clamping the damaged
veneer against the core so you can do this quickly during the repair. A
repaired area near the edges of a piece can be sandwiched between blocks of
scrap wood wrapped in aluminum foil or plastic wrap to prevent glue from
sticking to them. Use C clamps to tighten the blocks.;    Hard-to-reach areas;
 For an area that cannot be reached with clamps, like the middle of a table
top, weight it with several large books or bricks placed on foil or plastic
wrap. (At least 20 pounds of weight is normally required.);    To perform the
repair, lay a damp cloth towel over the area and heat it with an iron set on
low. Check the veneer often to avoid scorching it.;    When the glue beneath
the veneer softens, usually in about one minute, remove the iron and towel.
Immediately press the area flat with a rolling pin, then apply pressure with
the clamps or weight. Do not disturb the spot for 12 hours while the glue is
drying.;    Newer furniture contains glue that usually cannot be softened and
rehardened. To flatten lifted veneer on such furniture, first scrape away as
much old glue as possible, using the tip of a penknife, fingernail file or
paper clip. Blow the dust away, if necessary by flattening one end of a
drinking straw and inserting it between the lifted veneer and the core.;   
When scraping, be careful not to raise the loose veneer too high, or it may
break.;    If the veneer is brittle, place a damp cloth over the problem area
and apply heat with an iron as described. This will make the veneer flexible
and easier to work with.;    Reglue the veneer by spreading white or yellow
woodworking glue or liquid hide glue into the crack with a toothpick, an
artist's palette knife or a syringe made for the purpose.;    Press the veneer
down and release it several times to spread the glue; then flatten it with a
rolling pin, wiping away any excess glue with a damp cloth. Clamp or weight
the repair as described.;    Bubbles in veneer must first be slit open across
the middle. Use a new razor blade or hobby knife, and cut along the wood grain
to camouflage the incision.;    Do not try to scrape out deteriorated glue;
doing so can mar the edges of the slit, making an invisible repair
impossible.;    Instead, simply apply fresh glue. Press one side of the
blister flat while using any of the applicators mentioned to force glue
beneath the raised side, then repeat the process with the remaining side.;   
Press and release both sides several times to spread the glue. Then flatten
the repair with a rolling pin, wipe away any excess glue and apply clamps or
weight.;    When to use patch;  Chipped or missing veneer requires patching.
First, obtain a piece of replacement veneer from a woodwork supply store and
carefully stain it to match the damaged surface. With a straightedge and a
hobby or utility knife that has a new blade, cut a diamond-shaped patch from
the replacement veneer large enough to fit over the defect. The patch's long
dimension should parallel the direction of the wood grain.;    Next, place the
patch over the defect and orient it so its grain direction matches that of the
surface underneath. With a knife point, trace the outline of the patch onto
the surface.;    Remove the patch and use a sharp woodworking chisel to cut
through the damaged veneer, following the traced outline precisely. When
finished, gently pry up the wood within the outline and scrape away the dried
glue.;    The patch should fit exactly, or else be a little too large. If
necessary, trim it by using the straightedge and a fresh knife blade, or by
rubbing it against fine-grit sandpaper laid flat on a hard work surface.;   
When the patch fits, apply glue to the cavity where it is to go, then press
the patch into place immediately, before the wood swells. Flatten the patch
with a rolling pin, wipe away excess glue and add clamps or weights over foil
or plastic wrap. Refinishing should hide the repair almost completely.  </TEXT>
