The encaustic rose paintings of Sabina Ott exude a heavy, melancholic air. 
Their thick, waxy surfaces equate easily to time and seem to embalm each 
painting in dark musings about presence, absence or life and death. Ott's roses 
are the stuff of memories and old Victorian cards, swollen and fully open. One 
rose is much like another, a fact Ott uses masterfully in "Disappearance and 
Return No. 19," where she weaves a claustrophobic white web of pattern across 
the huge painting's surface. Part bridal gown, part flocked wall paper, the 
massed roses vie for breathing room seeming to drown and surface repeatedly 
amid milky flotsam. In other paintings the flower's obliteration is more 
heavy-handed as the artist washes over portions of imagery with runny veils of 
colored encaustic. In a corner of a four-panel painting a single small red rose 
evokes a vivid sense of violence. The impact is chilling.

Creighton Michael's driftwood wall sculptures read like Modernist tribal art. 
The elegance of his simplified forms recall Louise Bourgeois' sculptures of the 
late '40s but Michael's abstraction is more animalistic than figurative. Pieces 
suggest fetishistic shields, or abstract animal totems which are delightfully 
spry yet surprisingly earnest in their dignity. Perhaps it is the cocky 
spontaneity of sanded limbs covered with penciled lines gesturing broadly in 
refined courtship rituals that lifts this art out of the reverential doldrums 
that affects most fetishistic work. The nobility is there but thankfully it's 
got a sense of humor.

Perfectly Crafted Plywood: Erik Levine's three huge plywood forms are tidy 
pieces of self-containment. They look exactly like what they are, pieces of raw 
plywood perfectly crafted into rounded, vaguely mechanical forms of precise 
geometry and resolute functionlessness. Just looking at the unfinished surface 
dotted with staples, divided by pencil lines and liberally dusted with finely 
sanded wood putty, we know they have everything to do with construction. They 
bring out the craftsman in all of us. You want to run your hands over the 
surface because that's how you will really know the perfection of the shape and 
its fine smoothness. 
</P>
<P>
If this is Minimalism's "what you see is all you get" basics, then Levine's 
sculptures have found a constructivist trap door to allow for allusions to 
machines and containers of empty space. These Gargantuan models for orange 
squeezers, tops or drain plugs reek of industrial ramifications but refuse to 
get specific. Instead they bring up formal considerations about sculptural 
weight, interior vs. exterior volumes and implied movement retained by static 
form. Isn't it fun when something that looks that good before it gets 
"finished" can still carry on an intelligent conversation?

Occidental Exhibits: Of the four exhibitions going on simultaneously around the 
Occidental College campus, the most noteworthy is Michael McMillen's 
installation "Atlas Worked." Not as much a full-scale environment as earlier 
pieces such as his "The Pavilion of Rain," "Atlas" has more in common with the 
running musings of "Train of Thought" seen earlier this year.

United simply by the question "What Shaped Burbank?," the small gallery space 
is broken up by three sculptural "points" and a single painting. Most 
intriguing is a rusted, padlocked locker which has a bubbling fountain flowing 
loudly inside. The sound of liquid splashes coming from the sealed locker 
animate and inform the rest of the room with a hidden presence of life. This is 
in sharp contrast to the entropy projected by the rest of the works: a slowly 
rusting conical mountain of steel junk and a dirt-encrusted old drill press 
(the Atlas trade name of the title). On the wall is a painting titled "A Home 
in America" that focuses on a junk-laden backyard which backs up to a 
construction site where huge grubs are busy moving earth. 
</P>
<P>
Though it's quite spare, there is much to be said for the intelligence of this 
piece and the way McMillen allows the viewer to come to interpretations based 
on changing physical interaction with the sculpture. It's an experiential 
premise that's at the heart of some of the most interesting installation work 
being done today by artists like Ann Hamilton and Connie Zehr. In a sense, the 
art really only finds meaning through the observer. It's an interesting way for 
an object maker like McMillen to get the audience involved in the process of 
making the art.

In the next gallery, two painters take off on their own ideas of water in 
"Waterfall as Image." For such a hackneyed subject, both artists offer some 
nicely arresting abstract landscapes bordering on the figurative. Jean 
Towgood's writhing, Expressionist "Fire Falls" are the raw force of nature with 
an apocalyptic edge. Her energetic mark on naked canvas and inflamed color are 
the exact opposite of Gillian Theobald's icy cold rivers of self-illuminating 
swiftness which flow in bleached white blues against solid black rocks. The 
polarities form a refreshing juxtaposition.

Painter Jesus Perez makes points with his great sense of humor about death and 
pollution in "Dead Issues." Any artist who admits doing research for a Day of 
the Dead show by investigating folk tradition and then going to the butcher 
shop is in touch with an appealing sense of the absurd. While his paintings try 
too hard to be symbolic high art, the drawings are wonderfully inventive and 
playful. They are firmly entrenched in the Mexican idea that death and life 
have everything in common and are a delightful celebration of that unity. This 
is not gallows humor but something more lively.

On view in a different building are the somber, shifting-space interiors of 
painter Linda Kallan and the oddly diminutive sculptures of Pamela Burgess. The 
space is problematic for the work of both artists but Burgess suffers most with 
stone and metal pieces that have great difficulty with their scale.

Shegelman's Transformation: Russian painter Simon Shegelman's images have 
undergone a startling transformation since he left the Soviet Union in 1975. 
The linocut and silk-screen prints he made in Latvia, before his immigration to 
France and America, were dark, powerfully claustrophobic figurative works 
dealing with the emotional pain of regimented oppression. Little wonder that 
officials would close the exhibit for "political and ideological reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Since Shegelman immigrated, his work has exploded in a maelstrom of brightly 
fashionable colors. He is attracted to the flash and dazzle of the nightclubs 
and glittery trappings of "the good life." His paintings are a strange 
combination of Chagall and kitschy Leroy Nieman illustration montage. It's 
distressing to think that Shegelman could sound the depths of one political 
reality so clearly in his early silk-screens yet be so completely bedazzled by 
the materialism of another. But perhaps both systems are extremes and that's 
the simplification the artist is communicating.
