When six former Miss Americas joined Debbye Turner, Miss America 1990, at the 
May Co. this past Tuesday for a "Made in U.S.A." fashion show and to announce a 
May Co. $10,000 scholarship program for young women, the talk naturally turned 
to the beauty secrets of the tiara wearers. Jean Bartel, Miss America 1943, 
said she relies on lanolin for her skin. "You can buy it in a big jar at 
Rexall, and it only costs about eight bucks." Mary Ann Mobley (1959) sees 
surgery in her future: "One day I'll go to the plastic surgeon and tell him to 
start at my feet and work his way up." As for 24-year-old Turner, a veterinary 
student from Missouri, she confessed she never wears makeup at school and hangs 
out in her blue jeans, sweat shirt and "Sylvester putty tat" slippers.

LAMBADA FIX: Tonight the new Cannon Pictures film "Lambada" opens. And if there 
is anyone out there who thinks she simply cannot live another second without 
one of those short and sassy twirly skirts and sexy little tops, then remember 
this number: (212) 879-4810. It's the direct hot line to the Gilda Marx 
boutique, home of the Lambada dresses made for the movie. Marx is taking custom 
orders for the separates that retail for $30-$50 from dancers desperate to show 
their stuff.

NECK TIED: The newest neckwear is a gift wrap. East Coast teens have been seen 
wearing necklaces made from the package ribbon from designer boutiques. Their 
favorites are Hermes, Chanel, Benetton and Christian Dior. In New York City the 
girls have taken to asking for the ribbon gratis, but Listen learned that it is 
in such short supply at the Chanel boutique in Beverly Hills that the store 
can't spare any for customers who don't make purchases. The situation is 
equally desperate at Fred Hayman Beverly Hills, where the store has been 
besieged with requests for ribbon, says Valerie Seres, manager of the women's 
department.
