<LEADPARA>  Q We have a scratch in a green wood table. I can't find a putty stick to match
the green color and I don't want to refinish the entire table. Any
suggestions?;    A Buy a set of crayons. If the exact color you need isn't in
the set, heat and blend crayons to mix a matching color.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     With the mixture warm, fill the scratch and then shave off any excess with
a piece of flexible plastic, such as a credit card. Finish by using a paste
wax on the entire table.;    If you're not concerned with filling the scratch,
art supply stores have felt pens in a wide variety of colors that are
excellent for touch-up. When buying a felt pen, keep in mind that the color
will be about 50 percent darker when applied to raw wood, so buy a lighter
color pen than the color of the area surrounding the scratch.;    Q My kitchen
light fixture is framed in oak. I recently washed the walls and ceiling with a
TSP (tri-sodium phosphate) substitute that removed some of the finish from the
oak. What do I do now to restore it?;    A I think the easiest solution will
be to mask off the area of the ceiling surrounding the frame and then apply
two coats of a good quality paste wood wax to the frame. This should even out
the appearance.;    Ideally the fixture should be taken down from the ceiling,
the old finish removed from the oak and then refinished with polyurethane.;   
Q When I reglue wood joints that have been glued before with carpenter's wood
glue, the glue won't hold. What am I doing wrong?;    A You are probably not
getting the old glue off the joints. Carpenter's glues (aliphatic resin) need
to be absorbed into wood pores. The wood in a previously glued surface is
sealed and therefore you can't get a good bond.;    Remove as much of the old
glue as possible, then use an X-Acto knife or awl to scratch tiny grooves in
the gluing surface deep enough to where you see raw wood. Coat both surfaces
with the carpenter's glue, clamp firmly but not so tight that you squeeze out
all the glue, and let it set for 30 minutes. Remove the clamps and don't
handle the article.;    Q You mentioned a caulk that is used to fill holes in
walls and also stops fire from spreading through those holes. My hardware
store doesn't know what I'm talking about. Could you help?;    A The two
brands that I mentioned, Fire Barrier, manufactured by the Electrical Products
division of 3M, St. Paul, Minn. and Flame-safe, made by Thomas and Betts Corp.
of Raritan, N.J. are generally not available from hardware stores but instead
from companies that distribute electrical materials.;    Q A previous owner of
our house hung everything on the walls with Molley bolts. There are many
locations where we'd like to either remove them or fill them in. What's the
best solution?;    A Tighten the screw on the Molley bolt, also known as a
hollow wall anchor, until the face of the sleeve that receives the bolt dents
the face of the wall about three-thirty-seconds of an inch.;    Unscrew the
bolt and fill the threaded hole with steel wool. Coat the face of the sleeve
and the steel wool plug with white glue, so that you won't get a rust stain
from the steel wool and let dry. Spackle the depression and repaint.;    Q I
don't want to go to all the trouble of cutting a hole in my roof for venting a
bathroom fan. Can't I simply vent it into the attic space and let the existing
attic vents do the job.;    A No. The idea of a ventilation fan in a bathroom
is to move air and some moisture outside the house. Venting it into an attic
space could cause moisture related problems in the attic, not to mention that
your idea doesn't conform to building codes.  </TEXT>
