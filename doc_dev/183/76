<TEXT>  A It's not quite that simple. You need to have the project analyzed by an
architect or qualified building designer.;    I think the money you spend for
an on-site consultation will help you better understand the building
requirements and the costs involved.; Q Do you have any ideas on removing the
base of a broken light bulb from inside a socket? The base is in there solid.;
A Turn off the power to the fixture. The safest way to remove broken bulb
bases is to insert a Styrofoam ball into the base and twist counterclockwise.
The ball pushes down around glass fragments and metal and protects you from
possible cuts.;    If that doesn't work, wear protective eye goggles and
gloves and clean out as much of the glass as possible from the base. Find a 3-
or 4-inch length of wood dowel that will fit inside the base and glue it in
the base with two-part epoxy. When the epoxy is completely cured the dowel
gives you something to grasp with pliers to slowly unscrew the bulb base.;   
To prevent this problem in the future, make sure that the electrical contact
inside the socket is elevated to a height of approximately 3/16-inches and
lightly lubricate the threads of the socket with a very thin layer of
petroleum jelly.; Q A wall in my bathroom isn't flat or smooth, and that's the
wall that a mirror-front medicine cabinet is mounted in. How can I plug up the
cold air that leaks into the room around the cabinet?; A Buy some heavy
plastic (some hardware stores sell it by the foot). Remove the medicine
cabinet from the wall opening. Fit the plastic loosely into the opening so
that there will be plenty of room for the cabinet when it is remounted.;    If
the wall is covered with gypsum board, staple, tape (using double-sided tape)
or glue the plastic "pouch" to the wallboard, making sure that the staples,
tape or glue will be covered by the outside edges of the cabinet. Trim the
plastic so that it is also hidden by the cabinet. If the wall is plaster, use
the same plastic but don't use staples; instead use either the tape or glue.; 
  Another alternative, if the cabinet has trim with a cavity on the backside
where you could hide insulation, is to adhere foam insulation thicker than the
trim into the trim cavity.;    When the cabinet is pushed flush against the
wall, the foam should compress and make an airtight seal.; Q I once read in
the Home section how to remove oil stains from concrete. Can you repeat that?;
A Gene Austin gets credit for answering that question. Here is what he said:; 
  "There are commercial driveway cleaners available, but I've had good success
by making a thick paste from one-part Tide detergent and one-part TSP
(tri-sodium phosphate) and hot water. First, wipe away any substance that
hasn't been absorbed into the concrete. Apply the cleaner with a stiff bristle
brush to the stain, working it into the pores of the concrete. Then apply a
layer of the paste over the stain. Keep this layer of paste moist for a couple
of days by spraying it lightly with water, when it dries out. With a wide
blade putty knife, scrape up the paste and dispose of the sludge. Rinse the
spot with water. It's important that you protect the area being cleaned from
anyone walking by. As you can imagine, the spot is quite slippery."; Getting
rid of solvents; A free pamphlet, "Environmentally Considerate Disposal Guide
for Paint, Solvents &amp; Related Products," has been published by Klean-Strip, a
manufacturer of paint removers, strippers and refinishers.;    If your local
hardware store or home center doesn't have copies, you may request one by
writing to Klean-Strip, Box 1879, Memphis, Tenn. 38101. Keep in mind that
guides of this type give general information, which may not reflect local
regulations. Before disposing of hazardous waste, check with your city or
county hazardous waste or recycling department.  </TEXT>
