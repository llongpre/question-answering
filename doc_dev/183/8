<LEADPARA>  ONE of the challenges of living in older houses is opening windows that have
gotten stuck. But wooden double-hung windows sometimes stick tight or bind if
left closed for long periods of time. Here's what to do about them.;    Before
struggling with a stuck window, be sure that it is unlocked and that there are
no hidden fasteners such as security bolts preventing the sashes from moving.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     If these are not the problem, check for paint binding the sashes to the
frame. To free sashes that have been painted shut, score the seams of the
window along the tracks and the top and bottom of the frame.;    Use either a
utility knife or a tool called a paint zipper, which has a serrated blade. If
the exterior of the window has been painted recently, score the seams from the
outside if possible.;    After scoring, hold a wood block against the sashes
where they touch the seams. Hammer gently against it. Be careful not to break
the glass; wear safety goggles as a precaution.;    If hammering does not
work, force a corner of a stiff-bladed putty knife into the seam, then gently
hammer the end of the handle. While hammering, pivot the blade to embed the
entire edge about an inch deep. Then wiggle the knife back and forth to widen
the seam and break loose any paint inside.;    If the window still will not
budge, or if it binds while sliding in the tracks, get a block of wood about
1/16th of an inch thicker than the width of the window tracks.;    Hammer the
block into each track as close as possible to the stuck window; this will
widen the tracks by spreading their sides.;    Another way to free a lower
sash from the outside is to pry upward at the corners on the underside using a
wide pry bar. Protect the sill with a piece of thin plywood; protect the sash
with the blade of a putty knife placed between it and the pry bar.;    To free
an upper sash from the outside, you must pry away the molding strips, or
stops, at the sides and top.;    Use a stiff-bladed putty knife and a hammer,
and wear goggles. With the stops off, the window is held only at the sides by
the sash cords or other balance mechanisms and can fall out.;    If a window
sash binds but is not stuck, scraping and smoothing the exposed parts of the
tracks usually cures the problem.;    Use a small hook scraper or an old
chisel held with its beveled side against the surface to remove dirt and
accumulated paint from the corners as well as from the flat portions.;    If
the paint is thick, soften it with paint remover or a heat gun, then scrape
the paint with a narrow putty knife.;    Wear a filter-paper mask to avoid
breathing dust that may contain lead. Never use a torch to remove paint; its
heat can start a fire and also produce fumes. Collect paint chips in a bag and
put it in the trash.;    After removing the paint, sand the tracks smooth with
fine-grit sandpaper wrapped around a wood block. Wipe the tracks clean and
apply primer to any bare spots.;    After the primer dries, apply a thin coat
of finish paint. When it dries, lubricate the tracks with silicone or Teflon
spray or rub them with a candle.;    The sashes can be removed for repair or
for reconditioning the tracks. Start with the lower sash. Pry off one of the
stop molding strips on the indoor side of the frame using a stiff-bladed putty
knife and a hammer.;    The lower sash can then be pivoted out of the frame
while the bottom rests on the sill. Before removing it, detach the sash cords,
chains or balance mechanisms.;    When unfastening sash cords or chains, tie
each one to a screwdriver or long nail before letting go. Otherwise, the
counterweight on the other end will drop, carrying the cord or chain into the
wall, where it will be difficult to retrieve.;    Balance mechanisms can be
unscrewed from the sashes; this may have to be done before the sash can be
pivoted. Because the springs are under tension when the sash is down, grip
each one firmly as you free it, and allow it to retract gradually.;    To
remove an upper sash from indoors, you must first remove the lower sash. Then
remove one of the center molding strips, called parting stops, which divide
the sides of the frame into separate tracks. If the sash is stuck fully
raised, you will have to remove both parting stops and the head stop across
the top.;    Parting stops usually are inset in grooves. Score the paint along
the stop's edges, then grip the stop near the lower end with a pair of pliers
and pull perpendicular to the wall. With luck, the stop will come away. If it
breaks, replace it at a lumberyard.;    To reinstall the sashes, fit the upper
one into place. Reattach the sash cords, chains or balance mechanism.;    Then
reinstall the parting stop and head stop if removed, or the outer stops.
Finally, install the inner sash and its stop.;    When fastening stops, leave
a space about the thickness of a credit card between them and the sashes to
prevent binding.  </TEXT>
