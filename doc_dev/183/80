Dreaming in Color by Ruth Moose (August House: $15.95; 192 pages) 
</P>
<P>
It's very hard to write about people who are poorer and sadder and weirder than 
you without being condescending. Ruth Moose writes about her people with 
exasperation but real respect. 
</P>
<P>
The characters in the 19 stories that make up "Dreaming in Color" sport names 
such as Fronnie and Therma and Ladella and Thildalee. They live in somnolent 
Southern communities where any life of commerce or fun is fading fast: "The 
town is dead enough as it is," one lady thinks. "We don't need any more 
buildings to sit and watch run down. If it wasn't for the bank, drugstore, 
hardware, and Baptist Church, we could just close up shop. Strike Eddysville 
off the map -- if it's on any. I'm the only business still open on my side of 
the street and it's awful." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Moose's people tread that sad and narrow path between the hard-earned 
probity of the lower-middle classes -- bridge mints and broccoli casseroles, 
and tarnished family silver -- and the bleak wastes of hopeless White-Trashdom. 
Often the two classes share a single residential lot in town: The reputable 
families renting out a garage apartment to a poor and seedy "married" couple 
who aren't really married; who won't go to church or bring a covered dish to a 
picnic. The "wife," of course, will soon be abandoned. 
</P>

The Last Agent 
</P>
<P>
When money and stamina are gone, ritual, however empty, seems to be the last 
agent of momentum. Life in these stories is "going through the motions," no 
more, no less. 
</P>
<P>
The motions here include "beautification projects" for sad towns dead in the 
center, women's club meetings where the women's median age is somewhere in the 
80s, Thanksgiving dinner -- in the family tradition where the relatives you 
wish would stay home show up, year after year, and the ones you love manage to 
be absent, either in body or soul. In "Judas at the Table," a depressed wife 
makes an enormous meal, while her husband peers ominously out the window, 
hating every minute of it, and her daughter stands her up cold. "Sure," the 
wife thinks resentfully of her daughter blithely skiing in the North, "sure, 
the whole Thanksgiving thing is silly to you. Family is silly. Parents are 
silly. Parents who spend themselves silly to send you to that fancy school 
because you failed two others." 
</P>
<P>
When life is limited and essentially hateful, one's only defense is to pass 
that hatred on to someone else, to step on the hands of the people on the rung 
just below you climbing that social ladder. In "Cows, Coat hangers and the K 
mart Kid," the author takes a look at life in a raw new housing development -- 
the "Friendship" of two snippy young moms, Bettye and Sally, whose only bonds 
are their spanking-clean toddlers, and their common loathing for the trapped 
house that stands between them.

<P>
Their New Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
During the first part of this story, that jerry-built box is inhabited by a 
family with chronically ill children, a car that has a Kotex carton instead of 
a rear window, and a passel of sofas losing their stuffing out on the front 
lawn. Oh, disgusting! But when the "White-Trash" family moves out, a couple of 
conspicuous consumers move in. The wife wears diamond rings and a wet-bar 
appears as part of the permanent furniture. 
</P>
<P>
What's the proper response to all that? The truth is, the author reminds us, 
the whole point of being in a class system is that you're obligated to hate the 
people "above" you quite as much as the people "below." Movement in either 
direction is equally odious, and when a black couple (the only blacks in this 
whole Southern collection) moves into that same tract house, they blow the 
whole social construct sky high. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these stories are a little awkward, the collection is undeniably 
uneven, but the authorial voice is funny and strong. If you care about the 
South, if you cherish your creamed-onion recipe, if you still go through with 
family holidays not because you love them but because you should, you'll like 
this book a lot.
