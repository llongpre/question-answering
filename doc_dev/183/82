<LEADPARA>  A If oil has been freshly spilled onto a concrete surface, blot up as much as
you can, then cover the spot with one of the following: powdered calcium
carbonate, hydrated lime, talc or fuller's earth. Portland cement also can be
used. Let powder stand for 24 hours and then scrape it off.;    If oil has
penetrated into the concrete, scrape off whatever remains on the surface with
a putty knife and then cover the stain with a stiff poultice made from one of
the powdered substances above combined with a solution of 1 part trisodium
phosphate and 6 parts water. Let the poultice stand 24 hours, then scrape it
off. Scrub the surface with clean water.  </LEADPARA>

FROM A CONCRETE FLOOR?  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Grease is easier to remove than oil. If scraping and scrubbing doesn't
work, use a poultice made from benzene, naphtha or trichloroethane and an
inert powder. Allow it to stand 24 hours, then scrape the surface clean.;    Q
I want to buy a fire extinguisher for my home but I don't know which type to
get. What do you recommend?;    A The wrong type of fire extinguisher could do
more harm than good. It must suit the type of fire that's burning.;    There
are three types of fires. Class A fires are those that involve ordinary
combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth, rubber. These fires often start in
the living room or bedroom. Class B fires involve cooking oils, grease,
gasoline, paint thinners and other flammable liquids. These fires generally
break out in kitchens and garages. Class C fires are electrical fires and are
usually the result of faulty wiring, overloaded circuits or faulty electrical
appliances.;    On fire extinguishers, these categories are designated by the
letters A, B and C within a triangle, square and circle, respectively. Class
B-, or BC-rated extinguishers are not effective on Class A fires. Also, water,
which is effective in putting out a Class A fire will cause a Class B fire to
spread and can cause a severe shock in a Class C fire. Your best choice is a
fire extinguisher rated for all three classes of fire.;    When you buy one,
check to see that it displays the A, B and C designations. Also, note the
numbers in front of the A and B designations. These refer to the size of fire
that the extinguisher can generally handle. The numbers are not absolute
figures, but are relative terms for comparing different units. For example, an
extinguisher with a rating of 2A:40B:C will handle a Class A fire twice as
large, and a Class B fire four times as large, as a unit rated 1A:10B:C.;   
There are no size ratings for Class C fires. The C designation only means that
the chemical inside will not conduct electricity.  </TEXT>
