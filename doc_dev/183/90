   Tomato seeds exposed to the rigors of
space travel for six years seem to be germinating normally,
scientists say.
   The first small batch of seeds recently returned from a NASA
satellite were displayed Thursday _ apparently sprouting normally
in a germination test that began Saturday, said Dr. Jim Alston of
Park Seed Co.
   ``Everything looked fine. No little green critters came flying
out,'' joked Alston, whose company provided the 12.5 million seeds
for the experiment aboard the space agency's Long Duration Exposure
Facility.
   At a news conference called to display the germinating seeds,
officials also cracked open one of eight unopened canisters of
seeds launched into space in April 1984.
   The satellite was supposed to be picked up by space shuttle
astronauts and returned to Earth 10 months after it was launched,
but scheduling difficulties and the 1986 Challenger disaster
delayed its retrieval. They were retrieved in December by the
shuttle Columbia.
   The seeds _ most of them in sealed, insulated canisters _
appeared to have survived their long space journey, said officials
working on the project with NASA.
   In addition to the 12.5 million tomato seeds _ of the Rutgers
California Supreme variety _ there were 120 types of seeds
including corn, onion, cucumber and sunflower.
   Scientists will look for mutations caused by the heavy radiation
they were exposed to in space. Plants grown from the seeds will be
examined for differences in color _ indicating a loss of
chlorophyll _ and for differences in leaves, stems, flowers and
fruit.
   The results may be significant in determining whether food can
be grown in outer space.
   Opening the canister is something less than high-tech. After
undoing its 36 screws, Alston first tried to pop the top off with a
chunk of wood and a hammer, but he ended up prying it off with a
rusty butcher knife, a pocketknife and a putty knife.
   Some of the samples will be analyzed at the seed company, but
most will be shipped to colleges and elementary and high schools
across the country for experiments.
   The results of those experiments will be sent to Oklahoma State
University, which is scheduled to publish a report this fall on the
findings.
