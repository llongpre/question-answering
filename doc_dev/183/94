  [Text] [No dateline as received] Criticism by [Social 
Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf] Scharping regarding Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel's summons of French Ambassador Francois 
Scheer to the Foreign Ministry met with heated contradiction 
from the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. According to 
the Social Democratic Party [SDP] chairman, Kinkel must "take 
along some putty" when he goes to Paris soon. Kinkel permitted 
his behavior toward the French ambassador last week to be 
determined solely by domestic policy reasons, Scharping said. 
  FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer accused Scharping of the 
"foul creation of legends." The summons of the French envoy was 
"appropriate and necessary." It is dishonest that Scharping now 
tries to turn this into ammunition for the election campaign, 
Hoyer said.
