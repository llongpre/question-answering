   The stepped up security measures for U.S.
airliners around the world announced by the Federal Aviation
Administration on Thursday are directed primarily against one type
of bomb that has so far defied all detection methods _ plastic
explosives.
   The FAA announced it is requiring tightened security by U.S. air
carriers at 103 airports in the Middle East and Western Europe,
including X-ray or physical inspection of all checked baggage and
random physical checks of some carry-on baggage.
   Investigators sifting through the debris of Pan Am flight 103
which crashed last week in Scotland have determined that a powerful
plastic bomb blew up the giant Boeing 747, killing its 259 occupants
and 11 people on the ground.
   Attention has focused on one type of plastic explosive which has
been used in the past with frightening success by Arab terrorists _
an odorless, orange substance known as Semtex.
   ``It's a favorite with these groups because it's significantly
harder to detect than anything else, it's more powerful than other
plastics,'' said George Carver, a senior CIA analyst for many years
and now a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
   Czechoslovakia, a Communist country which has a well-developed
state-run arms and munitions industry, makes Semtex at a plant
called the Eastern Bohemian Works. U.S. State Department officials
say they have asked the Czechs to desist from production of Semtex
or at least to prevent its export.
   Recently, Czechoslovakia indicated it might be willing to stop
selling Semtex, said Neil Livingstone, who has served as a
consultant to government security and intelligence agencies and has
written seven books on international security and terrorism.
   Czechoslovakia is believed to have supplied Semtex to Syria and
Libya, said one State Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The United States also makes plastic explosives for use by the
military. But those substances, known as C-4, are not available to
commercial users such as dynamiting contractors.
   Like C-4, Semtex is malleable like putty and shows up on an X-ray
operator's screen as an indistinguishable dense mass. But unlike C-4
and other known plastic bombs, Semtex is completely odorless.
   Semtex also has the advantage of being stable, meaning it cannot
go off unless it is meant to.
   Conventional X-ray machines, as well as bomb sniffing dogs, have
so far been thwarted by Semtex and C-4. But researchers have come up
with what they say is a nearly foolproof response.
   The machine goes by the name of Thermal Neutron Analysis device,
or TNA, and is about twice the size of an airport X-ray machine.
During the yearlong test in the Los Angeles and San Francisco
airports under a contract from the FAA, it demonstrated a 95 percent
detection rate with few false alarms, the agency said.
   As part of the new security measures announced Thursday, the FAA
said it is accelerating by six months the delivery of more TNAs.
Under the accelerated program, the first unit will be in operation
next summer and the last of five, perhaps six, will be operational
by the beginning of 1990.
   The agency said it had not been decided where to place the
thermal neutron equipment, which could go into airports either in
the United States or overseas or a combination of the two. Each unit
costs $750,000 to $1 million.
   According to the FAA, the device is capable of scanning a piece
of luggage in six seconds and can be adapted for use with a conveyor
system that could handle large numbers of baggage in relatively
short periods of time with a low rate of false alarms.
   Lee Grodzins, an FAA consultant, said that until now, ``there was
no impetus. There was no public demand to put them into airports.''
   But the Pan Am disaster has provided the impetus to move the TNAs
from the experimental to the operational stage.
   The FAA _ with a nudge from Congress _ stepped up its development
of bomb detection devices after a terrorist bomb apparently caused
an Air-India jumbo jet to crash off the Irish coast in l985 and a
bomb detonated aboard a Trans World Airlines jet over the
Mediterranean in 1986, killing four Americans.
   The TWA bombing was determined to have been caused by Semtex and
carried out by a Palestinian faction known as the May 15
organization.
   Semtex also was the culprit in a foiled attempt sponsored by the
Syrian government to blow up an Israeli El Al airliner at London's
Heathrow airport in 1986.
