College Lab</HEAD>

   Junior high school girls played with
polymers, peered at a horse embryo and checked animal pulses in a
day-long laboratory visit that Hampshire College teachers hope will
persuade them to seek careers in science.
   ``We never did all this stuff in class,'' Tasha Galbreath, 13,
of Springfield said Tuesday in a break from comparing a rooster's
pulse with her own. ``My mother even wanted to come today, but I
told her she's not coming.''
   The annual ``Day in the Lab'' at the private college was started
four years ago by women faculty members concerned about statistics
showing fewer girls were choosing math and science courses.
   ``We wanted to show them science is something that women indeed
do and something exciting and personal, not separated from their
lives,'' said Merle Bruno, dean of natural sciences.
   This year's program was dedicated to Denice O'Neill, a pre-med
student who played an integral part in the event until her death
Dec. 22 in the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Scotland on her return
from a semester abroad.
   All three floors of the science building were decorated with
balloons and turned over to the girls, who jumped rope and ran on
treadmills to check their pulses, chewed gum to measure the rate at
which sugar dissolves, heard lectures on AIDS and saw a horse fetus
through an ultrasound machine at the nearby school farm.
   Bruno said the college expected 30 girls in the program's first
year but got 117. This year, the number of preregistrations climbed
over 200 as word spread about such seminars as ``Superballs and
Slime'' and ``Blood 'n Guts.''
   Several girls returned from previous years, bringing along
friends, sisters and parents. East Longmeadow science teacher
Richard Roz, who has participated three years, accompanied three
students from his eighth-grade class, his daughter and two friends
from her second-grade class.
   ``I've never worked with slime before,'' said Gina Potorski, one
of Roz' students, who mixed liquid polyvinyl alcohol and sodium
borate into a putty. ``It's cool.''
   She later mixed sodium silicate and ethyl alcohol to make a
high-bouncing polymer called a superball.
   The college sends notices about the program to public and
private schools in Hampden, Hampshire and Franklin counties. The
event falls during spring break for most junior highs.
   Bruno said the college geared the program to junior high girls
because they were at a crucial age in their education. ``Before
junior high, all students test out the same in levels of
performance, enthusiasm, aptitude,'' she said. ``In junior high,
differences appear between boys and girls.''
   One factor in the difference, she said, could be that girls are
subtly discouraged from studying math and science, a pattern the
program is intended to break.
