The Big O is not some nameless horror (oh, perhaps it is) but the pseudonym
of Roy Orbison, who made a career out of proving that life copied art.
Orbison sang melancholic ballads about loneliness and loss, and sang them
even more fervently when tragic accidents wiped out first his wife and then
two of his children. A career slump did not make him laugh much either.
But such traumas provide an ideal centrepiece for yet another rock-biog
musical. We start, naturally, at Orbison's funeral - he died of a heart
attack aged 52 - and are soon into one of those 'why, oh, why' scenarios,
with son Wesley asking Roy's best friend 'what sort of man was daddy?', and
hanging around 2 1/2 hours for the answer.
Actually Orbison was a very simple man. He had an amazing voice, described
once as sounding like 'the slow fall of tear drops', and minimal
personality. On stage he hid behind dark glasses - a wise move since he
looked like a Halloween pumpkin with the worst haircut in the world - and
never spoke to his audience. So naturally Bill Kenwright's much worked-over
production concentrates on the songs, all 40 of them.
The songs are great, from the inevitable 'Only the Lonely' to the unlikely
'Born to Run' (Springsteen was a great Orbison fan), and they are
enthusiastically performed by one of those bands of fine musicians who go to
pieces when asked to play cameo acting roles.
Still, it hardly matters with Larry Branson as Orbison. Branson is a
Canadian who has built a career as a Roy Orbison lookalike. The resemblance
is uncanny, and the voice is not bad either, fine for the low notes and the
vibrato, a bit rough in the upper reaches.
Of course just before his death Orbison had been re-discovered and was
working with Bob Dylan, a suitably tragic finale. Rock musicals always
follow identikit plots of mercenary managers, abandoned wives, marriage to
one night stands, and the inevitable circles of success, failure, success.
Only the Lonely is as good an example as any, and will please the middle
aged with fond memories and the young who like a good weep. Orbison was
always popular in the UK and, in his easy going way, he did not take umbrage
when on his first headliner tour he was given the Beatles as his supporting
group; he proved putty in the hands of Brian Epstein, who switched the
billing.
Such is the stuff of modern drama. Catherine Porter is suitably anguished as
wife Claudette, who inspired a big Orbison hit and whom he married twice.
Among the welter of quick impressions from the multi-parted cast, Anne Smith
was a notable Dusty Springfield. There is little insight, or subtlety, in
the show but it delivers nostalgia with an agreeable panache.
