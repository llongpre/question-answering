   Softer lines and longer clothes were two main points
in the new wave of outfits seen in summer ready-to-wear shows last
week. But the bonanza of choices made any ``war of the hemlines''
academic.
   Real-life clothes rather than gimmicky or strange costumes have
taken over as more designers aim to please practical women rather
than fashion groupies.
   Those who love short skirts can still rejoice, because there are
plenty of them, but the overly seductive look is fizzling and the
saucy miniskirt is seen only on the beach.
   The new silhouette is called A-line, trapeze or pyramid _ a shape
seemingly inspired by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid outside the Louvre.
To complete the pyramid form, shoulders had little or no padding.
   Full ``elephant-leg'' palazzo pants or pantskirts have taken the
city by storm. Started last season by Montana, Lacroix and Lagerfeld
at Chanel, they've caught on.
   Montana swept the stage with grand pantskirts, light as air in
soft, silky fabrics and shades of peach, bone and beige, with all
kinds of toppers. Some had floppy lapels, others came with a
sun-pleated flaring skirt effect in the back.
   Jumpsuits came back into the picture, often backless or strapped
with halter tops. Lacroix showed his in bright linen topped with a
bolero.
   Others showed the pants striped and sporty. At Chanel they came
out in white with belted gold-buttoned cardigan jackets.
   For hot weather, designers brought out wide and fairly long
shorts, some with suspenders. Little bloomers caught on as well, but
only for the younger crowd.
   Classic pants at Givenchy and Saint Laurent were splendid. Tight
pedal pushers or matador pants were another alternative, sometimes
with flared A-line toppers and tunics.
   Lagerfeld won kudos for his pleated long skirts, with cardigans
and jackets spruced up with stripes near the hem. For distinctive
at-home wear, he offered flowered coat dresses.
   Saint Laurent's best concession to the trapeze line was a fitted
white pique sun dress with a circular skirt.
   Most designers gave a nod to the short skirt, and those who
lopped off hemlines can still feel safe. Givenchy, Valentino, Saint
Laurent and others varied the straight skirt with tulip wrapped or
back-wrapped models.
   For understated chic, the jacket was very long at Yamamoto. Saint
Laurent showed faultless tailored suit models, Lacroix had several
boleros, and Bohan's jackets at Dior had his favorite little
martingale back belt.
   Fitted short or long jackets with a suggestion of a peplum over
lean dresses or suits added curves to ultra-feminine suits and
strapless cocktail dresses. Middy-blouse collars and swopped, curved
lapels gave suits and dresses a new look.
   The yachting life inspired most designers, who added sailor
outfits to their array of clothes.
   Safari-style clothes came with belted bush jackets and shorts,
wild animal spots on all softs of fabrics, dressed up in chiffon for
evening wear at Saint Laurent.
   Scherrer introduced an African-print swimsuit with an
off-shoulder wrap and matching chiffon tropical print jumpsuit.
   Angelo Tarlazzi did his Indian look with long silk tunics or
jackets with a sari-scarf wrap over skirts and pants. Valentino's
print mixes harked back to the layered looks of the 60s.
   While the strapless bustier is still around in evening wear,
puffy, overdecorated dresses have given away to sophisticated dinner
dresses and tea gowns or flowing pajamas with draped tops that look
back to the 1930s.
   Besides the ubiquitous navy, black and white, colors were at
opposite poles _ subtle and autumnal or flashy and bright. The
subdued shades included putty, sand, burnt orange, ruddy brown,
mossy greens, khaki and pea soup. For a softer touch in the fluid
clothes, designers worked with fabrics in smoky rose, peach, and
spice tones like mustard, saffron, cinnamon and cafe au lait.
   In the hotter scheme, optimists like Lacroix chose sunny yellow,
acid tones of lime and chartreuse, neon green, electric pink, flame
red, peacock and turquoise.
   For the new, wearable clothes, fabrics looked softer than ever,
from zephyr-light wools for daytime to organza, crepe de chine and
silk chiffon, lame and luxrex for evening.
   Linen is still a favorite, but it looks less rumpled this year.
Poplin, cotton voile cloque fabrics and pique were other summer
favorites, and lace was splashed about with abandon.
