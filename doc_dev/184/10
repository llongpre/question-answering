   East Germany will tear down a 600-foot
section of the Berlin Wall near the Brandenburg Gate and allow
completely unhindered passage between the two sides of the city
there, West German television said.
   Since November, the East Germans have created numerous passage
points through the Berlin Wall but have retained nominal checks of
passports or identity cards.
   The section at the Brandenburg Gate will be the first section
without any official controls.
   ``The Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate will be torn down,''
the ZDF television network said Friday. ``East German border troops
will start the work on Monday.''
   ``There will then be unhindered passage between East and West
from the Reichstag to the Brandenburg Gate. There will not be a
fence there as originally planned.''
   The wall, for years a symbol of the division of Europe, was
built in 1961 to prevent East German laborers from leaving. A
popular uprising in East Germany last fall toppled the hard-line
leadership and forced the opening of the wall in November.
