   A solitary building stands on the far corner of
the once teeming and elegant Potsdamer Platz, now a desolate no
man's land overlooking a jagged corner of the Berlin Wall.
   Potsdamer Platz will soon regain at least a semblance of its
former prominence after 28 years as a Cold War curiosity, East
German officials said Friday.
   Devastated during World War II and long a lonely tourist
attraction for a glimpse over the Berlin Wall, Potsdamer Platz will
shortly become another major transit checkpoint between East and
West Berlin.
   Its opening comes as part of East Berlin's decision to open its
borders to the West, officials say.
   Since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, Potsdamer Platz and
similar landmarks have been sober reminders of the brutal division
of the city and the two Germanys.
   For many Berliners, the blockaded Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer
Platz are the starkest symbols of that division. In both cases, two
main thoroughfares end abrubtly at the concrete base of the
imposing, graffiti-smeared Wall.
   When Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany
told a rally in West Berlin that the East Germans had decided to
punch a hole through the Wall at Potsdamer Platz, the crowd roared
with applause and cheers.
   Another famous crossing has also taken on new tasks.
   Berlin's Glienicke Bridge, a frequent site of East-West swaps of
spies and political prisoners, has since been opened to accommodate
more travelers.
   Another notorious stretch of the Wall is also to be opened _
Bernauer Strasse, where scenes of dramatic escape attempts stunned
the world 28 years ago.
   A house near the new checkpoint still stands with its
westward-facing windows boarded and sealed with bricks, testimony
to the first desperate attempts to jump to freedom as the Wall was
going up.
   Nearby, others died later in escape attempts that ended in a
hail of bullets. Eighty people died trying to cross the Wall.
   The Wall's most famous crossing, Checkpoint Charlie, will remain
in use for foreign visitors, although East German border guards
have allowed scores of East Berliners to use the crossing since
travel restrictions were lifted on Friday.
   No plans have surfaced so far to tear down the concrete barriers
that stand in front of the massive, 18th-century Brandenburg Gate,
which for decades has been a rallying point of protest against the
city's partition.
