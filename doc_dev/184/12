   The mayors of East and West Berlin shook hands
Sunday at a new Berlin Wall crossing point in a historic meeting
symbolizing the crumbling of the Cold War relic that divided the
city since 1961.
   Their meeting came after more than 1 million East Germans poured
into West Germany on Saturday, taking advantage of their
government's opening of Western borders. The vast majority intended
to make a brief visit and then return to the East.
   On Sunday, West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper and his East Berlin
counterpart, Erhard Krack, met at the Potsdamer Platz, a bleak,
virtual no-man's land bisected by the Berlin Wall.
   Hours before their morning session, East German workers drilled
a hole through the wall with jackhammers at Potsdamer Platz,
creating the third new border crossing point since East Germany's
Communist leaders announced the end of travel restrictions late
last week.
   Momper and Krack later left the area for breakfast and talks in
a West Berlin hotel.
   The new freedom to travel and other reforms in East Germany have
touched off a wave of enthusiam about the possibility of reuniting
the two German states divided at the end of World War II.
   However, East German Communist leader Egon Krenz on Saturday
dismissed such talk.
   The new wave of visitors to West Berlin and West Germany on
Sunday was expected to exceed Saturday's estimated 1.3 million
visitors, almost 8 percent of East German's 16.6 million population.
   Most of Saturday's exuberant visitors returned home overnight,
West German border police said.
   A core of East German and West Berlin revelers kept a joyful
vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the western side of the
Berlin Wall.
   However, West Berlin riot police vans lined up in front of the
wall at the Brandenburg Gate early Sunday to try to fend off
revelers who lit torches and candles in memory of East Germans
killed trying to escape over the wall.
   At the Friederichstrasse crossing point, known as Checkpoint
Charlie, renowned cellist Mstislav Rostropovich gave an impromptu
concert Saturday in front of a section of the wall covered with
graffiti.
   Police said a 24-year-old visitor from Potsdam, East Germany,
went into labor on bustling Wuerttembergische Strasse and gave
birth to a girl on the sidewalk, to the delight of a surrounding
crowd.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said he would meet with
Krenz, whose three weeks in office have brought a whirlwind of
change, to discuss ways of cooperating in the new age.
   However, Krenz told Kohl to forget any ideas of making the two
nations that rose from the rubble of World War II into a single
Germany again.
   East Germany's Communist authorities built the 14-foot-high
Berlin Wall beginning Aug. 13, 1961, to stem a flow of workers to
the West. Ironically, it was another flight this year, of more than
200,000 East Germans, that forced them to open it.
   East German leaders lifted travel regulations and pledged
greater democratic freedoms after both the exodus and weeks of
street protests.
