<P>
East German border workers began dismantling the Berlin Wall at the historic 
Brandenburg Gate on Thursday night to make a new crossing point between East 
and West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 10 p.m., a crane began lifting the cylindrical concrete sections 
from the top of the wall and a worker with a pneumatic drill started 
demolishing part of it. 
</P>
<P>
An East German border guard estimated that the work would only take about 90 
minutes as two teams of 10 border guard engineers cut openings to the left and 
right of the massive Brandenburg Gate. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow 
are due to inaugurate the new crossing with the mayors of East and West Berlin 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds cheered on the western side of the wall and some climbed trees to get a 
better view of the work. The scene was brightly lit by the floodlights that 
have illuminated the 12 columned-gate since it was walled off 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The crossing point -- two gates for one-way movement in each direction -- will 
be for pedestrians only.
