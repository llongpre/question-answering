<HEAD>Workers Begin Removing Famous Section of Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers on Saturday began tearing down the
thickest and perhaps most famous part of the Berlin Wall, a stretch
of graffiti-covered concrete in front of the historic Brandenburg
Gate.
   Crowds of tourists and souvenir peddlers watched as East German
soldiers and West German construction workers with heavy tools
began knocking away at the section ofwall that curves around the
18th-century gate.
   The huge, colonnaded gate represents the grandeur of old Berlin
just as the section of wall in front of it symbolized its division.
   The wall provided some of the most memorable images of the
revolution last autumn that ended four decades of Communist
oppression, opened the wall, and began the process of reunifying
the two Germanys. With the giant gate as a backdrop, protesters
with chisels climbed on the wall last year to demonstrate their new
freedom when East Germany's borders were finally opened.
   Much of the surrounding sections of the 100-mile wall already
have been removed, but the section in front of the gate is
considered the sturdiest. It is 10 feet high and equally as thick.
   The area around the Brandenburg Gate has become a heavily
visited tourist area. Makeshift souvenir stands hawk everything
from postcards depicting the revolt to key chains made of wall
fragments.
   The work Saturday was part of an ongoing process of removing
certain sections of the wall. The East German government says the
entire wall will eventually be removed, except for one section that
will stand as a monument.
   The East German news agency ADN reported Saturday that 70
segments of the Berlin Wall will be auctioned off on June 23 in the
principality of Monaco.
