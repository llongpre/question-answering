The Berlin Wall, which symbolized the schism between Eastern and Western Europe 
for 28 years, will be pulled down, an East German official said today in a 
dramatic demonstration of the liberalization of the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
East German head of state Manfred Gerlach told visiting Czechoslovak President 
Vaclav Havel that the wall will be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pulling down the wall. It has become superfluous. It will be replaced 
by normal border markings," Gerlach said in the interview with the West German 
daily, Bild. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach said that no date has been set for the wall's removal but that the East 
German government would discuss it soon. 
</P>
<P>
Bild said it interviewed him after he had taken Havel to see the wall and the 
historic Brandenburg Gate today. 
</P>
<P>
Havel told reporters that he was amazed that the wall, built in 1961 and a 
symbol of Germany's and Europe's division until East Germany opened its borders 
in November, is still standing. 
</P>
<P>
"Gerlach told me work would soon start to tear it down. I told him if he had 
any problems we could send some independent Czechoslovak workers to help free 
of charge," he said to loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
Havel also told journalists he would like to say "Ich bin ein Berliner" -- "I 
am a Berliner" -- as did President John F. Kennedy during his visit to Berlin 
in June, 1963, two years after the wall was built. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take the liberty to repeat this sentence at a new time and in 
a new context," Havel said. 
</P>
<P>
He said all walls and barriers in Europe must fall. 
</P>
<P>
Built by Soviet-backed East German troops Aug. 13, 1961, the wall was first 
breached last Nov. 9 as East German authorities were moving away from the 
Stalinist policies that had been their trademark for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Havel visited the East German capital briefly before seeing West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Munich, his first official visits since he was 
elected president Friday as part of an agreement among the Czechoslovak 
government, opposition groups and the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
His trips to the Germanys ahead of one to the Soviet Union reflected a shift in 
Czechoslovakia's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said his visits originally were to be symbolic but turned out to be 
"working visits." 
</P>
<P>
"We managed to discuss many concrete issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, Havel said he is opposed to the death penalty but he 
said last week's execution of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife 
may have saved many lives. 
</P>
<P>
After talks with Gerlach and Prime Minister Hans Modrow, Havel praised recent 
developments in East Germany, which has moved away from the Stalinist policies 
it had adhered to since its founding 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us Europeans must thank the GDR (East Germany) for having started 
pulling down one of the worst walls," said Havel, a playwright and essayist, 
who gained prominence during the spring 1968 uprising in Prague that was 
crushed by Warsaw Pact tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"This decade must become the decade of Europeans," said Kohl after meeting with 
Havel in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovakian leader also met with West German Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, President Richard von Weizsaecker and opposition leader 
Hans-Jochen Vogel. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who was jailed for five years for his opposition to the Communist 
authorities, was awarded the annual Peace Prize of the Frankfurt Book Fair last 
year. The Czechoslovakian government had prevented his traveling to West 
Germany to collect the award. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Havel declared a New Year's amnesty for common criminals and said his 
biggest task is to lead Czechoslovakia toward free elections without violence. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak Justice Minister Dagmar Buresova said in a radio address that the 
amnesty will be extensive because many prisoners are serving excessively harsh 
sentences. But she said corrupt public officials will be excluded from the 
amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many prisoners will be affected by the 
amnesty.
