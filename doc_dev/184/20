   A huge East German crane began dismantling a
long section of the Berlin Wall next to the Brandenburg Gate on
Monday night and thousands of people cheered.
   More than a mile of the wall is to be taken down between the
Reichstag building and the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point. Most
of it is to be replaced by a fence.
   ``This is terrific,'' said Ralf Lukas, an East German soldier
who operated the crane. ``It had to happen. I was terribly lucky to
be on the job.''
   A crowd of onlookers, estimated by one policeman at 7,000,
cheered as the crane began removing pieces from the top of the wall
and loading them into a truck to be hauled away.
   ``I'm so happy to see the wall come down,'' said Rita Wolter,
20, of East Berlin. ``It was a blight on our country.''
   Others stood on sections of the wall away from the crane,
watching the work under bright floodlights.
   Joachim Damme of West Berlin brought his little girl. ``This is
a historic event. I want to be part of it. I also want to show this
to my daughter.''
   East German officials said they will leave a 200-yard gap in the
wall between the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag, but nearby
fences on the eastern side would prevent unobstructed access to the
opening.
   Rainer Menzel, a spokesman for East German border troops, said
the entire wall between the gate and Checkpoint Charlie would be
down by the end of March.
   Since Nov. 9, the East Germans have been opening numerous
passages through the Berlin Wall, although the East Germans require
a check of passports or identity cards at all of them.
   The Reichstag is the expected seat of the Parliament of a united
Germany, although officials say it will take years to renovate the
ornate building.
