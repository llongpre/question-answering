   The building of the Berlin Wall began
with a few strands of barbed wire early one Sunday. Hours later,
the citizens of East Berlin became aware they were prisoners, and
they began the protests that rumbled for 28 years.
   On the morning of Aug. 13, 1961, I was awakened in my West
Berlin home and told to go to the border. The Warsaw Pact announced
the Communist regime of East Germany had been authorized to ``take
measures'' to stop the flood of its citizens to the West. I was to
find out what these measures were.
   I made for the Brandenburg Gate, the symbol of the city and the
site of a main crossing point between east and west, and saw
hundreds of men setting up a barbed-wire fence.
   Armed soldiers stood guard. Machine guns were posted in case the
people made a massive attempt to reach the West.
   As my car had British army license plates, I was able to pass
freely through the Brandenburg Gate into the eastern sector.
   From there, I saw that the barbed wire extended as far as I
could see in both directions.
   Squads of ``people's militia'' _ armed factory workers _ stood
by on side streets in case of popular opposition.
   A squadron of Soviet tanks was parked in the Frederichstrasse
train station.
   Hours later, radio and television announced that East Berliners
had been sealed off from the ``devious monopoly capitalists'' in
the West, who had been urging them to go West for a better life.
   I decided to swing through the city and return to the West
through the crossing point at Potsdamer Platz.
   Before World War II, this was the Times Square of Berlin, a
junction of five streets jammed with restaurants, theaters,
nightclubs and cabarets. Now, only the ghostly ruins of bombed
building remained.
   As I drove toward Potsdamer Platz, I noticed a platoon of East
German soldiers commanded by a young officer. I stopped the car
and, pretending ignorance, said: ``Good morning lieutenant, what is
going on?''
   As expected, he was well briefed and started a long explanation
of why it was necessary to cut off the West to ``prevent economic
sabotage by the capitalists.''
   Midway through his speech, he politely asked me to move my car
two or three yards forward.
   I had a good view through the rear-view mirror of soldiers
hauling a roll of barbed wire across the street. My car was the
last to pass over the Potsdamer Platz.
   In time, the wall there became one of the most solid sections.
It was there that Western authorities built a viewing platform used
by visiting dignitaries, including Americans presidents, to peer
into Communist-ruled territory.
   That afternoon and night, crowds gathered in West Berlin to
watch the barbed wire being erected. Some cried, knowing they were
now cut off from friends, relatives and loved ones in the east.
   Over the years, the wall grew into a potent symbol of Communist
oppression, a huge structure of concrete and steel, with
minefields, watch towers and guard dogs.
   At least 200 people were killed trying to escape across it, and
families wept in frustration because they could not visit one
another.
   This weekend, there were tears of joy as the wall started coming
down.
