   Germany today marked a year since the opening of
the Berlin Wall, a joyful anniversary interlocked with a bitter
one: the night in 1938 when breaking glass heralded the Holocaust,
war and German partition.
   Officials of newly united Germany also warmly welcomed Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, who arrived in Bonn today to a 27-man military honor
guard.
   The Soviet president's visit is highly symbolic since his
reforms helped collapse the Iron Curtain and open the Berlin Wall.
   He was to sign a 20-year German-Soviet non-aggression treaty and
was expected to receive financial aid for his nation's troubled
economy.
   Commemorations of the wall's opening were to include the
unveiling of a monument at one of the former crossing points
between East and West Berlin, and a ceremony to honor the more than
200 people killed trying to escape East Germany.
   At the same time, Germany's Jewish community held memorial
ceremonies on the 52nd anniversary of attacks on synagogues, Jewish
homes and businesses known as Kristallnacht - Crystal Night -
because of all the glass shattered by Nazi thugs.
   By the time World War II ended seven years later with Germany's
division, 6 million Jews had been killed, many rounded up in full
view of fellow Germans and transported to death camps.
   Heinz Galinski, a Jewish leader in Germany, said many Germans
``have never accepted Nov. 9 as a day of commemoration'' though it
led to the Holocaust.
   The mayors of West Berlin and East Berlin, Walter Momper and
Tino Schwierzina, said in a joint statement Thursday the two Nov. 9
anniversaries should remind Germans of the need to fight against
oppression of minorities.
   They called for the public to participate in national affairs as
``the best protection against against misuse of state power.''
   Jochen Feilcke, a member of parliament from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrats party, called ``completely erroneous''
statements from Communists that former East German officials played
a major role in opening the wall.
   ``Berliners streamed that night to the border crossings and took
over the wall at the Brandenburg Gate,'' he said.
   Last week, a report in the newspaper of the former Communist
Party, Neues Deutschland, said medium-level East German security
officers decided to let the pressing crowds through the wall,
fearing border guards would be killed otherwise.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the then ruling East German
Communist Politburo, also said last year the East German government
had intended to allow its citizens to travel abroad before the wall
opened. Portions of a news conference by Schabowski was planned to
be broadcast over loudspeakers late today in the central square in
East Berlin.
   The Bundesrat, the upper house of Parliament, was to mark the
wall anniversary by holding its first meeting in Berlin in 31
years, moving from Bonn, the federal capital.
   The two Germanys united Oct. 3 into a country of nearly 80
million people, by far the biggest in Europe. Their leaders pledged
repeatedly that the new Germany will not seek to dominate the
continent, nor would it forget the Nazi part of its history.
   Television news programs Thursday ran long recapitulations of
the celebrations that erupted at the Brandenburg Gate last Nov. 9
when it became known that East Germans were free to travel to the
West.
   One year ago, massive pro-democracy demonstrations and the
flight of refugees to the West prompted East Germany's Communist
leaders to begin opening the Berlin Wall. Hundreds of people
spontaneously climbed the 11{-foot wall that symbolized the
divisions of Germany and Europe.
   Shedding tears of happiness, some began using hammers and
chisels on the concrete barrier; soon a thriving business was
started selling chips of the wall as souvenirs.
   Bulldozers have finished removing 81 percent of the wall from
downtown Berlin, and have about two miles to go, officials say.
   Elections in East Germany early this year booted the Communists
from four decades of power, leading to last month's unification.
The first unified German parliamentary elections are Dec. 2.
   The sweeping change, however, has been painful for many former
East Germans as the switch to capitalism has caused inefficient
businesses to shut down, causing rising unemployment.
