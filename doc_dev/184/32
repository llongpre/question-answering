Czechoslovakia's new President Vaclav Havel, on a quick trip to the two 
Germanys, declared Tuesday that Europe need have no fear of a reunited Germany 
-- so long as it is democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who assumed the presidency last Friday, met with East German leaders in 
East Berlin and told reporters afterward that Germany "can be as large as it 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
He also made a surprise visit to the Berlin Wall, at the Brandenburg Gate, and 
said he was "amazed that the wall was still standing." According to Havel, the 
acting East German head of state, Manfred Gerlach, said that the wall soon will 
be coming down. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that if he had any problems we could send some independent 
Czechoslovak workers to help -- free of charge," Havel added. 
</P>
<P>
Gerlach also told the West German newspaper Bild that the wall will soon come 
down. "We are dismantling it," the newspaper quoted Gerlach as saying. "It has 
become superfluous. It will be replaced by ordinary border markers." 
</P>
<P>
Bild said Gerlach had not set a date for tearing down the wall, but had 
indicated that the matter will be taken up soon by his government. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said that the two Germanys should not decide on their future until after 
the euphoria brought on by their recently acquired freedom dies down, and he 
added that they should decide in consultation with the rest of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Democratic awareness and a democratic system," he said, "are more important 
than the possibility that it might become one nation of 60 or 80 million 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Havel, accompanied by Prime Minister Marian Calfa and Foreign Minister Jiri 
Deinstbier, spent four hours in East Berlin, talking with Prime Minister Hans 
Modrow and other officials, before flying to Munich and a meeting with West 
German President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he looks for good relations between Bonn and Prague and went on to 
say, "When I look at the weather here in Munich today -- bright sunshine -- it 
is a good omen for the 1990s that are now beginning." 
</P>
<P>
He said there would be no concrete agreements in his meeting with Havel and 
that "the most important thing today is getting to know one another." 
</P>
<P>
Havel, a popular hero of the November uprising that brought down 
Czechoslovakia's Communist leadership, said he expects East Germany and West 
Germany to agree on their future and that "it must be part of a whole European 
process." 
</P>
<P>
"It must be worked out by negotiations, not through wild gestures," he said. 
"Much of Czechoslovakia borders on East or West Germany; Germany virtually 
surrounds us. It must free its neighbors of fear, specifically the fear of a 
greater Germany."
