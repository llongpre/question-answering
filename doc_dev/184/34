   Americans, Italians and others clambered up the
Berlin Wall on Friday to join Germans from both sides of the divide
in an exuberant celebration of East Germany's newly opened borders.
   ``I've seen this wall many times, and I'm glad to see it break
open,'' said Rick Mike, an American soldier who joined the hundreds
atop the graffiti-covered concrete barrier at the city's hallmark
Brandenburg Gate.
   ``It should have happened a long time ago, this freedom _ that's
what we're here for,'' said Mike, who is based in West Berlin.
   Two jackbooted Soviet soldiers standing guard at the massive
Soviet World War II memorial less than 200 yards to the west of the
wall watched impassively.
   Champagne bottles littered the base of the wall. On the other
side, scores of unarmed East German soldiers _ some grim, others
bemused _ kept an eye on the throng on top of the barrier. A nearby
brass band drowned out shouts and the milling crowd paralyzed local
traffic on the wall's west side.
   The celebrations began late Thursday when Communist authorities
threw open East German borders for the first time since the Berlin
Wall rose in 1961. On Friday, authorities said they would forever
lift all travel restrictions and begin knocking down a portion of
the wall.
   Mike, 20, and another American soldier, Edward Tolentino, 23, of
Chicago, said neither they nor the city had slept since the first
wave of East Germans began pouring into West Berlin.
   ``I worked midnight shift last night, and I'm going to work
midnight shift tonight, and I don't think I'm going to get much
rest in between,'' said Mike, of Waltham, Mass.
   Robert Davidson, a modern dancer from Seattle, said friends had
told him of East Germany's decision to permit its citizens
unrestricted travel abroad, ``and I still don't believe it.''
   ``I was sure the wall was here to stay at least till the turn of
the century,'' but the decision to permit free travel for East
Germans had now changed his mind, he said.
   Sergio Lauria of Rome said he felt anticipation mixed with the
joy of celebrants atop and near the wall.
   ``People are waiting for something,'' he said. ``This thing is
not over yet.''
   His neighbor, Giorgio Puzzilli, said he felt fortunate to be
visiting Berlin at this historic time.
   ``This is a very important moment,'' he said. ``You have to feel
for these people, who have been waiting for such a long time.''
   Jozsef Dudas, of Miskolc, Hungary, said he felt special empathy
for the East Germans.
   ``If it weren't for Hungary, this wouldn't have happened,'' he
said, alluding to his country's initial role in the exodus of East
Germans wanting to settle in West Germany.
   Since Hungary threw open its western border to Austria Sept. 10
to East Germans wishing to turn their back on the East bloc, more
than 50,000 of them have used Hungary as a springboard to the West.
Others have used Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   At Checkpoint Charlie, three miles down the wall, officials lost
count of how many East Berliners had crossed into West Berlin since
the border was opened. ``It must be tens of thousands,'' said one
West German border official. Early morning reports in West Berlin
spoke of about 50,000 people.
   East Berlin construction workers still wearing their hard hats
drank beer and toasted their first experience in West Berlin,
watched by about 200 curious Westerners.
   There were jubilant scenes at other border crossings and East
and West Berliners joined in a never-ending party they had been
awaiting for decades.
   The wall, which has divided Berlin and symbolized the division
of East and West for decades, was built to stop the flow of East
Germans fleeing to the West _ 2.5 million from 1949 until Aug. 13,
1961.
   More than 20,000 Berliners gathered Friday outside the
Schoeneberg City Hall in West Berlin, where President John F.
Kennedy proclaimed ``Ich bin ein Berliner'' on June 26, 1963.
   ``There are some who say that Communism is the wave of the
future. Let them come to Berlin,'' Kennedy said. ``And there are
some who say in Europe and elsewhere, `We can work with the
Communists.' Let them come to Berlin.
   ``And there are even a few who say that it's true that Communism
is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Let
them come to Berlin.
   ``Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect.
But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to
prevent them from leaving us.''
   Every president since has repeated Kennedy's plea to tear the
wall down.
   Former West German Chanellor Willy Brandt, mayor of West Berlin
when the wall went up in 1961, said prospects for German unity had
taken a major step forward with East Germany's opening of its
borders.
   ``The Berlin Wall will come down, and Berlin will live,'' Brandt
said.
