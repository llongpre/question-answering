   Germany united with a burst of color under a clear
moonlit sky Wednesday to close out the most festive chapter of a
remarkable year.
   The two sides of Berlin were linked by a river of people that
stretched from Alexanderplatz, East Berlin's central square, to the
historic Branderburg Gate more than a half-mile away.
   Crowds estimated at more than 1 million swarmed down Unter den
Linden, East Berlin's main avenue, and spilled onto the broad plaza
at the base of the gate.
   Floodlights and fireworks lighted the sky as German unification
took effect at midnight to a stirring chorus of the national
anthem.
   Masses gathered from every vantage point to watch the center of
the celebration at the Reichstag, the old German Parliament
building near Brandenburg Gate.
   Germans draped themselves in the red, gold and black flag, threw
firecrackers and shimmied to the rock, swing, and jazz bands that
lined Unter den Linden.
   The gigantic party was heavily orchestrated - and commercially
sponsored - compared to the mass demonstrations that brought down
the Communist government last year and the jubilant euphoria that
followed the Nov. 9 opening of the Berlin Wall.
   ``This was overdone, all of this money,'' said East German
Hartmut Giese, 46, from a place where the Wall once stood in view
of the Brandenburg Gate celebration.
   ``But we need things like this to help bring us together, to
give us something to share,'' he said.
   On Unter den Linden, a West Berlin school teacher drew gawks as
she leaned on the railing overlooking the Spree River, smartly
dressed in black tights and a tailored Soviet major's jacket and
hat.
   ``I wanted to see what it felt like to be an occupying power in
East Germany,'' she said.
   Nearby, a huge crane suspended an East German-made Trabant, a
tiny, two-cylinder car that was one of the first products spurned
by East Germans when their borders opened to Western commerce.
   West German youths fired at it with flareguns, shredding the
now-obsolete East German flag that hanged below it.
   Leftist radicals held small rallies throughout the city to
protest unification. About 200 blew whistles outside a police
barrier at the Schauspielhaus, jeering arriving dignitaries.
