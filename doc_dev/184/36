<HEAD>News Teams Driven Away With Cattle Prods During Michael Jackson
Concert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>

   East German police drove away Western news teams
with cattle prods as they tried to film East German youths massing
to hear a Michael Jackson concert just across the Berlin Wall, the
journalists said today.
   About 4,000 East Germans gathered near the Brandenburg Gate on
Sunday night. They came to hear the American rock 'n' roll star
perform about 200 yards away for thousands of others at his concert
in West Berlin.
   West German television news teams were on the East Berlin side
of the wall and tried to film the crowd.
   But East German security police, waving electronic cattle prods,
drove them away from the scene, said the journalists.
   West Germany's diplomatic mission protested the incident to the
East German government.
   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was a
large contingent of communist plainclothes security men deployed
among the East German fans. They said a few arrests were made.
   On Friday, about 2,000 East Germans gathered near the
Brandenburg Gate to hear the British rock group Pink Floyd, which
performed in West Berlin on the first night of a three-night
``Berlin Rock Marathon.''
   East German security police arrested about 40 people during that
concert, witnesses said.
