   ``Ach, the stinking fumes from those terrible
one-lung wrecks! Who would have thought pollution was the smell of
freedom?''
   With that, cabbie Augustin Vogel left the wheel of his
Mercedes-Benz taxi and helped a laughing, cheering crowd of West
Berliners push another backfiring ``Trabbi,'' the East German
two-cylinder car, through the newly opened hole in the Berlin Wall
at Potsdamer Platz.
   Two blue-bereted French soldiers amused the crowd and shocked
the children peering out the streaky windows of the stalled car by
chipping away at the Wall with hammers and chisels.
   The big weekend shopping spree that saw 3 million East Germans
live the fantasies that tantalized them for years on western TV had
slowed from a torrent to a steady gush, but every daylight hour was
still rush hour on the streets of West Berlin.
   You had to wait in line to get into Woolworth's on Tauentzien
Strasse, but on the opposite side of Checkpoint Charlie sales girls
looked out the windows of empty boutiques with names like ``Lotus''
and ``Panda'' along Leipziger Strasse, East Berlin's fashion avenue.
   Shoppers hurried through the chilling fog with baby carriages,
shopping carts and rucksacks crammed with free world goodies.
   Even a sale on the eastern side _ ``stark reduziert'' _ of
snuggie wool damen slips, ladies' almost knee-length panties from
China, at 4 marks and Russian-made Strumpf Hose, at 14 marks,
failed to stem the exodus to the big mall over the Wall.
   A surpising consensus of sidewalk opinion along the
Kurfuerstendamm, West Berlin's Fifth Avenue, blamed the fog on the
fume-spewing Trabants and the slightly larger Wartburgs.
   ``Still it's a miracle to see all those DDR plates,'' enthused
refrigeration repairman Otto Esser, who played hookey from work to
spend his third day watching the flow of traffic through the Wall.
   ``This has been the happiest time of my life. I was two years
old when the Wall went up. I'm taking pictures for my infant son,
who hopefully won't even have the Wall, as a memory.''
   ``Oranges, bananas and coffee, that's what the Easties mainly
buy with the 100 marks handed out free to them by the banks,''
reported Helga Rosmunsen, a beautician who also called in sick to
spend another day watching the ceaseless flow of humanity along a
dust-beaten thoroughfare that only a week ago had been a death
strip.
   ``Even on a crowded downtown street you can tell an East from a
West Berliner by the happiness in their eyes. No wonder. Have you
ever tried to get real coffee over there?''
   Absenteeism was only a minor problem as another work week began
in East Berlin, but the weekend of wonders glowed brighter than the
few Christmas tree lights looming faintly in the fog.
   The Volkskammer, the Communist-dominated parliament, was
electing a new prime minister in the old town hall up by the
Brandenburg Gate, but at a Bierstube just a few blocks away
blue-collar beer drinkers switched off the government television
news to see if the Western channels were reporting any new holes in
the Schandmauer, the wall of shame.
   Meanwhile, on the other side of the Brandenburg Gate, now
sheared of its barbed wire curls, a procession of famous Western TV
anchors from several dozen countries waited their turn to do
stand-ups in the floodlit splendor of this landmark rubbled arch.
   Even at the Museum at Checkpoint Charlie _ with its bizarre
collection of motorbikes, battered buses, homemade submarines and
hot-air balloons that had confounded East Berlin's wall guards,
patrol dogs and mine fields _ NBC's Tom Brokaw and crew had to line
up for an interview with the curators.
   At the CSSR Kultur und Informationszentrum just a few hundred
yards to the east, there was no wait for interviews and no culture
customers either, despite a display of children's patriotic poster
art.
   ``The Easties will be back in even larger numbers this
weekend,'' predicted postcard vendor Axel Gruber at the Potsdamer
hole in the wall.
   ``This time it won't be for just shopping. They'll want to see
our famous zoo and the Rembrandts and the Head of Queen Nefertiti
in the Dahlem Museum. They know free Berlin has more to offer than
blue jeans and cassettes of the British rock group Exodus.''
