<HEAD>US Embassy Denies Party Newspaper Report on Mexican Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy in East Berlin has posted a
denial on its outside wall of a report in the Communist Party
newspaper that the U.S.-Mexican border resembles a battle zone.
   It also said people try to get into the United States, not out
of it, as in the case of East Germany.
   Embassy officials posted the printed denial Monday in a
glassed-covered case attached to the wall of the embassy about 300
yards from the Brandenburg Gate in East Berlin, where East Germans
can walk up and read it.
   The statement disputes a report in the party newspaper Neues
Deutschland that calls the U.S.-Mexican border a ``fighting zone.''
   Neues Deutschland said there is often shooting in the area, with
an ``average of 3,000 arrests per day,'' and U.S. border troops
guarding it were trained to ``shoot instinctively.''
   In its denial, the embassy says the border is a ``showplace and
symbol of a complex social and economic situation'' and ``every
U.S. citizen is free to leave the United States when they want to.''
   Apparently in reference to restricted zones along the Berlin
Wall and the heavily fortified East German border with West
Germany, the embassy statement says the border between the United
States and Mexico has no fortifications.
   ``It has never had mine fields, automatic shooting devices,
shoot-to-kill orders, moats or barriers of steel and cement, to
hinder vehicles from crossing,'' the statement says, and in
contrast to the situation in East Germany, ``people attempt to
enter our country.''
   In addition to the Berlin Wall and armed guards, East Germany
has steel-mesh fences and walls along its nearly 870-mile border
with West Germany to prevent escapes to the West.
   The East Germans for years also had mine fields and automatic
shooting devices along the border, but began dismantling them
several years ago.
   According to West German figures, 188 East Germans have died
trying to escape across the the border since the Berlin Wall was
built in August 1961.
