   East Berliners reacted with astonishment to the
announcement Thursday that their Communist government was allowing
them to travel freely to the West for the first time in decades.
   ``Is it really true?'' asked Mario Schmidt.
   ``Show me the ADN report,'' the 18-year-old demanded, seizing a
copy of the news as reported by East Germany's official news agency.
   ``Why don't they just tear the wall down right away?'' said
student Birgit Grosspetzsch, 18, referring to the Berlin Wall built
in 1961 by East Germany to keep its citizens from going West.
   Late Thursday, about 100 East Germans gathered at the
Brandenburg Gate, the huge monument just over the Berlin Wall in
East Berlin.
   ``Open the gate! Open the gate!'' they chanted.
   Two sisters whose last trip West was to the funeral of their
grandmother in West Berlin in 1966 were so happy that tears of joy
brimmed in their eyes.
   ``We're going to the friends in West Berlin as soon as we can,''
said the older sister, aged 56. ``Really great,'' added her
44-year-old sister.
   West German police said about 100 East Germans had already
crossed through Berlin Wall crossing points, while other East
Germans apparently waited for police offices that issue visas to
open in the morning. The government announcement came after the
offices closed.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the ruling Politburo, announced
that East Germany's heavily fortified frontier with West Germany
would be opened as a provisional step until a law is passed to
allow greater freedom of travel.
   The decision means all East Germans ``can travel over all East
German border checkpoints,'' including through the Berlin Wall,
Schabowski told reporters in East Berlin.
   Schabowski did not say when the law would be passed.
   Several young people thought the news would help to stem the
mass exodus to the West. More than 200,000 have fled for the West
so far this year, including 50,000 who have escaped through
Czechoslovakia since Saturday.
   ``I think that even some of those who left recently will come
back now,'' said a 25-year-old electrician who gave his name only
as Thomas.
   He had just heard the news from his mother, who made immediate
plans to visit his brother, one of the tens of thousands of people
who have fled West in recent weeks through Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
   ``I'll be off to visit my brother in Munich,'' he beamed. ``But
I'll come back. I think many people will think about that now,
where so much is changing here.''
   Another mother, Brigitte Hinze, made immediate plans to take
underwear to her 19-year-old son, who fled to West Berlin through
Prague last week. She was carrying the garments in a plastic bag,
ready to mail off, when she heard the news.
   ``Now I'm going to visit as soon as I can,'' she said, her voice
shaking. ``I'm so happy.''
   Uwe Landgraf, 28, made plans for a trip to Paris. ``Now I no
longer feel locked in here.''
   Sabine, a 22-year-old secretary, also named France as her first
destination.
   ``Now I can get to know countries that we only ever saw on maps
or heard about at school,'' she said.
   Several of those hearing the news at East Berlin's Schoenhauser
Allee metro station said they believed West Germans also would be
happy.
   ``They can't cope any more,'' Thomas said.
   West German officials have said their reception centers are
overflowing with the East Germans who have come West just since
their Communist government allowed them out through Czechoslovakia
last Friday.
   Although relaxing travel restrictions would satisfy one of the
central demands of dissatisfied East Germans, others remain.
Demonstrators have demanded free elections and the end of the
Communists 40-year monopoly on power.
   ``One party, that's a dictatorship, and nothing will change,''
said an 80-year-old widow. ``We need a multiparty government.''
   ``We've got to get the right people in there _ then we can start
talking,'' said Wolfgang Karek, 50, a newspaper vendor and
part-time musician.
   Communist leader Egon Krenz on Thursday urged a new law ensuring
free and democratic elections. But he did not say whether he was
urging a true multiparty system.
   Despite the jubilation over the prospect of free travel, East
Berliners remain skeptical of promised reforms, having heard too
many promises from the Communists before to believe in fundamental
change now.
   ``The changes are not yet really what we want,'' said a canteen
worker in his 50s. ``We need completely new people _ we've seen
where it led with the old lot.''
   ``You can forget him,'' a 70-year-old retired trade worker said
of Krenz. ``Just a puppet like all the rest of them. For the
moment, he's the only man possible, but he won't last.''
