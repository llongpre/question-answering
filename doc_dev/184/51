   Western buyers are paying nearly $30,000 for
large segments of the Berlin Wall, an East German newspaper said
Thursday.
   Helge Moebius, an official of the East German foreign trade
company Limex-Bau, told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper that the
2.7-ton segments of the wall are bringing between $11,800 and
$29,400 each.
   The newspaper did not say how many pieces have been sold so far.
   The cement wall sections, each about 10 feet high and six feet
wide, are being sold to collectors from the United States, Britain,
West Germany and other Western countries, the newspaper said.
   Asked why the pieces of wall were so expensive, Ms. Moebius said
that tearing down the wall and replacing it with a six-foot-high
metal fence costs about $47,000 per kilometer, or six-tenths of a
mile.
   East German border guards began tearing down a 325-yard section
of the graffiti-covered wall Monday night near West Berlin's
Kreuzberg district in the southeastern part of the city.
   Large segments of the wall earlier had been removed from
Brandenburg Gate and the Potsdamerplatz where new border crossings
have been opened.
   Profits from sale of the wall are to be used for humanitarian
purposes, Ms. Moebius was quoted as saying, such as improving
medical facilities and care of memorial sites in East Germany.
   The Berlin Wall, built in 1961 to prevent East Germans from
escaping to the West, was opened in November.
