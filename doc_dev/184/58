   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
criticized people who say there is little chance the two Germanys
will reunite, an apparent response to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
comments on the subject.
   ``He who does not want to make decisions for our people should
not try to persuade them the best thing is a division of our
fatherland,'' Kohl said in his first speech to Parliament on East
Germany's historic border openings.
   In East Germany, the leader of a political party long allied
with the ruling Communists but now asserting independence said the
Communists' control of the government will be challenged during a
Parliament session Friday.
   In another development, East Germany's Communist Party daily
Neues Deutschland announced today in a front-page report that its
longtime chief editor had been replaced. The report said the change
occurred after the staff of the orthodox publication engaged in ``a
confrontation with the past.''
   It said editor Herbert Naumann was replaced by Wolfgang
Spickermann to promote change at the newspaper, until now a forum
for harsh attacks on Western capitalism and even on the reforms of
Gorbachev, the Soviet president.
   Reunification has become an increasingly important topic
following the growing unrest in Communist East Germany that led to
the new government of President Egon Krenz and the decision to open
the nation's borders.
   Gorbachev on Wednesday said talk about reunification ``would
mean interference in the affairs'' of East Germany and West Germany.
   But Kohl, who did not mention Gorbachev, said East Germans
``must be able to decide for themselves, which path they want to
follow in the future.''
   Kohl said West Germany would ``respect every decision made by
the people of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in free
self-determination.''
   The chancellor claimed socialism is a ``total failure.'' A day
earlier, Gorbachev insisted the Communist revolution ``was not a
mistake.''
   Kohl pledged to NATO and European Economic Community allies that
West Germany remains committed to the integration in Western
Europe. Kohl also said ``solution of the German problem and the
overcoming of Europe's division are inseparably linked.''
   During today's debate in Parliament, former Chancellor Willy
Brandt said he doesn't have the impression East Germans want
reunification soon.
   ``Apparently they see the question of free elections as the
matter of priority,'' said the 75-year-old Social Democrat.
   British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, commenting on
reunification during a visit to West Berlin today, said it is not
realistic now. ``It is not actively on the agenda. ... It is not
what people in the GDR (East Germany) are pressing for,'' Hurd told
reporters at the city's Reichstag building.
   Krenz, who is also Communist Party chief, met with leaders of
allied political parties and the new parliamentary speaker,
Guenther Maleuda, to discuss the other parties' call for a better
power-sharing arrangement among the recognized political groups.
   The official ADN news agency, reporting on the meeting, said the
leadership wants a commission formed to draw all political and
popular movements into the reform process. Maleuda has called for
the creation of a multiparty government.
   Manfred Gerlach, head of East Germany's Liberal Democractic
Party, said his country's constitutional guarantee of a ``leading
role'' for the Communist Party would be challenged at Friday's
session of the increasingly independent-minded parliament.
   It was not known whether a vote on the change would come the
same day.
   ``I figure it will pass with a large majority,'' Gerlach said in
an interview with West Germany's ARD radio network.
   Gerlach predicted free elections as early as next year and that
the Communists would fail to win a majority.
   Hundreds of people, meanwhile, waited on both sides of the
Berlin Wall for a possible opening of a border crossing at the
Brandenburg Gate. The gate, Berlin's best-known landmark, has
symbolized the division of Germany since the Wall was built in
1961. East Berlin has opened 22 border crossings at the Wall since
lifting travel restrictions Thursday and there has been wide
speculation that an opening at the gate is next.
   In response to East German's move toward reforms, West German
Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann has offered massive aid similar
to the U.S. Marshall Plan that helped rebuild war-ravaged Western
Europe after the Nazi defeat.
   But the offer is conditional on fundamental changes in East
Germany's economic and political systems.
   East German officials have spurned the offer, saying they prefer
their own recovery course. They have made it clear that they are
not ready to abandon their centrally-planned economic system.
