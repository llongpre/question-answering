   A group of American congressman took chisels
and hammers in hand Saturday to chip away chunks of the Berlin Wall.
   ``We're all getting a piece of the wall,'' said Rep. Mike Espy,
D-Miss., part of a six-member congressional delegation visiting
Berlin.
   A small crowd of smiling but puzzled Germans and several
uniformed West Berlin police looked on, shaking their heads.
   ``You're looking for the U.S. group. Would you believe they're
over there breaking down the wall?'' one policeman told a reporter
helplessly.
   The delegation, led by Maryland Democrat Steny H. Hoyer, met
with East Germany's interim President Manfred Gerlach a day earlier.
   Other members of the delegation included Reps. Martin Frost,
D-Texas; E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla.; Lawrence Smith, D-Fla.; and
Benjamin Cardin, D-Md.
   On Saturday, they visited the West Berlin side of the wall at
Potsdamer Platz, just a few minutes' walk from Brandenburg Gate. A
couple of them chipped away pieces of the cement barrier for
souvenirs.
   As the chipping continued, with Espy energetically flailing at
the wall with hammer and chisel, spraying bits of cement all over
the place, Hoyer spoke about the group's earlier visit in East
Berlin.
   Turning around to look back to where Espy was banging away at
the wall, Hoyer said, ``The status of Berlin was not discussed by
us in any depth. But it will be much more open. The breaking of the
wall is a symbol of that.''
   During the talks, Gerlach told the delegation he thinks Soviet
troops based in East Germany could be withdrawn soon, Hoyer said.
   ``He didn't give a real timetable for the withdrawal, but did
mention in two to three years,'' Hoyer said.
   The Soviet Union has about 400,000 troups based in East Germany,
while the U.S. forces in West Germany number about 250,000.
   East German deputy Foreign Minister Ernst Krabatsch, who also
met with the delegation, said he expects the United States to
withdraw some of its forces.
   The talks only lightly touched on discussion of reunification of
the two German states, he said.
   ``We got the feeling that even the opposition (in East Germany)
is worried about how capitalism would be for the poor,'' Hoyer said.
   East Germany's social net is aimed at ensuring cradle-to-grave
security for its citizens, with everyone supposedly gainfully
employed.
   Hoyer said he sees no precedent for what the East Germans have
in mind for establishing a new political system, something between
communism and capitalism where ``there's no real model for them to
follow.''
   ``The East Germans are in a transitional period,'' he added.
``It will take time for them to master the situation.''
   ``Most of the people we talked to said the borders won't change,
and I'm talking about (East Germany's) border with Poland, but the
wall will go, only a few pieces will remain as a reminder,'' Hoyer
predicted.
