   Jovial West German boys spent the night firing
their flare guns at a little East German car suspended by a giant
crane.
   A woman leaned on a railing over the Spree River, dressed in a
smartly tailored Soviet major's uniform. She said she wanted to
feel like an occupying power.
   A man wearing a black ski mask sat in a lawn chair in the heart
of the celebrations over German unity, passing out leaflets
explaining why it should not take place.
   Too late. Germany became one nation today, but it was clear that
its inhabitants are still two people.
   For West Germans, the celebration was pure, a victory.
   But for East Germans, it was tinged with angst. Many are now out
of work - or will be soon - and must find a way to fit into a
foreign society.
   An estimated 1 million people gathered for the moment, at
midnight, and a nearly full moon, a brace of searchlights and a
seemingly endless supply of fireworks lighted up the clear night
sky.
   It was the most festive, and the most orchestrated, of the mass
street celebrations that have marked East Germany's transition from
a communist country to a free nation to part of a new Germany.
   A giant German flag was raised over the Reichstag, the old
parliament building near where the Berlin Wall once divided the
city.
   Masses of people surrounded the building in the chilly, clear
night and packed the nearby plaza of the gigantic Brandenburg Gate.
Many joined in an emotional chorus of the national anthem.
   Harmut Giese watched the scene from nearby Potsdamer Platz, the
once-bustling main square of old Berlin reduced to a muddy field by
the Berlin Wall.
   ``This was overdone, all of this money,'' said the 46-year-old
East German, a teacher at a machinists trade school.
   ``But we need things like this to help bring us together, to
give us something to share,'' he said. ``Even children in
kindergarten here think in terms of communism, closed borders.
Everything is still new.''
   Giese said his 19-year-old daughter was a dissident during the
old days and was relentlessly harassed by the Communist secret
police. He said she now lives in West Germany.
   ``It was hard for us,'' he said.
   Standing not too far away, with his wife and two children, was
Wolf Glaeser, an employee for the East German airline Interflug. He
said he's losing his job by year's end.
   ``I came for the fireworks,'' he said. ``Unity is so-so. There
are just too many economic problems for me.''
   East Berlin's main avenue, the broad Unter den Linden, was a
surging tide of shoulder-to-shoulder celebrants who flowed from one
side of downtown to the other.
   Swing, rock and jazz bands lined the promenade, restaurants
pushed bratwurst and beer, peddlers hawked unity T-shirts and
well-dressed people wore balloons on their heads.
   Heide Thielbeer of Hamburg stopped pedestrian traffic and drew
gawks.
   Miss Theilbeer tested East Germans' inherent animosity for their
Soviet occupiers by wearing a Soviet major's jacket and hat, and
black tights.
   ``I wanted to see what it would be like to be an occupying power
in East Germany, expecially now that the Soviets have to go away,''
she said.
   She would not give her age. ``But I was born during Stalingrad,
darling,'' she said, referring to the 1942-43 battle during which
the Soviets defeated the Nazi army. The battle is considered a
turning point in the war.
   Leftist radicals held scattered protests in both sides of
Berlin.
   About 200 brought shrill whistles to the Schauspielhaus, the
opera house in East Berlin where a ritzy pre-unity party was thrown
for top German politicians.
   They jeered at the arriving guests, blew their whistles and
chanted ``Germany, drop dead!''
   The surreal scene near Brandenburg, as bright as daylight under
the glare of floodlights, inexplicably included a giant crane
holding aloft a tiny Trabant, the two-cylinder auto that stopped
rolling off assembly lines as soon as East Germans were able to buy
Western cars.
   West German youths with flare guns spent their time firing at
it, and frequently hitting it. The obsolete East German flag
hanging below it was tattered by night's end.
   A 24-year-old East Berliner who refused to give his name sat in
a lawn chair in front of Brandenburg Gate, surrounded by thousands
of jubilant pro-unity celebrants.
   He passed out pamphlets while wearing a black ski mask. Unity
was too costly and unfair to Germans in both sides, it said.
   ``People here have been giving me trouble,'' he said.
