   Communist guards arrested two East Germans who
were running toward the Berlin Wall on Friday, the 35th anniversary
of the failed East German workers' uprising that was put down by
Soviet soldiers and tanks.
   The day is a national holiday in West Germany, with most
businesses and offices closed, but there are no East German
commemorations of the revolt.
   West Berlin police said eight communist border guards arrested
the two men as they tried to reach the heavily fortified wall that
divides the city.
   Witnesses said they heard the men shout ``Go on shoot, you
pigs!'' to the pursuing guards early Friday.
   On June 17, 1953, thousands of workers in East Berlin staged
strikes and demonstrations demanding free elections, the removal of
the communist government and better living conditions.
   Late Thursday night, about 2,000 East German youths gathered
near the wall to listen to a concert by British rock group Pink
Floyd being staged on the West Berlin side of the concrete barrier.
   Many shouted, ``The wall must go!''
   East German security forces were deployed througout the area
near the Brandenburg Gate and about 20 people were arrested, West
Berlin police said.
   After the concert, police said at least six firebombs were
hurled by West German youths at the wall as concert fans in West
Berlin dispersed.
   West German officials marked the June 17 uprising anniversary by
calling on the East German government to improve its human rights
performance.
