   East Germans began the New Year on Monday
with the task of cleaning streets littered by fireworks and broken
glass and repairing an economy sapped by four decades of Communist
mismanagement.
   The first year of the 1990s will see the first free elections in
East Germany's 40-year history, but it will also determine whether
it remains independent and sovereign or is merged with the wealthy
West German state.
   ``This is going to be a very full and important year,'' said
Baerbel Richter, who strolled through the debris-strewn streets of
East Berlin with her 5-year-old grandson, Franciskus. ``We have to
be careful how we go about it.''
   Freedom to travel has whetted some East Germans' appetites for
the more comfortable lifestyles taken for granted in the West,
while others have resolved to protect the separate statehood of
East Germany against what they see as an attempt by Bonn to buy
them out.
   Debts and declining productivity may worsen if an exodus to the
West continues to drain East Germany of its skilled workers and
hope for the future.
   At least 320,000 East Germans relocated to West Germany in 1989,
undermining the economy of the already labor-short socialist state
of more than 16 million people.
   Reforms likely to devalue East Germany's currency while boosting
the price of many basic food and consumer items are under
consideration as the interim government moves cautiously to
introduce market principles into the planned economy.
   In his New Year's message, Premier Hans Modrow appealed for
broader financial support from West Germany, but continued to
resist formal unification that could subjugate his nation to its
capitalist neighbor.
   ``The larger our economic problems, the worse the climate will
be for the elections,'' Modrow warned.
   East Germany's Communist Party will compete with new citizens'
movements and political parties in the May 6 balloting for
parliamentary seats and a role in the national government.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel planned a trip to East
Germany on Tuesday, his first official visit to a foreign country
since being named head of state Friday.
   In contrast with the unbridled overnight revelry, the East
German capital was nearly deserted during the short daylight on
Monay that was made drearier by a snowfall scattered by sharp gusts
of wind.
   The ADN news agency reported that 5.2 million Germans crossed
the inter-German border over the holiday weekend, including 3.7
million between the two sides of divided Berlin.
   Crumpled paper streamers, charred sparklers and fireworks
casings paved the streets and sidewalks of central East Berlin,
where 500,000 had gathered the night before to ring in the new year.
   At least 135 people were injured and one killed during the
raucous celebration when a tower of scaffolding near the
Brandenburg Gate fell under the weight of revelers seeking higher
vantage points from which to survey the scene along the Berlin Wall.
   Police from both East Berlin and West Berlin reported 77 people
were taken to hospitals and dozens of others were treated at the
scene.
