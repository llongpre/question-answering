   Germany marked the anniversary of the Berlin
Wall's collapse Friday, but some among the shivering crowds at
ceremonies said the joy of the event had faded because of pressing
economic problems.
   Friday was also the 52nd anniversary of the nocturnal rampage
against Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues that foreshadowed
the Holocaust. In East Berlin, about 3,000 Jews attended a
commemoration of the Nov. 9, 1938 Crystal Night pogrom, named for
the shattered glass left by Nazi thugs.
   A monument to German reunification - a four-foot-square section
of the dismantled wall - was unveiled at one of the border crossing
points where thousands of East Germans streamed across last year in
unheard-of freedom.
   The monument was inscribed with the message: ``Berliners came
together again.''
   But in contrast to the wild celebrations that began
spontaneously on Nov. 9, 1989, events for the first anniversary
drew smallish crowds. Newspapers printed sober editorials about the
problems of unemployment in the economically stunted former
communist part of Germany, which officially united Oct. 3.
   ``It's true a whole new world has opened up for us,'' said East
Berliner Erika Brut. ``One wants to celebrate, but there are so
many problems.''
   She and her husband, Thorsten Brut, 42, a teacher, were among a
few hundred people shivering in near-freezing weather late Friday
on Marx-Engels Square in East Berlin to watch a documentary of last
year's wall opening.
   ``Looking at the pictures, it all seems so long ago. Our lives
have changed completely in the last 12 months,'' Brut said.
   The main symbol of the former division of Berlin and Germany,
the Brandenburg Gate, was busy with a flea-market atmosphere of
rows of tables offering everything from Soviet army caps to chips
of the wall for sale.
   But the wall on which last year's celebration occurred is gone.
Six sections of it stand on a nearby square so visitors can see
what it looked like.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose policies allowed
the Soviet client governments of Eastern Europe to crumble, was
greeted Friday in Bonn with a hero's welcome.
   Gorbachev and Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed a 20-year treaty of
friendship and cooperation. Grateful German leaders said they hoped
they could help Gorbachev solve the Soviet Union's desperate
problems.
   Berlin's Jewish community for the first time held its main
commemoration of Crystal Night in the splendid Ryke Street
synagogue, in a working-class neighborhood of East Berlin.
   Heinz Galinski, leader of the Central Council of German Jews,
said the significance of the wall's opening ``remains a half-truth
if it conceals the earlier imprinted meaning of the date.''
   ``And half-truths are not a good foundation for building a
healthy future.''
   Galinski said Germans have never acknowledged fully the horrible
events that started on Kristallnacht. Six million Jews had died by
the time World War II ended in 1945 and Germany lay in ruins and
partition.
   Germany had 540,000 Jews before the war but only 30,000 now,
Galinski said. He recalled the words of Gen. Lucius D. Clay, one of
the American military commanders in Berlin: ``Democracy in Germany
will be measured by the extent Jews can live there.''
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, unveiling the wall monument at
Bornholmer Bridge, also referred to the memory of Crystal Night,
but concentrated on the immediate past and the future.
   ``For Germans, Nov. 9, 1989, was the happiest day in the postwar
era. Those who witnessed it will never forget,'' said the Social
Democrat.
   Momper will share the mayoralty with his East Berlin
counterpart, Tino Swierzina, until elections on Dec. 2 when unified
Germany holds its first parliamentary elections.
   The Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament, met in
Berlin on Friday for the first time in 31 years, joined by newly
elected representatives from the five eastern states created when
East Germany joined the West.
   The rapid pace toward unification has thrust the nation into a
host of new problems. Lawmakers are faced with rising unemployment
in former East Germany and claims on property by Germans who fled
before the wall was erected in 1962.
   The subject of who deserves credit for the spontaneous opening
of the wall is still a point of debate.
   While East Germany's former Communist rulers have claimed some
responsibility, it was not clear whether their Nov. 9 decision to
permit freedom of travel meant freedom to emigrate permanently or
also permission to have unhindered contact with the West.
   Last week, a report in the former official Communist newspaper,
Neues Deutschland, said medium-level security officers decided on
their own to let the pressing crowds through the wall, fearing
border guards would be killed otherwise.
   ``It was the thousands of East Berliners who gathered at the
border crossing and demanded to be let through,'' Momper said.
``The power of the individual defeated the system of oppression in
former East Germany.''
