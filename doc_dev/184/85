   The little man in the brown jacket looked out of
place among the dark-suited German dignitaries today at the grand
midnight reception in the Reichstag building to celebrate Germany's
reunification.
   But someone in the government had remembered Lothar Nitsche and
made sure an invitation went out to him.
   As a teen-ager in 1948, Nitsche dared to tear down the Soviet
flag from the Brandenburg Gate when the Cold War was gripping
Berlin.
   ``I have a good life, effective today,'' the 60-year-old Nitsche
said in the old parliament building a few minutes after the
Germanys united at midnight. ``Our dreams have come true.''
   His story, told in the copies of old documents he carries like a
talisman, was of a youth spent in war and turmoil - and a brief
moment of fame 42 years ago.
   The Soviets had imposed their blockade on West Berlin in June
1948, and the U.S.-British airlift was keeping the city alive with
food and other supplies.
   Berliners feared the Western world would forget them, and on
Sept. 9 hundreds of thousands of demonstrators poured into the huge
square before the Brandenburg Gate to protest the Soviet
stranglehold.
   Nitsche, then just 18, said he had run through the gate when he
saw that another young German had managed to reach the top of the
structure and remove the Soviet flag but was frightened away by
Soviet gunfire before he could throw it to the ground.
   ``We were shouting Freedom! Freedom!'' he said, ``and people
said to get the flag down.''
   Nitsche and another young man - ``I never saw that man before in
my life'' - climbed the gate, reached the red flag and threw it
down, he said.
   The dramatic rebellious act was highlighted in newspaper
accounts of the day's demonstration and the Soviet gunfire used to
disperse the crowd.
   Nitsche said the Soviets tried several times to kidnap him
because of his notoriety.
   The U.S. Army took him out of Berlin for his safety and gave him
jobs for years afterward in Giessen, West Germany, where he married
and had three children.
   Despite his brush with the Soviets four decades ago, Nitsche
said he believes Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ``the man
of the century'' for what he has done to permit the unification of
Germany and end the division of Europe.
