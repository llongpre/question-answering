   Soviet troops goose-stepped away from a memorial
to victims of World War II for the last tme Saturday as they
handed over control of an enclave in western Berlin to civilians.
   Several hundred people watched a Soviet honor guard escort the
final two-man watch away from the large memorial in Tiergarten, the
sprawling park just west of the Brandenburg Gate, which used to
mark the division of East and West Berlin.
   Soviet officers and Berlin legislators laid wreaths before the
memorial and bands played the national anthems of the Soviet Union
and Germany.
   The mayor of the Tiergarten borough, Wolfgang Naujokat, said
civilian police would guard the monument and it would be kept as it
is - including the two old Soviet tanks and two artillery pieces
that were part of the Red Army's advance into Berlin in 1945 as
Nazi Germany fell to the Allies.
   After the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the monument became an
odd Soviet enclave 500 yards inside West Berlin where the guards
had to be relieved by convoy.
   The end of the Soviet guardpost at the memorial was a provision
of the Soviet-German treaty of friendship and cooperation signed
Nov. 9 - the first anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall -
by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
