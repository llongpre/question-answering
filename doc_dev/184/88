   Former President Reagan, who once used the
Berlin Wall to give the East bloc a rhetorical bashing, grabbed a
hammer and chisel Wednesday to take a few real whacks at the
remnants of the Cold War barrier.
   Onlookers applauded and shouted, ``We love you Ronnie!'' and,
``Bravo, Ronnie!'' as the 79-year-old Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
walked through the landmark Brandenburg Gate between East and West
Berlin.
   A hundred yards further, the Reagans came to one of the few
remaining sections of the concrete wall in central Berlin. The
ex-president, his tongue sticking through his teeth in
determination, gave it a few smacks.
   In a speech three years ago in West Berlin, Reagan challenged
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall.''
   Reagan's presidential library in Simi Valley, Calif., has a
three-ton section of the wall, which was opened in November
following an autumn of pro-democracy demonstrations. The two
Germanys are scheduled for reunification Oct. 3.
   ``Looking back one year, who would have believed that today you
would be in the final stages of uniting your country?'' Reagan said
in a speech later to a forum on Germany's future.
   ``Today, that symbol of separation, the Berlin Wall, is a fading
memory. Yet, for nearly three decades it had separated the German
people and it symbolized the lack of freedom for those in East
Germany to travel, to speak out, to live and to work where they
chose.''
   He predicted the united Germany would be a partner in Western
security and economic growth and join international peacekeeping
forces.
   ``It will also serve as a symbol of the unquenchable human
spirit, a spirit embodied in the terms `freiheit' _ freedom _ and
`einigkeit' _ unity.''
   After visiting the wall, Reagan visited East German Parliament
President Sabine Bergmann-Pohl. She said she hoped Reagan would
return to visit the country after unification.
   Berlin was Reagan's first stop on a 10-day European trip that
also includes scheduled stops in Poland, the Soviet Union and
Italy. On Thursday, he is expected to travel to Bonn, the West
German capital, to meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Reagan said he believes the course for reforms in Eastern Europe
began in the early 1980s when West Germany agreed to accept bases
for cruise missiles with nuclear warheads and the U.S. began its
``Star Wars'' Strategic Defense Initiative, conceived as a shield
against nuclear strikes.
   Both decisions forced the Soviets to accept a treaty on
intermediate-range nuclear forces and focus more on internal
economic problems, he said.
   ``Inevitably, they loosened their grip on the states of central
and Eastern Europe,'' Reagan said.
