   A cacophony of drums, saxophones and
firecrackers pierced the air early today and fireworks illuminated
the Berlin Wall as tens of thousands of people from East and West
celebrated New Year's together.
   Tens of thousands poured in both directions through the newly
opened Brandenburg Gate each hour, and thousands more scaled the
wall and tumbled into the other Germany as border guards watched
with amusement.
   In a revival of the city-wide street party that erupted when the
Berlin Wall opened Nov. 9, young people scrambled atop the divide
to take in the scene on both sides, bobbing and rocking to the
erratic rhythm of the concert without conductor at Brandenburg Gate.
   Hammers clanged against chisels as hundreds mined the wall for
souvenirs.
   After midnight, some scaffolding supporting an outdoor
projection screen near Brandenburg Gate collapsed under the weight
of revelers, killing a man and injuring 135 people, East Germany's
official ADN news agency reported. Seventy-seven of them were
hospitalized, it said.
   ADN said drunks and a carpet of broken glass from champagne
bottles hindered rescue workers.
   In other border areas, police police arrested 68 neo-Nazi
activists overnight after they tried to stage illegal
demonstrations. Authorities in both German states had formed joint
patrols to prevent disturbances threatened by right-wing radicals.
   A West Berlin counter-culture group had appealed to Berliners on
both sides of the crumbling divide to bring musical instruments and
inspiration to the battle-scarred gate, for a concert to fete the
first New Year's in four decades that Germans have celebrated
together.
   ``We just wanted to be here for it. It's fantastic,'' said
21-year-old Kerry Bundgaard of Phoenix as her father videotaped the
scene.
   ``The wall is open for the first time in my life. We want to
celebrate along with everyone else,'' said Hans-Juergen Witfeld,
who traveled from the Ruhr Valley city of Dortmund with eight
friends to spend the holiday in cold and misty Berlin.
   At midnight, fireworks filled the midnight sky over Brandenburg
Gate. The soot-stained monument was swathed in smoke as young
people from around the world clamored atop the surrounding wall and
scaled even the tarnished bronze chariot that crowns the columned
gate.
   Since East German authorities began punching holes in the
graffiti-splattered concrete that had severed Berlin since 1961,
the wall has become more a bridge than a barrier.
   Tour buses from throughout Europe shuttled thousands to the
heart of the party, a stretch of pock-marked wall between the
Brandenburg Gate in East Berlin and a towering Christmas tree on
the west side.
   Tourists filled every hotel and restaurant to capacity on both
sides of the wall and jammed streets and parking lots with
impromptu parties.
   Enterprising youth like 15-year-old Salim Mussa hawked chips of
the wall for up to $30, West Berliners rented out hammers and
chisels, and the West German government operated a mobile
information booth for any East German visitors considering
relocation in the West.
   Border police said they had no estimate of the numbers crossing
between the two Germanys.
