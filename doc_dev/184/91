   Germany still has two names, two governments,
two armies. But to many East Germans, Sunday was the day the two
nations became one.
   ``The wall is falling, the borders are open. Now we have West
German money,'' said East Berliner Marita Schulz, 43, after she
withdrew 1,000 new marks from her bank account.
   ``To us, this is it.''
   During the next few months, politicians in both nations will
work out the constitutional mechanics of holding common elections
and forming a single government by year's end.
   But many East Germans saw the opening of the door to Western
commerce and cash as the culmination of last autumn's
demonstrations against Communism, when the hunger for Western
prosperity was an engine that helped drive a revolution.
   The capital was calm and quiet on Sunday, the day the economies
and the social welfare systems of the two German states were
officially merged.
   East Germans did not flock to banks to withdraw their money, and
officials were not predicting a spending spree when stores, now
filled with Western products, opened on Monday.
   Many East Germans planned to make one long-delayed purchase,
such as a car or vacation. But the average amount withdrawn was
only expected to be 800 marks ($490).
   The fear of mass unemployment as East Germany tries to quickly
shift to a free market has brought an air of caution to the country.
   During the day Sunday, East Berlin was positively placid
compared with the raucous, New Year's Eve-style scene that greeted
the coming of the currency union at midnight.
   Thousands of midnight celebrants poured into the city's main
square, Alexanderplatz, where mass demonstrations last fall helped
bring down the former Communist government.
   West Germany's Deutsche Bank, in a publicity stunt that
backfired, opened the doors of its new branch on the square at
midnight to mark the arrival of the currency union.
   It was believed to be the only bank in the country to open
before 8 a.m.
   Thousands of people stood in line, thousands of others crowded
around them and a writhing mass of people packed the door, which
was eventually broken.
   Ambulances took two people away when they became faint.
   The first man in line _ and the first person in East Germany to
withdraw his new West German marks _ was Hans-Joachim Corsalle, 41,
a coal delivery man from East Berlin.
   He took out 2,000 marks ($1,200) and planned to use it to take
his family on vacation. He got a gift basket and a 100-mark bonus
for being the first East German in line.
   ``Never saw a line this long, except for the line at Elvis
Presley's funeral,'' he said.
   Corsalle showed up about four hours before the doors opened in a
modest bid for immortality.
   ``Before I came here I told my wife this is going to enter the
history books,'' he said. ``And it will.''
   Anke Kirchner, 24, a teacher, thought the currency union was the
grimly realistic flipside to the exuberant, idealistic
demonstrations that brought down the Berlin Wall.
   She was at the historic Brandenburg Gate, a symbol of old
Berlin, when the wall was first breached Nov. 9. That celebration
was fun and spontaneous, she said. But the line at Alexanderplatz
was instead a pushing, shoving crush for cash.
   ``I thought it would be nice to come here and be part of the
action,'' she said. ``But this was rather depressing.''
