   Three years after challenging the Soviets to
topple the Berlin Wall, Ronald Reagan has returned to stroll across
the old ``death strip'' where chunks of the wall are now peddled as
tourist souvenirs.
   Reagan, 79, accompanied by his wife Nancy, arrived in West
Berlin at 12:20 a.m. Tuesday aboard the late publisher Malcolm
Forbes' private Boeing 727 with the jaunty slogan ``Capitalist
Tool'' painted on its tail.
   The former president is beginning a 10-day trip that will
include stops in Poland, the Soviet Union and Italy.
   Reagan has come back to a city vastly changed since 1987 when he
stood near the infamous Cold War barrier andchallenged Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall.''
   The Berlin Wall has come down, and East and West Germans mingle
freely on the streets. Their governments have agreed to unify on
Oct. 3 into one German nation which will be a member of NATO.
   Ulrich Abshagen, a West Berliner active in U.S.-German
friendship programs, said he heard Reagan's speech at the wall in
June 1987 but doubted the barrier would open in his lifetime. Yet
the 60-year-old businessman went ahead and bet a case of champagne
the wall would soon be opened.
   On Wednesday, Reagan is scheduled to visit the area where he
spoke at a celebration of Berlin's 750th anniversary.
   ``There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be
unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom
and peace,'' Reagan said during the speech directed at Gorbachev.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate,'' Reagan said. ``Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.''
   The first sections of the wall opened in November after the
pro-democracy revolution swept out East Germany's communist rulers
and Gorbachev indicated the Soviets would not stop moves toward
German reunification.
   ``Everyone knew the Russian troops would not interfere,'' said
Gerhard Behrendt, an environmental official in the new East German
government. ``Gorbachev spoke on a Friday, and on Tuesday the old
system was finished.''
   Reagan, 79, plans to walk through the landmark Brandenburg Gate,
which is now surrounded by tourists and vendors selling pieces of
the wall, bits of East Bloc army uniforms and postcards showing the
celebrations last November.
   Reagan is scheduled to meet for dinner Tuesday with Berlin
community leaders.
   In Warsaw, he will meet leaders of Poland's Solidarity-led
government and give a speech to Parliament.
   He is also scheduled to address the Supreme Soviet in Moscow and
meet with Gorbachev.
   The BZ daily of the Springer group of newspapers, a partial
sponsor of Reagan's visit to Berlin, praised Reagan for his
``beautiful prophecy'' of 1987.
