<HEAD>EAST BERLIN: health problem.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``So is pubic health itself,'' added Karl, as he drove past the
huge Charite hospital where he was born. ``Every day more and more
doctors and nurses are leaving. How can the state survive?''
   Life is far from being a cabaret, but the swinging nightclub
district off Friedrichstrasse that Christopher Isherwood's Sally
Bowles made famous is coming alive again with movie houses and
theaters crowding the somber East bloc embassies.
   ``Like haircuts, opera and theater are two-thirds cheaper over
here,'' Rudi pointed out. ``We get world famous artists, and
sometimes we see films like `E.T.' and `Out of Africa' ahead of
West Berlin.''
   That morning the box office had opened at Bertolt Brecht's
restored Deutsche Theater for a new production of Brendan Behan's
``Die Geisel'' (The Hostage).
   And there are cabarets, my Yugoslav comrade advised, in the
``five-star hotels for foreign guests paying in hard currency. Here
there are no street walkers like you see on the Kurfurstendamm, but
call girls work the big hotels. Oddly, the price is the same: 190
marks, West German only, bitte.''
   There is one mildy smutty magazine but staid East Berlin has
nothing to compete with the sex shops or strip joints that drew
long lines of wall crossers over the weekend in West Berlin. So the
question now looms: How do you keep 'em passionate for factory
production quotas after they've seen ``Erotes Berlin _ Super Sexy
Video and Sauna Parlor''?
   ``They give us football and circuses,'' laughed Walter the
waiter who has no fondness for the police, but is a passionate fan
of the Dynamos, the highly rated East Berlin police soccer team,
which is called a football team here, and can't wait for Circus
Busch to come back to town with ``those dancing Russian bears.''
   East Berlin's Christmas fair, now rising near Alexanderplatz
with amusement rides, clowns and games for the kids, will draw
thousands from the other side of the wall. But there already is a
parade of toys from that direction.
   ``East German toys are really quite charming,'' said a U.S. Army
sergeant who has been in West Berlin for six years. ``Hand crafted
things like music boxes and nutcrackers, but now that the wall is
open, the electronic stuff labeled `batteries not included' are all
the rage over here.''
   American, French and British forces stationed in West Berlin
frequently visit the East. A favorable currency exchange rate of
10-to-1 enables them to eat gourmet meals, with caviar and imported
champagne, for less than $5.
   Cigarettes are cheaper east of the Spee River, but ``terrible,''
everyone agrees, except for Cuban cigars. Despite the popularity of
coffee shops, coffee is either unavailable or ersatz.
   Records and cassettes are cheaper on this side, and books are a
bargain, although the selection is limited. Marx and Engels are
always available, but Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``Perestroika'' was
gone in a few hours.
   ``Here a best seller is how fast, not how many,'' explained
Ludwig, a student from East Berlin's Humboldt University, waiting
in line at the checkout counter of the downtown Volksbuch store.
   ``They only print so many, regardless of how well it sells.''
   Ludwig, who was wearing a Los Angeles Raiders jacket, said he
was majoring in computer sciences but now hoped to study in West
Berlin because he had been told that East Berlin's large
electronics industry ``is already two generations behind the
West.'' Before the wall went up in 1961, some 5,000 East Berliners
crossed to the Free Berlin University.
   He and some of his friends agreed that one of the most startling
changes in the past week has taken place on ``Aktuele Kamera,'' the
nightly news on East German TV.
   Once rated the most boring program in Europe, with its endless
array of apparatchiks reciting party gains and goals, it suddenly
has become what Ludwig calls ``a fun show.''
   ``Every night there is another expose of corruption. Some party
bigwig getting special privileges for his family or extra
advantages. It's intriguing,'' he said.
   Something intriguing definitely is taking place on an almost
daily basis in East Berlin. No wonder the British Cultural Center
on Unter den Linden has Graham Greene featured in large window
displays. You almost expect Harry Lime to jump out of a sewer and
do a TV interview with Dan Rather at the Brandenburg Gate against a
background of zithers playing ``The Third Man Theme.''
