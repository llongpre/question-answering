   This is the wall everyone watches.
   ``The German question is open so long as the Brandenburg Gate is
closed,'' says West German President Richard von Weizsaecker. That,
too, is painted on the wall.
   Farther south at Potsdamer Platz is the new opening where
photographers and gawkers jostle with Berliners exercising their
new mobility. A billboard records that this barren ground was, in
1932, jammed with autos and electric trolley cars. On June 16,
1953, three years before the Hungarian uprising, rock-throwing
Germans in the Eastern sector took on Soviet tanks.
   Wallbangers have been most active where the barrier takes a big
turn to the east. One hole along the base was large enough for a
head to poke through, but most were no more than five inches wide
even though several feet long.
   Bad concrete, it's obvious, was not one of the failures of East
German socialism.
   Two young Americans tried their luck with a piece of angle-iron
and waved a little U.S. flag through the opening.
   ``Get your flag out of here!'' a German woman shouted in
English. ``Show your flag in your own country, not here.''
   ``But this is the American sector,'' one of the Americans
explained.
   ``American sector!'' the German snorted. ``Do you think this is
some kind of colony?''
   The wall here is at its rudest. It swallows streets, blocks
trolley tracks, crowds front porches along Niederkirchener Strasse.
   Proximity breeds creativity. One artist glued shards of mirrors
on the wall, creating an illusion of transparency.
   Another covered five concrete panels with a huge blue question
mark on an aquamarine background, over a tormented caption:
``Humanity is steering toward a black hole, we're gaining speed,
but the narrowest passage is ahead.''
   A misshapen cross says ``Erich Honnecker RIP,'' the misspelling
of his last name a final insult to the hardline East German leader
who was ousted Oct. 18.
   Beyond Checkpoint Charlie and the Checkpoint Charlie Museum,
fresh mums were tangled in the barbed wire entwined on a wooden
cross. It tells of the agonizing death of Peter Fechter, who was
shot and lay by the wall for 50 minutes in 1962, bleeding and
calling for help.
   West German police could only throw first-aid packs over the
wall. Finally, East German guards carried Fechter away.
   West Berlin changes from park to slum to suburb to woodland to
lakeshore, but the Wall hardly changes for miles.
   There are places of rustling leaves and birdsong, and little
desolation rows where the sidewalk is squeezed between the Wall and
the various high walls and barbed wire of private property.
   In the run-down Kreuzberg area, Berlin's ultra-left
``autonomen'' have parked their wooden caravans and shacks in the
shelter of the wall. A couple of goats were tethered across the
street, and small signs warned, ``No photographs.''
   ``No reunification. No Fourth Reich,'' said a banner hanging
from a ramshackle tower.
   ``The freedom that they mean is for the Deutsche Bank,'' said
another banner, referring to the country's biggest bank.
   Way out in suburbia, one of the newest crossings is a bridge
leading into Potsdam. The East Germans have long called it the
Unity Bridge.
   Such communist irony inspired some professionally painted
official graffiti on the Western shore: ``Those who gave it the
name of the Bridge of Unity also built the wall, strung the barbed
wire and made the death strip, and so hindered unity.''
   Back in the city, one German spoke for millions: ``Ich Verstehe
diese Mauer Nicht.''
   ``I don't understand this Wall.''
