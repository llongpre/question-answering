   Last Friday was the 26th anniversary of the world's most symbolic obscenity -- the Berlin Wall. 
East Berliners have tunneled under it, crashed through it and flown over it. 
Many others have succeeded only in receiving bullets in their backs. 
Ronald Reagan recently challenged Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall. 
His voice must have carried, for on anniversary day last week a crowd in East Berlin gathered near the Brandenburg Gate to shout, "The wall must go!" 
It's said these are different times. 
Maybe their shouts will carry across Poland to the Kremlin.
