<TEXT>     One year ago, thousands of Germans joined Chancellor Helmut Kohl for a
midnight ceremony at Berlin's Reichstag, the country's historic parliament
building. Many were moved to tears of joy as Germany ended its Cold War
separation.;   Twelve months later, Kohl said he feels "every reason for
optimism" about the future.;   Yet Germans are grappling with dozens of
problems.;   For nearly three weeks, right-wing extremists have been attacking
refugees and their shelters across the country. The assaults, window-smashing
and rock-throwing have brought back memories of Adolf Hitler's Nazi thugs.;  
"Hatred of foreigners, anti-Semitism and intolerance toward minorities are
still dangers for German democratic society and its political credibility,"
the OETV public employees union warned.;   In the state of Brandenburg near
Berlin, police said they were increasing patrols in expectation of further
right-wing attacks today.;   Other difficulties range from the local classroom
to the international community.;   A top-to-bottom revamping of eastern
Germany's schools has led to confusion and frustration among students.;   It
will take years to decide who owns land and other property in former East
Germany. The region remains volatile, despite the "boom town" atmosphere
created by western German investors.;   Increasingly, eastern Germans are
saying that some aspects of their lives were better under communist rule.;  
Eastern German businesses have collapsed, leaving more than 2.5 million out of
9 million workers unemployed or in make-work jobs. Of the eastern Germans who
are employed, about 400,000 commute to former West Germany to make a living.; 
 Meanwhile, the jobless rate in western Germany remains a relatively low 6.2
percent, and the economy there is booming.;   Soon after the Berlin Wall fell
Nov. 9, 1989, Kohl put Germany on the fast track to unification. He had to
convince other nations that a Germany of 80 million people would not pose a
threat to world peace.;   In a radio interview this week, Kohl said concern in
foreign capitals "has not been overcome."  </TEXT>
