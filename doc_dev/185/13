<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; COUNTY; FESTIVAL; LIST  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE Santa Clara County Fair's musical slate could best be likened to the menu
of a favorite neighborhood eatery -- nothing fancy, just tried-and-true fare
for the entire family. A careful musical gourmet should be able to find some
top-drawer blues, country and soul acts on the fair's two main stages. All the
acts on the 8,000-seat grandstand and 4,000-seat amphitheater stages are free
with fair admission.;    On the grandstand stage: Vaqueros Musical teams with
six other Hispanic acts for Noche de Estrellas III at 7 p.m. Saturday. The
rockin' oldies act Flash Cadillac has a concert -- complete with fireworks --
slated for 8:30 p.m. Sunday. Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons trot out those
memories with an 8 p.m. performance next Friday. Country diva Kathy Mattea,
who's been a major-league draw ever since she hit in '88 with "18 Wheels and a
Dozen Roses," has an 8 p.m. concert Aug. 3. The Bay Area's own living blues
legend, John Lee Hooker, teams with veteran rocker Elvin Bishop and jump-blues
specialists Little Charlie &amp; the Nightcats for an 8 p.m. show Aug. 4. Soul
crooner Freddie Jackson checks in for an 8 p.m. concert Aug. 9. The
Temptations, Motown's veteran stars, work at 4 and 8 p.m. Aug. 10.  </LEADPARA>
