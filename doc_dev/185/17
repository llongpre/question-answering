<DESCRIPT>  FAMILY; CHILDREN; ENTERTAINMENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THERE'S plenty of family entertainment this week with two area county fairs
running concurrently. The Santa Clara County Fair will run daily through next
Sunday and the San Mateo County Fair and Floral Fiesta opens Tuesday and runs
through Aug. 18. Both have displays, exhibits, petting zoos, extensive
carnival rides and headliner entertainment. And both have discount days.
Taking advantage of these discounts can amount to a tidy savings if you're
escorting a number of children to the events.;    The 47th annual Santa Clara
County Fair has all the old favorites and many new attractions, including the
Gold Heist Stunt Show, a Kids' Korral, Jeff Allen's Magic Windows and elephant
rides.  </LEADPARA>
