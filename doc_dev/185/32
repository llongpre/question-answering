<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; COUNTY; VOLUNTEER; MAN; DEATH; OBITUARY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Losing an election for Santa Clara County sheriff in 1970 didn't keep Larry
Romero from serving the cause of justice.;    Mr. Romero, a longtime Santa
Clara resident who has died at the age of 84, earned the respect of the law
enforcement community when he ran a surprisingly effective primary campaign 20
years ago. Soon afterward he volunteered as a reserve deputy sheriff to
oversee jailed drunken drivers in a weekend community service program.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Almost every Saturday and Sunday for 10 years, Mr. Romero, a retired
mechanical engineer, would get up at 6 a.m., go to the Santa Clara County
Jail's Elmwood facility, pick up a bus load of inmates, and take them out for
a day of cleaning the county's streets and parks.;    Mr. Romero, a Los
Angeles native, spoke Spanish fluently and always sought to play fairly with
his crew, said his son, Lawrence Jr.;    "He was really big on
rehabilitation," Lawrence Romero Jr. said. "He had a way with inmates. He
didn't baby 'em. He treated everyone with dignity.";    Mr. Romero died
Tuesday at a San Jose convalescent home after several recent strokes. He will
be memorialized this morning in a funeral in Santa Clara.;    For more than 30
years, he was an engineer at hospitals in Los Angeles and Santa Clara
counties, including stints at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View and Good
Samaritan Hospital in San Jose.;    He was a ship engineer in the U.S.
merchant marine during World War II, helping ferry ammunition from San
Francisco to Australia. But the tug of law enforcement was also strong. His
father was a former Los Angeles police officer who died in the line of duty.; 
  Mr. Romero was a Red Cross volunteer, a member of the Elks for more than 50
years and a charter member of the Santa Clara Elks lodge.; Lawrence J. Romero;
