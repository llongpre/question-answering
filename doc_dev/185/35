<LEADPARA>  The Fox Theater; (box) The Fox Theater, on First Street in downtown San Jose,
was once a movie palace, then a run-down dump. It's now on its way to glory
again; by 1994, it should be the residence of Opera San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the meantime, its Spanish baroque grandeur needs a couple of million
dollars' worth of cosmetic and structural renovation. The cosmetic rehab,
already begun, is breathtaking. Have a look for yourself: Open houses are
planned each weekend, starting today, through July 7. Today's is in honor of a
visit by the Theater Historical Society of America, a group that wants to save
sites such as the Fox.;    Hours vary slightly, but in general, the lobby is
open 6-11 p.m. Fridays-Saturdays, noon-sundown Sundays. There's no charge.
Information: (408) 293-2000.;    -- Judith Green;  TOO MUCH JOY; (box)
Attending a club show by the up-and-coming New York band Too Much Joy is like
being trapped in a van with four perpetually adolescent party dudes, a tape
deck loaded with great early '80s new wave rhythms and a keg of Meisterbrau.
Regardless of what musical highway the lovable foursome ends up on, you can
count on dazzling repartee on subjects from capital punishment and blackjack
strategy to seducing the girl next door.;    The band's recently released
third album, "Cereal Killers," is a gem far more polished than the previous
"Green Eggs and Crack" and "Son of Sam I Am." In an era where most rock music
takes itself far too seriously, these guys know a good joke when they sing
one.;    Too Much Joy will wax ecstatic Saturday at the Catalyst, 1011 Pacific
Ave., Santa Cruz. Tickets for the 9:30 p.m. show, also featuring the Royal
Crescent Mob and the Jones Band are $5 advance, $6.50 at the door. Call (408)
423-1336. Sunday, Too Much Joy and the Royal Crescent Mob hold forth at
Slim's, 333 11th St., San Francisco. Tickets for the 9 p.m. show are $10,
advance and at the door. Call (415) 621-3330. Monday, the Royal Crescent Mob
and Too Much Joy wrap up their local tour with a 9 p.m. show at the Edge, 260
California Ave., Palo Alto. Tickets for the show, also featuring the local
band Short Stories, are $9 advance, $10 at the door. Call (415) 324-3343.;   
-- David Plotnikoff;  FLORENCE WEEK; (box) The Florentines are coming and
they're worth lining up for.;    What's behind the onslaught? It's all part of
settimana fiorentina, Florence Week, Sunday through next Friday, when Santa
Clara County jumps into the patronage arena, sponsoring a bunch of musical,
artistic and food festivities that don't require an Italian heritage to
appreciate.;    (check) The opening event offers a treat for local
chamber-music buffs: A rising young European string quartet, the Quartetto di
Fiesole, performs Mozart's Adagio and Fugue in C Minor, Mendelssohn's A Minor
Quartet, Op. 13, along with the Fourth Quartet (1934) of the important
modernist G.F. Malipiero. The concert is 7 p.m. Sunday at the First Unitarian
Church, 160 N. Third St., San Jose. Tickets are $15. Call (408) 286-5111.;   
(check) Two Santa Clara exhibitions feature sculptors from Florence and San
Jose and Florentine Renaissance architecture. The Triton Museum of Art
presents "Florence -- Santa Clara: Two Schools of Sculpture," Monday from 7 to
9 p.m. (continues through July 28). The de Saisset Museum at Santa Clara
University hosts "The City of Brunelleschi," opening Tuesday (reception 7-9
p.m. Wednesday) and running through Aug. 10.;    (check) Macy's joins the
festivities, importing food as well as Florentine and native chefs, who will
demonstrate their specialties. Carol Field, an authority on Italian cuisine,
discusses and prepares food of the Tuscan region at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at
Macy's Cellar, Valley Fair Shopping Center. Noted Florentine chefs Milvia
Labardi and Michele Bosco create authentic Tuscan dishes 6:30 p.m. Thursday.; 
  (check) Live it up like the Medicis at the Florence Week Concert Gala, 6:30
p.m. next Friday at St. Joseph Cathedral and the Fairmont Plaza, when Opera
San Jose singers perform arias from Verdi and Puccini, with Barbara Day-Turner
conducting. Stroll through the piazza, dine on Italian specialties prepared by
local restaurants and wine from Santa Clara Valley vintners. Tickets to the
black-tie evening are $50, $75, $100 and $150. Call (408) 299-2323.; --
