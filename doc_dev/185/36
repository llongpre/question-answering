<LEADPARA>  Before they could even have a Santa Clara County fair 50 years ago, they had
to find a place to hold it.;    It had been nearly three decades since any
kind of fair was held in Santa Clara County, and more than half a century
since the last full-fledged fair. The old fairgrounds along The Alameda had
long since been subdivided.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     During a 1937 luncheon, San Jose Chamber of Commerce directors began
discussing reviving the fair. A fair association was established that summer
and by 1939, the association had decided an ideal location would be the
99-acre Miramonte stock farm -- complete with a horse-racing track -- on Tully
Road.;    It was even for sale -- $55,000 to an outsider, $40,000 if the
county wanted to buy it. Over another lunch the next year, fair boosters
decided to telegraph the owner to see if he would sell the property for
$35,000. He telegraphed the next day that he would, according to "A Brief
History of the Santa Clara County Fair" by retired Mercury News columnist Dick
Barrett.;    The property was among 10 sites, including the San Jose Speedway
property at Alum Rock Avenue and King Road and two locations on Saratoga
Avenue near Payne Avenue, that were then submitted to the board of supervisors
for consideration. The Miramonte property, with the support of Supervisor Joe
McKinnon, was selected.;    McKinnon "ramrodded it through the board,"
remembers Francis Zingheim, a longtime fair association director. "The way
McKinnon went, the rest went.";    The summer of 1941 was a busy one at the
new fairgrounds, as crews transformed a stubble field with broken fences into
a suitable setting. One expense was shoes for the county jail inmates who were
recruited to help with the work.;    There were about 175,000 people in Santa
Clara County then, and fair attendance hit nearly 100,000, despite the
sometimes chilly weather that accompanied its October run.;    Governor spoke
at opening;  On opening night, nearly 12,000 people shivered as they watched a
couple marry on stage and listened to Gov. Culbert L. Olson extol the richness
of the Santa Clara Valley. They inspected the exhibits, gorged themselves and
danced under a harvest moon.;    It was so cold that night that even the
horses and cattle in the display barns wore blankets, according to an account
in the Mercury Herald.;    A week of fair events followed. Some of the biggest
draws for many people were the horse races and horse shows. Agricultural,
livestock and home arts exhibits, including a baking contest, also were
popular.;    There was a huge mechanical robot that asked girls for their
phone numbers, a parade and a kids' day when schools filled 84 fair-bound
buses.;    War delayed return;  The 1941 fair was successful beyond
organizers' dreams, and they promised to return with an even more spectacular
event the following year. But World War II intervened, and the second fair of
the modern era wasn't held until 1946.;    There's been one every year since,
and the fairgrounds are still on the Miramonte property. But a lot has
changed. More land has been purchased. Attendance has soared -- more than
666,000 people came last year. It's a much more commercial fair now.;    "At
that time, it was more of a hometown deal," said Zingheim, who at age 79 still
works at the fair each summer. In the early days, he recalled, people used to
say, "The only time you get to see all your old friends is at weddings,
funerals and the county fair.";    But for at least one guy, the fair was a
bust. W.S. Payton, a janitor, worked all summer on his hooked rugs to complete
them in time to enter them in the fair, but he didn't belong to any women's
organizations or the Grange.;    He wasn't allowed to compete.  </TEXT>
