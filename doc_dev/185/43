<LEADPARA>  NEAR the railroad tracks in a funky neighborhood of once-thriving canneries in
San Jose, the Garden City Athletic Club has been converted from an old carpet
warehouse to a proving grounds for both club boxers and would-be world
champs.;    For some, it is also a bridge from the streets or even jail to
respectability, maybe fame.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Inside, elevated 4 1/2 feet above the floor, is a boxing ring. To one side,
heavy, leather punching bags hang still, waiting for the next future world's
champ to bang himself into shape.;    Stevie Romero, San Jose's contribution
to world class Lightweight Division contenders, trained here for his first
comeback fight after serving seven years in prison for drugs. He won on Jan.
15 in Reno, by the way.;    Lupe "Little Guns" Gutierrez, who's ranked among
the top three or four featherweights in the world, is due in to work out any
second.;    David Vedder, a world class light heavyweight, trains here, too,
when he's not driving a Santa Clara County Transit bus. A year ago February,
he was one fight away from a crack at Tommy Hearns' world title. But a guy
named Virgil Hill stopped him in 12 rounds.;     LARRY VALLES was not in their
class. He was just a loose-change club boxer with four or five pro fights
behind him, most of them losses. Still, he was supposed to show up Monday at 5
p.m. but didn't, which was weird because he'd been as regular as a clock --
Monday through Friday, 5 p.m. -- since he got out of Santa Clara County Jail
in late February.;    "I can't say he had any real promise as a contender,"
says Jeff Grmoja, a big guy with Yugoslavian blood who is also the club's head
trainer. "But he said he was tired of wasting time. He wanted to put the
street life behind him and get back into shape.;    As for street life,
Valles' record wasn't so hot, either. He'd been in and out of jail since 1982.
He'd get busted for drugs. He'd do time. He'd hit the streets, and the cycle
would start again. Except sometimes, he'd resist arrest, which would cause a
judge to tack on more jail time.;    "I told him there was a way to prove
himself. First, he had to drop 45 pounds," Grmoja recalls. "He hit the bags,
shadow box every day. In one month, he went from 195 to 175 pounds. As far as
I could tell, he looked clean. He had a new lady friend, drove a new truck.
Things were looking up.";    "That's why I was so shocked when I got the phone
call.";    Larry Valles, 28, died from multiple gunshot wounds Monday
afternoon, four hours before he was supposed to work out at the club.;    HE
DIED at a house in East San Jose, only a few blocks from his own apartment and
also near an apartment where his sister lives.;    People in the house gave
conflicting stories. At first they told sheriff's deputies that Valles had
arrived at the door bleeding from gunshot wounds. Later, they said he might
have been shot inside the house.;    The cops are still sorting things out.
Motives? It would be easy to guess. Drugs do come to mind.;    Jeff Grmoja,
who gave Valles a chance to start over and watched him train faithfully every
day, can only sit in his office surrounded by fight posters of Duran, Cooney,
Foreman, Tyson, Sugar Ray Leonard and a guy named Mike Jameson, who knocked
him out in his only pro fight, and wonder.;    "You and I know that a lot of
these kids don't come from upper-middle-class backgrounds. For a lot of them,
fighting is a ticket out of trouble. This kid had been working his . . . off
to get out.";    It would be a nicer story, of course, if Larry Valles had
gotten himself into fighting shape, if one day, he'd earned his shot at the
title and brought it home to the east side of San Jose.;    But would that
have prevented his shooting death or just postponed it?  </TEXT>
