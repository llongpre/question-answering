<LEADPARA>  Andy Carlson loved to hunt elk -- with bow and arrow or rifle.;   He would
hunt overpopulated areas, said his sister, Clare Quinn, and eat the kill. His
elk burgers at San Francisco 49ers tailgate parties were the talk of the
parking lot.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He even slipped a hibachi into Shoreline Amphitheater, where tailgating is
illegal, and drove people to distraction with the savory smell of his burgers
wafting from the grill inside his van, said his sister.;   He also loved to
fish for trout and climb mountains -- in the Trinity Alps, Mount Shasta and
Half Dome in Yosemite.;   For the last six years, after graduating from
Saratoga High School and going to Oregon State University for a couple of
years, he worked at Mount Eden Winery.;   On the ridge of the Santa Cruz
Mountains where the fog from the Pacific and the winds from the Santa Clara
Valley meet and provide a varietal mix for growing, he took care of the small
winery's vineyards.;   He lived on the estate in a two-bedroom house, said
Jeffrey Patterson, Mount Eden's winemaker. "He was a very fun-loving, very
articulate kind of guy who lived one day at a time.";   When his vineyard
foreman failed to show up for work on Sept. 3, Patterson looked over the
vineyards but found nothing until Sept. 7. Then he discovered Andy Carlson's
body in his pickup in a remote spot in the Nikkel Vineyard.;   The cause of
death was carbon monoxide poisoning, the Santa Clara County Coroner's Office
said, from the truck's exhaust. Three suicide notes were found in the truck.; 
 "It was a shock to virtually everybody who knew him," Patterson said.;
