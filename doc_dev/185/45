<LEADPARA>  For the poor of the South Bay who face a bleak Thanksgiving holiday, so little
has been donated while so much is needed.;   More families than ever are
seeking assistance this year from charitable organizations that provide meals
for the poor, the homeless and the unemployed.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And yet, with Thanksgiving less than two weeks away, the contributions of
food from communities of plenty have been a trickle, not a torrent of good
will.;   The charities need turkeys and the makings for stuffings and
trimmings. They need hams, canned fruit and vegetables, and staples such as
rice and beans and potatoes. Or they need money to buy food for the needy.;   
"With the way the economy is right now, the way food donations are coming in,
things could be very tight," said Joey Scanapico of CityTeam Ministries in
downtown San Jose.;   Some examples:;   (check) CityTeam Ministries officials,
worried they wouldn't have enough food to provide the 3,500 Thanksgiving Day
meal boxes promised to needy families, cut off sign-ups for the boxes early,
shutting out at least 100 families.;   (check) The Salvation Army was feeding
about 1,100 people daily in San Jose. Now it's more than 3,000 a day.
Thanksgiving turkeys are in short supply.;   (check) Tri-City Volunteers in
Fremont provided holiday food baskets for 300 low-income families last year.
Executive Director Barbara Chabot estimates that this year they'll be asked to
help 400. "Right now we have zero turkeys," Chabot said Thursday.;   (check)
In 1990, the Second Harvest Food Bank in San Jose, which supplies a large
number of charitable organizations in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties,
provided other agencies with food for about 62,000 people a month. This year,
the number has risen to more than 74,000, said Executive Director Mary Ellen
Heising.;   It is hard to keep up.;   Food isn't the only charitable item in
short supply. So is money.;   Donations to Catholic Charities of Santa Clara
County, which assists 20 organizations, have declined 10 percent this year,
while the demand for services has increased 5 percent, said Michael Tomars,
director of administration.;   The one bright spot appeared to be donations to
United Way of Santa Clara County, which could wind up its annual contribution
campaign, now about half done, by exceeding its $26.5 million goal, said Buck
McCleneghan, United Way's senior vice president.;   United Way donations at
valley firms show an 11.3 percent increase over last year, he said. The goal,
for funds that assist 114 local organizations, is 7.5 percent higher than last
year.;   But with the holidays approaching, the immediate need is for food.
Even by closing reservations early, CityTeam expects to provide 1,000 more
families with food boxes this Thanksgiving than last -- nearly a 30 percent
increase. Overall, the organization will feed about 14,000 people.;   "The
poor are being squeezed on both ends," Scanapico said. "Because of the
recession, people aren't giving as much. Also because of job layoffs, more
people are coming for help.";   The recession "has hit, and it hit hard," said
Barbara Redding, family services supervisor for the Salvation Army.;   In
addition to its regular program, the Salvation Army expects to help 525
familes for Thanksgiving, and anticipates aiding 3,000 families for
Christmas.;   That's evident to Heising at Second Harvest from some of the new
clientele being served by the agency's food bank supplies.;   "Not only are
they serving more people, but (for) longer periods of time," she said. "And
they are poorer, and they are younger. Most of the people who come to the
programs are families with children, 85 to 90 percent of them.";   Charity
officials hope that, as in years past, contributions will pick up when the
holiday draws near.;   A big payoff could come soon. Since Nov. 8, Boy Scouts,
Cub Scouts and Explorers have been going door to door to leave bags for people
to fill with canned and boxed goods. Today they will return to pick up donated
items for the food bank.;   But throughout the region, the situation is mostly
bleak.;   In Gilroy, St. Joseph's Family Center served 300 families last year.
This year, said associate director Pearl Blea, "we have an awful lot of new
people coming in, just out of work, mostly families. . . . We just hope for
the best."; WHERE TO GIVE; Here are some of the charitable organizations that
