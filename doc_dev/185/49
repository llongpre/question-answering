<TEXT>   BEST BUY; Budget bloomers; Many nurseries are clearing out summer flowering
plants to make way for fall stock. Look for garden mums, priced from $2.50 in
one-gallon containers; azaleas, from $5 in one-gallon containers, and tree
roses, from $12 in two-gallon containers.; VEGETABLES; Pinch tomatoes; Pinch
blooms off tomato plants to direct their energy into fruit that already has
set (started to develop). Tomatoes that set after Labor Day fail to mature in
time for harvest before the first frost. Fruit toward the end of the season is
always smaller than the first fruit of the summer.; FREEBIES; Get a catalog;
Whether you need information on drought-time water management or pest
management, the University of California's updated publications catalog is the
book for you. The 1991 catalog contains hundreds of titles on field crops,
soil, chemicals, farm management, forestry, fruits and more. The catalog can
be ordered free from ANR Publications, Dept. NR, University of California,
Oakland 94608-1239. It is also available from most county Cooperative
Extension offices, and from the Agricultral Information and Publications
office at the University of California, Davis.; YOUR CHECKLISTY; (box) Prolong
blooming on tuberous begonias, dahlias and fuchsias by pinching off faded
flowers.; (box) Divide and replant crowded perennials.; (box) Trim bearded
iris foliage to fans six inches from the rhizomes.; (box) Plant new irises and
divide others if they failed to bloom well this year.; (box) Plant autumn
blooming crocus now for a harvest of true saffron in November.; (box) Dry
flowers for arrangements.; (box) Shape evergreen hedges for the last time this
year.; (box) Disbud camellias, leaving only one bloom bud per branch to get
the largest blossoms.; THE LAST WORD; Hand in glove; Disposable latex or vinyl
gloves like the ones dentists use are useful in the garden too. Tough, yet
allowing sensation, they are good for plucking insect pests off tomato and
bean plants and protecting hands digging in wet soil. A box of 100 costs less
than $20 at the grocery or drugstore and should last several years.  </TEXT>
