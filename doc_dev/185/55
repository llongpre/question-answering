<TEXT>  Berry nice; Look for starter plants of strawberries, $4 for 25 bare-root
plants. You'll find two choices -- ever-bearers produce a little fruit over a
long season, while the June-bearers  or spring-bearers  produce one big crop.
Space roots about 12 inches apart with the crowns slightly above the soil
line. Bait for snails.;  PLANT; The bare-root route; Plant bare-root fruit and
nut trees, roses, berry and grape vines, artichokes and asparagus. Sow beets,
lettuce, radishes, peas and spinach. Transplant broccoli, cabbage and Brussels
sprouts. Put in azaleas, camellias and rhododendrons. Plant bulbs for spring
and early summer bloom such as agapanthus, calla and canna lilies.;  LAWN; Hit
the weeds; Lawn weeds are ready to spring into action. Apply a pre-emergent
control before the seeds of crabgrass, foxtail and annual bluegrass begin
their dirty work. These weeds are a particular problem in lawns that are
growing poorly or underwatered -- which describes most of our lawns going into
this fifth drought year.;  CHECKLIST; (box) Don't get impatient and start
hacking away at freeze-damaged plants. It's too early. Wait until you see new
growth -- mid-February to mid-March -- and then cut obviously damaged parts.;
(box) Apply dormant oil spray to fruit and nut trees to knock out
overwintering  pests. Apply peach leaf curl controls at bud swell stage.
Before the buds swell is too early, and after the blossoms open is too late.;
(box) Prune fuchsias to shape them before they break into leaf. Hold off on
heavy pruning until they've leafed out later this spring.  </TEXT>
