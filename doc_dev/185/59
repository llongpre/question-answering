<LEADPARA>  WHY do we stand, glasses raised (as if we needed a reason)? To take part in
California Wine Appreciation Week, which is under way with a scattering of
festivities planned at wineries all around the Bay Area.;   The State
Legislature proclaimed the week to coincide with the grape harvest, which is
just beginning. A late bud break after heavy March rains combined with
unusually cool summer temperatures to make this one of the latest harvests in
memory. Grape growers estimate that this year's harvest, or crush, started
about three weeks later than most and may continue into November.  </LEADPARA>
