year -- will be held today and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. There'll be
bands, arts and crafts, a children's play area and, of course, lots and lots
of food, mostly made with garlic, naturally. Tickets are $8 for adults and $2

Garlic Train, which will deposit you at the Gilroy depot. Shuttle buses run
between the depot and the festival. Cost is $37 round trip from Peninsula
stops and $32 from San Jose. Call (800) 934-2472 for information.;    Drawing

food booths, beverages offered by 10 wineries and five micro-breweries, two
entertainment stages and up to 600 arts and crafts booths. There also will be
