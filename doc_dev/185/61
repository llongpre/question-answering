<LEADPARA>  HERE'S some more advice culled from lending professionals.;   (box) Lenders
usually quote the lowest rate possible, but each of the factors below could
raise the rate you may actually be eligible for.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Before you call around, make a list of all those factors and ask for a
quote based on them. Things that will affect the rate include the loan amount,
what percentage that amount is of the home's value (or loan-to-value ratio),
will you refinance the loan costs or pay them up front, at what point in the
loan process do you want to guarantee the rate, and any credit problems.;  
(box) One way to weed out bad quotes is to ask "If I came down to the office
today, could you guarantee me that rate in writing?" There are nine different
ways lenders "lock-in" or guarantee a rate. The quote you get over the phone
often is not available unless you are approved for the loan that day. So, when
comparing loans, you probably should be specific and ask the rate for a loan
with a 30-day or 45-day "lock," so the rate will be good when the loan
closes.;   Two warnings: If you do get a guaranteed rate, only a few lenders
will give you a lower rate if they go down before the loan closes. And if you
don't, say based on a lender's comment that rates "can only go down," remember
it is only a prediction.;   (box) The rate is only part of the equation. When
comparing loans, make sure to ask what the costs to get the loan will be.
Different lenders use different terminology that can add hidden costs. Some
lenders will charge lower points (one point equals 1 percent of the loan
amount) but then add a loan origination fee. Also, it's worth considering
getting a higher rate with lower points if you will not be in the house a long
time, and visa-versa if so.;   (box) Santa Clara County deputy district
attorney Albert Bender was instrumental in helping set regulations that now
require lenders to also advertise the annual percentage rate, or APR, which is
a way to compare loans including costs. But even Bender says the APR is not a
perfect way to compare loans, because lenders interpret the regulations
differently.;   (box) When you find a loan with terms you like, get all those
terms -- and especially a rate that's advertised as guaranteed -- in writing.
It is not uncommon in low-rate times like these for lenders to pullout of
"guarantees" if rates rise. You are always safer -- and have legal recourse --
if the guarantee is in writing, says Earl Peattie of Mortgage News.; (box) Get
professional advice from someone you trust, says Bender. "I've asked lenders
what some of the loans being advertised are, and they don't even know.";
IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; If you feel you are not being treated fairly by a lender,
you can make written complaints to the consumer fraud division of the district
attorney's office. For complaint forms in Santa Clara County, call (408)
299-8478; in Alameda County, call (510) 569-9281; in Santa Cruz County, call
