<TEXT>     Mr. Thomson came to San Jose to work for Gousha as controller in 1967 when
most service stations still gave away road maps. In those days, Gousha printed
90 million maps a year, said Barry Farris, manager of production for the San
Jose firm. Today, it publishes half that many, roughly the same as Rand
McNally, the other major map publisher in the United States.;    By 1973, Mr.
Thomson had moved up to vice president of operations for Gousha, then owned by
the Times Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times. He was named
president in 1975.;    Mr. Thomson retired in 1986, when Gousha was sold to
the book publishers Simon &amp; Schuster.;    Mr. Thomson grew up in Los Angeles,
served in the Army with occupational forces in Japan at the end of World War
II and attended Woodbury Business College. He became a certified public
accountant in 1955, working for Ernst &amp; Ernst accountants and teaching classes
at the University of California, Los Angeles until setting up his own CPA firm
in Grand Junction, Colo., in 1966.;    In San Jose, Mr. Thomson was a longtime
member of the board of directors for the Boys City Boys' Clubs of Santa Clara
County and served as president in 1978. He was also honored with the National
Golden Man and Boy award of Boys' Clubs of America. Boys City has changed its
name to Boys' and Girls' Clubs of Santa Clara County.;    In 1983, Mr. Thomson
was named to the San Jose Corps Advisory Board of the Salvation Army, and he
served on the board of directors and as president of the United Way.; RICHARD
