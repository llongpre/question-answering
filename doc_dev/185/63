<TEXT>     Despite 40 minutes of resuscitation efforts by several of the 220 people in
the sanctuary and paramedics, the Rev. Dr. Cole was pronounced dead,
apparently of a heart attack, at Kaiser-Santa Clara hospital.;    Church
member Bonnie Williams said the Rev. Dr. Cole had begun his Mother's Day
sermon about 11 a.m.;    "He was probably preaching for five minutes" before
he collapsed, said the Rev. Robert Wernersbach, associate pastor of the
church.;    The Rev. Dr. Cole had come out of retirement in January to become
interim pastor for the 310 members of the Santa Clara church, according to the
Rev. Richard Taylor, area minister for the American Baptist Churches USA.;   
The members of the Santa Clara congregation didn't get to know their new
senior minister well, said Wernersbach, "but we certainly got to know his
personality and were warmed and touched by it.";    "He was just a gregarious
and ebullient type of person, and that came through from the pulpit.";    The
new job was an extension of the Rev. Dr. Cole's third career, Taylor said. He
had earned his bachelor's degree in the early 1940s from Stanford and then
obtained his doctor of divinity degree from Eastern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Philadelphia.;    From 1952 to '59, he was president of the
California Baptist Seminary in Covina, said his wife, Ann.;    He returned to
school for his doctorate in psychology from London University, then set up a
private practice in Covina and became a professor at the Fuller Theological
Seminary in Pasadena.;    He moved to San Clemente in 1973 and, for the next
17 years until he retired in April of 1990, was pastor at South Shore Baptist
Church in Laguna Nigel.;     Donald W. Cole;  (box)Born: Jan. 12, 1920, San
