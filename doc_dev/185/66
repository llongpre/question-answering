<TEXT>     This is the waiting room of the Santa Clara County AIDS Program Central
Clinic in San Jose. In the week since Magic Johnson announced he is
HIV-positive, it's been an increasingly busy place, even though it's very hard
for some people to take this very simple test.;   "Nobody wants to come
through that door. It takes a big effort," said Bernie Zebrowski, a program
manager at the clinic.;   Some people on Friday have waited two hours.;  
Nearly 200 people a day have come in this week. The number used to be 50.;  
Officials in clinics in Palo Alto and Newark also reported increased demand
for testing.;   More married men;   Workers at the San Jose facility, on
Lenzen Avenue, have noticed a big increase in one particular group of
heterosexuals wanting the test: married men whose wives are expecting babies.;
  "Men are saying, 'I've been married four or five years, but I had
girlfriends before,' " said Sandy Gudino, an AIDS service adviser. "They
haven't been cheating, but they had other women before they were married and
now they're concerned about their wives and unborn children.";   She said
about a third of the men who came to the clinic Friday fell into that
category.;   Some men don't wait that long.;   "I had recently admitted to my
girlfriend that I had sinned or whatever," said one 20-year-old Santa Clara
man, who asked to remain anonymous. "I asked her straight up if she wanted me
to get tested and she said yes.";   Zebrowski said he's also seen an increase
in members of minority groups.;   Before drawing blood, trained counselors
take minimal demographic information and ask questions that can help determine
the likelihood that the person might have the human immunodeficiency virus.;  
Not enough counselors; Because of the onslaught this week, Zebrowski had to
borrow counselors from other areas of the building.;    "I was pretty
surprised how many people were here," said the Santa Clara man, who was lucky
to wait just 50 minutes. "Just coming and doing this whole thing is really an
experience. I feel woken up . . . It's making me wonder about the history of
all the women I've ever had sex with.";   But he couldn't say he felt better
now that he'd been tested. "I'll feel better in two weeks.";   That's how long
it will take to get his results. He'll have to come back to the clinic in
person, give his confidential number at the front desk and wait to be called
into a small room, where a counselor will tell him if he tested positive or
negative.;   The first wave of people who were spurred by Johnson's
announcement can return to the clinic for their results Friday.;   At Newark
Health Clinic, where free anonymous testing is done Thursday mornings, Ruth
Young also noticed an increase this week, but didn't have exact numbers. "We
saw more couples coming in," she said. "Normally, they're single
individuals.";   People who called the Tri-City Health Center in Fremont on
Friday had to wait through five minutes of a recorded message before someone
answered. And then they learned the soonest they could get in for a free,
anonymous HIV test would be Nov. 27.;   In Palo Alto, Margaret Wylder, HIV
project director at the American Red Cross, reported an "explosion of testing
requests." She was waiting after hours Friday for test tubes for next week's
tests.;   Usually, Wylder tests only on Mondays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. This
week, she added some slots Thursday. "We did four tests the week before
(Johnson's announcement)," she said. "Now the phone is ringing off the hook.";
