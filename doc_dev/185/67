<TEXT>     For Mr. Wahl, son of a pre-Prohibition brewer in Hollister, "his day" began
in 1926 when he was transferred to Santa Clara to supervise two Standard Oil
stations. He remained with the oil company until 1947, when he "retired" to
spend more time with his land and mortgage investments.;    In 1950, Mr. Wahl
was elected to the Santa Clara Board of Freeholders, which proposed the city's
change to a council-manager form of government. Mr. Wahl was part of a
generation of Santa Clarans who "were good friends and who helped build and
form the community," Warburton said. Many of those board names -- George
Sullivan, Joseph Farfan, Frank Guerrera, William P. Kiely, Anthony Toledo,
A.J. Roll, Frances Scott and Anne Salberg -- are now dead, said Warburton, who
was chairman of the board.;    Mr. Wahl also was a member of the Santa Clara
Planning Commission.;    Among Mr. Wahl's investments were his home on College
Avenue and a house that became Adolf's Restaurant and later the source of
Adolf's Seasonings.;    He also was an investor in Santa Clara Savings &amp; Loan,
for which he was named a director and which grew to two branches and
eventually was sold to Gibraltar Savings and Loan.;    Mr. Wahl's first wife,
Maxine, who was involved in many Santa Clara charitable organizations, died in
1974. His second wife, the former Reba Jean Mills, lives in the Menlo Park
home where he died.; Walter A. Wahl; (box)Born: Sept. 14, 1898, Hollister,
