<LEADPARA>  They came not to praise the tearing up of Highway 101. They came to bury it,
symbolically speaking, in a little metal box filled with 1991 artifacts for
future generations to find.;   Politicians, wearing suits and dresses and
flinging shovelfuls of soil. A high school band. School kids. Neighbors of the
massive project to build a new interchange at Highway 101 and Alum Rock Avenue
and widen the freeway passing under it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     They all came to the corner of Santa Clara and 30th streets to celebrate
and watch as a time capsule, about a cubic foot in size, was plunked 4 1/2
feet into the ground to mark the beginning of the end of a seven-year project
to widen Highway 101 in Santa Clara County.;   The last segment of the project
-- a $26.5 million job to widen the road and build new interchanges from McKee
Road to the interstate 280 and 680 junction -- officially started Thursday. It
is expected to be finished by the end of 1993. And when it is finished, an
ambitious plan to improve Highway 101 with money generated by an extra
half-cent sales tax, will end.;   "This is the final section so we want to
celebrate the event," said Will Kempton, executive director of the Santa Clara
County Traffic Authority, the agency coordinating the construction. "We
thought it was a pretty big deal.";   Kempton said the party at the Irmandade
Do Espirito Santo Plaza was warranted because the road project had been
debated, discussed and refined by the surrounding community for years. He
didn't have to say that the authority has worked deliberately to promote a
positive public image, hiring a public relations firm, opening offices in
affected neighborhoods and staging events similar to the groundbreaking to
herald projects that many view as necessary, but disruptive.;   Traffic along
Santa Clara Street slowed, in part to merge from two lanes to one because of
construction, and in part to gawk at the assembled policy makers in business
dress tossing dirt from gold shovels onto the box. The plan is for their
successors to dig the box up in 25 years or so. Among other items inside, they
will find photos of the area as it is now; a program from Thursday's ceremony;
a yearbook from Five Wounds School; pictures from Anne Darling Elementary
School; a magnetic Caltrans sign; student essays about transportation;
newspapers of the day in English, Portuguese and Vietnamese; a model
light-rail train; a San Jose International Airport Frisbee; and a
commemorative San Jose Sharks hockey puck.;   Well, they might find the puck.;
  Five Wounds eighth-grader Jerome Kelley of San Jose eyed the puck before the
box was sealed.;   "I'm coming back in 25 years," he smiled. "I'm getting
that."  </TEXT>
