<TEXT>     (box) Submission to it is made a condition of employment.;   (box)
Submission to or rejection of it is the basis of employment decisions.;  
(box) It unreasonably interferes with work performance or creates an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.;   (box) Victim does
not have to be the person harassed; he or she could be anyone affected by
offensive conduct.; State law;   (box) California law is similar to federal
law. Victim can file complaint with either federal EEOC or the State
Department of Fair Employment and Housing. The agency that gets a complaint
first prosecutes.;   (box) Victim has 300 days from date of alleged incident
to file complaint.;   (box) The state handled 1,744 complaints of sexual
harassment in employment in the year ending June 30, 1991.; Penalties;  
Employers convicted of sexual harassment may be required to:;   (box) Pay
attorneys' fees and court costs.;   (box) Reinstate employees.;   (box)
Provide back pay.;   (box) Post notice of rights in the workplace.;   (box)
Take other corrective actions.;   (box) There are no fines for employers under
federal law, but under both state and federal statutes, an individual whose
complaint is upheld could file civil suit for damages against employer.;  
(box) California once awarded compensatory damages to victims, but the Supreme
Court took authority away. The state can negotiate cash settlements for
victims because some companies would rather settle than face a lawsuit. The
settlement rate is about 28% statewide. A new law, SB 827, awaiting the
governor's signature, would restore the commission's authority to levy
compensatory damages (maximum: $150,000) and a fine (maximum: $50,000), which
would be split 50-50 between the state and the individual. If the governor
signs, the law takes effect Jan. 1, 1992.; Who to call;   U.S. Equal
