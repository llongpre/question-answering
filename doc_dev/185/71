<TEXT>     (box) 1990-91 favorite: Monta Vista.;     (box) Most improved: Lynbrook.;  
  (box) New coaches: Philippe Blin, Saratoga. Ramzi Tarazi, Fremont.;    
(box) Top players: Monta Vista: M Ralph Robertson, junior; G Kevin Shepela,
junior; M/D Damien Paskeicz, junior. Homestead: M James Kinsman, senior; D
Jason Neff, senior. Lynbrook: F Tim Burleson, junior; D Scott Murano, junior;
D Darrin Franzen, freshman. Saratoga: F Josh Desmond, junior. Los Gatos: M
Harendra Goontilleke, senior.;     (box) Outlook: Although Monta Vista
recently stumbled in a 2-1 loss to Cupertino, the Matadors are the team to
beat. They're ranked sixth in Santa Clara County and Robertson was an
All-Santa Clara County second-team selection and the Mercury News' county
co-sophomore of the year last season. But don't count out Lynbrook, ranked
10th, and Homestead, ranked sixth. Lynbrook's Burleson, who has 13 goals this
season, provides Lynbrook with one of Santa Clara County's most dangerous
scoring threats.;  MOUNT HAMILTON;     (box) 1989-90 champion: Santa Teresa.; 
   (box) 1990-91 favorite: Santa Teresa.;     (box) Most improved: Oak Grove.;
    (box) New coaches: Mousa Hosin, Oak Grove.;     (box) Top players: Santa
Teresa: M Matt Ball, senior. Independence: M Jose Badillo, senior; F Todd
Bellah, senior. Oak Grove: M Brian Follosco, senior; F Matt Henbest, senior.
Yerba Buena: M Luis Mendoza, senior. Lick: D Jerry Brito, senior. Mt.
Pleasant: F Richard Elemen, senior; D Ray Hidalgo, senior.;     (box) Outlook:
There is a battle being waged for the four league-playoff berths among Santa
Teresa, Piedmont Hills, Oak Grove, Independence and Yerba Buena. Ball of Santa
Teresa and Badillo of Independence were co-juniors of the year in the county
last season.;  SANTA CLARA VALLEY;     (box) 1989-90 champion: Palo Alto.;    
(box) 1990-91 favorite: Palo Alto.;     (box) Most improved: Los Altos.;    
(box) New coaches: Jim Brown, Palo Alto.;     (box) Top players: Palo Alto: D
Andrew Harwell, senior; M Jason Blakely, senior; Los Altos: M Alberto Montoya,
junior; M Jesus Gil, junior; F Darren Gowdy, junior. Wilcox: F Kevin Spalding,
junior; M Tuan Tran, junior. Mountain View: D/M Ryan Inouye, junior. Milpitas:
D Blaine Current, senior.;     (box) Outlook: Palo Alto returned only three
players off of last season's championship team, but the Vikings remain a
"solid team," Brown said. Los Altos, whose midfield is anchored by Alberto
Montoya, a member of the U.S. national youth team, is considered the league's
dark horse. Palo Alto and Mountain View began the week tied for the STAL lead
at 4-1, although Palo Alto's loss was to the Eagles 3-1 on Jan. 8. The teams
meet again Jan. 31 at Palo Alto (2:45 p.m.).;  SANTA TERESA;     (box) 1989-90
champion: Leland.;     (box) 1990-91 favorite: Pioneer.;     (box) Most
improved: Gunderson.;     (box) New coaches: Marc Baker, Gunderson; Paul
Lester, Leland.;     (box) Top players: Pioneer: M Greg Dini, junior; M Dave
Orsburn, senior; G Glen Cederholm, junior; F Nick Alevizos, junior. Willow
Glen: D Cesar Lopez, senior. Leland: D Mike Murphy, senior; M Aaron Hart,
senior.;     (box) Outlook: It appears Leland's strangle hold on the STAL is
over. The Chargers, who have won the last six league titles and eight of the
last nine, had a 39-match unbeaten string snapped with a 1-0 loss to Pioneer
on Jan. 10. The Mustangs, ranked second in Santa Clara County, were strong
last season at 14-5-1 and returned several outstanding players, including
Dini, the Mercury News' co-sophomore of the year in 1989-90.;  WEST CATHOLIC; 
   (box) 1989-90 champion: Bellarmine.;     (box) 1990-91 favorite:
Bellarmine.;     (box) Most improved: Serra.;     (box) New coaches: None.;   
 (box) Top players: Bellarmine: D Ken Schneider, senior; F Armando Avila,
senior; D Tim Kipper, junior; G Brian Garcia, senior. St. Francis: F Eric
Naes, senior; D Rick Gallo, senior. Mitty: M Robert Austin, senior; M Taras
Zubrycky, junior. Serra: F Grant Gosch, sophomore; Ken Daniels, senior.;    
(box) Outlook: Bellarmine, the defending Central Coast Section Divison I
champion and ranked No. 1 in Santa Clara County this season, has a good shot
at repeating as titlist. The Bells are the only remaining undefeated and
untied team in the CCS at 14-0, and they lead the WCAL at 6-0. The Bells have
won 19 straight matches Excluding the league and CCS playoffs, they've gone 29
matches without a loss and 47 matches without a defeat in WCAL. St. Francis
and Serra could challenge Bellarmine. Bellarmine's Schneider was a second-team
All-Santa Clara County choice last season.;  WEST VALLEY;     (box) 1989-90
champion: Blackford.;     (box) 1990-91 favorite: Blackford.;     (box) Most
improved: Del Mar.;     (box) New coaches: Jim Hamner, Del Mar; Sean Worley,
Del Mar.;     (box) Top players: Blackford: M Huy Nguyen, senior; M Josh
Kyles, junior; F Seiji Sato, sophomore. Prospect: F Jeremy Buettner, junior.
Del Mar: F Dan Fisher, junior. M Jeff Barnwell, senior.;     (box) Outlook:
Nguyen, Kyles and Sato, All-Santa Clara County honorable-mention county
selections last season, have given Blackford a strong returning nucleus.
Prospect's Buettner was the league's outstanding player on offense in 1989-90.  </TEXT>
