<LEADPARA>  Funny Old Town; See Carl Guardino, transportation director of the Santa Clara
County Manufacturing Group, waiting for a trolley ride to Civic Center so he
can testify before the Board of Supervisors on fare box increases. See the
trolley pull into the Great America station and then keep right on going, just
as if Guardino weren't there. Hear Guardino muse, "Now how did that driver
know I was going to speak in opposition to the fare increase?" (They know,
Carl; they just know.) . . . When Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons perform
Friday at the Santa Clara County Fair, Vic Cistulli knows you'll recognize
some voices, even if you're not a nostalgia freak. "They've done about 20
jingles for me," explains Cistulli, who writes music for radio and TV
commercials. "You know 'Trust Us to Treat You Right -- Stevens Creek Toyota?'
That's the Four Seasons." Huh. And critics complain they don't write them like
they used to. . . . And then there's San Jose attorney Nick Lymberis and his
opera singer wife, Barbara Swartz, who worked hard replacing their electric
kitchen range with a gas model and then decided to celebrate -- by going out
to dinner. "We didn't realize until midway through our meal at the Silicon
Valley Capital Club that we weren't really thinking," Lymberis admits. S'all
right. Every diet needs an irony supplement now and then.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     FIRST PERSON -- They work long hours at the top. Before President Bush took
off for the summit, he called Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Ron
Whyte to tell him he was the nominee as San Jose's second full-time U.S.
District Court judge. "The call came a little after 10 p.m.," Whyte says.
"That made it after 1 a.m., Washington time." Bush was chipper and chatty,
though, and obviously still favoring the commander-in-chief military thing.
Instead of a simple goodbye, he closed with, "Well, over and out." . . .
Trumpet virtuoso Wynton Marsalis, who has been hanging out in Los Gatos while
working on his Paul Masson Summer Series gig, also knows a thing or two about
time and timing. Marsalis strolled into the Great Bear coffee house for a cup
-- just as the shop's sound system launched into one of his recordings.
Sometimes even real life comes with the right background music.;    PARTY
PARADE -- Despite 10 months of planning, it looked as if the San Jose garden
wedding of Ann Gates and Toby Tuttle would be one big mess after PG&amp;E
announced that repair work would cut off power to the neighborhood on their
wedding day. Calls to headquarters didn't help. Neither did appeals to the
Public Utilities Commission. But finally the pleas filtered down to project
foreman Vern Perria, who arranged schedules so that work would be finished
just in time to get the power back on for the caterer and the band. Gates and
Tuttle were hitched without a hitch. And Perria proved that PG&amp;E -- often
referred to as "a giant public utility" -- still is a lot of individual parts,
some with heart. . . . There was a different sort of problem for Dan Orloff of
San Jose's Office of Economic Development at a recent open house at his Taylor
Street penthouse apartment. (Yes, there's a penthouse there, atop a former
cannery at 10th and Taylor, and that's something San Jose needs more of -- old
canneries and warehouses turned into apartments and lofts.) But former
industrial buildings also have hazards; a departing guest accidentally kicked
a bottle near a door, breaking it -- and the bottle contained acid. "One of
those rare parties," Orloff notes ruefully, "where the rest of the guests are
escorted out by the toxics squad.";    ONLY IN SILICON VALLEY -- Message on a
license plate frame on a new Ferrari, spotted by Bob Norris on I-880 near 101:
