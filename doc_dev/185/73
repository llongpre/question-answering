<TEXT>     "He made me what I am today.";   Beverly Lucich's father was Horace "Luke"
Lucich, a longtime science teacher at Willow Glen High School in San Jose.;  
He died early Friday in a Los Gatos care facility, three short weeks after he
learned he had cancer. He was 64.;   "It was just amazing," said Beverly
Lucich, a criminal investigator for the Santa Clara County District Attorney's
Office. "He not only had me as his true daughter, but he had so many adopted
daughters. He was a father figure to them. I am so proud to have had him as my
dad.";   For nearly two decades, those adopted daughters, and sons, went to
room Q204 to learn about plants and animals -- and bugs -- from "Mr. Lucich.";
  The annual Cricket and Worm Eating Day probably was his most celebrated
teaching device.;   For putting live crickets or mealworms into their mouths,
his advanced biology students could earn five extra grading points. For 20
points, they had to chew and swallow.;   "The purpose of eating the worms is
to help them overcome their fear of creepy, crawly things, let them have some
fun and point out that this stuff has more nutritional value than some of the
junk food we eat," Lucich told then-Mercury News columnist Steve Lopez during
the fifth annual eating.;   In later years, Lucich loved to tell how, at
Lopez's going-away party, he got the columnist to eat a mealworm -- by
chaining his leg to a bar stool.;   But Lucich didn't get complaints about his
methods -- just praise, from students and parents and colleagues.;   For more
than a dozen years straight, his students were the most consistent winners at
the Santa Clara County Science &amp; Engineering Fair.;   Eight of his students
won top honors, scholarships and trips to the fair's international
competition, said his longtime friend and science-teaching counterpart at
Cupertino High School, Dick Schonert.;   Lucich's students participated in,
and he judged, numerous Junior Science and Humanities Symposiums administered
by Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California, Berkeley.;    He
won several Teacher of the Year awards.;   For much of Mr. Lucich's two
decades at Willow Glen High, his "wing mate in Q203" was Matt Green. "I taught
the kids how to spell biology," he said. "Luke made them into scientists.";  
"I was just a raw jock with a basic science background when I came to Willow
Glen," said Green, who still teaches and coaches at the school. "Luke took me
and made me into a teacher.";   Wartime and Luke Lucich's own boredom with
high school caused him to leave when he was a sophomore and enlist in the
Navy. He spent nearly 20 years in the service, including time at the tail end
of World War II "running from typhoons in the Kula Gulf" off the Solomon
Islands in the Pacific, said his wife of 41 years, Mary Ann.;   From Navy to
academia; While at his last duty station, Moffett Field Naval Air Station,
where he disposed of explosive ordnance and was a gunner on submarine-hunting
planes, Lucich started taking classes at San Jose State University, having
obtained his general equivalency diploma while in the Navy.;   Retired SJS
Professor Galen Bull knew Lucich as one of his science students and later when
Bull supervised his student teaching.;   "His classes were informal but
disciplined," said Bull, who continued his friendship with Lucich over the
years. "He understood the kids and he was demanding. He wanted perfection and
he was one of those who was capable of getting it.;   "At the time, I made the
comment that I thought he was going to be the best of the science teachers in
the valley.";   Lucich started that teaching career at Taylor Intermediate
School in Millbrae, then moved to Markham Junior High School on the same
campus with Willow Glen High. He began teaching at Willow Glen in 1971.;   'My
favorite things'; Nineteen years later, Luke Lucich told an interviewer on his
retirement, "I enjoy young people and I enjoy science. I got to combine two of
my favorite things and get paid for it.";   At the June 1990 commencement, he
added another milestone to that retirement. As a "member" of the Willow Glen
High graduating class of 1990, Luke Lucich received the high school diploma he
had shunned as a youth.;   When their teacher crossed the stage in his red cap
and gown, the 292 graduating seniors rose and applauded. He told them:;   "It
was worth the 47 years to be able to share this privilege with this fine group
behind me."; (box)Born: March 29, 1927, St. Louis, Mo.; (box)Died: Oct. 11,
