<DESCRIPT>  LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  I am a Vietnam veteran; I did 2 1/2 years in the country. I got dysentery,
malaria and was wounded, all in my last six months there. I saw things I have
never told anyone about. It took me years to work the nightmares out of my
sleep.;    And I have never been ashamed of being a Vietnam vet. As a matter
of fact, I am damn proud of it. That is, until I hear another vet whining
about what should have been.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Letters to the editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     I came home to the same things vet Samuel J. Riskie did (Letters, May 23).
The day after I was discharged, I went to work. I didn't come home looking for
a parade. My family welcomed me home and that's just what I needed.;    I have
probably said more about Vietnam in this letter then I have said in the last
20 years. I'm just tired of all the whining and the sniveling by vets. If a
vet's children can't get a fair education, they should take it up with the
school board. If a vet is out work, then he better get hot and find a job.;   
Didn't we learn anything from Vietnam? Look, I know what Riskie is saying, but
he shouldn't let his status as a veteran become a soap box. These are
different times. We should be happy that people are finally waving the flag
and not burning it.;    -- Shannon Vieth; Los Gatos;  COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS
PROMOTES GAMBLING; I applaud your "Lottery gamble costs education" (Mercury
News, May 26). Our government is far too eager in promoting gambling.;   
Santa Clara County Fairgrounds now offers a Watch and Wager Satellite Center.
It draws hundreds, many with toddlers and youngsters, thinking they will get
"fair" entertainment.;    What they get is a no-glitter casino. A full liquor
bar, gaming devices and television offering updated gambling odds. No
playground or children's activities. Even casinos have video games for the
children.;    I may be a sore loser, yet how can the people of Santa Clara
County promote an ill-gotten bar to make a fistful of dollars? What if card
rooms and cocktail lounges followed the County's Fair Association's example?
Is this how we should educate people to interpret the state's liquor laws?;   
California needs to protect the public interest, not to gain our interest.;   
-- Paul Kageyama; San Jose;  UC research still; favors chemicals; We
appreciate Scott Thurm's article ("Organic farming a growing trend," Mercury
News, May 28) but a clarification is needed. University of California
spokesman Al Donner says UC is getting a "bad rap" because "less than 10
percent of ongoing research is aimed at synthetic chemicals.";    However,
Donner fails to mention that less than 10 percent of UC's agriculture research
budget is aimed toward developing alternatives to chemicals. What is missing
is the other 80 percent, over $100 million.;    -- Richard Reed; Davis  </TEXT>
