<LEADPARA>  Charles Nagatoishi never let the pain of being interned within his own country
as an American of Japanese descent prevent him from creating beauty.;    After
spending six years in various internment camps, sometimes separated from his
wife, Dorothy, and their young son, Mr. Nagatoishi settled in Mountain View to
begin his own gardening and landscape business. He never advertised. The
company did not have a name. And he never lacked for work.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He retired from his business about four years ago because of poor health.
Mr. Nagatoishi died Saturday of a respiratory ailment at the age of 76.;   
"He enjoyed being outdoors," said his wife of 51 years, Dorothy. "Everybody
liked him. I thought he was a pretty good gardener.";    Born in Santa Clara,
Mr. Nagatoishi's family moved to Redwood City when he was still a boy. He
graduated from Sequoia High School there and met his wife.;    Charles and
Dorothy Nagatoishi were in business raising chrysanthemums when world events
intervened and they were ordered to an internment camp in Topaz, Utah, in
1941. Their first son was born in a camp in Tule Lake, and 11 days later the
family was split when Mr. Nagatoishi was sent to North Dakota. They were
reunited nine months later in Texas.;    The family was released and moved to
Mountain View in 1947 where Mr. Nagatoishi established his gardening and
landscaping business. A self-taught gardener, he depended on word of mouth to
attract new clients, his wife said.;    And as much as he enjoyed working with
trees and flowers, he always found time for a much-loved hobby.;    "He loved
fishing," she said. "He was always going fishing."; CHARLES NAGATOISHI;
