<TEXT>     Sal Rancadore had phased into retirement several years ago and had had
heart surgery recently, but his death was unexpected to friends and
colleagues, said Colleen Goodart, a counselor at Mission Chapel.;    She said
that when the senior Alameda saw Mr. Rancadore's name listed for services at
the mortuary Wednesday morning, he said:;    "I never thought I'd live to see
his name on that board.";    Mr. Rancadore had apprenticed with the senior
Alameda after he was licensed by the state Board of Funeral Directors and
Embalmers in 1935, at the depth of the Great Depression.;    "Ignatius
Rancadore had a lot of property, but we had no money," Alameda said. "All we
had was guts.;    "(Sal and I) didn't work seven-eight hours a day. It was
15-16 hours a day. We did our own preparations, went out on call and never had
a squabble" in their long partnership, he said.;    Sal Rancadore had worked
with his father, who owned San Jose Canning Co., before obtaining a degree
from Santa Clara University in 1931.;    During World War II, he was a
civilian flight instructor for Army Air Forces pilots.;    He had memberships
in San Jose Elks Lodge No. 522, the Italian American Heritage Foundation and
La Rinconada and Indian Wells country clubs.;    When his younger son and
daughter were growing up, he alternated weekends with them, said his wife,
Marciel. One weekend he would take his son Tom to race Go Karts, and the next
he would take his daughter, Connie, to her quarter-horse riding events, she
said.;    Mr. Rancadore's hobby was hunting and trapshooting. He was a
champion skeet shooter, said his son, ranking second or third in the state
during the 1940s and '50s.;    He was a charter member of the California
Indians, a shooting club, as well as the Amateur Trapshooting Association.;   
Every now and then, he'd ask his senior partner for a little time to go
hunting.;    "Boy, I sure agreed to that," Alameda said, "because he always
brought me a duck or two.";     Sal J. Rancadore;  (box)Born: Sept. 14, 1908,
