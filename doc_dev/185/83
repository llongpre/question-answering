<LEADPARA>  Once in a while in the years just before World War II, Jimmy Odou could stand
5-foot-4 in the morning.;   That was just tall enough to make it into the Army
Air Corps -- especially after he put himself in a chiropractor's harness and
hung by his neck.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Later in the day, he settled some.;   So he'd get someone to drive him over
to the Selective Service office early.;   It never failed, though, that
whenever he made the height, "he would flunk the blood pressure test," said
his brother, Eugene, a Montebello physician.;   "I don't know how many times
he tried.";   Jimmy Odou was known as the most daring pilot at Thunderbird
Field in Phoenix during that war, said his wife, Shirley, but he never flew as
a pilot in the Air Corps or the Army Air Forces.;   Instead, as a civilian
flight instructor, he taught Chinese, British and American cadets how to fly
PT-13 Stearmans without losing one in training, his brother said.;  
'Two-Cushion Odou'; His students would autograph their graduation yearbooks to
"Two-Cushion Odou" because their instructor had to sit on two parachute
cushions so he could see out of the cockpit.;   After the war, Mr. Odou stayed
in Arizona to obtain his bachelor's degree in science education from Arizona
State University.;   He taught at the Indian school in Phoenix for a time, but
then decided to change back to airplanes.;   He studied engineering part-time
and went to work as a stress and weight engineer for Convair, later moving
north to Santa Clara and a taking a job with Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. in
Sunnyvale.;   For eight years, Mr. Odou taught math at Opportunities,
Industrialization Center West in Menlo Park, and he also worked as a stress
analyst at Moffett Field.;   But asthma forced Mr. Odou to leave the Santa
Clara Valley for part of the year, and he began growing organic navel and
Valencia oranges at Strathmore, in the San Joaquin Valley near Porterville.;  
Goods for farmers markets; For a dozen years, Mr. Odou shuttled between his
home in Santa Clara and his fruit ranch in Tulare County, scratching out a
living and selling his oranges at farmers markets in San Rafael, San Francisco
and San Jose.;   Shirley Odou, a former teacher and political activist,
remained in their Lafayette Street home and "drove the Santa Clara City
Council bonkers.";   Jimmy Odou's best year was 1990, said his wife, but then
came the big freeze. "He lost 50 percent of his navel trees," she said.;   On
Friday, Mr. Odou was cutting weeds when orange tree branches apparently
knocked him off his tractor.;   He suffered severe chest injuries and died at
the scene, the Tulare County Sheriff's Department said. James Joseph Odou was
72.;   "He had such bad luck," his brother said.;   "I say he was a victim of
the freeze," his wife said. "He didn't have any money, but he didn't want to
sell the grove because he couldn't stand to give up any of his (13) cats.";  
Shirley Odou doesn't know what she'll do with the grove, but she will go down
to retrieve a few cats.;   "I know he'd want me to bring up some of them.";
