<LEADPARA>  The Mount Hamilton Athletic League dual-meet race figures to get a strong
front-runner when Oak Grove (2-0), ranked second in Santa Clara County, plays
host to sixth-ranked and two-time defending-champion Overfelt (2-0). "These
are the two schools to beat in our league, no question about it," Santa Teresa
Coach Rudy Guevara said. "And I think Oak Grove has the edge. They have a lot
of experience and depth, especially in the upper weights. Overfelt has talent,
but they aren't that strong in some weights." Oak Grove is led by senior Matt
Tyrrell (15-0), who has won two titles at 130 pounds and one title at 125 in
tournaments this season. Overfelt has two undefeated wrestlers in Edgar
Bautista (15-0) at 103 pounds and John Sanchez (13-0-2) at 189. Both were
all-tournament choices at the Vacaville and Clovis-West dual-meet
invitationals. In the California Wrestler newsletter, Sanchez is ranked second
in the state in the 189-pound class, Tyrrell is fourth at 125, and Bautista is
fifth at 103. Thursday, 3 p.m., at Oak Grove.  </LEADPARA>
