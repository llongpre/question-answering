<LEADPARA>  SOME people have a nose for news. Bill Graham has a nose for venues. The
venues of the moment are ski resorts that Graham is commandeering for rock 'n'
roll during the summer.;    The "Mid-Summer Music Festivals" are a series of
shows that will unfold under the auspices of Bill Graham Presents in June,
July and August at facilities usually known more for their snow packs than
their decibel levels.  </LEADPARA>

he's the toast of a new long-form video. "You're The Top: The Cole Porter
Story" (Island Visual Arts, $24.95) is a one-hour tribute to the man who wrote
such epochal hits as "Night and Day," "Anything Goes" and "I Get a Kick Out of
You." Narrated by Bobby Short, the video is out this week.;    ASTOUNDING
