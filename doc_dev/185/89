<LEADPARA>  WHEN gardeners say "chill out, baby," they're talking about their fall garden,
not imitating their kids' latest patter.;   You will have better luck with
cold-season crops if you plant varieties that are suited to South Bay growing
conditions, says Nancy Garrison, farm adviser for the University of California
Cooperative Extension in Santa Clara County.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     To keep on top of developments, Garrison oversees field-test plantings of
new and old varieties to determine the best performers for this area. Some old
favorites have been tossed out, she says, and some new varieties added,
"although sometimes the oldest varieties are still the best ones.";   Here is
the 1991 updated list of recommended cold-season vegetables:;   Cabbage; No
lack of choices here. There are early varieties, late varieties, red ones and
green ones, Chinese cabbage and savoy.;   It's a space hog, but cabbage is
also among the biggest producers in the winter garden, if you can beat the
cabbage worms and aphids.;   Plant from seed February through April, and then
July through August. Use started plants from September through October. To
discourage aphids, spray with a soapy water solution (one part Ivory soap to
three parts water); for the cabbage worm, use one of the sprays for chewing
insects.;   (box) Best-bet varieties: Ruby Ball Hybrid, Earliana, Copenhagen
Market and Golden Acre, as well as the cabbage kin -- kale and collard.;  
(check) HOW TO PLANT: Cabbage likes average soil, in rows two feet apart.
Seedlings emerge in 10 to 21 days. When plants stand 1 to 2 inches tall, thin
to 18 to 24 inches apart. Avoid areas where cabbage grew last year.;  
Cauliflower; Cauliflower thrives when winters are cool. Plant from seed
February through March and July through August; transplants can be planted
September through October. Aphids and cabbage worms go for cauliflower, so
keep after them. (See controls listed under cabbage.);   (box) Best-bet
varieties: Snowball and Italian Purple.;   (check) HOW TO PLANT: Plant 18 to
24 inches apart in a sunny, well-drained area. Avoid a location where cabbage
family was planted previously.;    Broccoli; Despite President Bush's opinion
of broccoli, this crop has a big following in the Bay Area because it grows
exceptionally well here. Give broccoli the same treatment as cabbage and
cauliflower. Plant from seed February through March and July through August.
Use transplants September through October. Controls needed for aphids and
cabbage worms.;   (box) Best-bet varieties: De Cicco, Goliath, Green Comet and
Green Duke.;   (check) HOW TO PLANT: Sow seeds a half-inch apart. When plants
are 2 inches high, thin to 16 inches apart. Winter crops need 55 to 60 days,
depending on variety, to form heads. They need plenty of water and
applications of high-nitrogen plant food.;    Lettuce; It's one of the easiest
vegetables to grow from seed, and you will find seedlings of certain lettuce
varieties available as well. Whatever you choose, be sure to stagger your
crops for succession harvesting.;   (box) Best-bet varieties: Canasta, Sweet
Valentine, Oakleaf, Prizehead, Crispy Sweet, Red Salad Bowl, Antina, Sangria,
Salad Bowl, Marvel of Four Seasons, Tania, Rosa (head) Diana, Green Towers.;  
(check) HOW TO PLANT: Plant seeds a quarter-inch deep and one inch apart in
rows 18 inches apart. Set plants of heading varieties 12 to 16 inches apart,
loose-leaf types three to four inches apart. Lettuce needs lots of water. Keep
after snails and slugs. You can pull and eat the outer leaves without pulling
up the whole plant.;    Brussels sprouts; Brussels sprouts grow well along the
coast, and some people in the Santa Clara Valley have luck with them, too. The
trick is the weather -- as long as it is cool, each plant will provide about
100 sprouts. Plant from seed in February or August. Use transplants September
through October.;   (box) Best-bet varieties: Long Island Improved and Jade
Cross.;   (check) HOW TO PLANT: Plant seeds thinly in rows and cover with a
quarter-inch of soil. When seedlings are 1 to 2 inches high, thin to 18 to 24
inches apart. When harvesting, pick bottom sprouts first, working up the stem
as sprouts mature. They need lots of water and regular feeding with a
high-nitrogen fertilizer. Keep after the aphids.;    Peas; There are sweet
garden peas, sugar snap peas and edible pod peas. (Don't confuse these with
sweet peas, which are flowers.) They all need a long season of cool weather to
produce. They also need support -- a trellis, fence or pole. Figure on a
10-foot row of peas to feed a family of four. Plant from seed July through
September; transplants can go in through October. Replant January through
March.;   (box) Best-bet varieties: (edible pod) Dwarf Gray Sugar and Oregon
Sugar Pod; (garden) Dwarf White Sugar, Honey Pod, Maestro, Rembrandt and
Mammoth Melting Sugar.;   (check) HOW TO PLANT: To save space, plant in double
rows three inches apart with 2 1/2 to three feet of space between double rows.
Plant seeds two inches apart. Tall varieties will need support for climbing.
Tall peas cling weakly and will need frequent tying up.;    Spinach, chard;
Spinach is a fast-growing, short-lived plant that quickly goes to seed in warm
weather. Plant any of the large-leaf kind from seed from September through
April. Swiss chard is treated like spinach in the garden, but isn't as fussy
about weather or soil. It produces heavily.;   (box)  Best-bet varieties: For
spinach: American, Bloomsdale Longstanding and Giant Nobel. Use New Zealand
spinach as a summer substitute; it withstands hot weather. For chard, try
Rhubarb and Fordhook Giant.;   (check) HOW TO PLANT: Plant at three- to
four-week intervals September through April. Sow seeds a half-inch deep; thin
to eight inches apart. Nip off the outer leaves; leave center section to form
new leaves. At the first sign of flower buds forming in the center of a
spinach plant, harvest the entire crop rather than let the spinach set seeds.
Chard can be planted the same way, or you can broadcast chard seeds.;    Root
crops; All root crops do well in winter gardens -- carrots, radishes, beets
and turnips. The trick with root crops is to use deep, well-worked, loose
soil. Once the seeds are started, don't transplant because crooked roots may
result.;   (box) Best-bet varieties: (beets) Detroit Red, Albina Verduna,
Chioggia, Replata, Dwergina,  Golden; (carrots) Chantennay, Danvers, Nantes
French Fingerling, A-Plus 284,  Paris Market, Lindoro 5570,  Kundulus;
(radishes) any variety; (turnips) White Lady, Scarlet Queen, Market Express.; 
 (check) HOW TO PLANT: In rows one foot apart, plant seeds thinly and evenly
and cover with a half-inch of fine soil. Thin carrot seedlings to stand three
inches apart. Beets should be three to four inches apart. Radishes need one or
more inches between plants.; Garlic, onions; These two are prolific in Bay
Area gardens. Plant bunching onions from seed any time; plant onions from sets
(tiny bulbs) October through November and January through March. Plant garlic
from sets October through January.;   (box) Best-bet varieties: (garlic)
California Early, California Late, Elephant; (onions) Early Yellow Globe,
Fiesta Hybrid, Granex, Granal, Grano, Stockton Red, Stockton Yellow Globe,
White Sweet Spanish, Yellow Sweet Spanish.;   (check) HOW TO PLANT: Plant
single cloves of garlic or onion sets about 3 inches apart just below the
surface of the soil in raised beds 6 to 8 inches high. Fertilize and keep the
bed moist. Water once a week if it doesn't rain. As they approach maturity,
stop watering and allow the soil to dry out for harvest. Garlic and onions are
ready to harvest when tops become dry and bend to the ground.; IF YOU'RE
