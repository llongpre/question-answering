<TEXT>  BEST BUY; Get going with seeds; Check seed racks for favorite varieties of
vegetables and flowers, and start them indoors right away. They will need four
to six weeks of growing time indoors before transplanting outdoors. Choose
fast-maturing varieties that grow on compact plants. They use less water. Most
seeds are priced from 85 cents to $1.50.; YOUR CHECKLIST; Use plastic trash
cans to catch rain water running off your roof. Rain water is especially good
for watering indoor houseplants.; (box) Use a spray control for aphids.
They'll soon be munching new growth on your roses.; (box) Apply a weed killer
on the lawn now for crabgrass control, then follow up with a light feeding of
a slow-release fertilizer. When water rationing is in effect, you'll want a
lawn with a healthy root zone without excessive growth.; (box) Don't dig in
the yard when the soil is wet. It compacts the soil.; LAST WORD; All about
gray water; Want to know more about using gray water safely? Robert Kourik
will give a talk on that topic Saturday at 11 a.m. at Saratoga Horticultural
Foundation's spring fair. Kourik wrote "Gray Water Use in the Landscape," a
manual on how to recycle used water. The spring fair will be held at the
Saratoga Horticultural Foundation, 15185 Murphy Ave., off Tennant, San Martin,
from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Speakers, demonstrations, plant sale and tour are
included in the day's event. Information: (408) 779-3303.  </TEXT>
