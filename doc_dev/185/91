<LEADPARA>  WHEN the Santa Clara County Fair got its start 47 years ago, most neighbors in
this agricultural valley shared a bond that was as plain and strong as dirt
itself. After all, their fortunes were tied to the same soil, the same water
and the same weather. But something was lost on the short road from canneries
to computers.;    Today, a guy making silicon widgets has more in common with
his competitor in Singapore than he does with his neighbor across the road. If
he even knows the neighbor across the road.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Which is precisely why we still need the county fair. It's through the
rediscovery of simple pleasures such as apple fritters and Ferris wheels that
we may ultimately find the things we still have in common.;    A county fair
is an egalitarian exercise. We go through that turnstile as equals, visitors
in a temporary city where achievement is recognized with tangible rewards and
status is earned through hog-calling, prune pit-spitting and cabbage-raising.
On the midway, a stuffed bear is not merely a stuffed bear but a symbol that
one has proven one's mettle in the field of Skee-ball. In the Sheep and Swine
Pavilion, a blue ribbon is proof one has raised not just a pig but a superior
specimen that embodies the very best values of the porcine world -- as E.B.
White put it, some pig.;    A hundred years ago, practical skills -- quilting,
canning -- were not trivial pastimes. If you wanted to be warm and well-fed,
you got with the program. Today, we are mildly envious of those who have the
time to master the mechanics of Mason jars and goat milking. They are people
who have rejected the superficiality of pre-fab consumer culture and taken
things into their own hands.;    In an age in which holidays from Thanksgiving
and Columbus Day to Labor Day and the Fourth of July have become lightning
rods for political dissent, a county fair is the most innocent of our annual
rites, unsullied by sectarian strife. Is it possible that anyone (except a
militant dietitian) can be offended by corn-dogs and cotton candy?;    Indeed,
a county fair is an open invitation for each of us to be some pig. There is no
social stigma surrounding gluttony at the fair. Just the opposite. To mow down
a Falstaffian regimen of corn on the cob, calamari, frog legs and frosty cones
is to distinguish oneself as a fair-goer with an appetite for life itself.
Carpe diem and pass the chili dogs, please.;    A county fair is not the place
to shrink away from the coarser pleasures in life. The destruction derby and
Monster Truck Madness are to be embraced with all the
hey-good-buddy-kiss-your-doors-goodbye gusto with which they are presented. We
must leave our tender sensibilities at the grandstand gate and let our
repressed, biggest-Tonka-Toy-in-the-sandbox instincts be played out
vicariously. Anyone who has ever been cut off by a battered Dodge Dart
straining to do 30 on the freeway can appreciate the beauty and dynamism of
the Bubba's-Auto-Part pas de deux.;    A county fair is a place for romance.
In this mini-metropolis that's doomed to fold its tents and vanish in a matter
of weeks, young love takes on an almost Casablancan urgency. Young hearts are
broken and mended between the horse-shoe pits and the Hereford pens. Entire
relationships run their fleeting course in the time it takes to ride the
Tilt-o-Whirl and the Zipper. For every flirtation that is rebuffed, there are
a dozen more new liaisons waiting on the other side of the midway. A person
who has been kissed on a Ferris wheel -- while the fireworks explode in the
distance and the kids in the next seat rain Sno-cones on the crowd -- is a
rich soul indeed.;    Above all, a county fair is a place for children. Let
the adults pretend to understand the intricacies of 18-way kitchen helpers and
parimutuel satellite wagering. It takes a child to see something new in the
artistry of Buzzie the Clown. And it takes a child to see what's so special
about a Duroc swine or a dairy goat.;    You were once of an age where you
could see these simple pleasures. And if you're very lucky at the county fair,
maybe for just a few hours you'll be able to see them again.  </TEXT>
