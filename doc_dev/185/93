<TEXT>     Heart illness, however, had not prevented Mr. Goncalves from continuing to
participate in the family sausage-making business that he established in a
1,000-square-foot shop in 1948.;    As recently as a month ago, he was still
coming in daily to what had grown to a 14-employee, 15,000-square-foot factory
annually producing close to a million pounds of linguica, Italian sausage,
Spanish chorizo and other European sausages, said his grandson, Ed Costa, now
company president.;    In its third generation, Neto is still a family affair.
Another grandchild, Mary Harp, runs the delicatessen at the front of the
factory and also the firm's catering business. Her brother-in-law, Everist
Romano, is the office manager. Beatrice Costa still works in the deli, too,
and has from the beginning 43 years ago.;    Mr. Goncalves worked his way up
to sausage-making. The son of a border guard in northern Portugal, he
immigrated to America to find opportunity when he was 18. He worked in the
coal mines in Pennsylvania, in New York City restaurants as a bus boy, and
finally for an East Coast sausage-making firm. Neto Sausage Co. came to life
shortly after he arrived in California in 1947.;    In his four decades as a
businessman, Mr. Goncalves was well-recognized among the estimated 100,000
Portuguese-Americans in the valley.;    "He was definitely one of the most
well-known Portuguese-Americans in the area," said Antonio Bettencourt,
Portuguese vice consul in San Francisco.;    Mr. Goncalves was a director of
the UPEC, a 12,600-member Portuguese fraternal benefit society in California
and Nevada, and he was elected Fraternalist of the Year by the California
Fraternal Congress, which comprises 40 such organizations, said Carlos
Almeida, UPEC's supreme secretary-treasurer.;    And "he always had an open
heart," Almeida said. "Mr. Linguica was always promoting his product. He made
sure we would always have a spread of sausage for our meetings.";    Although
Mr. Goncalves had officially retired 23 years ago, he was still making the
firm's deposits every day at the Washington Street branch of Wells Fargo bank
in Santa Clara when he turned 90 in May.;    "Arthur would always bring in
candy -- little chocolates fancily wrapped in foil -- from all parts of the
world," said Maureen Sanford, a service specialist at the bank. "He always
said hi to everyone. He was a very sweet man.";    Mr. Goncalves and his wife,
Maria, observed their 64th wedding anniversary in January.; ARTHUR GONcALVES;
