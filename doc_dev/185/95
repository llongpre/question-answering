<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; HIGH-SCHOOL; STUDENT; DEATH; OBITUARY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  One of the last things Franklin Santos did was write a letter to his mother
promising to work harder and be a better student.;    It was enough to
convince her to relent and let him go to the homecoming dance Friday night at
Santa Clara's Wilcox High School. There, doing what folks say he loved best,
the 15-year-old freshman collapsed and died on the dance floor of an apparent
heart attack.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      "I'm glad I let him go," said his mother, Annette Soares, speaking with
pained calm on Monday afternoon. "This is the way it was supposed to happen.
He died dancing and he loved to dance.";   If the coroner finds Franklin died
of a heart attack, he'll be the third generation of his family to die young of
a sudden coronary collapse. His grandfather died of a heart attack at 32, his
father at 33, an aunt and two uncles between the ages of 24 and 31.;  
Schoolwork suffered;   After his father's death six years ago, Franklin felt
he had to be the man of the family, his mother said. His schoolwork slipped,
though he worked hard at drama, his other passion. So getting to the dance
took some extra convincing.;   He wrote to his mother:;   "Mom, if you let me
go to the dance tonight, I, Frank Santos, will promise to keep my grades up. I
will be your slave for as long as you like, I will do all your housework, and
I will feed the dog whenever he needs to be fed.";   "I put myself in his
position, being 15," said Soares. "This was something I couldn't take away
from him. I felt it was a part of his growing up.";   Feared an early death;  
The Santa Clara family had gone through counseling after the father's death
and Soares said her son mentioned the fear "that he wasn't going to live for
very long." His mother tried to discourage such thoughts. A cardiologist had
found both her sons to be in good health and she encouraged Franklin and his
younger brother, Roque, to lead normal lives.;   His mother recalled that
Franklin was wearing his favorite off-white Z. Cavaricci pants, a black shirt
and bolo tie and L.A. Gear high tops Friday night. He didn't take a date to
the dance, choosing to go with a group of his friends.;   "He was so full of
life," she said. "He had patience for everybody else. He never held any
grudges. He had lots of friends.";   Counselors, students meet;   At Wilcox,
in the Santa Clara Unified School District, counselors met with students on
Monday, and friends of Franklin read a memorial to him during the morning
announcements.;   A poster with Franklin's picture was hung on his locker and
the song "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" was dedicated to him over
the public address system. During the day, students wrote cards and letters to
the Soares family.;   Scott Whiting, who directed the high school's recent
production of "The Miracle Worker," recalled Franklin from the crew that
helped construct stage sets and handle the props. Franklin loved drama and was
anxious to learn the craft. He had joked with Whiting at the homecoming game
an hour before the dance, making the director promise him a dancing role in
the upcoming production of "South Pacific.";   'He liked to joke';   "He was
very well-liked. He liked to joke," Whiting said.;   Others, too, remembered
Franklin as well-liked, committed to drama and crazy about dancing, a
teen-ager who was constantly smiling.;   Franklin was a member of City Lights,
a De Anza Bible Church youth group; the Moffett Field-based Civil Air Patrol;
and the Evangel Christian Church Royal Rangers.; (box) Born: May 6, 1976;
