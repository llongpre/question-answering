<LEADPARA>  Ann Anderson of Evergreen was worried that tough economic times would keep
some children in her district from getting toys this holiday season, so with
some help from friends, she has started the first-ever toy drive for needy
children in Evergreen.;   "Knowing it was a recession year, it seemed like
there was more need," said Anderson, who with her husband, Eric, and friend
Charlotte Perez spearheaded the first-ever Evergreen Toy Drive. "And I'm
finding there is a dramatic need."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The group is collecting new and used toys in good condition for Evergreen
children 10 years old and younger. The toys can be dropped off at collection
sites at any of six businesses in the Evergreen area until Dec. 8. To find out
which businesses have collection sites and for any other information, call
(408) 274-5573.;   "We're giving out the toys strictly on a first-call,
first-serve basis," Anderson said. "That was the only way we knew how to do
it." Anderson added that the advantage of a local toy drive is that it will
benefit children in their own community. "So many times you write a check for
a charity and you don't know where it goes," she said.;   Evergreen isn't
alone in answering the need for toys this Christmas. Toys for children of all
ages also can be donated at one of many Toys for Tots collection sites in
businesses all over the county. The Toys for Tots program, sponsored by the
Marine Corps Reserve, is in its 44th year nationwide, according to 1st Sgt.
Len Remour, Toys for Tots coordinator for Santa Clara County.;   This year
Remour hopes to collect about 40,000 toys by Dec. 20.;   "We expect about as
many requests as we had last year," Remour said.;   The Marines collected
about 35,000 toys in 1990, 5,000 fewer than the requests they received.;  
Besides collection sites at businesses, toys can be dropped off at all San
Jose fire departments and at the Marine Corps Reserve center at 901 E. Mission
St. in San Jose.;   Toys should be new, unwrapped and in any price range. The
toys will be distributed to infants and children up to about 12 years old in
the Santa Clara Valley though social service organizations, churches and other
organizations.;   Needy families in the county will also receive food this
year through some local agencies, who are concerned about the effect the
economy will have on giving and receiving.;   "I'm not sure why, but this year
we don't have the high call we usually do for food for destitute families,"
said Bob Tiedemann, chairman of the 39th annual Jack Emery Food Drive
sponsored by the San Jose East Valley Lions Club. "What we do have this year
are middle class families in need because of unemployment.";   Tiedemann
speculated that the need may increase this year as a result, but that "we may
have higher demand and be less able to give.";   Earlier this month the Lions
Club kicked off the food drive, which will continue until Dec. 20. Canned food
and dry goods without expiration dates can be donated at any one of the
collection sites, which include all of the high schools in the East Side Union
High School District and the elementary schools in the Alum Rock Union, Mount
Pleasant, Franklin McKinley, Evergreen, Orchard and Oak Grove school
districts.;   On Dec. 21, the donated food will be divided into 25-pound boxes
to be delivered to needy families on the east side who have been referred by
nurses and health care workers in district schools.;   Tiedemann said the
Lions' goal this year is to help 500 families in the area.;   Another agency
in need of donated food is the Salvation Army, which plans a Thanksgiving
dinner Friday for the homeless. Food for the dinner, such as dressing mix and
fresh vegetables can be donated at the Salvation Army's San Jose Corps
Community Center, 359 N. 4th St., where the dinner will take place. Volunteers
who would like to help with the dinner can call the corps office at 998-4400.;
