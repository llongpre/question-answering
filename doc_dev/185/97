<LEADPARA>  Frank Andrew Cracolice was the youngest of San Jose's four Cracolice brothers.

<TEXT>     But Frank "borrowed" his brother Sal's trumpet, said his godson and nephew,
Frank Albert Cracolice. Then he went off and played in a dance band that
toured the United States several times in the 1930s.;    After Army service
during World War II, he returned to San Jose and opened a tavern on 13th
Street near Taylor and later on old Almaden Road.;    There was the Club
Casanova, and then Topsy's Inn and Frank's Place. "Every time business got
bad, he changed the name," said his daughter, Barbara Sans.;    "My dad (Tony)
said he used to paint signs for Uncle Frankie, but never got paid," said his
nephew.;    About a dozen years ago, Frank Cracolice retired and moved to
Stockton to garden and fish the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta for catfish
and crappie.;    Sans remembers well how much her father loved to fish: "When
I was a kid, we'd have to be out there by 4 a.m. freezing in the fog --
couldn't say a word.;    "I'd complain, 'How am I going to scare the fish?'
He'd just say, 'Don't move.' ";    But you can do just so much fishing and
gardening, said his nephew, and Mr. Cracolice went to work part time for the
state Economic Development Department in Lodi.;    "He'd spend four hours a
day finding jobs for other seniors," said his daughter.;    Then Mr. Cracolice
fell and broke his arm. When it wouldn't heal, doctors ran tests and found
cancer. Mr. Cracolice died Sunday in a Stockton hospital. He was 79.; FRANK A.
