   A Rotary Club chapter has made its own AIDS
documentary for distribution to 24,000 chapters worldwide that
chronicles the lives of three Rotarians affected by the deadly
disease.
   ``Our idea is to change the attitude in Wichita, Kansas,'' said
Dick Hasenpflug, chairman of the Rotary AIDS Project of the Los
Altos Rotary Club.
   Dushan Angius challenged the Rotary Club to get involved in AIDS
education last summer when he told the group his son, Steve, had
AIDS.
   ``When a son tells you he has AIDS, all you hear is `Gee Dad,
I'm going to die.' There's no way I could let it go that way,''
Angius said.
   The documentary, scheduled to be shown to the media today,
eventually will be distributed to 24,000 Rotary Clubs worldwide,
Hasenpflug said.
   ``Rotarians around the world tend to be leaders in their
communities and we think the Rotarian network gives a unique
opportunity to make an impact on community thinking,'' he said.
   The film initially was going to feature Steve Angius's story
alone. But as word of the project spread, two Rotary Club members
publicly acknowledged that they tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   Greg Betts, president of the Bayshore Rotary Club in neighboring
Palo Alto, volunteered to appear in the film.
   Walter Singer, a 67-year-old retired businessman, went one step
further. He allowed crews to film the meeting in December when he
told the Los Altos Rotary Club how he contracted the AIDS virus in
a blood transfusion during heart bypass surgery.
   ``It was an individual reaction, sort of a gasp,'' Hasenpflug
said. ``It was dead silent, a lot of hugging and holding. All of
these things you don't expect a lot of 60-year-old men to be
doing.''
   Singer said the courage of the Angius family and the public
support they received persuaded him to go public.
   ``The Rotarians are not exempt, which they thought they were,''
Singer said.
   The local Rotary Club's involvement with AIDS is a departure for
the conservative organization that usually avoids politically
controversial subjects, Hasenpflug said.
   ``We believe strongly that the AIDS project transcends
politics,'' Hasenpflug said. ``The political part of it is how
people catch it, and in my opinion, how people catch it is
irrelevant once they catch it. People need our support.''
   Hasenpflug describes the film as ``a very powerful piece'' that
avoids presenting facts about the disease and instead focuses on
the impact AIDS has on individuals.
   On the first day of shooting, crews filmed Steve Angius asking
his family to take him to the hospital. He died the next day, Nov.
25.
   ``Grown men cry when they watch this thing,'' Hasenpflug said.
