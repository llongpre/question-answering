<LEADPARA>  Life is a blur for Kimberly's parents. Days run into nights and back into days
again as they rush to give her medications on time, check IV tubes and calm
their chronically ill child.;    "You get to the point that you don't even
know who you are, where you are or whether it's night or day," Robert Statham
said.  </LEADPARA>

CARING FOR 'SPECIAL' KIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But now there's Rotary House, which opened this spring as the nation's
first hospice offering overnight and around-the-clock relief for weary
care-givers.;    Its aim is to reduce the risk of physical, mental or
emotional burnout for people like Robert and Janice Statham. Their 2-year-old
daughter requires constant attention because she has a severe metabolic
disorder.;    "There's tremendous stress on the family unit," said Barbara
Duffy, vice president of Valley Children's Hospital where Rotary House is
located.;    The never-ending demands and tension cause some families to break
up and some to abuse the sick child, she added.;    "We hope to be preventive;
That's what we're all about," Duffy said. "If they can have a week every so
often, or a couple of days, and become refreshed, then that child gets better
care at home.";    Parents or care-givers can use Rotary House up to 30 times
a year, leaving children for a minimum of eight hours and a maximum of seven
days at a time.;    Even with $220,000 seed money from Rotary Clubs, it costs
about $400 a day for respite care, which provides two nurses at all times and
other professional staff as needed. If parents cannot afford that much,
directors will try to work out a price they can pay.;    The atmosphere at
Rotary House is part of the process of easing stress.;    Plants and clay
animal figurines sit on the fireplace mantel of the cheery three-bedroom
house. The couches and easy chairs in the living room and the lawn in front
make people feel as if they're stopping by to see friends.;    "There's
absolutely nothing here that makes them think 'hospital,' and that's good,"
director Cindy Guertin said.;    Guertin tells of one woman who cares for her
16-year-old son at home and went without a vacation for 11 years. This year,
she had a full seven days off thanks to Rotary House and its trained staff.  </TEXT>
