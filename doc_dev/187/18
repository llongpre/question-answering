   American manufacturers of products ranging from
lawn mowers to wine coolers are being hit by extra costs due to
efforts in western Europe to create a single market among 12
countries, the U.S. Commerce Department reported.
   The department is distributing an analysis of 66 directives
proposed or adopted in the European Economic Community as part of
the plan to break down barriers to internal trade by 1992. Nearly
300 directives are included in the program.
   ``The Commerce Department believes that the completion of the
internal market should benefit U.S. companies doing business in
Europe,'' it said. ``However, there is a danger if the 1992 program
is implemented in less than open fashion.''
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills already has complained
about a proposal to guarantee a proportion of television time for
programs produced in Europe. That would limit the number of American
programs that could be used. U.S. officials call this a ``local
content'' requirement, to which free traders object on principle.
   Jacques Delors, the head of the Community's joint executive, was
in Washington last week explaining to President Bush and others the
French view that this is a cultural matter, not a trade matter.
   Community officials and their American critics are giving major
attention to the setting of European standards for industrial
products. Products that meet these standards will be freely saleable
in the 12 countries. Those that do not meet them, will not.
   U.S. companies want to take part in setting the standards. The
Europeans say that only American companies with subsidiaries in
Europe can do that. More talks are scheduled between U.S. and
European officials on this point, but some directives have already
been adopted.
   Take lawn mowers. A directive that goes into effect July 1, 1991,
limits the noise that can be made by motorized cylinder lawn mowers.
A rule in effect since 1987 has made U.S. manufacturers of rotary
lawn mowers either lower the speed of their equipment or redesign
the engines. Sales have not been hit _ U.S. exports of rotary lawn
mowers to the 12 countries went up 221 percent between 1986 and 1988.
   But the Commerce Department said lower speeds could hurt the
performance of American mowers and redesigning engines could bring
increased costs.
   Or take wine coolers. On Jan. 1, the 12 countries banned the use
of the 11.5 ounce bottle current in the United States, the report
said. The Community wants a bottle containing 14 ounces.
   ``The ... bottle would be either too fat or too tall for existing
U.S. production lines ...,'' the report complained. ``The U.S.
bottler would incur the added cost of changing production lines and
maintaining an inventory of another size bottle.''
   The report said the European directives also have or would affect
telecommunications, auto production and forklift manufacturers.
