SMART and luxurious estates have become an attractive alternative to
executive saloons. None comes smarter than the BMW 5-Series Touring, which
arrives in Britain next week.
BMW still cannot quite bring itself to call the Touring an estate car lest
it detract from the marque's sporting image, but that is exactly what it is.
The tailgate lifts to reveal a carpeted space that takes a couple of golf
bags and trollies with the rear seat in use, and something as awkward as a
large rotary mower with the seat down.
As the sill is wide, low and - unlike the 3-Series Touring - unobstructed by
rear light clusters, humping such things on board is not difficult. Four
retractable tying-down points come in handy when carrying things likely to
move around on their own.
It is not even necessary to raise the tailgate to get at the load space. If
you only want to drop in, say, some shopping, the rear window hinges up on
its own. Naturally, a sliding blind conceals from thieves what is put in the
load compartment. Removing the complete blind and roller, or lowering the
rear seat backs complete with headrests, is a one-handed job using touch
buttons.
In every way it is an urbane and civilised car. Unless you turn round and
take a look, you would not realise it was an estate, not a saloon. It feels
rock-solid on rough roads. Regardless of engine speed, there is no body
boom.
At present, two engines are offered: 2.0-litre or 2.5-litre, 24-valve
straight sixes with power outputs of 150 and 192 horsepower respectively.
These engines, introduced for BMW saloons 18 months ago, should return at
least 28 mpg (10.1 l/100km) in normal use and give a gentle driver more than
30 mpg (9.4 l/100km) on a journey.
They are said to cut servicing costs by nearly a quarter compared with the
old 12-valve units. Within a year, there will be 2.5-litre turbo-diesel
option.
A five-speed manual gearbox is standard with automatic transmission (also
five-speed) a desirable (if costly) Pounds 1,150 optional extra. BMW claims
the two-pedal cars have much the same consumption as those with manual
gears.
The 520i Touring I am now driving is everything you would expect a BMW to
be. The engine pulls silkily in high gear at low revolutions, and hums
sweetly at 5,000 rpm-plus in the gears.
As the Touring is significantly heavier than the saloon, standing-start
acceleration is adequate rather than kick-in-the-back. The 2.5-litre version
is, of course, more urgent. But providing you are willing to drop down into
fourth or third when necessary, the 2.0-litre car is a vigorous and refined
performer on a cross-country journey.
Every 5-Series Touring comes with ABS brakes, power steering, central
locking (with deadlocks on all doors), electric windows and door mirrors,
and a two-section powered sun roof.
Buyers of the priciest 520i and 525i SE (for special equipment) models can
delete the sun roof and, for only Pounds 350 extra, have air-conditioning
instead. This sensible option is not available on the cheaper ones. I think
it should be.
BMW GB reckons it will sell about 2,600 of the 5-Series Touring estates this
year at prices ranging from Pounds 20,950 for a manual 520i to Pounds 28,100
for a 525i SE automatic. Four-wheel drive versions - the first BMW has made
with right-hand steering - join the range in June.
They will have 2.5-litre engines and prices are expected to be in the Pounds
28,000 to Pounds 30,300 brackets.
What will the 5-Series Tourings be up against? Not just the market-leading
Volvos and the Audi 100, Citroen XM and Mercedes 200-300 estates you might
expect but also large hatchbacks (Granada/Scorpio, Rover 800 Vitesse and the
new Renault Safrane, for example). It will compete on price rather than
sheer carrying capacity; as a bulk carrier, a 5-Series Touring is no match
for the really big estates.
BMW GB also sees the Touring seducing some owners out of their Range Rover,
Shogun, Land Cruiser and Trooper recreational four-wheel drives. With its
up-market looks, a BMW 5-Series Touring has Smith's Lawn and Badminton
written all over it. And, with all-wheel drive, it would not need towing out
of a muddy car park, either.
