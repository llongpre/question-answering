   Felix Wankel, inventor of the rotary
engine, has died in his native country, friends of the motor
designer said Thursday.
   Wankel died on Sunday. He was 86.
   Wankel began work on a rotary engine in 1926, culminating with
production of the new-design motor at the West German NSU Motor
Works in 1957.
   Through the years, Wankel also designed motors for the Japanese
auto companies Mazda and Toyota, said Thomas Burkhardt, a close
friend of the German inventor.
   He also designed engine superchargers, Burkhardt said.
   Wankel's research offices are located in Lindau, on the shores
of Lake Constance in southern West Germany.
   Wankel's wife died in 1978 and they had no children, said
Burkhardt.
