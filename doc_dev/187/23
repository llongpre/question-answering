   Mazda Motor Corp. said Kenichi Yamamoto, its 65-year-old president, has stepped aside for health reasons. 

   Norimasa Furuta, a senior managing director who joined Mazda in 1985 after 29 years with Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, has been named to succeed him. 
Mr. Yamamoto will serve as chairman, which in Mazda and most Japanese companies is the less-powerful position. 

   The company said Mr. Yamamoto has been suffering from a "crick in the back" since July and has been receiving medical treament. 
He made the decision himself, the company said. 
Shuichi Miyakoshi, an analyst with Nikko Research Center, attached little significance to the change. 
"There seems to have been no major blunder in Mr. Yamamoto's mangement," he said. 

   Sixty-year-old Mr. Furuta served in several senior MITI posts before retiring in 1981. 
At Mazda, he has been in charge of business research, and then corporate communications. 
A company statement quoted him as saying the appointment was "a bolt out of the blue." 

   Mr. Yamamoto started at Mazda in 1946 as an auto transmission assembler. 
He later joined the engineering staff and was one of the chief executives in charge of the development of the rotary engine in the 1960s. 
Mr. Yamamoto, who was named president in 1984, has been trying to strengthen Mazda by emphasizing specialty cars. 
He also pushed the company to begin production in the U.S. Mazda produces cars in cooperation with Ford Motor Co.
