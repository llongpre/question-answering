   The sands of the Saudi desert are chewing
through helicopter parts much faster than expected, causing
problems for U.S. anti-tank Apaches and Cobras, Army officers say.
   The helicopters belong to the 24th Mechanized Division's air
brigade of Fort Stewart, Ga., which holds some of the most forward
positions of the growing U.S. force in northeastern Saudi Arabia.
   The helicopter crews have trained in California's Mojave Desert.
But despite similrities in the terrain, the sands of the Mojave
did not scour as the Saudi sand does, officers and maintenance
personnel said.
   The 24th's helicopters include the high-tech AH-64A Apache and
AH-1 Cobra gunships, OH-58 Kiowas used to scout enemy tank
formations; UH-60 Blackhawk and UH-1 Huey transporters and those
fitted for electronic warfare.
   Despite the maintenance burden, at least 70 percent of the
aircraft are operational at any given moment, said the brigade
commander, Col. Burt Tackaberry, 43, of Jacksonville, Fla.
   He said the rate had dipped into the 60 percent range when the
brigade first moved into its desert camp 10 days ago. But he said
it would not go that low again after flying hours were reduced.
   Defense Department ground rules prohibit mentioning exact
numbers or locations.
   Tackaberry said the brigade does not have its full supplies of
spare parts yet, but he was confident it could start fighting a war
if necessary. The U.S. force is facing off Iraqi troops following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
   The colonel said the Apaches have so many backup systems - three
radio systems, for example, and two types of night vision equipment
- that the failure of one would not knock the helicopter out of
combat.
   But desert sand is wearing out the surface of the rotary blades.
Also, fine sand sucked into the hot engines can melt into glass
that chips and ruts internal parts in the turbines.
   Sand clogs the starting valves and it gets between the twin
panes of the windshield, reducing visibility.
   ``The sand is at work and so are we,'' said Warrant Officer
Richard L. Paradis, 38, of Pooler, Ga., a member of one of the
brigade's two maintenance teams.
   ``We go through a lot of main rotor blades, a lot of tail
blades,'' he said. ``In the desert, we're using about five times as
much.''
   The main engines have to be pulled and cleaned after every 250
hours of flying time, something that does not happen under usual
conditions.
   Staving off wear and tear on the machines requires all sorts of
ingenuity.
   Coats of rubbery epoxy paint are to be added to the front edge
rotary blades to slow the corrosion. The maintenance teams are
experimenting with ways of keeping dust out of the engines, such as
fitting the engines with the tough, flat scouring pads used in many
kitchens.
   Navigation is also a problem. The crews who trained in the
Mojave are having to learn from scratch how to navigate in the
featureless terrain south of the border with occupied Kuwait.
   ``Occasionally you see a few dried up lake beds and camel
herds,'' said Capt. Kelly Marunde, 30, head of air traffic control
and the sole female company commander in the aviation brigade.
   ``But the herds move and the sand blows, so you can't really
rely on anything being there the next day.''
