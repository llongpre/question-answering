<LEADPARA>  "Rotary and AIDS: The Los Altos Story," a deeply moving documentary about how
AIDS has affected the suburban town of Los Altos, has won a George Foster
Peabody Broadcasting Award, radio and television's equivalent of a Pulitzer
Prize.;    "I'm very happy," said Walter Singer, one of three Los Altos Rotary
Club members featured in the documentary. "I guess we did something right in
the last year or two."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The documentary captured the moment Singer announced at a Rotary Club
meeting that he had contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion.
Since then, Singer has traveled to Rotary clubs around the country to show
"The Los Altos Story.";    The documentary, written and directed by former NBC
News correspondent Robin Young, was one of 26 television and radio programs to
be honored Thursday for distinguished service.;    The winners were announced
by the Georgia College of Journalism and Mass Communications, which has
administered the Peabody awards for 51 years.;    "The Los Altos Story" began
in 1989, when Los Altos Rotary member Dushan "Dude" Angius approached the club
about doing a five-minute educational film on AIDS after learning that his
son, Steve, had contracted the virus. Filming started on the day Steve died of
complications from AIDS.;    Soon after, Singer announced that he contracted
the disease, and then Greg Betts, a young Rotarian and manager of the Palo
Alto Animal Shelter, let it be known that he, too, had the virus.;    Earlier
this year, the documentary won an ACE award, cable television's equivalent of
an Emmy, in the public affairs special category.;    The Los Altos Rotary Club
now hopes to raise enough money to send the documentary to 25,000 Rotary
Clubs.;    "People do care," said Singer. "Hopefully, I'll be able to educate
all Rotarians about this disease."  </TEXT>
