SECOND cars normally are bought out of taxed income, which makes first cost
a matter of great importance. So, how can you limit the amount of capital
that has to be invested - or borrowed - to buy what is bound to be a
depreciating asset?
If saving pennies is important, it can pay to think foreign - to faraway
places where cars with strange-sounding names are made. Have you, for
example, ever heard of a Kia, Hyundai, Proton or Sao Penza? Possibly not.
But should you be in the market for a brand-new second car, make a note of
the names.
Kia and Hyundai are Korean; Proton is Malaysian; and Sao Penza, despite
sounding like a minor Portugese saint, is South African. Just to complicate
matters further, deep down they have a lot of Japanese in them.
A Kia Pride is really the former Mazda 121 hatchback (which, incidentally,
was sold for some years in the US as a Ford Festiva. The explanation is that
Ford owns a large chunk of Toyo Kogyo, which makes Mazdas).
Both Hyundais and Protons make use of a lot of Mitsubshi technology,
although Hyundai is pioneering new models entirely of its own design. And
the Sao Penza is a born-again, old-model Mazda 323. Oriental provenance
apart, they also have very competitive on-road pricing in common.
A Kia Pride is a tall, thin car of super-mini size with generous head room,
three or five doors, and a choice of 1.1 or 1.3-litre engines. The controls,
including steering, are light, it rides pretty well and it is cheap - about
Pounds 500 cheaper than a comparable Rover Metro, for example. Prices start
at Pounds 5,499 for the four-speed, 1.1-litre three-door, and Pounds 6,899
buys the longer-wheelbase five-door with a 1.3-litre engine and five-speed
gearbox.
Hyundai's entry model is the X2 1.3-litre three-door with a four-speed
gearbox. It costs Pounds 6,498, which makes it more than Pounds 400 cheaper
than the most basic Renault Clio. But if you fancy driving a sporty-looking
two-door, a 1.5-litre, five-speed Hyundai S-Coupe is quite a bargain at
Pounds 9,938. And an up-market Hyundai Lantra 1.6 GLSi saloon, complete with
power steering and four electric windows, costs only Pounds 10,298,
undercutting the cheapest 1.4-litre Rover 400 (without power steering) by
nearly Pounds 500.
Proton 1.3 and 1.5-litre four-door saloons and five-door Aerobacks resemble
closely the Lancers that Mitsubishi stopped making in Japan several years
ago. All have five-speed gearboxes and power steering, standard on the
1.5-litre models, is a Pounds 350 option on all but the basic 1.3 litre.
Prices start at Pounds 6,990 for a four-door, and even a top-model automatic
Proton Aeroback 1.5 is less than Pounds 10,000.
The Sao Penza is a South African-built version of the old Mazda 323 - the
car that was so similar to the last model Ford Escort that it was even sold
as one in some south-east Asian markets. It has a 1.3-litre engine, five
gears, and is equipped simply. Build quality is up to Japanese standards but
the cost is low - Pounds 6,623 for the three-door, Pounds 6,479 for a
five-door.
There are even cheaper new cars. The rear-wheel driven Russian Lada is based
on the Fiat 124 that died in the 1970s. It is unrefined, but owners say it
is reliable, long suffering and easy to service. (You have only to look at
Russian roads to see why these qualities are much admired back home).
A Lada Riva 1.5 four-door at Pounds 3,905 is a lot of car for the money. If
you do not expect too much - and do not plan to change it too soon - it is
likely to prove good value. The much more up-to-date, front-wheel driven
Lada Samara has its rough edges, too, although the engine (1.3 or 1.5) is
quite sweet and seems tireless.
Prices start at Pounds 4,580 for a five-speed 1.3-litre three-door. At that
kind of figure you cannot really complain about heavy brakes and rather
sloppy handling.
I have saved the best until last: the Skoda Favorit. Forget the jokes about
the old rear-engined Lada (sample: what do they call a Skoda Convertible? A
skip). The 1.3-litre Favorit is a smartly-styled, front-wheel driven
five-door hatchback or estate car.
Volkswagen owns Skoda, and it shows in the build quality. But Skoda prices
remain highly competitive, ranging from Pounds 4,849 to Pounds 6,372.
