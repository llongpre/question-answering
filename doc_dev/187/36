   Nearly two weeks after U.S. Rep. Tommy
Robinson defected to the Republicans, a facsimile machine belonging
to the Arkansas Democratic Party was used to publicize a speech he
was to make.
   ``I see a little humor in that,'' Robinson said Wednesday.
   A news release sent by fax to The Associated Press on Monday
said Robinson, identified in the release as a Republican, would
speak Wednesday at the West Little Rock Rotary Club.
   It said reporters could contact Kip Blakely for more information
and gave a telephone number.
   The number was for the headquarters of the state Democratic
Party, where Blakely is executive director. He is also in charge of
Rotary Club publicity.
   Blakely confirmed Wednesday that he sent the release.
   ``It really is a real deal. It did come from us. I'm a member of
that club and on the board and one of my responsibilities is
advising the press. We asked Congressman Robinson about three
months ago to come and speak to us,'' Blakely said.
   Robinson switched from Democrat to Republican on July 28, saying
he was no longer comfortable as a conservative southerner in his
old party.
   Blakely said he saw no problem with using a Democratic Party fax
machine to get news coverage for a Republican, and said he uses the
machine to relay weekly releases about the Rotary Club's guest
speakers to newsrooms in Little Rock.
   ``It was not like it was long distance,'' Blakely said, adding
that there was no cost to the party for the local call.
   ``Certainly I appreciate the free publicity,'' Robinson said,
``but I don't know if that will put him in good standing with the
Democrats. I think it's a very kind gesture on their part to let
people know about my speech by way of their fax machine.''
   ``I like Kip Blakely and I don't have anything against Arkansas
Democrats. One day they will make the same decision I have made,''
Robinson said Wednesday.
   Blakely was joshed by Ken Coon, chairman of the Arkansas
Republican Party.
   ``We make mistakes ourselves sometimes. I guess Kip secretly
wants to change,'' Coon said with a laugh Wednesday. ``I appreciate
the publicity. We need all the help we can get.''
   Blakely said he joked about Robinson during last week's Rotary
meeting. ``Tongue in cheek, I stood up and asked Mr. President
whether it would be the honorable thing for the congressman to
address us since we scheduled him when he was with one party and
switched to another,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Robinson was introduced to a meeting of civic clubs
at Benton as: ``A Democrat, Tommy Robinson ...''
   The man giving the introduction said the information came
directly from a biography supplied by Robinson's office.
   Robinson replied with a grin: ``I will check with my staff when
I get back to the office this afternoon about the bio they sent
out.''
