<HEAD>Company Replaces Push-Button Phones With Rotary Dials to Fight
Drugs</HEAD>

   A telephone company is taking a
technological leap backward in an effort to fight the drug problem.
   U S West has replaced push-button pay phones with rotary models
at about 18 Twin Cities locations to make it harder for drug
dealers to conduct business with telephone pagers, U S West
spokesman Mike Breda said.
   Because most pagers don't work unless the call comes from a
push-button phone, drug dealers with pagers can't use the rotary
phones.
   Pagers have become a way of life for dealers, who often fear
their telephone lines are tapped.
   ``Everybody's got them,'' Lt. James Singer of the St. Paul
police narcotics unit said of the pagers.
   Customers order drugs by telephoning a dealer's pager and then
punching in a phone number or a pre-arranged code, police say. The
dealer responds by calling back or showing up with the drugs.
   In the past, Minneapolis and St. Paul police regularly asked the
telephone company to remove pay phones in drug-infested areas or to
adjust the phones so they don't accept incoming calls. But removing
public phones can hurt people who can't afford private telephones.
   ``We have noticed a decrease in traffic in at least a couple of
locations where we changed the phones,'' said Minneapolis Council
member Jackie Cherryhomes. ``I don't think it is going to win the
battle against drugs, but if you can affect it in any way, that's
important.''
   However, U S West's tactic may not work for long. At least one
paging company now offers a pager in which the caller can use any
phone.
   At least one paging company has taken steps to try to halt the
use of pagers for illegal purposes, said Steven Miorana, general
manager of MinnComm Paging in Minneapolis.
   A typical drug dealer will receive more than 1,000 pages per
month, he said. MinnComm now charges an extra 20 cents per call
after 500 calls to discourage excessive use, he said.
