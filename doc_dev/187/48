   Mazda Motor Corp.'s new two-seat
convertible is being billed as a sports car for the masses.
   The Japanese automaker introduced the car Thursday, saying its
base price of $13,800 leaves it alone in a segment of the market
that had been populated by the Pontiac Fiero and other cars not so
long ago.
   Mazda is counting on consumers to make the distinction between a
sports car, which its new Miata MX-5 is, and a ``sporty'' car, like
the RX-7 or Nissan's 300ZX or 200SX.
   ``It's our belief that many of those sporty-car buyers would like
a sports car,'' said George McCabe, vice president for sales of
Mazda Motor of America Inc. ``It's a sports car for the masses.''
   Prices for ``sporty'' cars have been pushed into the $20,000
range because of currency exchange rates and the addition of an
array of electronic gadgetry, leaving a gap in the market at the
lower end.
   Options on the Miata could push it into the $16,000 range,
officials said.
   Mazda began full-scale development of a two-seat car without a
lot of the electronic additions on the more-expensive models in
1986. Development costs were held to a modest $100 million because
it shares some features with the Mazda 323.
   Mazda plans limited production of the car. The company expects to
sell about 20,000 during the last half of this year and twice that
many during 1990. The assembly plant in Japan has a
60,000-car-a-year capacity.
   For now, the car is being marketed only in the United States,
with distribution in Japan and Europe possible next year, officials
said.
   The rear-wheel-drive car carries a 116-horsepower, four-cylinder,
1.6-liter engine. And that could pose a problem with insurance
companies, officials said.
   ``It's true that insurance has really impacted the sports car
category in the last couple of years,'' McCabe said at a news
conference. ``We don't expect the insurance companies will view the
Miata in a negative light.''
