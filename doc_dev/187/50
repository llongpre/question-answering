SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;

<P>
NEW FUND TO HELP NEEDY YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In memory of Patrick Cragin, the Fleming Junior High School principal who died 
last month, the Lomita-Torrance Airport Rotary Club has established a Memorial 
Youth Fund to aid needy children in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Money from the fund will be used to help finance some of the club's existing 
youth programs, as well as to start new youth-related projects, said Kendrick 
Ching, president-elect of the club. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Cragin, 48, who was principal at Fleming for two 
years, was working with law enforcement and city officials in the South Bay to 
organize sports and educational activities to keep children off the street, 
Ching said. The fund in his honor will be used to continue such activities for 
children between the ages of 10 and 16, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The club has already received about $2,000 in donations, Ching said. Anyone 
wishing to make a donation or propose a new youth program should contact the 
Lomita Rotary Club, PO Box 578, Lomita, 90717.
