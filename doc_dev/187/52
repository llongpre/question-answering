   For 11 years, Walter Singer has been
playing Santa, but he doesn't fill the red suit out as well as he
used to _ he's lost 18 pounds since testing positive for the AIDS
virus.
   ``It's not just gays or people sharing needles who get this
disease,'' said Singer, whose year-round civic generosity has
earned him the title ``unofficial mayor for life.''
   ``Anyone can get it, even Santa.''
   Singer, a retired businessman infected during a blood
transfusion, began taking the drug AZT last May.
   He has suffered fatigue and loss of appetite and dropped in
weight from 183 pounds to 165. But he enjoyed riding on a float as
Santa in the town's Festival of Lights parade after Thanksgiving
and he plans to don the red suit and white whiskers again next year.
   Singer went public at a Rotary Club meeting last week, hoping to
call attention to the disease. He is one of the subjects of a
videotape about AIDS to be shown to 1 million Rotary members.
   Singer, a genuinely jolly man, won't wallow in self-pity. His
style is to do something about a problem. He's known his share of
tragedy, but says he's been pretty lucky, too, and wants to help
when he can.
   Fifty years ago, at 15, Singer fled Nazi Germany with his mother
and stepfather and settled in San Francisco. His father later died
in a concentration camp.
   He says he learned about the American way of life and
voluntarism when he spent about a year and a half with a couple who
took in refugees in the Los Altos Hills, 45 miles south of San
Francisco.
   After high school, he joined the Army and spent most of World
War II taking care of German prisoners of war. After the war, he
served 20 years in the reserves.
   ``I felt I had an obligation to do something for my new
country,'' he said.
   He and his wife, Marie, had a son, Mark, now 32, and a daughter
who died.
   Singer worked as an art supply salesman, then opened his own
stationery store in 1976. And he stayed busy with the Rotary and
various civic groups ``to put something back in the town.''
   ``Walter's done virtually everything to help out this city,''
said Mayor Dave Reeder. ``He and his wife are involved in
everything. He is one of those people who has always believed in
and supported the community, and is just a fine person.''
   The community honored him many times, but Singer wasn't into it
for the awards _ he just liked to help. He even came to resemble
the image of St. Nick with his jiggling paunch.
   In 1984, just before he turned 60, Singer suffered a heart
attack and underwent a five-way bypass operation. Afterward, he
bled internally and had to have surgery again.
   ``Somewhere along the line, I got six units of blood. That's
when the little bugaboo happened,'' he said, managing a chuckle at
his bad luck.
   It was early in the AIDS epidemic, and screening for the virus
in blood donors was not so sophisticated or as stringent as it
would be later.
   Last March, Singer got a letter from the hospital, saying he was
one of 8,000 patients who might have been exposed to the virus. In
May, tests identified him as a carrier of the virus.
   ``I'd read about AIDS in the paper,'' he said, ``but I thought,
`This doesn't happen to Walter. It's not a disease a person like me
gets.'''
   Unknown to Singer, the president of his local Rotary Club,
Lucien Angius, was dealing with his own AIDS tragedy. His
32-year-old son in New York told him in January that he had an
advanced case of the disease.
   Angius proposed an educational videotape about AIDS for
Rotarians in July, but Singer still didn't tell anyone about his
own problem except his family.
   Singer retired in October. On Nov. 25, Angius' son died. Last
week, Singer decided to tell his story because he felt it would
make fellow Rotarians aware that they, too, could be stricken.
   The response has been ``nothing but positive phone calls and
cards. So many people I knew, some I didn't know, called. It's been
wonderful.''
   ``I think Walter is a terribly courageous man to bring this out
into the open and help the education process,'' said Reeder. ``It's
a real sad thing, but it's opening up people's eyes to the
problem.''
   Doctors have told Singer he may have two to four more good years
before the AIDS virus begins causing severe problems.
   ``It's not a pleasant way to go,'' Singer said. ``But until
then, I plan a fairly normal way of life. My wife and I want to
travel, see the U.S. I'll still do volunteer work. I plan to keep
busy.
   ``I'll be Santa Claus again next year, and I hope for many
years,'' he said. ``It gives me a lot of satisfaction to be able to
entertain all the children.''
