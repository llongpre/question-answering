<LEADPARA>  KKSF-FM has announced it will donate a portion of the proceeds from the sale
of "Sampler for AIDS Relief" CD and cassette tape sold this weekend at the Los
Altos Arts and Wine Festival to the Los Altos Rotary AIDS Project.;    The
Rotary project produced "The Los Altos Story," a documentary detailing how
acquired immune deficiency syndrome has affected several residents of Los
Altos, including Rotarians Greg Betts and Walter Singer -- known locally as
"Mr. Los Altos." Singer had contracted the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion
he received during a heart bypass operation. The documentary received a
Peabody Award in March.  </LEADPARA>
