   Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan said it is recalling all of its 1986 model RX-7 cars because an improperly routed hose could make it difficult to start the engine when the engine is hot. 

   The company said a total of 50,924 cars are effected by the recall and that the problem usually emerges after the engine has been run for about 45 minutes or more of highway driving. 

   Mazda said the problem is in the emissions system's purge hose, which channels gas vapors into the engine. 

   The company said it knows of no injuries or accidents that have resulted from the improperly routed hoses.
