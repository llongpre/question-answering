market

Are congestion, environmental legislation and associated factors finally
killing off the sports car and romantic notions of the open road?
The new product programmes of some of the world's biggest car makers, and
the resurgent fortunes of some of the smallest, suggest the very opposite.
Porsche, the German luxury sports car maker, itself is now in the middle of
a drastic overhaul, with new management, new methods and an impending new
product range which, it claims, will return it to comfortable profits and
30,000-a-year output within the next four or five years.
If its predictions are borne out, they would reinforce the assertions of
industry analysts that the sales slump was a manufacturer, not a market,
problem, and that despite road congestion and other adverse environmental
and legislative pressures, there will remain enough sports car enthusiasts -
or at least people prepared to pay for 'something different' - to justify
manufacturers of all sizes investing in products for them.
Unlike mainstream sectors such as saloon cars, the 'sports car' market is so
multi-faceted as to defy easy categorisation.
It embraces individual company production levels from a few dozen a year to
approaching 50,000, and prices from under Pounds 10,000 for near-kit cars to
the Pounds 400,000-plus 'supercars' of McLaren and Jaguarsport.
At one end of the spectrum, UK-based Morgan is earning a modest but steady
living from producing around 500 versions a year of a two-seater with its
origins in the 1930s. At the other lies Japan's Mazda, which has almost
single-handedly filled the vacuum left by MG with its 'cheap' - Pounds
16,000 in the UK - MX-5 roadster.
In the US, where MGs were once by far the biggest selling sports car, the
MX-5 has achieved peak sales of 36,000 units in a single year. As with
Porsche, its fall to around 22,000 in the US last year is believed to
reflect more the ageing of the model itself in what is inevitably a
fashion-conscious sector of the market than any weakening of the sports car
market itself.
It is this consumer capriciousness, coupled to the oil crisis and recession
of the early 1980s, which for a long time frightened most Western volume
producers out of the sports car market.
Equally, more manufacturers are taking heart from the belief that there is a
worthwhile market and from advances in simultaneous engineering and other
technologies that favour smaller production runs.
For example, there were the decisions of resurgent Chrysler to put into
production its outrageous, eight-litre, V10-engined Viper open two-seater
sports car and, in the past few weeks, to add a coupe version of the same
model. More than 1,000 Vipers have already been sold, despite a Pounds
55,000 price tag.
The same confidence inspired Ford to invest in a new Mustang which harks
back to the sports car concept of the original 1960s models. Meanwhile,
General Motors' sports car, the Corvette, regularly finds a 20,000-plus
market in the US. A two-seater sports car is to enter production next year
at BMW's 80,000 cars a year plant in Greenville, South Carolina.
Problems of definition blur the size of the sports car market in Europe,
because many manufacturers consider coupes like the Opel/Vauxhall Calibra
and the new Ford Probe as legitimate successors to some of the traditional
open two-seater market.
When these are included, industry monitoring group Automotive Industry Data
suggests, there is an available west European market of between 250,000 and
300,000 units. Certainly it is big enough to tempt back some large
manufacturers who had previously all but abandoned this market. Fiat, which
owns Ferrari, Lancia and Alfa Romeo, is launching a two-pronged attack with
an all-new Fiat coupe and an equally new open two-seater Alfa, the Spyder.
Thanks to new engineering and production technology, financially
hard-pressed Fiat has gone ahead with projected volumes of around 20,000 a
year. Indeed the Fiat coupe, which uses Tipo hatchback floorpan and
mechanicals, is a pet project of Fiat Auto managing director Mr Paolo
Cantarella. It may not make much money in itself, but he expects the glamour
of the sleek two-seater, now on sale to benefit the group's more mundane but
bigger volume models struggling for a bigger share of Europe's mainstream
market.
Similar calculations are evident in other parts of the industry. All last
year General Motors was touting around Europe's motor shows the Tigra, a
small two-seater based heavily on GM's small European hatchback, the
Spanish-built Opel Corsa. If the public liked it, GM promised, the company
would build it. It has now given it the green light.
Perhaps the most eagerly-awaited new sports car of all will emerge in the UK
next year - the first genuinely 'new' MG since the demise of the MGB more
than a decade ago. Rover group, now part of BMW, is taking an unusual route
to market with the range of small MG sports cars it intends to launch in
Europe and Japan in 1995, some 15 years after killing of the 'B' of which
more than 500,000 were produced.
The car's body is being designed, developed and manufactured by Motor
Panels, the Coventry-based subsidiary of the Mayflower engineering group.
Mayflower is investing up to Pounds 24.2m for the initial engineering
design, development and tooling work, including the production facilities
for the body shells.
The two companies expect to share the profits from the project, code-named
PR3. The car will use a 1.6 litre version of Rover's avant garde K-series
engine, cost around Pounds 15,000 and is envisaged to be produced at a rate
of 15,000 to 20,000 a year.
Rover has already paved the way for the MG marque's revival with the launch
last year of the RV8, an updated, limited production version of the MGB
using Rover's V8 engine from the Range Rover.
