FT  07 MAR 92 / Motoring: Japanese invade Geneva - Europe's first big show
of the year

GENEVA'S salon de l'automobile is the first big European motor show of the
year. Switzerland makes virtually no cars of its own and is a completely
free market in which all vehicles compete on level terms. So, a visit to the
show is as good a way as any to take the temperature of the industry. This
year, it is the Japanese who are making the running and most of the news.
Toyota has chosen Geneva for the world premiere of its new Carina E. This is
the car that will start rolling off the assembly tracks next December at the
green-field factory nearing completion at Burnaston, Derbyshire.
The Carina E is a four-door saloon or five-door hatchback, elegantly though
practically aerodynamic, with a choice of 1.6 or two-litre, multi-valve,
four-cylinder petrol engines and a two-litre diesel. It looks rather like
its up-market relatives, the Lexus and Camry.
Toyota says the Carina's 'E' tag stands for 'excellence in Europe' and
stresses that it was created to suit European tastes. It forecasts, almost
certainly correctly, that the car will prove a formidable rival to such
established Euro-favourites as the Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra), Ford
Sierra, Peugeot 405, Rover 200/400 - and that product of the first Japanese
motor industry transplant in Britain, the Nissan Primera.
European buyers will not have to wait for the British-made cars.
Japanese-made Carina Es will start to go on sale from May and prices are
likely to be in the Pounds 11,500-16,000 range. An estate version is in the
pipeline.
Another Japanese world debutant at Geneva is the Honda CRX. This is not just
a Civic-derived sporting hatchback but a completely new vehicle that seems
bound to make its mark in the niche market for open-top fun cars.
Honda says that the CRX is not a backward glance at open sports cars of
bygone days (a dig at the Mazda MX-5) but a technically-innovative package,
although the running gear comes from the latest Civic. Buyers can have
1.6-litre engines of 125 or 160 horsepower, five-speed manual gears or a
four-speed automatic.
The CRX's rigid roof panel lifts off and stows under the boot lid - power
operation will be an optional extra - and the rear window retracts
electrically into a well. It reaches Britain in June, where it is expected
to cost about Pounds 16,000 upwards. By that time, Honda's glamorous new
Prelude 2+2 coupe, seen first at the Tokyo show last October, will have been
on sale in the UK for some weeks.
The 2.2-litre, 160-horsepower Prelude, with electronic four-wheel steering,
handled brilliantly when I tried it on the serpentine minor roads of Spain's
Costa Brava last month. British prices will be Pounds 16,495 for the 2.0,
which has ABS brakes but conventional steering; and Pounds 18,950 for the
4WS, 2.2-litre model which - like the 160 bhp CRX - comes with a driver's
side airbag.
Mazda, which of late has made a speciality of filling market niches with
entertaining cars like the MX-5, MX-3 and, more recently, the MX-6, has
pulled yet another one out of the hat for Geneva. The Xedos 6 (Xedos is the
name by which the poshest Mazda models will be known in future) is pitched
at the sporty saloon sector dominated by BMW, Alfa Romeo, Audi and Lancia.
Britain will have it from early summer with a choice of engines: either a
two-litre, quad-cam V6 or a twin-cam, 1.6-litre, in-line four-cylinder. Like
so many of the latest Japanese cars, the Xedos combines curvaciousness with
good aerodynamics and is almost austerely undecorated.
Although the Japanese makers' presence at Geneva has never been stronger,
European and US makers are not letting them have it all their own way.
Renault is unveiling its Safrane executive-class car to replace the 25.
Although by no means a bad car, the 25 never sold well in Britain; but it
was very popular in France with business motorists and taxi operators who
could not afford a Mercedes.
The Safrane has cross-mounted V6 or in-line four-cylinder engines,
power-adjustable rear seats, and a hard-to-steal CD hi-fi system with remote
control that eventually will be combined with a hands-free mobile telephone.
It comes to Britain in August.
Alfa Romeo is showing the new, front-wheel drive 155, which has some
similarities with the Lancia Dedra under the sheet metal but uses Alfa's own
two-litre Twin Spark four-cylinder engine or a 2.5-litre V6. British sales
start early in summer and a 1.8 Twin Spark joins the range toward the end of
the year.
BMW unveils its new three-litre (218-horsepower) and four-litre (287 bhp) V8
engines. They will start to replace its veteran but silky-smooth in-line
sixes, initially in the 7-Series and then the 5-Series. Citroen's stand
features the first of the ZX models with automatic transmission.
No Geneva salon is complete without novelties, and two eye-catchers are
shown by General Motors. 'Ultralite' is a high-efficiency concept car with -
pedestrians and cyclists beware  - entire body sides opening as a pair of
gull-winged doors.
GM's Opel 'Twin' is a super-mini with interchangeable electric motors and
petrol engines. A rear-mounted drive module contains either a 34-horsepower,
three-cylinder engine or a pair of 14-horsepower electric motors, both with
a transmission and either a petrol tank or battery pack.
The idea is that when internal combustion-engined cars are banned from city
centres, you drive to a GM dealer. He whips out the petrol engine module and
replaces it with a battery-electric - 'just like that,' as the late comedian
Tommy Cooper would have said. And when you leave town to drive home, he
changes it back again. All you do is pay a rental charge.
GM says its engineers have achieved an average 106 mpg (2.66 l/100 km)
consumption with the 800 cc, three-cylinder engine matched with a six-speed
automatic transmission. As a battery car, it is said to use only 11.5
kilowatt-hours of energy every 100 km (62 miles). The show exhibit is not a
runner but GM plans to build one if public response justifies.
Ford's Ghia Connecta electric car uses technology from the Ecostar delivery
van. A fleet of 100 Ecostars goes into experimental service with customers
in Britain and the US next year.
It is, however, hard to see interesting concepts like the Connecta - even
more so, the GM Twin - ever getting beyond the prototype stage unless two
things happen. High-efficiency batteries must become much cheaper and the
law must allow only zero-pollution cars in urban areas.
