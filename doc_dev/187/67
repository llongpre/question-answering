   Mazda Motor Corp. on Tuesday introduced
three new 1990-model cars, two of them subcompacts, and unveiled an
advertising campaign aimed at making the Japanese automaker's name
more recognizable to U.S. buyers.
   The new models include the 929 S, which basically is the same as
Mazda's flagship 929 sedan but with a 190 horsepower engine,
compared with the 158 horsepower engine in the standard 929.
   The more powerful engine will add $1,500 to the 929 base price of
$23,300. The 929's base price for 1989 is $20,900.
   Mazda also introduced two new subcompacts, a restyled 323
Hatchback and the 323 Protege sedan. Mazda will keep the 323
designation in front of the Protege for a year then drop it. The 323
Hatchback's base price is $6,599, the same as in 1989, and the
Protege's is $9,339.
   In other product news, Mazda said it was offering a
four-wheel-drive version of its MPV minivan and would begin building
1990 models of its 626 sedan at its plant in Flat Rock, south of
Detroit. Mazda also makes its MX-6 coupe and the Ford Probe at the
plant.
   By the time 626 production at Flat Rock reaches full production
of 54,000 cars a year, that plant will produce most of the 80,000 or
so 626 cars it expects to sell in the United States next year.
   That gives the company more room in its import quota for the
Miata two-seat, convertible sports car, which has met with heavy
demand. The company plans to import 40,000 of the cars a year,
although it doesn't plan to boost availability in the United States.
   Mazda began a new series of brand-identification advertisements
earlier this month and will show off its 1990 cars and trucks in
another series of ads beginning in September, said George McCabe,
deputy general manager and group vice president for sales of Mazda's
U.S. marketing arm.
   ``Compared with Honda and Toyota, Mazda consistently trails in
the areas of brand image and brand familiarity,'' McCabe said. ``Our
image is generally positive, yet it is not nearly as well defined as
Honda's or Toyota's.''
   He said the campaign would focus on a new theme involving the
Japanese concept of ``kansei engineering,'' or incorporating a
driver's five senses into design and engineering of a car.
   The company's new advertising slogan will be ``It just feels
right.''
   Separately, a Mazda executive said the company is exploring
development of a second dealer network to market luxury cars as
Honda Motor Co. has done with Acura.
   This fall, Toyota Motor Corp. will deliver Lexus cars to a second
dealer network and Nissan Motor Corp. plans the same with its
Infiniti line.
   Yoshinori Taura, president of Mazda Motor of America, said his
company is studying what Honda, Toyota and Nissan are doing, but a
target date hasn't been set for deciding whether Mazda would develop
another dealer channel for luxury cars.
