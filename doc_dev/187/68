<LEADPARA>  THEY call them the pocket rockets, stylish little coupes designed for young
drivers who want zip in their engines despite having close to zip in their
bank accounts.;   Honda was first in the field with its peppy CRX. Now, the
Geo Storm is the major seller in what's officially called the entry-level,
upscale coupe segment. Others in the fray are the Toyota Paseo, Nissan NX,
Mitsubishi Eclipse, Saturn SC, Ford Escort GT and Hyundai Scoupe.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Generally speaking, these cars have sporty styling, decent performance and
sell for around $12,000 or less. Carmakers have even included small back
seats, which help young buyers get cheaper insurance.;   Designers at Mazda --
a Japanese car company that's making major inroads plugging niche markets --
have come up with a mini-sports coupe with winning ways. The new MX-3 has a
lot going for it. The styling is superb. The price is right (starting at
$11,000). There's even an optional V-6 engine available.;   Our test vehicle
turned heads. Its exterior styling and tropic emerald metallic paint can be
thanked for that.;   My complaints were mainly minor: a V-6 engine that whines
instead of growls, visibility that suffers in the name of design and motorized
seat belts that annoy.;   We managed to log 358 miles on the MX-3's odometer
in a week despite sandwiching drive time around a three-day, out-of-town trip.
Our top-of-the-line GS model with its V-6 engine had a base price of $13,800
plus an additional $2,700 or so in options. That $16,485 total price tag takes
this vehicle out of range for most young buyers, but they don't need to add
that much "stuff" to get a car that's fun to drive. The MX-3 already comes
that way.;    Here's our report:;   THE RIDE: You can't help but feel that
you're going fast when you're driving the MX-3, even if you're not. The car's
aerodynamic shape and fairly loud engine contribute to this effect. I'd
describe the acceleration as peppy but not powerful. Frankly, I was surprised
that the V-6 engine's 130 horsepower didn't give this car more oomph. The fact
that its 1.8 liter, double-overhead-cam engine is the smallest displacement
V-6 in mass production probably explains the lack of neck-jerking
acceleration.;   As mentioned above, the engine doesn't exactly growl like a
real sports car. All those little parts working really fast tend to make a
higher-pitched whrrr rather than a virile grrr.;   Handling and braking were
good. Rear visibility, however, is fairly marginal despite the large window in
the hatchback. It's angled so severely that there's not much seeing surface.
Rear-seat passengers make visibility even worse.;   (The base model comes with
an 88-horsepower, 1.6-liter, single-overhead-cam, in-line, 4-cylinder
engine.);   THE LOOK: With its low front end and wide-eye oval headlights, the
MX-3 is vaguely Porsche-like in its styling. Its best-in-class looks include
smooth lines and a rounded rear.;   This car catches eyes and turns heads.
Mazda officials say that the "up-and-comers," as they describe MX-3 target
buyers, consider style and image of utmost importance when they make buying
decisions. This car's style and image are top notch.;   INSIDE: The driver and
passenger will be comfortable as soon as they sit down. They will, however,
have to do a little bending and head-tucking to get into the car. The seats
are good. The black and maroon interior of our test vehicle was attractive.
The upholstery is seamless, which gives the rear seat a different look. The
back seat is pretty small and rather unusual with two indentations for
people's bottoms. Head room is a bit scarce, too. Mazda officials call it "an
occasional back seat.";   CONTROLS/GADGETS: The air-conditioning system is
easy to operate, works well and is properly placed. The sound system also is
pretty impressive, but some of the buttons are minute. The speedometer,
located dead-center in the dash, can be hard to see.;   The glove box is
small. The center console is rather flimsy with dual cup holders. It's a
little too far back to be of easy use.;   The hatch is heavy, but it opens to
reveal a decent amount of storage space. The lip is rather high, however, so
you'll need to lift things up and over to get them into the car.;   LAST WORD:
Mazda hopes to sell roughly 35,000 MX-3s in its first year on the market.
That's about how many Miatas Mazda sold in 1990. About 40 percent of MX-3
buyers will opt for the V-6 engine.; Nuts and bolts; What we drove: '92 Mazda

MX-3 is car as cartoon, a comic set of wheels that will attract a loyal
following. Whether that following will be large enough to make the MX-3 a hit
is another matter. Not everyone likes cartoons.;   But folks who are lovers of
the odd and cute will take this compact, four-seat, front-wheel-drive car to
heart. It is odd as heck with its pop-eyed headlamps. It is cute as the
dickens with its grill that resembles parted lips."; Warren Brown,; Washington
Post; (hbox);   "Although the new Mazda MX-3 GS doesn't set the world on fire
with red-hot acceleration, its splendid new V-6 shows us that smoothness and
precision have as much to do with driving enjoyment as out-and-out
acceleration. In essence, the MX-3 is a $15,500 car amongst a bunch of
lesser-refined and perhaps lesser-priced pocket-rockets."; Andrew Bornhop,;
Road &amp; Track; (hbox);   "The MX-3 feels just a little sportier. In person, its
body stocking bulges with more promise. It is low-slung and far more
intriguing than the camera would suggest. None of the bonsai GTs are Elle
McPhersons of the road, mind you, but the MX-3 comes closest."; -- Rich
