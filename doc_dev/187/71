FT  13 JUL 93 / Technology: Drivers on the button - Almost any car could
dispense with its gear lever

It would probably never occur to most drivers of non-automatic cars that
changing gear might be possible by pressing a button instead of having to
reach down and move a lever. Imagine being able to operate the gears as
easily as turning on the lights or windscreen wipers.
The technology is there, but has yet to be put into widely available form.
However, a start is being made by Prodrive, the UK motor sport engineering
concern which prepares some of the world's leading race and rally cars. It
has developed a road-going version of the press-button, semi-automatic
gearboxes hitherto confined to leading grand prix teams and the world
championship rally cars Prodrive operates for Subaru of Japan.
Although the system will make its off-track debut this year in one of
Italy's best-known makes of exotic sports car, it could be added to almost
any car's conventional manual gearbox. 'There is no reason why it should not
be cheaper than, say, power steering,' according to David Lapworth, managing
director of Prodrive's engineering services subsidiary.
In its current road-going form, the system is being tested by Prodrive in a
Subaru Legacy saloon. No modifications have been made to the car's
conventional gearbox. Instead, the normal clutch operating cylinder is
supplemented by an actuating mechanism whose operation is managed by an
electronic control unit (Ecu) and an air tank and small compressors located
remotely - in the Legacy's case, in the boot.
The actuating unit is about a foot long. Along with the valve system it is
small enough to have been installed in the Legacy's transmission tunnel
without modifying the bodywork.
The driver selects gears by touching buttons on the upper and lower surfaces
of the steering wheel. Specific buttons do not select specific gears.
Instead, any button on the upper surface takes the car up a gear, and any
button on the lower surface takes it down. Repeated pressing takes the car
sequentially up or down through the gears.
The clever bit lies in what the Ecu does on receiving a gear change
instruction - relayed electronically - from the driver. For upshifts, the
driver simply presses the button without either lifting his foot from the
accelerator pedal or operating the clutch pedal. The Ecu throttles back the
engine at the same time as ordering the compressor to operate the clutch.
The resultant upshift is as fast as any achievable manually by a Nigel
Mansell or Ayrton Senna.
The principles are the same for downshifts - except that the Ecu prevents
the engine being strained through over-revving, should the driver seek to
change down too early. In this event, the Ecu is capable of both 'blipping'
the accelerator and delaying the clutch operation until gear and engine
speeds are compatible.
What are the benefits? In the area of performance motoring, gears can be
changed with optimum efficiency while preserving maximum control over the
car by keeping both hands on the steering wheel. Clutch wear is also
minimised and manual operation of the clutch is required only when starting
or stopping.
Prodrive's Legacy test model retains both its clutch pedal and the
conventional gear lever - a function of its close kinship to the rally cars,
which can revert to manual clutch and gear changing as a competition 'fail
safe'. On the back roads near Prodrive's Banbury, Oxfordshire, headquarters,
it is disconcerting to have the gearshift seemingly operating itself while
the driver uses the press button system. But, as Lapworth stresses, neither
clutch pedal nor gear lever need be retained for non-sporting applications.
Preoccupation with competition - the bulk of Prodrive's business - meant the
company could not start on a road version until early last year. The
development programme has three phases:
First is the Legacy system, fitted as an aid to enthusiastic driving.
Second is a system which selects the gears itself at the appropriate moment,
depending on accelerator position - in effect a fully automatic gearbox.
This system also allows drive-away from rest.
This second phase still involves adding equipment to existing transmissions,
and would be applicable in areas such as cheaply converting ordinary cars
for use by the disabled.
But the logical final phase, points out Lapworth, would be for car makers to
manufacture gearboxes specially designed for the system. The unit cost of
these could be much lower than for conventional manual gearboxes because -
thanks to the 'autoshift' ensuring that gear and engine speeds are
compatible during changes - synchromesh and all its complicated cones and
other components could be dispensed with.
There are rival transmissions, however, which their proponents might argue
are a still more sophisticated answer to the average motorist's needs. Chief
among these is the continuously variable transmission (CVT). Already fitted
to some Ford, Fiat, Volvo, Rover Group and even Subaru models, the CVT
provides an infinitely variable number of gear ratios by means of steel
drive belts working around expandable pullers.
The theory of the CVT is that the driver depresses the accelerator according
to whether he wants maximum or mild acceleration, or a high or low cruising
speed. The engine spins up to the required number of revolutions needed to
meet these needs with maximum efficiency - and the transmission accelerates
the car in the most efficient way to 'catch up' with the accelerator
setting, and subsequently cruises the vehicle at the most economical engine
speed.
The proclaimed advantage of the CVT is that it allows the engine to operate
in its most efficient revolution band. The driver has to do no more than
engage forward or reverse; the energy-sapping losses caused by the hydraulic
torque converter of a conventional automatic transmission - which typically
produced fuel consumption 15 per cent worse than a manual as well as
weakening performance - are largely absent.
Lapworth acknowledges that the CVT is a desirable transmission. However, it
costs more than a conventional automatic transmission - and still has more
inherent energy losses than a manual transmission. 'It will become a better
proposition if and when a car maker produces both a CVT and an engine which
are specifically designed to work together,' says Lapworth. 'But if you had
to rate them in cold energy efficiency terms, on a scale of one to 10, the
manual would be at 10, fully developed CVT engine/transmission at nine and
the existing conventional automatic at six or seven.
'And if you accept that you don't need synchromesh in our type of
transmission, you could pack in six or seven gear ratios in the same space,
so that for most drivers you would have something very close to a CVT
anyway.'
Although the autoshift is currently Prodrive's only serious road car
project, Lapworth says there is much potential for applying motor
sport-based technology on a wider front - 'cars are full of things hydraulic
and mechanical which could be better controlled', he says.
