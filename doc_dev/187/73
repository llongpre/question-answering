   Sleek, powerful sports cars and
imaginative high-tech wizardry highlight the 28th Tokyo Motor Show,
which opens for a 12-day run Friday.
   Japan's 11 automakers are joined by manufacturers from 15
countries, including South Korea and the Soviet Union, showing off
gadgetry ranging from fingerprint-recognition to built-in personal
computers and fax machines.
   Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Isuzu and Subaru all have new
or prototype sports cars reflecting the trend toward bigger, more
powerful engines.
   Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, is showing off its 4500GT
concept car, a sleek sports car with a 4.5-liter powerhouse engine
churning out 300 horsepower. Concept cars are often built to give
engineers an idea how it will look and perform. Modificiations,
sometimes major, may be made if the car goes into production.
   ``I see more diversification into many varieties of sports
cars,'' said Toyota product planning engineer Masataka Esaki.
``Large, small, for winding roads, highway cruising, off-road
driving.''
   Depending on the response, concept cars displayed at the Tokyo
show could become production models.
   Honda has its $56,000 NSX, an aluminum-bodied, Ferrari-like
speedster to be released in Japan and the United States next year.
   Mazda is rolling out its Eunos Roadster, called the MX-5 Miata
overseas, which has proven itself as the hottest sports car of the
year. Introduced in September, it has already sold out its entire
U.S. stock. The gull-wing TD-R concept sports car, with its
1.6-liter turbo engine, is designed especially for off-road driving.
   Mitsubishi's concept sports car is the 3-liter HSX, which is so
aerodynamic-conscious it has hidden air spoilers that extend or
lift when the car hits certain speeds or curves.
   Isuzu is showing off its conceptual ``Super Midship'' 4200R, a
flat racer-like four-seater packed with digital dials and a pop-up
TV screen for navigation.
   To top off the sports car lineup is Subaru's Caspita, jointly
developed with the unlikely partner Wacoal, Japan's major women's
underwear manufacturer. The 3.5-liter, 12-cylinder Caspita will
carry a supercharged price tag of at least $357,000, a Subaru
official said.
   Ferrari, Porsche, Lotus, Jaguar and other foreign autmomakers
also displayed new sports cars and prototypes they unveiled
previously.
   Nissan's Neo-X is an ``intelligent'' car with holographic
displays, laser radar systems and electronic tire pressure sensors.
The station wagon-like Boga has a fingerprint-recognition device
for unlocking the driver's door that can recognize up to 10
different fingerprints.
   Nissan's futuristic Primera-X has a rear TV camera that projects
images onto the rearview mirror for backing up and a highly
accurate navigation system that displays street maps on a
television screen.
   Japan's No. 2 automaker also unveiled its hatchback NX-Coupe,
primarily for export to the United States from next year, the
phaeton-like Figaro, a so-called ``retro'' two-seater whose design
harks back to the 1950s but which is equipped with a turbocharged
1-liter engine, and the Chapeau, a futuristic-looking cargo vehicle.
   Mazda is also showing that it is expanding into the
micro-minicar market, including one in a snappy gull-wing version.
   Mitsubishi is bringing out its prototype RVR, a Jeep-like
beachmobile of the future.
   Some vans on display show sophisticated technological
innovation. Mazda's MPV Executive is an office on wheels, with a
personal computer, facsimile machine and built-in VHS video deck
suspended from the ceiling.
   Nissan's Caravan has a stacked component audio system and a fax
machine for receiving photos of the Earth from a weather satellite.
``Executives want to know about the weather when it comes to
playing golf,'' a Nissan official said.
