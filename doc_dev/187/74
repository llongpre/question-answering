<LEADPARA>  The number of arrests of the anti-abortionists in Wichita, Kansas is alarming:
more than 1900 people, with 80-some being members of the clergy.;   Compare
that number with the arrests in the anti-war riots in San Francisco and the
People's Park riots in Berkeley. In both of those we saw car window smashing,
fires being set, and other violence from the rioters. In the Wichita arrests,
we see non-violence by the protesters. Something is very wrong! These
protesters are trying to save lives.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In the clinics in Wichita, a baby in its mother's womb for six months can
be killed. Americans are supposed to be endowed with the inalienable right to
life. That unborn baby is living until the abortionist takes that life.
Despite the volumes of rhetoric of the pro-abortionists to justify the taking
of this life, any thinking person must face the fact that a living unborn
infant is killed.;   I applaud the courageous people in Kansas who have put
their lives on the line to save others' lives. I believe our Constitution
guarantees the right to life.;   -- Joan Conner; San Jose; NO LETTER-WRITING
CAMPAIGN FOR HAMER; Contrary to the tone of your Aug. 9 editorial, the
Milpitas Rotary Club is not conducting a letter-writing campaign in order to
keep Pete Hamer on the Milpitas City Council.;   One of our members, Normand
LaCroix, made a request, which I conveyed to our club: that letters may be
sent on Pete's behalf to Judge Thomas Hastings prior to sentencing. Such
petitions are normal and routine. Hamer has been a club member, has no prior
criminal record, has worked hard serving our community, has already lost a
lot, and stands to possibly lose even more while trying to hold his family
together. In addition to this, he may have to serve time in jail.;   The
Milpitas Rotary Club's intentions are purely humanitarian.;   -- Frank J. De
Smidt; President; Milpitas Rotary Club; WHO CARES ABOUT SEEING PLAYERS SPIT?;
Let's face it: Not all sports video coverage is great, and baseball coverage
is the pits.;   Who says we are supposed to be interested in steely eyed
glares, spitting technique and various parts of the anatomy that itch? Why is
following every moment of the flight of the ball so essential that we never
get to see more than a fleeting glimpse of the base runner?;   Is a fielder
important only when the ball happens to fall into his glove? And what does he
do while the pitcher and catcher occupy the center of the screen? Does he
wander about aimlessly, or is he actually involved in some kind of defensive
strategy?;   The people who control video coverage too often forget that there
is a lot more happening on the field than two guys with a ball trying to fool
a third guy with a stick. Maybe it's time we sent the current crew of camera
people to the ping-pong circuit and get some others who understand the game.; 
 -- Jack Grube; San Jose; Forget about ethnic; balance; just teach; This is in
response to your article regarding segregation in the East Side Union High
Schools (Mercury News, Aug. 15):;   Perhaps if the administration and teachers
would put their emphasis on the three R's and educating the students instead
of whether the classroom is ethnically balanced, maybe students coming out of
the schools could read, write and add two numbers without a calculator.;   --
Carrie Chelberg; San Jose;  Equal rights for gays; isn't 'special privilege';
Those who argue that gays should not be granted "special privileges" are
distorting the intent of anti-discriminatory legislation.;   In the case of
religious beliefs, we do not say that Christians or Jews are asking for
special privileges -- we are saying that all religious beliefs deserve equal
protection under the law. Likewise, gays are not asking for special rights; we
are saying that civil rights should not be denied anyone on the basis of their
sexual orientation, whether they are gay, bi- or heterosexual.;   -- Rik
Isensee; San Francisco; Buy B-2 bombers; or training? Hmm; What will our
druthers be? . . . $4.2 billion for four B-2 bombers or spend that amount on
training for almost 2 million workers?;   The choice is being made in Congress
now on how to use our hard-earned taxes!;   -- George Svenson; Watsonville  </TEXT>
