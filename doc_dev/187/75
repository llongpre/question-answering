   While some car buyers are drawn to big rebates,
others can't resist paying $40,000 over list price for a new set of
wheels.
   The Acura NSX is commanding that kind of money from those who
want an exotic car without a Ferrari or Lamborghini price tag.
   ``It's a bargain,'' said sales manager Betsy Volaric of Sunshine
Acura in Farmington Hills.
   The NSX, which looks a bit like a shrunken Ferrari Testarosa,
carries a list price of $60,000 with a manual transmission and
$63,000 for one with an automatic.
   But since Acura, the luxury division of Honda Motor Co. Ltd. of
Japan, plans to import just 3,000 of them a year, demand is far
outpacing supply.
   That pumps up the price.
   Premiums on cars are nothing new to the auto industry. Last
year, buyers shelled out up to $25,000 for the hard-to-get Mazda
Miata, which carried a base price of $13,800.
   Volaric said her dealership, one of 300 Acura dealers in the
country, is tacking $20,000 to $25,000 onto the price of the NSX,
because that's what the market will bear.
   ``Anybody who is familiar with the exotic car market realizes
that $85,000 is a bargain,'' she said. Ferraris and Lamborghinis
begin at more than $100,000 and stretch past $300,000 each, before
any premium.
   Acura spokesman Mike Spencer said dealers in markets with high
exotic-car interest, such as Los Angeles and Miami, are getting up
to $100,000 for an NSX - $40,000 over sticker price.
   ``Legally, we can't tell the dealers what to sell the cars
for,'' he said. ``At the same time, they look at this as `Geez, if
Isell the car to a speculator for $60,000 and he turns around and
sells it for $80,000 to $90,000, who's the fool here?'''
   A fool has no place behind the wheel of an NSX. The sleek,
two-seater packs a 3-liter, V-6 engine which puts out 270
horsepower. It's top speed is rated around 165 mph, and it can go
from a standing start to 60 mph in about 5.5 seconds.
   Tooling around Detroit freeways in an NSX causes normally vacant
highway stares to come alive. Even at highway speeds, motorists
hover around the NSX for a closer look.
   In a recent test drive:
   -The driver of a Mazda RX-7 on the right looked for a minute,
dropped back for a different view, came up on the left for another
peek and moved to the front to take a look at the NSX in his
rearview mirror.
   Afterwards, he dropped back to the right, nodded his head up and
down vigorously and flashed a thumbs-up sign.
   -A load of what appeared to be teen-agers in an Oldsmobile
pulled alongside and accelerated, appearing to dare a highway race.
The NSX is a conspicuous car and the offer was ignored.
   Parked at a local mall, the car was a magnet for nearly everyone
who walked by, including car crazies and store clerks.
   ``I thought it was a Ferrari,'' said Denise DiDonato, of
Rochester Hills, a cosmetics clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue in a
suburban Detroit shopping mall. ``It's cute, very cute.''
   She owns a 1990 Lincoln Town Car - 56.8 inches longer and 1,000
pounds heavier than an NSX.
   Kevin Corcoran, of Franklin, could have been doing an
advertisement for the car: ``It's extraordinarily flashy and
reasonably priced as far as these things go. There's a lot of
Italian in it.''
   Corcoran owns a pickup, in which he spends most of his highway
time, and a McLaren, an extremely low-volume exotic sports car.
   With a target volume of 3,000 annually, the NSX doesn't pose a
significant volume threat to any car now being sold in the United
States.
   It's priced somewhere around a Porsche 911, the Mercedes-Benz
300-series, a BMW 7-series or a Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1, the
hottest car made by a major American manufacturer.
   The NSX doesn't look nearly as muscular as the ZR-1, and it
isn't. The ZR-1's 5.7-liter, V-8 engine produces 375 horsepower,
nearly 30 percent more than the NSX.
   The all-aluminum NSX makes up for some of that difference in
weight, coming in at 3,010 pounds compared with the ZR-1 at 3,465
pounds.
   Canadian visitor Craig Donnelly is an NSX fan. He said he had a
poster of a black one back home in Ottawa, where he also has a
Pontiac Sunbird.
   ``It's got the same size engine as that,'' he said nodding to
the NSX, ``but it doesn't go like that.''
