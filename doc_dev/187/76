<LEADPARA>  ON YOUR way to Yosemite or the Redwood Empire this summer, you're bound to get
stuck in traffic behind a station wagon with out-of-state tags. It'll be
chock-full of family members, suitcases, coolers and toys.;    You'd love to
pass, especially because the kids keep sticking out their tongues at you and
it looks like they've been eating Doritos. But there's an RV in the other
lane, big, slow and covered with bumper stickers.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     You're considering turning around and heading home until you remember how
lucky you are. The breeze is blowing through your hair, the music is pouring
out of your coaxial speakers and your car -- your new convertible -- will make
this a summer to remember.;    Same scene, different car: Why turn around, you
tell yourself, because your exit is in five miles and in less than a half-hour
you'll slide back the door of your minivan (or unlatch the gate of your
sport-utility vehicle), take a deep breath and a long look and start a week of
camping in the great outdoors.; (hbox);    You'll be seeing more of the cars
of summer -- convertibles for singles and couples, minivans and sport-utility
vehicles for families on the go -- this season. The reason is simple: They're
the cars more people want, which means more varieties are available.;   
"Summer is obviously a wonderful time to have a convertible," said Fred Aikins
of the Mazda Information Bureau. Mazda sells two: the MX-5 Miata and the
RX-7.;    Back in 1980, only 59,900 of 9 million new cars sold in the United
States were rag-tops. Last year, about 200,000 of the 10 million new cars sold
were convertibles. Model choices have blossomed from 10 in 1980 to more than
20 in 1990 to more than 30 this year.;    Choices range from a Geo Metro LSi
with a base price of $9,740 to $226,700 for a Rolls-Royce Corniche complete
with a standard cellular phone. Many of the most popular models sell for
$15,000 to $20,000.;    Minivans didn't exist until nine years ago when
Chrysler introduced its Voyager and Caravan. Today's families have made the
roomy, stylish vehicles a favorite. Minivan sales doubled from 1985 to 1990,
when 926,000 were sold.;    In all, minivans made up about 7 percent of all
U.S. vehicle sales for the first four months of this year.;    It should be
noted that the federal government has different safety standards for minivans
and some utility vehicles than it does for passenger cars. However, stronger
safety regulations have been adopted for these vehicles and some manufacturers
already build larger vehicles that meet these standards.;    Chrysler still
makes the most popular models, but Chevrolet, Toyota, Mazda and Ford all offer
minivans in the $13,000 to $15,000 range.;    Some smaller sport-utility
vehicles -- notably the Jeep Wrangler and the Geo Tracker -- even come with
removable tops. But the larger models are the ones taking today's families on
the road. The Ford Explorer, Mitsubishi Montero, Oldsmobile Bravada, Mazda
Navajo and Jeep Grand Wagoneer among others -- offer luxury and rugged
dependability.;    "If you're going on vacation with your family, a two-seat
convertible is going to limit you," Aikins said. That's where minivans and
sport-utility vehicles come in, he said. These vehicles come in two-door and
four-door models with a wide range of options and price ranges. Many offer a
four-wheel-drive option.;    In some instances, Aikins said, these vehicles
are easier to drive and park than the station wagons, "the hulking land yachts
of the '60s or '70s," they have replaced.;    "Sport utility trucks have grown
dramatically over the last three or four years," Craig Oppenlander, an
Oldsmobile spokesman, told the New York Times. "Four-door models are
particularly popular." Oldsmobile's Bravada, new for '91, has plenty of nooks,
shelves, storage bins and bins for cargo.;    Here's a look at some of the
vehicles that'll be sharing the road with you this summer:;     Convertibles:;
for wind in your hair;  (box) Dodge Shadow. A convertible version of this
popular compact car joined the Chrysler lineup in 1991. With a base price
around $13,000, the Shadow isn't blessed with options, and the top operates
manually. The engine is a basic 2.5-liter, four-cylinder. However, a
turbocharged (152 horsepower) version can be ordered. Both five-speed manual
and three-speed automatic transmissions are available, and the Shadow comes
standard with a driver's-side air bag.;    (box) Mazda Miata. Those who didn't
fall in love with the Miata slammed it as just an updated version of the
two-seat British sports car for today's "thirtysomething" crowd. Heck, even
those who do love it can see the similarity. For 1991, Mazda furnishes the
punch line: a Limited Edition Miata ($19,249) with British Racing Green
exterior, tan leather interior and amenities like air conditioning, power
windows, cruise control and a CD player.;    The regular model, with its
1.6-liter, four-cylinder engine, has a base price of $14,200.;    (box)
Chrysler LeBaron: Here's another Chrysler, and this one is the world's most
popular convertible. Four-wheel anti-lock brakes are a new option for '91. The
base price is just under $16,000, but adding on options can take the price to
$22,000. Auto writers have praised this car: how it rides, how it looks and
how its top works.;    (box) Alfa Romeo Spider: Available for the first time
with automatic transmission, the Spider is a classic two-seat sports car. The
two-liter, fuel-injected four-cylinder engine has good power. Only 2,400 of
these cars, first designed in 1966, will be imported to the United States this
year. Prices range from $20,950 to $22,950.;    (box) Volkswagen Cabriolet: A
VW best-seller, the Cabriolet has a power top for the first time in 1991.
Three versions are offered, from a base model that starts at $16,540 to the
Etienne Aigner designer edition for $20,940. This one has nicer upholstery,
not surprising considering it's named for a maker of upscale leather goods.
This is a fun, peppy car that is still popular on college campuses.;    (box)
Infiniti M30: Nissan's luxury division offers this powerful version of its
hardtop M30 for the first time this year. The three-liter, V-6 engine produces
162 horsepower. Its claim to fame is its one-touch convertible top. It's
similar to the system used in the Mercedes-Benz 500SL. The difference? The
Infiniti sells for $31,000, the Mercedes for $90,000.;     Minivans:; room for
the family;  (box) Plymouth Voyager/Dodge Caravan: These were the first of the
minivans and still snare almost 50 percent of the market. Redesigned for 1991,
they still seem boxy when compared with the futuristic Toyota Previa. They are
the only minivans with air bags and are known for smooth driving. Buyers face
plenty of choices: four-cylinder or V-6 engine; standard or extended length;
all-wheel drive and anti-lock brake options. The base price is just over
$13,000.;    (box) Ford Aerostar: Critics say Ford's minivan still feels more
like a pickup truck than a car. It offers plenty of cargo room and a powerful
engine. From a base price of $13,131, buyers can add options.;    (box) Toyota
Previa: It has the highest base price ($14,968) among the minivans, and
options can make things a lot more expensive. But this vehicle, introduced in
1990, has an appealing design and 158 cubic feet of rear cargo room.;    (box)
Mazda MPV: Much praised for its handling, ride and design, the MPV has a base
price of $13,715. Options include a three-liter, V-6 engine, all-wheel drive
and partial anti-lock brakes.;    (box) Chevrolet Lumina APV: With a base
price of $14,730, the Lumina has plastic body panels, which don't rust or
dent. The styling is very futuristic, and the vehicle has good power and cargo
space. GM's Pontiac Transport and Oldsmobile Silhouette are essentially
similar.;    Sport utility:; looking for fun;  (box) Ford Explorer. Released
in 1990 as a 1991 model, Explorer is now the best seller among four-door
models. The ride is smooth. Room for passengers and cargo is abundant. Base
price starts at $14,451 for the basic two-door XL and tops out at $21,566 for
the four-door, four-wheel-drive Eddie Bauer model.;    (box) Oldsmobile
Bravada. This new model has full-time four-wheel drive and plenty of standard
equipment. It has a 4.3-liter V-6 engine and uses the SmartTrak system, which
meters 65 percent of the power to the rear wheels and 35 percent to the front.
The base price for the four-door model is $23,795.;    (box) Jeep Cherokee.
Lots of size and model options, with prices from $13,060 for the two-door
version to $24,229 for the four-door, four-wheel-drive Briarwood.;    (box)
Mitsubishi Montero. This large, four-wheel-drive vehicle has plenty of cargo
space and V-6 engine. Prices range from $15,489 for the standard model to
$18,799 for the LS.  </TEXT>
