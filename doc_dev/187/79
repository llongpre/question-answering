<F P=106> [Interview with K. Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen, by I. 
Rotar; place and date not given: "Become Our Satellites or 
Perish]" 
  [Text] 
<H5>  That is the view held by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the </H5>
State Duma Comittee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen. 
<H5>  Revelations </H5>
  [Zatulin] I am an admirer of the empire if it is understood 
as imperial peace. I am not a proponent of ultranationalist 
empires and regard that concept as a means for the maintenance 
of peace. There is such a concept as sphere of influence, sphere 
of vital interest, regardless of whether you are a democrat or 
not. A small country must be happy that it is within the sphere 
of influence of a big power. A vivid example of that is the 
economic blossoming of postwar Japan when it was under the aegis 
of the U.S.A. The policy in the CIS is the domestic policy of 
Russia whether that offends anyone or not. We must win our 
special role in the near abroad. 
  [Rotar] Do you recognize the territorial integrity of 
countries of the near abroad? 
  [Zatulin] It is impossible to be pulling chestnuts out of 
the 
fire for others and recognize the territorial integrity of 
states which never existed within those borders. With all due 
respect for those states, many of them are destined to become 
our satellites or perish and I recognize their territorial 
integrity right up to that degree. 
  [Rotar] What meaning do you attach to the concept of a 
satellite? 
  [Zatulin] Countries of the near abroad must conclude special 
agreements establishing their special relations with Russia. 
That is neither relations within the framework of the USSR nor 
is it simply membership in the CIS the effectiveness of which is 
under question. Our special relations must deal primarily with 
the economy and the problem of national minorities living in 
those states. Russia must assume the protection of Russians 
living in the near abroad. If the national minorities live in 
compact groups, they must be granted autonomy--the state must 
become a federation. The special status of regions populated by 
national minorities must be backed up with guarantees from 
Moscow. 
  [Rotar] Could you indicate specifically which of the 
countries in the near abroad should have autonomies? 
  [Zatulin] Georgia--Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Moldova--the 
Dniester Region and Gagaus. Kazakhstan--northern part of the 
republic. Ukraine--eastern regions and Crimea. 
  [Rotar] How do you view the political situation in Georgia? 
  [Zatulin] The viewpoint that everyone, except the Georgians, 
is responsible for its troubles is still prevalent in Georgia. 
Recently, for instance, we had a meeting with a Georgian 
parliamentary delegation and one of its members consistently 
stressed that Russia must grant every concession since Georgia 
made a sacrifice by joining the CIS. This is some kind of a 
hypertrophied concept of reality. Let us begin with the fact 
that Russia helped the current leader of Georgia win in the most 
acute domestic confrontation with the, by the way, legal, 
president Eduard Gamsakhurdia. That gave Shevardnadze a great 
advantage (I am not even going to mention that Russia saved him 
from death in Abkhazia). Russia confirmed the territorial 
integrity of Georgia whereas in reality it does not exist, 
helped the republic economically, and in return received only 
the entry of that state into the CIS which thus far is a rather 
amorphous formation. 
  [Rotar] In your opinion what future awaits Ukraine? 
  [Zatulin] This is a complicated question. I believe that 
here 
there are fewer chances than in Moldova and Georgia that 
objective realities will be recognized. One political wing 
(mainly those who came from Western Ukraine) is adamantly 
dreaming of participation in all foreign political blocs hostile 
to Russia and visualizes the only possibility for existence of 
an independent Ukrainian state to be with the support of the 
enemies of Russia. But I am still hoping that the resolution of 
the problem will be the same as in Moldova and Georgia: alliance 
with Russia and a special status reinforced with guarantees by 
Moscow for eastern regions and Crimea. This is the only 
relatively peaceful outcome. The other variant means the 
disintegration of Ukraine. 
  [Rotar] Today Russian soldiers are dying in Tajikistan. One 
of the more widespread explanations of the reason for 
nonwithdrawal of the Russian army from that country consists is 
that Russia has no funds for the maintenance of a new border 
region. But even today Moscow is compelled to invest significant 
sums in that country. Tajikistan may turn into a bottomless pit 
for Russian money. 
  [Zatulin] Any expenditure is justified to preserve that 
outpost. 
  [Rotar] Do you have disagreements with the Russian MID 
[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]? 
  [Zatulin] After December, you understand what I am referring 
to, the Russian MID sharply changed its positions and our 
official positions are practically the same. It is true, I do 
lack confidence that declarations of the Russian MID will be 
implemented in practice.
