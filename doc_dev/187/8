   Deere &amp; Co. said its John Deere Technologies International
unit agreed to sell its rotary-engine assets to closely held
Tahoe Co., Lincoln, Neb.
   Deere declined to say how much it expects to receive in
the transaction, which is expected to close by June 30.

<TEXT>
   John Deere Technologies, "composed almost entirely of
Deere's rotary-engine assets," performs contract research and
development work on such engines, much of it for the Defense
Department.
   Deere, a Moline, Ill., maker of farm, industrial and
lawn-care equipment, purchased the rotary operations in 1984,
said a spokesman.
   While the technology "holds significant promise" in both
military and commercial applications, the spokesman said,
"given the prospects for diminished funding" from the Defense
Department, "we made a strategic evaluation and elected to
exit the business."
   Tahoe said it has been developing a technology designed to
increase rotary-engine performance and reduce emissions.
