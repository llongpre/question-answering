   The Rev. Jesse Jackson's interview with Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein and some former hostages will be shown in a four-part
series starting Sept. 4 on ``Inside Edition.'' Iraqi officials cut
from the tape a warning by Saddam that foreigners hiding from Iraqi
forces in Kuwait could be treated as spies, said producer Ken

for the costs of getting himself and his 14-member crew to Iraq,
the show's representatives said.
