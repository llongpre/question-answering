   A fundraising campaign aimed at providing
vaccines to immunize the world's children against six deadly and
disabling diseases was announced Thursday by several celebrities
and two public service organizations.
   ``There are seven children dying every minute somewhere in the
world because of these diseases and an additional seven disabled by
them every minute,'' said Herbert Pigman, director of Rotary
International's immunization task force.
   ``This can all be prevented if only if we can deliver vaccines
in that critical first year of a baby's life _ vaccines that cost
well under a dollar for all six'' diseases, he added.
   Jerry Michaud, executive director of the End Hunger Network
said: ``The goal is to immunize all the world's children by 1990.
We want to get the Hollywood community involved in promoting this
campaign.''
   While no specific monetary goal has been set by the two groups,
Michaud said the funds raised by their ``Chance of a Lifetime''
campaign will be turned over to UNICEF, CARE, Save the Children
Foundation, Project Concern and other reputable groups to deliver
the vaccines to Third World nations.
   The vaccines are those meant to prevent measles, polio,
diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and tuberculosis, which kill 3{
million children and disable another 3{ million each year, Pigman
said.
   Campaign spokesman Alan Feldman said syndicated TV situation
comedy stars attending Thursday's kickoff were Dyana Ortelli and
8-year-old Humberto Ortiz, both of ``Marblehead Manor;''
11-year-old Soleil Moon Frye, of ``Punky Brewster;'' Joyce DeWitt,
of ``Three's Company;'' and 11-year-old Taliesin Jaffe, of ``She's
The Sheriff.''
   Chris Templeton, who suffered polio and stars in CBS's ``The
Young and the Restless'' soap opera also attended, Feldman said.
   Michaud said his group will arrange for celebrities to solicit
donations by appearing on talk shows and to broadcast public
service announcements. A toll-free number will be provided during
the announcements so pledges can be accepted, he said.
   Pigman said the new campaign will complement Rotary's 3-year-old
PolioPlus Program, which has been raising money with the goal of
providing polio immunizations to the roughly 100 million children
born anuually in developing nations.
   Through donations from its members and other citizens, Rotary
already has raised $100 million toward its $120-million goal for
the two years ending this June, Pigman said.
   He said the new campaign was announced Thursday because it was
the 40th anniversary of the World Health Organization.
   Rotary, which has about 1 million members in 162 nations, is an
organization of business people aimed at promoting community
improvement, business ethics and international good will and peace,
Pigman said.
   Michaud said the End Hunger Network is a Hollywood-based group
of entertainment community leaders trying to combat hunger and
other deadly problems.
