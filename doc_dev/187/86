   Police in this town 20 miles north of
Dallas are stopping motorists if they're driving courteously. Then,
they pay them.
   Police are handing out $20 cash certificates until Christmas Eve
to good drivers. Cash-winning behavior includes allowing someone to
change lanes or letting a car into the road during bumper-to-bumper
traffic.
   The Christmas-season program, courtesy of the Addison Police
Department and Addison Rotary Club, is in its fifth year. Last
year, 200 drivers received the certificates.
   ``Texas is known as the `Friendly State.' We wanted to encourage
that Texas spirit in Addison by rewarding friendly drivers during
the holiday season,'' Addison Rotary Club President Sam Zarro said.
   Police Capt. Tommy Buchanan said some drivers aren't all that
nice when police pull them over.
   ``Some of them are upset when you first stop them, but when they
find out, they get an attitudinal change,'' Buchanan said.

   Walt Disney Pictures is the winner
of the 1989 Dunce Cap Award by SPELL, the Society for the
Preservation of English Language and Literature, for the popular
film, ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.''
   It should have been ``Honey, I Shrank the Kids.''
   SPELL, a 2,000-member, non-profit organization based in Mountain
View, confers the annual awards on ``perpetrators of especially
egregious errors in usage, spelling and punctuation inflicted on
the public's sensibilities.''
   Richard Lederer, author of ``Anguished English,'' ``Get Thee to
a Punnery,'' and ``Crazy English,'' is the sole judge.
   ``We're not grammar police, as some people have called us,''
said William S. Penn Jr., SPELL's vice president and a retired
business professor at San Jose State. ``We're just people who think
the English language should be saved from the careless and
ignorant.''
   A Disney official defended the use of ``shrunk.''
   ``It was done deliberately. It was not an error,'' said the
official, who wouldn't give his name. ``That's what Rick Moranis,
the father in the movie, says: ``Honey, I shrunk the kids.'' The
title was taken from that.''
   And it worked, the official said: The film grossed more than
$129 million.
   SPELL's dart wasn't news to Disney. Dozens of people wrote or
called to point it out, the official said.
