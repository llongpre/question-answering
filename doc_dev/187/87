<F P=106> [Letter to the editor from Zatulin: "I am not Bismarck, </F>
but..."] It is said that the average Frenchwoman can make three 
things out of any material on hand: a hat, an umbrella, and a 
tragedy. It was with interest that I acquainted myself with the 
attempt by Igor Rotar to present my views on the near abroad 
("Become Our Satellites or Perish" in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 5 May 
of this year). It seems to me that this is a contemporary 
variant of how with the aid of uncomplicated tricks, 
misrepresentation, double entente, and rearrangement of words 
coming from me, direct speech under the heading of "Revelations" 
is transformed by a foreign correspondent into a tragedy or an 
Ems dispatch. 
  At one time in editing an innocent text of a dispatch 
Bismarck precipitated the Franco-Prussian War. Naturally I 
cannot claim to be Bismarck or someone as important as he, but I 
categorically object against the situation where I. Rotar, 
acting as a guide and interpreter for his Japanese colleague at 
the meeting some month-and-a-half ago, now becomes wise at my 
expense, juggling the text which I have never seen. 
  Such an interest manifests itself particularly in the way in 
which the question regarding Tajikistan is posed and the manner 
in which the correspondent patiently coaches "my" reply, sharing 
wisdom and truth. But unfortunately he cannot get an intelligent 
answer from his slow-witted interlocutor as to which is better: 
have one's head torn off or go on vacation. 
  On the eve of Victory Day it is worth noting the fact that 
the word satellite in the newest Russian philology has a 
pejorative connotation which the word ally does not have at all 
and the author undoubtedly must know that. I leave "my 
revelations" of the type: "A small country must be happy that it 
is within the sphere of influence of a big power," as well as 
the abundance of military field terminology (such as "winning", 
"dying," etc.) on his conscience." I think that Russia, just as 
the USA and the entire world community, is not indifferent to 
the observance of the rights of an individual and not only a 
Russian one and not just in the YuAR [Republic of South Africa] 
but in the CIS as well. 
  The topics touched upon in this piece constitute material 
for 
a long article and not a brief comment. I will limit myself to 
the observation that CIS countries are not bowling pins and 
Russian journalists, in the intervals between representation of 
foreign professional interests, should not attempt to place all 
of those in the Duma in moulds of Vladimir Volfovich 
[Zhirinovskiy], even if they have been stored up for use in 
future articles. 
  Respectfully, 
Signed Konstantin Zatulin, 6 May 1994 
  [From NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Editor] We are publishing the 
letter from Mr. Zatulin, but because of the conflicting 
situation that developed the editorial office will now be forced 
to carefully compare the text of the taped interview with what 
was published in the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA and then return to this 
topic. The editorial office, however, is certain that Mr. Rotar 
does not speak either Japanese or English and therefore could 
not have been "an interpreter for a Japanese colleague" as 
asserted by Mr. Zatulin. Nevertheless the editorial office is 
also entertaining those premises of Mr. Zatulin which are 
illegitimate.
