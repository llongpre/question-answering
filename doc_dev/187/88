<LEADPARA>  When Fred Weibel moved from his native Switzerland to Fremont in 1945, he
could look out his window and count on one hand the number of house lights
twinkling in the night.;   Now, there's development all around him. His famed,
sprawling 96-acre Weibel winery is an oasis of grape vines in a sea of
single-family homes.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Even that oasis may disappear. The historic winery property is up for sale
and slated for potential housing development.;   But amid the change, some
things stay the same. Fred and his wife, Marlene, still serve an array of
civic groups: Fred Weibel, 74, a former Fremont school board member, has been
a devoted member of Rotary International for 27 years. In all that time, he
hasn't missed a single weekly meeting. (When he travels, he attends Rotary
meetings at his destination, whether it's Amsterdam or Tokyo). He also is a
member of the Ohlone College Foundation board of trustees and the Washington
Township Men's Club. He's known for giving away bottles of wine to those
furthering civic causes, and he contributes to the Washington Hospital
Foundation, the Fremont Chamber of Commerce and the Fremont Police
Association.;   Marlene Weibel, 47, office manager at the Weibel winery, is a
Washington Hospital Foundation trustee; an honorary member of Fremont
Candlelighters fund-raisers; and a member of Rotary Interwheel, women
fund-raisers.;   "It's very difficult to separate Fred and Marlene Weibel,"
said Keith Medeiros, an Alameda County school board member and longtime friend
of the Weibels. "They're both involved in so many civic organizations. As far
as I'm concerned, they're down to earth, good-natured people. They both really
give of themselves.";   And so the couple is being honored Friday for
"distinguished community leadership" at the Ohlone College Foundation's annual
benefit luncheon. The event -- already sold out -- also marks Ohlone College's
25th anniversary.;   "It makes you feel good to be honored," Fred Weibel said.
"But I want to support any group that's civic-minded. It's the way I was
raised. My mother always said everybody owes something to their community
besides taxes and I believe that.";   How do they fit everything into their
schedules?;   "I depend on other people just like they depend on me. We have a
good staff at the winery," Marlene Weibel said. "I can depend on them to take
care of things if I need to get away.";   Says Fred: "It's hard, but I always
prioritize. Making a living comes first. Apart from that, Rotary is the most
important.";   Just as important -- at least on weekends -- is Fred's sailing
hobby. Every Sunday, he plies San Francisco Bay on his 65-foot sailboat
Northstar.;   Marlene Weibel won't step foot on the boat unless it's docked.
She prefers to stay home and hook rugs.;   Fred Weibel moved from Bern,
Switzerland with his father, Rudolf, in 1945. They bought the former Leland
Stanford Winery in the city's Mission San Jose because the easily drained
soil, hot days and cold nights were considered ideal for growing wine grapes
as they had in Switzerland.;   Fred and Marlene met 25 years ago, when
Marlene's uncle worked as chief electrician for the Weibel winery; her uncle
injured his foot one day and Marlene drove him to work, where the two saw each
other. Four years later, they got hitched.;   Fred Weibel had already
established himself as a community leader. Friends persuaded him to join the
Fremont school board in 1968 and he served more than 13 years.;   During that
time, parents insulted the trustees, blaming them for problems including tight
budgets following passage of the property-tax slashing Proposition 13 in
1978.;   "I was railroaded," he said. "I had no idea what I was getting into.
I wanted to help youngsters. I stayed with it for 13 1/2 years. My attorney
said even a murderer is entitled to parole after 13 1/2 years. So I asked for
parole."  </TEXT>
