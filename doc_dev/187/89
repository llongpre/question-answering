<TEXT>     The front yard of their North 17th Street home is a tribute to
wind-direction diligence. It is the Altamont Pass of downtown San Jose. A
patch of spring green lawn dotted with 14 windmills and weather vanes shifting
like a dance troupe with each subtle change in the direction or speed of the
prevailing breeze.;    These are not small, cutesy little roosters that you
can pick up at Pay 'N Pak.;    These are 10-foot-tall contraptions made from
odds and ends and antiques and castoffs. It seems if Walter Williams had his
way, there would be no junk yards or landfills, only windmills and weather
vanes.;    Walter, a 79-year-old retired plumber, builds the wind machines
from old bicycle wheels, hubcaps, light fixtures, key chains, planters,
candleholders and spent ammunition shells.;    He cuts conduit pipes in
different lengths and hangs them from spinning wheels so they chime and tinkle
and clang under proper conditions. He uses car parts they don't make anymore
and even the machines that once made the car parts they don't make anymore.;  
 The windmills may be built from the ingredients for a pile of junk, but one
look and you might call them art.;    You might. Walter won't.;    "I just
call them windmills," says Walter, who's a bit puzzled by the attention his
display has drawn over the years.;    If you're looking for some bizarre tale
to explain why a couple, apparently normal in every way, would pack their
normal yard with rows of wind devices, you've come to the wrong neighborhood.;
   The Williams abode, between Empire and Washington streets, is no Winchester
Mystery House of the windmill world. And no, the contraptions do not pump
water or power household appliances. And the fact that Walter grew up in
Missouri and Ada was reared in Nebraska has nothing to do with the couple's
affection for the barnyard fixtures.;    "I just started making them for
something to do," says Walter, who planted the first windmill in his yard
about 15 years ago. "Just something to do, messing around.";    Walter doesn't
need a reason. Some retirees golf. Others fish. Walter makes windmills and
Ada, 78, helps.;    "I hold the rods and things like that when he builds
them," says Ada, a retired Agnews Developmental Center nurse who 17 years ago
met Walter outside the J.C. Penney store downtown.;    In the big scheme, the
windmills don't do much, though Walter swears their vibrations scare gophers
out of his yard. But people like them. They drive by, hit their brakes and
crane their necks. The brave ones stop and take pictures.;    "They're parked
out there all the time looking at them," Walter says of passers-by. "Everybody
likes them. I've never had a word agin' them.";    Not even from the
neighbors.;    "When the wind blows, they jingle a lot," the woman who lives
two doors down says. "I like that. They sound like church bells.";    Despite
the gawkers, the Williams yard is hardly a bona fide tourist attraction, a
fact that is good for them but too bad for the rest of us.;    See, Walter
provides one heck of a tour.;    He walks among his creations decked out in
denim overalls, a flannel shirt, a brown felt cowboy hat and a pair of
scuffed-up black boots. You'll find his polished pair on the living room floor
next to the rotary telephone and against his easy chair. Walter is a man not
past laughing at himself or his own jokes. The good ones rate a
throat-clearing chuckle. The adequate ones, a nasal snigger.;    "This is an
old corn planter here," he says, touching a black cast iron tool that
decorates the base of a windmill. "I've only seen two of these in my
lifetime.";    Two more than most.;    Then he'll point out the motorcycle
wheel, the dangling keys that once opened doors at the Carlton Hotel in
Plainville, Conn. He'll show you the machine used to make brakes for the Model
A and the table designed to hold a Model T engine during a valve job. He'll
point out the steering wheel from an old tractor and the dryer parts and
what's left of a metal ladder and the thingamajig he picked up at a garage
sale or a second-hand shop or a junk yard.;    "I don't know what that is," he
admits.;    Walter doesn't know how many windmills and weather vanes he's
built, either. Maybe 100. He's sold some to neighbors and others to visitors
from windmill-friendly towns such as Gilroy, Oroville and Redding. The
couple's five children have been given their share.;    In the past, each time
one was taken from the yard to be sold or given away, Walter would build
another to take its place. Now he's slowed down a bit. Open-heart surgery last
summer, you know.;    "It's pretty hard work," says Walter.;    Hard. But
worth it.  </TEXT>
