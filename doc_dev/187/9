Semiautomatic Gearbox"] 
  [Text] In racing, it cuts gearshifting time in half. On a 
passenger car, it frees the driver from the "acrobatics" 
required for each shift. The scene is the Limousin Rally, on 10 
October 1993. Approaching a tricky hairpin turn, Jean Ragnoti, 
official driver for the Renault team, is manhandling the 
stickshift of his Clio-Williams and frantically stomping on the 
clutch for a fast downshift. At the same spot, and with the same 
type of car, his teammate Philippe Bugalski, presses lightly 
with his fingers on a "joystick" without letting go of the 
steering wheel, and downshifts three speeds in record time. His 
advantage? A semiautomatic gearbox born from a collaboration 
between Renault Sport and Magneti Marelli. Tested in races, it 
should soon be installed on certain mass produced cars. 
  It is in fact a device which activates a conventional 
gearbox 
in place of the driver. It consists of two components: one is 
mounted on the box and the other on the clutch. The shift 
linkage is replaced by an electric-hydraulic mechanism with five 
small actuators (two linear and three rotary) which select and 
engage the six speeds of an H-pattern gearbox. Also, the clutch 
cable is replaced by an actuator controlled either by a solenoid 
or by the left pedal, thus leaving the driver in control of 
clutch release at certain times, such as when starting the car. 
  The pressure needed for these operations is obtained from a 
150-bar hydraulic pump which is coupled directly to the 
camshaft. Gilles Lallement, head of development at Renault 
Sport, explained that "we opted for this solution in spite of 
the great complexity presented by its implementation. The fact 
is that the very high power of these components makes it 
possible to build actuators that are sufficiently compact and 
fast, characteristics that are essential to such an application." 
  The driver therefore no longer has to expend any effort to 
shift gears. He merely has to pull up on a small handle located 
near his steering wheel to upshift and pull down on it to 
downshift. Instructions are sent to a computer which also 
receives data concerning engine speed, the speed of each wheel, 
the hydraulic pressure... about thirty parameters altogether. 
The computer then calculates the shift sequence. 
<H5>  Adapting Engine Speed </H5>
  To shift up by one or several gears, the computer sends 
instructions to the injection system which then adapts the 
engine speed to the rotation speed of the driveshaft. As soon as 
this synchronization is achieved, the shift is allowed and the 
computer activates the sequence of rotary and translation 
motions needed to engaging the selected gear. The driver can 
thus go from first to fifth while still flooring the gas pedal. 
The strategy is somewhat different for downshifting: In this 
case the computer has to enable the clutch actuator before 
engaging the gear. 
  Patrick Landon, head of the Renault Sport racing department, 
states that "the advantages of this semiautomatic box are 
undeniable in racing." Notably, it cuts in half the time needed 
for shifting: from 0.28 seconds manually for an experienced 
driver to 0.13 seconds in automatic. This means a gain of 0.38 
seconds per kilometer on a custom car! 
  For the average motorist, shaving off a few tenths of a 
second from his commute may hardly seem worth it. But he may 
well be attracted to some of the advantages of this gearbox. 
Adapted to a passenger car, it reduces physical fatigue. It is 
estimated that in city traffic, a driver shifts an average of 
fifty times per kilometer. Pushing the clutch each time, his 
left foot expends a cumulated effort of 100 to 150 newtons, 
which over a distance of 12 kilometers corresponds to moving a 
load of about 7 tons! With only one leg... 
<H5>  No More Acrobatics </H5>
  In addition, the optimization of shift sequences increases 
the life of the gearbox while software safeguards prevent 
downshifting above 8500 rpm to protect against racing the 
engine. And finally, freed from the acrobatics imposed by any 
gear shifting, the driver can concentrate totally on steering 
his vehicle. 
  These advantages are enough for Magneti Marelli to undertake 
the implementation of a version which is intended for "Everyman" 
and which can satisfy the expectations of the luxury car driver 
without frustrating lovers of the stickshift. The possibility of 
adapting it to any existing box without modifications would 
enable car manufacturers to offer this automation as an option, 
at a price lower than that of a completely automatic box. One 
version has already been unveiled at the Frankfurt Salon on an 
Alfa Romeo. Volvo also is said to be thinking of installing it 
very soon on one its top of the line models. 
<H5>  An Enticing Market </H5>
  Other equipment makers are just as convinced of the success 
of "semiautomation" for European drivers. Thus Valeo is devoting 
intense efforts to implementing a similar system. Benoist Hue, 
marketing head of the clutch division, says that "we are already 
putting a mass produced electronic clutch on some Ferraris. And 
we have a number of projects underway to get it installed on 
European cars during 1995. But we will have to wait until the 
following year for completely robotized mass production of 
gearboxes." 
  This is an extremely attractive market for the French 
equipment maker who estimates that by the year 2005, 
semiautomatic gearboxes will have taken over some 12 percent of 
European production. It remains to be seen whether Old World 
motorists can live with a joystick in their hands instead of a 
shift lever...
