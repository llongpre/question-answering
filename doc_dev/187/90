Popovers look spectacular, yet are really very simple to prepare. They're an 
American cousin to English Yorkshire pudding -- the same batter, baked in a 
buttered popover pan or custard cups rather than in a roasting pan of beef 
drippings. 
</P>
<P>
The shell-like structures, hollow in the center, are simply leavened by the 
steam produced during baking. It's not unusual for the batter of eggs, milk, 
flour and salt to triple in volume. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare popovers, measure the ingredients accurately and combine, beating 
with an electric or rotary mixer (Step 1) until smooth and the consistency of 
whipping cream. Note, however, that overbeating the batter prevents the 
popovers from rising properly. 
</P>
<P>
Ladle (Step 2) or pour the batter, filling the prepared cups about 3/4 full. 
Place in an oven preheated to 450 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
This initial high oven temperature converts the moisture in the batter to steam 
and the popovers begin to rise (Step 3). Lowering the oven temperature to 350 
degrees after the first 25 minutes slows browning and dries the interior of the 
popovers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popovers Can Collapse 
</P>
<P>
Do not open the oven door during baking. A draft of air will cause the rising 
popovers to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
For extra crisp popovers, loosen them from the pan when the total baking time 
has elapsed, tilt at an angle and pierce the sides of the popovers with a 
wooden skewer. Turn the oven off and allow the popovers to stand with the oven 
door slightly ajar for eight to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Popover are best served immediately. Well-prepared popovers are large in volume 
and have a crisp, nicely browned exterior (Step 4). The interior cavities 
should be moist, but not soggy. 
</P>
<P>
BASIC POPOVERS 
</P>
<P>
4 eggs 
</P>
<P>
2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon melted butter 
</P>
<P>
Beat eggs lightly with electric mixer or rotary beater. Add milk, flour, salt 
and melted butter. Beat just until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Fill eight (3/4-cup) greased popover pan cups about 3/4 full. Bake at 450 
degrees 25 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue to bake 20 minutes 
longer, until puffed and golden brown. Makes 8 popovers. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Oven-proof glass custard cups may be substituted for popover pan.
