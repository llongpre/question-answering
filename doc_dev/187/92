  [Text] Speaker Jose de Venecia unveiled P [Philippine 
pesos] 29. 7 billion worth of public works and private sector 
infrastuctural and development projects in ceremonies in Baguio 
City yesterday. 
  Most of the projects were being financed with long-term 
Japan 
loans with counterpart allotments approved by Malacanang 
[presidential office] and Congress, De Venecia said before 
Rotarians from Bulacan, Nueva Ecija Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela, 
Quirino, and Cagayan. 
  The projects include the P1.2-billion highway between 
Rosario 
and Pugo Marcos to Baguio City and the P536-million road from 
Naguillan to Burgos, La Union, to the Pines City. 
  With the speaker in surveying the Northern Luzon projects 
were Representatives Rolando Andaya head of the House 
appropriations committee; Representative Bernardo Vergara of 
Baguio City, who helped package the rebuilding program from La 
Union to the summer capital for President Ramos; and Secretary 
Gregorio Vigilar of public works and highways. 
  At the former Camp John Hay gathering, De Venecia said 
Taiwan's Tuntex Group has allocated P25 billion to redevelop the 
tourist city within the former United States military resort 
complex. 
  The Shoemart group led by Henry Sy has decided to build a 
P3-billion five star hotel with a shopping megamall in the old 
Pines Hotel location. 
  De Venecia and Vergara announced a P100-million flyover 
system between the city and La Trinidad, Benguet, to decongest 
the metropolis and create new satellite settlement areas. 
  De Venecia addressed the 75th anniversary of the Rotary 
International District (3770) convention. The district is 
headed by its president, Mar Tupaz. 
  The speaker challenged the Rotarians to harness their 
resources in participating in the government's 
agro-industrialization program through the 
build-operate-transfer law.
