   The telephone has come a long way since the day in 1876 in
Boston when Alexander Graham Bell told his laboratory assistant
over a primitive liquid transmitter, ``Mr. Watson, come here; I
want you.''
   Today, that liquid transmitter has evolved into cordless phones,
tapeless digital answerphones, speakerphones, integrated telephone
answering machines, cellular phones, phones with autodialer memory,
on-hook dialing and voice dialing.
   Voice-dialing phones use voice logic sensor technology to allow
a user to dial any of 50 individual numbers by simply saying the
name of the person or business being called. The programmable phone
stores a voice print of each party's name and number in its memory,
so that when a name is announced, it automatically dials that
number.
   Some models have a built-in answering machine that greets
callers with a digitally-synthesized voice which asks them to dial
in their number so the call can be returned.
   Recently introduced by AT&amp;T are the first answering machines
that respond to rotary phones and voice responses. The two-line
models also are the first to answer calls on one line while taking
a message on the other.
   ``Now, answering machines can get their messages from virtually
any phone, anywhere in the world,'' explains Rob Davis, product
manager for the company's answering machines.
   ``For example, people vacationing at a mountain cabin or a shore
cottage with only a rotary telephone available won't have to jump
in the car and drive to the nearest pay phone to get their
messages.''
   Another recently marketed telephone is a hands-free headset
model which allows a person to listen to FM radio programs but to
answer calls with the touch of a button when the radio reception is
interrupted by an alerting tone.
   Digital technology has enabled engineers to do away with bulky
telephone answering systems and create compact and tapeless digital
answerphones designed for home use.
   With the absence of tape cassettes, the phones are approximately
the size of a standard telephone and have fewer working parts than
conventional answering machines.
   ``Digital recording puts an end to twisted tapes or overworked
parts which break or wear out,'' said a General Electric spokesman,
describing one of the company's models. ``With remote message play,
users can listen to their messages even when they are away from
home.
   ``The phone also features an LED message counter to quickly
display the number of calls received and has an auto-disconnect
function which automatically stops the outgoing message when any
phone in the house is picked up.''
   And for the traveler who wants to dial up the latest stock
prices or call for hotel and plane reservations, the New York
Telephone Company is testing new public computer terminals at New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The company says
customers can access some 150 different travel, financial,
entertainment and information services available at the terminals,
which also are equipped for conference calling.
   ``Preliminary market studies tell us that many airline travelers
_ especially business people _ would use these types of services
frequently,'' says Robert Bellhouse, general manager-public
communications. ``This six-month test will provide use with more
definitive information on the level of market acceptance.''
   The access terminals include video displays, keyboards, and a
telephone handset and keypad.
