with its Punto, a mass-market car with six speeds

Motorists wanting to develop their left leg muscles should try out Fiat's
Punto small car, to be launched in Italy, France and Germany - three of
Europe's biggest car markets - in early November.
While most automobile makers, including Fiat itself, have been developing
increasingly sophisticated automatic transmission technologies, especially
for smaller models used for stop-start urban driving, Italy's leading car
marque has come up with an interesting alternative.
The new Punto range, which is widely seen as being as crucial to Fiat's
success as its predecessor, the Uno, was in the 1980s, includes models with
a standard five-speed gearbox as well an innovative continuously variable
transmission, due next spring. But the company has also unveiled a novel
six-speed gearchange on one the most basic and least powerful of its Puntos.
Six-speed boxes are nothing new. 'Supercars' such as the Corvette Stingray
and BMW's fast and luxurious 8-Series sports coupes already offer them to
performance-minded drivers. More recently, six-speed transmissions have
appeared on more modestly priced, but still potent, sports cars such as the
most powerful version of Vauxhall/Opel's Calibra. In a matter of months,
Fiat itself will be offering a six-speed transmission on a new,
high-performance four-wheel drive version of its sporty Alfa Romeo 164
saloon.
However, the relatively low sales volumes of the six-speed supercars mean
the gearboxes have all been bought in from specialist manufacturers, usually
Germany's Getrag, rather than being produced in-house by the car makers
themselves.
The Punto marks the first time that a mass-market car will offer a
manufacturer-built six-speed box. It will also be the first time a six-speed
transmission has been used in a car with such a small engine. The Punto
version involved has a 1100cc motor, developing just 55 hp (40 kw). In a car
likely to be chosen predominantly for city driving, where frequent gear
changes are essential, what was the point?
Nicola Malara, head of gearbox development at Fiat's car subsidiary,
explains. 'We designed the six-speed box largely for young drivers, who may
have only just passed their driving test, but want to have the sense of fun
associated with a bigger car. The six-speed Punto isn't a turbo or a car
which goes terribly fast, it's more the feeling of a sports car.'
The six-speed transmission is a marriage of marketing and technology. A
number of countries, such as Italy, limit the engine capacity of cars which
can be driven by newly-qualified drivers. Even where there are no such
restrictions, many prospective Punto buyers would not be able to afford
higher-performance cars.
The six-speed transmission is intended to let drivers get the most out of
the modestly powered engine by making them work harder themselves. 'Its
qualities are particularly evident in mixed-condition driving or going up
hills, where the driver has a suitable gear ratio for every situation,'
according to Fiat.
Frequent use of the clutch may not put off many prospective buyers just
making the transition from two to four wheels, reckons Malara. 'For those
used to driving 50cc or 125cc motor scooters, six gears are nothing new;
manufacturers have used them for some time to maximise performance.' And in
Italy, where motor racing is almost a religion, the idea of frequent, snappy
gear changes may appeal to sports-minded public. Malara thinks the model
will also catch on in Germany and Spain, where drivers also value
'performance motoring'.
But Malara denies the six-speed box is just a gimmick to draw first-time
drivers to the Punto. 'The six-speed box, if used properly, will lower fuel
consumption compared with the five-speed version.' And although its appeal
may seem limited at present, Fiat may offer the new transmission on other
small models, such as a successor to the Lancia Y10, he hints.
Either way, the company should benefit. As the six-speed box was a spin-off
from the new five-speed Punto gearbox, development costs were modest. The
six-speed transmission is only slightly heavier and required only modest
additional engineering, says Malara.
On the other hand, if the six-speed transmission catches on, the company
will have stolen a march on its competitors, who may feel obliged to develop
six-speed boxes of their own. 'We'll be ahead, and theirs won't be a novelty
any more,' says Malara.
