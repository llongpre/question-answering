<TEXT>     "The key of all success today was the three drivers we chose for that car,"
said Jacky Ickx, a six-time winner at Le Mans who serves as Mazda's consultant
team-manager.;    A Mercedes driven by Jean-Louis Schesser and Alain Ferte of
France and Germany's Jochen Mass was first from the sixth hour until the 21st.
But a water pump belt broke and affected the alternator. The team never
recovered.; ANDRETTI DARES TO WIN: Michael Andretti, driving a backup car,
dashed from the fourth position to the lead at the outset of the race and led
all but two laps en route to a victory in a 200-mile Indy-car race in
Portland, Ore.;    Emerson Fittipaldi, who was on the pole and finished 4.5
seconds behind Andretti, was dumbfounded by the move Andretti made to pass him
and Rick Mears.;    "The gap between my car and Rick's was very small,"
Fittipaldi said. "I don't know how Michael did it.";    Fittipaldi fell behind
by as many as 17 seconds but narrowed the gap to less than 2 1/2 seconds when
Andretti had trouble for several laps trying to get around Scott Pruett midway
through the race.; ALLISON NO FLUKE: Davey Allison, leading 104 of 200 laps,
won a 400-mile NASCAR Cup race in Brooklyn, Mich.;    Allison was awarded his
second win of the year two weeks ago, at Sears Point in Sonoma, when Ricky
Rudd was penalized for bumping him aside two laps from the end.; ETC.: Kenny
Bernstein (Top Fuel), Jim White (Funny Car) and Darrell Alderman (Pro Stock)
were winners at a National Hot Rod Association event in St. Pie, Quebec. . . .
Danny Olmstead, fourth after 19 laps, capitalized on breakdowns by Terry
McCarl and Tom Henry to move into second place and then passed Scott Luhdorff
to win the feature sprint-car race Saturday at San Jose Fairgrounds Speedway.  </TEXT>
