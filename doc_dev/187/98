   Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan worked
together to design and produce the 1990 Plymouth Laser RS Turbo and
its twin, the Mitsubishi Eclipse GS. The result is a fine example of
joint workmanship that young, single car buyers can enjoy.
   The Laser test car was expressive, from its sporty design to its
leave-others-in-the-dust turbo engine.
   It was, as Car and Driver magazine said in naming it one of the
10 best cars this year, a modestly priced sports coupe with enough
performance to embarrass a Porsche 944.
   Slip down into the Laser RS driver's seat and examine the
cockpit-like dashboard arrayed in front. Notice how the right side
of the dash curves out and around, toward the driver. Knobs, buttons
and dials are all around. Shift a bit in the seat to rest your right
arm on the thick center console that houses the smooth-shifting
five-speed gearbox. Don't worry about the cigarette lighter that's
also on the console next to you. The lighter has a collar around it
so it won't depress casually.
   Now, push in the clutch and start up the car. Don't let the
relative quiet from under the hood fool you. This is a car with a
2-liter, turbocharged, 16-valve engine that's deceptively quick and
really fun. Thank heavens the companies installed passive shoulder
belts in the car for front-seat passengers who might be caught
unaware. The sporty front seats, too, help hold a body in place.
   In he first five months of sales since its January debut,
Chrysler sold about 6,000 Lasers. But company spokeswoman Rebecca
Caruso noted there are enough back orders to keep the assembly plant
in Normal, Ill., going at its current pace until November 1990,
though production at that Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant known as
Diamond-Star Motors will crank up with time and should shorten that
waiting list.
   The new Laser, which isn't related to an earlier Plymouth Laser
that was in dealer showrooms until 1986, is designed for young
adults with median age of 29 and college education, Caruso said.
Sixty-five percent will be single. More than half of the Laser
buyers are expected to be females.
   But the RS Turbo version is likely to attract more men than
women, Caruso said, adding that the Laser comes in two trim levels
and with three engine offerings, a smaller, 1.8-liter, non-turbo
engine, a 2-liter engine with no turbo and the top-of-the-ine
2-liter turbo that was in the test car.
   Base price of the Laser RS turbo was $13,394, making it quite
competitive in the small, sporty coupe market that includes the Ford
Probe GT, Mazda MX6 and Toyota Celica GT-S. The Probe GT, for
example, starts around $14,000, and the Celica GT-S starts around
$15,400.
   Caruso added that the Laser RS Turbo also is faster than the
competitors.
   From the outside, the Laser RS Turbo test car looked a lot like
the Probe _sloping and aerodynamic. Underneath is a modified
platform borrowed from another Mitsubishi car, the Gallant.
   Handling on the Laser was fine, and the suspension was not as
stiff as in other sporty cars. I would stress that buyers consider
whether they will use the Laser to carry more than one other
passenger with any regularity, because the Laser RS Turbo back seat
was made for a contortionist.
   Once I got in the back _ with a couple of bruises along the way _
my head was up against the ceiling, and I'm just 5-feet-4. The seat
does fold down, however, for more room in the hatchback area for
carrying non-human items.
   There were just a couple other drawbacks. The AM-FM
stereo-cassette player buttons were small and, therefore, had to be
hit with precision. And there was considerable torque steer with the
accelerator pushed down quickly _ especially when the car hit bumps
and uneven pavement.
   But those still didn't take the edge off all the fun. Because the
Laser RS Turbo is new for this year, Consumer Reports magazine does
not have owner reports of trouble.
