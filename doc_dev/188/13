   Rorer Group Inc. announced Tuesday
it will work jointly with the consumer products giant Procter &amp;
Gamble to develop and market prescription and over-the-counter
pharmaceutical products.
   The move comes one day after the suburban Philadelphia-based
company announced a $1.7 billion agreement to merge with the
pharmaceuticals operations of Rhone-Poulenc SA of Paris.
   The alliance between Rorer and Cincinatti-based Procter &amp; Gamble
gives Rorer a major worldwide distribution system for its main
product, the antacid Maalox. In addition to Maalox, Procter &amp;
Gamble obtains exclusive U.S. marketing and distribution rights to
Rorer's line of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, which include
Ascriptin and Perdiem.
   Rorer, which will continue to manufacture the drugs, will gain
rights to develop and market De-Nol, an anti-ulcer drug, and other
prescription gastrointestinal compounds that Procter &amp; Gamble has
been developing.
   Procter &amp; Gamble is still negotiating for international rights
to market and distribute some of Rorer's over-the-counter
pharmaceuticals.
   Rorer will retain ownership of its brands, while Procter &amp;
Gamble will receive royalty payments for the prescription products.
Both companies will share in the growth of the business.
   ``P&amp;G gains entry into a core over-the-counter category with a
leading antacid brand with no major upfront capital investment,''
Procter &amp; Gamble Chairman Edwin L. Artzt said in a statement.
   Rorer Chairman Robert E. Cawthorn said the alliance ``further
promotes Rorer's strategic objective of becoming a world-class
pharmaceutical company through research, internal growth and
business alliances.''
   ``This agreement maximizes the potential of Maalox,'' he said.
``Maalox and our other over-the-counter products will gain wider
distribution by utilizing Procter &amp; Gamble's extensive distribution
system.''
   Samuel D. Isaly, of Mehta &amp; Isaly pharmaceutical specialists,
said the deal ``is a lovely transaction'' for both companies.
   ``In the hands of Rorer, Maalox had a pretty bad future,'' he
said.
   New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson &amp; Johnson has heavily
advertised a competing antacid, Mylanta, he said, and the
government is considering allowing a variety of prescription ulcer
drugs to be sold over the counter.
   With Procter &amp; Gamble's better distribution system, Maalox will
be more competitive, he said.
   As for Procter &amp; Gamble, ``this gives them an extra brand name
they can promote,'' said Isaly, who noted the company already
distributes Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol.
   Under Tuesday's agreement, Procter &amp; Gamble also has received
the rights to purchase Rorer's over-the-counter pharmaceutical
company if Rorer decides to sell it.
   ``That's pretty important,'' said Ron Nordmann of PaineWebber
Group Inc. ``It is perhaps an indication that the newly-formed
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer might want to focus more on prescription drugs
and research.''
   Igor Landau, president of Rhone-Poulenc's health sector, said
the agreement with Procter &amp; Gamble is consistent with the newly
combined Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.'s strategy of developing and
strengthening its U.S. market.
   Access to U.S. markets was considered a major reason for the
merger with Rorer. Although Rhone-Poulenc is in the top 10 in the
European pharmaceutical market, it had no direct marketing in the
United States or Japan.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, with sales of $21.4 billion last year,
manufactures and markets health care products as well as a wide
range of laundry and cleaning products, personal care products,
food and beverage products.
   Rorer Group Inc. had $1.2 billion in 1989 sales.
   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. is expected to have annual sales
exceeding $3 billion.
   That merger will progress in stages, with Rhone-Poulenc
eventually obtaining 68 percent of Rorer by June 1990. In exchange,
Rorer will take on $265 million of Rhone-Poulenc debt and acquire
the French group's existing U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary for $20
million.
