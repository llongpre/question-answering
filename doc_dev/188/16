<TEXT>     Under the deal, announced at Procter &amp; Gamble headquarters in Cincinnati,
the company is acquiring Max Factor's product lines, including the Almay brand
of hypoallergenic cosmetics and Max Factor makeup.;    The division has annual
sales of about $621 million, with about 75 percent of that amount coming from
overseas business.;    Betrix is a cosmetics company with annual sales of
about $200 million.;    The two operations combined represent about 30 percent
of Revlon's annual sales.;    Procter &amp; Gamble is also acquiring manufacturing
plants in Japan, Britain, Germany and Mexico.;    Revlon, headed by Ronald O.
Perelman, has been trying to sell assets since early this year, with Procter &amp;
Gamble and L'Oreal rumored to be the most interested of several potential
buyers.;    The company has been deeply in debt since Perelman acquired it in
1985 through his privately held Pantry Pride Inc. Revlon's cash flow has been
hurt by the recession and the high costs of marketing cosmetics.;    Perelman
has already sold a stake in Revlon's National Health Laboratories subsidiary
to help reduce the company's debt load.;    Proceeds from the sale announced
today could help Revlon meet an estimated $816 million in loan payments due
next year.;    The sale of Max Factor and Betrix leaves Revlon much smaller
than L'Oreal and Estee Lauder, its two major U.S. rivals.;    But it boosts
Procter &amp; Gamble's cosmetics holdings. The company already owns Cover Girl,
the leading brand of mass-market cosmetics, with an estimated 23 percent of
the market. Adding Max Factor and Almay gives it a 30 percent share.;   
Procter &amp; Gamble also markets a wide range of food, health, cleaning and
toiletry products, with such well-known brands as Pampers diapers,
Pepto-Bismol stomach remedies, Head and Shoulders shampoo and Folgers coffee.;
   Besides Revlon, Perelman's holdings include Coleman Co. Inc., the camping
equipment manufacturer; New World Entertainment Inc., producer of the
television show "The Wonder Years"; comic book publisher Marvel Entertainment
Group Inc.; and several savings and loans institutions.; P&amp;G; ...;  HQ
