   A federal jury ruled that Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s Huggies brand disposable diapers didn't violate a Procter &amp; Gamble Co. patent when an elastic waist was added to the product. 

   The verdict by the six-person panel, which came after 10 hours of deliberation, wasn't a surprise. 
Analysts had considered the suit, filed in 1985, as just another salvo in the continuing "diaper wars" between the two rival companies, which dominate the $3 billion-a-year market for disposable diapers. 
P&amp;G's Pampers and Luvs brands command about half of the market, and Kimberly-Clark's Huggies hold about a third. 

   P&amp;G, a consumer products maker, alleged that Kimberly-Clark unlawfully used a method of elasticizing its diaper waists with heat shrinking material. 
P&amp;G sought to block Kimberly-Clark from further alleged infringement on the patent, and asked for unspecified damages. 
Kimberly-Clark countered that it hadn't violated rights of the patent and that the patent, granted to Raychem Corp. in 1972, wasn't valid. 
Raychem sold the patent, which expires in two years, to P&amp;G in 1983. 
In a countersuit filed last year, Kimberly-Clark, a maker of household, personal care and healthcare products, charged P&amp;G with trying to monopolize the disposable diaper market. 

   In Cincinnati, a P&amp;G spokesman said: "We are clearly disappointed with the jury's finding in Dallas. 
We are considering our options." 
He declined to elaborate.
