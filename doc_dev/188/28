   Kimberly-Clark Corp., eager to build its share of the
disposable diaper market, is introducing a new line of
Huggies diapers.
   Huggies Baby Steps will replace the existing Huggies line
and offer more sizes, increased absorbency and better fit,
according to a company spokeswoman.

   The move is likely to escalate promotional and advertising
spending between Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark and archrival
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., makers of Pampers and Luvs. P&amp;G is in
the process of a national launch of Pampers Phases, a diaper
that comes in seven different sizes.
   Kimberly-Clark, unlike P&amp;G, skipped the test-market stage
and will ship the new product to retailers in the Western
U.S. in October. Kimberly-Clark will take only "a period of
months" before expanding the product to the rest of the
states, the spokeswoman said.
   What remains to be seen is whether all these improvements
do anything to change the two companies' market shares.
Huggies has about 33% of the market, followed by Pampers' 26%
and Luvs 22%, according to estimates from Salomon Brothers.
