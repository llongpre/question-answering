   New industry-sponsored research suggests that cloth
diapers may increase the risk of diarrhea outbreaks in
day-care centers, a finding that could imperil legislation to
encourage cloth diaper use.
   The study was funded in large part by Procter &amp; Gamble
Co., whose Luvs and Pampers hold about 50% of the $3.5
billion-a-year U.S. disposable-diaper business. It was
conducted by researchers at University of Texas Medical
School in Houston.

   Environmental groups have pressed state legislatures for
over a year to lift restrictions on cloth diapers in day-care
centers, charging that throw-away products are clogging
landfills. About eight states are considering legislation to
permit cloth diapers in day-care centers where health worries
earlier had prompted cloth-diaper bans.
   The new study is the most recent action by disposable
diaper companies to fend off legislation favoring cloth
diapers. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies, lobbied
against a proposed law in Wisconsin that would have taxed
disposables. And Procter &amp; Gamble funded a controversial
study that concluded that cloth diapers can be as
environmentally damaging as disposables. "P&amp;G has a real
concern about these laws," said Bonita Austin, an analyst
with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., New York.
   The new Texas study, published in this week's issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, found a
significant increase in the amount of diarrhea-causing germs
on a variety of surfaces -- such as toys and changing pads --
when several day-care centers used cloth diapers.
   Researchers suggested that diarrhea-causing germs, which
reside in feces, can escape from cloth diapers more readily
than from disposables. Previous research said the risk of
contracting diarrhea is about three times higher for infants
at a day-care center than at home. Those previous studies
suggested that bacteria was spread by careless hygiene
practices and that diarrhea outbreaks could be reduced if
day-care workers took greater care to wash their hands after
changing diapers.
   The new study didn't find any actual increase in diarrhea
outbreaks when cloth diapers were used. Larry Pickering, who
led the research, said the study was too small to find a
difference in outbreaks, only an increase in bacterial
contamination.
   Dr. Pickering has conducted numerous studies of diarrhea
among infants. In an interview, he acknowledged that Procter
&amp; Gamble provided about $80,000 for the study, about 80% of
its cost. The company's support for the research wasn't noted
by the researchers in the published report. "The company
helped pay for the study, but that didn't affect the way we
carried it out," Dr. Pickering said.
