<HEAD>Procter and Gamble Agrees to Sell Cheboygan Plant</HEAD>

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. says it will sell
its northern Michigan paper factory and drop production of the
tissue used in disposable diapers.
   Mosinee Paper Corp. of Wisconsin has agreed in principle to buy
the Cheboygan factory, Procter &amp; Gamble plant Manager Phil Baker
said Monday.
   The plant manufactures the tissue paper that wraps around the
absorbent stuffing of disposable diapers, and also makes liners for
underwear and incontinent briefs. About a third of the plant's
production is devoted to diaper tissue, Baker said.
   The Cheboygan plant employs 305 people. It employed as many as
700 people 10 years ago, when P&amp;G manufactured Pampers diapers
there.
   The company wanted to sell the plant and transfer the
manufacture of its liners and briefs to other P&amp;G plants, said
spokeswoman Sue Hale at corporate headquarters in Cincinnati.
   ``There are some savings in distribution, overhead and such
costs,'' she said of the planned sale. ``It was purely an economic
move.''
   The company will stop making the tissue for diapers altogether,
buying it on the open market instead. ``Basically we were able to
identify a supplier that we could obtain the tissue from at a
savings,'' Hale said.
   Baker said design changes over the years have reduced the amount
of tissue needed in each diaper, reducing demand and making it
cheaper to buy than make.
   Mosinee, which produces industrial tissue and towel products and
specialty papers, uses different raw materials and sells to a
different market, Baker said.
   The sale will be final in March 1990 but P&amp;G will continue
manufacturing there until the fall of 1990, Baker said. No sale
price was disclosed.
   The sale hinges on Mosinee reaching a labor agreement with the
United Paperworkers International union, which has a contract with
P&amp;G that expires this fall. No negotiations have begun.
   Before the sale is final, Mosinee also must receive state
permits to discharge treated water into the Cheboygan River.
   The paper mill opened in 1906 and has had a long succession of
owners, including the Simplicity Pattern Co. and the Charmin Paper
Co.
