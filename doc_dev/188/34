   NEW YORK -- When a growth stock falters, investors find it
hard to forgive and forget.
   That's what happened to Procter &amp; Gamble's stock. It
tripped in the past year after a long stellar performance and
everybody started taking potshots at it.

   But lately, with investors turning back to consumer stocks
again, some people have cast a kinder eye on Procter &amp;
Gamble. The Cincinnati titan's chairman, Edwin Artzt, is
fighting hard to defend the company's diapers and detergents
from competitors' assaults, analysts say.
   With help from new kinds of Pampers diapers, Crest
toothpaste pumps and Tide detergent they expect the company
to show improved profit some time next year; indeed, after a
tough fiscal 1991 they say Procter &amp; Gamble can hardly help
looking better next year. Meanwhile, they're hoping for a
nice surprise: though the company denies it, many people
think it will sell parts of its stodgy food business, a drag
on profit.
   Yesterday, Procter &amp; Gamble reported uninspiring results
for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30. Per-share profit
was 83 cents, up from 78 cents a year earlier.
   "People may be thinking the worst is already reflected" in
Procter &amp; Gamble's stock, says Alice Beebe Longley, a
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst. This week she reaffirmed
her enthusiasm for the stock and she declares: "I'm in favor
of buying before everybody thinks this is a stock they have
to own."
   In recent weeks, Procter &amp; Gamble has been zipping along
with more popular consumer stocks. It touched 83 1/8 this
week, before slipping to 81 1/4, down 1, yesterday. In late
June, it dipped as low as 77 1/4 after months of wretched
performance that left it trailing the broad market. As long
as investors are unsure when the economy will recover, big,
stable consumer stocks "are a good place to hide," says
Oppenheimer's market analyst Michael Metz.
   Procter &amp; Gamble may not be a stock for anyone who wants
to see a surge in profit in the next couple of quarters. But
a few long-term investors who think the stock has been
punished enough have bought it recently. ("They used to love
it, now they think it's a big ugly stock that's been hurt
enough" says one holder, a New York money manager.) And one
bear who was targeting Procter &amp; Gamble for another fall
concedes that he recently backed off.
   Today, Procter &amp; Gamble's stock is actually about 6% lower
than it was at the end of 1990; the Dow Jones equity market
index is about 19% higher. And because Procter &amp; Gamble's
double-digit growth has faltered, its stock is perhaps
deservedly cheaper than sexier consumer shares. Currently, it
sells for about 14.5 times estimated 1992 profit, using
Kidder Peabody's estimate for calendar 1992. Coca-Cola has a
price-earnings ratio of more than 20.
   A Procter &amp; Gamble spokesman says, "Did you notice our
profit was up 11%?" for fiscal 1991. He adds: "Given the
recessionary environment in the past six months to a year,
and given our strong spending on new-product initiatives, we
feel good about our current numbers."
   Analysts generally expect Procter &amp; Gamble to earn about
$5.30 a primary share in the fiscal year ending in June 1992.
Though the Street's consensus calls for about $5.75 a share
the following year, bulls expect a much bigger fiscal 1993
jump.
   The company's problems haven't gone away. In its best
businesses it is fighting a costly and unending war for a
bigger share of consumers' dollars. It has had to spend
heavily to defend its soaps against those of giants such as
Unilever and its diapers against Kimberly-Clark's. And in its
food business, where it isn't such a dominant player, the
company is plagued by competitors' price-cutting.
   New products are expensive to launch. "You're looking at a
company that spends $2 billion-plus a year on marketing,"
says Merrill Lynch analyst Deepak Raj. Procter &amp; Gamble's
latest offering, recently launched in Midwestern markets, is
seven different sized diapers for different sized babies; the
company won't say how much they cost to roll out. The
company's less-fattening fat substitute Olestra, which isn't
even on the market yet, so far has cost more than $180
million to develop, according to Prudential Securities.
   New York money manager Martin Sosnoff of Atalanta/Sosnoff
Capital foresees no end in coming years to the multinational
consumer companies' costly war for market share. He cut back
his Procter &amp; Gamble holding this year and says bluntly:
"It's a boring stock." For many big consumer companies,
including some in Atalanta/Sosnoff's portfolio, he thinks the
brightest years may be over.
   Some Procter &amp; Gamble fans say they won't get back into
the stock until they see stronger profit or hear good news
about the food business, which some people value at $2
billion or more. Product brands include Folger's coffee,
Hawaiian Punch, Pringles, Duncan Hines, Crisco and Citrus
Hill orange juice.
   At a big money management firm that unloaded about one
million Procter &amp; Gamble shares earlier this year, an analyst
says: "In six months time, I'll take another look at the
stock." The company "can sell some product lines, maybe
orange juice, and turn some around," he suggests; that way,
it can show it's "serious" about getting back onto a growth
track.
   But if the U.S. market is tough, Procter &amp; Gamble is going
gangbusters overseas. It gets almost 30% of total operating
profit abroad and is growing faster there than many U.S.
consumer companies, says Merrill's Mr. Raj. Foreign profit,
up 13% in fiscal 1991, could help the whole company to grow
faster in future years, analysts say. Back home, Procter &amp;
Gamble's profit from operations for fiscal 1991 edged up a
meager 4%.
   Says Donaldson Lufkin's Ms. Longley: "Overseas, they have
terrific momentum."
