   The way a mother covers her baby's bottom has
become a matter of government concern. Legislation that would ban,
restrict or discourage the use of disposable diapers is being
considered in a dozen or so states. The environment is at stake,
proponents say. Mothers would be the big losers, corn farmers
perhaps the big winners.

   It was test marketed in 1961 in, where else,
Peoria, Ill.
   And, oh, how it played.
   The disposable diaper. In the years since, it has been improved:
elasticized legs, gels, super absorbency, the anatomically more
efficient his and hers versions.
   It has become a $3.5 billion-a-year industry, with 85 percent of
America's mothers using them.
   But the disposable diaper has become a prime target of angry
environmentalists who consider it the very symbol of the ills of a
throwaway society. The problem is what to do with it once it has
done its job. Throwaway diapers clog up the waste stream.
   The way a mother covers her baby's bottom has become a subject
of hot debate in statehouses and city halls. It has generated piles
of studies, reports and pamphlets. Who would have thought the
manufacturers of disposable diapers would have to go to such
lengths to defend such a wonder product?
   Bills either to ban, restrict or tax disposable diapers are
before the legislatures of about a dozen states.
   On the other hand, the controversy has breathed new life into
the diaper service business, and could prove a boon to corn farmers.
   The rub is, although disposable diapers account for only 2
percent of the nation's trash, they will last 500 years in a
landfill. One proposed solution is the more-expensive biodegradable
diaper, and that's where the corn farmers come in.
   Jeanne Wirka, a solid-waste reduction expert with the
Environmental Action Foundation, says the disposable diaper is the
largest single one-use product for which there is a readily
available alternative _ cloth diapers.
   But the convenience factor is extraordinary. Many day care
centers, for example, will not accept youngsters in cloth diapers.
   And if everyone switched to cloth tomorrow, there would be
chaos. There are not enough cloth diapers nor cloth diaper services
in the country to accommodate them. In environmentally hip
Washington, D.C., 400 people are on the waiting list for the one
diaper service in town.
   The National Association of Diaper Services, after years of
decline, reports a 38 percent increase in business last year and a
13 percent rise the year before. The disposable diaper giants,
however, say they see no blip yet on their sales screen.
   The debate has produced strange bedfellows. The six most active
environmental groups and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark
Corp., the disposable diaper manufacturers who control 75 percent
of the market, agree that biodegradable diapers are not the answer.
   The environmentalists called for a boycott of degradable diapers
in mid-December, saying their use only assuages the conscience of
consumers who use them. Biodegradable diapers don't decompose in
landfills because there is not enough moisture or oxygen, they say.
   Taking an opposing view is the National Association of Corn
Growers, based in St. Louis. Cornstarch is used in the degradables
and this could open up a market of 150 million to 300 million
bushels a year for the nation's corn farmers, spokesman Tim Draeger
says.
   So far, the only state to enact any legislation has been
Nebraska, which passed a law last session requiring the use of
biodegradables by 1993. Nebraska, it might be noted, is the
nation's third-largest corn producing state, just behind Iowa and
Illinois.
   Draeger argues that if the biodegradable diaper technology was
improved, it would mean America would be less dependent on foreign
oil.
   ``We are in the infancy of this technology,'' he says. ``We are
at the Model T level. We have to learn to walk before we can run.''
   Ms. Wirka says that's plain silly. The amount of ``foreign oil''
in diapers is negligible and the so-called degradables also use
some.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble, with a $1.65 billion slice of
the disposable pie _ compared to Kimberly-Clark's $840 million _
has taken a much higher profile in its fight to keep baby's bottom
in Pampers and Luvs, its products.
   Although close-mouthed about the money it is spending on the
diaper wars, P&amp;G is sponsoring two well-publicized projects, one in
Seattle demonstrating that plastic diapers can be recycled and
another in St. Cloud, Minn., showing diapers can be composted. The
Seattle project is reputed to be a $500,000 venture.
   ``If you could throw that kind of money at every segment of the
trash problem in America, we wouldn't have a trash problem,'' says
Jeffrey Tryens of the Council for Policy Alternatives, a
Washington-based environmental group. ``It's just good PR for
Procter and Gamble.''
   Wirka, however, thinks the St. Cloud project may have some
merit, although she says, ``That recycling project is just bogus.
   ``Procter &amp; Gamble is in a difficult position. They are always
the target here and they are applying their corporate good guy
image on something that is economically very dubious. I'm more
willing to say that the composting project is a more fruitful use
of their resources.''
   P&amp;G, it should be noted, has been a leader in recycling plastic
bottles for its products, selling refills for the same plastic
bottle and marketing concentrates in smaller bottles where the
consumer just needs to add water. Its soaps are also biodegradable.
   Since the diaper wars started making the nightly news shows,
politicians have gotten bolder. Tryens says he called a meeting
about a year ago, inviting legislators, lobbyists,
environmentalists and others concerned about the issue.
   ``At that time, nobody even considered discussing a statewide
ban,'' he says. ``The feeling was that no respectable politician
would even propose such legislation and that it just wouldn't fly.''
   Yet, one year later, the state of Vermont is proposing just such
legislation as part of a much larger environmental bill. If passed,
no disposable diapers would be sold in Vermont after 1993.
   Nancy Alexander of New Haven, Conn., is one who's profiting by
it all. She started her own cloth diaper service in January and
says clients are flocking to her door.
   ``I've always wanted to go into my own business and this just
sort of fell into my lap,'' she says. ``What's more is that all of
my clients treat me like I'm some kind of a hero.''
   One of her clients with a newborn baby said her 4-year-old was
watching her change the baby with a disposable diaper and had a
quizzical look on her face.
   ``What is it?'' asked the mother.
   ``Why don't they invent a diaper you could just wash and use
over and over?'' asked the child.
