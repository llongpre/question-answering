   CINCINNATI -- A Procter &amp; Gamble Co. advertisement on
composting disposable diapers has been challenged as
deceptive under New York City's consumer protection laws.
   The charges continue the battle against disposable
diapers, which have been tagged as one of the culprits in the
nation's trash problem.

   New York City's consumer affairs department says P&amp;G's
advertisement, which appeared in TV Guide, promotes the
company's Luvs and Pampers brands as easily compostable, but
few consumers actually have access to such composting
facilities.
   The ad shows a pile of soil-like material that was once a
disposable diaper before the 90-day process began. The ad
states that nearly 80% of the diaper is compostable. The
process needed to break down the disposable diapers is called
"accelerated composting," which speeds up the natural
degrading of materials. To date, 10 communities are
composting their trash, according to the ad.
   In a letter to P&amp;G, the consumer affairs department
requested that the company meet with it March 22 to discuss
the violations and, presumably, to negotiate suspension of
the advertising. The letter didn't specify what actions the
department could take. Under, New York law, the department
could fine and seek an end to the ad campaign.
   In Cincinnati, a P&amp;G spokeswoman said the company
disagrees with the allegations and doesn't believe the ad is
misleading. The ad "is intended to help educate consumers
about the potential promise" of municipal composting and to
encourage its development, the spokeswoman said.
   P&amp;G, which controls about 50% of the U.S. disposable
diaper market, has been testing new diaper materials and
disposal methods for soiled diapers. Last year, P&amp;G said it
would spend $20 million to help develop municipal composting
projects around the world.
