   A tissue paper factory that prospered on
the business of disposable diapers will close Friday, giving way to
other factories that can make the same product more cheaply.
   Procter &amp; Gamble's Paper Products Co. has been phasing down the
Cheboygan tissue paper plant since May 1989. At that time, the
company announced it would buy instead of make the absorbent paper
that goes into its Pampers diapers and Always adult panty liners.
The tissue was one of the main production lines at the Cheboygan
plant.
   Plant Manager Phil Baker said Thursday five other companies
expressed an interest in buying the plant and two still are
talking.
   ``It's not possible for us to be too optimistic yet. They've
visited the plant. They've looked at the equipment. But they are
trying to sort through what products they would make on this
equipment,'' Baker said.
   In 1989, Procter &amp; Gamble had 300 people working at the
Cheboygan factory. By Thursday, 130 of them had transferred to
other Procter &amp; Gamble operations around the country. Another 75 as
of Friday will be retired, Baker said.
   The closing of the 86-year-old plant robs Cheboygan of its
biggest employer.
