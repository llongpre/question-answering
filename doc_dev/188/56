The European Commission is to hold a full investigation into the acquisition
by Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, of Vereinigte
Papierwerke Schickedanz, a subsidiary of the German partnership Gustav und
Grete Schickedanz, it was announced in Brussels yesterday.
The commission will consider whether the acquisition by Procter &amp; Gamble
GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Procter &amp; Gamble, breaches the
Commission's competition rules in the European market for female sanitary
protection.
The Commission inquiry follows a preliminary investigation into the
implications of the acquisition for the European markets in diapers and
feminine protection.
Procter &amp; Gamble has promised to divest VPS's baby diaper business and part
of its feminine protection business to comply witb EU competition rules.
But the Commission remained concerned the moves still left Procter &amp; Gamble
in breach of EU competition rules in the sanitary-towel sector of the
feminine protection market, not least because Procter &amp; Gamble would acquire
VPS's leading sanitary-towel brand in Germany, the commission said.
'Whether the geographic market concerned is national or EEA-wide, the
combined market shares of Procter &amp; Gamble and VPS raise serious doubts as
to the operation's compatibility with the Common Market,' the Commission
said.
It pointed out that factors such as consumer brand loyalty, high promotion
costs and the strength of Procter &amp; Gamble in branded consumer products
meant there were already significant barriers to market entry.
The key task for the commission now would be to define the feminine
protection market, especially if it was national or European in nature, Mr
Bruno Julien, commission spokesman said.
Under EU rules the investigation will take up to four months.
