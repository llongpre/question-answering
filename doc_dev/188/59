   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the consumer products powerhouse, will
enter the rough-and-tumble world of women's cosmetics with its $1.3
billion acquisition of Noxell Corp., maker of the No. 1 Cover Girl
cosmetics line.
   The stock-swap deal announced Friday, which was approved
unanimously by the boards of both companies, also will add Noxell's
Noxzema skin cream, Clarion makeup and Lestoil household cleaner to
bulging P&amp;G arsenal of megabrands.
   The consolidating cosmetics industry already had grabbed the
spotlight this year. This summer Unilever, the British-Dutch
consumer giant, completed a $1.55 billion acquisition of the Faberge
and Elizabeth Arden lines of cosmetics and toiletries. Following
that deal, Avon Products Inc. successfully rebuffed takeover
overtures from rival door-to-door marketer Amway Corp.
   The Procter &amp; Gamble merger announcement sent Noxell soaring $10
to $31.25 Friday in over-the-counter trading. On the New York Stock
Exchange, P&amp;G fell $2 to $119.87{.
   Under terms of the agreement, P&amp;G will exchange 0.272 shares of
its common stock for each of Noxell's 40.5 million common and class
B shares in a tax-free transaction. Based on the closing price for
P&amp;G, the transaction would have a value of $32.60 per Noxell share.
   Noxell, based in Hunt Valley, Md., will be operated as a P&amp;G
unit. The 75-year-old company has 2,200 employees and annual revenue
of roughly $522 million from sales in the United States, Canada and
Europe.
   Analysts applauded the move as strategically sound. While P&amp;G has
a number of successful skin care products, including Oil of Olay,
Bain de Soleil and Clearasil, it has no cosmetics lines.
   ``P&amp;G has done a lot of work in skin care technology ... and this
will add another leg to their delivery systems,'' said Jay Freedman
of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   He said Cover Girl is the No. 1 mass market cosmetics line in the
United States.
   For its part, Noxell was attracted by P&amp;G's resources for
research and development. Last year P&amp;G spent more than $650 million
on research and product development.
   In addition, P&amp;G can add ``international marketing support which
should enhance the long-term growth of these brands,'' said John
Smale, P&amp;G's chairman and chief executive.
   Noxell Chairman and Chief Executive George Bunting Jr. said in a
statement, ``An association with the right company appeared the
ideal way to achieve this, and Procter &amp; Gamble is clearly the right
company.''
   P&amp;G, which is based in Cincinnati, reported worldwide sales of
$21.4 billion last year. Among its brands are Ivory soap, Crest
toothpaste, Pampers and Luvs disposable diapers, Tide laundry
detergent, Duncan Hines cookies, Folgers coffee, Crisco cooking oil
and Pringles potato chips.
   Known for its slow but steady approach to business, P&amp;G has had a
healthy appetite for acquisitions this decade.
   Since 1981, the company has spent more than $3 billion buying up
stakes in 16 companies worldwide. Among its larger deals, P&amp;G
acquired Richardson-Vicks International, maker of Vaporub, Vicks
cough drops and Formula 44, in 1985 for $1.2 billion.
   That same year the company acquired G.D. Searle's
over-the-counter pharmaceuticals business for more than $300
million, adding to its battery of health-care products that includes
Pepto-Bismol and Metamucil fiber supplement.
   Like other P&amp;G buyouts, the Noxell deal was forged as a friendly
transaction. P&amp;G does not plan any immediate, significant changes at
Noxell, although some employee relocations may become necessary.
   The merger is subject to approval by Noxell shareholders, the
Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Approval by P&amp;G shareholders is not required because the company
has sufficient numbers of authorized stock shares not yet issued to
provide the merger basis, P&amp;G spokesman William Dobson said.
   The merger should be completed by year's end, Dobson said.
