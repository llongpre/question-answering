   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. today reported a 22.1
percent jump in its fourth-quarter profit as the costs of closing
and consolidating some operations were more than offset by income
gains from higher unit sales.
   For the three months ended June 30, the consumer products giant
said income rose to $171 million, or 99 cents a share, up from $140
million, or 82 cents a share, in the prior year's final quarter.
Sales grew 9.2 percent to $5.4 billion from $4.98 billion of a year
earlier.
   Investors reacted positively to Procter &amp; Gamble's results. The
stock surged $4.25 to $122.25 a share in early trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The quarterly income was reduced by an after-tax provision of
$78 million to cover the closing of a Chicago plant and some other
U.S. operating departments as part of P&amp;G's effort to consolidate
manufacturing operations.
   But profit from higher unit volumes in the fourth quarter
compared with the year before more than compensated for the
negative impact that the one-time costs had on earnings, the
company said.
   For the entire year, Procter &amp; Gamble earned $1.21 billion, or
$7.12 a share, an 18 percent gain from $1.02 billion, or $5.96 a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose 10.7 percent to $21.4 billion
from $19.34 billion.
   P&amp;G Chairman and Chief Executive John G. Smale and President
John E. Pepper said in a joint statement that they were
``reasonably pleased '' with the past year's results, while noting
that the long-term development of their businesses was more
important than a single year's performance.
   ``As we enter the 1990s, our objective is to build on the
momentum generated within the company during the past few years and
to rise to the challenge of the more highly competitive markets we
will face in the coming decade,'' the executives said in a news
release.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, makes and sells a wide
range of soaps, laundry detergents, cleaning agents, personal-care
products including pharmaceuticals, food and beverage items and
other products for commercial use.
