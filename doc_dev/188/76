   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it has closed its
general office and one of its two manufacturing plants in Manila
because of fighting between Philippines government troops and rebel
soldiers.
   The plant in the Makati area near Manila's financial district _
the scene of fighting _ was closed Monday, Procter &amp; Gamble
spokeswoman Kelly Gillespie said. The plant produces P&amp;G's
Richardson-Vicks products.
   P&amp;G's general office in Manila was closed Friday.
   ``The plan is for the plant and the general office to remain
closed until further notice,'' said spokesman Patrick Hayes at P&amp;G
headquarters in Cincinnati. ``The good news is that none of our
employees has been harmed in any way and, as of yesterday, there
was no damage to our property.''
   P&amp;G's main soap and detergent plant in Manila, in the Tondo area
about 15 miles from the financial district, continued to operate,
spokesmen said.
   Hayes said P&amp;G has about 1,200 employees at its Manila
facilities, all of them Philippine nationals except for four
Americans.
