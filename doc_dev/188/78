   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Cincinnati, and Gist-brocades N.V., of Delft, the Netherlands, said they signed a licensing agreement that gives P&amp;G rights to manufacture and market De-Nol, a Gist-brocades gastrointestinal prescription drug, in North America. 

   Specific terms of the agreement were not disclosed. 
P&amp;G said the marketing and manufacture of the drug is subject to approval of the Food and Drug Administration. 

   De-Nol is a bismuth-containing product that controls a bacterium that reseachers believe causes gastritis and ulcers. 
P&amp;G said the product would complement its other bismuth-containing product, Pepto-Bismol, which is sold over the counter.
