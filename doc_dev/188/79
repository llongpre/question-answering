Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said today that it plans to build a combined 
headquarters and technical center on Japan's Rokko Island, where a new city is 
being built along Osaka Bay.

Procter &amp; Gamble said the new building will consolidate headquarter 
functions now spread over five locations in Osaka and will be home for certain 
research and development functions now handled in the United States. The 
Cincinnati-based company said its decision to establish the research facility 
recognizes Japan as a major source of product and packaging technology for 
P&amp;G's worldwide business.
