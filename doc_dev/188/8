<HEAD>Maalox Maker Sues Pepto-Bismol Maker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The maker of Maalox is suing the maker of
Pepto-Bismol in a battle between stomach remedies.
   Rorer Pharmaceutical Corp. of Fort Washington, Pa., contends in
the suit filed in federal court in New York that Pepto-Bismol's
labeling, advertising and promotion are ``false and misleading.''
   In its suit, Rorer contends ``sweeping,'' unsubstantiated
statements by Pepto-Bismol's maker, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., have hurt
the sales and reputation of Maalox, Rorer's 40-year-old antacid.
   Rorer officials declined to estimate how much money they have
lost in sales, but the suit calls the sum ``substantial.''
   Teri Glover, a spokeswoman at Procter &amp; Gamble's headquarters in
Cincinnati, said the company had not seen the court papers and
could not comment.
   Procter &amp; Gamble acquired 88-year-old Pepto-Bismol in 1982 when
it bought Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, which also is named as a
defendant in the suit.
   Rorer's suit also alleges that a new Maximum Strength
Pepto-Bismol is being sold with a higher dosage than approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   In addition, Rorer said, it is disturbed that Procter &amp; Gamble
contends Pepto-Bismol treats a host of ailments, including
heartburn, indigestion, nausea and upset stomach.
   Rorer contends Pepto-Bismol is effective against only heartburn,
fullness and nausea caused specifically by overindulgence in food
and alcohol.
   ``The FDA has specifically found that Pepto-Bismol is not
effective for most of the claims for which it is promoted,'' said
the suit, filed Thursday.
   Brad Stone, an FDA spokesman, said the agency had no comment on
the suit.
   The Maalox line of over-the-counter antacids is the best-selling
antacid in the nation and the world. It had U.S. sales exceeding
$105 million last year, giving it about 15 percent of the market
for antacids, said Richard Driansky, a vice president and chief
counsel for Rorer, a division of Rorer Group Inc.
