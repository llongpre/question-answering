   John G. Smale announced Tuesday he was
resigning as chairman and chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
as part of a series of top-level personnel moves.
   Smale, 62, made the unexpected announcement to shareholders at
the consumer products giant's annual meeting, saying he wanted to
spend more time with his family. He has been the company's chief
executive for the last nine years and leaves office effective Jan.
2.
   Succeeding Smale as chairman and chief executive will be Edwin
L. Artzt, who now is vice chairman of the board and president of
Procter &amp; Gamble's international operations.
   Company president John E. Pepper will give up most of his
responsibilities for Procter &amp; Gamble's domestic operations to
oversee the international business.
   Smale announced the changes at a shareholders' meeting
punctuated by a demonstration by animal-rights activists. Several
dozen picketed outside the company's headquarters while others
questioned Smale during the meeting about Procter &amp; Gamble's use of
animals for product-safety testing.
   The company in recent years has been a target of animal rights
activists, but maintains that marketing certain products without
animal testing would be unsafe.
   Nine shareholders expressed concerns about animal testing
Tuesday to Smale, who declined to say how many animals are being
used in product testing. He said the company had reduced the number
of animals it uses by one-third in the past five years and will
continue seeking alternatives.
   Shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock split that will become
effective Oct. 20, increasing the authorized number of common
shares from 500 million to 1 billion.
   After resigning his executive position, Smale will remain a
Procter &amp; Gamble employee and will serve as a director and as
chairman of the board's executive committee.
   ``By January, I will have been president and then chairman of
Procter &amp; Gamble for nearly 16 years,'' Smale said. ``I will have
been the chief executive officer of the company for nine years.
I've reached the conclusion that for me as well as for my family
it's time to turn this responsibility over to someone else.''
   Smale has led the company into new product lines and oversaw an
$805 million reorganization two years ago aimed at streamlining
management. During Smale's tenure, the company acquired
Richardson-Vicks, some major brands from G.D. Searle, and Noxell
Corp. Those moves gave the personal care-products giant a wide base
in over-the-counter drugs and beauty products.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had sales of $21.4 billion in the fiscal year
ended June 30 and net earnings of $1.6 billion.
   Smale also helped the company branch out into foreign markets.
Roughly 39 percent of its sales in the last fiscal year were based
outside the United States, and Smale said the figure should top 50
percent in a few years.
   Artzt, 59, has been vice chairman of the board and president of
Procter &amp; Gamble International since 1984. His first major
promotion was in 1969 when he was named vice president of the food
products division.
   Procter &amp; Gamble also announced the selection of three vice
presidents to the posts of executive vice president.
   Group vice president B. Jurgen Hintz will be responsible for the
company's domestic paper products, cellulose and chemicals, and
food and beverage businesses; Durk I. Jager, also a group vice
president, will be responsible for domestic soap, detergent and
health and beauty care businesses; and Gerald V. Dirvin, senior
vice president, will continue to oversee most of P&amp;G's staff
functions, such as sales, advertising, marketing services and
public affairs.
