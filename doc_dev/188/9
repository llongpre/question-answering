   The Justice Department, suffering heartburn
over a plan by the maker of Pepto-Bismol to acquire the exclusive
sales rights for Maalox, filed suit Tuesday to stop the
stomach-remedy alliance.
   The Justice Department sought a court injunction under the
Clayton Anti-Trust Act to prevent Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which makes
Pepto-Bismol, from acquiring the exclusive rights to market and
distribute Maalox.
   Court papers filed in federal court in Philadelphia charged that
the proposed agreement between Procter &amp; Gamble and Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer Inc., which makes Maalox, would lessen competition in the
market of over-the-counter stomach remedies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, sold $125 million worth
of Pepto-Bismol last year, or 14 percent of the domestic retail
market. Domestic sales of Maalox totalled $111 million last year or
12 percent of the market.
   Under the proposal, Procter &amp; Gamble would acquire the exclusive
rights to market and sell Maalox and an option to purchase the
manufacturing assets from Rhone-Pulenc Rorer, which is based in Ft.
Washington, Pa. The deal would make Procter &amp; Gamble the largest
seller of stomach remedies in the U.S. market, according to the
complaint.
