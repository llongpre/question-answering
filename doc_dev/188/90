   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Cincinnati, said it settled a patent
infringement lawsuit against Whitehall Laboratories Inc.
involving P&amp;G's proprietary 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner
technology.
   The suit, filed on Oct. 25, 1990, in U.S. District Court
in Delaware, claimed that Whitehall Laboratories' "Denorex
Extra Strength with Conditioners" brand infringed on one of
P&amp;G's patents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Whitehall agreed to a consent judgment that P&amp;G's patent
is valid and enforceable. P&amp;G uses this technology, which
includes a conditioner in a shampoo, in several of its
hair-care products, including Pert Plus and Head &amp; Shoulders.
