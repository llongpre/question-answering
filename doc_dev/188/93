A proposal by Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) to require environmental warning 
labels on packages of disposable diapers died -- again -- when it failed to 
garner enough votes Tuesday in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. However, 
it could be brought up for reconsideration today. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted 8-7 to scuttle Killea's measure requiring a label on 
disposable diaper packages warning that "single-use disposable diapers create 
significant environmental problems and costs to the community when disposed." 
The bill would have required manufacturers to label diaper packages by Jan. 1, 
1992, or face a $50 fine per package. 
</P>
<P>
Killea's measure has received strong opposition from Proctor &amp; Gamble, the 
makers of Pampers disposables, and Kimberly-Clark, makers of Huggies, who claim 
the bill unfairly singles out disposable diapers as an environmental hazard. 
The companies have argued that the alternative being touted by Killea -- 
old-fashioned cloth diapers -- is even more environmentally offensive because 
they dirty six times more water during cleaning than disposable diapers, which 
are designed to be rinsed once before being thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole objective is to put a user of the product on a guilt trip," Gene 
Hill, Kimberly-Clark's regional director of state government relations, said 
about Killea's measure. 
</P>
<P>
Killea, however, says the water claims are exaggerated, and underscored to 
legislative colleagues Tuesday that her measure is not a tax or a ban. She said 
it is a way to educate consumers about the environmental consequences of 
disposable diapers, which account for 2% of the solid wastes generated each 
year by Californians. She says the 2.5 million single-use diapers thrown away 
annually by Californians would be enough to pave Interstate 5 from the Mexican 
border to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The conflicting claims prompted Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) to 
observe that the disposable diaper debate represented "two environmental 
problems coming to a loggerhead -- the disposal issue versus water use." 
O'Connell, considered sympathetic to recycling issues, represents 
drought-stricken Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Voting against the measure was Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), who 
claimed the Killea bill would also have required labels on incontinent supplies 
for the elderly. Diapers for the elderly are exactly the same product, only 
bigger, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The label proposal was killed in the Senate. But it was restored last month by 
another Assembly committee before being sent along in the legislative process. 
California is one of 25 states considering measures to label or ban disposable 
diapers.
