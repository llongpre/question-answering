   A leftist terrorist group today claimed
responsibility for a weekend rocket attack that damaged the offices
of a U.S. company.
   The November 17 group said it launched the Sunday attack against
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., a household products manufacturer, because it
recently bought a debt-ridden company from the government at a low
price.
   ``We will automatically consider such a move as robbing the
Greek people ... and consequently we will strike without warning,''
the group said in a letter to the Socialist daily Epikairotita.
   Authorities had already said they suspected November 17 in the
attack on an office of Cincinnati-based company. The building,
located on a main thoroughfare, was damaged but no one was injured.
   Officials said the attackers apparently used a stolen anti-tank
missile and a small World War II bazooka.
   The conservative Greek government elected in April says that it
plans to privatize or liquidate most of the 70 former private
companies operated by the state because they are losing about $1
billion annually. Labor unions have protested the move.
   Procter &amp; Gamble bought the property of a defunct Greek company
for $2.77 million at a public auction in May, said Gerassimos
Vassilatos, a company spokesman. The Greek company had a total debt
of $37.5 million, he said.
   ``Eight previous auctions failed to provoke any interest from
anybody else. The price, as a result, was lowered by the court to a
price that it considered appropriate,'' he said.
   He added that the Greek company had laid off its work force two
years ago and that the property would be used as a warehouse.
   Procter &amp; Gamble has been in Greece for 30 years and last year
did $106 million in business, Vassilatos said.
   November 17 has claimed the killings of 14 people since 1975. No
member of the group has ever been arrested.
