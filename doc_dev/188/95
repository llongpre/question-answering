   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it will build a $280 million
health-care research center in the Cincinnati area,
underscoring its movement into health-care products.
   The Cincinnati consumer products company said the
facility, to be located 20 miles northeast of Cincinnati in
Warren County, will employ 1,000 people after construction is
completed in 1995.

   The new facility "reflects our belief that health care
will be a major core business for Procter &amp; Gamble in the
coming decades," Chairman Edwin L. Artzt said.
   P&amp;G said the center will house its health-care research
operations currently in Blue Ash, Ohio, and Ross, Ohio, and
parts of its operations now in Norwich, N.Y., and Shelton,
Conn.
