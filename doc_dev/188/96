   Japan's trade minister visited one of the
major machine-tool manufacturing regions of the United States on
Thursday and proposed a dialogue possibly leading up to joint
ventures in the industry.
   Kabun Muto, touring Cincinnati after attending the Houston
economic summit, said the proposal was part of his plan to send a
mission to the United States in September to ease trade tensions
and promote U.S. exports to Japan.
   Muto, head of the powerful Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, spoke to an audience of about 250 at a luncheon sponsored
by the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.
   His appearance was considered symbolically important, since the
Cincinnati area is a bastion of American manufacturing and its
machine-tool industry has been hurt by foreign competition in
recent years.
   The audience included Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Vice President Durk
I. Jager, who heads the company's international operations, and
executives of Japanese businesses operating in Ohio.
   Muto said that his emissaries hope to start a dialogue
``consisting of American machine tool and parts makers, and
Japanese users and makers to exchange opinions on procurements and
establishing such long-term cooperative relationships as joint
ventures.''
   Muto gave no details. But the plan appeared to be part of a much
broader agreement reached last month by Japan and the United States
on ways to open Japan's markets, alleviate the huge U.S. trade
deficit with the Japanese and make American products more
competitive.
   ``Although it is true that the trade imbalance between the
United States and Japan stands at nearly $50 billion, this is not
because Japan is trying to hamper imports from the United States,''
Muto said. ``Japan is certainly not forcibly exporting. It is
merely selling products that are demanded by the U.S. market.''
   Earlier, Muto told a news conference at Procter &amp; Gamble's
headquarters that U.S.-Japanese relations should be based on
cooperation in international economic development.
   His comments reflected the sentiment in a statement issued
Wednesday at the end of the three-day summit of the world's leading
industrialized democracies. They pledged liberalized trade with the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
