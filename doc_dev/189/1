   Cable News Network, the 24-hour all-news cable network, is preparing to launch an evening newscast next month, the first time it has scheduled a news program in competition with the three broadcast networks, according to people at CNN. 

   And in an unorthodox move, the Turner Broadcasting System Inc. unit said it hired Catherine Crier, a state district judge from Dallas with no television or journalistic experience, to be a correspondent and anchor. 
Although CNN didn't specify which program she would be assigned to, the CNN sources said she may co-anchor the new broadcast. 

   CNN, which is expected to undergo some top management changes shortly, declined to comment on the new nightly news program. 
But the CNN sources, who requested anonymity, said the newscast will be one hour long and has the working title "The World Today." 
They said it is scheduled to premiere Oct. 16 at 6 p.m. EDT. Bernard Shaw, an anchor on CNN news programs, will be co-anchor, the sources said. 

   CNN currently airs an entertainment news show, "Show Biz Today," at 6:30 p.m. when the three networks broadcast the first "feed" of their newscasts. 
Each network said that a majority of their affiliates air the broadcasts at 6:30 p.m., instead of 7 p.m., when there is an updated second "feed." 

   In the new tentative lineup, CNN would move its entertainment show to 5:30 p.m. and have a half-hour newscast, "Newswatch." at 5 p.m. CNN declined to comment on plans for "The World Today." 

   A nightly news program that competes with the three broadcast networks is a departure from CNN's original strategy. 
Turner officials said when the cable news channel made its debut in June 1980 that CNN didn't need a traditional evening newscast because it airs news around the clock. 
The network started out in only 1.7 million households; today it is available in more than 51 million cable homes. 
"We're equal in stature now to the networks, and we ought to go where the news viewing public is," said one CNN official. 

   Bill Wheatley, executive producer of "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw," said: "I'm intrigued by a one-hour newscast. 
And as you have more competition, there is always the risk that some of your viewers may leave you. 
But I want to wait to see what they do." 
National Broadcasting Co. is a unit of General Electric Co. 

   NBC is investing in news programming on cable through its new Consumer News and Business Channel, which it owns jointly with Cablevision Systems Corp. 

   CNN's ratings are far lower than the networks'. 
According to figures compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co., CNN has an average rating of 0.8. 
In comparision, "ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings" last week had a 9.1 rating. 
A ratings point represents 904,000 television households. 

   CBS Inc. news officials declined to comment; officials of the ABC news unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. couldn't be reached for comment. 

   CNN's latest moves come at a time when Turner Chairman R.E. "Ted" Turner is considering who will succeed 68-year-old Burt Reinhardt, who has served as president of CNN since 1982. 
Mr. Reinhardt is said to have signed a three-year contract with Turner Broadcasting earlier this year with the understanding that a search for a successor would begin soon. 

   Among the people being considered are Paul Amos, executive vice president for programming; Lou Dobbs, vice president and managing editor of CNN Business News; Jon Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News; and Ed Turner (no relation to Ted Turner), executive vice president for news gathering. 

   Meanwhile, CNN officials defended their decision to hire Ms. Crier. 
"As a judge, trial lawyer and district attorney, Judge Crier has amply demonstrated the kind of critical thinking, knowledge and ability to express herself that are the very core of great journalism," said Mr. Reinhardt in a statement. 
"We've never hired a judge before, and I don't know if any other TV news organization has either, but Judge Crier is a natural and is going to be a great news anchor for CNN." 

   Ms. Crier, 34, was the youngest woman to be elected to the bench in Texas history in 1984, and was re-elected in 1988. 
The Dallas judge resigned her elective post effective Sept. 30. 

   "I've always done a lot of speeches," she said in an interview from her Dallas office, "and the agent who books my appearances recently began talking to me about pursuing this as a career. 
I told him I was very interested and he brought my tape to CNN."
