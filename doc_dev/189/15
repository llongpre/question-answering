   Catherine Crier, a former Texas judge with no
news experience, and Bernard Shaw, who has 25 years in broadcast
news, became TV's newest anchor team Monday with CNN's new ``The
World Today.''
   Crier, who never worked in news until she reported for work two
weeks ago at Cable News Network, made only three slight verbal
flubs and wasn't visibily nervous in her debut on camera and on the
one-hour weeknight series.
   Crier was in CNN headquarters in Atlanta, while Shaw, with CNN
since its creation in 1979, was in Washington.
   Their newscast, which CNN promotions say ``will change the face
of evening news,'' is CNN's first major push against the ``CBS
Evening News,'' ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' and the ``NBC Nightly
News.''
   However, only its second half-hour directly competes with those
broadcasts, and only in the Eastern and Central time zones. It
starts each night at 6 p.m. EDT and is nationally broadcast then,
with no taped repeats for the West Coast.
   West Coast affiliates of the major networks tape the networks'
nightly newscasts for broadcast three or 3{ hours after those
programs appear in the East.
