<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Draws Up Contempt Charges Against CNN in Noriega
Case</HEAD>

   Prosecutors worked on criminal contempt charges
Thursday against CNN for allegedly violating a judge's order
prohibiting the network from airing tapes of Manuel Noriega's
prison telephone calls.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler announced his intention
last week to press contempt charges against the network because it
apparently defied his initial order banning use of the audio tapes.
   Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable News Network to broadcast the
tapes, ruling they did not violate Noriega's right to a fair trial
on charges of providing safe passage for Colombia drug traffickers
through Panama.
   The contempt charges were expected to be ready in a few days,
said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.
   Because the order is against CNN and parent Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. as corporations, any penalties would take the form of
fines - not jail terms, Ms. Cossin said.
   ``CNN is confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue
of contempt, its actions will be vindicated,'' CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said.
