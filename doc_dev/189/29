   Manuel Noriega got his day in court, accusing the
U.S. government of railroading him by freezing his assets and
forcing out his attorneys. A federal judge assured him he will get
a fair trial.
   Meanwhile, at a press conference in Atlanta, Cable News Network
on Friday denied a reporter's box full of tapes and other items on
the Noriega case was made available to the FBI.
   But CNN could not clearly explain a sister company's alleged
role in getting the box to federal agents Thursday.
   Speaking extensively to U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler for
the first time since he surrendered in January to U.S. invasion
troops, Noriega tried Friday to stop him from replacing private
defense attorneys with government-paid lawyers.
   ``I am now at the mercy of a totally unfair and unjust system
that chooses my prosecutors and now chooses my defense lawyers,''
the deposed Panamanian dictator said, reading quietly but
forcefully in Spanish from a prepared statement.
   Led by Frank Rubino, Noriega's lawyers say they can no longer
work unless the Panamanian's assets are unfrozen to pay them, or
the judge raises the $75-an-hour fee cap on court-appointment
lawyers.
   Hoeveler said he would rule in the near future, but reminded the
attorneys that raising the caps for the Noriega case was rejected
previously.
   He also said he received communications from ``some exceedingly
fine criminal defense lawyers'' willing to take the case under the
low government fee schedule.
   ``I want the defendant to understand he is not being cast adrift
by the court and by the judicial system,'' Hoeveler said.
   Earlier Friday, the private defense team filed a broad motion
asking dismissal of all drug charges against their client. It
argued that freezing Noriega's assets and taping his prison phone
calls was government misconduct.
   Hoeveler did not immediately rule on the dismissal motion.
   In the CNN matter, the network claims the FBI contacted Turner
Security, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting Inc., which also
operates CNN. The network says agents told Turner Security they
were searching for a box fitting the description of one hotel
security officers removed earlier in the week from the room of a
reporter assigned to the Noriega case.
   The FBI maintained that agents learned of the box from Turner
Security. Joe Shirley, head of Turner Security, did not return
repeated phone calls Friday.
   William Hinshaw, agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office, said
Shirley called an agent investigating how CNN got the Noriega tapes
and told the agent that a box labeled ``Noriega tapes'' had been
removed from a hotel room. The agent, Hinshaw said, earlier had
contacted Turner Security about interviewing a CNN employee.
   ``I think when (Shirley) called he ... was just trying to
fulfill his responsibility,'' Hinshaw said.
   CNN general counsel Steven Korn insisted the FBI, not Turner
Security, made the first phone call about the box. When asked
whether CNN made the box available to the FBI, Korn replied:
``Emphatically, no.''
   Asked why Turner Security didn't give the box to CNN, Korn said,
``That's a good question.''
   CNN has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Hoeveler's
order, issued last week, barring it from broadcasting recordings of
prison telephone conversations between Noriega and his defense
team.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said Friday he didn't know if the
recordings contained in the box were audio or video tapes, or if
they contained phone calls between Noriega and his legal team.
   Noriega is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami on charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombia's Medellin cocaine
cartel.
