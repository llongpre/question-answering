A federal judge Wednesday lifted the ban against the broadcast of tape 
recordings of Manuel A. Noriega's jailhouse phone conversations, effectively 
ending a three-week legal battle over the rights of the press versus the right 
to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing seven tapes turned over by Cable News Network, U.S. District 
Judge William M. Hoeveler determined that the only attorney-client conversation 
on the tapes already had been broadcast by CNN, which had aired some of the 
tapes before the judge ordered the network to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them," Hoeveler said 
during a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rubino, Noriega's chief defense counsel, said he had no objection to the 
lifting of the ban. "The damage is done," he said. "A ban now is like shutting 
the barn door after the horse escapes." 
</P>
<P>
Rubino said he would pursue his motion to dismiss the case on the grounds of 
government misconduct, along with a separate motion asking that the network be 
found in contempt of court for airing more of Noriega's conversations after the 
judge's Nov. 8 ban, and that CNN be fined $300,000 per broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
CNN first broadcast two weeks ago portions of several tape recordings that were 
made by officials of the federal prison south of here where Noriega has been 
held on drug charges since he was seized during the U.S. invasion of Panama 11 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
One of those conversations was between Noriega and a Spanish-speaking secretary 
for Rubino who served as a translator. 
</P>
<P>
After the first broadcast, Rubino asked Hoeveler to issue a ban, and he did. 
CNN appealed that temporary order, and on Nov. 18 the Supreme Court refused to 
lift it. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Korn, an attorney for CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting Systems 
Inc., reiterated the network position that prior restraint is never 
appropriate. "It's fizzled," he said of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Smolla, a William and Mary law professor who heads the school's 
Institute of Bill of Rights Law, told the Associated Press that it would have 
been better had the issue returned to the high court for a final resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Supreme Court let the ban stand "casts its shadow, and the 
shadow is negative," he said. "Other lawyers will aggressively pursue these 
sorts of strategies against news organizations. The battle isn't over yet." 
</P>
<P>
CNN founder Ted Turner, who was attending the Western Cable Television 
conference Wednesday in Anaheim, described the ruling as "a positive 
development . . . . It doesn't really resolve the 1st Amendment issue 
completely . . . (but) it's good for us." 
</P>
<P>
CNN President Tom Johnson said the network can now pursue its story on the 
government's taping of the ousted Panamanian leader's conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this judicial prior 
restraint on press freedom," he said. "Despite the unfortunate delay, CNN's 
reporting of government taping of Noriega phone conversations will continue." 
</P>
<P>
The government has acknowledged routine taping of prisoners' phone calls at 
federal prisons. Noriega signed a release acknowledging that his calls were 
being monitored, but the defense said that release does not apply to 
conversations with his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler on Wednesday ordered the Bureau of Prisons to cease sharing Noriega's 
tapes with other government agencies unless he approves. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Noriega, who is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 28, is plagued 
now by only one "collateral issue," in Hoeveler's words, and that is money. 
Rubino says he has been unpaid for the last 11 months because about $27 million 
stashed by Noriega in overseas bank accounts has been frozen at the request of 
the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hoeveler ordered the government to try again to make some of that 
money available.
