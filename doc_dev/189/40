   The ratings still begin with a decimal point, but
Cable News Network is standing by its fledgling dinner-time
newscast, ``The World Today.''
   CNN launched the one-hour program in October, starting it at 6
p.m. EST, a time slot in which its second half-hour competes
directly with the nightly newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC in the
Eastern and Central time zones, where 75 percent of the nation's
viewers live.
   CNN's new show gained some immediate attention with the
selection of Catherine Crier, up until last year a Texas judge, to
join veteran newsman Bernard Shaw at the anchor desk _ Crier in
Atlanta, Shaw in Washington.
   The ratings show they aren't yet in the same league with ABC's
Peter Jennings, NBC's Tom Brokaw and CBS' Dan Rather. Far from it.
   Last week's Nielsens showed ABC's ``World News Tonight'' winning
its eighth consecutive victory with an 11.3 ratings average,
followed by the ``NBC Nightly News'' with a 10.1 average and the
``CBS Evening News'' with a 9.9.
   CNN says its ratings are averaging a .7, but the gap is even
bigger than it looks. In broadcasting, one rating point equals
921,000 homes. In cable, one point for CNN equals 547,820 homes,
the number CNN estimates it serves.
   But CNN says ratings for ``The World Today'' are growing every
month, and already are 16 percent better than the two programs
previously in the same time period.
   ``We're going to move ahead and stick to our game plan,'' said
Paul Amos, CNN's executive vice president of news programming.
``We're not going to abandon this in the short term. This is a very
long-term-oriented project.''
   Amos said the program has proved ``to be the right move ...
because we've managed to take a time period that was relatively
stagnant and improve on it.''
   Among other things, the program will be served _ although not
exclusively _by the new CNN investigative unit headed by Pamela
Hill, who for years was in charge of ABC News' now-defunct
``Closeup'' documentary unit.
   Hill's team, whose reports will start airing this month on CNN
broadcasts, includes former NBC political correspondent Ken Bode,
who signed on Friday as a contributing correspondent.
   Bode, who left NBC News last year to teach, will continue his
other job as a college professor, a CNN spokeswoman said.
   Bode is a print and broadcast news veteran. But not Crier. CNN
took perhaps one of its biggest chances when it hired her for ``The
World Today.''
   Her journalistic debut coincided with the program's, but Crier,
35, a civil judge for five years, said the parallels are
``tremendous'' between her old profession and her new one.
   As a trial lawyer, she said, she gathered facts by interviewing
witnesses and then delivered those facts clearly to a judge or
jury. As a judge, she said, she had to glean facts from piles of
evidence and draw objective conclusions.
   But while a judge might take weeks to weigh a case's evidence
before ruling, Crier said, TV reporting requires an enormous amount
of spontaneity because of its immediacy.
   Amos acknowledged that some at CNN were concerned about Crier's
inexperience.
   ``She was an unknown commodity,'' he said. ``And once she
started working at a computer terminal, Catherine Crier became
another staffer, and the rest of our journalists came to know her
and have warmed up to her.''
   CNN plans to publicize ``The World Today'' this spring with a
major advertising campaign.
   Many viewers have watched their evening news on the same network
for a generation, Amos said, adding, ``a 25-year-old ingrained
habit _ ... that's a tough habit to break.''
   ``It's going to take a long time to make the public aware that
we are here,'' he said. ``Less than 60 percent of the nation's
households have cable or access to the program.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   RATHER EXAMINES BURNOUT: Thursday's ``48 Hours,'' anchored by
Dan Rather, will examine the human cost of too fast a pace in life
and business in America. Among other things, the CBS show will
report on a California entrepreneur who CBS says ``has turned his
car into the office of the future _ and his life into a
round-the-clock rush hour.''
