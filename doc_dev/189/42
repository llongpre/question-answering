<HEAD>CNN To Appeal Noriega Tapes Order to Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNN will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a
ban on broadcasting tapes of Manuel Noriega's telephone
conversations with his legal team.
   Constitutional law experts said it could become a landmark case.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said Nov. 11 that the appeal was
being prepared, but he didn't know when it would be filed.
   CNN had defied an order Nov. 9 by U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler of Miami by broadcasting an excerpt in which the deposed
Panamanian dictator spoke in Spanish with a secretary for defense
lawyer Frank Rubino.
   CNN decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the
excerpt early Nov. 10, Haworth said. Later that day, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld Hoeveler's ruling.
   The appeals court also told CNN to give the seven tapes to the
Miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would
endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the invasion of Panama in December.
   Rubino asked Hoeveler to find CNN in direct civil contempt and
fine the network $300,000 for each time it televised the tapes and
each time it showed them in the future.
   CNN accused Hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself
from the case.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York constitutional lawyer who served as
co-counsel for The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, said
the CNN case could set precedent because rules involving prior
restraint have been very clear through the years.
   ``We've almost totally banned prior restraint,'' Abrams said.
``If the Supreme Court were to uphold the prior-restraint order on
CNN, this would be the first time in our country's history that any
such court order had been affirmed by the court.''
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the U.S. Supreme Court said
the government could not bar publication of classified documents
about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Times appealed rather than
defy a lower court order.
   George Rahdert, a lawyer at the Poynter Institute of Media
Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., called the CNN case ``an
astonishing illustration of censorship,'' but said the network was
``playing with blasting caps'' by defying the judge's order.
   ``It's rare in general that a news organization of any kind -
broadcast, cable or print - would do such a thing,'' said Rahdert,
who represents several newspapers. ``It really falls into the
category of civil disobedience.''
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the case is a classic
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover.
   He said the district court and appeals court construed the case
as a conflict between the Sixth Amendment, which provides a
defendant a right to a fair trial, and the First Amendment, which
provides for freedom of the press.
   ``There's a more fundamental issue here: reporting the news of
possible governmental misconduct,'' Johnson said. ``If CNN can be
restrained from airing news about the Noriega tapes, so can any
news organization.''
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said U.S. officials wanted
to find out how the tapes were leaked to CNN.
   ``It concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was
made of these tapes,'' he said.
   Hoeveler said he had to weigh Noriega's right to a fair trial
against CNN's right to freedom of the press.
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' he said.
   CNN's broadcast marked the first time the tapes themselves had
been made public, but not the first time their contents were
reported.
   New York Newsday published a story last month based on summaries
of the tapes in which unidentified federal sources said it appeared
the former Panamanian leader was attempting to organize resistance
to the U.S.-supported government of President Guillermo Endara,
which replaced his regime.

<HEAD>Newspapers Ask Appeals Court To Publish Restraint Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rock Hill Herald and The Charlotte
(N.C.) Observer want an appeals court to publish its opinion
overruling a federal judge's prior-restraint order so it can serve
as a legal precedent.
   ``The opinion in this case, if published, will provide
substantial guidance to lower courts in this circuit, in the event
they are requested, or otherwise inclined, to prohibit the news
media from publishing information properly obtained during open
court proceedings,'' papers filed by the newspapers' lawyers said.
   If the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals does publish its
opinion, it would mean the case could be cited as a precedent in
future prior-restraint cases, said David Robinson II, a lawyer for
The Herald.
   ``There's nothing published of recent vintage that deals with
open court statements and prior restraint,'' Robinson said Nov. 9.
``We think this would be helpful in the future.''
   Unpublished opinions made by the appeals court cannot be cited
in legal proceedings, Robinson said.
   The case began Oct. 31 when U.S. District Judge Charles E.
Simons Jr. inadvertently said in open court in Columbia, S.C., that
Rock Hill attorney Mitchell K. Byrd was a ``target'' of a drug
investigation.
   When Simons was told that reporters from The Herald and the
Observer were in the courtroom, he ordered them not to print his
remark.
   Both newspapers appealed the order and neither printed the name
the following morning.
   The Herald printed the judge's statement about Byrd on Nov. 2
and was later called to court to defend that action.
   On Nov. 6, the appeals court declared the judge's original order
invalid, and Simons dropped his case against The Herald and
canceled the ordered court appearance.
   John Buchan, a lawyer for the Observer, said federal trial
judges are bound by precedents in their circuits and therefore
would be required to follow this order, if published.
   ``Having such a precedent will resolve such issues before they
reach the appellate court, because the laws will be very clear,''
Buchan said.
