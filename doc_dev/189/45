   CNN's tapes of Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone
calls to his legal team are in the hands of a federal magistrate
who will help determine whether the former dictator's right to a
fair trial has been jeopardized.
   The network handed over a briefcase full of tapes on Tuesday
after the U.S. Supreme Court refused over the weekend to lift U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler's temporary order barring CNN from
airing the recordings.
   U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff will make and study transcripts
and report to Hoeveler, who as the judge who will preside over
Noriega's trial on drug trafficking charges will weigh a defense
request to dismiss the case.
   Hoeveler assigned Turnoff to listen to the tapes to avoid being
``tainted'' by having learned details of Noriega's defense
strategy.
   No time limit for reviewing the tapes was set, but Noriega's
lead attorney, Frank Rubino, said the judge guaranteed it would
done ``with dispatch.''
   Rubino also asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against CNN
for airing a conversation in alleged violation of the judge's
order. The judge did not immediately set a hearing, saying he must
await a decision by the chief judge of his judicial district on a
CNN request to remove him from the tapes case.
   CNN attorney Steven Korn wouldn't say how many tapes were turned
over. He would not discuss their contents or origins but said he
was confident that the judge will rescind his so-called prior
restraint on broadcast of the tapes.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with matters protected by
attorney-client confidentiality - in part because Rubino tacitly
agreed to broadcasting them when he identified them on the air.
   Noriega has asked that the case against him be dismissed because
of the taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged
government misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed outside of Miami on charges of
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't
expected to begin before the spring.
