   A judge today barred the Cable News Network from
televising recordings of telephone conversations between jailed
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and his attorneys. CNN called
the order unconstitutional and said network ``will continue our
coverage.''
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler said as details of the tapes came out in court.
   Following an emergency hearing this morning, the judge ordered
the network not to televise any tape that could infringe on
Noriega's attorney-client privilege.
   The emergency hearing, revolving around attorney-client issues
and First Amendment rights, was called after CNN used excerpts from
the jailhouse tapes this morning and said it planned to televise
another installment this evening.
   After issuing a temporary injunction, Hoeveler said he would
continue to study the issue and expected to have a final decision
by around 6 p.m., when the network was scheduled to have the second
installment.
   CNN President Tom Johnson issued a statement saying that an
appeal of the temporary injunction was being readied and adding:
``Because of our belief the order is unconstitutional, we will
continue our coverage as we challenge this restraining order in the
courts.''
   CNN attorney Daniel Waggoner said an ``any order, even one of a
few hours as the court has imposed here, that prevents any
publication or telecast, is an unconstitutional prior restraint.''
   Steve Haworth, CNN spokesman, said the network was continuing to
televise a segment that was first used this morning, which includes
segments of Noriega audio tapes that do not involve his attorneys.
Haworth declined to comment on whether any tapes involving
attorneys would be used later.
   Federal prison officials said inmates' phone conversations are
routinely monitored, except when they are talking to their lawyers.
But CNN said in its report this morning that it ``has a tape which
appears to be excepts of a conversation between Noriega and his
defense team. CNN has also been shown evidence that there are other
such recordings.''
   Conversations between a lawyer and client are deemed to be legal
secrets, except in extraordinary circumstances.
   Noriega has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
southwest of Miami since shortly after he surrendered to U.S.
troops in Panama following the invasion last December.
   He is awaiting trial on a February 1988 drug trafficking
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel to protect their smuggling
operations through his country.
   Noriega attorney Frank Rubino told the judge that a CNN team
informed him Wednesday night they had obtained seven recordings
made by the Justice Department at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center.
   CNN televised excerpts today, offering a translation of a
Spanish conversation between Noriega and an unidentified man about
consolidating Noriega's power base in Panama, and a message to the
Cuban embassy in Panama.
   But CNN also played another tape for Rubino, who identified it
as Noriega's conversation with three defense team members.
   ``Can General Noriega receive a fair trial when every day we
wake up to the threat of our case strategy being aired to 400
million listeners, and the prosecution learning details of our
defense?'' Rubino asked.
   ``Without a doubt this is the most serious violation (of
attorney-client privilege) I have ever experienced in my years of
practice,'' Rubino told Hoeveler.
   The judge asked Waggoner whether he thought the network had the
right to ``shoot his (Noriega's) defense right in the head'' by
cablecasting the tapes.
   Gregory Bogdan, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in
Washington, said all telephone calls leaving federal prisons are
monitored.
   All prisoners sign a release form in both English and Spanish
notifying them of the procedure, and signs are posted over prison
phones reminding inmates that the calls are monitored, he said.
   ``But if they let us know they are calling their attorney, then
we don't monitor them,'' Bogdan said.
   Tapes are kept to prevent crimes from being planned behind bars
and are not normally released, he said.
   He said he did not know if CNN's tapes were official government
tapes, adding: ``Right now, the matter is under investigation -
where the tapes came from, where they were made.''
   Hoeveler said he would order the FBI to determine the source of
the tapes.
   Prosecutors told the judge they had not heard the tapes and
would be ``blindfolded'' during the investigation of how they were
released.
