<HEAD>Tribune To End `USA Tonight' Under Deal With Turner Broadcasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Tribune Broadcasting Co. will discontinue its
nightly ``USA Tonight'' newscasts and use Cable News Network in six
markets under an agreement announced Monday with Turner
Broadcasting System Inc.
   The 10-year deal, announced by TBS Chairman Ted Turner and
Tribune President James C. Dowdle, also includes joint production
of news, documentary specials and entertainment programs.
   As part of the agreement, Tribune will end ``USA Tonight'' and
its IDNX news service. Six Tribune stations will become affiliates
of Cable News Network, subscribing to CNN coverage on a
non-exclusive basis.
   Those stations are WPIX in New York, KTLA in Los Angeles, WGN in
Chicago, WGNX in Atlanta, KWGN in Denver and WGNO in New Orleans.
   The stations will use the CNN coverage to expand their evening
newscasts to one hour this summer, Tribune officials said in a
statement. ``USA Tonight'' and IDNX will be discontinued in June,
Dowdle said.
   ``We're delighted to bring Turner Broadcasting's worldwide
news-gathering capabilities to the Tribune newscasts and are very
optimistic about the future entertainment program undertakings,''
Dowdle said.
   ``We have worked with Tribune Broadcasting Company over the
years with very positive results,'' Turner said. ``We are convinced
that the extension of this relationship will result in a
significant programming venture.''
   The two companies also will work together to produce quarterly
news specials and original entertainment programming. Tentative
plans include production of two mini-series per year for broadcast
on Tribune stations, Atlanta television station TBS and in general
syndication.
   The entertainment programs will be distributed worldwide by
Turner Program Services while Tribune Entertainment Company will
handle advertising sales.
