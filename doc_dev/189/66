   Tribune Broadcasting Co. has agreed to
discontinue its ``USA Tonight'' national newscast and use Cable
News Network in six markets to expand local newscasts under an
agreement with Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   The 10-year agreement, announced Monday by TBS Chairman Ted
Turner and Tribune President James C. Dowdle, also includes joint
production of news, documentary specials and entertainment programs.
   ``We're delighted to bring Turner Broadcasting's worldwide
news-gathering capabilities to the Tribune newscasts and are very
optimistic about the future entertainment program undertakings,''
Dowdle said.
   As part of the agreement, Tribune will discontinue its nightly
newscast, ``USA Tonight,'' and its IDNX news service. Six Tribune
stations will become affiliates of Cable News Network, subscribing
to CNN coverage on a non-exclusive basis.
   Those stations are WPIX in New York, KTLA in Los Angeles, WGN in
Chicago, WGNX in Atlanta, KWGN in Denver and WGNO in New Orleans.
   The stations will use the CNN coverage to expand their evening
newscasts to one hour this summer, Tribune officials said in a
statement. ``USA Tonight'' and IDNX will be discontinued in June,
Dowdle said.
   ``We have worked with Tribune Broadcasting Co. over the years
with very positive results,'' Turner said. ``We are convinced that
the extension of this relationship will result in a significant
programming venture.''
   The two companies will also work together to produce quarterly
news specials and original entertainment programming. Tentative
plans include production of two mini-series per year for broadcast
on Tribune stations, Atlanta television station TBS and in general
syndication.
   The entertainment programs will be distributed worldwide by
Turner Program Services while Tribune Entertainment Co. will handle
advertising sales.
