</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a busy day in the global village. George Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev and 
South African President F.W. de Klerk are all making front-page news. West 
Virginia is under a court order to close an overcrowded prison, the Toronto 
city council is considering a measure to curb the greenhouse effect and Japan 
is introducing a new bullet train. 
</P>
<P>
Around a large conference table in the Atlanta headquarters of Cable News 
Network, the senior executives and producers of CNN gather at 8 a.m. to 
determine the run-down of stories and the deployment of troops -- which stories 
should be covered live, which ones will be reported and shot by CNN's own 
correspondents and crews, and which will include video footage from 
international news services. 
</P>
<P>
Since CNN, as advertised, is a 24-hour news channel with newscasts throughout 
the day, the pressure is to get the stories on the air as soon as possible, 
with updates for several newscasts through the day. "The broadcast networks 
focus their resources on their half-hour evening newscasts," Ed Turner, the CNN 
executive in charge of news-gathering, will say later in an interview. "Our 
charter is to get it in and get it on. Get it right, but get it on." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at the same time, there's another pull at CNN these days. Although 
producer Bob Furnad wants to know why a Washington reporter can't "turn a quick 
spot preview" of an upcoming speech by noon, he says of a feature on an 
endangered species, "Can we run it at 2? Don't ruin it." 
</P>
<P>
"That's promotable," Turner says of a piece about an inventor who is 
successfully suing big auto companies. 
</P>
<P>
The word promotable -- meaning an upcoming story that can be teased to keep 
zap-happy viewers tuned in -- may never replace the word now at CNN. But as 
Cable News Network approaches its 10th anniversary in June, it is facing 
something of an identity crisis. Even as it grows, CNN is grappling with its 
vision of the future. 
</P>
<P>
CNN has made its reputation with its round-the-clock, no-frills format and 
extended live coverage, from the revolution in China to the stock-market crash 
on Wall Street. In pointed contrast to the broadcast networks, CNN has prided 
itself on making the news -- not the anchor -- the star. But despite recent 
gains, CNN's Nielsen ratings have hit a plateau, averaging a 0.7 in the 
Nielsens over the course of a day in February (meaning that about 645,000 
households are tuned in at any given time). Although the company is not under 
broadcast-style ratings pressure, having generated operating profits of $134 
million in 1989, CNN executives are thinking about ways to bring in more 
regular viewers -- and to provide the kind of in-depth analysis that its 
critics say it needs to grow beyond being a video wire service. 
</P>
<P>
Does that translate into the high-profile investigative team that made its 
on-air debut last week? Will there be more "network"-style anchors like 
Catherine Crier, a former Texas judge who was hired last fall to co-anchor a 
CNN newscast without any experience in journalism? Says one CNN producer, 
"We're at a crossroads." 
</P>
<P>
Once derided as the "Chicken Noodle Network" by broadcast-TV executives, CNN 
has upped the ante in broadcast news, forcing ABC, CBS and NBC to increase 
their live news coverage and regularly fly their anchors around the world to 
the scenes of big stories. So entrenched is the upstart that CBS executives 
recently went to Atlanta to court CNN founder Ted Turner, their old nemesis, 
about possibly sharing some news-gathering facilities. Now seen in 90 countries 
around the world, CNN has become such a force in video-geopolitics that 
President Bush is reported to have watched CNN to see how the invasion of 
Panama was going, and a recent CNN report that Gorbachev was considering 
resigning his position as chief of the Communist party immediately affected 
financial markets around the world. CNN won the prestigious Du Pont Award for 
its live coverage of the turmoil in China last year, which was anchored by 
Bernard Shaw and included dramatic on-camera negotiations with Chinese 
authorities trying to pull the plug on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN has become an international habit . . . for catching fast-breaking news," 
says Ben Bagdikian, a professor at the graduate journalism school of UC 
Berkeley. Comparing CNN to a video wire service, Bagdikian says, "They operate 
around the clock and around the world, offering straight accounts of events 
without necessarily having it in depth, the way the networks try to achieve. 
The broadcast networks have countered by offering the big story in depth. But 
with their own cutbacks, the network are caught between the devil and the deep 
blue sea." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we've established ourselves as the network where people know they 
can tune in when something happens, knowing we'll be there to stay with the 
story," Ed Turner says. "News is our only story, and we don't have to break 
into 'Major Dad' to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a major news event has an immediate impact on CNN's ratings. The Bay 
Area earthquake last October gave CNN its highest average audience: The day 
after the temblor, an average of 1,273,000 households watched CNN throughout 
the day. The ratings were only slightly smaller the day after the U.S. invasion 
of Panama last January. The highest ratings for one 15-minute period were 
registered during the rescue of Jessica McClure from a Texas well in October, 
1987, when 3.1 million households were tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
Events in China and Berlin produced slightly higher numbers than normal but not 
nearly the same as Panama and the earthquake. "We had great stuff from China, 
and sometimes the very crudeness of it made it great," says Furnad, vice 
president and senior producer at CNN. "But the ratings jumped and then fell 
off. It's sad, but maybe that's because American lives were not at stake." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Furnad said, issues such as abortion and animal-rights are 
emotional "spikes" that excite viewer interest. Furnad is encouraging CNN 
producers to identify such stories each day and use them to pace the newscast 
with emotion, not sound and pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a philosophy of pacing stories that has been around a long time," 
maintains Furnad, a former producer for ABC's "World News Tonight." "The budget 
is an emotional story, too, if you tell it correctly, and so was (that day's) 
story about a Supreme Court ruling on 'nuisance suits' by lawyers. The lead 
story is still the lead story, but if it's dull as sin, the second story should 
have emotional appeal. We live in an environment where people are watching a 
channel for three minutes and then pressing that clicker. We've got to get them 
watching and keep them watching in that environment." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for CNN now is to maintain its franchise (and influential 
audience) as the all-news network while enhancing its programming to attract 
new viewers and persuade its core audience to watch more. 
</P>
<P>
"The spine of the network will be breaking news, live," Ed Turner says. "We're 
the network that brought you months of the Oliver North trial -- and not just 
the Fawn Hall testimony -- and, if people don't want to watch it, tough, that's 
what we ought to be doing. But to grow in the 1990s, we need to both expand our 
international bureaus and do more in-depth reporting." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the prestige that its new investigative team may bring CNN, Turner 
maintains that it will also bring in viewers. "We'd like to win awards with it, 
of course," he says, "but I'm hoping that it will give us material that will 
bring in serious news viewers, making our newscasts better and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
CNN began airing the first reports from its "Special Assignment" investigative 
unit last Monday -- a four-part investigation into practices in college 
basketball. Originated by Ted Turner, the unit is headed by Pam Hill, who 
previously spent 10 years in charge of the award-winning documentary department 
at ABC News. Hill has recruited an impressive list of producers and reporters 
from both TV and print, from former NBC News political reporter Ken Bode to 
Brooks Jackson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter from The Wall Street Journal, 
along with documentary producers from "60 Minutes" and "CBS Reports." 
</P>
<P>
With an annual budget of several million dollars, "Special Assignment" is a 
departure for CNN, which began on the cheap, with non-union talent, many of 
them young people just out of college, and continues to be a place where bureau 
chiefs literally have to account for the number of notebooks they use. But if 
there is occasional grumbling about the unit's resources, it also is seen as a 
sign of the growth of CNN. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started out here 10 years ago, newsmakers didn't know who we were, and, 
on a public-affairs show here, I used to book the special assistant to the 
acting secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the President's commission on 
the metric system," jokes Wendy Walker, the 37-year-old Washington producer for 
CNN. "When we were in Poland recently, I saw Lech Walesa practicing his speech 
wearing a CNN T-shirt. The creation of the investigative unit is another good 
sign because it shows a real commitment to long-term, serious journalism." 
</P>
<P>
The hiring of Catherine Crier, however, seems to many at CNN to be a 
contradictory sign. Despite her lack of experience in journalism, Crier was 
hired to co-anchor the newscast that CNN introduced last October, "The World 
Today." The move has been criticized by TV reviewers and some CNN hands. "If 
you think she's got potential for television," one staffer argues, "why not 
send her out to do reporting? Otherwise, we're no different from the networks 
when they hire some attractive woman with little experience." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Amos, the CNN executive in charge of developing programming, defends the 
choice of Crier, saying, "She has skills in terms of questioning and 
interviewing as a prosecutor and judge. We hired her because we think she has 
the capability of being a good communicator, not simply someone reading copy." 
</P>
<P>
Amos believes that where CNN will make its mark in the next decade is in 
"coming up with breakthrough news programs that are more than news coverage." 
He once considered a news quiz show but abandoned that idea. "Whatever we do 
will be consistent with our news coverage," Amos promises. "We're not talking 
about a musical-variety news show." 
</P>
<P>
So what will it be, a Nairobi bureau or a new satellite uplink from Eastern 
Europe, a high-priced "star" anchor or a team of researchers to pore over 
documents looking for fraud? Cable News Network doesn't yet have to select 
among the competing visions of its future. But when it does, the choices it 
makes -- among hard news, analysis and the entertainment values of network TV 
-- will be televised live around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to examine every possibility to stay competitive in an environment 
where we're up against 50 different cable channels," Amos says. "If you sit 
there and do business as usual, thinking you've captured your market niche, 
you'll get buried."
