   Cable News Network, which never has been short on
ambition, is getting the global audience it wants by finding room
at the inns.
   While the Atlanta-based news channel now is seen in 84
countries, the best chance of catching CNN overseas is in a hotel
room. It still is rarity to see CNN in an average person's home
outside the United States.
   Transmitting CNN around the world was one of Ted Turner's goals
when his Turner Broadcasting System Inc. launched the 24-hour cable
network in 1980. The network has gradually increased its audience
potential and made its latest stride over the summer when it
arranged to use a Soviet satellite for transmissions in that corner
of the world.
   CNN is available in about 600 hotels _ more than 1 million rooms
_ worldwide. Other major international clients for CNN include
embassies, government offices, foreign news services and, to a
lesser extent, local cable television systems. CNN programming also
is shown on eight airlines, which excerpt segments to show
passengers on intercontinental flights.
   Network officials add that CNN is widely pirated and overall is
available to about 200 million people around the world.
   ``All of the populated areas of the world have the capability of
getting CNN,'' said Bob Ross, managing director of CNN
International Sales Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of TBS based in
London.
   ``With the exception of Antarctica and the western tip of
Australia ... the whole world gets it,'' Ross said.
   Though CNN is available domestically in 51.1 million U.S.
households, the target audience overseas is not the average TV
viewer, Ross said in a recent interview.
   Instead, CNN wants to be seen overseas by the wealthy and the
powerful _ heads of government, business leaders, Americans who are
traveling and other assorted VIPs, he said.
   ``What we're doing is making CNN the first global real-time news
medium, which will make CNN the network of record for major
decision-makers all over the world,'' Ross said. ``We will become a
primary news source for the world's decision-makers.''
   There are numerous obstacles to getting CNN to the world's
masses, Ross said. Most international transmissions are in English,
the necessary satellite reception equipment is too expensive for
many people, and in many places the government doesn't want its
people to have easy access to Western news reporting.
   ``We're not a mass entertainment network,'' Ross said. ``We
don't expect to be watched by a welder who is only fluent in his
native language.''
   It's easy to imagine, though, that Turner, a globe-trotting
champion of peace among nations, would want ultimately to make his
programming available to the widest audience possible.
   ``I think that's Ted's goal, to get CNN to everyone,'' said Russ
Barry, the Los Angeles-based president of Turner Program Services,
TBS' syndication arm.
   Barry said TBS is getting inquiries from areas that receive CNN
which also are interested in receiving other Turner programming,
such as the shows on the TBS ``SuperStation'' and Turner Network
Television's all-day schedule of vintage movies.
   ``The international market is quite active,'' he said.
   CNN's first international markets were in Canada and Australia
in 1983. The network broke into Europe in 1985, Japan the following
year, South America in 1988 and Asia and Africa this year, Ross
said.
   The version of CNN seen overseas has some modifications from the
U.S. presentation _ for example, in many places it is not available
24 hours a day _ but Ross said it is fundamentally the same.
   ``It is an American news product and it does reflect an American
perception of events _ as objectively as we can, but some intrinsic
perception is American,'' he said.
   Ralph Wenge, who anchors CNN's daily ``International Hour'' and
weekend ``World Report'' from Atlanta, said the network's global
view reflects a growing public awareness of how events thousands of
miles apart are interrelated.
   He said the international elements of CNN's programming also
have contributed to the network's increased respect here and abroad.
   The network's increased presence cuts both ways, however, Wenge
said. While most of the response to CNN's international work is
positive, some people overseas resent the strong presence of a U.S.
news operation.
   ``The other side is, `Why should a broadcast network originating
in the United States come into our countries and tell us what's
happening in our country?''' Wenge said. ``They'd like their own
CNN.''
