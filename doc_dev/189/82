   NEW YORK -- CBS Inc., pressured by losses at its network
and in the midst of staff reductions, has approached Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. to revive talks about joint news
gathering to further trim costs.
   Top officials of CBS and Turner will meet in the next few
weeks to discuss a partnership between CBS News and Turner's
Cable News Network. The two organizations may agree to share
news footage and facilities in foreign and domestic bureaus,
and CBS News may end up having CNN cover lesser news events,
such as a political rally or a routine presidential
announcement, people familiar with the plans said.

   Spokeswomen for CBS and Turner confirmed the discussions,
which were first reported yesterday in Electronic Media, a
trade publication. Ed Turner, executive vice president of
CNN, said the revived talks were initiated by CBS Chairman
Laurence A. Tisch. "We'll listen and hear what CBS has to
offer," Mr. Turner said. "CNN isn't going in there with a
wish list."
   A shared news gathering arrangement would be the most
drastic step yet by a network news division to pare the high
costs of coverage. The news operations of all three major
broadcast networks are examining ways of reducing costs. They
each spent upward of $40 million to cover the war, at a time
when many viewers were tuned to CNN and advertisers were
withdrawing commercials rather than let them run during
special war coverage.
   The cost pressures have been toughest, however, at CBS.
The broadcasting company, hurt by an industrywide advertising
slump and by large losses on its sports programming, is
laying off 6% of its work force, or about 400 employees, in
1991. CBS News is taking the largest cut, laying off about
100 of its 1,065 employees and reducing staff in various news
bureaus, including the one in Atlanta, where CNN is based.
   But CBS and Turner Broadcasting haven't made progress in
previous efforts to link up; discussions in February 1990
ended after the two sides couldn't come to terms. And the
prospect of joining forces with Turner concerns some insiders
at CBS News, who fear that the organization would become
merely a packager of the news.
   A partnership with CNN, however, would enable CBS News to
devote its limited resources to the production of profitable
prime-time programs, including "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours."
   Once fierce competitors, the three networks and CNN
already cooperate to a limited degree on some stories. In
April 1990, for example, CBS News, CNN and ABC News, a unit
of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., combined equipment and crews to
cover the release of a U.S. hostage in the Middle East, each
saving about $12,000 by pooling the coverage.
