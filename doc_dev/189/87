<HEAD>Affectionate Turner, Fonda Steal Show at CNN Birthday Bash</HEAD>

   Ted Turner and Jane Fonda stole the show at the
anniversary party for Cable News Network, the Turner brainchild
that turns 10 on June 1.
   The Turner Broadcasting chairman and the actress-aerobics
empress drew crowds wherever they turned during the celebration
Sunday night at CNN Center, headquarters for Turner's media empire.
   But the attention didn't keep them from being openly
affectionate. While a highlight tape of CNN's first 10 years was
shown on a giant monitor, Ms. Fonda wrapped her arms around
Turner's waist and rested her chin on his shoulder and he caressed
her hand.
   ``I have to kind of pinch myself to realize it's gone by so
quickly,'' Turner said in brief remarks about CNN's first decade.
``The next 10 won't be quite as exciting as the first 10, but stay
tuned.''
   The party, which drew about 3,000 guests, was timed to coincide
with the opening of the National Cable Television Association's
annual convention, next door at the Georgia World Congress Center.
   Among other celebrities attending were Maureen Reagan, talk show
host Larry King, CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw and U.S. Rep. Edward
Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House
telecommunications subcommittee.
