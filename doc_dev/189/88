   Times Mirror Co. Vice Chairman Tom Johnson, who
has spent most of his career in print journalism, was named today
as as president and chief executive of Ted Turner's Cable News
Network.
   Johnson, 48, who began at the Macon Telegraph and News in his
native Georgia, will succeed Burt Reinhardt, 70, on Aug. 1.
Reinhardt has been with the all-news cable network since Turner
began it 10 years ago and became its president in 1982.
   Turner, chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System,
announced Johnson's hiring in Seattle, where he is attending the
Goodwill Games sports competition his company is sponsoring.
   Reinhardt will become vice chairman of CNN and advise Johnson
during the latter's transition into his new job. Reinhardt plans to
retire later, a CNN spokeswoman in New York said.
   The Atlanta-based CNN, the 24-hour all-news network, reached
53.8 million U.S. households last year. It says it reaches 90 other
nations.
   Johnson would leave his job as chairman of Times Mirror's
newspaper management committee. Last year, he stepped down as
publisher of the Los Angeles Times after nine years in that post.
   Turner, who conducted a yearlong search for Reinhardt's
replacement, spoke with Johnson about three weeks ago and the job
was offered to him Thursday, the Los Angeles Times said.
   Johnson leaves Times Mirror after 17 years, 13 of them at the
Los Angeles Times. During his tenure as publisher, the newspaper's
revenue tripled from $333 million to more than $1 billion.
