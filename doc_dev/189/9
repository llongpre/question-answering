   Attorneys for Manuel Noriega and Cable News Network
agreed today to cool off their constitutional showdown, at least
until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the issue of tape-recorded
conversations.
   Under the agreement, Noriega will not ask for contempt penalties
as long as CNN continues to refrain from broadcasting tapes between
the deposed Panamanian leader and his lawyers.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler endorsed the deal, but once
again warned CNN, noting that over the weekend the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta had backed his original gag
order.
   ``If you play any tapes in violation of my order, you are
violating not only my order, but also the appeals court order,''
Hoeveler said.
   CNN's attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the
deal, but had the right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they
did not include conversations with his lawyers. The judge agreed.
   In Atlanta, where the network is based, CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said that the network expects to file its appeal to the
Supreme Court later in the week.
   Constitutional law experts said the confrontation could become a
landmark case.
   CNN had defied an order Friday by Hoeveler by broadcasting an
excerpt in which the deposed Panamanian dictator spoke in Spanish
with a secretary for defense lawyer Frank Rubino.
   CNN decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the
excerpt early Saturday, Haworth said. Later Saturday, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld Hoeveler's ruling.
   The appeals court also told CNN to give the seven tapes to the
Miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would
endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges. That order was also stayed by today's agreement.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the invasion of Panama in December.
   Rubino asked Hoeveler to find the Atlanta-based network in
direct civil contempt and fine the network $300,000 for each time
it televised the tapes and each time it shows them in the future.
   CNN accused Hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself
from the case.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York constitutional lawyer who served as
co-counsel for The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, said
the CNN case could set precedent because rules involving prior
restraint have been very clear through the years.
   ``We've almost totally banned prior restraint,'' Abrams said.
``If the Supreme Court were to uphold the prior restraint order on
CNN, this would be the first time in our country's history that any
such court order had been affirmed by the court.''
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the U.S. Supreme Court said
the government could not bar publication of classified documents
about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Times appealed rather than
defy a lower court order.
   George Rahdert, a lawyer at the Poynter Institute of Media
Studies, called the CNN case ``an astonishing illustration of
censorship,'' but said the network was ``playing with blasting
caps'' by defying the judge's order.
   ``It's rare in general that a news organization of any kind -
broadcast, cable or print - would do such a thing,'' said Rahdert,
who represents several newspapers. ``It really falls into the
category of civil disobedience.''
   CNN president Tom Johnson said the case is a classic
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover.
   He said the district court and appeals court construed the case
as a conflict between the Sixth Amendment, which provides a
defendant a right to a fair trial, and the First Amendment, which
provides for freedom of the press.
   ``There's a more fundamental issue here: reporting the news of
possible governmental misconduct,'' Johnson said. ``If CNN can be
restrained from airing news about the Noriega tapes, so can any
news organization.''
