   CNN has decided to allow court transcripts of its
Manuel Noriega prison tapes to be made public without further legal
battles, the network and its attorney said Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ruled Tuesday the
transcripts could be released Thursday, unless CNN decided to take
the case to a higher court.
   ``CNN has decided not to appeal,'' network attorney Terry
Bienstock said, adding that CNN's primary concern had always been
to protect its confidential source.
   ``We don't think the transcripts in and of themselves will
jeopardize the source,'' he said.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said many of the conversations were
in code, and that without supporting documents, they would not be
meaningful in any case.
   Sanford Bohrer, attorney for four media organizations that asked
for the transcripts, applauded CNN's decision.
   ``I think it was the right decision because Judge Hoeveler's was
the right decision,'' Bohrer said. ``I could never understand how
CNN could claim to own conversations that were taped by the United
States government, of an inmate in a federal prison.''
   The news organizations seeking the tapes were The Miami Herald,
The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami,
Gannett Co. Inc. and USA Today, which Gannett owns. They argued the
public has a right to examine the content of tapes that set off a
free-speech controversy that went to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   CNN has televised some of the seven tapes at issue and argued
that the recordings, and therefore the transcripts, were its
property. CNN accused other news organizations of ``professional
jealousy,'' and said the transcripts should be burned or returned
to the network.
   But the judge's decision ruled the tape transcripts were public
documents because the information was originally compiled by
Noriega and the government, not CNN.
   The tapes controversy began last month when CNN aired a series
of telecasts based on Noriega's telephone conversations somehow
leaked to the network. The judge ordered the telecasts stopped
pending his review of he tapes, a move CNN opposed as
unconstitutional prior restraint of the press.
   The Supreme Court decided not to intervene, and the judge, after
reviewing the transcripts, determined there was no threat to
Noriega's right to a fair trial and said the tapes could be aired.
   CNN hasn't said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration, and that
Panamanians gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing through Panama from
Colombia to the United States.
