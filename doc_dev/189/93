<HEAD>Backers of Cable Controls Vow Tougher Bill Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of legislation to re-regulate cable
television prices and services say they'll be back next year with
an even tougher bill following a defeat in the Senate.
   On Sept. 28, Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., objected to bringing
the bill to the floor for debate or a vote, where it was expected
to pass easily. Faced with a possible filibuster, a sponsor of the
bill, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, declared the measure ``dead and
buried'' for the 101st Congress.
   Congress is expected to adjourn as early as the middle of
October.
   Backers of the bill said that the cable industry's victory might
be short-lived and that it would only strengthen the hand of
would-be competitors.
   Home satellite companies are itching to compete with cable and
are expected to push provisions of the Senate bill that would
guarantee them access to cable programming. Broadcasters also want
cable to pay for the programming it now takes virtually for free.
   ``There may come a time when the cable industry will devoutly
wish they had taken today's deal,'' said Edward O. Fritts,
president of the National Association of Broadcasters.
   The Office of Management and Budget had issued a veto warning on
the bill, which would have restored some of the government
oversight of cable that Congress lifted in 1984.
   OMB said that the bill imposed too many restrictions on cable
and that increased competition - perhaps from the telephone
industry - was the answer to any problems in the cable industry.
Basic cable prices on average have risen 43 percent in the past
three years.

<HEAD>Networks Use Saddam Tape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The four major U.S. television networks
broadcast all or parts of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
videotaped address to the American people.
   Saddam gave his side of the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait in a
75-minute address, sitting at his desk with an Iraqi flag at his
side.
   The Sept. 25 broadcast was in Arabic, the remarks translated
with English subtitles supplied by Iraq.
   The networks broadcast excerpts of the tape on their evening
news shows.
   Saddam had asked that they show the entire tape. Only CNN
scheduled the whole thing, for 1 a.m. EDT the next morning. The
network said it was not honoring Saddam's request, but making an
independent decision.
   ``We did not decide until 6:30 p.m. . . . after seeing the whole
damned thing and only after seeing the whole damned thing,'' said
CNN spokesman Steve Haworth.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Denied Meeting With Mohawks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson was prevented from meeting with
Mohawks holed up in a drug and alcohol detoxification center in
nearby Kahnesatake on Sept. 25, a day before the standoff ended.
   Canadian military officials said Jackson, who is host of a
syndicated television show, was being treated like any other
journalist when he was refused entry to the center.
   Jackson was accompanied to the reservation, about 18 miles west
of Montreal, by Kahnawake Mohawk Chief Joe Norton.
   ``The Mohawks in the detoxification center cannot get spiritual
or legal advice and, moreover, the Canadian and the world press is
denied access to them,'' Jackson said. ``This is undemocratic and
inconsistent with Canada's great history.''
   Canadian forces surrounded the treatment center Sept. 1 after
about 50 Mohawks, some armed, occupied the building. The standoff
ended Sept. 26 when the 22 people remaining inside left. Several
scuffles broke out as some of the Mohawks refused to submit to
questioning afterward. There were no serious injuries.

<HEAD>CBS Remembers Quake and Packs Generator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS is determined not to be shaken if
there is a replay of last year's World Series earthquake.
   The quake rocked San Francisco's Candlestick Park, where the
third game of the 1989 World Series was just getting under way last
Oct. 17.
   ABC, which broadcast the championship series last year, didn't
have a backup power supply and lost all video from the stadium for
about 30 minutes.
   CBS promises it won't be caught in the dark during upcoming
playoff American League Championship Series telecasts from Oakland.
   The network will lug a generator to the Coliseum for a standby
power source in the event of a disaster similar to last season's
temblor.
   ``We will be self-sufficient in Oakland,'' said producer Rick
LaCivita. Playoff games are scheduled in Oakland Oct. 9, 10 and 11.

<HEAD>Jane Pauley Gets New Contract, Mid-Season Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jane Pauley has a new five-year contract with
NBC and is assured a new midseason series, the network said Sept.
24.
   The series' title, ``Real Life With Jane Pauley,'' also was the
title of five Pauley specials broadcast in prime time this summer.
All did well in the ratings, averaging a 21 percent share of the
audience, NBC said.
   Terms of the new contract weren't disclosed. Pauley, who turns
40 on Oct. 31, left ``Today'' in December after a series of changes
and turmoil there led to her departure. She was succeeded as
co-anchor by Deborah Norville.
