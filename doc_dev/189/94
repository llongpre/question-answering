   NBC plans to offer a 24-hour news service along
the lines of Cable News Network to its affiliate stations.
   The plan, which would let affiliates use the service for their
own broadcasts or when NBC is not broadcasting, could put NBC in
head-to-head competition with CNN; 51 of NBC's 208 affiliates also
are affiliated with CNN.
   NBC News President Michael Gartner said in a statement Monday
that many details have yet to be worked out. The network hopes to
unveil the service at the NBC affiliates' annual convention June
3-6 in Washington.
   The new service, according to one published report, could cost
$2 million to start and $8 million a year to run.
   James R. Sefert, chairman of the NBC affiliates' board,
characterized the idea as an extension of an NBC service called
A-News, which sends affiliates reports from NBC News and the
network's affiliates.
   He said he had seen no details of the plan but that based on NBC
officials' description, ``I think it's terrific.'' However, Sefert,
president of Cosmos Broadcasting Corp. in Greenville, S.C., said he
didn't know enough about the plan to say whether NBC-affiliated
stations would approve.
   ``We are still studying it,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said
of NBC's plan. ``But we've developed very strong relationships with
220 broadcast affiliates over the 10 years that we've been in
business.
   ``We're certainly confident that those relationships will
persist.''
   Michael J. Corken, vice president and general manager of WTHR in
Indianapolis and head of the news subcommittee of the NBC affiliate
board, said he doesn't know whether he would drop CNN if NBC came
up with a similar service.
   ``I'd have to look and see what the viability of the
NBC-proposed system would be,'' he said.
   NBC in 1985 tried to buy 51 percent of CNN but failed because of
its insistence that NBC News have editorial control of any NBC-CNN
operation that would result.
   NBC's plan could become the first major network news push
against CNN in the pre-dawn hours since the early 1980s, when there
was the short-lived ``NBC News Overnight'' and CBS News'
``Nightwatch.''
   NBC's service would be separate from the network's regular
newscasts.
