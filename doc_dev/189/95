<HEAD>CNN, Once Called ``Chicken Noodle News,'' Celebrates 10th Year
Today</HEAD>

   It began 10 years ago today with 300 employees,
$400 million in start-up costs and 12 bureaus. But critics who
laughingly called it `Chicken Noodle News'' then are eating crow
now.
   Ted Turner's Cable News Network, originally seen in only 1.7
million U.S. homes, now is in 54 million. It has nearly 1,800
staffers and 27 bureaus worldwide and is seen in 90 countries,
including the Soviet Union. And it became profitable in 1985.
   That the 24-hour network is a global presence as well as a
big-league rival of the news divisions of ABC, CBS and NBC was
neatly noted during the U.S. invasion of Panama in December.
   NBC's Tom Brokaw, interviewing a Panama City resident by phone
for ``Today,'' asked if a TV station there was describing what was
going on.
   ``Well,'' the man replied, ``they're actually relaying the CNN
broadcast.''
   Such recognition, by either a man in Panama or world leaders,
was an uncertain dream when Ed Turner _ no relation to Ted _
reported for duty at CNN's temporary offices in Atlanta six months
before operations began.
   Battle stations were in an ancient building resembling, well, an
ideal fixer-upper. Turner, now CNN's executive vice president,
recalls that ``it looked like something off of Tobacco Road, only
not that nice.''
   Turner is a veteran of more than 20 years in news, including a
stop at CBS, where he produced the ``CBS Morning News.''
   He was running an Oklahoma City station when CNN beckoned.
   ``They said, `Come on down and try,''' says Turner, a native
Oklahoman with a deadpan sense of humor. ``And who could say no to
something that everybody said was going to be a sure failure?''
   Ted Turner himself became a recruiter, according to a new book,
``CNN: The Inside Story.'' It says he tried to hire ... Walter
Cronkite. The famous, respected then-CBS anchorman politely and
indirectly said no.
   Lesser news stars who nonetheless also were respected said yes.
   They included two who became the best-known of CNN's original
anchors: Mary Alice Williams from New York's WNBC-TV _ she returned
to NBC last April _ and Bernard Shaw, a no-nonsense former Marine
from ABC who still is at CNN in Washington.
   When he joined CNN, had he any feelings he might be joining the
crew of television's Titanic? ``No,'' Shaw says, ``I'm a good
swimmer.''
   Network news still was riding high and considered The Place to
Work when Ed Turner joined CNN. But he found few cries of ``you
must be mad'' when recruiting CNN's grunts _ reporters, producers,
writers, bureau chiefs.
   ``Generally, they were interested,'' he says. ``It was trying to
sell the wife, or the husband, as the case may be. But the desire
to gamble was considerable among the journalists. A lot of them
said, `Why not?'''
   The arguments against were considerable: low pay, long hours, no
unions where possible and the distinct chance that at any minute
the whole shebang might go poof. Indeed, CNN lost $16 million its
first year.
   But local TV news had burgeoned in the 1970s, Turner notes, and
many younger local newsies were ready for the majors. But the
networks were full up.
   ``We came along at the right time,'' he says.
   The new arrivals, he says, ``hadn't been tainted by exposure to
the other networks, where in those days they had so much help and
logistical support, and so many nice limousines, it'd ruin you from
remembering to go out and get a story.''
   The hardest part, he says, was getting recognition, from
advertisers, newsmakers and viewers. That long since has been
solved, particularly among Washington's movers and shakers.
   It wasn't always so in that hamlet, one of the last major cities
to get cable. That's why CNN in its early days gave away satellite
dishes to the White House, the Pentagon and the House and Senate,
says Turner.
   But he thinks the real turning point came at the 1984 Democratic
convention in San Francisco, when CNN got a booth, just like the
Big Three, overlooking the convention floor:
   ``That to me,'' he says, ``was a symbol of `There's a new
big-time player around, folks.'''
   That player now isn't seen only on cable or what it says are
950,000 hotel rooms _ 700,000 in the U.S. and Canada and the
balance abroad.
   Some of its reports also are seen on the news programs of 250
U.S. stations that are CNN affiliates, Turner says. Significantly,
the majority _ 160 _ also are network affiliates.
   But Turner, while he enjoys needling the networks, doesn't
believe the nightly network newscasts that once ruled the national
news roost are going the way of the pterodactyl _ at least not all
three.
   ``I think that they will survive in some form, perhaps not as
formal half-hours, but as update services or feeds to their
affiliate stations. One or two may continue (in their present
form). But they have to find a new editorial presentation.''
   That, he says, is because it is a different game now, with CNN
going strong and many local news operations airing national and
international reports before Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan
Rather start their newscasts.
   As Turner sees things, a big problem for the Big Three is that
``the surprise factor _ the `Hey, Martha, come here and look' _ is
gone.''
