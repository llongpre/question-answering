   NEW YORK -- A non-profit foundation will award a $3.5
million grant to Cable News Network to help pay for CNN's
coverage of the 1992 presidential campaign.
   The John and Mary R. Markle Foundation is expected to
announce tomorrow that it will donate the money to CNN, the
24-hour channel owned by Turner Broadcasting System Inc.

   Markle President Lloyd N. Morrisett said CNN will have
complete editorial control over coverage, but will have to
provide the foundation with data showing how it used the
money to cover the campaign.
   The move comes three months after the Markle Foundation,
with assets of about $100 million, abruptly withdrew a
planned $5 million donation to the Public Broadcasting
Service, which was charting an ambitious election-year
effort. Mr. Morrisett cited "turmoil" within the PBS system
and said at the time, "The prospects were dim for a
successful project which lived up to its promises of which we
could all be proud."
   PBS subsequently announced a scaledback election year
plan. It also has agreed to team up with General Electric
Co.'s NBC News to cover the Republican and Democratic
national conventions next summer.
   This is the first time the Markle Foundation has had an
association with a commercial entity. "CNN is the only
television organization which has devoted itself totally to
news coverage. They have already demonstrated it is devoted
the public interest," the foundation's Mr. Morrisett said.
CNN agreed to leave its election-year budget intact and forgo
any spending cuts if awarded the extra money.
   CNN is billing itself as "America's Campaign
Headquarters," taking a dig at the three broadcast networks
which it says "have announced a drastic reduction in
coverage. It's as if they've hung up their hats, just as
we've thrown ours in the ring."
