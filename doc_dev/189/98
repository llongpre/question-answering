   The National Broadcasting Co., operator of
the top-rated television network in prime time, takes a bold step
into cable TV Monday with the debut of a 24-hour consumer-oriented
business news channel.
   CNBC, the Consumer News and usiness Channel, will be available
to 13 million cable subscribers, or roughly one out of seven U.S.
households with television and one in three with cable service.
   The cable operators who have signed up for the round-the-clock
service say NBC brings a wealth of programming experience and they
contend the entire cable industry will benefit.
   But other cable operators are waiting to see the new network in
action before committing themselves, and cable rival Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. suspects NBC's long-range cable plans go
beyond just business news.
   In any case, the debut at 6 a.m. EDT Monday promises to be the
second most successful cable launch, trailing only Turner's TNT
channel, which offers mostly movies and started with 17 million
subscribers last October. TNT now claims 26 million subscribers.
   CNBC's one-hour morning show will be hosted by Dave Walker and
Lois Hart, the husband-and-wife team that had hosted the
Turner-owned Cable News Network's prime evening news for nine years.
   CNBC also will feature half-hourly market reports, interviews
with money managers, consumer-product demonstrations and buying
tips.
   At night, the ``CNBC Live'' program will follow a format similar
to the network's morning show. Also planned are a personal finance
show with a studio audience and calls from viewers and interview
shows hosted by Dick Cavett and political analyst John McLaughlin.
   ``CNBC Live'' contributors will range from legal expert Arthur
Miller to Ferdie Pacheco, the ring physician of boxing great
Muhammed Ali.
   On weekends, CNBC will air original programming aimed at women
and children mixed with weekly wrapups.
   This won't be the first broadcast company involvement in cable,
but it may be the most active connection between broadcast and
cable.
   The owner of the ABC network has stakes in the ESPN, Lifetime
and Arts &amp; Entertainment cable networks. NBC also has a passive
investment in Arts &amp; Entertainment.
   Larry Gerbrandt, a cable industry analyst for the research firm
Paul Kagan Associates Inc., based in Carmel, Calif., said the CNBC
experience may demonstrate ``how finely can we slice up a niche and
still make money.''
   Gerbrandt estimates NBC will spend $50 million to $75 million
before CNBC becomes profitable, a development that CNBC executives
expect by 1993, when they hope to have about 30 million subscribers.
   If CNBC succeeds, Gerbrandt said ``it may be that consumers are
ready for more narrowly targeted networks'' that will further
strain channel capacities for many cable operators.
   NBC President Robert Wright's interest in the cable business was
well-known long before the company announced last spring that it
planned the new network.
   The original strategy called for daytime business news and
sports at night and on weekends, drawing on NBC's vast resources in
gathering information.
   Analysts noted that it would enable NBC to spread the costs of
news-gathering and sports rights over a broader base wile helping
the network recapture audiences that all three networks have been
losing to cable and independent television stations.
   NBC's cable venture also reflects a broader trend toward
diversification in the media business. Time Inc., Hachette SA of
France and News Corp. of Australia have been seeking new outlets as
well.
   But NBC's initial plan for sports was eventually eliminated from
the CNBC project after cable operators told NBC they had enough
sports programming, CNBC President Michael Eskridge said.
   That left business news, and NBC executives felt their
consumer-oriented, full-time approach would be unique.
   There already was one competitor, the Financial News Network,
but Eskridge said FNN's programming appeared targeted at investors
who follow the markets.
   Richard Feldman, director of research for NBC's cable
subsidiary, said NBC was more interested in appealing to the
estimated 50 million adults who use banking services but don't own
securities.
   Business news shows on cable and broadcast outlets have
multiplied in recent years, ranging from public television's The
Nightly Business Report to CNN's Moneyline.
   Eskridge described CNBC's role this way: ``Everyone does what we
do some of the time. We will do it all the time.''
   His crew will be doing it from two studios in a new office
building located in this New Jersey suburb, a 45-minute taxi ride
from NBC's midtown Manhattan headquarters.
   CNBC eventually will employ 275 staffers, draw occasionally on
reports from NBC network staffers and NBC affiliate stations and
operate its own offices in Washington, Tokyo, London and at the
American Stock Exchange on Wall Street.
   NBC had a powerful ally in Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cable system operator, which has interests in
systems with more than 11 million subscribers.
   Tele-Communications agreed to lease a satellite channel for
CNBC. Robert Thompson, a Tele-Communications executive, said his
company also is contributing several million subscribers to the
charter group of CNBC subscribers, but would not be more specific.
   CNBC got another lift when it agreed on a joint venture with
another big cable system operator, Cablevision Systems Corp., that
would pool NBC's business channel with the nine sports, news and
entertainment programming services of Cablevision's Rainbow
Programming unit. NBC runs CNBC in the deal.
   But Marquest Research, a North Carolina-based concern that
surveys major cable operators, said it found only limited support
for CNBC outside the cable systems in which Tele-Communications and
Cablevision had an interest.
   ``The others are saying they want to see what the service looks
like,'' said Marquest executive Paul Rule. ``There is a concern
that it may be a duplication of what is being done by (Turner's)
Headline News or FNN.''
   Some operators are taking both CNBC and FNN.
   David Meister, who heads FNN, said he expects only ``a minor
defection of a few percent'' from the FNN subscriber base of nearly
33 million because of the arrival of CNBC and suggests the two
networks can co-exist. ``The casual viewer is not going to be
satisfied by us or vice versa,'' he said.
   Turner Broadcasting, which runs CNN, Headline News and
Superstation WTBS besides TNT, is less sympathetic. NBC reportedly
considered buying a piece of CNN a few years ago and later
considered starting its own cable news network.
   Turner executives believe NBC intends to compete against them as
a general news cable network and that CNBC is only a way to get in
the door.
   CNBC's Eskridge denies that, but Turner executive Arthur Sando
said his company will be watching. ``We have had competition before
and we are not afraid of competition,'' he said.
