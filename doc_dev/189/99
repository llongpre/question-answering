   Turner Broadcasting System Inc., Atlanta, said it sold a new class of preferred stock in its Cable News Network Inc. unit for $154 million. 

   The broadcasting concern issued about 2.2 million shares of the stock in a private placement at $71.61 a share. 
Proceeds from this 11 1/2% cumulative exchangeable preferred will be used to redeem all of the company's extendible notes, which currently carry a 17% interest rate. 

   The preferred stock in CNN, perhaps Turner's most valuable cable-television operation, enables the subsidiary to ease the debt burden of the parent. 
CNN previously had no debt on its books, while the parent has about $1.4 billion of debt. 

   The buyer or buyers of the stock weren't disclosed, but the company said last week it expected institutional investors to own the stock. 
Dividends on the CNN preferred will accrue over the next three years. 
If not redeemed by company within that period, the dividends thereafter are payable quarterly at a 21.5% annual rate.
