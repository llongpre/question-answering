   Bureaucratic and technical problems have stalled the plans
of two U.S. broadcasters to expand program services in Asia.
   Three months ago, the 24-hour news service Cable News
Network International and the sports network ESPN
International announced the expansion of broadcast services
in Asia under an agreement to lease space on Indonesia's
Palapa satellite. But the new service -- bringing news and
sports programming into hotels and homes throughout Southeast
Asia on a subscription basis -- is still on hold and the
broadcasters are considering other options.

   The two plan to share satellite space, but will operate
independently. CNN is a unit of Turner Broadcasting System
Inc.; ESPN is 80%-owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
   CNN and ESPN want to send their broadcast signals to
Palapa from a ground station in Indonesia, but government
authorities have refused to comply and have refused to
explain their decision, according to Andrew Brilliant, ESPN's
senior vice president and general manager. "We don't
understand why the government is resisting. It's a big
mystery to us," he said in a phone interview from Jakarta,
Indonesia.
   Even so, Mr. Brilliant said he was confident that the
service will come on line by mid-1992. "The only question is
from where" to link with the satellite, he said.
   Officials of Indonesia's Information Department, one of
the government bodies responsible for the decision, couldn't
be reached for comment.
   Peter Gontha, a director of Bimantara Citra Group, which
was selected by the two broadcasters to assist in marketing
and distributing the new service, said about the problem:
"It's a pity Indonesia doesn't allow it. We see foreign
exchange going to other countries," referring to spending
associated with the broadcasting business.
   On Thursday, ESPN and CNN announced the selection of their
partner in the project, PT Matahari Lintas Cakrawala. The
company is a unit of Bimantara, which is led by the second
son of Indonesia's President Suharto.
   The U.S. broadcasters are faced with finding another
government in Asia willing to provide a ground station.
"We're looking at several markets in the region and we hope
to make an announcement shortly," Mr. Brilliant said.
   But analysts familiar with Asia's rigid regulatory
framework in the area of broadcasting and telecommunications
say finding a government willing to assist CNN and ESPN could
be difficult.
   CNN and ESPN currently deliver their programming to Asia
on a satellite operated by the International
Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or IntelSat, based
in Washington, D.C. The CNN signal can be received by anyone
in Asia with a satellite dish that is at least 7.5 meters in
diameter. The ESPN signal is encoded and is available only to
viewers who pay for the service. "We intend to utilize
{IntelSat} to hotels until such time as we can utilize
Palapa," Mr. Brilliant said.
   Both groups have expressed an interest in expanding their
broadcast service in Asia as more powerful satellites become
available. Palapa covers much of Southeast Asia and transmits
a signal that can be received by anyone owning a dish as
small as 2.5 meters in diameter. However, in accordance with
Indonesian broadcasting laws and in an attempt to cut down on
the number of hotels that get service without paying for it,
the U.S. broadcasters plan to scramble the Palapa signal.
   In a written response from CNN's headquarters in London
last month, a company spokeswoman said CNN had complied with
all Indonesian regulatory guidelines. CNN has refused to
acknowledege Indonesian bureaucratic tangles, instead
pointing to purely technical hurdles for stalling the new
service. However, the CNN spokeswoman did say that sites
outside Indonesia are under consideration.
