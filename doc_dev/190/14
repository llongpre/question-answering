   Manuel Noriega and Cable News Network declared a
cease-fire Monday, agreeing to postpone their constitutional
showdown over taped conversations until the U.S. Supreme Court
rules on the issue.
   Under the deal is worked out in federal court, CNN must refrain
from playing any tapes between the imprisoned former Panamanian
leader and his attorneys.
   In return, Noriega's defense delayed a request for contempt
penalties of up to $300,000 per broadcast against the network. U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler also delayed his order demanding
that CNN hand over seven disputed tapes to the court.
   ``Our concern is to keep General Noriega from being denied a
fair trial,'' defense attorney Jon May said. ``I'm not here to
squeeze blood out of CNN.''
   He said suspending the contempt proceedings will allow the
Supreme Court to focus on the broader constitutional question
balancing protections of the attorney-client privilege and freedom
of speech.
   Noriega's attorneys Saturday asked the judge to find CNN in
contempt after the network defied his court order and televised a
contested tape.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the deal,
but had the right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they did
not include conversations with his attorneys. The judge agreed.
   The Atlanta-based network is expected to file its appeal to the
Supreme Court later in the week, a CNN spokesman said.
   ``We agreed that CNN would not air, pending Supreme Court
review, any attorney-client conversations that it has in its
possession,'' network attorney Terry Bienstock said. ``We just want
the issues to be narrowly and properly framed before the Supreme
Court.''
   Federal prosecutors have remained on the sidelines during the
CNN-Noriega dispute, but U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Monday
he supports the gag order.
   ``These tapes should not be played under the fair-trial
concept,'' Lehtinen told the judge.
   May said Monday's deal stops the clock on the contempt
penalties, but does not prevent the defense from later asking for
fines against CNN.
   Although attention has focused on the media, May said there are
also other potential parties to the dispute.
   ``There's a whole bunch of people in the U.S. who may have these
tapes, including the State Department and the CIA,'' he said. Lead
Noriega attorney Frank Rubino has said the tapes were leaked to CNN
by a Panamanian official who received them from the State
Department.
   Rubino has said he expects to ask for dismissal of all charges
against Noriega based on government misconduct in recording the
calls made from the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
   Hoeveler endorsed the deal, but took note of CNN's one-day
defiance of his previous gag order. He emphasized that over the
weekend the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta backed
his original ban on broadcasting the conversations.
   ``If you play any tapes in violation of my order, you are
violating not only my order, but also the appeals court order,''
Hoeveler said.
   CNN had defied the order by broadcasting an excerpt Friday night
and Saturday in which the deposed Panamanian ruler spoke in Spanish
with a secretary for Rubino. On the tape, Noriega speculated that
the government would use as witnesses against him two men who
surrendered to U.S. troops in Panama.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held near Miami
since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly after the invasion of
Panama in December.
