   A federal judge, frustrated by delays in paying
Manuel Noriega's attorneys, said today he will appoint two
government-paid defense attorneys if their fee problem is not
resolved by Friday.
   ``It is obvious that we simply may not be able to unfreeze any
money,'' U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said during a hearing
on the fees.
   In June, Hoeveler ordered prosecutors to unfreeze about $6
million in 27 Noriega-linked bank accounts for use by the Noriega's
private lawyers.
   But five months later, defense lawyers have not received a
penny, and today they asked Hoeveler to light a fire under the U.S.
government and banks in France, Switzerland and Austria, to release
the funds.
   But Justice Department attorney Drew Arena told the judge that
the foreign governments had frozen the accounts for their own
investigations and have so far refused to release them despite the
U.S. government's request.
   The problem is the United States had alleged the money was drug
proceeds, but was now reversing course by asking that it be given
to Noriega, Arena said.
   ``It's rather, your honor, like trying to `unring' a bell,''
Arena said.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino accused the U.S. State
Department of undermining efforts to unfreeze the funds by
encouraging foreign governments to act on their own. Hoeveler,
however, said he was frustrated by the delays and wanted the case
to proceed as quickly as possible.
   The judge has agreed that the trial will not begin Jan. 28, but
said it will not be delayed by much.
   Under the law covering court-appointed counsel, the attorneys
could receive only a maximum of $60 an hour, far less than the $350
an hour Noriega's attorneys have said they needed.
   Meanwhile, Noriega and Cable News Network have agreed to let the
U.S. Supreme Court decide whether the deposed Panamanian dictator's
tape-recorded conversations with his lawyers can be broadcast.
   CNN aire excerpts of one tape over the weekend in defiance of
Hoeveler.
   The defense and the network agreed Monday to suspend their feud
until the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether CNN's free-press
rights outweigh Noriega's right to a fair trial. The network
planned to file the appeal this week.
   ``I will be interested in seeing what the Supreme Court will do
in this novel situation,'' Hoeveler said.
   The Atlanta-based network agreed not to play any of the disputed
tapes until the Supreme Court rules. In return, Noriega's defense
delayed a request for contempt penalties of up to $300,000 per
broadcast against the network, and Hoeveler stayed his order that
CNN hand over seven disputed tapes to the court.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network had the right to
play other Noriega tapes as long as they did not include
conversations with his attorneys. The judge agreed.
   CNN defied Hoeveler by broadcasting on Friday and Saturday an
excerpt of a tape in which Noriega spoke in Spanish with a defense
attorney's secretary, who translated for his defense team. On the
tape, Noriega speculated that the government would use as witnesses
against him two Panamanians in U.S. custody.
   Rubino has said he will seek dismissal of all charges against
Noriega, alleging government misconduct in recording the calls made
from the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside Miami.
   Noriega has been held there since his surrender to U.S. forces
shortly after the invasion of Panama in December. He is accused of
accepting $4.6 million in bribes to protect the cocaine trade.
