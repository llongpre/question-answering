   A federal judge extended a ban against broadcast of
taped conversations between Manuel Noriega and his attorneys, but
Cable News Network defied the order Friday by playing another
recording.
   In the tape, Noriega discussed two potential government
witnesses with his defense team, and speculated on the prosecutors'
strategy.
   CNN President Tom Johnson defended the broadcast, calling the
judge's order ``unconstitutional prior restraint.''
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler told CNN's attorneys he
would hold the network in contempt of court if the tapes were
played, but did not act immediately.
   In an interview with a CNN producer broadcast later Friday,
Hoeveler said that whether or not he will find the network in
contempt ``remains to be seen.''
   Noriega's attorneys, meanwhile, accused the U.S. State
Department and the Panamanian government of President Guillermo
Endara of being the source of the tapes leaked to CNN.
   ``We believe the State Department had obtained copies of the
tapes, and gave them to the Endara government,'' said Noriega's
lead attorney Frank Rubino. ``A high-placed person in the Endara
government then provided them'' to CNN.
   A State Department spokesman said the agency was aware of
Rubino's comments, but had no immediate reaction.
   Noriega is charged in a February 1988 indictment with accepting
$4.6 million in bribes to turn Panama into a way station for the
Medellin cocaine cartel's U.S.-bound drug shipments. He has been
held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami since
shortly after he surrendered in the wake of the December 1989 U.S.
invasion of Panama.
   The tape played Friday by CNN was a conversation between Noriega
and Rubino's secretary, who acted as a translator for the two men.
She tells him two more people have been arrested in Panama, and
says he should review their names to determine ``whatever they can
know about you.''
   The men apparently referred to in the tape were an Alfredo
Sanchez and Felipe Camargo, a Noriega loyalist now imprisoned in
Panama who had been the general's top liaison with the Cubans and
is believed to be cooperating with the U.S. government.
   ``It is very interesting because it shows their strategy,''
Noriega says. ``It says they are trying to induce any of the two of
them to testify before the court against me.''
   Other tapes played Friday were conversations between Noriega and
allies, including a discussion with his mistress' mother about the
transfer of $4 million, CNN said.
   Earlier Friday, Hoeveler extended for 10 days his order banning
CNN from using any portion of the tape that could compromise the
former Panamanian dictator's attorney-client privilege.
   ``I cannot conceive that the law of prior restraint is so
sacrosanct and so encompassing'' it would allow broadcasting a
confidential attorney-client conversation no matter how damaging to
the defense, Hoeveler wrote in his order.
   The judge has also told CNN to turn over the tapes to a federal
magistrate, but suspended that requirement after the network
appealed the gag order to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.
   Noriega attorney Jon May said he was preparing arguments to be
delivered in Atlanta Monday balancing the right of free speech
against the right to a fair trial.
   ``Right now we are on the cutting edge of the law in both the
First Amendment and the Sixth Amendment,'' May said Friday. ``This
could end up very quickly in front of the Supreme Court.''
   The U.S. Justice Department Friday was continuing its
investigation into whether the tapes were made by the Bureau of
Prisons and how they got into CNN's hands, said spokesman Doug
Tillett.
   The Justice Department said the Bureau of Prisons had the legal
right to tape such calls and does so routinely, but May said
Noriega's attorneys were assured their clients calls would not be
taped.
   ``If he asked the guard to call his lawyers, we had been led to
believe that those calls would not be recorded,'' May said. And he
noted that the prison knew when Noriega spoke to the attorneys,
because the guards, and not the prisoner, dialed the calls.
   Noriega's attorneys say they expect to ask for dismissal of the
charges against their client if they can prove misconduct in making
or handling of the tapes.
   The government of Panama, which in January had said its
shattered legal system could not properly try Noriega, says it is
now in a position to prosecute him if the U.S. case falls apart.
   ``In the case that the North Americans can't do it, we're going
to ask for him, and he will be judged in accord with Panamanian
law, because he committed many, many crimes,'' Endara said.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias said Noriega has ``very serious
charges against him'' in Panama.
   The Panamanian government has charged Noriega and at least seven
of his officers with looting the treasury.
