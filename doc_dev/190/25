   When CNN continued its coverage of recorded
telephone conversations of Manuel Noriega while appealing a federal
judge's order in the case Thursday, a former judge read the story.
   Catherine Crier, a former Texas District Court judge, was one of
several anchors telling viewers that CNN continued to broadcast its
first report on the jailed Panamanian dictator because U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler's ruling would amount to
unconstitutional prior restraint.
   Hoeveler issued a temporary injunction in Miami barring CNN from
broadcasting parts of recordings of Noriega's conversations with
his lawyers that could infringe on attorney-client privilege.
   CNN used excerpts from the jailhouse tapes Thursday morning,
repeated that during the day and said it planned to televise
another installment Thursday evening.
   The Atlanta-based cable news operation said it would appeal
Hoeveler's ruling.
   Ms. Crier, the youngest woman elected to Texas District Court,
was among the anchors explaining that CNN continued to repeat the
morning segment ``because it believes it has the right to do so
under the First Amendment.''
   CNN said Ms. Crier had nothing to do with the decision to
broadcast the story, and was reading the same commentary as other
anchors.
   CNN declined to allow her to be interviewed about the story's
judicial ramifications.
   Ms. Crier created a stir when she was hired at the 24-hour news
network in 1989 with no journalistic experience. She has said she
left the judgeship because courtroom competition ``may have
surpassed the notion of serving clients, of seeking justice.''
