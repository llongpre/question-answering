   A federal judge ruled today that court transcripts
of tapes acquired by CNN containing prison conversations of Manuel
Noriega should be made public, but he didn't release them
immediately.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler issued the decision after
four media organizations asked for access to the court documents
last week, saying the public had a right to know the factual basis
of a case that tested the constitutional limits of prior restraint.
   The judge said he would not release the transcripts until
Thursday to allow CNN time to appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said he did not immediately know
whether the network would appeal.
   Bienstock argued earlier that releasing the transcripts would be
an ``intrusion into the news-gathering and news-editing process.''
.
   In his 18-page decision, Hoeveler chided CNN for first fighting
to televise the tapes and then seeking to keep the transcripts from
being used by other news organizations.
   The judge said it ``comes as somewhat of a surprise to have CNN,
the forceful proponent of a free press operating without judicial
intervention, return to this court urging that the press and public
be denied a right of access to the very information which CNN has
argued is of immediate public interest.''
   Hoeveler dismissed CNN's contention that it owned the content of
the tapes, saying it was the U.S. government that monitored
Noriega's prison conversations and recorded them, not CNN.
   Karen Kammer, an attorney representing the four media
organizations said she was pleased with the ruling. The
organizations are The Miami Herald, The Associated Press,
Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA
Today, which Gannett owns.
   ``I think the court has recognized that the content of the tapes
does not belong to CNN, as we had argued,'' she said.
   Three weeks ago, CNN revealed it had obtained seven tapes of
phone calls made from Noriega's prison cell near here. Federal
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers, and that all
inmates are made aware of this practice.
   The fallen Panamanian dictator's attorneys went into court Nov.
8 after learning about the tapes and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to
play any that might interfere with attorney-client privilege. The
network played some portions of the tapes for a day, but withdrew
them when a federal appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote, forcing
CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review. Transcripts then
were prepared by court officials in Miami to aid Hoeveler and
attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents of the tapes.
   Last week, Hoeveler decided to allow CNN to broadcast the tapes
and returned them to the network, but they were not immediately
aired.
   CNN has not said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration and that
Panama gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.
