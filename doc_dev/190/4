   CNN said it is giving up the fight to prevent the
release of court transcripts of its Manuel Noriega prison tapes.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, ruling in favor of four
news organizations that demanded access to the transcripts, said
Tuesday they would be released today unless CNN appealed. On
Wednesday, CNN said it would not do so.
   ``CNN's main concern in opposing unsealing of the transcripts
has been to protect the integrity of agreements with sources,'' CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said.
   But after reviewing the transcripts, network officials decided
there was little danger of compromising those sources, he said.
   CNN has televised some of seven tape recordings of Noriega's
jailhouse conversations with his legal team and had argued that the
recordings of the telephone calls, and therefore the transcripts of
them, were its property.
   Sanford Bohrer, the attorney for the news organizations that
asked for the transcripts, applauded CNN's decision to drop the
fight.
   ``I could never understand how CNN could claim to own
conversations that were taped by the United States government, of
an inmate in a federal prison,'' he said.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges he took $4.6 million in
payoffs to allow safe shipment of cocaine through Panama to the
United States.
   The organizations seeking the transcripts were The Miami Herald,
the Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and
Gannett Co. and its USA Today. They argued that the public has a
right to examine the content of the tapes, which were at the center
of a freedom-of-the-press dispute.
   The controversy began last month when CNN aired a series of
telecasts based on the recordings, which it said were provided by
an anonymous source.
   Hoeveler ordered the telecasts stopped while he determined
whether the action threatened Noriega's right to a fair trial. CNN
opposed the move as an unconstitutional prior restraint on the
press, but the Supreme Court refused to intervene.
   Hoeveler eventually ruled that the tapes didn't jeopardize the
case and could be aired.
   CNN hasn't said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
have claimed they were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration, and that
Panama gave them to CNN.
