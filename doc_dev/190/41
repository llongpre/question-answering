The government's problem-plagued case against deposed dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega appeared Tuesday to be headed for a lengthy delay because of a shortage 
of funds to pay his defense attorneys and a judge's determination to find out 
who leaked taped conversations of the former Panamanian leader. 
</P>
<P>
At a court hearing, Justice Department officials told U.S. District Judge 
William M. Hoeveler that they have been unable to carry out the order he issued 
last June to unfreeze Noriega's overseas bank accounts to provide $4 million to 
$6 million for his legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler replied that he might have to choose court-appointed defense attorneys 
willing to work at much lower government wages, a development that he said 
would postpone the scheduled Jan. 28 start of Noriega's drug-trafficking and 
money-laundering trial. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the judge said that he might name a special prosecutor to 
investigate how Cable News Network last week obtained government tapes of 
Noriega's jailhouse phone calls to his lawyers and former associates. 
</P>
<P>
The statement followed a plea from Sam Burstyn, an attorney for co-defendant 
Luis A. del Cid, that the judge name a special prosecutor with subpoena power 
to determine why prison officials recorded attorney-client phone calls of 
Noriega and perhaps other defendants. He said that the inquiry should determine 
who had access to the recordings and who gave them to CNN. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler ordered the network last week to stop broadcasting the recordings, but 
CNN initially refused to comply. After the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals 
upheld Hoeveler's injunction, CNN said that it would appeal the matter to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the network agreed to stop the broadcasts when Hoeveler said 
he would postpone any sanctions against CNN until the Supreme Court issues a 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler promised to consider Burstyn's suggestion but said that he first 
wanted to give the FBI a chance to pursue an inquiry it launched last week into 
the tapes. If the FBI needs subpoena power, "they know where to come to get it, 
and I'll be happy to comply," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Noriega's legal fees, a top Justice Department official said 
that government lawyers have tried repeatedly to get Switzerland, France and 
Austria to reverse "freeze orders" imposed on Noriega's bank accounts at the 
department's request last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Drew C. Arena, director of the Justice Department's Office of International 
Affairs, said the department had sought the orders on grounds that more than 
$20 million held overseas by the Panamanian leader represented the illicit 
proceeds of narcotics trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at Hoeveler's insistence, the department started to reverse the process. 
"But it's a little like trying to unring a bell," Arena told the court. 
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign officials have maintained the freeze on grounds their own 
domestic laws provide for forfeiture of any drug money, unless U.S. officials 
certify that Noriega's funds are free of any such taint. "We, of course, cannot 
do that," Arena said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank A. Rubino, Noriega's chief defense lawyer, said he suspects but cannot 
prove that U.S. officials secretly had encouraged foreign nations to impose 
their own freeze to foul up the defense effort. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler said that he would act by Friday to appoint government-paid defense 
lawyers if the problem remains unresolved. Rubino said he could not afford to 
work for government legal fees of approximately $60 an hour. His own rates are 
$350 an hour, he said.
