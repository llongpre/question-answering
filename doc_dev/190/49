   Lawyers for Manuel Noriega headed for federal court
today for a hearing on whether the deposed Panamanian dictator
should be appointed a government-paid defense attorney, and also
sought to have the charges thrown out.
   Noriega's private defense team, led by Fran Rubino, had claimed
the U.S. government has sabotaged its work by freezing Noriega's
assets, leaving no money for legal fees.
   In what Rubino said may be one of his last acts in the Noriega
case, he filed a motion today to dismiss the charges, accusing the
government of a conspiracy to deny Noriega's rights to a fair trial
and effective legal counsel.
   The motion accuses the government of misconduct by taping
Noriega's prison phone calls with his attorneys. Cable News Network
reported last week that it had obtained tapes of such calls.
   The defense motion also accuses the prosecution of illegally
freezing his funds, and says an unidentified government witness
attempted to entrap the attorneys two months ago by soliciting a
bribe to change his testiony.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Tuesday set a deadline
of today for Noriega's lawyers and the prosecution to work out a
payment plan. Otherwise, he said, he will declare Noriega indigent
and appoint an attorney on the U.S. payroll.
   If declared indigent, Noriega would be allowed two attorneys
paid a maximum of $75 an hour and investigative expenses of a few
thousand dollars.
   By contrast, the Justice Department has 30 lawyers on the case
and is prepared to spend up $30 million to prosecute Noriega on
charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from Colombian cocaine
smugglers, Rubino said.
   The tight budget for indigent defendants makes it nearly
impossible for government-appointed attorneys to compete, said Yale
Kamisar, a law professor at the University of Michigan.
   ``You need investigators, you need experts ... to challenge the
government, to put them to the test,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Cable News Network has asked the U.S. Supreme Court
to overturn Hoeveler's ruling of last week prohibiting the
broadcast of taped jailhouse telephone conversations between
Noriega and his lawyers.
   On Thursday, the FBI, which is investigating how CNN obtained
the government tapes, seized tapes and papers that had been stored
in a CNN reporter's hotel room. The network claims the material was
improperly removed from the hotel room by security guards and has
demanded the FBI return it.
   Soon after the United States invaded Panama last December, the
Justice Department asked other countries to freeze 27 bank accounts
holding about $20 million in purported ill-gotten gains allegedly
controlled by Noriega.
   Hoeveler ordered about $6 million freed in June, but prosecutors
said the foreign governments then confiscated the money on their
own.
   Also at issue is $5.8 million in cash found by U.S. troops in
Noriega's offices in Panama. Prosecutors said that upon surrender
Noriega denied the money was his and that it was then turned over
to the Panamanian government.
   Rubino said Noriega never disavowed the money.
