   CNN got the scoop on Manuel Noriega's taped phone
calls but no longer has an exclusive on the story.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ruled Tuesday that
transcripts of the tapes will be made public Thursday unless CNN
appeals.
   He ruled in favor of four news organizations that had argued the
transcripts were part of the public record and that the public had
a right to know the facts behind a case that had tested the limits
of freedom of the press.
   CNN had sought to retain exclusive use of the tapes, accusing
the other news organizations of trying to steal their story.
   ``The content never was and never will be CNN's,'' said Sanford
Bohrer, an attorney for the four news organizations: The Miami
Herald, The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of
Miami and Gannett Co. and its USA Today.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network had not decided
whether to appeal.
   He said the judge broke new ground by deciding that material
used in closed court hearings could be made public.
   ``To the extent it benefits all media, CNN's pleased about
that,'' Bienstock said. ``But we still see this as a continued
breach of the news-gathering process, by allowing access to
information gathered under a promise of confidentiality.''
   CNN has broadcast some of the seven tapes and argued that the
recordings, and therefore the transcripts, were its property. The
network said the transcripts should be burned or returned to CNN.
   Hoeveler disagreed, saying CNN ``did not interview Noriega to
obtain the conversations, nor did it record the conversations.''
   The tapes contain conversations between the deposed Panamanian
dictator, who awaits trial on drug-trafficking charges, and his
defense team. His lawyers accuse the government of leaking the
recordings made by prison authorities.
   After CNN aired one of the tapes last month, Noriega attorney
Frank Rubino argued that the recordings violate Noriega's
attorney-client privilege, and Hoeveler on Nov. 8 barred the
network from further such broadcasts.
   But CNN aired a tape anyway the next day, saying the First
Amendment forbids prior restraint of the media.
   CNN stopped the telecasts after a federal appeals court upheld
the judge's ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court, on a 7-2 vote, refused
to intervene.
   CNN then submitted the tapes to Hoeveler, who had the
transcripts made. After all sides examined them in secret, the
judge found the tapes did not prejudice Noriega's defense and said
the network could air them.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.
