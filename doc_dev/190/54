   The Chinese government halted live American
telecasts from Beijing as troops closed in on hundreds of thousands
of protesters in Tiananmen Square.
   ``In my 20 years of news reporting I've never seen anything like
this,'' CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw said Friday night.
   ``Goodbye from Beijing,'' he said, signing off.
   Correspondents were able to continue reporting by phone.
   Authorities first stopped transmissions from the square, where
videotapes showed soldiers hitting protesters with nightsticks,
then stopped satellite transmissions altogether.
   Networks were reduced to showing maps and photographs of their
correspondents, who said they hadn't been personally threatened. It
was unclear whether the networks would be able to videotape for
later airing.
   The blackout occurred at the end of a week of coverage of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit and the accompanying protests.
   Chinese officials used Gorbachev's departure as justification
for the move.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev China visit is over,'' a Chinese official said
to CNN, translating a written order that had been requested by CNN.
``Now I'm here announcing that CNN should stop the movable earth
station and its transmitting frequencies right away.''
   An official at the Atlanta-based Cable News Network said crew
members were trying to negotiate with the Chinese government for
permission to resume news coverage.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said he did not think the CNN crew
was being ordered out of the country.
   Tapes showed CBS News anchorman Dan Rather preparing for a live
telecast from Tiananmen Square about 8:30 p.m. EDT, only to have
the picture turn to interference.
   Viewers saw the unusual sights of CNN and CBS producers haggling
with Chinese officials in hotel hallways and control centers.
   ``He must do what he must do,'' Rather told an interpreter as an
official stood by outside the Hotel Shangri-La. ``But I want him to
understand that I respectfully protest, as strongly as I can,
particularly since he doesn't have anything in writing to break a
written agreement with.''
   CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said the network had a contract to
broadcast for another 16 or 17 hours. CBS was able to broadcast
from the Hotel Shangri-La for a couple of hours after the Tiananmen
Square blackout.
   ``It's good television and it's good news,'' Dees said. ``We
were prepared to go to Beijing for the summit, and though the
protests were building up, nobody expected it to explode like
this.''
   Bill Baxter of NBC News said the network shared a satellite with
CNN and was unable to get a signal out of China. He said efforts to
book other satellite time were also stymied by the official
blackout.
   ABC had arranged for two satellite feeds Friday night but got
neither of them.
   In a live transmission from the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel in
Beijing, CNN showed a government official writing the official
order _ on a note pad provided by CNN editors _ to shut down the
broadcasts.
   The blackout came about an hour after martial law was declared
in parts of Beijing, including Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of
thousands of Chinese have been demonstrating for political reforms.
   CBS special reports interrupted the season finale of ``Dallas.''
The episode was shown delayed but in its entirety.
   ``We've had some calls, but we always get calls during
interrupts,'' Dees said.
