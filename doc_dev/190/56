COURT HEADS IN A DARK DIRECTION;

<P>
CNN RULING MEANS PRESS HAS LESS FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, ignoring its own precedents, has let stand a federal judge's 
gag order forbidding Cable News Network from broadcasting tapes of Manuel 
Noriega's jailhouse telephone conversations. The court offered no explanation 
for its stunning and potentially far-reaching decision. Its 7-2 vote, refusing 
both CNN's emergency request to lift the stay and its appeal on the merits of 
the gag order, means that for now at least the effort to deny CNN its right of 
free speech remains in force. 
</P>
<P>
Let there be no mistake about it. The ultimate loser in all this is the public, 
for it is the people's essential liberties that the First Amendment is intended 
to protect. 
</P>
<P>
The highest judicial authority in the land has approved the notion that a court 
can censor newspapers, magazines or broadcasters in advance of publication -- 
on a finding that the right to free speech may be outweighed by another claimed 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers call this form of censorship "prior restraint." The Supreme Court 
specifically considered it in a 1976 Nebraska case. At that time the court 
unanimously struck down a gag order issued by a Nebraska judge who sought to 
bar pretrial publication of an alleged murderer's confession. 
</P>
<P>
The judge thought publication might make a fair trial impossible. The Supreme 
Court held that this possibility was insufficient to justify prior restraint. 
The court said that gag orders may only be used as a last resort -- with judges 
obligated first to consider less drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William M. Hoeveler ordered CNN to stop playing the Noriega jailhouse 
tapes on the air due to the outside possibility that they might prejudice the 
former Panamanian dictator's right to a fair trial. But there was virtually no 
showing of need behind this order, or any apparent consideration that less 
drastic measures might suffice. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for himself and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 
the other dissenter to Sunday's decision, went right to the heart of the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our precedents," said Marshall, "make unmistakably clear that any prior 
restraint of expression comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption against 
its constitutional validity and that the proponent of this drastic remedy 
carries a heavy burden of showing justification for its imposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled 
with these teachings . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It's possible that Judge Hoeveler, after listening to the tapes in CNN's 
possession, will lift his gag order. Even then, a dangerous precedent allowing 
courts to temporarily silence the press will have been set, inviting judges to 
invoke prior restraint on the most problematical of claims. 
</P>
<P>
It's by no means inconceivable that "temporary" censorship could be used to 
deny the public timely information about official misconduct, financial 
manipulations, threats to public health and safety. Justice Marshall is right. 
This is a case of "extraordinary consequences for freedom of the press," and, 
by extension, for American liberties.
