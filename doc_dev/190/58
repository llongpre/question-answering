   Cable News Network asserted again Friday the FBI
wrongfully took a reporter's box of materials on the Manuel Noriega
case, but the network could not fully explain just how it ended up
in the FBI's hands.
   The FBI said it would not analyze the box's contents until
officials answer CNN's complaint.
   At a packed news conference at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, CNN
general counsel Steven Korn said the network has not seen a
subpoena or search warrant for the box, which was taken by FBI
agents Thursday after security officers removed it from the hotel
room of reporter Marlene Fernandez earlier this week.
   The hotel is housed in CNN's headquarters complex, and Korn
acknowledged that Turner Security, a CNN sister company, was aware
of the box's whereabouts before FBI agents removed it.
   Asked why Turner Security didn't call CNN about the box, Korn
said, ``That's a good question.''
   But Korn denied that CNN arranged the box's removal as a ruse.
   ``I am confident the general public will not be misled to think
that this is a ruse, because I know you are all good reporters and
you will accurately report that this is no such thing whatsoever,''
he said.
   There was no word Friday on whether the box's contents had
anything to do with CNN's legal battle over its attempt to air
audio tapes of government wiretaps of Noriega.
   Korn said he did not know whether the box's contents could
identify CNN's sources on the Noriega story, but said ``we don't
believe our ability to pursue this story has been compromised.''
   CNN President Tom Johnson said Friday he didn't know if the
recordings contained in the box were audio or video tapes, or if
they were the phone calls between Noriega and his legal team.
   ``We just know that there were notes, work papers and tapes''
related to CNN's coverage of the Noriega story, Johnson said.
   William Hinshaw, head of the FBI's Atlanta bureau, said Friday
his agency agreed to seal the box. He said he would not examine its
contents further until ordered to do so.
   Hinshaw said he saw some cassettes in the box but didn't know if
they were Noriega tapes.
   CNN would not tell reporters how to reach Ms. Fernandez, and an
FBI agent also came up empty when he showed up at CNN's Washington
bureau looking for her.
   Meanwhile, he said, CNN has protested the box's removal ``at the
highest level of the FBI'' and demanded its return. Korn maintained
that while he has not seen the contents of the box, it was the
``lawful property'' of CNN and Ms. Fernandez.
   ``The property was not the property of the hotel. It was not the
property of the FBI. It had not been abandoned,'' Korn said.
   Korn would not answer reporters' questions on how long the box
was in Ms. Fernandez' room, why it was there and not in the CNN
newsroom a short walk away, and why the box apparently was picked
up as abandoned property by security officers even though Ms.
Fernandez had not checked out of her room.
   CNN has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a federal
judge's order, issued last week, barring it from airing recordings
of conversations between Noriega and the fallen Panamanian
dictator's legal team.
   CNN's reports disclosing the existence of the the government
tapes prompted his lawyers to ask a judge to throw out the drug
charges against him.
   Korn said he had not received a response from Joseph Whitley,
the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, to a letter CNN sent ``demanding the
return of the tapes and that the materials in the box not be
reviewed or duplicated.''
   Whitley was out of town Friday. Messages left for his assistant,
Ray Rukstele, were not immediately returned.
   Korn said it wasn't clear yet how the FBI was notified about the
box. ``I don't know who called who. There was a discussion between
the FBI and Turner Security. It's unclear to me who initiated the
call.''
   ``The FBI did not initiate any call on that whatsoever. The call
on that was initiated by Turner Security,'' said Dick Hildreth,
assistant special agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office.
``Until they called us, we didn't know any such box existed.''
