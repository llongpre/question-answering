   When presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
addresses Hispanic voters in their own language, Cables News
Network can broadcast his words untranslated on its new
Spanish-language program.
   The language spoken by one-eighth of the U.S. population has
become part of the daily newsroom hum at the Headline News studios
in Atlanta, as CNN enters its fourth month of producing ``Noticiero
Telemundo-CNN.''
   ``It's a very ambitious undertaking for CNN to have gotten
into,'' said the program's executive producer, Marlene May. ``And
they're going full steam ahead. It's sort of like the sky's the
limit right now.''
   The twice-daily, half-hour newscast premiered in May with
on-scene coverage of the Moscow summit.
   It is the first time a major Enlish-language news organization
has entered the growing Spanish-language television market.
   But CNN's Spanish product is shown in this country on 18
Spanish-language stations owned by or affiliated with Telemundo
Group Inc., a Spanish network based in New York.
   CNN also sold the program in eight Latin American countries.
   Its main competitor is the newscast produced by Univision
Holdings Inc., a Spanish-language broadcast system that has been
around for some 25 years.
   The 25-member bilingual staff shares CNN's Headline News studio
in Atlanta and has access to the cable networks' English-language
news gathering resources worldwide.
   ``The resources of 1,600 CNN employees around the world are
available for them to use in Spanish if they choose,'' said Steve
Hayworth, spokesman for the Atlanta-based CNN.
   However, May stresses that the newscast is not just a
translation of CNN's English product.
   ``We've hired our own journalists _ everything from editors to
writers to anchors to reporters,'' she said. ``There's not a
translator on my staff.''
   Numbering more than 20 million, Hispanic Americans have become
the fastest growing minority market in the country. Among the half
who understand English, more than 50 percent still spend most of
their time watching Spanish-language television, according to a
survey cited in the trade journal Television-Radio Age.
   Advertisers spent $223 million on Spanish-language television
last year, up 23 percent from 1986 and nearly double the $118
million spent in 1984, the journal reported.
   ``There is obviously an important and large and affluent
marketplace of Spanish-speaking Americans,'' Hayworth said.
   Though CNN hasn't been on the air very long in Spanish, May said
she's pleased with the results of its first summer.
   ``We're ecstatic about the fact that we've kept up our audience
share and ratings in New York,'' she said, adding that the program
also has been doing well in Miami and Los Angeles, other cities
with large Hispanic populations.
   ``We try to do stories that we feel would really affect the
Hispanics ... most things related to health, children, education _
the dropout rate is a major problem among Hispanics,'' said May, a
native of Cuba.
   Jorge Gestoso, a co-anchor of the program, said it's important
for Hispanic journalists to see world events through the eyes of
their audience.
   ``When we covered the Republican National Convention, we tried
to focus on how what they were saying could affect the lives of
Hispanics,'' said Gestoso, who was born in Uruguay.
   ``It's vital, it's essential to have Spanish language news. The
audience is very different _ at least a portion of them speak only
Spanish or very little English,'' he said. ``There's a vital need
to let them understand what's going on in the world.''
