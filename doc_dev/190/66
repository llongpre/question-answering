   Cable News Network founder Ted Turner said Thursday
CNN's coverage, beamed worldwide, is U.S.-oriented because its
profits come from the United States, but added that television's
globalization has been a ``positive force.''
   Turner said his U.S.-based network plans to begin hiring local
nationals as reporters in overseas bureaus, but it would take time
because ``the vast bulk of our audience and profits come from the
United States, and we're convinced that Americans are used to seeing
Americans report the news.''
   CNN, the world's only 24-hour television news network, was
founded in 1980 and claims 150 million viewers in more than 75
countries.
   Turner said CNN has almost completed negotiations for the leasing
of satellite transponders that would make it the first television
network available to every country in the world 24 hours a day.
Actual local broadcasting would depend on contracts with local
television stations or cable systems.
   Responding to questions from journalists in Tokyo, Beijing, Hong
Kong and Jakarta during a satellite-transmitted WorldNet Dialogue
sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency, Turner acknowledged that
CNN was U.S.-oriented in its news coverage, but said ``that can't be
helped.''
   ``Even though we may be very U.S.-biased, when there is a major
story anywhere ... we do usually carry it,'' he said.
   A larger market in Europe allows CNN to tailor its programming
for the European audience, but for economic reasons it must supply
its regular domestic U.S. programming to Asia, Turner said.
   Asian viewers have complained about too many U.S.-oriented
features on the network such as local U.S. weather reports.
   In Japan, where CNN is broadcast late at night by TV Asahi, local
newscasters spend time after most reports, which are translated into
Japanese, commenting on the contents and explaining the differences
between U.S. and Japanese perspectives on the news.
   Kenji Koyama, co-director of CNN programs for TV Asahi, said the
Japanese station uses CNN to provide an alternative perspective on
world developments as well as for coverage of U.S. news.
   Turner said fears of a rapid globalization of television
broadcasting controlled by privately owned media based in a few
dominant nations were exaggerated.
   ``It will take a long time,'' he said. ``Very few companies are
interested in advertising all around the world. ... Satellites and
satellite television have brought the world closer together. I think
it's a positive force on balance.''
