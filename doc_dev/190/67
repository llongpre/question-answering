   HONG KONG -- Cable News Network and sports channel ESPN
International will use an Indonesian satellite to deliver
24-hour programming to home viewers throughout Asia.
   "It's a natural evolution in our Asian marketing
strategy," said a London-based spokeswoman for CNN, the
24-hour international news program owned by Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. of the U.S.

   It also marks the first time Jakarta has allowed overseas
programmers to use its satellites for regional broadcasting.
Two Indonesian Palapa satellites are currently in orbit over
Asia and are used primarily to assist the country's basic
telephone services. A third satellite is scheduled for launch
next April.
   In recent months, television companies around the world
have expressed interest in using a Palapa satellite to
deliver both domestic and regional programming. Insiders say
that in addition to CNN and ESPN, U.S.-based Home Box Office,
Singapore Broadcasting Corp. and TV New Zealand are
negotiating for space on one of the satellites. ESPN is
80%-owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Home Box Office is a
unit of Time Warner Inc.
   Industry observers say strong demand from these and other
broadcasters, coupled with a shortage of available satellite
space over Asia, is working in the Palapa system's favor.
"The more outside interest they {the Indonesian government}
can attract, the more they can hope to raise in revenues,"
said a telecommunications analyst.
   George Chapman, satellite-systems manager for Hong
Kong-based Business News Network, said the annual charge for
leasing a transponder on Palapa has increased from an
estimated $800,000 to $1.1 million in just three months. BNN
is a start-up financial-news service that hopes to use the
Palapa system when it begins programming later this year.
   Television firms in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the
Philippines already use the satellite to beam programming to
their own viewers, even though the signal can be picked up
illegally by viewers in neighboring countries. CNN and ESPN
programming, however, will be scrambled and will be available
to viewers by the end of this year by subscription only.
   The Palapa signal can be received by viewers who own a
satellite dish between two meters and five meters in diameter
and live in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Hong
Kong, the Philippines and Taiwan. Currently, private
ownership of satellite dishes in Malaysia and Singapore is
illegal; other countries require a permit for satellite
ownership. CNN subscribers also will need a decoder to
unscramble the signal, a device the company likely will
provide as part of the subscription.
   In the northern part of Asia, CNN and other U.S.
programmers will continue to broadcast their signal on a
satellite operated by U.S.-based International
Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or Intelsat, a
nonprofit satellite concern controlled by all member
countries.
   CNN has used Intelsat since it began marketing its service
to hotels and broadcasters in Asia four years ago. But the
Intelsat signal requires a dish at least 7.5 meters in
diameter. CNN spokesmen said the Palapa satellite was chosen
to reach home viewers who own the smaller-sized dish.
