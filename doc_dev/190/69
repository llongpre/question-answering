   Manuel Noriega on Friday pleaded to keep his
defense lawyers during a hearing to consider appointing
government-paid attorneys to represent him because of delays in
unfreezing his assets.
   ``I believed mistakenly I would have a fair trial,'' the deposed
Panamanian dictator said. ``I was made to believe that I could use
my funds to hire lawyers of my own choice.''
   Citing his military background, Noriega said his attorneys were
``armed with handguns and no support staff, while the prosecutor's
office has nuclear weapons.''
   ``I realize this case has implications to the highest levels of
the United States government, including the White House, and I also
realize that many forces are at work beyond your honor's control,''
Noriega said, explaining his fears about getting a fair trial.
   Noriega's private defense attorneys made a last-minute plea to
the judge to throw out the limit on fees in the Criminal Justice
Act.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler did not immediately decide
the issue but appeared unmoved. He said he had received indications
from ``some exceedingly fine criminal defense lawyers'' who were
willing to take the case under the low government fee schedule.
   Looking at Noriega, the judge sought to assure him that he would
get a fair trial.
   ``I want the defendant to understand he is not being cast adrift
by the court and by the judicial system,'' Hoeveler said.
   Noriega's lawyers, led by Frank Rubino, told the judge they
would have to abandon the case under conditions set by a law
governing court-appointed legal counsel.
   The 20-minute plea was Noriega's first extensive statement in
court since surrendering to invading U.S. troops in January. Clad
in his four-star general's uniform, he read in Spanish, speaking
forcefully but without raising his voice.
   He had appeared subdued in some recent hearings, but on Friday
smiled and waved to an acquaintance in the audience, and talked
animatedly with one of his attorneys.
   Earlier in the day, the private defense team filed a broad
motion asking dismissal of all drug charges against their client.
   Court papers argued that freezing Noriega's assets and taping
his phone calls from prison constituted government misconduct.
   Rubino also said an unidentified government witness had sought a
bribe to change his testimony, possibly in an ttempt to entrap the
defense.
   ``It is abundantly clear that the United States has engaged in
misconduct heretofore unimaginable,'' the motion said. ``Indeed,
the quality and degree of the government's crimes is unlike
anything seen since Watergate.''
   Earlier this month, Cable News Network reported it had audio
tapes of jailhouse telephone conversations between Noriega and his
defense team. Rubino protested that such monitoring of confidential
conversations, apparently by federal authorities, and any airing of
the tapes by CNN compromised his client's right to a fair trial.
   Hoeveler did not immediately rule on the dismissal motion.
   The fee controversy springs from U.S. efforts in the wake of
December's invasion of Panama to freeze 27 Noriega-linked bank
accounts holding about $20 million. U.S. prosecutors told foreign
governments in France, Switzerland, Austria and other nations that
the money was drug-related.
   After Noriega's capture and return to the United States, his
attorneys went to Hoeveler asking to withdraw from the case because
they had no money to pay fees or expenses.
   Instead, all sides initially worked out a deal for the
government to hire Rubino and his legal team for rates as high as
$350 an hour under the Criminal Justice Act. The 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, however, said there was no statutory authority
for those rates.
   The law allows only two or three attorneys paid no more than $75
an hour during the trial and $40 for preparatory work. In addition,
the law sharply limits expenses, with judges never granting more
than a few thousand dollars for investigators and research.
   After that rejection, Hoeveler took another route. He determined
that Noriega must have had legitimate income during his tenure as a
military officer and ordered the U.S. government to free about $6
million of the frozen funds. That money was to go into an escrow
account to pay legal expenses.
   But in the following five months, the Justice Department failed
to win the release of any money. Its attorneys told Hoeveler on
Tuesday that the foreign governments had initiated their own
confiscation actions, and balked at releasing the money.
   The best chance for Noriega's attorneys appeared to be $5.8
million in cash found by U.S. troops in Noriega's offices in Panama
during the invasion. But federal prosecutors say the money was
turned over to the new government of Panama because Noriega
initially denied ownership, a claim disputed by Noriega's defense.
   Noriega's defense and many independent legal experts have cried
foul over the money issue.
   Rubino said trying to defend Noriega on a restricted budget made
the case into David vs. Goliath.
   Legal scholars said the fact that the United States took away
Noriega's money, then gave him a severely limited legal defense,
would reflect badly on the nation's legal system.
   Noriega is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami on charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombia's Medellin cocaine
cartel.
