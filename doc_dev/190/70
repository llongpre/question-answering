<HEAD>Daily News Sues Strikers, Loses Major Advertisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News, fighting to keep advertisers and
circulation in the midst of a strike by union employees, sued 11
people for allegedly burning a delivery truck, stealing bundled
papers or attacking replacement drivers.
   Each of the three lawsuits filed in state court Nov. 20 seeks
$100,000 in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages.
They claim the defendants have hurt the paper's ability to do
business.
   On Nov. 23, one of the News' biggest advertisers, Macy's
department store, said it had dropped its ads in the paper.
   The News' two tabloid rivals, the New York Post and New York
Newsday, have reported large advertising and circulation gains
since the strike began Oct. 25.
   ``This is obviously all strike-related,'' Newsday spokeswoman
Chiara Coletti said.
   Newsday's Nov. 23 paper had 192 advertising pages, 24 more than
a year ago. The Post on the same day had 90 ad pages, 40 more than
last year's. The Daily News, which declined to comment on the
departure of advertisers, had 47 pages of advertising.
   Nine unions are striking the newspaper over what they term
unfair labor conditions.
   The Daily News has published every day since the strike began,
but many vendors have declined to sell it.
   It had a daily circulation of 1.09 million before the strike.
The newspaper said it is now printing 600,000 papers a day and
getting 400,000 to customers.
   New York Newsday officials said their paper's daily circulation
has risen from about 150,000 before the strike to about 340,000.
The paper's Long Island edition has a circulation of about 600,000.
   Post officials said their newspaper's circulation is up from
about 500,000 before the strike to between 700,000 and 750,000.
   The News' lawsuits filed in connection with the strike include
videotapes made by management, said John T. Sloan, vice president
for human resources.
   One lawsuit claims that a member of the striking drivers union
set fire to a truck outside the paper's Brooklyn printing plant.
   Another claims two Wall Street Journal drivers stole bundles of
the News that had been left off at a drop-off point by non-union
drivers.
   The third lawsuit accuses eight people of attacking non-union
drivers and independent distributors at a paper drop-off point.
   In a separate court action, strikers won a victory when U.S.
District Court Judge Jack B. Weinstein issued a temporary
restraining order Nov. 20 permitting striking pressmen to expand
pickets outside the Brooklyn plant.
   The pressmen complained management and police infringed on their
rights by confining pickets to side streets on either end of the
block-long plant.
   Strike leaders have complained that police have taken the
company's side in the dispute. On Nov. 19, union officials
presented Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown with a letter asking
that the department investigate ``growing hostility by police
officers against Daily News workers.''
   Daily News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson called the union
allegations outrageous.
   ``The police are just trying to preserve peace and justice,''
she said. ``They're out there trying to do their job. All around
them crimes are happening at the hands of the union.''
   A spokesman for the department said the cost of police staffing
plus overtime since the strike began was estimated at more than
$5.6 million. Police have recorded about 195 strike-related
incidents and made at least 89 arrests, said Officer Scott Bloch,
the spokesman. He said most of the incidents reported have involved
attacks on Daily News trucks and allegations of harassment of
vendors.

<HEAD>CNN Hands Over Noriega Prison Tapes to Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNN has turned over its tapes of Manuel Noriega's
jailhouse phone calls so that a federal magistrate can help
determine whether Noriega's right to a fair trial has been
jeopardized.
   The network handed over a briefcase full of tapes Nov. 20 after
the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler's temporary order barring CNN from airing the recordings.
   U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff will make and study transcripts
and report to Hoeveler, who will preside over Noriega's trial on
drug trafficking charges and will weigh a defense request to
dismiss the case.
   Hoeveler assigned Turnoff to listen to the tapes to avoid being
``tainted'' by having learned details of Noriega's defense
strategy.
   No time limit for reviewing the tapes was set, but Noriega's
lead attorney, Frank Rubino, said the judge guaranteed it would
done ``with dispatch.''
   Rubino also asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against CNN
for airing a conversation in alleged violation of the judge's
order. The judge did not immediately set a hearing, saying he must
await a decision by the chief judge of his judicial district on a
CNN request to remove him from the tapes case.
   CNN attorney Steven Korn wouldn't say how many tapes were turned
over. He would not discuss their contents or origins but said he
was confident that the judge will rescind the order not to
broadcast the tapes.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with matters protected by
attorney-client confidentiality - in part because Rubino tacitly
agreed to broadcasting them when he identified them on the air.
   Noriega has asked that the case against him be dismissed because
of the taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged
government misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed near Miami on charges of taking
bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't expected to
begin before the spring.
