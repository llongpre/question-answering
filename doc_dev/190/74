   It was such a slow news day when he began as the
new president of Cable News Network, Tom Johnson recalls, that
``CNN was televising stories on mules diving into pools of water.''
   That was on Aug. 1, when he reported for duty with a number of
projects in mind. They included an effort to get Bill Moyers, his
White House boss during the Johnson Administration, to move from
PBS to CNN.
   But all that was put on hold the next day, when Iraq invaded
Kuwait. CNN and its rivals scrambled to cover the Persian Gulf
crisis and a possible war.
   A month later, CNN had its own crisis.
   ``We found ourselves no longer simply reporting on budget
deficits, but ... experiencing our own as a result of the massive
expenses of the Gulf crisis coverage and a softening advertising
market,'' Johnson said.
   And last month, there was another crisis, which began when a
federal judge barred CNN from airing tapes of jailhouse phone calls
by ousted Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
   Though the Supreme Court refused to hear CNN's argument that the
ban was unconstitutional prior restraint of the press, the judge in
the Noriega case later lifted it.
   ``It was a very busy four months,'' said Johnson, understating
the case.
   It surprised many in the industry when CNN's owner, Ted Turner,
went outside both the company and broadcast news to hire Johnson,
who then was publisher of the Los Angeles Times.
   ``We really wanted someone that had a lot of management
experience and had a good reputation as a strong people-person, as
well as strong journalistic credentials,'' Turner said.
   It was the second time in two years a major network had chosen a
newspaperman to run its news division. In 1988, NBC hired Michael
G. Gartner, then head of the Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.
   How great a transition is it from print to television news?
   ``It totally depends on the person,'' Gartner said. ``I don't
think you can generalize.''
   ``I don't think there's a great deal of difference in terms of
the principles,'' said Moyers, who before working at PBS and CBS
was publisher of Newsday on Long Island, N.Y.
   ``The principles are: Remember you're in the news business, find
the best people and give them a chance to do their work in an
atmosphere of freedom and creativity.''
   But Moyers said his longtime friend ``is really on the front
line now in a way that he wasn't at the Times, because as
publisher, he had a phalanx of people reporting to him. While
that's also true at CNN, he's making, on a daily basis, the kind of
decisions an editor makes every day. ... I think he's now in a job
more like Patton than Eisenhower.''
   ``The intensity of the place surprised me. Perhaps it shouldn't
have,'' said Johnson, who for three years was a top executive in
Lyndon Johnson's Texas broadcast operations but who has spent the
bulk of his career in print journalism.
   CNN was ridiculed by rivals as ``Chicken Noodle News'' when it
began in 1980. No more. It now is an influential, worldwide TV news
organization seen in 100 countries, with President Bush and Iraq's
Saddam Hussein among its better-known viewers.
   Plugged into 57 million U.S. homes and offices by cable, it also
has 227 TV station affiliates who can excerpt CNN stories for their
newscasts.
   Significantly, 130 of the stations also are affiliates of ABC,
CBS or NBC, whose news divisions are caught in the same advertising
and money crunch as CNN and have pink-slipped some employees to cut
costs.
   But there have been no layoffs among CNN's worldwide workforce
of 1,700, Johnson said, and none are planned.
   Despite the cost crunch, CNN ``is very healthy economically,''
he said, although ``the slowdown in advertising and costs of the
Gulf coverage required that I implement a number of holddowns.''
   That included the axing of ``East Meets West,'' a weekly
half-hour series on Asian lifestyles and business customs.
   If the nation's economic slump and the Gulf crisis continues,
``then I probably would need to find other ways to contain costs
while doing that which is essential for CNN to do,'' Johnson said.
   But ``we will provide comprehensive news throughout all of this.
... This is a period of time when I think our audience is more
interested in the news than ever before.''
   The financial crunch has prompted Johnson to temporarily shelve
what he calls ``several initatives,'' or ideas for new programs.
   One is a series similar to ABC's ``Nightline.'' There has been
speculation within CNN that it might evolve from CNN's nightly
``Crisis in the Gulf'' broadcasts, just as ``Nightline'' evolved
from ABC's late-night reports on the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.
   Johnson also would like to start a series about the print and
electronic media.
   And ``I would like to see us expand our international bureaus in
Africa, Central and South America, and Asia, three places where I
feel more coverage would be useful,'' he said. CNN now has 14
foreign bureaus.
   Johnson said he still hopes to land Moyers, whom he first met in
1965 while on a White House Fellowship. He initially served as an
aide to Moyers, then press secretary for President Johnson.
   Moyers said there have no serious discussions about a move to
CNN.
   Shortly before taking charge at the network, Johnson ``just said
if I ever get ready to come back to the news business, let him
know,'' Moyers said. ``I said to Tom that I have commitments here
at PBS that I intend to fulfill ... but someday he and I can sit
down and talk.''
   ``I would like to see Bill do at CNN what he does at public
television,'' Johnson said, referring to Moyers' acclaimed specials
on various topics. ``I also suggested to him a concept I described
as `Around the World With CNN.' ''
   In that, Moyers would interview major players in world events,
among them Saddam Hussein, Soviet president Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and President Bush.
   ``I would love to see him as part of the future of this
network,'' Johnson said. ``But he is currently committed to his PBS
lineup and there are no immediate plans for him to move over -
although I'd be willing to re-open that any day.''
