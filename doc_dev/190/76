<LEADPARA>  A federal judge said there were some problems with government taping of Manuel
Noriega's prison phone calls, but none serious enough to throw out the drug
case against the deposed Panamanian leader.;    Noriega's lawyers, meanwhile,
accepted a new plan for getting paid, and the case appeared headed for trial
June 24.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  JUDGE REFUSES TO FREE NORIEGA OVER RECORDINGS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Monday rejected a defense motion to
dismiss the charges against Noriega because of the government tapes. They were
leaked to CNN and became the focus of constitutional debate over the right to
free speech against a defendant's right to a fair trial.;    Hoeveler said
Noriega clearly knew in some conversations that the government was
eavesdropping, and he shouldn't have been surprised his calls were taped.;   
"The general is a man of intelligence, and in another sense of the word, is a
former intelligence officer with his government," the judge said. "He is more
aware of this than most of us are.";    "While there were some irregularities,
I'm going to follow the law which says that dismissal is too great a
sanction," Hoeveler said. "I don't think the defendant has been hurt to the
extent that he has been denied a fair trial.";    Hoeveler indicated he was
unhappy with the prosecutor's admitted effort to hide subpoenas for the tapes
from the defense, and said the U.S. attorney's office should change the
practice. He previously banned the government from taping more of Noriega's
phone calls without his permission.;    The judge also said he would review
the matter later if the defense could show him evidence that the recordings
damaged their case. Defense lawyers say the calls compromised their case by
revealing their worries about certain witnesses.;    CNN still faces a
possible criminal contempt hearing for broadcasting one of the tapes after
Hoeveler ordered it not to. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that CNN had to obey
Hoeveler's order.;    Also, former Noriega intelligence chief Jose Blandon,
given the tapes by the Drug Enforcement Administration to review for evidence,
is under criminal investigation for allegedly leaking them to CNN.;    On
another front Monday, Noriega's two principal defense attorneys formally
agreed to stay on the case after Austria agreed to unfreeze $1.6 million in a
bank account in Noriega's wife's name. The defense says that money already is
committed for past expenses.;    In addition, the government will designate
Frank Rubino and Jon May as court-appointed counsel at $75 an hour both in and
out of court, along with unspecified expenses for experts and investigators.
Usual federal rates are $60 an hour in court and $40 an hour for preparatory
work. Rubino had sought $350 an hour.;    Noriega is being held at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center outside Miami on charges of accepting $4.6
million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to protect U.S.-bound
cocaine shipments. He was captured shortly after the December 1989 U.S.
invasion of Panama.  </TEXT>
