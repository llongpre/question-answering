American Airline flights will feature taped CNN newscasts without pictures of 
plane crashes after CBS balked at the airline's request that it cut such 
stories from its in-flight programs. 
</P>
<P>
American did not renew its six-year contract with the "CBS Morning News," and 
the last program will be shown on the airline before Feb. 28, said David 
Berman, a vice president at CBS Broadcast International. 
</P>
<P>
Under American's guidelines, he said, CBS has pulled entire news programs with 
reports of airline crashes or "virtually anything detrimental to the airlines." 
</P>
<P>
But CBS refused American's request to delete adverse airline news "and deliver 
the remainder of the show," he said. 
</P>
<P>
American's rationale may be to avoid alarming passengers, but "it's like 
passing out newspapers with holes cut in them," Berman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
American's decision to drop CBS was financial and wasn't based on an editorial 
dispute, said Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline. "We didn't feel we 
were earning enough profit from our agreement with CBS," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the new CNN arrangement, in which video portraying airline crashes 
will be deleted, was worked out after American's surveys showed that its 
passengers complained that pictures of airline crash scenes disturbed them. 
</P>
<P>
American's new in-flight agreement for Cable News Network newscasts is with 
Turner Home Entertainment, a division of Ted Turner's Atlanta-based cable 
empire that merchandises CNN productions. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 10 other airlines using CNN has asked for edited versions of the 
news, which is recorded from live feeds, a CNN spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
CNN is the only network with the capability to send live news feeds around the 
world to be taped for international flights.
