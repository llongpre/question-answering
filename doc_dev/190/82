<LEADPARA>  SATELLITE dish owners are getting a view of the Persian Gulf war that even CNN
can't provide.;    Television reporters in the Middle East send their tapes
home by satellite, and dish owners can pick up these unedited videos at the
same time news networks are receiving them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Satellite TV has revolutionized the immediacy of the war," said Linda
Ramsay, managing editor of Satellite Orbit magazine in Virginia. "With a
satellite system, you can pick up information about the war before it's
transmitted on the networks.";    Some of the fare is trivial. "You can see
Connie Chung fixing her hair before she gets on the air," said Ramsay.;    But
much of the footage is grim testament to the trials of soldiers fighting this
desert war.;    Dish viewers can watch battle scenes shortly after they
happen, said Jay Hylsky, satellite information editor at Satellite Orbit
magazine.;    Though dramatic and informative, many of the scenes will never
be broadcast by CBS, NBC, PBS or CNN, said Hylsky.;    California ranks first
nationally in satellite dishes with 325,000; then come Texas, 265,800,
Florida, 162,500 and North Carolina (139,500), according to the Satellite
Broadcasting and Communications Association.;    "You get to choose what you
see without having a cable company picking what you can see," Hylsky said.;   
Hylsky said he deduced that war was afoot 20 minutes before it was officially
announced from watching news feeds from reporters in Saudi Arabia.;    "I was
monitoring several satellite TV channels -- pool feeds -- and you could see
the tension and you could hear the jets roaring off and the high level of
activity," Hylsky said.;    He said he saw a pool feed produced by U.S.
military reporters out in the field showing the attack on Khafji. "I was able
to see it off the satellite hours before it appeared on the network news," he
said.;    "Also, I was seeing it uncut, except for military censors," Hylsky
said. "Military reporters go into battle with cameras, and you're not just
seeing 30 seconds or highlights. You're seeing what is going on.;    "You can
watch these pool feeds 24 hours a day, and you get a lot better idea of how
our troops are doing over there and how they're coping with the desert,"
Hylsky said.;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTEDHylsky suggests watching these satellite
news feeds: Galaxy 6 (G6), channel 3 (Saudi pool feed; CNN, ABC and military
reports). Satcom F2, channel 3 (Saudi pool feed used by ABC, Worldwide TV
News). Telstar 301, channels 6, 10 (ABC); Channels 16, 19 (international news
services). Weststar 4 (W4), channel 12 (BBC, Bisnews). Telstar 302, channel
18-20 (CBS). Satcom K2, all odd channels are NBC. SBS 3, channel 20 (Saudi
pool feed; military, NBC). Telstar 302, channel 18-20 (CBS). Satcom K2, all
odd channels are NBC. SBS 3, channel 20 (Saudi pool feed; military, NBC).  </TEXT>
