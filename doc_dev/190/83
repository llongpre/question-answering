   Cable News Network is reviving the movie theater
newsreel, but some film experts doubt the cinema CNN will be a hit
among audiences who already have expressed disdain for advertising
on the silver screen.
   CNN is hoping that reviving the newsreel, a relic from cinema's
pre-television golden age, will help promote the round-the-clock
cable TV network that is available to 54.4 million subscribers.
   The two-minute film segments, called ``CNN Reel News,'' make
their debut Friday in a New York theater chain. If successful during
a 90-day trial period, CNN officials say they will expand the
program nationwide.
   ``This is a way to inform and to, most importantly, entertain.
And it's another way of getting CNN's image out,'' said Rick
Salcedo, vice president of news promotion at Turner Broadcasting
System Inc., which owns CNN.
   Ironically, television hastened the demise of movie theater
newsreels. The most famous of them, Fox-Movietone News, ended
production in 1963, when TV's comprehensive news coverage made the
novelty of seeing faraway events on the big screen obsolete.
   ``Television was probably the major factor'' in the demise of
newsreels, said Glenn Smith, who maintains the Fox-Movietone
archives at the University of South Carolina.
   Smith said he is skeptical about whether today's audiences want
or need to see news stories at the movies. ``My personal opinion is,
you better have a very novel approach to it,'' he said.
   CNN's newsreels, which will be shown before feature films and
rotated biweekly, will tend to the lighter side of the news. Salcedo
said he figures audiences have plenty of opportunity to see the big
stories before they get to the theater.
   ``It's got to be something that doesn't have such a short shelf
life,'' Salcedo said. ``It's more of the lighter stuff, more of the
entertaining, informative type of information as opposed to the hard
news.''
   The newsreels include items plucked from CNN's regular
programming as well as stories that never made it to TV. A sample
newsreel shown to a reporter included 30-second segments on elephant
seals, frozen smoke experiments, an electronic movie ticket seller
and oatmeal wrestling.
   The opening and closing credits include vintage black and white
images, which turn into a color picture of a space shuttle. Those
segments, which were still in production Thursday, will prominently
feature the CNN logo, according to Salcedo.
   It borders on advertising, and that could mean trouble. Saying
moviegoers don't like commercials, Walt Disney Studios and Warner
Bros. have banned on-screen ads at theaters showing their films.
   Salcedo said the newsreels would not be shown before Disney
films, but he was unsure about Warner Bros.
   Jack Boozer, an assistant professor of communications at Georgia
State University who specializes in movies, said it's difficult to
predict how audiences will react to the CNN newsreels.
   ``I don't think it will be resented as much as the advertising,
which is just blatant,'' Boozer said. ``I don't think it's a viable
idea unless it is `large picture' type of stories. Straight news,
talking heads won't work.''
   TBS has sunk about $100,000 into producing ``Reel News'' but is
not paying the 11-theater City Cinemas chain in New York to show it
during the trial period, Salcedo said.
   He said TBS will seek a corporate sponsor before going national
with the project.
   Although Turner owns a six-screen movie theater in Atlanta,
Salcedo said it was thought that a more objective appraisal of the
newsreels could be obtained in New York.
   ``You get a much more critical audience up there,'' he said. ``If
they start throwing things at the screen, it might tell us
something.''
