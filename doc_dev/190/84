   U.S. bombers destroyed the
young girl's home, and she avidly practiced target shooting in case
Americans, those ``monster-like people who would not even smile at
children,'' invaded her homeland of North Vietnam.
   Two decades later, Nguyen Hanh appears regularly on America's
Cable News Network, hopes to hone her skills in the United States _
and says she bears no hard feelings about the past.
   The 29-year-old newswoman is one of four employees of state-run
Vietnam Television who contribute almost every week to CNN's
``World Report,'' which presents reports from local correspondents
around the world without comment or editing.
   An agreement _ worked out in the face of U.S. government
opposition _ provides Vietnam Television with the CNN service while
the American cable network gets reporting from Mrs. Hanh and her
colleagues.
   CNN charges a token 50 Vietnamese dong a year, less than a U.S.
penny, for its service, and has thrown in free a satellite
receiving dish to be installed in Hanoi by mid-June.
   The program's stress on foreign media doing things its own way
can make it difficult to evaluate reporting content, said Stuart
Loory, a CNN vice president who oversees ``World Report.'' But he
said the Vietnamese input has improved technically ``1,000
percent.'' He also praised Mrs. Hanh.
   ``She is one of those who has been working very hard to
interpret her country to the rest of the world,'' Loory said in a
telephone interview from CNN headquarters in Atlanta.
   Mrs. Hanh's coverage for CNN _ normally two- or three-minute
spots _ has included private enterprise in Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam's attempts to attract foreign tourists, and a recent return
by Hanoi of remains of Americans missing in action.
   She said her early connections with America were not happy ones.
   On Dec. 26, 1972, her home in Hanoi was destroyed when former
President Nixon ordered the ``Christmas bombings'' to pressure
Vietnam into agreeing to peace terms.
   ``When I was small, I thought Americans were terrible,
monster-like people who would not even smile at children,'' she
said. She remembered scoring 29 out of 30 points in target practice
designed to prepare everyone for possible American attacks.
   Mrs. Hanh, whose husband is a sports reporter for Vietnam
Television, graduated in English from Hanoi's Foreign Language
Teachers Training College and later took courses in journalism. She
hopes she can attend a training course in Atlanta that CNN offers
some ``World Report'' contributors.
   ``Sometimes CNN suggests stories, but it's not always possible
to do them,'' Mrs. Hanh said. ``We try to think up things that will
make foreigners understand Vietnam better.''
   Mrs. Hanh said Vietnam Television wanted to put the country's
best face forward to international audiences, and suggested more
leeway was allowed in critical and investigative reporting for
domestic consumption.
   Unfettering communist Vietnam's guarded media was one argument
used by the Turner Broadcasting System, which owns CNN, in its
battle with the U.S. government, which initially said the network's
dealings violated a tough U.S. trade embargo with Vietnam.
   But the U.S. Congress in 1988 amended the embargo to exempt
information materials and when the government finally backed down
last January, an administration official noted ``the importance of
having U.S. news programs in Vietnam.''
   It still is unclear, however, what, if any, censorship Vietnam
Television will exercise in disseminating the CNN service within
the country.
   After some reportedly difficult dealings with the Vietnamese,
CNN owner Ted Turner met with Vietnam Television executives two
years ago and agreement was quickly reached. CNN currently has
similar cooperative arrangements with 150 organizations in 120
countries or other entities.
   ``Ted Turner believes strongly in the free flow of information
and sees this exchange as helping to bring Vietnam back into the
world of nations,'' Loory said.

   WOMEN AND BROADCASTING: The 39th annual convention of American
Women in Radio and Television starts today in Washington. Talk show
host Joan Rivers may get the most notice in a Friday panel on the
First Amendment and indecency. But another Friday session, on the
power of news media in global change, will have the widest range of
panel members. They're broadcasters from the Philippines,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, West Germany and the Soviet
Union.
