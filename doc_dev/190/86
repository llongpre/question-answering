   Among the less-noticed features of the Moscow summit are the Spanish-language broadcasts from there to the U.S. by Cable News Network. 

   The broadcasts to a group of Spanish-language stations will continue after the Summit. 
They represent the first salvo in the Atlanta-based network's effort to seize a piece of the fast-growing Hispanic television market. 

   The entry of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s CNN into Spanish-language television is the first by a major English-language television programmer. 
It is yet another sign of the coming of age of the U.S. Hispanic market. 

   For CNN, which already broadcasts to 58 countries in English, the new Spanish broadcasts are also a logical step toward penetrating Latin American markets. 
"Three hundred million Spanish-speaking viewers are, for Ted Turner, a finger-licking, lip-smacking good audience," says CNN Vice President Paul Amos. 
Already the company has agreements with 11 Latin American countries to carry the news program, Mr. Amos says. 

   Cable News's half-hour newscast, called Noticiero Telemundo/CNN, will continue to be seen twice daily over the 18 Spanish-language stations owned by or affiliated with Telemundo Group Inc., a New York-based unit of Reliance Group Holdings Inc. 
It replaced a news broadcast produced by Hispanic-American Broadcasting Corp. for which Telemundo paid between $3.5 million and $4 million last year, according to Telemundo's president and chief executive officer, Henry Silverman. 

   "It's not an economic decision, it's one taken to improve the news," says Mr. Silverman. 
According to the agreement, CNN will produce the news while Telemundo will sell advertising. 
The two companies will split the advertising revenue. 

   Hispanic broadcasting is a fast-growing albeit small media market in the U.S. Last year, advertisers spent about $222 million on Spanish-language television, a 21% increase from $184 million in 1986, according to Hispanic Business magazine. 

   CNN's entry into the Hispanic market poses a challenge for Univision Holdings Inc., the Spanish-language broadcasting system owned by Hallmark Cards Inc. and a unit of First Chicago Corp., which has dominated the market for the past seven years and also broadcasts to about 10 Latin American countries. 
"It's going to be competition but we are ready for it," says Guillermo Martinez, Univision's news director. 

   Mr. Martinez says that notwithstanding CNN's recognized news gathering experience and its world-wide resources, the Atlanta-based television programmer has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to Spanish-language journalism. 
"Their strength is their video, their weakness is that it's a translation of a newscast made for Americans," says Mr. Martinez. 

   Mr. Amos grudgingly concedes part of that point -- but only for the moment. 
"We are at a slight disadvantage moving into an area that is culturally unfamiliar to us," he says. 
But, he adds, CNN has the news-gathering resources and commitment to Spanish-language broadcasting to win that audience. 
"This is just the beginning," Mr. Amos vows.
