<HEAD>Iraqi Videotape Raises Journalistic Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable News Network's decision to air Iraqi
satellite transmissions live, including one segment of tape that
showed a meeting between Saddam Hussein and Western hostages,
became the focus of journalistic debate.
   ``We would not do that under any circumstances,'' said Bob
McFarland, NBC deputy director of news. ``We made that decision the
first day they pumped it out. We decided it was pure propaganda.''
   None of the big three American networks _ NBC, ABC and CBS _
aired the Iraqi transmission live on Aug. 28, as CNN did. Instead,
they showed portions somewhat later.
   CNN said the meeting was important enough to show as quickly as
possible.
   ``We make these decisions on a case-by-case basis,'' said CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth, adding that CNN understood that Saddam
would be speaking with American hostages. ``There was no question
in our minds this would be newsworthy.''
   CNN explained to viewers that the broadcast was an Iraqi TV
feed. And afterward, CNN featured a debate over the wisdom of the
decisions it had made.
   It's a decision the other networks see differently.
   At NBC, ``we would not put Iraqi TV on the air without first
knowing what it was,'' McFarland said. ``We took every frame of it
into the house, looked at it, and then selected two or three
bites.''
   ``Wherever there is a hostage videotape, a captive videotape,
it's a decision we don't take lightly,'' said Sherrie Rollins, ABC
director of news information. The president of ABC News has to
approve the use of such video, she said.
   When Saddam appeared on television on Aug. 23 with Western
hostages, ABC joined the Iraqi satellite feed live for a few
moments after first viewing the transmission to gauge the content
of the material.
   ``We did air the material; we did feel it was newsworthy,'' Ms.
Rollins said.
   But when Saddam appeared with hostages again Aug. 28, ABC taped
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special
report by anchorman Peter Jennings, she said.
   After the first appearance on CNN, Pati Heath of Detroit, the
sister of an American hostage, called the Atlanta-based network to
say she had seen her brother on TV.
   CNN then put her on television, too.
   ``I'm just happy to be able to see my brother's face,'' she
said. ``I hope Hussein sees me talking right now.''
   The first U.S. interview with Saddam went to CBS news anchor Dan
Rather, on Aug. 29.
   CBS said the taped interview lasted 90 minutes and began shortly
after midnight in Baghdad. Rather was told there would be no
interview that day, but suddenly was summoned to the presidential
palace.
   There were no restrictions on what Rather could ask, said CBS
spokeswoman Donna Dees. The only conditions were that Iraqi TV
cameras be used and that it be a one-hour interview that would air
as recorded, she said.
   He agreed to let the interview run longer so it could be cut for
translation and minor editing, Dees said.

<HEAD>TV News Gets High Ratings During Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has created a thirst
for news that has lifted the ratings of everything from ``Face the
Nation'' to ``60 Minutes.''
   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was the most-watched show on prime-time
television for the second consecutive week, the A.C. Nielsen Co.
said Aug. 28. It was the program's first back-to-back No. 1
victories since 1983, when it was the top-rated show for the year.
   Viewership of six Sunday news and information programs _ ``Face
the Nation'' and ``Sunday Morning'' on CBS; ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' and ``Business World'' on ABC, and NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' and ``Sunday Today'' _ rose 27.7 percent since Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait, Nielsen reported.
   The most-watched nightly network news program belonged to ABC
and Peter Jennings, with a 10.4 average. CBS and Dan Rather were
second with 10.2 and NBC and Tom Brokaw was last with 8.9.

<HEAD>Wayne Newton's $5.2 Million Judgment Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $5.2 million libel damage award to singer
Wayne Newton from NBC was overturned Aug. 30 by a federal appeals
court. It said a broadcast suggesting mob ties in Newton's purchase
of a casino was not shown to be deliberately or recklessly false.
   A jury in Las Vegas found that the television network's October
1980 story about a federal investigation of the singer's
acquisition of the Aladdin Hotel and Casino had created a false
impression that criminal organizations had helped in the purchase
in exchange for a hidden share and that Newton had deceived Nevada
gaming officials.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 ruling, said
most of the factual statements in the broadcast were undisputed,
and that any false impressions had not been shown to be deliberate
or reckless.
   For example, the court said, citing evidence in the case, Newton
had contacted a purported organized crime figure, Guido Penosi,
about a problem; Penosi had arranged a solution, and Penosi and an
associate later discussed the possibility of profiting from
Newton's ownership of the Aladdin, a subject that came under
federal investigation.
   Newton testified that he asked Penosi to stop organized crime
threats against himself and his daughter. That subject was not
mentioned in the NBC story. The court said Newton had testified
falsely to the state Gaming Board about his relationship with
Penosi.
   The court did not say whether the story as a whole was false _
an issue it did not have to address. Instead, it found a lack of
evidence that the journalists had either deliberately lied or had
been reckless with the truth. That standard must be met by public
figures or public officials suing the news media for libel.
   The court said U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker, who reduced
the jury's $19.3 million libel award to $5.2 million, erroneously
allowed the damages to be based on a conclusion that NBC should
have realized its broadcast would give a false impression.
   What journalists should have realized or foreseen is irrelevant
in a libel suit by a public figure, which must be based on what a
journalist actually knew and intended, said the appellate decision
by Judge William Norris.
   He said Crocker also improperly ``substituted (his) own view as
to the supposed impression left by the broadcast for that of the
journalists who prepared the broadcast.''
   Newton had argued that the story's failure to mention the
threats against him as the reason he had contacted Penosi was a
deliberate omission of the truth. But Norris said the reporters had
reasons to doubt that threats had been made, noting that they had
gotten a denial from Newton's lawyer.
   Norris said the broadcast's statement that Newton had financial
problems at the time of the purchase was true. The broadcast had
some ambiguities about his financial arrangements and testimony,
which might have been cleared up by different wording, but
``editorial decisions about broadcasts are best left to editors,
not to judges and juries,'' Norris said.
