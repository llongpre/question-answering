<HEAD>CNN Scrambling Transmission to Central, South America</HEAD>

   Some satellite dish owners in Central and South
America no longer will get Cable News Network for free.
   Turner Broadcasting System said Dec. 20 that it will begin
scrambling its CNN feed south of the border next month.
   The company said it will make the switch when it begins beaming
the Turner Network Television movie channel to the region on a
scrambled signal. TBS said the dish owners were receiving the news
service illegally for two years.
   TBS feeds its 24-hour news channel to about 35,000 hotel rooms
and 250,000 homes in the region and sells its signal to about 35
broadcast clients, TV stations and networks.
   South American satellite dish owners who want to continue
receiving CNN would have to buy a receiver and decoder from an
equipment company, at a cost of about $1,300, and then enter a
contract with CNN to unscramble the feed.
   Although CNN does not now contract with individuals, spokeswoman
Kitsy Riggall said the company would ``certainly work with anybody
who wants to receive it.''
   TBS said it was concerned about ``weak copyright laws in the
region.'' It has been scrambling its signal in the United States
for five years.
   The company said it has no plans to scramble CNN's signal to the
rest of the world.

<HEAD>Man Who Appeared on `Geraldo' Sues Show for $28 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who appeared on ``Geraldo'' sued the host,
Geraldo Rivera, and a producer Dec. 20 for $28 million, claiming
they revealed his identity after promising not to do so.
   Carl J. Ober said in his lawsuit that he appeared on a segment
of the syndicated television show titled ``Telephone Terror,'' with
women who were victimized by telephone harassment.
   Ober, from Albany, appeared as an alleged telephone harasser
under a written and verbal agreement with Rivera that his identity
would not be revealed, the lawsuit said.
   On at least two occasions during the show, Rivera called him
``Carl'' and on at least two other occasions referred to him as
Carl Ober, the lawsuit said.
   The show aired Feb. 15, 1990.
   The lawsuit said Rivera disclosed Ober's occupation and place of
residence and identified a psychologist who is treating him.
   The lawsuit said that on at least four occasions, Ober's face
was shown with the words, ``Made obscene phone calls,'' and Rivera
called him a ``sick person'' who ``verbally raped'' women.
   The show had no immediate response to the lawsuit.
   Named as defendants in the lawsuit are: Rivera; a producer,
Marilyn Kaskel; and the Investigative News Group Inc., Rivera's
production company.
   The lawsuit said Ober suffered ``ridicule, embarrassment,
vexation, humiliation, mental and emotional distress.''

<HEAD>Home of `60 Minutes' Source Is Apparently Firebombed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mobile home of a man who appeared on ``60
Minutes'' to expose odometer tampering by used car dealers was
apparently firebombed while he was away, authorities said.
   The explosion and fire early Dec. 19 destroyed the home of
Charles Vance, a construction company owner and former used car
dealer who went to CBS along with a business partner with
allegations of fraud by Houston wholesalers.
   ``It's retaliation for the odometer segment,'' Vance said. ``I
would have done the same thing again. I believe it was something
that needed to be done.''
   Vance told authorities he had been getting death threats even
before the story aired Dec. 9. Shots were fired at the trailer Oct.
31, said ``60 Minutes'' spokesman Roy Brunett.
   Vance said he has been moving his family from the home
frequently to make it appear people were living there. He said the
family stayed there the night of Dec. 17 but stayed elsewhere the
next night.
   ``We're happy that he's safe and we're thankful that no one was
hurt,'' Brunett said.

<HEAD>NBC Insiders Speculate Couric Will Replace Norville</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RADNOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than a year after Deborah Norville
succeeded Jane Pauley on NBC's ``Today'' show, network sources are
speculating that national correspondent Katie Couric will replace
her, a published report said.
   Don Browne, executive vice president of NBC News, denied the
rumors, saying it's too soon after Ms. Norville's arrival to change
the show's co-hosts.
   Ms. Couric is scheduled to substitute for Ms. Norville when she
goes on maternity leave in the spring.
   ``She's no substitute - she's the successor,'' an unidentified
source told TV Guide in its Dec. 29 issue. ``Deborah's a bright
woman, but she doesn't come across that way on camera. She comes
across as plastic. Katie's real.''
   Ms. Couric joined NBC in 1989 as deputy Pentagon correspondent.
She has filled in several times as weekend anchor of ``NBC Nightly
News'' and is scheduled to substitute for ``Nightly News''
anchorman Tom Brokaw on New Year's Eve.

<HEAD>Public Television News Magazine Renewed After Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public television station KCET reversed
itself Dec. 18 and decided to renew ``South Africa Now'' after a
conservative media group that fought the show filed papers
challenging the station's license.
   The station's decision came one day after the Committee on Media
Integrity asked the Federal Communications Commission to deny
renewal of KCET's license and a request for a new transmitter.
   Group spokesman David Horowitz offered to withdraw the challenge
if the station established an elected board of directors and hired
an ombudsman.
   KCET President William Kobin called the demands preposterous and
part of a longstanding effort to control the station.
   ``South Africa Now,'' which covers issues in that country from a
black perspective, was canceled in October after KCET judged it did
not meet journalistic standards for objectivity.
   The program is scheduled for Sundays at 9 a.m. The station said
it will run with a disclaimer identifying it as a ``point of view''
series.

<HEAD>British Government Clears Satellite TV Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Dec. 18 cleared a merger between
Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting.
Opposition parties immediately criticized the decision.
   ``It is detrimental to the public interest that Sky should be
allowed to establish a satellite television monopoly without
penalty,'' said Labor lawmaker Robin Corbett, the party's spokesman
on broadcasting matters.
   Sky Television, which had four channels, and BSB, which had
five, announced the merger in early November to stem mounting
losses from both operations.
   The renamed, five-channel British Sky Broadcasting, is 50
percent owned by Murdoch's News International and 50 percent by
BSB's existing shareholders, the publishers Pearson PLC and Reed
International PLC, the entertainment company Granada Group PLC, and
the French conglomerate Chargeurs SA.
   Until the launch of Sky in 1989, Britain had four land-based
channels. BSB began operating earlier this year.
