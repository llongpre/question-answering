   Cable News Network pulled the plug on
unchallenged commentaries, including the wry observations of Linda
Ellerbee, in an unexplained ``management decision,'' CNN spokesmen
said Thursday.
   Commentaries on CNN's discussion programs, and the opposing
views expressed on them, will continue on the 24-hour schedule.
Those programs are ``Crossfire,'' ``Evans &amp; Novak'' and the
``Capitol Gang.''
   CNN gave no reason for the end Monday to free-standing
commentaries, including those of Ellerbee, Robert Novak, Marty
Schramm, weatherman Flip Spiceland and sportscaster Jim Huber.
   Steve Haworth, a spokesman at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, said
``it was just a management decision.''
   All of the commentators but Ellerbee do other work for CNN.
   ``We hope to keep her on the air in some capacity,'' said CNN
spokesman John Bianchi in New York.
   A recent editorial in The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash.,
criticized a Spiceland commentary in which the weatherman said
women's logic ``is one of those contradictory terms like military
intelligence.''
   Haworth would not comment on reports that Ted Turner, who owns
CNN parent Turner Broadcasting System, ordered the end of
unchallenged commentaries after the editorial.
   Of the major network evening newscasts, only the ``NBC Nightly
News'' still regularly airs commentary, by John Chancellor. ABC's
``World News Tonight'' does it on an irregular basis with George
Will, said Elise Adde, an ABC News spokeswoman.
   CBS, whose ``CBS Evening News'' commentaries in recent years
were by Bill Moyers, discontinued them after Moyers quit in 1986
and returned to public TV. CBS, however, still has the only network
humorous commentator working in prime time television _ Andy Rooney
of ``60 Minutes.''
