<HEAD>Iraq Censors CNN Report, Rivals Say It Happens to Them, Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Iraqi officials censored a CNN report Sept. 12
in which a woman who had been trapped in Kuwait said Iraqis killed
people simply because they had pictures of the country's deposed
emir.
   As in previous cases, the report was censored by fast-forwarding
past the woman's comments during the report's satellite
transmission from Baghdad, making her words unintelligible, a Cable
News Network spokesman said.
   However, correspondent Tom Mintier, who filed CNN's report from
Baghdad, called a colleague in Jordan with his recollection of the
woman's comments, which was relayed to CNN in Atlanta for a later
broadcast, CNN said.
   The woman, whose name was not released, was on a London-bound
charter flight filled with foreigners who had been trapped in
Kuwait since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of that country, CNN spokesman
Steve Haworth said.
   In an interview during the flight's stopover in Baghdad, she
said that ``they (Iraqis) are killing them for having pictures of
the emir and paper flags the kids have for school. They are killing
them for this. It's getting really bad.''
   The woman apparently referred to Kuwaitis and paper Kuwaiti
flags.
   Iraqi censorship of U.S. network reports, occurring even as
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein continues to try to portray himself
positively on television, is neither unusual nor yet excessive,
network officials say.
   ``It's a common experience among all the networks,'' said Ed
Turner, CNN's executive vice president for news gathering.
   Turner said another network's shot of baking pita bread was
censored and yet another ``had a sound bite from Saddam himself,
and that was fast-forwarded.''
   CNN has been censored about six times, which is ``not so many as
to be onerous, but it is annoying,'' Turner said.
   Each time, including Sept. 12, CNN showed the full report as it
was received from Baghdad, but noted which parts were censored.
   David Miller, foreign editor for NBC News, said three taped NBC
reports, all about hostages, had been censored during satellite
transmission. The correspondent's words were not altered, but the
picture was blurred, he said.
   Each time, the ``NBC Nightly News,'' aired the full report.
   Iraqi censors seem most sensitive to reports on hostages, said
CBS foreign editor Al Ortiz. But the censorship has not been so
severe ``that we haven't been able to . . . still manage to get the
story reported,'' he said.
   Miller said there were no advance warnings from Iraqi officials
and they seemed to have no rules.
   ``I don't think they have guidelines . . . there's no set of
rules the way the U.S. military (in Saudi Arabia) does it.''

<HEAD>NAB To Send Radios to Persian Gulf Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Broadcasters announced
a campaign to send radio receivers and batteries to American
service men and women serving in the Persian Gulf.
   The campaign, called ``AIR-LIFT,'' will purchase radios and
batteries from industry fund-raising efforts and distribute them to
U.S. troops through the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service,
the association said Sept 12.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting Co.'s Group W Radio division will lead
the fund-raising campaign and purchase the products, the industry
group said.
   ``Our goal is to get as many radios to as many troops as we
possibly can, with a target of 25,000 receivers with batteries,''
said Lynn Christian, a senior vice president for the association.
``We think radio can play a very important role keeping our
fighting people in touch with the world.''

<HEAD>Limited Televising of Federal Court Proceedings Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Americans, accustomed to watching presidents
and members of Congress on television, will get their first
televised look at federal judges at work next year.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, which sets policy for the federal
courts, approved a limited plan Sept. 12 that will permit TV
cameras to record civil trials in a handful of federal courtrooms.
   The three-year experiment will begin in July, limited to two
federal appeals courts and six trial courts. Judges who volunteer
their courtrooms for the plan will have almost total control over
what the public sees.
   Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., who has been urging approval
of the experiment, hailed the move as a step toward promoting
public understanding of the court system.
   ``The time for federal courts to permit TV news coverage in
courtrooms has come,'' said Kastenmeier, chairman of a House
subcommittee on courts. ``Technology that permits us access to
world events also compels us to use that access to make our own
government available to our citizens.''
   Kastenmeier said televised congressional proceedings, which
began in the House in 1979 and in the Senate in 1986, have been
beneficial to the public.
   C-Span, the cable network that telecasts public affairs
programs, also welcomed the experiment.
   Forty-five states have approved the use of television cameras in
their courts, and supporters say there have been no adverse
results.
   The action does not mean federal criminal trials will be
televised. The Judicial Conference left intact a rule banning
cameras in criminal cases.
   Nor will Supreme Court proceedings be televised anytime soon.
The Judicial Conference has no control over the high court, and
most justices are believed to oppose cameras there.
