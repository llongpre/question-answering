GOODALL IN PERSPECTIVE

Reading the article on Jane Goodall left me with a strange feeling 
("Spellbinding Advocate for Animals," by Beth Ann Krier, April 27). 
</P>
<P>
Most people know who Jane Goodall is, more people than saw "Gorillas in the 
Mist" I would venture to guess. National Geographic has always printed articles 
about her work and its importance to our understanding of human behavior in 
order that we perhaps could improve the quality of life on this planet. The 
writer of this article is using phrases and descriptions that are really in my 
opinion not at all appropriate to an article on Jane Goodall. "Seduces her 
audiences" . . . "her fine boned hand" . . . "slim and elegant with her gray 
hair pulled back in a simple ponytail . . . " these are fashion-like, artsy and 
shallow descriptions, not needed since there is a photograph on the front page. 
It really doesn't work for me in an article that should be informed and 
scientific.
