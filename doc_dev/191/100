   A Harvard University researcher gave poor chances of success for a popular new experimental approach to AIDS therapy. 

   William Haseltine of Harvard and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said that the body's paradoxical response to the acquired immune deficiency virus "raises serious problems for the use of CD4 as a therapy." 

   CD4, which is expected to enter human clinical tests later this year, is currently being developed by at least half a dozen commercial and academic research groups in the U.S. and in Europe, including Genentech Inc., a biotechnology company in South San Francisco, and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 
CD4 is the protein on the surface of human white blood lymphocytes, to which the AIDS virus binds during infection. 

   Current research into its use is based on the theory that doctors could flood the body with synthetic copies of CD4, made by gene-splicing, deploying them like tiny decoys to lure the virus away from the white blood cells it normally infects. 

   However, Dr. Haseltine in a keynote address at the conference yesterday, asserted that in a paradoxical reaction to the AIDS virus, about 10% of patients develop antibodies against the CD4 protein on their own cells. 
This is known as an "auto-immune reaction" because the body is attacking itself. 

   "If people are given CD4, they will make antibodies to it as they do to insulin," Dr. Haseltine said, adding that this could be dangerous. 

   "There's no scientific evidence" supporting Dr. Haseltine's assertion, said Daniel J. Capon, a Genentech scientist working on CD4. 
"It's premature to speculate." 

   Added Stephen Sherwin, another Genentech scientist, "CD4 is clearly going to have to be tested in patients. 
We need clinical trials." 
Some scientists said it would be bad if support for a drug trial dried up because of criticism by Dr. Haseltine. 

   In the realm of animal experiments, there was good news and bad news from researchers at the conference. 

   The bad news came from Jorg Eichberg of the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio, Texas. 
Dr. Eichberg said efforts to immunize chimpanzees against the AIDS virus with HIV immune globulin failed to protect the animals against a later challenge with live virus. 
The immune globulin was made from pooled serum of donors who had been exposed to the AIDS virus and made a range of antibodies to it. 

   All the animals in the test became infected despite the treatment, suggesting that merely giving antibodies won't be a useful tool of prevention. 
The project was a joint effort by Dr. Eichberg and collaborators at the Pasteur Institute in Paris; the Lindley F. Kimball Research Institute of the New York Blood Center in New York; and the Central Laboratories of the Netherlands Red Cross in Amsterdam. 

   But there was also reported progress by the National Institutes of Health in its effort to create a gene-spliced mouse that would carry AIDS virus genes and mimic a state of infection, giving doctors a new model for testing therapies. 

   The experiment, by Malcolm A. Martin and colleagues at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a unit of NIH, raised an outcry by environmentalists who feared the hybrid rodent with AIDS in its genes might escape and breed with wild mice to create a new reservoir of the virus. 
Scientists created a jail-like habitat to contain the mice, complete with moats of chlorine bleach. 

   John M. Leonard of NIAID reported yesterday that the so-called transgenic mouse is expressing the virus, and has developed an immune dysfunction and swollen glands, much as humans do when infected by the AIDS virus. 

   This is good news due to the paucity of good animal models. 
Chimpanzees are costly and rare. 
They also react differently to the virus than humans, thus raising questions about the application of chimp studies to the human epidemic. 

   Dr. Leonard said the experiment shows that the transgenic mice "can be used to evaluate the effect of drugs" against the epidemic ailment.
