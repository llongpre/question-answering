   Try as she may, actress Beverly Garland seems
destined to be remembered for playing Fred MacMurray's wife in the
waning days of ``My Three Sons.''
   ``It really wasn't the highlight of my career. But I must say,
everybody seems to remember ``My Three Sons.'' No matter what I do,
no matter what I've done in my life, it's ``My Three Sons,''
Garland said Thursday on WNYW-TV's ``Good Day New York.''
   ``People say, `Did you ever do anything after ``My Three Sons?''
' They forget that I was Kate Jackson's mother for four years on
`Scarecrow and Mrs. King.' Nobody ever remembers that I was the
first policewoman on TV, before Angie Dickinson.''
   ``My Three Sons'' has been in reruns since it stopped production
some 20 years ago.

   ``Jake's Women,'' a new Neil Simon comedy
starring Peter Coyote and Stockard Channing, will close in San
Diego before it reaches New York, a spokesman said.
   It is the first time a Simon play scheduled for Broadway
production has closed out-of-town, said spokesman Bill Evans on
Thursday.
   ``The show may very well arrive to New York in another version,
but this production won't,'' Evans said.
   ``Jake's Women'' was to have opened at the Neil Simon Theater in
New York on April 30. It will close April 15 at San Diego's Old
Globe Theater.
   The comedy, which Simon has called semiautobiographical,
concerns a writer who is still coming to terms with the death of
his first wife while his second marriage falls apart.
   Simon, whose Broadway hits include ``Barefoot in the Park,''
``The Odd Couple'' and ``Biloxi Blues,'' has had his share of flops
on the Great White Way, including ``Fools,'' ``God's Favorite'' and
the revival of ``Little Me.''

   British ethnologist Jane Goodall says her
work to save chimpanzees from extinction makes it easier for her to
put up with the state of the world's environment.
   ``If I look at the whole world picture, overpopulation,
pollution, the destruction of forests and so on, it's hard to be
happy,'' Goodall said in a recent interview with The Oregonian.
   ``It's better to concentrate on the things I'm actually involved
with. That makes it a bit easier.''
   Goodall was in Oregon to give lectures on chimpanzees, which now
number between 100,000 to 200,000 in the wild.
   ``If we lost the chimps from the wild, that would also mean all
the forest would be gone,'' she said. ``And where would we all be?''
   Goodall, 56, went to Tanzania in 1960 to study with
paleontologist Louis Leakey, who sent her to study the behavior of
chimpanzees at Gombe, Tanzania. She has devouted nearly 30 years to
the study of the primate.

   Ask rock singer Laura Branigan about ``sex on
the beach'' and she'll tell you it's a new drink.
   At least that's what she says she would pass along to rock lyric
critics such as Tipper Gore.
   Branigan said Friday that she would tell the wife of U.S. Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., that ``sex on the beach'' is a drink if
she had to explain the lyrics of the title track from her new album
``Moonlight on Water.''
   The song includes these lyrics: ``Instead of dreamin' about all
the money we got much simpler things to do. Moonlight on water. Sex
on the beach.''
   She said the lyrics represent more than sex.
   ``Sex on the beach is really, I think, more than the actual
physical act. It's the feeling of being with someone you care about
or a friend, or just alone on the beach stripping off your clothes
at night and going skinny dipping and, you know, just living for
the moment.''

   Romanian defector Nadia Comaneci has given her
first gymnastics performance in six years.
   Comaneci performed Thursday night before a near-capacity crowd
at the 1,800-seat Ziegfeld Theater inside Bally's Reno
hotel-casino. It was her first U.S. exhibition in nine years and
her first public performance since 1984.
   Fighting off tears, Comaneci told the crowd, ``I'm glad to be in
my new homeland. This is very emotional for me. ... I love America.
I love you all.''
   A cast of 16 younger gymnasts was in the performance, which was
taped by ABC Sports for broadcast April 21.
   The show's producer, Paul Ziert, said he's thinking of touring
with Comaneci.
   ``Nadia again is excited and motivated,'' Ziert said. ``She sees
that she can still do what she loves, that she can still be a part
of gymnastics.''
   Comaneci also was reunited with former coach Bela Karolyi, who
guided her to a series of perfect 10s and three gold medals in the
1976 Olympics in Montreal when she was 14.
   Karolyi defended the 28-year-old star from publicity over her
alleged tryst with a married man who helped her defect in December.
Karolyi, who defected 10 years ago, said she must have felt as he
did on his arrival in the United States.
   ``Ten years ago, I was standing in the streets of Los Angeles a
desperate man,'' he said. ``Ten years later, I believe Nadia was
just as desperate as me.''
