<LEADPARA>  NOSING around: Robert Redford starts a four-month "Sneakers" shoot on Oct. 14,
with filming to be done in L.A. and San Francisco. Included in the cast will
be Sidney Poitier, a wife for Poitier who's still to be cast, and someone to
play a bag lady in a scene with Redford.;   Jamie Lee Curtis turns director
for the segment of her ABC "Anything but Love" series that rolls Oct. 14.
It'll have Marty (Richard Lewis) talked into attending a wild-man weekend in
the woods to get in touch with the primitive man that lurks within his
neurotic urban exterior.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Delta Burke is keeping busy. Besides her "Love and Curses" TV movie that
recently aired, she's got "Dayo" upcoming. The NBC-TV movie that's slated to
go before the cameras Nov. 13 has her playing a housemate who becomes confused
and frustrated when she learns she is pregnant. From there on it gets weird --
as her life is thrown for a loop when her imaginary childhood playmate pays a
visit.; CROSS-ACTING: Kirstie Alley is doing her "Cheers" producers a favor
and making a guest appearance on their new "Flesh 'N Blood" series. Alley
tapes the segment next week and will play an old girlfriend of David Keith's.;
HELLO AGAIN: Howard Hesseman's Johnny Fever will become a recurring character
on the all-new syndicated "W.K.R.P. in Cincinnati" after all. When the show
first returned, Hesseman would only agree to appear in the two-part opener and
an occasional guest appearance. Now we're told, he's changed his mind in light
of the show's increasing popularity and has agreed to be a semi-regular.;
BEYOND HIS YEARS: "Wonder Years" star Fred Savage is set to narrate the voice
of a special guest character on the animated Saturday morning children's show
"Captain Planet and the Planeteers." In the Oct. 26 episode, 15-year-old
Savage provides the voice for Klek-Torr, a 70,000-year-old alien zoo keeper
who thinks humans are an endangered species whose habitat is about to be
destroyed.; INSIDE TRACK: Stevie Nicks will pay her personal tribute to
celebrated animal behaviorist Jane Goodall at The International Tribute to
Jane Goodall in Dallas Oct. 25. The former Fleetwood Mac member has written
"Jane's Song," a special tune for the event. Nicks says she was moved to write
a song in Goodall's honor after becoming aware of her research into the
cruelty experienced by chimpanzees in scientific experiments -- which include
shooting the primates with the AIDS virus. "Jane's Song" will appear on Nicks'
next solo album, with proceeds to go to the Jane Goodall Institute.  </TEXT>
