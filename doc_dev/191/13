<LEADPARA>  Naturalist Jane Goodall urged better treatment of chimpanzees in zoos and
laboratories during a stop at the Oakland zoo -- but there was somewhere she
would have rather been. "In a forest," Goodall said Monday during the
three-day ChimpanZoo conference, attended by almost 70 experts from U.S. zoos
trying to improve the lives of their chimps. "But after seeing how chimps are
treated, being killed, sold, studied in labs, that would be selfish of me,"
she said.  </LEADPARA>
