   In the tradition of Willie Nelson's Farm
Aid concerts, a Georgia businessman is lining up country western
entertainers to make a music video and record to benefit
financially pressed farmers.
   Chad Kramer of Atlanta said Friday he had been in touch with
Nelson's office because ``I felt a strong desire to keep things
going.''
   The project also is reminiscent of the ``We Are the World''
video and record in 1985, which raised money for African hunger
relief.
   Kramer said he has commitments from 20 recording artists who
plan to gather in Nashville June 6 to do a video of the song ``Lean
On Me,'' a 1972 hit by pop singer Bill Withers.
   Kramer said the participants include Tom Wopat, Tom T. Hall,
Eddy Raven, Jerry Jeff Walker, Johnny Rodriguez, Michael Johnson,
Skip Ewing, Larry Boone, Cristy Lane, Judy Rodman and Terri Gibbs.
Withers also will participate, Kramer said.
   Kramer projected proceeds at up to $4 million.

   Protests from anti-abortion activists and
the Roman Catholic Church forced the organizers of a medical
conference co-sponsored by a Catholic hospital to cancel an
appearance by Dr. Ruth Westheimer.
   The diminutive human sexuality expert was to discuss ``Sexuality
and the Medical Profession'' next week, but the address was
canceled after Saint Anthony Medical Center, a co-sponsor of the
event, received mail and phone calls protesting her appearance.
   The outspoken Westheimer, known as Dr. Ruth, is an author,
counselor, TV and radio talk show host, and a staunch advocate of
sex education.
   ``I think that she perhaps offended the sensibilities of members
of the Catholic Church with her stands on certain sexual topics,''
said Dr. Paul Maxwell, director of Continuing Medical Education at
Saint Anthony and head of a committee that chose speakers for the
conference. ``The problem seemed to be her public stance on
abortion, the use of condoms and other sensitive issues.''
   A spokesman for Westheimer said Friday that she believes people
who do not wish to hear her views should turn the dial.

   Jane Goodall, who comes out of Africa each year
to lecture and raise money for conservation research, says she is
concerned for the chimpanzees she has observed in Tanzania for 29
years.
   ``I feel a sense of growing urgency,'' Goodall said in an
address sponsored by the San Diego Zoological Society Thursday.
``The plight of the chimps in Africa is truly horrendous.''
   At the turn of the century, chimpanzees could be found in 25
African countries and numbered in the millions, she said. Today,
they are extinct in four of those countries and on the brink of
extinction in five others, said Goodall, 55.
   She said if chimpanzees are to survive in the wild there must be
fundamental changes, including an all-out effort to discourage
private ownership as pets as well as encouraging medical science to
seek alternative methods of research.

   Convicted murderer Jean Harris must turn over
$90,000 in profits from her autobiography to a board that dispenses
cash to crime victims.
   The state Crime Victims Board argued successfully that under
state law, profits from the book, ``Stranger in Two Worlds,''
should benefit survivors of Dr. Herman Tarnower, the man Mrs.
Harris killed.
   Mrs. Harris sought to donate the money to a fund for the
children of inmates at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility,
where she is serving a 15-year-to-life sentence for the March 1979
murder of the creator of the Scarsdale diet.
   The prison charity argued in a lawsuit that garnishing the money
would violate Mrs. Harris's constitutional rights. But state court
Justice Israel Rubin disagreed, ruling Thursday in the board's
favor.
   The money will be placed in escrow for up to five years. Under
the law, survivors of Tarnower must obtain a civil judgment in
order to obtain the money. If none comes forward, it will be
returned to Mrs. Harris.
   Mrs. Harris, 65, has written another book about her prison
experiences, ``They Always Call Us Ladies,'' which is not covered
by the state law because it does not discuss the murder of
Tarnower, her longtime lover.

   Fashion designer Oleg Cassini failed to
ride a winner in his first two races of the year at Freehold
Raceway, but, as he said, it could have been worse.
   In one race, Cassini's horse broke stride for a while and
another won easily. The second horse he jockeyed rallied from
fourth place to challenge the pacesetter at the half-mile pole, but
finished fifth.
   ``He could not catch up to the leaders, but I was very happy to
earn a check with him for fifth place,'' the 76-year-old Cassini
said Friday after his second race of the day. ``I am also happy
that I did not finish last in either race. Now that I am back in
action I hope to do better the next time I drive.''
