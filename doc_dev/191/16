<LEADPARA>  IT HAS to be one of the dumbest-sounding ideas of the new TV season: a sitcom
featuring actors   "playing" the emotions inside the leading character's
head.;   But "Herman's Head," which joins the Fox network's Sunday-night
comedy lineup this weekend, only sounds dumb. In practice, it actually works.
It has more than a few hearty laughs, which is all I ask of any sitcom.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Herman (William Ragsdale) is a would-be writer, working in the research
department of a big magazine. Basically, he's a nice young guy with all the
usual complications of the young -- career frustrations, romantic
uncertainties and what have you. From the outside, it looks as if he's
handling it all with a certain panache.;   But inside Herman's head, there's a
war going on: The "Animal" part of his nature (Ken Hudson Campbell) urges him
to jump the bones of all those sexy women in the office, while his sensitive
inner "Angel" (Molly Hagan) begs him to show more respect to women; the timid
"Wimp" (Rick Lawless) side of him asks him to remember what Mom might say; and
his intellectual "Genius" (Peter MacKenzie) component stuffily reminds him any
gross behavior is beneath him anyway.;   Naturally, with the odds stacked in
that manner, Herman tends to stay more congenial than courageous. Still, that
animal side does put up a pretty noisy argument from time to time.;   In
Sunday's premiere show, Herman's animal side acts up something awful when his
best pal's girlfriend (Corinne Bohrer) turns to him for solace, and all he can
think about is how to get her undressed while seeming thoughtful, considerate
and harmless.;   At first, it will seem awkward to keep shifting from Herman's
"real" world to the comfortable rec room in his noodle. But there's enough fun
in there to make it worth the necessary adjustments.;   All the "emotions" are
well cast, but the characters in Herman's daily life are even more promising.
Herman's pal Jay (Hank Azaria) is a very self-confident hustler. Office mate
Heddy (Jane Sibbett) is a deadly combination: gorgeous, but ruthless. The
boss, Mr. Bracken (Jason Bernard), acts like he always has a whip in his hand,
but he's reasonably fair-minded.;   My favorite is Louise (Yeardley Smith),
the eager office flunky, who's a real character. Smith is one of the season's
brightest newcomers. If her voice sounds familiar, that's probably because you
hear it every week on Fox's "The Simpsons," where she speaks for Bart's
sax-blowing sister, Lisa. She's even funnier speaking for herself.;   (Perky
Corinne Bohrer, so charming in Sunday's show, won't be a regular. She has left
to co-star with James Garner in his new NBC sitcom, "Man of the People.");  
"Herman's Head" could go stale if the writers don't keep the comedy frisky
enough, but I think the elements are there for a hit. It's certainly
innovative enough to shine brightly in an otherwise dull season.;   Amazing
chimps; Fans of TV nature shows should prepare themselves for a very moving
experience Sunday night, when cable's Discovery Channel airs its first
feature-length documentary of the fall season, "People of the Forest: The
Chimps of Gombe.";   Filmed in Tanzania over a 20-year period by acclaimed
wildlife cinematographer Hugo van Lawick, "People of the Forest" is the saga
of a single family of chimpanzees, surviving in an environment that is more
threatened each year.;   Incorporating the research of his famous former wife,
Jane Goodall, van Lawick has created a dramatic epic of the animal world that
can't fail to captivate all fans of this TV genre.;   We first meet the female
Fifi at age 25 in her habitat at the Gombe preserve, where she lives as the
senior female of the dominant family in the colony of 50 or so chimps. Then
van Lawick takes us back 20 years to her childhood.;   Fifi's story is both
humorous and tragic, but always heartwarming as we see her grow to maturity
among her kinfolk. Her life is filled with luminous characters, including her
patient 45-year-old mother, Flo; her ambitious and competitive brothers, Faben
and Figan; and her "spoiled" little brother, Flint.;   You'll see truly
amazing things, such as the cruel passage of a polio epidemic through the
colony and the heartbreaking decline of a chimp who actually dies from grief
over the loss of a loved one.;   The overwhelming message of van Lawick's
extraordinary film is that the chimps of Gombe truly are "people" with a
structured society and a full array of familiar emotions. It makes their grim
future as pawns of humankind even harder to take.;   Local guy goes Showtime;
Mark Schiff is pretty much a regular at San Jose comedy clubs. (He's due back
in November.) He's also one of the more promising of the younger stand-up
comics in America. So tonight he joins the flock of stand-ups given their own
comedy specials by the Showtime pay-TV network.;   In tonight's 10:30 outing,
"Mark Schiff: My Crummy Childhood," Schiff is found performing live before a
largely student crowd at New York University, the perfect audience for his
lively, youth-oriented act.;   Schiff's act is basically clean-cut and warmly
nostalgic, with lots of gags about shopping at supermarkets ("Paper or
plastic?"), living with pets ("I used to kiss my dog until one day I caught
him licking himself") and, of course, his family ("Grandmas have the biggest
underwear -- on the planet").;   This isn't a show filled with heavy yuks, but
Schiff is inventive and easy to take -- just the sort of young comic that you
can be sure will go on to bigger and better things real soon. See him now, and
brag later about how you caught him in his formative years.  </TEXT>
