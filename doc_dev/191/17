In "Peacemaking Among Primates," Frans de Waal calls attention to an important 
but recently overlooked perspective in ethology, the study of the evolution of 
behavior. A relatively new science, ethology incorporates theories of behavior 
that go back at least 200 years, when scientists first looked to the natural 
world for a blueprint of the social contract, the basis for human behavior. 
Since then, they have moved from the picture of man as a "noble savage," born 
into an Eden and then corrupted, to the post-Darwinian vision of man as another 
animal subject to fierce competition for limited resources in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
On a January day in 1880, a different view came to the attention of Peter 
Kropotkin, known historically as the ideologue of anarchism, when he heard 
about a lecture presented at the Russian Congress of Naturalists by a 
well-known zoologist, who suggested that besides the law of mutual struggle -- 
species locked in a gladiatorial battle for existence -- there was a 
corresponding and even more important law of mutual aid. Three years later, 
Kropotkin read the same suggestion in Darwin's "The Descent of Man" and set to 
work collecting data, which he published, in 1902, as "Mutual Aid," a chronicle 
of cooperative behavior in the progressive evolution of the species. 
</P>
<P>
Kropotkin reissued "Mutual Aid" in 1915 in order to set the record straight. He 
insisted that the war then destroying civilization as he knew it was not 
inevitable. People cooperate even under siege, he argued: Witness the peasant 
women who thrust bread and apples into the hands of German and Austrian 
prisoners as they trudged through the streets of Kiev. Mutual aid, he asserted, 
is a necessary correlative of competition among social animals, including human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
But this optimistic view of nature did not win much favor as the 20th Century 
continued with wars and genocide expanded to levels previously unimagined. 
Biologists and ethologists, along with psychologists and sociologists, sought 
the roots of this violence in the evolutionary past. 
</P>
<P>
The roots were not hard to find. Violence is dramatic and easy to document. 
Tracking hostile behaviors in other species fulfilled the expectations of those 
who read these acts as a genetic necessity, a selection of evolution. However, 
while aggression is a successful adaptation among other species, it becomes a 
fatal flaw in humans who still react instinctively, hair standing on end, 
adrenaline flowing, to hostile movements, responding with nuclear weapons 
instead of sharpened canines. 
</P>
<P>
The late Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian ethologist of enormous stature, observed 
that an animal must be aggressive to compete successfully, and he reasoned that 
aggression has biological roots. This concept, which he explored in "On 
Aggression," published in English in 1966, inspired a generation of scientists. 
Perhaps as an effort to universalize the atrocities of the war he had lived 
through in Germany, Lorenz defined aggression as the starting point of all 
social relationships. Aggression inspires hierarchy, community, and among 
non-human species controls the dispersion of resources. But among humans, he 
asserted, it is out of control. As a species we have run amok because we do not 
have the inhibition to control our aggressive instinct. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz's work was followed by a spate of books and articles testifying to the 
biological, hormonal and psychological basis of aggression in human beings. The 
consensus seemed to be that we come equipped with a runaway instinct, one that 
suited our ancestors on the savannah, but in the world of advanced weaponry 
seems to doom us to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Awash in this news about the aggressive nature of animals in general and 
primates in particular, ethologists such as Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey began 
to document intra-species killings, even cannibalism, among those apes we had 
all learned to love because of their gentle nature. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal rejects this pessimistic and one-sided picture of the human 
predicament. "Peacemaking Among Primates" can be seen as a delayed, and 
infinitely more sophisticated, sequel to Kropotkin's attempt to describe with 
scientific accuracy the centripetal forces that keep societies together as well 
as the centrifugal ones that drive them apart. It also is an elucidation and 
expansion of Lorenz's views, accepting the reality of aggression but positing 
it as only one side of the coin. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal is both a revisionist and an optimist. Indeed, he concedes that 
primates fight. But at least as often they avoid clashes that could lead to 
fights; and when they do fight, they make peace with their adversaries so that 
the community continues as before. He documents this assertion with detailed 
studies of five primate groups including chimpanzees, macaques and human 
beings, using data he has meticulously collected over more than a decade. He 
confirms in the idiom of a modern ethologist what Kropotkin could only surmise: 
that mutual aid has enabled primates to evolve complex and viable social 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal demonstrates that science can be like poetry: Once a truth is stated, 
our vision shifts and we cannot imagine how we did not see it before. We join 
De Waal in the public observation post at Arnhem Zoo in The Netherlands, above 
the largest colony of chimpanzees in captivity. De Waal knows each individual 
by name and personality (and has already written about them in an earlier book, 
"Chimpanzee Politics"). Familiar with their frequent fights, he realized in a 
moment of inspiration that their conflicts always ended in reconciliations that 
left most relationships repaired and normalized. Along with his colleagues, he 
had been blind for years to what had been happening before their eyes. Thus he 
began to study the nature of reconciliation, of peacemaking among these 
chimpanzees. 
</P>
<P>
From the chimps at Arnhem, he went on to study peacemaking among rhesus and 
stump-tailed macaques at the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center where 
he is now a research scientist; among bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees), in the 
unique group at the San Diego Zoo; and among human beings. He discovered 
similar patterns of peacemaking among the five groups of primates. He also 
discovered a blindness among other scientists to the study of peacemaking. He 
describes a world- renowned psychologist, a specialist in human aggression, who 
grew irritated at the suggestion that evolution has anything to do with 
explaining behavior, and had not even considered the possibility that conflicts 
are inevitable among people because aggression has a long evolutionary history, 
and that reconciliation is worth studying because it is logical to expect the 
co-evolution of powerful coping mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that psychologist will read his book. The evidence is overwhelming that 
we share with other primates the mechanisms for fighting, but also the need for 
friendship, support, body contact and even sexual activity as a social 
function, and to get these we, too, have evolved mechanisms for face-saving, 
for compromise, for consolation and for reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Until now -- and this is the heart of his message -- most scientists have 
believed that violence is more integral to human nature than peace. In reality, 
he demonstrates, we have highly developed strategies for consolation and 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal brings a new perspective to a discipline that has been dominated in the 
English-speaking world by self-consciously detached observers as well as by 
those who see animals as a gene's device to reproduce itself. De Waal also 
rejects the approach that science starts with a battery of hypotheses which are 
dispassionately tested. He points out that Darwin didn't set sail to test a 
theory. Rather, he returned with the ingredients to make one. 
</P>
<P>
Theory never takes precedence over his personal observations, one of which led 
him to reject the extrapolation of the famous crowded-rat experiment to the 
human condition. In this experiment, caged rats that were pushed closer and 
closer together eventually went mad and turned cannibal. But De Waal notes that 
vervet monkeys crowded together simply avoid eye contact and look at the sky 
and ground a lot. The same could be said for his countrymen who, while living 
in one of the most densely packed nations on earth, enjoy low crime rates and a 
high degree of personal tolerance. Primates are one thing, rats another. 
</P>
<P>
As a Dutchman, de Waal also is especially careful about English, the way a 
person must be whose native language is not the lingua franca of any major 
discipline. He distinguishes carefully between the words "aggression" and 
"violence," the latter being the most extreme but not the most common form of 
the former. He also distinguishes between "consolation," the act of support by 
a bystander to the victim of a hostile encounter, and "reconciliation," 
peacemaking between the actors in the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal's observations are wide-ranging, surprising and invariably provocative. 
With increased knowledge of primate behavior, he worries about the ways some 
zoos isolate these highly social creatures. From observations that male 
primates participate in acts of reconciliation more frequently than do females, 
he wonders if males are generally more conciliatory than females, and 
speculates on the differences between the sexes in our own species. 
</P>
<P>
This gracefully written book is unabashedly political, referring frequently to 
contemporary issues to make a point. Concerned about survival, De Waal in 1986 
signed the Seville Statement which asserted that "Biology does not condemn 
humanity to war." But unlike the other signatories, who felt that we could rise 
above our biological destiny (through intelligence, one supposes, and 
restraint), De Waal believes it is that very biological heritage that provides 
us with the mechanisms of reconciliation which he urges us to develop. We are 
creatures of evolution, and have arrived where we are because we are able to 
control and channel our aggressions. Peacemaking is not only desirable, it is, 
in a sense, evolutionarily prescribed.
