   A medical research laboratory targeted by
animal welfare activists faces a $2,500 for harassing two
Agriculture Department inspectors at the facility during a 1987
visit.
   The Agriculture Department's chief administrative judge, Victor
W. Palmer, on Monday ordered Sema Inc. to comply with ``every
provision of the Animal Welfare Act'' and not to interfere with
federal inspections.
   Animal rights activists claim the suburban Washington lab
mistreats its chimpanzees and other animals used in viral research
under contract with the National Institutes of Health.
   The two veterinary inspectors who work for the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service said company employees prevented them
from taking pictures of cages, decoding information about the
animals and driving away from the lab on June 29, 1987.
   In a follow-up report at the lab, the inspectors reported
finding deficiencies in sanitation that were ``suggestive of
violations'' of regulations, but concluded Sema did not violate the
welfare act.
   Sema President John Landon and his attorney declined comment on
the order until they saw it writing.
   The company has 35 days to appeal the decision.
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is based in
Washington, has publicly shown films it claims were taken at Sema
during a burglary, allegedly by an underground animal rights group.
Chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall has also publicly criticized the
company about the size of cages and other treatment of chimps there.
   Sema had a $1.5 million-a-year contract with NIH for research
into simian AIDS and hepatitis at the end of last year and was
conducting experiments on nearly 500 monkeys, chimpanzees,
woodchucks and other animals. PETA has long complained that Sema
has one of the highest mortality rates for its animals in the
country, but the company denies that allegation.
