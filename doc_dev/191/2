   An 82-year-old house built by an explorer,
engineer and naturalist will become the new home of the institute
that supports naturalist Jane Goodall, famous for her 28 years of
chimpanzee research.
   A variance allowing the Jane Goodall Institute to use the house
for its offices, a museum and a classroom was approved Wednesday by
the Tucson Board of Adjustment.
   The house was built by Godfrey Sykes, founder of the local
Desert Laboratory. He named it Dar es Salaam after the East African
port city he visited in 1912, said Georgiana Boyer, Sykes'
granddaughter. She said the name means ``haven of peace'' in Arabic.
   Dar es Salaam also happens to be where Ms. Goodall lives when
she's not following chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in
Tanzania.
   ``I was amazed, just totally amazed _ it just seemed unreal _
when I heard that this house was called Dar es Salaam,'' Ms.
Goodall said in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C.
   The institute functions as Goodall's U.S. office and arranges
her annual lecture tour.
   The new headquarters will include a museum and a library
featuring Ms. Goodall's handwritten field notebooks of chimpanzee
behavior.
