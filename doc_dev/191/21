   Former astronaut John Glenn and undersea
explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau are among 15 recipients of $10,000
cash and crystal globes awarded by the National Geographic Society
on its 100th anniversary.
   Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to reach the summit of Mount
Everest, and Robert D. Ballard, the Navy scientist who discovered
the sunken remains of the Titanic, also were among the pioneers
selected for society's ``Centennial Awards,'' which will be
presented Thursday.
   Other winners:
   _Bradford Washburn and Barbara Washburn for cartography and
mountaineering. The Washburns spent seven years creating a precise,
large-scale map of the Grand Canyon. Barbara Washburn was the first
women to reach the summit of Mount McKinley, North America's highest
peak.
   _Frank C. Craighead Jr. and John J. Craighead, biology and
ecology. The Craigheads were pioneers in the use of satellites for
radio tracking of animals and are known especially for their
research on grizzly bears.
   _Harold E. Edgerton, who developed the method of using strobe
lights to freeze action in pictures, allowing for the photography of
hummingbirds and other extraordinarily fast creatures and objects.
He also pioneered the underwater camera and side-scan sonar for
ocean research.
   _Thayer Soule, lecturer. Soule has shared his knowledge of the
world and its peoples with film and lectures since 1947.
   _Mary D. Leakey and Richard E. Leakey, for their research into
the beginnings of mankind. The Leakeys, from a first breakthrough in
1959, have made a series of discoveries of bones of ancestors of
modern humans.
   _George F. Bass, underwater archeologist, for his work in
increasing the understanding of the ancient world through
exploration of shipwrecks.
   _Jane Goodall, for her pioneering research of chimpanzees in
Tanzania, the longest continuous field research ever conducted on a
wild animal.
   _Kenan D. Ballard for a lifetime of work unearthing and restoring
the ancient classical Greek city of Aphrodisias, in present Turkey.
   Glenn, now a Democratic senator from Ohio, was the first American
to orbit the earth. Hillary was honored both for his famed climb of
Everest and his subsequent work in creating schools, hospitals and a
national park in the region.
   ``One mark of great individuals is their ability to look byond
areas of expertise to see the larger picture _ to understand the
problems facing us all and to do something about them,'' said the
society's president, Gilbert M. Grosvenor.
