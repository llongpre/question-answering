<LEADPARA>  IMAGINE a small cube of a cage, 3 feet by 3 feet. Within this cube lives a
primate -- often a baboon or a rhesus monkey -- that might weigh as much as 55
pounds.;   Baboons usually stand on all fours, but in such a space they cannot
walk anywhere, or even stand. Yet this is common caging for the animals used
for scientific and medical research in the United States today. Is this humane?  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Commentary; John Melcher practiced veterinary medicine before his election in
1969 to Congress. He served 20 years in the House and Senate as a Montana

<TEXT>     In 1985, Congress refined the Animal Welfare Act with the aim of improving
conditions for the thousands of laboratory animals now used in the United
States for experimentation and research. I sponsored an amendment to that law
calling for changes in the care of primates -- chimpanzees, baboons, rhesus
and other monkeys -- to enhance their "psychological well-being.";   Personal
outrage; I insisted on the amendment after visiting a research facility of the
National Institutes of Health near Washington. To my shock and dismay, I found
that the primates were confined in individual cages about the size of a small
shower stall.;   These well-built steel structures were to be the "homes" of
individual animals for several years. I also learned that only a few
facilities routinely provided even limited exercise for the animals out of the
cages.;   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has now promulgated regulations
to enforce the law, but unfortunately it has failed on two important issues:
primate cage size and the exercise of dogs.;   The same cages; The new USDA
regulations specify exactly the same cage sizes for primates that weigh as
much as 105 pounds: Envision a small cell 3 1/2 feet wide and 8 feet long with
a 7-foot ceiling and you have the picture. The smaller 3-foot cages are deemed
suitable for primates weighing as much as 55 pounds.;   One of the regulations
requires provision for "normal postural adjustment" by the animals.
Apparently, NIH and USDA believe "normal" adjustments are met as long as the
baboon confined in one of the 3-foot cubes can stand on all four feet, turn
around and sit down. But what about standing upright, lying down stretched out
or stretching their arms? And in some research institutions animals live in
their cages for years and are only occasionally let out.;   Is it humane for
these animals to be so confined?;   Also unkind to dogs; Congressional intent
on exercise for dogs also is not met in the new regulations. The new
regulations require only that individually caged dogs be released. This
excludes dogs that are confined two at a time in a double cage system or in
other groupings. USDA officials offer as a rationale for this that dogs in
double cages can exercise all the time and thus need not be released.;   The
USDA veterinarians add that since another regulation provides for daily
cleaning of the cages, such as in the case of a double-size cage with two
beagles, the only feasible method would be to remove the beagles to clean the
cage. In other words, while the dogs are out of the cage they can exercise as
they wish.;   Good for research, too; There is an axiom that the best medical
research is performed on normal, healthy animals and that some research
results may be questionable when abnormal animals are used. Indeed, the
"psychological well-being" amendment has resulted in improvements and
innovations at a significant number of research facilities.;   Keeping a
primate alone in a small cage for years degrades psychological well-being,
according to many primatologists, including Jane Goodall.;   There is a
lawsuit in federal court to address the inadequacies of the regulations. As a
former legislator, I would be disappointed if the issue could not be settled
without leaving it for a court decision.;   University research institutions
tend to brush off criticism from animal-rights activists as an effort to limit
medical research. Yet there is plenty of room for improving the care of
animals while advancing research. These dual causes do, in fact, complement
each other.  </TEXT>
