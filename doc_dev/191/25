   A Virginia Tech cadet was abducted by a
group of masked students who shaved his head in an attack that
apparently was sparked by an ice-throwing incident at a football
game, school officials said Tuesday.
   ``I think it's some overzealous behavior on the part of some
students who acted with malice,'' said Thomas Goodale, vice
president for student affairs. One of the eight to 10 students
accused of abducting and injuring Steve Woodberry, 19, of
Nokesville, has been arrested. More arrests are expected, Goodale
said.
   Woodberry was listed in stable condition with a bruised brain at
Roanoke Memorial Hospital.
   Jennings Cole II, 19, of Front Royal, faces charges of abduction,
hazing and malicious wounding, school officials said. All the
students involved are believed to be members of the Corps of Cadets
Highty Tighty band, but the university does not hold the corps
responsible, Goodale said.
   Goodale said he did not consider the incident to have been
hazing, but rather ``a personal matter between students.''
   Goodale said the attack occurred in the early morning hours
Thursday when the students wearing ski masks knocked on Woodberry's
door, abducted him and took him to a campus duck pond where they
shaved his head with an electric razor. The episode appeared to have
been thoroughly plotted, with some students standing guard, Goodale
said.
   The attack was broken up when Virginia Tech police on a routine
patrol came along, he said. One of the students' ski masks was
removed, leading to Cole's arrest Monday, he said.
   Woodberry was initially treated on campus and released Friday. He
participated in a field exercise that day but was taken to
Montgomery Regional Hospital on Sunday when other students became
concerned about a bad headache he had.
   The attack apparently was prompted by an ice-throwing incident at
the Virginia Tech-West Virginia football game on Oct. 1, Goodale
said.
   Woodberry has since left the band.
