   EDITOR'S NOTE _ To Cynthia Moss, who spent years in the wilds of
Africa, elephants are special, endearing animals. In her book,
``Elephant Memories,'' she tells why, describing the close familial
relationships and bonding among elephants. ``I want people to know
that so they care enough to save them,' she says.

   Cynthia Moss, native of Ossining, N.Y.,
philosophy major at Smith College and magazine researcher-reporter
for four years, took a five-week vacation when she was 27 to visit
a friend in Africa.
   ``I went to see one of the last wilderness areas, but I ended up
falling in love with the country,'' she says.
   And later with elephants.
   So much so that without any scientific training, she has become
an authority on the elephants of Amboseli National Park in Kenya
and has published an account based on 13 years of observing the
population and its behavior through periods of drought and
scarcity, plentiful rain and overabundance. She watched as
poachers, Masai warriors, injury, disease and tourists interfered.
Some survived. Some did not.
   Her book, ``Elephant Memories,'' tells much about the intricate
bonding among elephants and the elaborate kinship throughout their
lives.
   It's a story of a matriarchal society with rings and rings of
relationships, from the most intense, the mother and her newborn
calf, to the mother and her other immature offspring, through
family units, bond groups and clans.
   Moss was able to observe the canniness of the older matriarchs
in times of drought. Confirming the powers of elephants' memories,
they remembered from previous droughts where vegetation was most
likely to survive and so they managed. In tough times, she found,
elephants break up into smaller groups to forage more effectively.
   She saw that family members will risk danger, charging the
poachers to protect their own, while more distant clan members will
run.
   ``The book is not just about numbers,'' says Moss, director of
elephant research in the park. ``I want people to realize how
special elephants are. How funny, how endearing they can be. I want
people to know that so they care enough to save them.''
   She writes of the elephantine joy as they greet each other after
a separation, or as young males gleefully play-fight with each
other. She writes about elephant grief as the mother of a dead calf
tries to force grass into her mouth to bring it back to life and
tries over and over to hoist it to its feet.
   She writes with wonder about what is going on in their brains as
they come upon the bones of an elephant and minutely inspect them,
throwing them in the air, perhaps to decipher the correct obituary.
   One prestigious critic, who liked the book, accused her of
anthropomorphizing the behemoths.
   ``That's a rather out-of-date thing to say,'' retorts Moss. ``A
scientist would not make that accusation. That is all part of field
work.''
   Moss considers herself lucky for getting a head start in her
field work by being offered a research assistant's job by Iain
Douglas-Hamilton, a pioneer in using extensive photography so that
he could eventually recognize over 500 individual elephants in a
study in Tanzania. Moss worked with him for several years before
embarking on her own.
   ``Today, it would be almost impossible to do it the way I did
it,'' she says. ``For someone with no field experience to get a
paying job would be almost impossible.''
   She estimates that her research, paid for mainly by the African
Wildlife Foundation, the Merlin Foundation and the New York
Zoological Society, probably cost $100,000 for her nearly 20 years
in the wild.
   Moss did not live all alone for long periods, such as Jane
Goodall did initially in her studies of chimpanzees, or the late
Diane Fossey in her gorilla work. Other researchers were nearby.
