   EDITOR'S NOTE _ An Atlanta research center has made significant
contributions to the treatment of disease over the years. But those
breakthroughs have come though experimentation with monkeys and
apes, and that has incensed animal rights activists who frequently
stage protest demonstrations at the center. The director of the
center has received death threats and other staff members say they
fear for their personal safety.

   Tucked into a wooded corner of Emory University's
suburban campus, the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center has
long exuded an air of mystery.
   Security fences and ``Private Property'' signs greet those who
find their way down a winding two-lane road behind Emory dorms and
offices, through the woods, past a secluded lake.
   Here for years white-coated scientists have labored quietly to
find, through study and experimentation with monkeys and apes,
answers to health problems that plague humans.
   But now there's an us-against-them feeling at Yerkes. The
researchers' pride in their accomplishments is tempered by
frustration, anger and even fear. A growing band of crusaders would
like nothing more than to shut the center down.
   ``I wasn't hired to do this, you know,'' grumbles Dr. Frederick
A. King Jr., having to explain to yet another reporter the steps
Yerkes takes to conduct its research as humanely as possible.
   King, an outspoken advocate of animal research and the director
of Yerkes for a decade, has been the target of death threats. His
center, an arm of Emory University and one of seven regional primate
research centers sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, has
been the site of numerous protests by animal rights activists.
   Last December, 12 people were arrested on the Emory campus in a
demonstration against the use of animals in scientific research, the
second such protest in a month. Three of those arrested lowered
themselves on ropes down the front of a six-story building and
unfurled a huge banner reading ``Save the Yerkes Chimps.'' The other
nine tried to block the university's main gate. Members of the
California-based group In Defense of Animals said the protest marked
the beginning of a two-year campaign against centers like Yerkes.
   Elsewhere in the nation, buildings have been burned and animal
rights activists have been arrested with bombs. Yerkes staffers say
they sometimes wonder about their personal safety.
   King says he has ``good reason to believe'' that virtually every
institution like his has been infiltrated by animal-rights activists.
   But his chief worry, King says, is that the animal rights
movement could diminish the effectiveness of the center, a place
where new techniques for treating Parkinson's disease were found,
where ape communication studies led to new ways of teaching retarded
children.
   ``What I am afraid of,'' he says, ``is that these people may get
bills passed in Congress, regulations passed through federal
agencies, that could be terribly, terribly injurious to research,
terribly restrictive and costly beyond belief.
   ``That's my fear, that they will whittle us down _ not that they
will knock us out of the box. By their acts of violence and
terrorism, breaking, entering, bomb threats, destroying property,
stealing animals, falsifying photographs of this and that, they cost
us a hell of a lot of money.''
   The center, named for its founder, Dr. Robert M. Yerkes, a
primate research pioneer, has three locations: the main station,
with labs and offices; a southeast Atlanta language lab, and the
field station, a spartan 117 acres in suburban Gwinnett County where
1,500 primates _ from 1,000 rhesus monkeys to a small family of
pygmy chimpanzees _ live in two dozen separately housed groups.
   Add to that 13 gorillas and a dozen orangutans at Zoo Atlanta
under an unusual and popular arrangement.
   The Zoo Atlanta project, in which primates roam in open-air
approximations of their original habitats, has spurred an ambitious
renovation plan that has brought the once-beleaguered zoo new-found
respect and thousands of new visitors.
   It's also good public relations for Yerkes, as it presents the
center's name to happy zoo visitors gazing at cuddly looking
creatures.
   It's also an ongoing research effort. Yerkes scientists continue
to study the behavior and reproduction of the gorillas and
orangutans at the zoo. In particular, Yerkes staffers and Atlantans
in general hope that Zoo Atlanta mainstay, Willie B., a gorilla who
spent nearly three decades in a cage, will settle down with a Yerkes
female in his new outdoor playground and have little Willies.
   But most of the Yerkes animals are at the field station, a large
site once out in the country, but now rapidly being surrounded by
subdivisions.
   It is there, amid heated concrete shelters and fenced-in pens,
that some 30 research scientists and animal care technicians work
with sooty mangabeys, squirrel monkeys, chimps, and that staple of
research labs, rhesus monkeys.
   On a recent winter's day, field station coordinator and research
professor Tom Gordon, strolled up to a gymnasium-size pen housing
hundreds of rhesus monkeys and started calling them by name.
   ``You get to know them after a while,'' he says.
   Yerkes scientists continually observe the monkeys, looking for
new behavioral characteristics. Even in the largest colonies, one
monkey is king, and a social hierarchy flows downward from him, his
mate and her offspring, with other families acting subservient.
   While some of the rhesus colony are taken from time to time for
lab experiments at the main station, others live on at the field
station for generations in an ongoing behavioral study.
   Another primate group getting a great deal of attention at the
field station these days is a collection of sooty mangabeys who, as
it turns out, are almost universally infected with SIV _ simian
immunodeficiency virus, a close cousin of HIV, or human
immunodeficiency virus, the killer virus that causes AIDS.
   Most primates infected with SIV will become ill, as do humans
infected with HIV. But for some reason, the sooty mangabeys, for the
most part, never become clinically ill.
