   Sir Reginald Goodall, a leading conductor of the
works of Richard Wagner, has died. He was 88.
   His death was announced from a nursing home at Bridge near
Canterbury, where he died on Saturday. The cause of death was not
disclosed.
   Despite his reputation as an interpreter of Wagner, Goodall was
never principal conductor of a leading orchestra or opera company.
   During his career, he worked with the opera companies at Covent
Garden, Glyndebourne, Sadler's Wells and the English and Welsh
national companies.
   He also worked abroad as an assistant to some of the century's
greatest conductors, including Wilhelm Furtwangler, Otto Klemperer,
Clemens Krauss and Hans Knappertsbusch. He coached some of
Britain's finest Wagnerian singers _ Gwyneth Jones, Donald McIntyre
and David Ward.
   Goodall was reclusive _ his Who's Who entry occupied only four
lines _ and after a performance he would leave the podium quickly
for the musicians and singers to receive applause without him.
   He rarely used a baton, preferring to conduct with half-clenched
fists.
   British critics called him the greatest living Wagnerian in
1979, when his performances of Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde'' with
the Welsh National Opera Company were sold out.
   He was then a frail widower living alone in the Kent
countryside. He was knighted in 1985 for services to music.
   Members of the Wagner family visited Britain to hear Goodall
conduct and called him the greatest conductor of the master's music.
   He was born in the cathedral city of Lincoln, and he studied at
the Royal College of Music and then in Munich and Vienna. He was an
organist, double-bass player and choirmaster.
   In 1945, Goodall conducted the Sadler's Wells premiere of
Benjamin Britten's opera ``Peter Grimes'' but for 20 years he rose
no higher than conductor's assistant for opera companies.
   Rodney Milnes, the country's leading opera critic, wrote: ``It
says a lot about England that this towering genius should have been
on the music staff at Covent Garden for two decades and more,
serving under notably inferior musical directors and being given
virtually nothing to do. All the conductors with whom he is to be
compared are dead.''
   Critics said Goodall's high ideals, long and detailed
preparation of an opera, individual coaching of all the singers and
all the instrumental rehearsals, were too demanding for opera
houses in his own country.
   Goodall gave his last performance at the 1987 Promenade Concerts
in London, where he conducted act three of Wagner's ``Parsifal.''
   His funeral will be in Canterbury on May 14. There was no word
on any survivors.
