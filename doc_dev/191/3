<TEXT>  Birute Galdikas; By Sy Montgomery; Houghton Mifflin, 280 pp., $19.95; HERE  is
a sensitive and revealing contribution to the legend of a unique scientific
sisterhood: three pioneering women who were recruited by paleoanthropologist
Louis Leakey to go to the jungle and study the great apes for links to
humanity.;    Leakey believed women made the best observers, and that Goodall,
an Englishwoman, Fossey, an American who later was slain, and Galdikas, a
Canadian of Lithuanian extraction, had the grit to endure and the compassion
to love, respectively, the chimpanzees of Tanzania, the mountain gorillas of
Rwanda and the orangutans of Borneo.;    Sy Montgomery ably tells how Leakey's
passionate "trimates," as the primate researchers were dubbed, instinctively
violated scientific taboos and became nurturers, friends and defenders of
their study animals. This was the best way, she argues, to gain entree to the
secret lives of species that until then had been clouded in ignorance and
misunderstanding.;    The point, of course, is arguable, but the trimates were
superb. Goodall, genteel and diplomatic; Galdikas, tough and prickly; Fossey,
quirky and ruthlessly honest -- they all gave new mean-; ing to interpretive
science. Their controversial approach was totally different, based on a
privileged trust, a "contract . . . not written by the human: the animals are
the authors of the agreement.";    The three women stoutly defended their
animals and often debated each other about whose species was the most
humanlike. Skeptics would argue that such thinking, and the highly emotional
and personalized research it spawned, amounts to Darwinism in reverse, as if
chimps, gorillas and orangutans in effect were descended from man.;     Early
on, attacks on Goodall as a scientist were sexist. She was dismissed as a
"blond bimbo," her editor at National Geographic recalled. Galdikas tells how
a female professor assessed Goodall's career: "The only reason she's so famous
is because of her great legs in those short shorts in the films." Of course,
Galdikas' own image was similar.;    Today, only Goodall is accepted as a true
scientist. Galdikas hasn't published any data in 12 years. She saves
orangutans and preserves habitat. Married to a Dyak forester, by whom she has
had two children, she lives the life of a middle-aged rain-forest queen.;   
Fossey was driven to distraction by those who kept killing what she came to
regard as her gorillas. She wept at cruelty, wept at the courage displayed by
animals, wept at the uncaring attitude of native Africans. But as Montgomery
notes, an African, unless his or her tribal heritage had been modified by
Western education, would have laughed.;    So Fossey fought back with
anti-poaching squads, tortured poachers, burned their possessions, even
kidnapped their children. In 1985, she paid with her life. Martyrdom, perhaps,
may accomplish what she herself couldn't. (box)  </TEXT>
