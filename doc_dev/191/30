<HEAD>Yerkes Establishes Sperm Bank For Chimpanzees</HEAD>

   The nation's first sperm bank for chimpanzees is
designed to meet the increasing demand for animals by AIDS
researchers, the bank's founder says.
   Chimpanzees are highly valued in research because they are the
closest biologically to humans. But they are a threatened species
that can no longer be captured legally in the wild.
   Dr. Kenneth G. Gould, chief of reproductive biology at the
Yerkes Regional Primate Center, said researchers there and at other
centers around the world infect the animals with AIDS to study the
progress of the disease in an animal with an immune system similar
to man's.
   Unlike man, the animals do not die of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, but they can spread the virus and therefore are not
allowed to breed after being infected.
   ``I'm glad to hear about his success,'' said Dr. Duane C.
Kraemer, a specialist in primate reproduction and a Texas A&amp;M
University professor. ``It's important that we develop techniques
for sperm storage and artificial insemination for a number of
species.''
   The bank will help breeders maintain a genetically diverse
population of captive chimps and give scientists a model for
developing sperm banks for other primates such as gorillas.
   For more than three decades, scientists have frozen human and
cattle sperm successfully, but the same formulas did not prevent
ice crystals from destroying the chimpanzee sperm until Gould's
success.
   Gould began freezing the chimpanzee sperm in 1986, and
eventually found that it had to be frozen more slowly than that of
other species.
