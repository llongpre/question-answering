   A biomedical foundation is establishing a
pension plan for 81 AIDS-infected chimpanzees.
   The Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research plans to invest
more than $1.77 million over the next 10 years into chimpanzee
retirement accounts that are expected to grow into $2.9 million
through the year 2026, officials said.
   ``We always have had a moral obligation to take care of the
animals that we use, but we can have the best intentions in the
world, but if we don't have the money, there is little that we can
do for them,'' John Speck, controller of the biomedical foundation.
   The fund will help in their care and is sure to be enough to buy
bunches of bananas and lots of apples, cucumbers, celery and
watermelon over the next 40 years for the chimpanzees, who cannot be
used for other research after being exposed to AIDS.
   But Roger Fouts, a psychology professor at Central Washington
University in Ellensberg who has studied chimpanzees for 20 years,
said the biomedical foundation's humanitarian attempt is admirable,
but it might not be enough.
   ``If you look at $3 million for about 40 years, that's bare
minimum,'' he said. ``Giving a chimp enough food, enough water and
making sure that they have a dry and warm cage doesn't seem to be
enough.''
   Foundation officials said the chimps exposed to the AIDS virus
have shown no signs they have developed the fatal disease. It is
probable the chimps will live their normal life span of about 40
years or more, pushing their care bill to $5,000 each annually, they
said.
   The biomedical foundation is among the leading facilities
worldwide that conducts AIDS research using primates.
   Speck and Dr. Jorg Eichberg, director of veterinary resources,
began discussing two years ago how to pay for care for the chimps,
and started the investment program in the spring.
   Eichberg, who in June 1983 became the first scientist to infect a
chimpanzee with the AIDS virus, said he hopes the chimp retirement
program would silence animals rights groups critical of the
foundation's use of animals for experiments.
   ``We are really genuinely concerned that these animals get the
best treatment available,'' Eichberg says. ``We have to combine our
emotions with pragmatism in our work and I think we have done a
pretty good job.''
   But Fouts said research groups should do more for the chimpanzees.
   ``They must ensure that they lead as much as possible a normal
life,'' he said. ``What we have with chimpanzees is a species that
has been exploited by biomedical concerns, but this attempt by the
Southwest foundation to help the chimpanzees is an admirable one.''
