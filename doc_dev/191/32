   A recently isolated chimpanzee virus is more
closely related to the human AIDS virus than other AIDS-related
monkey viruses are, and may be a ``missing link'' between human and
primate versions, scientists say.
   However, the finding does not resolve the question of whether
the AIDS virus originated in humans or in animals, scientists said.
   Analysis of the chimpanzee virus is presented in Thursday's
issue of the British journal Nature by scientists from Gabon and
from the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
   The virus was identified in two wild chimpanzees in the West
African nation and isolated from one of them. It is classified as a
lentivirus, the same category that includes HIV-1, which causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the United States.
   Other lentiviruses, called simian immunodeficiency viruses or
SIVs, have been found in four kinds of monkeys: macaques, sooty
mangabeys, African green monkeys and mandrills.
   Analysis of the new virus showed it was the first non-human
lentivirus to contain the same overall genetic structure as HIV-1,
the researchers reported. And when the protein products of its
genes were studied, they were more like those of HIV-1 than those
of the simian viruses tested.
   Nonetheless, when compared to the range of known genetic
variants of HIV-1, the chimp virus lay outside that range, the
researchers said.
   They suggested it might be called chimpanzee immunodeficiency
virus.
   Only two of 83 chimps tested in Gabon carried the virus,
indicating it is not widespread there, they reported. And none of
more than 250 chimpanzees caught over the last 15 to 20 years in
West Africa showed evidence of the virus.
   The two chimps in which the virus was found were both infants in
relatively good health. If the virus had made them ill with
anything like AIDS, they probably would not have survived predators
in the jungle, researchers said.
   It is not possible to conclude that the chimp virus was a
precursor to HIV-1, and even if it were, analysis indicates that it
could not be the immediate precursor, they said.
   But the virus may be a form of ``missing link'' between the
African Old World primate viruses and HIV-1, wrote Ronald
Desrosiers of the New England Regional Primate Research Center in
Southborough, Mass.
   He agreed that the discovery does not settle the question of
whether HIV-1 originated in humans or came from a non-human
ancestor. But further study of the isolate may shed light on it, he
said in a Nature editorial.
