FT  17 MAY 94 / People: Goodall takes on another chair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manweb, the Cheshire-based regional electricity company, has become the
latest power group to appoint a relative outsider to one of its two senior
posts. Bill Goodall, on the company's board for less than a year, is to take
over as non-executive chairman at the end of August.
He will succeed Bryan Weston who is retiring after 45 years in the industry.
Before privatisation four years ago, the way to the top in electricity was a
lifetime in the industry. Weston's appointment yesterday means that half of
the 12 regional electricity companies have chairmen who have spent the bulk
of their careers in other industries.
The Manweb appointment means Goodall, 62, now chairs four companies; the
others are Volex, electrical controls group, Hopkinsons, engineer, and
Inveresk, paper manufacturer.
Goodall began his career as a management trainee with Scapa Dryers in 1956
after graduating from Pembroke College, Cambridge, and Leeds University.
From there he rose to be chairman of Scapa Group, a post he relinquished
last October.
