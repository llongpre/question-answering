   Sigourney Weaver has been known as a
courageous actress. But as the late naturalist Dian Fossey in
``Gorillas in the Mist,'' she has outdone herself.
   In earlier films she battled outer space demons (``Alien,''
``Aliens''), revolution (``The Year of Living Dangerously'') and
evil spirits (``Ghostbusters''). The new movie shows her in
conditions of genuine peril: working with silverback gorillas in
the mountain jungles of Rwanda without a double or net _ nothing
between her and a beast that could crush her in an instant.
   Fossey was murdered in Rwanda in her sleep. Her colleagues, who
considered her an eccentric, said she had angered local residents
with her aggressive efforts to restrict poaching.
   Weaver, 38, was born into the entertainment business. Her father
is Sylvester (Pat) Weaver, the NBC president considered to be the
architect of modern television. Her mother is the former actress
Elizabeth Inglis. After Stanford University and the Yale School of
Drama, she worked her way from off-Broadway to films.
   On a recent visit from her New York home, she talked about her
African experience in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Q. You don't pick easy pictures, do you?
   A. (laughing) That's probably true. My father says that if I
open a script and it takes place in Alaska with a lot of huskies
and I fall through the ice, I'll probably do it instead of a lovely
picture on the French Riviera.
   Q. Did you know about Dian Fossey and her work?
   A. I had gotten her book when it first came out. I had also been
at Stanford when they started that human-primate program where you
could live with an ape in your trailer and do your thesis on it.
Jane Goodall had come and spoken to us.
   After I read Dian's book (``Gorillas in the Mist'') I thought,
``They can't make a picture out of this; she is too difficult a
woman to be portrayed on the screen.'' I also thought logistically
it would be a nightmare. How could you possibly create the whole
atmosphere of the gorillas?
   Q. Were you involved in the joining of Universal and Warner
Bros. (which had competing projects)?
   A. No. I was approached by each studio separately. By the time
(producer) Arnie Glimcher approached me for Universal, I said,
``Arnie, I don't want to get involved with a picture that's not
going to happen.'' I thought they would knock each other out.
   Q. Once the deal was made, weren't you overwhelmed by the danger
involved?
   A. Not really. I was reading a lot of Dian's papers and
rereading her book, and it seemed that she was often threatened by
gorillas, but they never actually hurt her. It was all a question
of getting to know each other.
   I didn't see why they would feel animosity toward me. That was a
lucky choice on my part. I don't think it would be wise go in and
to work with animals without having previously reassured yourself
that you would be all right.
   I was intimidated by trying to gather all the information about
Dian. So much of it was conflicting. And so much of it was hearsay.
She had a very negative reputation within her field, and she was
considered to be a very difficult woman. I heard people say some
pretty hard things about her. And some very loving things as well.
   Q. What kind of a person was she?
   A. She was a mass of opposites, I think. Everything you can say
about Dian, the opposite is probably true. She loved people, she
loved partying. ... On the other hand she shunned people, she
preferred to be with animals. She lived up in this isolated place,
tramping around in mud, yet she loved to go out in fancy clothes.
She always slept with curlers in her hair, even when she lived up
on top of the mountain.
   She is such an amazing collection of different things. I guess I
grew very fond of her. I was lucky to have access to her letters
and her camp notes through a colleague of hers. She really put
herself in those letters. I developed such an admiration for her
thoroughness, her commitment, her humor _ she was always making
jokes about herself. She had a wicked sense of humor, and I hope
that comes across in the film.
   Q. Did you train for the rigors of the location?
   A. In the press release, it says I ran up these volcanic
mountains in Hawaii. (laughing) I don't know where they got that. I
did walk up a hill behind my parents-in-law's house in Hawaii every
morning for about two weeks. I don't think any of us could have
gotten in shape for (the location). You had to get used to the
altitude and slowly get used to the climbs. It was difficult for
everyone except the Australians; they were very macho about the
whole thing.
   You were in such a beautiful part of the world and you were
perhaps going to see gorillas at the end of the climb or you were
going to the top of the mountain to shoot a scene.
   Q. What was your first encounter with the gorillas?
   A. We didn't think we were going to see gorillas that day. It
turned out they were only 5 minutes away from Dian's camp. We took
off through a beautiful forest filled with wild orchids. We heard a
great outburst of pock-pock sounds, which is the sound they make
beating their chests. I looked up and saw this big gorilla standing
halfway up the hill.
   You're so amazed to suddenly be in their territory; it was like
you had walked into another era. I just forgot, I was so entranced.
It was like walking into a forest and seeing a unicorn. You forgot
your fear, you just went ahead.
   I went up to where they were all sitting around munching, though
I couldn't see them. This little gorilla came out to me and sat
down and touched my camera. She was very curious, taking me in in a
matter-of-fact way. She jumped away after she had visited, and I
was agog. It was an indescribable feeling.
   I just found out last week that that sweet little girl had been
caught in a poacher's trap ... and she didn't make it. There aren't
many females, and coming from a very good family, she would have
been a good mate.
   Q. Were you well-coached on how to behave with the gorillas?
   A. I kind of learned it as I went along. In the picture are a
couple of scary scenes where the silverback comes down right next
to me. They all happened the first times we went out. So I was kind
of thrown into the deep end.
