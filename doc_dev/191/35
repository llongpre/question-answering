   Dr. Melvin M. Payne, chairman emeritus of the
National Geographic Society's board of trustees, has died of
pneumonia, the society said Monday. He was 79.
   Payne, who began his career with the society in 1932 as a
secretary and served both as president and chairman of the board,
died on Saturday.
   During his tenure as head of the society's research division, he
provided support for such projects as Capt. Jacques Cousteau's
underwater explorations, the first American ascent of Mt. Everest,
and Jane Goodall's study of wild chimpanzees.
   He also was instrumental in beginning the series of hour-long
public television programs that highlight the society's work.
   An attorney, Payne completed his legal studies while working as
secretary to former chairman emeritus Thomas V. McKnew. He was
named a vice president in 1958 and joined the board of trustees
later that year.
   He was named president in 1967 and in 1976 was elected chairman
of the society's board of trustees. He has served as chairman
emeritus since 1987.
   Survivors include Payne's wife Ethel McDonnell Payne of
Bethesda, Md., two daughters, a brother, a sister, three
grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.
