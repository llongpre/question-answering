   A retirement program for chimpanzees used in
hepatitis and AIDS research will house them in $63,000
air-conditioned bungalows, repayment for the apes' service to
humanity, a researchers says.
   ``We don't think of any of the animals as just tools of
research,'' said Dr. Jorg Eichberg, director of veterinary
resources at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research.
``They've done so much for mankind, this is one way we can pay them
back.''
   A $2.9 million ``pension'' fund is being established at a San
Antonio bank with some of the chimps' ``earnings'' _ the research
grants and fees private and government research institutions pay to
use the animals, The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday.
   A separate fund will pay for 12 air-conditioned retirement huts,
at a cost of $63,000 each, to house chimp retirees.
   Plans also are under way to build a playground for the chimps
similar to the $270,000 breeding colony now in use _ a large, airy
complex complete with swings, tires and grass.
   Huts inhabited by the animals during research have 19-inch color
televisions, but the retirees will have to do without, Eichberg
said.
   ``The retired chimps can visit with each other,'' he said.
``They don't get bored enough to watch TV.''
   The Journal of Medical Primatology has touted the plan as a
model for other research centers, the newspaper reported.
   The 192 chimps at the Southwest Foundation comprise one of the
world's largest captive colonies.
   Currently, 45 are used in research for vaccines against
hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS. The rest are used in other private and government
medical research or for breeding.
   In 1983, Eichberg became the first scientist in the world to
infect a chimpanzee with HIV. That chimp, 15-year-old Paul, is now
in retirement at the foundation.
   Since the chimps can't be used for other research _ and since
chimps can live to age 50 _ Southwest Foundation researchers felt
the need to find some way to take care of them. Officials said they
expect the retirement colony eventually to include 80 chimps.
   The foundation spends about $1 million a year, or $17 a day per
chimp, to feed and maintain its animals, according to foundation
president Duncan Wimpress.
