   Scentists today reported the discovery of what
may be the ``missing link'' between human and certain primate
versions of the AIDS virus.
   However, the finding does not resolve the question of whether
the AIDS virus originated in humans or in animals, the researchers
said.
   Genetic analysis of a recently found chimpanzee virus shows it
is more closely related to the human AIDS virus than it is to other
AIDS-related monkey viruses, scientists from Gabon and the Pasteur
Institute in Paris reported in the British journal nature.
   The virus was identified in two wild chimpanzees in Gabon. It is
classified as a lentivirus, the same category that includes HIV-1,
which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the United
States.
   Other lentiviruses, called simian immunodeficiency viruses or
SIVs, have been found in four kinds of monkeys: macaques, sooty
mangabeys, African green monkeys and mandrills.
   Analysis of the new virus showed it was the first non-human
lentivirus to contain the same overall genetic structure as HIV-1,
the researchers reported. And when the protein products of its
genes were studied, they were more like those of HIV-1 than those
of the simian viruses tested.
   Nonetheless, when compared to the range of known genetic
variants of HIV-1, the chimp virus lay outside that range, the
researchers said. They suggested it might be called chimpanzee
immunodeficiency virus.
   It is not possible to conclude that the chimp virus was a
precursor to HIV-1, and even if it were, analysis indicates that it
could not be the immediate precursor, they said.
   Further study may shed light on whether the AIDS virus
originated in people or came from an animal virus, a primate
specialist observed in an accompanying editorial.
   The virus may be a form of ``missing link'' between the African
Old World primate viruses and the AIDS virus, wrote Ronald
Desrosiers of the New England Regional Primate Research Center in
Southborough, Mass.
