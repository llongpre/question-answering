REGGIE: THE LIFE OF REGINALD GOODALL by John Lucas Julia MacRae Books Pounds
18.99, 254 pages
REGINALD GOODALL, one of the leading British conductors of the century and
one of the elite among postwar Wagnerians, began his career with great (if
unevenly acknowledged) spurts of promise. He ended it, in advanced old age,
with a knighthood, magnificent recordings of The Ring (this month re-issued
on CD), Tristan and Parsifal to his credit, and the reverence of almost all
British Wagner-lovers.
In between, he endured a period of cruel neglect ' a staff conductor at the
Royal Opera House misunderstood, sidelined and eventually shelved, who for
ten years found his conducting dates there dwindled to non-existence
(between the 1961 Boris Godunov revival and the 1971 Parsifal).
Even during that time, of course, he was not reduced to total artistic
ineffectiveness. Otto Klemperer demanded his presence as assistant on those
late Klemperer recording sessions - the admiration between the two was
mutual, as it had been between Goodall and another leading conductor, Erich
Kleiber, and as it was to be between him and Kleiber's son Carlos. More to
the point, in his little eyrie at Covent Garden (nicknamed, naturally
enough, Valhalla) Goodall continued on the ewige Werk begun in the middle
1950s - the schooling of successive generations of British and Britain-based
Wagner singers to eloquence and international fame.
But then came the 1968 Sadler's Wells Opera Mastersingers - unforgettable in
the small theatre, repeated to even more splendid effect when the company
moved home to the Coliseum, where already the glorious adventure of the
English-language Ring was set to unfold.
Those performances, and the Welsh National Tristan and Valkyrie and ENO
Tristan and Parsifal of the late 1970s and '80s, amounted to a revelation of
long-lined, lovingly rehearsed, sagaciously sustained Wagner performance -
every instrumental line suffused with lyricism, every voice part unforced,
every word and note audible. These unforgettable evenings placed Goodall in
the grand line of Wagnerian conductors.
The Goodall 'galley years' at Covent Garden, as a chapter-title in John
Lucas's new biography aptly calls them, are therefore the more depressing to
contemplate when one holds them in the light of both the late triumphs and
the early career progress. In truth, little in his upbringing seemed likely
to promote that musical career; and the hand-to-mouth conditions, blinkered
British-is-best tastes and unwarranted self-satisfaction that obtained in
the musical life of this country for much of Goodall's early adulthood
seemed designed positively to frustrate it.
In spite of that, and of the combination of shyness, eccentricity, and
intransigence in search of high musical standards that marked his
personality, Goodall's achievements as choirmaster at St Alban's, Holborn,
and with the short-lived Wessex Philharmonic Orchestra forced him,
gradually, up the British musical ladder. The peak of thatearly period was
his conducting of the 1945 premiere of Peter Grimes: the Britten connection
led him in the postwar years to the newly formed opera company at Covent
Garden. But later that connection was broken (Britten took offence at some
small slight) and the gradual but inexorable decline in his fortunes as a
conductor set in.
This is a tale alternately saddening and exhilarating to read. Lucas -
husband of Anne Evans, Goodall devotee, a former Observer Arts Editor -
tells it excellently: even for those British opera-lovers who think they
know the ins and outs of it already, his Reggie will surely prove a
compelling and fascinating read.
The picture painted of Britten and his circle in the Grimes and early
Aldeburgh years is full of incident (some of it new to print), intrigue and
passions running high on all sides. Lucas does not shirk the snobbery,
prevarication and shady dealing that operated at Covent Garden in the
Webster-Drogheda era, nor the rough treatment Goodall underwent at the hands
of Solti on his arrival there in 1961 - had it not been for a handful of
obstinate Goodall champions, among them the critics Andrew Porter, David
Cairns and the late Peter Heyworth, and then the Sadler's Wells visionaries
Stephen Arlen and Edmund Tracey, Goodall's name would surely have been swept
off the Royal Opera masthead sooner or later.
But above all, this is the portrait of an extremely odd man, and it is
undertaken with commendable frankness. However much one regrets the many
chances missed, one comes to appreciate the number of obstacles placed by
Goodall himself in the way of his own steady progress. Foremost among these
must stand his pre-war fascist sympathies and his post-war reluctance to
accept the full extent of the horrors unleashed by his beloved Germany.
To his unbounded credit Lucas never shrinks from the issue. Neither does he
sensationalise it - and indeed, the admiration Goodall could feel for such
Jews as Klemperer does point to the self-contradiction and simple muddle
that Lucas discerns at the core of his political ideals. In sum, this is a
first-rate biography, painstakingly researched, judiciously balanced,
crisply and lucidly written - and, as always in such cases, it illuminates
much more than simply the remarkable main subject.
