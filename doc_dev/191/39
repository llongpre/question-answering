   Central Washington University's
``talking'' chimpanzees will get a new home next year, and
fund-raising efforts are under way to give them a place to play as
well.
   While the Legislature has authorized a $1.5 million home for the
chimps, lawmakers did not finance an outdoor play and exercise area
for the five chimpanzees _ the first in the world to learn human
sign language.
   Researchers Roger and Debbi Fouts said they need to raise
$650,000 to build a secure outdoor area that will provide the
chimps with sunlight, swinging and climbing apparatus and other
benefits.
   The drive began in Seattle in January with a fund-raiser, with
Gov. Booth Gardner as host. The Fouts also intend to solicit
donations by mail.
   The new home and play area are essential for the chimps, who
have been caged on the third floor of the university's Psychology
Building for years, Fouts said.
   ``Washoe hasn't seen the sun in 10 years,'' Fouts said. Washoe
was the first animal ever to learn a human language.
   The research has been under way at the school since 1980, when
Fouts moved to this small central Washington farm and college town
from the University of Oklahoma.
   Financing has been a constant struggle.
   While Fouts is paid as a faculty member of the university, Ms.
Fouts is a volunteer, and chimp care depends on the help of up to
15 students. The university provides just $1,000 a year for the
chimps' care.
   Financial help comes from 500 subscribers who pay $25 a year for
the Fouts' newsletter. Much of the chimps' food is donated by
grocery stores and farmers, Fouts said.
   Pizza parlors occasionally donate pizzas. ``Washoe doesn't like
pepperoni,'' Ms. Fouts said.
   The new building was needed because the constant cleaning of the
animals' cages was causing water damage to the Psychology Building
and their noise disrupted classes.
   The new building, set for groundbreaking this spring and
completion next year, also will bring better public access to the
chimps, which the Fouts hope will increase donations.
   The chimps weigh up to 150 pounds and have the strength of eight
grown men, so security is important. ``People in Ellensburg
wouldn't want them walking into their houses and looking in the
refrigerator,'' Fouts said.
   The Fouts' research is behavioral, not biomedical, so a good
environment for the chimps is essential to good results.
   ``We're hoping this gives them more things to sign about, and
more interesting things to do,'' Fouts said. The ability to swing
more freely by the arms will also make the chimps happier, he said.
   To the Fouts, the Washoe Project is ``like the moon shot of the
behavioral sciences.''
