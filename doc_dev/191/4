<LEADPARA>  Goodall, 56, achieved fame for her studies of wild chimpanzees. She recently
published a book, Through a Window: My Thirty Years With the Chimpanzees of
Gombe.; Q. You've said that your approach to motherhood was strongly
influenced by observing chimps.  </LEADPARA>

INTERVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A. That's right. I made some deliberate decisions based on watching chimpanzee
mothers and infants over the years. My observations helped me understand the
importance of early experience, and the tremendous difference it can make to a
child, depending on the type of mothering he or she gets. Watching the chimps
gave me some understanding of the importance of having a really good amount of
time to spend with my son. And that this might be crucial to how he developed
when he grew older. I also saw how much fun the chimp mothers had with their
infants. I didn't want to be deprived of that. So actually I stopped following
chimps when my son was small. In the mornings I did administration, and in the
afternoon -- that was his time. For three years I never spent a single night
away from him.;    Q. In your book you mention that male chimpanzees do not
have much respect for human women.;    A. That's right, they don't. For
example, one male, Goblin, would often come and hit and pound on me. He
wouldn't do that to men. It has something to do with fear: They're less
frightened of women. I think it may also have something to do with the voice;
the male's deeper voice sounds more like their threat call. I remember we had
two visitors, a man and a woman. They had just arrived and were staying inside
a tent. The woman spoke, and the chimps stayed where they were. When the man
spoke, they ran away.;    Q. Did it surprise you to discover how warlike
chimps are?;    A. It shocked me at first. It shouldn't have surprised me,
though, because chimpanzees are so like us in every way. Why wouldn't we
expect them to have a dark side to their nature? So I'm afraid it's likely
that we do have these aggressive, territorial traits, which stem directly from
our ancient primate heritage. That doesn't mean, however, that we have to go
on being warlike, because we can control those impulses.;    Q. What are the
most striking similarities between chimps and man?;    A. Do I dare say male
dominance? I'm half kidding, but actually it is interesting that some male
chimpanzees will devote a tremendous amount of energy, and run serious risks,
to get to the top. But unlike most animal species, where getting to the top
gives you definite reproductive advantage -- you get more access to the
females, in other words -- that's not necessarily true for the chimps. So
perhaps we're not the only creature where power for power's sake is an end.
There are also similarities in non-verbal communication.;    Q. Like what?;   
A. Like kissing, embracing, patting on the back, holding hands. And they do
these things in the same context as we do them, and they seem to mean the same
sort of things. Another similarity is that chimpanzees use so many objects as
tools. They roll leaves into sort of straws to suck termites out of their
nests, for example, and they use crumbled leaves to sop up water, like a
sponge. They also use leaves like napkins. Most fascinating of all, in
different parts of Africa where chimps are being studied, there are different
tool-using cultures. For example, in the Mahale Mountains, 100 miles south of
Gombe, the chimps have learned to eat the wood-boring carpenter ants. They
poke little twigs into holes in the trees, the ants swarm out, and they eat
them. In Gombe, they have the same ants, but the chimps haven't worked out how
to eat them. They haven't hit upon it. So you can imagine that some chimp
genius of the past hit upon these things, and the local chimps learned by
observation, imitation and practice. They have the beginnings of culture, in
other words.;    Q. I got the feeling from your book that you believe that the
major difference between chimps and humans isn't intelligence, but language.
Is that true?;    A. Yes, absolutely. It's very hard to imagine doing the
things we do without language. If you have some idea in your head, you know
how words crystallize that idea? Well, we know that chimps have a lot of
cognitive ability; we've been able to teach them sign language. But if they
get ideas about something, which I'm sure they do, it's trapped inside. They
can't discuss it.;    Q. How far have chimpanzees come with sign language?;   
A. They can learn 300 or more signs. They'll make up labels for something they
don't know the name for. I remember at one point one of the chimps kept asking
a person on our staff for a "rock berry." The chimp kept making the two signs
for "rock" and "berry." This person had no idea what she meant, but it turned
out that two days earlier someone had given the chimp a brazil nut, which the
chimp had never seen before. And that was it. The chimp had put those two
words together to describe what she wanted.  </TEXT>
