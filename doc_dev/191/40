   Sheba isn't a typical 6-year-old just
because she likes candy, playing with the telephone and coloring.
   Sheba is a chimpanzee who knows how to count.
   The chimp, who lives at Ohio State University's animal
laboratory here, is one of only two monkeys in the world able to
count, and the only one that understands the concept of zero, said
Sally Boysen, director of the lab's primate cognition project.
   Boysen said last week she believes that ability is a major step
forward in defining the cognitive processes of higher primates and
their similarities to those of humans.
   Boysen, who said the ability to count objects involves a
different cognitive process than learning languages, was one of the
participants in early studies that showed higher primates can learn
language.
   More than a decade ago, Koko, a female gorilla, and Washoe, a
female chimp, learned to use sign language to communicate with
humans.
   But counting is a new research goal, and a hobby Sheba indulges
in when she is not playing with her keepers, with the four other
apes at the lab or with Boysen's dog Schuyler, who is her best
friend.
   The chimp also dials telephone numbers at random when no one is
watching.
   Sheba, a lab-born chimp owned by The Columbus Zoo, will appear
on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' this week and is the subject
of a People magazine story due out this month.
   The surrogate mother-daughter relationship between Boysen and
Sheba and their mutual teasing has helped the chimp ignore the
attention and get to work.
   In a recent demonstration, Sheba was placed on the floor in
front of a small, rectangular yellow plate. Above that was placed
plastic squares with numbers ranging from zero to seven, mixed
randomly. Boysen then placed four apples on the plate.
   ``OK, Sheba. We're going to count some apples. How many?''
Boysen asked. Sheba, fighting a desire to mug for a photographer,
touched each apple, then pointed to the number five and looked to
Boysen for approval.
   ``You know that is not five apples. Try to tell me how many,''
Boysen said. Sheba counted again and pointed to the number seven.
   It took another try and a hallway conference between Boysen and
Sheba before the ape finally ignored the photographer and picked
the correct number. Sheba was rewarded with a kiss and a handful of
M&amp;Ms and gumdrops.
   Boysen has worked with Sheba for almost five years, and says the
association has been rewarding from the start, even though Sheba
would rather be playing.
   ``They have such a short attention span,'' Boysen said. ``At
first she wouldn't try at all. But then she began to show us she
could learn fast.''
