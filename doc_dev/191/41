   Foodmaker Inc.'s net income in its fiscal fourth quarter more than doubled from year-earlier net of $2.1 million, or 20 cents a share, Jack W. Goodall Jr., chairman and president, said. 

   Revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 27 increased to between $146.1 million and $147.4 million from last year's $132.8 million, he said. 

   Mr. Goodall, in an interview, attributed the increase in results to success of three products the company introduced this year at its Jack in the Box fast-food restaurants: the Fajita Pita sandwich, Hot Club Supreme sandwich and Ultimate Cheeseburger. 

   For the year, he said, Foodmaker had about a 50% increase in net, to about $13.8 million, compared with earnings of $9.2 million, or 84 cents a share, earned in fiscal 1986. 
He said revenue for the year increased 7% to 10%, to between $595.5 million and $612.2 million, from the year-earlier $556.5 million. 

   Despite the strong earnings performance, Foodmaker doesn't plan to pay a dividend, Mr. Goodall said. 
Instead, the company will use profit to pay down long-term debt, now totaling $242.7 million, and for capital expansion. 
During fiscal 1988, Foodmaker plans to convert 70 of its 639 company-operated restaurants to franchises, and to build 70 new restaurants that will be operated by the company. 
Jack in the Box franchises now total 259. 

   Jack in the Box's menu has broadened widely from the burger-and-fries staples of the 1950s and 1960s. 

   "Toward the end of the '70s, we could see that McDonald's was winning that race, and we needed to find a new niche," Mr. Goodall said. 
The company has since targeted a more upscale, adult market with its "very adult, eclectic menu." 

   Foodmaker stock began trading publicly in February. 
Jack in the Box operations were purchased in a leveraged buyout from Ralston Purina Co. in September 1985.
