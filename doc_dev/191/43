GAVIN MAXWELL
by Douglas Botting
HarperCollins Pounds 22.50, 585 pages
DO PEOPLE who love animals exceedingly - excessively - have something wrong
with them? My question may seem mischievous, but it is likely to occur to
readers of this superb biography of Gavin Maxwell, 'the otter man' of the
1960s. Crusty old Wilfred Thesiger, that uncompromising Arabian explorer,
who once took Maxwell on a journey to the Marsh Arabs, evidently had his
doubts about his companion: 'Personally I think if people go to extremes
where animals become more important than human beings, then they ought to be
locked up', he opines, recalling what he described as Maxwell's hysterics
over the death of an otter cub they had had for less than a week.
Gavin Maxwell certainly had his problems. He was a grandson of the Duke of
Northumberland, a Percy on his mother's side, with a childhood to guarantee
neuroses ahead. He never knew his father, slept in his doting mother's bed
until he was eight, enjoyed a solitary and idyllic early childhood in the
Scottish Lowlands, was traumatised, according to the pattern, by prep
school, and suffered a serious illness in his teens.
He was thereafter an explorer (on a modest scale), one of the best shots in
Britain, a wartime instructor in the SOE, a shark-hunter off the Highlands,
a society portrait painter - and one of the finest nature writers of this
century. He was homosexual; he drank, and smoked, very heavily; he seems to
have been a manic depressive. He must have had great charm, though he was
also disliked by some people for his arrogant manner. His financial affairs
were undisciplined. He died, of cancer, at 55.
And he loved animals. Douglas Botting's thesis, though he does not insist,
is that he was emotionally atrophied, 'for ever an adolescent in his
attitude to the adult world, his sexual relations and his interests and
enthusiasms'. A male friend describes him as 'two different people - the
respectable public figure (the aristocratic painter, author, ex-Guards
officer and member of learned societies) and the less respectable private
one (the homosexual, the outlaw, the fearful, repressed, inhibited inner
man) . . . The externalisation of his emotional life led to a mistrust of
relationships with adults, so that he only felt safe in the animal world,
the natural world . . . '
This is the world in which he will always be remembered. As Mr Botting puts
it, correctly, 'Gavin Maxwell was to otters what Joy Adamson was to lions,
Dian Fossey to gorillas, Jane Goodall to chimpanzees and Grey Owl to
beavers'. (Which goes some way towards the first sentence of this review.)
He came to otters by accident. After the success of his first book, Harpoon
at a Venture, in which he described the disaster of his post-war attempt to
hunt the Basking Shark in Scottish waters, he went off to the Gulf with
Thesiger where he produced a very fine travel book called A Reed Shaken by
the Wind. There he discovered otters, and brought Mijbil back to his remote
cottage near Mallaig, opposite Skye, soon to be immortalised by him as
'Camusfearna'. Edal and Teko were to follow.
Ring of Bright Water came out in 1960 and was a colossal best-seller. Why?
Partly because it was so well written, partly because it offered escape. It
arrived at the beginning of the 1960s enthusiasm for the Good Life; in more
respectful language, it coincided with a new interest in alternative
life-styles and anticipated what we today call the New Age movement. In
Maxwell's words, 'I am convinced that man has suffered in his separation
from the soil and from other living creatures of the world; the evolution of
his intellect has outrun his needs as an animal . . .'
Hence the popular fascination with the story of a man who goes off to live
on a northern sea-shore in a remote house with no mod. cons., makes best
friends with an otter, and then writes about his fun and games - and
sadnesses - with these simple creatures.
It was never, of course, as simple as it sounded, as Maxwell always
emphasised. The success of the books in itself destroyed the integrity, and
the seclusion, of 'Camusfearna'. And otters were not the only friends. There
was the poet Kathleen Raine, for example, still happily with us today, who
conceived a grand infatuation for the handsome but unresponding Maxwell; she
comes out of this book as a self-regarding witch (and also a very bad poet).
Her obsession with Maxwell is no joke because he half-believed in her
'powers' and when he discovered she had laid a curse on his life he was
ready to believe he had been destroyed. There followed a terrible sequence
of tragedy: the otters turned savage, there were financial disasters,
'Camusfearna' burned to the ground, and in 1969 he died.
Botting, who knew Maxwell for the last 12 years, never forgets that the
books are what matter. After Ring of Bright Water (a line taken from one of
Ms Raine's poems) there were The Rocks Remain and Raven Seek Thy Brother. He
also wrote two excellent books about Sicily, and Lords of the Atlas, a
superior historical study of Morocco, a country he used to visit to indulge
his wilder tastes.
Botting is discreet about the homosexuality and explains that he is
respecting the wishes of the estate. He has the sense to caution that this
might have the effect of exaggerating the importance of the female
relationships, which he feels able to describe more candidly, including a
sad marriage. (There is one wonderful misprint or mishearing where Ms Raine,
in full poetic flood, describes Maxwell as 'the poor Eternus'. As a Jungian,
she presumably said Puer Aeternus.) Throughout a long but never exhausting
book Botting writes beautifully, except for a very occasional tendency to
overreach himself.
He assures us that there are still otters at Sandaig (as 'Camusfearna' is
known on the maps), though the landscape has changed. Apparently the new
bridge to Skye will destroy Kyleakin Island, where Maxwell took refuge for
his last year. All his life he knew that he was in search of Avalon, where
he might hope to heal Tennyson's grievous wound. Perhaps, for just those
first years with the otters, he found it.
