<TEXT>     Although there will be pets for sale, the focus of the show is on pet
education, training and care, said Linda West of the Los Gatos-based company
producing the show. The company plans to make this fair an annual event.;   
"We had talked to over a hundred people about the types of shows they'd like
to see produced," West said. "Pets came up the most often.";    Contests,
including a pet-owner look-alike competition, a top cat contest and a most
talented pet contest will also take place.;    Admission is $6 for adults, $5
for seniors and $4 for children. A portion of the show's proceeds will be
donated to the Humane Society of Santa Clara Valley, Pets-in-Need and the Jane
Goodall Institute.;    For more information, call (408) 354-0700.  </TEXT>
