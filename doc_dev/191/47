MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ANIMAL RIGHTS

The editorial is little more than a mean-spirited tirade directed against 
animal rights activists. Referring to these activists as cranks, and as being 
self-absorbed and vulgar, and as people engaged in self-righteous tantrums is 
uncalled for.

<P>
In the same issue in the View Section there is an article about Jane Goodall, a 
scientist of unquestionable reputation, whose attitude concerning medical 
research on animals is much more reasonable than that presented on the 
Editorial Page. She advocates that more money and research be invested in 
funding alternative research methods and that there be more effective 
supervision to see that the animals in medical laboratories receive the best 
possible treatment.

<P>
Surely there must be ways of discovering medical knowledge other than 
continually torturing so many helpless animals. If there is such a thing as a 
just God, the human species will be punished for its cruel treatment of other 
animals.
