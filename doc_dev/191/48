<LEADPARA>  The chimpanzee that caused a stir when researchers said he understood and
responded to the English language has started communicating about events in
his past.;    Kanzi, a 10-year-old chimp at the Georgia State University
Language Research Center, has made references to past events three times
recently, said research director Sue Savage-Rumbaugh.  </LEADPARA>

SCIENTISTS SAY KANZI THE APE QUESTIONED MOTHER'S
DISAPPEARANCE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Scientists generally thought non-human species deal only in the present.;  
 But Savage-Rumbaugh said she and her husband, Duane Rumbaugh, have proved
that chimps can "recall events and wonder about things that they cannot
understand.";    When Kanzi's mother, Matata, was moved from the research
center, Kanzi, working with a keyboard on which symbols represent words, asked
his handlers, "Matata hide?";    He searched several places, including a spot
where he once found her hiding, and at each location repeated the question.;  
 To allay Kanzi's anxiety, Savage-Rumbaugh made a videotape of Matata and
showed it to him. He jumped, yelled, and demanded to see it again and again.; 
  Finally, he seemed satisfied that his mother was OK, and he calmed down.;   
In April, the Rumbaughs concluded a nine-month study in which they found that
Kanzi, a bonobo chimp, understood and responded to the English language at the
level of a 2-year-old child.;    Duane Rumbaugh said the study was the "first
time in science that there has been really strong data collected under
controlled conditions" that any animal can understand human language.;    In
the study, Kanzi correctly responded to specific requests on 79 percent of 660
test sentences he had never heard before.;    Some scientists lauded the work,
while others said the chimp was merely responding to non-verbal signals from
his handlers.;    The Rumbaughs founded the Language Research Center in 1981.
At the center, chimpanzees provided by Yerkes Center for Primate Research are
studied with a view to defining processes that are basic to first-language
skills.;    The research results are being used to teach children with severe
mental retardation to communicate symbolically with their classmates, teachers
and parents.  </TEXT>
