If Stateside Foods ever becomes grand enough to merit a coat of arms, Roy
Goodall has his Latin motto ready - nunc etiam adsumus, meaning 'we are
still here.'
The English version has been his standard phrase to customers inquiring
after Stateside's corporate health during the past 18 months. It lost Pounds
1.65m during 1990 and 1991, scraped through to break even last year, but is
forecasting Pounds 526,000 profits for 1993 on projected sales of Pounds
5.5m.
The company makes chilled pizzas for half a dozen supermarket chains at its
factory in Haslingden, Lancashire. Checks on its health followed lay-offs, a
withdrawal of overdraft facilities by its bank and a whispering campaign by
some competitors in the UK pizza makers' war for supermarket shelf space.
In the jargon of corporate finance, the company is a bimbo - a
buy-in-management-buyout. In September 1991, Goodall bought into a
management-buyout gone wrong. It needed his expertise as a former
big-company general manager and, before that, a marketing man.
The company had been bought by its management two years before, but
inadequate controls had seen rapid sales growth offset by deepening trading
losses.
Goodall's career had plateaued with middle age. He and his wife decided to
do something on their own and opted for Stateside.
But, as Goodall told a CBI-Grant Thornton north-west regional conference
last month, a nightmare was about to begin. After three months, he upgraded
the quality of its advisers from the 'man and a dog' level his predecessors
had been content with and discovered that the balance sheet had a Pounds
500,000 hole in it.
Over-optimism had led to mis-statements of creditors, debtors, stocks and
assets which the previous auditors had ticked, rather than challenged.
The accounts had looked satisfactory at the time of the buy-in, but it
needed some hands-on experience of Goodall's type to make the realistic
assumptions that would pierce the facade.
As the reality sank in, he realised he was in up to his neck in a bankrupt
company. In the days between Christmas and New Year, he told his bank. The
business was originally founded in the Midlands and the bank was 170 miles
away. He and the manager hardly knew each other. Facilities were immediately
withdrawn. 'I certainly don't blame them,' he says. 'I would have done the
same.'
An interview followed with an insolvency practitioner which made Goodall
feel much better. He was told he was legally obliged to act in the best
interests of Stateside's creditors. Here was a dilemma. Closed down,
Stateside's assets would not fetch enough to pay everyone off, but the
company was by then trading in profit on a day-to-day basis and he believed
its sales forecast was healthy and realistic, with a firm contractual base.
The creditors' best chance of getting their money was for Stateside to carry
on trading - without incurring more debt, as this would have been illegal.
The main creditors took the point and converted what they were owed into
medium-term loans, bolstering the balance sheet and taking pressure off cash
flow.
Sales were factored, so that 80 per cent of revenue was immediately
guaranteed each week and supplies could be bought on a pay-as-you-go basis.
'If you want to see just-in-time practised as an art form, we are it,'
Goodall says.
The payroll had already been slimmed from 80 to 34. He told everyone what
was going on, asked for commitment and co-operation - and Stateside gingerly
started trading its way out of the nightmare.
Confidence grew with sales, and Stateside made an important capital purchase
 -a second-hand burglar alarm, bought for cash, after a spate of pizza
robberies. Next came a Tannoy and music system to bolster morale on the
production line.
By this time last year, suppliers and - encouragingly - would-be suppliers
resumed talking about credit. Sales grew and Stateside achieved a Pounds
200,000 trading profit last year, although this was reduced to break-even,
pre-tax, by finance charges. The company now looks like surviving. Two
prospective buyers have already been turned down. Sales, production and
profits are rising weekly.
Goodall is confident enough to talk about his experience and pass on what he
hopes are the lessons. The 60 company owners and their advisers at the
conference - on why some companies break through to big growth while others
do not - listened spellbound.
Tenacity, commitment and realism were some of his messages. Others concerned
simplicity of vision, hard work, consistent quality of product and making
the best use of people. 'The majority of venture capitalists and bankers
only look at the balance sheet and past performance,' he said.
'The emphasis is on the past, which usually undervalues the business and
most certainly undervalues the people. Surely, sustainable profits and
earnings per share are what really count.'
He stressed the need for good professional advice, even though this might
cost more. Cheap audits cannot be worthwhile if they merely comply with
legal requirements and do not reveal the company is heading towards
bankruptcy.
Advisers should add value, offering constructive criticism to ensure
accounts reflect reality.
