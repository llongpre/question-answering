"Primate Visions" is about the ways in which scientific accounts of the lives 
of animals -- specifically those most closely related to us -- are intertwined 
with our concepts of gender, race, and nature. Depictions of monkeys and apes 
tell us much about ourselves, or, to paraphrase Pogo: "We have met the 
primates, and they are us." Both scientific accounts and popular images of 
monkeys and apes reflect sometimes-disturbing projections of human problems. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway precedes from the assumption that monkeys and apes occupy the crucial 
border zone between culture and nature; in the book we see them catapulted into 
space, taught to communicate with humans, or portrayed as symbols of "lost 
innocence" in a Third World devoid of indigenous human actors. In this 
mythological terrain, a lone white girl named Jane meets the innocent ape and 
both are transfigured. Through Haraway's lens, we see that the National 
Geographic vision of Africa bears a stronger resemblance to Disney World than 
to the African reality -- it is a theme park of the late 20th-Century 
industrial West's imagination.

Haraway is chairman of the history of consciousness program at UC Santa Cruz, 
and a leading figure in post-modern deconstructionism. "Primate Visions" is 
about the way in which scientific accounts reflect and create our natural 
cosmology. Haraway is at her best when she monkeys brilliantly with some of our 
most precious symbols, at her worst when her language is inaccessible to a 
layperson not steeped in post-modern criticism. This is an important book that 
deserves the widest possible audience. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the book historically contextualizes the modern view of 
primates. In a chapter entitled "Teddy Bear Patriarchy" we are led through the 
great halls of the American Museum of Natural History. Here, Teddy Roosevelt's 
patriarchal ideals of manhood are reflected in the African Hall dioramas in 
which stuffed animals are mounted in family groupings to symbolize the "purity 
of nature." African Hall was the work of Carl Akeley, the artist, scientist and 
hunter who collected and stuffed African animals beginning in the 1880s. "From 
the dead body of the primate Akeley crafted something finer than the living 
organism; he achieved its true end, a new genesis. Decadence -- the threat of 
the city, civilization, machine -- was stayed in the politics of eugenics and 
the art of taxidermy." 
</P>
<P>
The magnificent silverback male gorilla of which Haraway writes, was killed in 
1921, the same year the museum hosted a large international gathering of 
eugenicists. She connects the vision in the dioramas to the obsession with 
"genetic hygiene" of many early 20th-Century Americans and Europeans. Like the 
dioramas, eugenics contrasted the woes of civilization with the goodness of 
nature. By showing us African Hall as "simultaneously a very strange place and 
an ordinary experience for literally millions of North Americans" Haraway 
points out how strange our ordinary reality is. No one who has read "Teddy Bear 
Patriarchy" will ever experience a trip to the Museum of Natural History in 
quite the same way as before. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway devotes later chapters to modern primate field and laboratory studies. 
She connects the portrayals of white women watching apes in the Third World to 
First World anxieties about African decolonization. We read what is left out of 
the National Geographic accounts: Jane Goodall and her mother making 2,000 Spam 
sandwiches for Belgian troops fleeing their former colony; a cage constructed 
for Goodall's son, to protect him from the chimpanzees. National Geographic 
omits the African political context in which Goodall's work took place. 
</P>
<P>
In a final section of the book, Haraway presents biographies of four modern 
primatologists -- all of them women. It is probably not coincidental that 
primatology is the only branch of evolutionary studies with a predominance of 
successful women practitioners. Women are identified with nature and figure 
importantly in the mythological construction of the primate Garden of Eden. 
Women primatologists have contested male-centered origin stories by placing 
female monkeys and apes center stage in their accounts, and emphasizing female 
primate agency. 
</P>
<P>
Because Haraway is interested in reading primatology as text, she avoids 
questions about what is scientific fact versus poorly supported theoretical 
speculation. One primatologist whose work Haraway discusses is a leading 
proponent of sociobiology (the theory that animals and humans follow strategies 
that insure that the greatest number of their own genes will survive in future 
generations). The primatologist speaks of female monkeys, apes and humans as 
competitive, assertive, dominance- oriented and looking out for their own 
genetic advantage. It seems that female primates of the 1980s have taken their 
places in the board room of primate troops that resemble corporate culture. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway points out the ways in which this new image of female primates mirrors 
late 20th-Century capitalist society. But sociobiology has been criticized for 
its failure to document actual behavior across the primate life cycle. Because 
a researcher seems to tell a good "feminist" story (i.e. that female primates 
are strategists for their own genetic advantage) does not mean that the work is 
good science. Sociobiology is genetic reductionism. It implies that gendered 
behaviors are controlled by genes. There is much evidence that this is not the 
case for humans, apes or monkeys. While all scientific stories may be read as 
myth, some are also poor science. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging and engaging, "Primate Visions" holds up a mirror to some of our 
favorite myths about animals. It shows us that we are not innocent; a Sunday at 
the museum or an evening in front of television are laden with meanings and 
deep ambiguities at the heart of our ideas about human and animal.
