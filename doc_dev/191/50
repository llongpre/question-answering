IN SPITE of a substantial contraction in interest charges, pre-tax profits
at Hopkinsons Holdings, the industrial abrasives, plastic products and gas
control equipment group, showed another sharp decline over the six months to
July 31.
According to Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, the outcome, as anticipated, was
equal to the second half of the previous year at Pounds 722,000 (Pounds
1.34m).
Although Carborundum Abrasives returned to profit, Bryan Donkin Engineering,
still hit by uncertainty over the capital spending plans of British Gas, its
biggest customer, suffered a further decline in orders. Activities in
Germany continued to be affected by recession and the strong D-Mark, which
placed further pressure on sales and margins.
Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 51.7m (Pounds 51.3m); Mr Goodall said
that the comparison was flattered by exchange rate movements which disguised
a real decline of 6.5 per cent.
Borrowings were reduced by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 11.4m by end-July and by a
further Pounds 2.5m since then; gearing currently stands at 28 per cent (41
per cent).
After a nil tax charge, reflecting German losses and the release of tax
provisions, earnings per share emerged at 0.91p (0.89p). The interim
dividend is 0.5p (0.9p) but Mr Goodall said the intention was to maintain
the total at last year's 1.3p.
