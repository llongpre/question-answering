   As a youngster, she wanted to be Jane Goodall
when she grew up. Or maybe a park ranger, zoo keeper or horse
trainer. Like her husband, she wound up as a schoolteacher, but not
for long. Genny and Lee Barhaugh figure they have the ideal job,
running a dude ranch in the wilds of Montana.

   Genny Barhaugh was a proper Massachusetts
preppie in her teen years, studying hard with hopes of going on to
Radcliffe. Today, she's an experienced wrangler and ranch cook, and
unofficial arm-wrestling champion of Great Falls.
   She feels she has the best job in the world.
   Genny and her husband, Lee, both 33 and both former
schoolteachers, manage the Pine Butte Guest Ranch, a small
non-profit dude ranch owned by The Nature Conservancy and
surrounded by wilderness _ 18,000 acres managed by the conservancy
and an additional 1,009,356 acres in the Bob Marshall Wilderness
Preserve.
   It's the largest wild expanse in the contiguous 48 states, and
the Pine Butte Swamp, technically a fen, is the largest wetland
complex along the eastern slope of the Rockies and one of the last
strongholds of the grizzly bear.
   It's also home to bobcats, mountain lions, wolverines, badgers,
foxes, coyotes and deer, virtually every mammal native to Montana,
as well as hundreds of species of birds, falcons, eagles and hawks.
   The winters are bleak as the chinooks, Indian for snow eaters,
howl outside for days on end. The winds, which are warm, melt the
snow and may bring the temperature up by 30 to 40 degrees in a
given day. Everything adapts. The pine trees are called limber pine
because they give with the wind, but all are stunted and twisted
from its constancy.
   Genny and Lee don't really get a day off from May 1 until Nov.
1. They spend their Sundays hauling guests to and from the Great
Falls Airport, a 90-minute drive. The rest of the week Genny is up
at 6 a.m. to oversee the cooking of breakfast. She doesn't get back
to her home until 8 or 8:30 p.m.
   The ranch accommodates up to 25 guests in nine rustic cabins,
each with fireplace, private bath and handmade furniture. In
season, the $595 per person per week includes airport
transportation, three family-style meals a day, with homemade
breads and fresh vegetables bought from a nearby Hutterite
community.
   Two trail rides a day and a variety of naturalist programs are
also included. For the hardy, there are treks led by a naturalist
to sites of dinosaur eggs, down into a fen, up to a beaver pond,
high on to hills, off to a swamp where birders can see up to 130
species. Each evening a naturalist gives a talk or a slide show in
the main lodge.
   or the less athletic, there is a heated swimming pool, a center
with a few fossils, and some nice easy trails to wander alone
through the aspen, cottonwood and firs.
   After Labor Day, the horses are gone and the price drops to $450
a week.
   Genny is paid $12,000 a year, her husband $16,000.
   ``We're obviously not in this for the money,'' she jokes.
   She spent last winter sending out brochures and getting the
cabins booked for the summer.
   In the winter, the chinooks, which can blow up to 70 mph,
sometimes keep her cabin-bound for up to five days.
   ``I feel the elements are making some kind of statement,'' she
says. ``I feel the winds are saying this is supposed to be a wild
place. I feel that maybe I shouldn't be here.
   ``I get depressed, but when it's over and I'm outside again, I'm
fine.''
   Genny, who was disillusioned as a teacher by the students' lack
of motivation and discipline problems, says, ``I feel like I have a
very wide mix of skills and here I'm using them to the best of my
ability.''
   As a youngster, Genny wanted to be Jane Goodall when she grew
up. Or maybe a park ranger, zoo keeper or horse trainer.
   ``It was all rather nebulous, but I somehow knew I wanted to be
involved with animals,'' she says. ``But it was a family tradition
to go to prep school.'' So the native of St. Clair, Mich., daughter
of a salt company executive, was sent to Abbot, a Massachusetts
prep school now absorbed by Andover.
   ``I really studied hard but then I realized my dream was not in
the East,'' she says.
   So she headed West and the preppie became a head wrangler, a
ranch hand who chopped and hauled wood with the men, a ranch cook,
a schoolteacher, a journalist.
   On one of her previous jobs, where she was head cook for 100
people, there was a grizzly with two cubs very close to the camp.
Genny had to walk 150 yards in the darkness to get breakfast going.
   ``There were a couple of Saint Bernards at the camp and I always
took one of them with me,'' she says. ``Not that he would have done
much good, but he made me feel better.
   ``Lee and I had great dreams of someday getting our own guest
ranch, but we didn't know where we would get that much capital.
Then we heard The Nature Conservancy was looking and it sounded
like such a dream we couldn't let it go.''
   They got the job, sold their house, and Genny moved out to the
ranch with her infant daughter, Laney. Lee, a high school teacher,
had to finish the school term.
   Laney is now an energetic 2-year-old with no qualms about
climbing aboard a horse with her mother.
   Lee, a native of Casper, Wyo., is not the equestrian his wife
is. Genny, who has owned her own horse off and on since she was in
the sixth-grade, has competed in riding competitions.
   Jenny spent one year at the University of Oregon, dropped out to
tour the West with two friends in a Volkswagen, then got two
degrees, one in zoology from the University of Montana, and one in
English from Montana State.
   Jenny laughs at the female arm-wrestling title, announced by her
boastful husband.
   ``It's really unofficial,'' she says. ``I pride myself on being
strong, but this was at a party. All the women began arm wrestling
and I won. It may also have something to do with the fact that I
was the only sober person at the party.''
