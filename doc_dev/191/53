   The man who saved a Detroit Zoo
chimpanzee from drowning said he never feared for his own life as
he wrestled the 135-pound primate.
   ``He was looking at me,'' said Rick Swope, a 33-year-old truck
driver from Cement City. ``I think he knew that I was helping
him,'' so Swope said he wasn't afraid.
   Swope was visiting the zoo Sunday with his wife, Cynthia, and
their three children.
   ``We watched the chimpanzees for probably about half an hour or
so and we were just getting ready to go when I heard a splash,'' he
said. ``I just caught out of the corner of my eye this chimpanzee
flying through the air.''
   ``Everyone in the whole place was just standing around watching
this monkey drown,'' Swope said Monday. ``When he went down the
second time I knew I had to do something.''
   Swope scaled the 4-foot fence and plunged into the cold, murky
water. He reached the chimpanzee and pulled it back to the island.
   ``He was pretty lifeless,'' Swope said. ``When I brought him out
of there I wasn't sure he was still alive.''
   Zoo officials are unsure why the 18-year-old, 135-pound male
chimpanzee jumped into the moat surrounding its 1-acre island home,
said spokeswoman Pat Butkiewicz. Chimpanzees cannot swim and
generally are afraid of water.
   In April, a week after the $7.5 million exhibit opened, a
20-year-old female chimp drowned in the 5-foot-deep moat.
   Zoo director Steve Graham said the exhibit would be partially
closed while the design of the moat was being re-evaluated.
   Graham said Swope's rescue was brave but reckless, because
chimps are three to five times stronger than humans. A zoo employee
was trying to use a pole to save the chimp when Swope jumped in the
water, officials said.
   Swope, who doesn't have any lifeguard or veterinary training,
said he kept one arm around the chimp's stomach during the rescue.
   ``I thought maybe I could pump some water out of him,'' he said.
``When he got his strength back, I let him go.''
   Swope's family each year visits the suburban Detroit zoo about
75 miles northwest of their home. He said chimpanzee exhibit is one
of his children's favorites.
   ``They're happy it turned out the way it did, too. They're glad
I went in and got him,'' he said. ``They wouldn't expect anything
less from their dad.''
