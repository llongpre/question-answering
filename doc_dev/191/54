FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Scapa

ACQUISITIONS helped Scapa Group, which supplies industrial textiles and
services to the paper industry, increase annual pre-tax profits by 5 per
cent from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 47m.
The Blackburn-based group, which makes 66 per cent of its sales outside the
UK, yesterday also announced a management succession and an enhanced scrip
dividend scheme.
Mr Bill Goodall will step down in October after seven years as chairman, on
reaching the group retirement age of 62.
He will be succeeded as executive chairman by Mr Harry Tuley, 59, the
present chief executive.
Mr David Dunn who has been finance director since 1987, will become group
managing director, and a new finance director will be announced shortly.
Turnover rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 347m (Pounds 300m) in the year to
March 31. Sterling's devaluation boosted the sales figure by Pounds 5m and
profits by Pounds 500,000.
Scapa said trading conditions remained difficult for its industrial
customers, but the group had managed to increase market share - particularly
in engineered fabrics.
In engineered rolls, servicing and repair activities had grown at a time
when the absence of new paper machines had reduced business available from
machine builders.
The industrial materials division had shown strong progress, with the start
of recovery in the filter fabric business and a good performance from
industrial textiles and wirecloth for filter screening and industrial
applications.
The companies providing technical adhesive tapes had grown substantially,
both organically in the UK and by acquisition in Europe.
Mr Goodall said: 'The strength of progress now being made endorses further
the board's view that the industrial materials division has the capability
to play a much weightier part of Scapa's future development.'
Earnings rose to 13.8p (13.2p). A final dividend of 4.03p raises the total
to 5.63p (5.36p). However, shareholders can elect to take scrip to the value
of 6.045p, an increase of 50 per cent over the final cash dividend.
For shareholders who want cash, BZW will buy the enhanced scrip at a minimum
of 98 per cent of its value, equivalent to 5.924p. The retained cash and
related advance corporation tax saving of up to Pounds 11.8m would be used
to exploit profitable growth opportunities.
Mr Goodall said: 'With any improvements in underlying economic conditions we
can expect the group to do well and make faster progress.'
COMMENT
These were a solid set of results to mark Mr Goodall's departure, and the
management succession looks well-planned. Scapa is continuing to find it
hard going in the paper industry, but by increasing market share has
positioned itself well for any upturn. More interesting is the management's
confidence that its investment in filtration and other industrial materials
businesses is finally coming good, and offers scope for further
acquisitions. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 55m would put the shares,
up 2p at 225p, on a prospective multiple of 14.5. That does not seem
expensive for a group which last year earned 78 per cent of its profits from
the UK and US.
