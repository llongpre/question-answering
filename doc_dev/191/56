Killing 2,000 goats on Santa Catalina is a very logical act. The balance of 
nature is necessary for the survival of all things. 
</P>
<P>
When an "unbalanced" situation occurs -- too many goats -- how divine of 
mankind to step in and set it straight. 
</P>
<P>
Using this same logic, we will notice the other "unbalanced" situation that is 
going on -- too many people -- and thus proceed in the same fashion. (Pity that 
the goats can't pull the trigger.) By reducing world population by 50%, I am 
certain that the "native grasses, shrubs and animals -- such as fox -- will be 
able to thrive." As Jane Goodall mentioned, it is "the arrogance of mankind" 
that uses one form of logic for animals and another for the human race.
