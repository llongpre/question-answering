   The judge in the Iran-Contra case ordered four
separate trials Wednesday to allow Oliver North and three
co-defendants to use each others' immunized congressional testimony
to defend against the charges.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell gave independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh until Friday to decide whether to proceed first
with a trial of North on 16 charges or to try former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter on seven counts.
   The judge said arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim
could be tried individually after North and Poindexter go to trial
separately on charges they conspired to defraud the government by
illegally diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush are starting
to get serious about choosing running mates, with Dukakis facing an
increasingly insistent Jesse Jackson who says he has earned
consideration for the job and ``consideration means an offer.''
   Dukakis quickly rejected that notion on Wednesday.
   ``I don't think anyone is due an offer. But there are a great
many people that are going to be considered and he'll be one of
them,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   Dukakis locked up the Democratic presidential nomination in
Tuesday's final primaries, setting up his fall matchup with Bush,
who has had the GOP nomination in hand since late April.

   Primaries in seven states cleared the way for
multimillion-dollar Senate battles in New Jersey and California,
and Republicans said Wednesday the results also bolstered their
hopes of ousting Sens. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and John Melcher
of Montana.
   In California, voters rejected propositions authorizing an AIDS
quarantine, closing the Rancho Seco nuclear plant, dividing mammoth
San Bernardino County in two and relaxing state spending limits
imposed after tax-slashing Proposition 13 was passed a decade ago.
   Tuesday's ballots also included one race for governor and one
for mayor. In Montana, former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge captured
the nomination to succeed retiring Democrat Ted Schwinden, scoring
39 percent of the vote in a six-man race. He will face Republican
former state Sen. Stan Stephens. In San Diego, Mayor Maureen
O'Connor was elected to a full four-year term with 58 percent of
the vote.

   President Reagan played down any disagreement
Wednesday with Vice President George Bush about the Soviet Union,
but underscored his belief that Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
``definitely wants changes in the social structure there.''
   Bush a day earlier offered a different view.
   ``I don't agree that we know enough to say that there is that
kind of fundamental change, a turning inward, a la China, on the
part of the Soviet Union. I don't feel that way,'' the vice
president said Tuesday. He said Gorbachev was ``stylistically
different, obviously generationally different'' but ``my view is
the jury is still out'' on his intentions.
   Reagan was asked about the apparent difference with Bush during
a White House question-and-answer session with reporters from
around the country.
   Denying he was on a different track than the vice president, the
president said, ``I think he's being as careful, as we all must
be.''

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on Wednesday invited the United States to join the
Soviet Union in banning all nuclear tests as part of a sweeping new
disarmament proposal.
   Speaking to the U.N. special session on disarmament,
Shevardnadze said the goal was ``a step-by-step elimination of
nuclear weapons by the year 2000.''
   He also called for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the Warsaw Pact to each reduce their forces by 500,000 troops.
   For the first time, Shevardnadze declared that the Soviet Union
would announce the presence or absence of nuclear weapons on naval
ships on foreign port calls if the United States and Western allies
do the same.
   The United States has consistently refused to confirm or deny
whether its ships are nuclear-powered or carry nuclear weapons.

   U.S. authorities on Wednesday
displayed for the first time some of the 859 U.S. medium-range
nuclear missiles to be destroyed under the superpower arms accord
put into effect at the Moscow summit.
   Reporters, including some from the Soviet Union and other East
bloc nations, viewed missiles or missile-firing equipment at four
of the 12 sites in Western Europe covered by the missile agreement.
   Soviet officials are due to begin inspecting the missile bases,
plus 14 sites in the United States, as early as July 1. U.S.
inspectors have a reciprocal right to check 133 sites, including
126 in the Soviet Union, six in East Germany and one in
Czechoslovakia.

   Blacks ended their largest,
longest general strike Wednesday and organizers declared it a
victory over government suppression of anti-apartheid groups.
   More than two million workers and students participated in the
three-day protest, which employers said cost the economy $250
million. At least 10 people were killed, 38 wounded or injured and
36 arrested, and many commuter buses and trains were attacked.
   Black labor federations, supported by prominent clergymen,
organized the protest to express opposition to restrictions put on
anti-apartheid groups Feb. 24 and proposed legislation that would
limit the rights of unions to strike.

   Authorities on Wednesday freed nearly 200
inmates from overcrowded city jails and prepared to release more to
meet a federal court order, but police said they would keep
arresting criminals.
   ``I don't know if we'll get them all out by today,'' said City
Solicitor Seymour Kurland. ``They have to be checked out to make
sure that we're not letting anyone out that has any kind of violent
background.''
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the city Tuesday
to comply with a ruling restricting the prison population to 3,750
inmates, 259 less than the number held as of Monday.

   Officials canceled final exams and
graduation for the senior class at Fairview High School, saying
they feared a group of students had planned to commit suicide or
other violence during ceremonies.
   ``It's more than just pranks,'' Frank Kroto, Fairview School
District solicitor, said Wednesday. ``It's more than the typical
end of the year dissatisfaction with authority.''
   Kroto also said several school administrators received personal
threats and were being protected by police. He did not give
details, but state police said troopers were patrolling near some
administrators' homes, as if they asked for patrols while on
vacation.

   The Reagan administration is considering
expanding its ``zero tolerance'' war on drug users with the
threatened loss of student loans, drivers' licenses and public
housing, administration sources said Wednesday.
   The Cabinet-level National Drug Policy Board is considering
whether to endorse withholding federal aid from state and local
governments, colleges and universities and other publicly financed
institutions if they don't adopt the anti-drug proposals, which are
still in the discussion stage. Attorney General Edwin Meese III
chairs the policy board.
   Education Secretary William Bennett is trying to steer the
Reagan administration away from the proposals.

   Frustrated by a ban on importing chimpanzees,
U.S. officials are looking into shifting AIDS tests on the animals
to Africa and the Soviet Union, a move experts call a needless
death blow to the last chimps in the wild.
   ``This is very, very bad,'' said Jane Goodall, a leading
chimpanzee specialist who was recently in Washington to alert
legislators to the unannounced program. ``It is not a choice of
AIDS or chimps. Enough can be bred in captivity.''
   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., a veterinarian, has threatened to
block such a move.
   The director of the National Institutes of Health, James
Wyngaarden, confirmed in an interview that the government agency is
considering AIDS research projects in Africa and the Soviet Union
because U.S. law bans importation of chimpanzees.

   Police thwarted a student march and pro-democracy
rally planned for Beijing's huge main square Wednesday and
dispersed a dozen students who gathered nearby to complain. Armed
officers ringed the square until 11 p.m.
   Nearly 1,000 students rallied late into the night on the Beijing
University campus 10 miles away, but speakers urged them to press
their demands through ``proper channels.'' No plans were made to
try the march another day.
   ``I wouldn't join a demonstration. Now isn't the time,'' said
one student. Another declared: ``Quite frankly, we are afraid.''

   A Navy recruit described as being
literally scared to death when allegedly forced back into a rescue
training pool died by accident because ``the system broke down,''
defense lawyers argued Wednesday.
   A prosecutor, however, contended that forcing Airman Recruit Lee
Mirecki into the pool when he tried to quit the rescue course at
Pensacola Naval Air Station couldn't be blamed on the system, but
was a crime committed by people.
   ``The use of force to make people do things is not allowed by
the Uniform Code'' of Military Justice, said Lt. Cmdr. Larry D.
Wynne.
   The arguments closed a hearing into the March 2 death of the
19-year-old recruit from Appleton, Wis., at the Pensacola Naval Air
Station.
