Pounds 7.3m

VOLEX GROUP, the electrical interconnection products company whose chief
executive was headhunted by Farnell Electronics in May, doubled profits in
the year to March 31.
The shares rose 18p to 405p.
The rise from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 7.34m was struck on turnover up from
Pounds 81.6m to Pounds 106.1m. Mr Ken Hooper, finance director, said it was
difficult to say how much of the advance was organic growth and how much
derived from acquisitions because of the way the new companies had been
woven into the group. However, Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, said that the
result contained a 'good amount' of organic progress.
During the year, Volex spent Pounds 8.5m on acquisitions. It added Icontec
in July 1992 and Component Manufacturing Systems in January 1993 to its
Cable Products operation in the US.
In October 1992 it also bought a 60 per cent stake in Mayor, the
Singapore-based maker of data and power cord assemblies.
Guided by Mr Howard Poulson, the outgoing chief executive described by Mr
Goodall as 'a good strategic thinker', Volex has become a worldwide supplier
of cable assemblies to the computer, medical and instrumentation markets.
Mr Goodall said this global strategy was a lesson learned from the wiring
systems side, which supplies the automotive industry. Here Volex has
withdrawn from supplying volume car manufacturers - which opted for global
suppliers - and has instead targeted markets such as off-road and
agricultural vehicles, sports and specialist cars, Rolls-Royce and Aston
Martin. The division is being restructured and the St Helens factory was
closed. There was also a Pounds 654,000 bad debt provision from Leyland DAF
taken as an exceptional charge.
Some 40 per cent of the growth at Pencon, the UK maker of power cords, was
organic, the company said, and Pounds 3m of the group's Pounds 7.8m capital
expenditure allowed capacity to be increased. Legislation for the
pre-fitting of plugs to electrical appliances is expected this year.
January's Pounds 17.5m rights issue helped increase shareholders' funds to
Pounds 38.7m (Pounds 29.5m) and at the year-end, Volex had net positive
funds of Pounds 5.9m. The final dividend is lifted to 11.35p for a 17.85p
(17p) total, payable from earnings of 22.5p (14.9p) per share.
