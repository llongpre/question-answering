Rapture seems an unlikely term with which to associate the majority of the 
venal, weak, self-centered characters in David Hare's "The Secret Rapture" at 
South Coast Repertory. The word is not used in the scuba diving sense, as in 
rapture of the deep, although spiritual euphoria is part of the mystery Hare 
attempts to evoke. As he explains it, "The 'secret rapture' is that moment at 
which a nun expects to be united with Christ. In other words, it's death." 
</P>
<P>
If that sends a shiver through you, it should. A kind of chill stalks "The 
Secret Rapture" from the moment light slices through blackout as a woman 
nervously opens a door and is startled to find her sister sitting in the dark 
room. Their father has died; his body is on the bed. Lives will be changed, not 
by the event of death, which is only a trigger, but by the forces of 
interpersonal and public politics that will rush in to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
Hare has not made a secret of his fascination with how larger societal forces 
shape our private ends. He tackled that notion in "Plenty," a psychological 
dissection of post-World War II England seen through the collapse of one woman. 
In "Rapture," he has taken the fallout of Thatcherism and created an unlikely 
morality play through the secular canonization of another. 
</P>
<P>
Of the sisters mentioned earlier, Marion (Bairbre Dowling) is a junior minister 
in a hidebound conservative government while Isobel (Caroline Goodall) is an 
artist. They have only one thing in common: their late father's widow, 
Katherine (Libby Boone), a much younger woman, alcoholic and incapable of 
coping responsibly. She becomes their unequally shared responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Isobel loves, lives and works with Irwin (Simon Templeman), another artist with 
whom she ekes out a contented living. She is interior, tender, idealistic. 
Marion is exterior, self-righteous and, by her own eventual admission, 
incapable of feeling ("I don't have the right equipment"). She is married to 
Tom (Hal Landon Jr.), a born milquetoast and born-again Baptist who heads 
something called Christians in Business. 
</P>
<P>
The road to destruction is subtle, even if Hare's play isn't always. First 
Marion allows Katherine to inflict herself on Isobel. Later Marion and Tom in a 
"Christian" desire to "help," bedevil Isobel's and Irwin's life with 
self-serving temptations that alter chemistries and wreak ultimate chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The play, which achieves this with uneven success, ends with a tortured 
epiphany that won't bear repeating. "Secret Rapture" is not about plot or 
cause, but about effect. It's about the malice of weakness and the 
powerlessness of strength. It's about currents and resistance, humanity and 
honor. In short, it is dangerous, difficult stuff. After such plays as 
"Speed-the-Plow," "Serious Money," "Glengarry Glen Ross," "Palladium Is Moving" 
and even "Other People's Money," "The Secret Rapture" is, as Hare himself 
recognizes, an attempt "to buck the trend. Unfashionably," says he, "I have a 
heroine."

And then some. Under David Emmes' spare and precise direction, the production 
at SCR is a part of Orange County's ongoing Festival of Britain. The design 
team and the cast are a hands-across-the-sea mixer, with the excellent Goodall 
and Templeman hailing from England, along with set designer Robert Jones, whose 
supply of ever-changing, meticulously detailed locales would seem to defy the 
logistics of storage and wing space. 
</P>
<P>
Boone is a vibrant manic-depressive as Katherine, and Dowling's Marion is 
shrill and obnoxious enough in her tailored suits to conjure up the inevitable 
associations. Elizabeth Dennehy provides some entertaining man-eating moments 
as her shallow assistant Rhonda, while Landon's apologetic piety and limpness 
seem a loaded act of perpetual self-erasure. But the play pivots around the 
complex Isobel and, only because he is so inextricably the instrument of her 
fate, around Irwin. Templeman manages to embody weakness with plenty of 
presence, while Goodall's generous and inviting Isobel thoroughly eludes 
self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
This is a play destined to arouse polemics, but it is curious to recall that it 
did so earlier this year for the wrong reasons, when Hare challenged New York 
Times critic Frank Rich to a duel of words after Rich reacted negatively to the 
New York production Hare had directed. Rich declined, but the furor persisted 
-- unfortunately so. The play deserves to be talked about not for its Rich 
review, but for the richness of its content.
