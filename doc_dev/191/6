   Undersea explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau said
Thursday the six children he took along on his recent mission to
Antarctica sometimes had a sweet view of what constitutes a good
time.
   During one jampacked day when the group went to see colonies of
penguins, seals and other creatures from the ice continent, they
stopped at a Polish research station on the way back to their ship.
   Cousteau said when he asked one of the children if he'd had a
good day, the child replied: ``Oh, it was great. They gave us
cookies at the Polish station.''
   Cousteau left Jan. 3 from Chile for Antarctica with one child
from each of the six other continents. The children, ages 11 and
12, returned to Chile on Sunday.
   The mission was meant to symbolize that ``Antarctica belongs to
future generations, not to us,'' he said.
   The Cousteau Society has joined an international initiative
sponsored by the French and Australian governments to declare
Antarctica a ``natural reserve and land of science'' and ban mining
or other industrial activities.
   Cousteau said they built an igloo _ ``a symbolic home'' _ while
there and some group members slept one night in it.
   ``The next morning we brought them a big thermos of hot
chocolate and cakes,'' he said. ``They were happy like clams.''

   Mick Jagger said ``any day now'' he'd marry Jerry
Hall. That was back in 1983, but Hall said Thursday she and the
Rolling Stone now both think it's a fine idea after two kids and 12
years together.
   ``For the first time, we both think marriage is a good thing,''
Ms. Hall told reporters at the Lyric Theater, where she will be
starring in ``Bus Stop,'' with singer Shaun Cassidy.
   The Texas-born model and actress refused to confirm that her
large diamond ring was an engagement present from the rock singer,
who is in the Caribbean.
   ``He gives me a ring like this about once a year,'' she said.
   Hall and Jagger have two children: Elizabeth Scarlett, 5, and
Leroy Augustine, 3.
   Ms. Hall appeared in ``Bus Stop'' in 1988 in New Jersey, and the
British production will open next week in suburban Watford before
moving to London in February.

   Jane Goodall, who pioneered the study of
primates in the wild, is joining the University of Southern
California faculty.
   The British ethnologist will give occasional lectures and
seminars as Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Anthropology and
Occupational Science, the university said Thursday.
   She also will take graduate students into her various programs
worldwide. Ms. Goodall, 56, who gained international acclaim during
30 years of research in Tanzania and for her close-contact studies
of wild chimpanzees, will bring the university the most
comprehensive records of animal behavior ever compiled.
   The materials represent ``really one of the most important
ethnographic resources in the world,'' USC anthropologist Gary
Seaman said.
   The facilities offered to organize her research materials was an
important factor in her decision to join USC, Ms. Goodall said.
   She was born in London and lives in Tanzania. In the early 1970s
she was a visiting professor at Stanford and served as curator of
mammals at the California Academy of Sciences from 1985 to 1987.

   Dethroned hotel queen Leona Helmsley is
free pending appeal of a four-year sentence for tax evasion, but
that didn't stop reporters from touring a prison she might get sent
to if she does have to serve time.
   Khaki-clad inmates waved at cameras and shouted advice Wednesday
for the woman who could end up their neighbor in the low- to
medium-security Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury.
   ``You're going to get a new life here,'' shouted one of the 165
female inmates. There are also about 1,100 men in the prison.
   ``It's a nice camp. No bars, no guns and she would have her
privacy and be treated as all other inmates,'' said Sylvia Jenkins,
52.
   Another inmate, Cora Cressey, 65, said the place was more like
boot camp.
   Prison officials stressed that no final decision has been made
on where Helmsley would be imprisoned if her appeal fails.
   Helmsley, convicted on 33 counts of income tax evasion, was
sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million.

   Actor Don Johnson has asked a judge to throw
out a lawsuit charging that he encouraged an employee to fire
birdshot at a helicopter flying over his ranch on his wedding day.
   Johnson also filed a countersuit charging that Star magazine and
pilot Burt Metcalf of Montrose invaded their privacy, were flying
illegally and recklessly disregarded the safety of Johnson, his
bride, actress Melanie Griffith and their guests.
   Johnson asked that the court absolve him of liability and force
the plaintiffs to pay legal fees.
   Star, reporter Barry Levine and Metcalf sued in November,
alleging that Johnson encouraged bodyguard Greg Isaacs to fire
birdshot.

   Actress Loretta Swit will help raise money for a
new play area for five ``talking'' chimpanzees, which researchers
at Central Washington University say are the first non-humans to
learn sign language.
   Swit and Gov. Booth Gardner were scheduled hosts for a $150 per
plate fund-raiser Thursday night, which was to include wild
chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall.
   The effort is for the Washoe Project at the campus in
Ellensburg, about 125 miles to the east.
   Washoe is the pioneering chimp who was the first animal ever to
learn a human language, said researcher Roger Fouts.
   The Legislature approved $1.5 million to build the chimpanzees a
new home. They had been living on the third floor of a university
building. But lawmakers didn't include money for a recreation area.
   ``Washoe hasn't seen the sun in 10 years,'' Fouts said.
