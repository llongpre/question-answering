   It's springtime on Martha's Vineyard and
the locals are girding for what's become an annual influx of
arrogant, offensive pests who walk the streets at night and hang
out at restaurants.
   It's not tourists. It's skunks.
   Hordes of the ``black cats with white tails'' have inhabited the
island, taking up residence under houses, rummaging through
restaurant garbage, intimidating vacationers, terrorizing pets and,
frankly, stinking up the place.
   ``They're really bold and brassy. You can see them on the main
streets, you can see them walking around anywhere,'' said Diane
Goodale, animal control officer for the Vineyard Haven section of
town. ``If you're fishing at night, they'll just come right up to
you.''
   Dead fish along the shore, ground nesting birds and plenty of
woods make the island an ideal habitat for skunks. And state
wildlife officials and animal control officers in the island's six
towns say their telephones don't stop ringing in the springtime
when baby skunks are born and the warm weather makes the beasts
more active.
   Fin Miller was the man many residents hired from 1982 until his
retirement in 1987 to rid their property of the raccoons, skunks
and feral cats that were giving them headaches.
   During that five-year period, he said, he trapped nearly 500
skunks. Another trapper was said to have caught about 300 a year
during the period.
   ``I found they're partial to Devil Dogs and Twinkies. People
used to call it junk food but I used to call it skunk food,''
Miller said. ``I could catch a skunk on any place, except the
Presbyterian church steeple. They haven't gotten up there yet.''
   Many islanders swear that, at least since Colonial times, no
skunks were on the island before the late 1950s. How they returned
to Martha's Vineyard is a touchy matter involving old allegations
that have flourished into local lore.
   Legend has it that the skunk population was revived when
Vineyard Haven native Craig Kingsbury brought two unscented skunks
_ one male and one female _ and set them free to roam with the
oxen, cattle and goats on his farm some 30 years ago.
   Kingsbury, 77, swears it's not true.
   He blames vacationers for bringing baby skunks and raccoons over
as pets and abandoning them on the island when the cuddly critters
got big and nasty. The old farmer said he was accused by his
neighbors because a family of abandoned skunks took up residence on
his property.
   ``The skunks moved in on my farm and I didn't bother them, kill
them, or have a fit over them. I just left them alone,'' he said,
and laughed at the typical city vacationer's fear of wildlife.
``Anything bigger than a field mouse puts them in a trauma.''
   But the rumors persist.
   ``For some reason there's always a dead skunk in front of his
house. If you don't see them, you can smell them,'' Goodale said.
   The 100-square-mile island has few predators to control the
skunk population.
   ``They only have one natural enemy, and that has four wheels,''
said Peter Kazlauskas, operations manager of the island's trash
disposal agency.
   Sandra Lucas of the state's Environmental Police said the
problem is really part-skunk and part-people. She said if residents
could learn to cap their garbage, close up basement windows and not
bother the skunks people could coexist with the mammals.
   Wildlife workers occasionally are called to come to the aid of a
skunk found stumbling along with a head trapped in a yogurt
container or jelly jar. But more often, they get complaints.
   Lucas' favorite comes from people who call to say their dog was
sprayed while he was out running around the neighborhood.
   ``They violate the leash law, their dog gets sprayed, and they
want me to kill the skunk,'' she said.
