   Colossus is getting a gorilla
girlfriend.
   Muke, pronouced ``Moo-key,'' will be the first member of his
species that Colossus, billed as the largest lowland gorilla in
captivity, will have seen since infancy when she arrives next
Wednesday at The Zoo.
   ``Hopefully, she's good looking,'' said Pat Quinn, director of
The Zoo. ``I'd hate to have him mad at me for the rest of his
life.''
   Muke will be on breeding loan from the St. Louis Zoo.
   Colossus, 6-2 and more than 550 pounds, took his first step
outside in about 20 years March 18, when zoo officials allowed him
to explore a spacious outdoor habitat.
   Colossus was moved to the zoo outside this Pensacola suburb from
Benson's Animal Park in Hudson, N.H., where he had been kept in a
small indoor cage since his capture in West Africa.
   A prior effort to produce offspring from Colossus through
artificial insemination failed just before his move to Florida
because the huge ape wasn't very sexually active. Quinn said
Colossus has shown signs of more sexual interest at his new home
and hopes the introduction of a female will heighten his fervor.
   To prepare for his first glimpse of another gorilla, scientists
from the University of West Florida have been showing him National
Geographic videotapes of gorillas.
   ``He did respond,'' Quinn said. ``He was most interested in
gorillas that interacted with humans because that's what he is used
to.''
   A young male chimpanzee has been placed in a room adjoining that
of Colossus in the zoo's gorilla house to get the huge ape used to
the idea of having someone next door.
   Muke will replace the chimp. At first they will be allowed only
to look at and smell each other. Later, a door between the two
rooms will be opened wide enough so they can touch, and finally
wide enough so the female can enter Colossus' room.
   The match was arranged by the Gorilla Species Survival Plan
Committee of the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
   Gorillas are an endangered species, and Colossus is seen as
particularly attractive for breeding because he was captured in the
wild and will introduce new genes into the community of captive
apes.
   Even if they fail to mate, Muke would have accomplished one goal
if she can get him to socialize with another member of the species.
In the wild, dominant male gorillas don't have a single mate, but
preside over veritable harems.
