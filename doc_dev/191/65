FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sharp fall to Pounds 1.3m at Hopkinsons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Hopkinsons Group, the industrial valve and hydraulic
equipment maker, showed a marked decline, from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 1.34m,
in the six months to end-July. The shares closed 7p lower at 32p.
The pre-tax figure was struck after an interest charge of Pounds 608,000,
against income of Pounds 1.29m, and an exceptional provision of Pounds
600,000 for redundancy costs in the gas division.
Mr Ralph Goodall, chairman, said last year's interest income had been
eliminated on the purchase of Carbo in October last year. Borrowing had
increased, he added, but gearing, at 41 per cent, remained within acceptable
limits.
Turnover jumped to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 18.7m) reflecting a full six months'
contribution from Carbo. Group operating profits improved by 48 per cent to
Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.7m).
Mr Goodall said there was currently no sign of an upturn in the group's main
markets and the timing and extent of any recovery remained uncertain, with
no expectation of significant improvement within the next 12 months.
The interim dividend is reduced to 0.9p (1.2p), payable from earnings of
1.4p (3.18p) per share.
