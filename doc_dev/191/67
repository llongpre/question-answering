<LEADPARA>  WHY CAN'T CHIMPANZEES TALK worth a hoot?;    SO FAR THE LONGEST STATEMENT EVER
made by an ape (in sign language) was by a chimpanzee: "Give orange me give
eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you." (Translation: "The
oranges here are fabulous.")  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The genetic codes of humans and chimps diverge by only about 2 percent.
Chimpanzees have eyes and hearts and lungs essentially identical to ours. They
have emotions. They use tools. So why don't they speak?;    The answer
(physiologically) is that they don't have the right brains or throats.;    In
apes, the larynx, a valve-like device that lets air from the windpipe into the
throat, is up high, and can form an airtight lock with the nasal cavity,
allowing the creature to breathe even as it is eating or drinking.;    In
humans, the larynx is much lower; choking is a direct side-effect of the
anatomy that allows human speech. Charles Darwin himself noted what a
boneheaded thing it was for humans to have food pass right by a hole leading
into the lungs. One major advantage of the low larynx, though, is that it
allows us to make non-nasal sounds, which can be far more distinct than nasal
noises. (Bob Dylan has yet to perfect this.);    Even if apes had this kind of
throat, they wouldn't make sentences. The ability to understand grammar is a
human adaptation, wired into every baby's brain. Philip Lieberman states in
his book Uniquely Human that chimpanzees can acquire a limited vocabulary but
cannot grasp the rules of syntax that a 3-year-old human child can master.;   
"Nor do chimpanzees or other animals ever create works of art or complex
devices, or convey 'creative' thoughts," he writes. "Nor do they, in their
natural state, adhere to the most basic aspects of higher human moral sense.";
   They're a bunch of animals!;  GUESS AGAIN; ELIZABETH TAYLOR AND RICHARD
BURTON starred in Mike Nichols' film Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Whom did

Bette Davis and James Mason; C. Doris Day and Rock Hudson; D. Vivien Leigh and
Laurence Olivier; E. Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn (Answer below);  ANSWER: B.  </TEXT>
