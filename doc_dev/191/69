Scapa's low City profile and overseas expansion

AMID ALL the current despondency about manufacturing, some companies
continue to thrive in profitable, if obscure, niches.
The Blackburn-based Scapa Group, which supplies technical products and
services to the paper industry, is a good example of a company which is one
of only a handful of international companies in its field, yet is little
known in the City.
A telling reason for both the success and low public profile is the scale of
its overseas activities. The group's 6,500 employees work in 48
manufacturing companies, located in 15 countries, with fewer than half based
in the UK.
Papermaking involves the forming, pressing and drying of wood pulp. Scapa
makes the engineered fabrics and roll coverings which hold the paper
throughout this process. Since even shareholders might not be clear what
that means, the group's latest annual report has a large illustration of a
papermaking machine, highlighting all the parts which Scapa can equip.
Scapa, which last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 44.7m on turnover of
Pounds 300m, has seen its steady record of earnings growth checked as the
paper industry has passed through the trough of recession.
However, it has increased market share and continued to improve its products
as structural changes in the industry have favoured larger companies. The
surviving paper makers use fewer suppliers to service bigger machines,
requir-ing greater technical input.
Only three international companies supply all parts of the paper-making
machine, Albany International, the private US company which is market
leader, BTR, the industrial conglomerate, and Scapa.
Consolidation in the paper industry has led to more competitive buying by
paper makers, squeezing suppliers' margins. However, analysts believe that
by matching the manufacturing concentration suppliers will gain greater
efficiency and that margins are likely to improve in the long-term.
Profits from the roll covering business have suffered from the recent
scarcity of new machines. But the consumption of engineered fabrics is
likely to grow with the increased use of recycled paper and as machine
speeds reach their performance limits.
Scapa has been very successful at building greenfield manufacturing plants,
particularly in the US, where it followed the paper industry south.
About 60 per cent of operating profit originates in the US, making it
sensitive to exchange rate movements. The group estimates that for every
cent the dollar appreciates against sterling, pre-tax profits increase by
Pounds 150,000. To a lesser extent it also benefits from selling more
UK-manufactured output in the US.
Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, said he was struck during the recent sterling
crisis how almost all attention seemed to focus on the sterling/D-Mark
exchange rate. 'I cannot understand why no-one mentioned the dollar. The US
is still our biggest export earner, yet both Tory and Labour politicians
don't seem well informed on this.'
The consolidation of the paper industry is being speeded by takeovers and
mergers, a trend illustrated by Scapa's Pounds 27.3m purchase last year of
Scandiafelt, a Swedish competitors.
Mr Goodall said the purchase had increased market share and not just in
Scandinavia. 'Powerful Swedish paper companies had bought their way into
Germany, and owning Scandia takes us with them.'
South-east Asia offers long-term growth opportunities for the paper
industry. Scapa has no immediate plans to establish manufacturing plants
there, although Mr Goodall said it would no doubt happen eventually.
Because customers are widely spread, with different needs, south-east Asia
is supplied by exports from Europe and North America. The high-value nature
of the goods makes freight charges relatively insignificant.
Analysts are less keen on Scapa's 'other industries' businesses, which
account for 40 per cent of sales but only 20 per cent of operating profits.
These are mainly UK-based and have suffered from the impact of the
recession.
Mr David Dunn, finance director, conceded that the industrial materials
division serving 'other industries' enjoyed lower margins, but stressed that
it offered a much more rapid return on capital than the investment-hungry
paper businesses.
The industrial materials division has been extensively rationalised to focus
on filtration technology and industrial tapes. Although Scapa accepted that
its efforts would be mainly concerned with servicing the paper industry, Mr
Goodall believed the other areas offered good long-term growth prospects.
Scapa's strong market position has not been achieved cheaply. In the
document accompanying its Pounds 55.6m rights issue last year, the group
said it had invested Pounds 171m in the businesses since the previous fund
raising in 1985. Of this, a third was spent on acquisitions, one third on
replacement capital and the rest on new technology or greenfield sites.
Scapa recently assured the City that it would take 'no major leap into the
unknown' to develop the industrial products division. Such an assurance was
probably unnecessary from a group which embodies the qualities which are
supposedly so rare in British manufacturing - a willingness to look
long-term and invest heavily.
