My husband is the parent with credibility in this family. I lost mine the day I 
threatened one of the kids with, "You clean your room or you'll never see me 
again. I mean it. I'm going to go to Africa and sit on a hillside with Jane 
Goodall and watch chimpanzees for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
They knew I was bluffing. I wasn't going to do that. I wouldn't go anywhere 
without a mall nearby. 
</P>
<P>
After years of my exaggeration, they just sort of roll their eyes upward, shake 
their heads and say, "Mom! You can't believe anything she tells you." But when 
their father speaks . . . every word is chiseled on stone tablets. It is so. 
</P>
<P>
He is to integrity what Walter Cronkite is to broadcasting, Mother Teresa is to 
the poor and Lawrence Welk is to the polka. In a world of Janet Cookes, Ivan 
Boeskys and Milli Vanillis, he shines like a beacon of goodness. He has given 
his children their motto for life: "In Dad We Trust." 
</P>
<P>
(I know this is taking a long time to build, but it's necessary to point out 
how far he had to fall.) 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago at breakfast, the Prince of Goodness announced to his son 
(a USC grad) that the Trojans had beaten Notre Dame. He had heard it on a 
late-night sportscast. 
</P>
<P>
The kid was not only numb, he was ecstatic. Imagine that. SC knocked off the 
Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Later that night, he and his brother were flipping TV channels when they landed 
on a replay of the USC-Notre Dame game. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Notre Dame was winning, our younger son wasn't worried. His father 
had told him the final score. 
</P>
<P>
With five minutes left to play, his brother said, "It's all over." 
</P>
<P>
The kid who had heard his dad's proclamation of a USC victory stood firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The game's not over until it's over," he smiled. "They'll pull it out of the 
fire. You'll see." 
</P>
<P>
His brother looked at him like his pilot light just went out. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you nuts? There's no way in the world USC can win." 
</P>
<P>
With a minute left, the younger brother's eyes were still glued to the screen 
awaiting the miracle that was prophesied. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't rule out an 80-yard pass," he said to his brother. "They don't even have 
the ball," his brother yelled back. 
</P>
<P>
When the final score was announced -- Notre Dame 10, USC 6 -- I expected him to 
lose faith in his dad . . . kind of like finding out Smokey the Bear plays with 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he smiled and said, "Dad probably did me a big favor. Anyone else 
would have walked out in the third quarter."
