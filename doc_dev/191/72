<TEXT>
Baroness Dean (above left), of Thornton-le-Fylde, formerly Brenda Dean who
was general secretary of the trade union Sogat, has gained her first
non-executive directorship. She is joining the board of INVERESK, the
Fife-based specialist paper group, which floated on the stock exchange last
year.
The company has also appointed Bill Goodall (above right) as non-executive
chairman, replacing Ingram Lenton who is resigning his directorships because
of ill-health.
Dean, who became a Labour life peer last year after stepping down as deputy
general secretary of the GPMU, into which Sogat - the principal union for
paper workers - merged, won the respect of the paper industry for her
constructive attitude to change. The industry last year awarded her its gold
medal.
Lenton, a former managing director of the papermakers Bowater, chaired
Inveresk after its management bought it out of Georgia Pacific in 1990 and
steered it through last year's flotation. Goodall, who retired as executive
chairman of the mini-conglomerate Scapa Group in October, was intended to be
Lenton's successor but has had his appointment to the chair speeded up.
Inveresk now complies with the Cadbury Report strictures, having a
non-executive chairman and, now with Dean, two non-executive directors. Ian
Boyd, finance director of Weir Group, joined the board last year.
