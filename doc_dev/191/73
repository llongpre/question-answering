   A team of Harvard University researchers claimed "the first apparent vaccine protection against AIDS virus infection" in a small experiment involving rhesus monkeys. 

   The researchers warned that the success against the deadly and still incurable acquired immune deficiency syndrome was achieved under hothouse laboratory conditions. 
They further cautioned that it would be premature to apply their findings to human disease prevention. 

   Still, after years of inconclusive vaccine reports and many failed animal tests, the report provided a spark of hope. 

   "It's encouraging," said Robert C. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute. 
In contrast to previous successes limited to cat and mouse viruses, he said, "This means it's true that you can get protection against a primate retrovirus infection that's related to one in man. 
Have we known that before? 
No." 

   The report, by Ronald Desrosiers, M.D. Daniel and their colleagues at Harvard and the New England Regional Primate Research Center, is published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 

   Their experiment focused on simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV, which causes an AIDS-like disease in monkeys. 
Researchers used a whole, killed virus to vaccinate six rhesus monkeys. 
One week later they injected infectious live virus into the six vaccinated animals and into four unvaccinated control animals. 

   All of the control animals became infected; three of them died of AIDS, and the fourth remains persistently infected. 

   The six vaccinated animals fared better. 
While four contracted the infection, none became ill with AIDS, though one animal later died of unrelated causes. 
Two didn't become infected at all, suggesting the vaccine may have prevented the virus from even gaining a toehold in the body. 

   Mr. Desrosiers admits he stacked the conditions for success, principally by scheduling his animals' exposure to the live virus just one week after inoculation, when protective antibody levels were believed to be at their peak. 
An earlier study by the Desrosiers group, challenging the animals' immune systems 12 weeks after vaccination, failed to protect the monkeys against infection. 

   The test also used a smaller dose of infectious virus to challenge the vaccine's protective powers than other researchers have used. 
And it used exactly the same strain of SIV as the vaccine -- a situation that probably wouldn't occur in nature. 

   "When everyone {in AIDS vaccine research} started out, we were all optimistic and hopeful. 
After a number of failures, everyone realized it would be a tough job," Mr. Desrosiers said. 
"Then we retreated and asked if we could get success under any conditions. 
Our report is the first such success." 

   Paul Luciw, a scientist at the University of California at Davis, said he did a similar experiment -- using a virus that was 100 times more infectious -- to challenge the vaccine and failed to prevent infection. 
Nevertheless, he said, despite these limitations, "Ron's work is important because he established a protocol which gives a certain level of efficacy." 

   "I wouldn't say this is a major breakthrough," said Patricia Fultz, a primate researcher at the Yerkes Primate Center at Emory University in Atlanta, "but it gives promise that there may be protection against one of these viruses." 

   SIV is about 40% identical to the human AIDS virus. 
But it is gaining support as a model for AIDS vaccine research. 
Other experiments, which inject human AIDS virus into chimpanzees, are troubled by several factors. 
One is the scarcity and expense of chimps. 
Another is the fact that chimps, while they may become infected with the human AIDS virus, never become sick, which limits the possibility for comparisons with people. 
SIV, on the other hand, both infects and causes AIDS-like disease in the plentiful rhesus monkeymaking it "an excellent experimental model," Mr. Luciw said. 

   Yet, Dr. Gallo said, SIV isn't the same virus: "It's 60% different {from the AIDS virus}. 
And the recipient is a monkey, whose immune response isn't the same as that of a human being." 

   Mr. Desrosiers said his next step is to design a vaccine experiment that can achieve not 33% but "uniform, 100% protection" of animals against infection. 
Then, he said, he'll test whether his vaccine can protect against challenge by a different strain of SIV. 
"It's premature to push this approach in humans," he said. 
There's no indication it "will work in the real world." 

   The dark side of whole-virus vaccines remains the fear that some live virus particles could survive to infect, rather than protect, the vaccine recipient. 
Even after the Desrosiers report, "I still don't think whole virus vaccine will ever be tolerable in man," Dr. Gallo said. 

   A number of groups are said to be exploring lines of research similar to those of the Desrosiers team, notably Michael Murphey-Corb at the Delta Regional Primate Research Center in Covington, La. 
Dr. Murphey-Corb couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, hailed the Desrosiers work as "an important first step." 
While it leaves unanswered the practical question of whether this model works in the real world, Dr. Fauci said, "Scientifically, the question was, is there such a thing as a protective immune response" against AIDS? 
"We now know that there is."
