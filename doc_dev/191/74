   Foodmaker Inc., the operator and
franchiser of Jack in the Box restaurants, will acquire Chi-Chi's
Inc., a 200-unit Mexican restaurant chain, in a leveraged buyout
for about $230 million, the companies announced Monday.
   Under the agreement, which has been approved by the boards of
both companies, Foodmaker will acquire Chi-Chi's in a $10.15 a
share tender offer. The sale was expected to be completed about
April 1.
   ``We believe it will be an excellent vehicle, along with the
Jack in the Box chain, for growth acceleration and to build
stockholder value,'' said Jack W. Goodall Jr., chairman and
president of Foodmakers.
   San Diego-based Foodmaker will finance the acquisition with
short-term loans from a group of banks led by Wells Fargo Bank NA,
Goodall said, but Foodmaker was confident Chi-Chi's cash flow would
be sufficient to fund the purchase.
   He also said Chi-Chi's headquarters would remain in Louisville
with its current management.
   ``We think this transaction, which is not conditioned upon
obtaining financing, is in the best interest of our stockholders,
and we are pleased that Foodmaker intends to continue the growth of
Chi-Chi's and maintain our headquarters in Louisville,'' said Hal
Smith, chairman and chief executive of Chi-Chi's.
   Chi-Chi's operates and franchises full-service Mexican
restuarants. For the six months ended Oct. 31, Chi-Chi's had net
income of $6.7 million on revenue of $144.5 million.
   Foodmaker Inc., operates and franchises more than 900 Jack in
the Box fast-food restaurants located mainly in the western and
southwestern United States.
   Foodmaker had net earnings of $13.9 million in 1987 on revenue
of $598 million.
