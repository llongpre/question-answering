HOPKINSONS Group saw profits tumble from Pounds 5.16m to Pounds 2.06m
pre-tax over the 12 months to January 31 leading the Huddersfield-based
abrasives, plastic products and gas control equipment company to cut its
dividend.
The shares fell 4p to 40p.
Profits were struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 600,000 (Pounds
900,000) to cover redundancies at the Bryan Donkin engineering operation
which was hit by the decision by British Gas, its largest customer, to
reduce capital spending.
The figures marked the first full year's inclusion of Carbo, the industrial
abrasives group acquired for some Pounds 31m in 1991. The move wiped out
Hopkinsons' cash pile and led to a turnround from interest income of Pounds
1.46m to payable of Pounds 1.13m.
Net borrowings amounted to Pounds 12.8m at the year-end, giving gearing of
38 per cent. Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 2.8m in a
'closely-controlled investment programme' according to Mr Bill Goodall,
chairman.
Group turnover amounted to Pounds 102.5m (Pounds 59.4m including Carbo for
four months). After a 49 per cent tax charge earnings per share fell from
4.57p to 1.31p; the proposed final dividend is cut to 0.4p (2.5p) for a
total of 1.3p (3.7p).
Mr Goodall said the group had been hit by the impact of 'deepening
industrial recession' on the abrasives business.
Current trading was about the same level as in the second half of last year,
he added, with the exception of Germany which was 'particularly affected by
the recession'.
