   A Japanese monkey on the loose for 10
months in southern Indiana is feasting on bananas, peanut butter
and cat food this week while authorities try to figure out how to
capture the wily fugitive.
   ``He's been here twice today so far,'' said Janice Rodgers, who
spotted the Japanese macaque last week and began feeding it.
   ``He ate peanut butter sandwiches yesterday because I was out of
bananas,'' she said Tuesday. ``He liked them real well, except he
got real disgusted when he got peanut butter between his _ I guess
you would call them his fingers.''
   The Japanese macaque, dubbed ``Jack the Macaque'' by Mrs.
Rodgers, stands about 3{ feet tall, weighs about 30 pounds and has
a silky, tan coat.
   Macaques are generally found in southern Asia and the East
Indies. Jack, a resourceful little primate, survived the winter
apparently by foraging.
   Conservation officers say he runs away as soon as someone in
uniform appears. ``He's a pretty smart monkey,'' said Gary Ault,
conservation officer at Paynetown. ``He's kind of allergic to
uniforms.''
   He escaped about 10 months ago from the Reptile Kingdom in Brown
County, about 35 miles from Mrs. Rodgers' home here near the
Hoosier National Forest.
   Attempts to recapture the monkey have failed. On Friday, Jack
turned up his nose at three tranquilized bananas in favor of a dish
of cat food behind the Rodgers' house.
   ``He hadn't done that before,'' said Mrs. Rodgers. ``Then he
went out and sat down by the bananas and took a couple of bites and
spit them out.'' Jack was a little woozy, but made it back to the
woods.
   When Mrs. Rodgers first saw the monkey last Wednesday she called
her husband, Sam, who was at work. While he phoned the sheriff's
department, she offered Jack some apples, carrots and bread.
   ``He just kind of looked at me like, `Oh, please.' I didn't
really know what to do,'' she said. ``I didn't want to scare him
away, so I did what I thought (ape researcher) Jane Goodall would
do, I squatted down low so that I was about his size.''
   When the police car pulled up, the monkey grabbed an apple and
carrot and ran for the woods.
   The animal isn't considered especially dangerous, though Mrs.
Rodgers said owner Thomas Tilton told her the monkey might attack
if he felt threatened.
   ``He's just as cute as he can be,'' said Mrs. Rodgers, adding
that she won't be too disappointed if future attempts to recapture
the monkey also fail.
   ``I know the owner wants him back,'' she said. ``But I just
couldn't stand for them to drug him.''

   Five Mississippi ninth-graders who beat
200 other teams playing a stock market simulation say they used the
strategies and tactics of real investors to reap a $110,723 ``paper
profit.''
   And just like real investors they had a fearful day when the
market crashed on Oct. 19. As the stock market plummeted 508
points, they were left holding a handful of cheap stocks that no
one wanted to buy.
   ``We lost $34,000,'' said Auburn Wessman of Bailey Alternative
School. ``We wanted to buy some penny stocks because they go up a
higher percentage. But the crash came along, and they just went
down, down, down.''
   The 15-year-old is one of five Bailey ninth-graders who played
the stock market in a 10-week game sponsored by McLarty &amp; Co. and
The Clarion-Ledger-Jackson Daily News.
   More than 200 Mississippi teams competed with others across the
nation in the game, developed by the Securities Industries
Association and coordinated by the American Enterprise Center.
   Each team started with an imaginary $100,000 and a $100,000 line
of credit. They bought and sold stocks according to daily closing
prices, and even paid imaginary broker fees.
   The Bailey group, led by government teacher Johnny Gilbert,
followed stocks in USA Today and watched business reports daily.
They met for two hours every week to make plans to buy and sell.
   Their strategy was to short-sell an engineering stock, get rid
of two others at a profit, and hold onto the earnings with stable
IBM.
   Gilbert wanted his six teams to learn how to take risks and how
to recover from mistakes. He offered advice but didn't force the
teams to follow it.
   ``I just told them to ask, `What companies might make some
money?''' Gilbert said. ``It's hard to teach the risk, but I told
them it's like a big crap game.''
