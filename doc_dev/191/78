   A premature newborn chimpanzee named Lilly is
alive today thanks to volunteer pediatric specialists who brought
their hospital skills to an animal-care nursery.
   ``I think the No. 1 thing was that it sounded like they needed
some help,'' said Dr. Lance Wyble of the neonatal unit at Tampa
General Hospital. ``Also, I felt it would be a challenge. The
veterinarian wasn't too familiar with the situation, and I was very
familiar with it. The whole thing had a lot of appeal.''
   Wyble, two nurses and a respiratory therapist from the hospital
and a blood bank doctor teamed up with Busch Gardens veterinarian
John Olson here three weeks ago to save the 2-pound primate.
   Today, Lilly seems to winning her battle to survive. The chimp
is out of intensive care, and she's alert and is taking formula on
her own, although she still has a stomach tube for feeding.
   The medical team is following the chimp for any developing
problems, anemia or episodes of failed breathing.
   ``She's still got a long ways to go,'' Wyble said Thursday
night. ``We're looking for evidence of good weight gain _ that's
the ultimate proof that everything is going well.''
   The medical team twice had to revive Lilly when breathing
stopped and her heart rate fell dramatically.
   They also ran intravenous fluids, attached monitoring equipment,
hooked up oxygen, injected antibiotics, inserted feeding tubes,
tested blood gases and gave transfusions.
   ``I felt like I was at work. That's how critical it was. She was
dying,'' said nurse Peggy Herman.
   ``After the first 15 minutes you forgot it was an ape and could
see how much she was like one of our babies,'' said the other
nurse, Kathy Arnold.
   ``It's so neat to be able to use your experience and background
to help another species,'' she said. ``It wasn't like Lilly was
weird. She was just like a baby _ she'd grasp your finger, want to
cling, whimper when you start an IV.''
   Ms. Herman, a critical-care nurse for nearly 15 years; Ms.
Arnold, with 10 years in nursing; and respiration therapist Bob
Tursi volunteered their help.
   The chimpanzee was born March 31 at Busch Gardens, a wildlife
and amusement park that is home to 334 species of animals. Olson
said he thinks Lilly was born two to three weeks short of the
normal 7{-month gestation period.
