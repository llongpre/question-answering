  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The Korean agricultural 
team has gone on the offensive in trade negotiations. In recent 
talks, Seoul has bluntly told its trading partners to import 
Korean farm products or accept its export conditions, the 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Tuesday. 
  The ministry held separate quarterly beef talks with 
Australia, New Zealand and the United States this month and 
strongly urged them to carry forward this year's excess import 
volume to the 1995 quota. It reminded them of Seoul's 
concessions to beef exporters in a series of talks and the 
Uruguay Round negotiations and told them it was their turn to 
compromise. 
  In a meeting with visiting Chinese Internal Trade Minister 
Zhang Haoruo on Monday, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
Minister Choe In-ki pointed out Korea's growing trade deficit 
with China in the agricultural sector. 
  Korea imported 1,055 million U.S. dollars worth of Chinese 
farm, fisheries and livestock products last year while exports 
only came to 35 million dollars, resulting in a 
1.02-billion-dollar deficit. Seoul reportedly asked Beijing to 
import more Korean processed farm goods, vegetables and apples. 
  Choe, meeting his Canadian counterpart Ralph Goodale last 
Saturday, strongly requested that the North American country 
lift a ban on Korean apples. Goodale, in turn, asked Korea to 
purchase 300,000 tons of feed barley and lower tariffs on rape 
imports. Seoul refused, pointing out that barley was 
inefficient as feed compared with other grains and because Korea 
would nevertheless have to import barley from next year under 
the UR agreement. It also explained that it could not lower the 
tariff on rape because rape farmers on Cheju island would be 
hurt. Canada, the world's largest barley grower, has been 
persistent in trying to sell its products to Korea.
