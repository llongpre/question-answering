   Frustrated by a ban on importing chimpanzees,
U.S. officials are looking into shifting AIDS tests on the animals
to Africa and the Soviet Union, a move experts call a needless
death blow to the last chimps in the wild.
   ``This is very, very bad,'' said Jane Goodall, a leading
chimpanzee specialist who was recently in Washington to alert
legislators to the unannounced program. ``It is not a choice of
AIDS or chimps. Enough can be bred in captivity.''
   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., a veterinarian, has threatened to
block such a move.
   The director of the National Institutes of Health, James
Wyngaarden, confirmed in an interview that the government agency is
considering AIDS research projects in Africa and the Soviet Union
because U.S. law bans importation of chimpanzees.
   ``We clearly don't want to get into an international fracas over
seeming to subvert rules that apply in this country,'' Wyngaarden
said. But, he added, ``we're taking lots of looks at Africa.''
   He provided no specifics. But confidential minutes obtained by
The Associated Press show that NIH decided quietly in March to
identify target groups of African chimpanzees and explore means of
using them in research.
   According to the minutes, an NIH committee decided to develop
``an African chimp field survey to provide us with the numbers of
animals, serological (blood) information and (their) condition.''
   Possible sites for research include a laboratory in Liberia
operated by the New York Blood Center and the Sukhumi center in
Soviet Georgia, which would have to import chimps, since
specialists say it now has none.
   Chimps, which were instrumental in developing a hepatitis B
vaccine, are valuable research subjects because their genetic
material varies less than 1 percent from man's. In current
research, scientists are injecting chimps with experimental
vaccines for AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Wyngaarden said NIH scientists want more chimpanzees than are
available, but are thwarted by the U.S. Endangered Species Act and
the 14-year-old Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species, a treaty that prohibits trade in animals threatened with
extinction.
   Experts fear that, once in Africa, researchers would have access
to chimpanzees smuggled illegally across borders from endangered
colonies, sometimes with false documentation.
   Goodall said new chimpanzee roundups, during which hunters often
kill adults in order to get at the young, ``would not only have a
devastating effect on chimpanzees but would bring them to
extinction.''
   An average of 10 mothers and babies are killed for every infant
chimp successfully exported, she said in a telephone interview from
England.
   Goodall and eight eminent American and European biomedical
experts wrote to Nature magazine saying that although chimpanzees
were essential to AIDS research, enough could be bred for
laboratory purposes.
   ``Going to Africa is no solution,'' said Marc Girard of the
Pasteur Institute in Paris. ``We must breed more, better use those
we have and find alternatives.''
   Geza Teleki, an American primatologist who heads a
Washington-based international specialist group, the Committee for
Conservation and Care of Chimpanzees, said too little has been done
to breed captive chimps.
   ``The bottom line is competition for the few chimpanzees still
hanging on in Africa and to hell with all the national and
international laws protecting them,'' Teleki contended,
   A 1978 chimpanzee census commissioned by NIH showed chimp
populations extinct or depleted across much of their traditional
African range. The unpublished census was made public recently by
Teleki an other specialists.
   Most chimpanzees in medical research originated in West Africa,
where their number has dropped this century from a million to about
17,000, Teleki said. Outside of West Africa, he said, only Zairean
and South African authorities control large groups of chimps.
   ``The NIH clearly intends to continue being an accomplice in
driving the species to extinction beyond the view of the American
public,'' Teleki asserted.
   Sen. Melcher said he opposed such a transfer of U.S. chimpanzee
research to Africa.
   ``NIH is going to have to abide by international agreement,''
Melcher said, warning that Congress could block any move
``offshore'' by inserting restrictions in NIH appropriations.
   The number of chimpanzees already used in U.S. research is in
dispute.
   Wyngaarden said only 400 to 600 chimps are available, and the
infant mortality is 30 percent in breeding centers used by NIH.
   But Jan Moor-Jankowski, director of Lemsip, a large
primate-research facility in New York, challenged the figures,
saying NIH has access to 800 animals, more than 100 are born each
year and that number could be increased.
