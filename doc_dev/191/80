   Her days of glamour and glitz are over. Jade,
an 8-year-old star chimpanzee, is retiring.
   Known as Zippy during her career, Jade is a Clio and Emmy award
winner. Among her credits are stints on ``Late Night With David
Letterman'' and appearances in rock music videos.
   She arrived Tuesday at a primate sanctuary about 30 miles
northwest of San Antonio known as Primarily Primates Inc. The
privately funded facility cares for animals that might die by
abandonment or laboratory experimentation.
   Jade's owners, Frank and Beverly Krevens from New York's Long
Island said they were surprised at how quickly she adapted to her
retirement environment.
   ``I thought she (first) would be in a period of mourning,''
Beverly Krevens said, ``but we put her in one of the enclosures and
she immediately took to it. She started running and climbing all
over.''
   In human years, Jade is 40 to 50 years old.
   Mrs. Krevens is convinced the chimp's new home will be a happy
one.
   ``We cried a trail of tears coming down here because we're going
to miss her dearly, but we know this is the best place,'' she said.
