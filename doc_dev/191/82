<HEAD>Zoo Visitor Turns Lifeguard, Hauls 135-Pound Chimp from Moat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A passer-by became a heroic lifeguard in
an unlikely locale when a chimpanzee jumped into a 5-foot-deep moat
at the Detroit Zoo.
   The man, who asked zoo officials not to identify him, hauled the
135-pound chimp from the moat Sunday and pulled it safely onto an
island where 10 chimpanzees are kept.
   As many as 1,000 people were in the area when the 18-year-old
male chimp jumped into the moat, zoo spokeswoman Pat Butkiewicz
said.
   ``I heard this splash,'' said witness Sherry Huntington.
``People started screaming, `He's going to drown!' You saw him
surface a little bit, then go down. It was like watching a drowning
person. That poor animal.''
   In April, a 20-year-old female chimp drowned in the moat a week
after the $7.5-million exhibit opened.
   Chimpanzees cannot swim because they have too little body fat.
Zoo officials aren't sure why the chimps jumped into the moat. The
outdoor portion of the chimp exhibit was closed indefinitely.
