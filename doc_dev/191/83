<TEXT>  William Morrow, 316 pp., $21;  'UNIQUE, isn't it? Africa. That heat . . . the
life. . . . We'll never really change it. Not deep down.";    Author William
Boyd gave those words to one of the self-absorbed British diplomats in "A Good
Man in Africa," his rollicking novel from the early 1980s about the pitfalls
of manipulative Westerners working in Africa. It's a telling line: romantic,
perhaps, but profoundly true.;    Boyd returns to the theme of Western folly
and presumptuousness in Africa in "Brazzaville Beach," a novel that has won
the Tait Black Memorial Prize, England's oldest literary award.;   
"Brazzaville" combines two narratives of Hope Clearwater, a young Briton who
has taken refuge on Brazzaville Beach in west-central Africa to sort out
recent calamities, one in Britain, the other in Africa. It is the first time
that Boyd, a Briton who grew up in West Africa, has given the narrator's voice
to a woman.;    Clearwater is a highly educated though not very likable woman.
She is talented but indifferent and something of a lush. Her two tales unfold
consecutively, one in first-person, the other in third.;    The ordeal that
propels Clearwater to Africa is the insanity and suicide of her husband, John,
a tweedy mathematician. His research into turbulence and his arcane attempt to
draft a theorem to explain the world's uncertainty drive him to madness. He
takes to digging holes in the earth to encourage flashes of insight.;    Hope
Clearwater's other, richer tale is about her ordeal in Africa as a junior
member of the research team of Eugene Mallabar, an eminent authority on
chimpanzees and their behavior. Mallabar has written "The Peaceful Primate"
and "Primate's Progress" and is completing his chef-d'oeuvre, "the last word
on chimpanzee society," when Clearwater makes some stunning discoveries.;   
Her assignment was to record the behavior of a band of chimpanzees that had
broken away from the main group. The schism, Clearwater finds, is a deadly
one. The chimpanzees have fallen into warring factions, the larger of which
inflicts violence on the other. Mallabar's peaceful primates, she finds, are
capable of infanticide, torture and cannibalism -- behavior that, if
disclosed, would challenge Mallabar's research and darken his reputation.;   
Mallabar tries at first to cover up Clearwater's findings. Soon, a fire of
suspicious origin destroys her field notes. Finally, though, Mallabar
witnesses the chimp wars. And he cracks, accusing Clearwater of creating
conditions that provoked the chimpanzees. He turns on her, probably to kill
her.;    She escapes, catching a ride out of the research compound with a
colleague on a fortnightly run for provisions. But before they reach town,
they are stopped at a roadblock manned by remnants of one of the rebel
factions locked in a civil war that has sputtered for years.;    The rebels
are teen-agers, recruited from a volleyball team called Atomique Bombe.
Clearwater and her colleague are taken captive by this improbable band.;    By
this point, "Brazzaville" may seem to verge on chaos, but Boyd pulls together
the narrative convincingly, demonstrating the penchant for mild surprise that
he showed in "Good Man.";    The Africa chapters -- especially those about the
chimp wars -- are by far the superior sections of "Brazzaville." In them Boyd
depicts the relentlessness of Africa and the dangers for Westerners who grow
too confident about working their will on the troubled continent.  </TEXT>
