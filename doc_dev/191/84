SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS
by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Random
Century Pounds 17.99, 505 pages
NEITHER the New Ageist title nor the mawkish cover illustration does this
book justice. Within, it is a feast. Absorbing and elegantly written, it
tells of the origins of life on earth, describes its variety and character,
and culminates in a discussion of human nature and the complex traces of
humankind's evolutionary past - hence the 'shadows' of the title. This is
fascinating science gracefully purveyed. The exposition is leisurely,
literate and wry, sometimes self-indulgent but always pleasingly so. It is
an amazing story masterfully told - easily the best popular introduction to
ethology and evolutionary biology now available.
The story begins at the beginning: with the turbulent mass of dust and gas
which spawned the sun and its planets, and prompted the frightening early
history of earth. Thereafter the tale unfolds more circumstantially. Its
proper commencement lies with the stromatolites, single-celled organisms
living in colonies, whose fossils date back three and a half billion years.
From these most ancient of creatures life's perilous history stems.
To recount that history Sagan and Druyan have to explain genetics and
evolutionary theory. They do it with exemplary lucidity. Thus armed, they
give dazzling accounts of insects, snakes, apes, humans, and much besides,
aiming to give us a sense of humanity's place in the evolutionary scheme by
exhibiting the enormous variety and curiosity of life and the connections
which unify its story. 'We achieve some measure of adulthood', the authors
write, 'when we recognise our parents as they really were, without
sentimentalising or mythologising, but also without blaming them unfairly
for our imperfections.' When with similar dispassion we understand something
of our evolutionary inheritance - our biological parentage - we come of age
as a species.
Every page yields nuggets. The kind of lesson to be learned from biological
understanding is well illustrated by the following juxtaposition of facts.
Humans find it convenient to geld male domestic animals. 'One or two skilled
motions of the blade - or a deft bite by a reindeer-herding Lapp woman - and
the testosterone levels are down to manageable proportions', the authors
remark. Only a few males are left intact for breeding purposes. In the wild,
when one male is defeated by another in a mating contest - and this applies
to creatures as different as snakes and apes - the conquered male's
testosterone levels decline steeply and he slinks away. One major effect, as
with domestic animals, is that trouble is kept within bounds.
Parallels must be treated cautiously. Humans and chimpanzees share 99.6 per
cent of their active genes, inherited from a common ancestor. By any
standards this is close kinship. But the differences - outstandingly,
language and what language makes possible - are more obvious than the
similarities. Still, as the authors show in four fascinating chapters on
monkeys and apes, both the parallels and differences are highly instructive.
One female chimp, taught to sort pictures of humans and non-humans into
different categories, placed pictures of chimps in the 'human' file.
The authors venture some controversial sallies. Sagan is famous for arguing
that there must be life elsewhere in the universe. Here he and Druyan make
an analogous suggestion: that consciousness might be a more pervasive
feature of terrestrial life than most thinkers allow. Even insects, they
muse, could have a measure of awareness beyond the merely reflexive. The
naturalist Jakob von Uexkull wrote, 'When the dog runs, the dog moves its
legs. When the sea urchin runs, the legs move the sea urchin.'
But Sagan and Druyan are not so sure. After describing the astounding
engineering skills of the spider, they remark, 'she spins her web now. She
reaps the reward later, perhaps much later. Does she know what she's waiting
for? Does she dream of succulent moths and foolish mayflies? Or does she
wait with her mind a blank?' Such innocuous-seeming questions prompt others
that are among philosophy's deepest.
Analogy presents the authors with their most dangerous temptation. Parallels
between animal and human characteristics can enlighten remarkably, but also
mislead. Yet although they sometimes tread close to the edge, Sagan and
Druyan are alert to the risks, and indeed end the book by warning against
them. One is left with a strong sense that what underlies their remarkably
skilful and accessible account is high scientific competence. It is this
which makes their book so good.
