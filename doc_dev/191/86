Although I doubt whether Howard Goodall's new musical will make it to the
top, it is worth going to see if only to ponder on that narrow line between
success and near miss. It is not that the subject matter is wrong, though it
is slightly peculiar and nowadays in danger of seeming out-dated.
Days of Hope revolves round a young Englishman who goes to Spain to fight
for the anti-Franco forces during the Spanish civil war, and takes his bride
and part of her family back to his home town of Scarborough when Franco is
victorious. Apart from a brief prologue, all the action takes place in
Spain. The significance of Scarborough is that it used to be a regular base
for the Labour Party conference. I rather liked the juxtaposition. It is
not, on the face of it, a more unpromising subject for a musical than, say,
post-Peron Argentina.
The difficulties lie elsewhere. A good musical is unmistakeably a musical,
not just a play with songs. Days of Hope falls between stools.
Half of it is a rather straight play, wandering between the melodramatic and
the corny, written by Renata Allen. The other half includes some very good
numbers, but the dialogue seldom leads naturally into the singing.
Part of the fault in the Hampstead production may stem from the direction by
John Retallack of the Oxford Stage Company.
The Hampstead Theatre has a small stage, but not so small as to dictate that
practically every time a musical number begins the participants have to get
into a horizontal line. Retallack could learn something about deployment of
resources by looking at the versatility of some of the productions at the
Gate Theatre in Notting Hill, which has an even smaller stage.
Having his characters stand in line only emphasises the somewhat stilted
nature of the piece.
The small size of the place detracts in another way. The orchestra consists
only of a piano and two guitars, shoved off at the side. It is interesting
to reflect how a try-out production of Evita would have looked in such
circumstances. For the most striking point about Days of Hope is that some
of the music and lyrics, both written by Goodall, are pretty good. It is not
inconceivable that, given better staging and a fuller instrumental back-up,
they would rank alongside those of established successes.
Take Viva la Muerte, for example, which is a powerful revolutionary song. So
are some of the others, including the one which gives its title to the
musical. They have catchy tunes and not bad lyrics. As we know from the rain
on the plain, there are plenty of words to rhyme with Spain.
Somewhere there is a better musical lurking to get out than the one in the
Hampstead production.
Even with its imperfections, I could think of worse ways to spend an evening
in the theatre.
