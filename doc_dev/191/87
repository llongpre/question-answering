  [Text] Zenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 1 (AFP) -- 
Humanitarian groups in Zenica have introduced drastic security 
measures to protect aid workers following the murder of a 
British aid worker believed to have been killed by Islamic 
fundamentalist mercenaries. 
  Aid workers have also reported thefts and problems with 
local 
people driven to desperation through hunger and hardship. One 
aid worker said the situation in the central Bosnia Moslem 
enclave was getting like Somalia where food aid has been 
routinely looted by armed gangs. 
  In response to a request from the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) a contingent of UN British 
troops moved into Zenica from their nearby base of Vitez on 
Friday to reassure members of non-governmental organisations 
(NGO). 
  On Thursday [27 January] night, Paul Goodall, Simon King and 
David Court, all three employed by the British 
government-sponsored Overseas Development Agency were kidnapped 
at gunpoint while driving in Zenica. 
  They were taken to a spot outside the town where Paul 
Goodall, a father of four, was shot dead and the other two were 
wounded as they jumped into an icy river to escape. 
  Three men believed to have been among the killers were shot 
dead Monday by Bosnian military police when they tried to break 
through a road block near Sarajevo. 
  They were described as being of Arab appearance with false 
Pakistani passports. Another three suspected Islamic 
"muhajedeen" mercenaries are being questioned by police in 
Zenica. 
  "It's a terrorist act. It's obvious that murder was the 
intention and it's frightening," said Larry Hollingworth, the 
leader of the UNHCR delegation in Zenica. 
  "For the first 24 hours, moral was very low among the NGOs. 
So we asked for a military presence to be here," he said. 
  Hollingworth said aid workers have been warned to take more 
precautions and to stay together. "We gave new instructions but 
they are free to do what they want. I don't want people to go 
alone into isolated villages. I want them to go out in groups, 
to stay in at night unless they have an escort." 
  "I don't know who wants to stop us but that is the line some 
groups are taking," Hollingworth said, adding: "There are 
various elements here who are not under (Bosnian) government 
control." 
  Sources in Zenica said between 200 and 300 Moslem 
"mujahedeen" or holy warriors were based in Zenica and the 
surrounding countryside. They have taken an active part in 
fighting Croat forces and their influence over the local 
population is growing. 
  "We had to move out of a house where he had planned to stay 
because of threats from one of the mujahedeen who came and told 
us to get out because we were too close to one of their bases," 
said Francisco Guevarra a French nurse with the Medecins du 
Monde medical charity in Zenica. 
  "The local people are scared of them and we avoid them as 
much as possible," he added. 
  But the presence of the Islamic mercenaries is not the only 
reason why aid workers are becoming more security-conscious. 
  As supplies of food and other items run out, thefts have 
increased, with international organisations becoming prime 
targets. 
  "In three weeks, we have been attacked nine times with 
garage 
break-ins, burglaries of homes, diesel fuel stolen from vehicle 
tanks," said Laure Bonnevie an administrator with the 
Pharmaciens sans Frontieres organisation which deals in medical 
supplies. 
  "People are hungry and will get more aggressive as time goes 
on," she said. 
  "We are already taking maximum precautions. The only thing 
we haven't done is hire bodyguards, and that we will not do," 
said Jean-Francois Delimoges of Medecins du Monde (doctors of 
the world). 
  Gilles Groizeleau of the French charity Equilibre was 
pessimistic. "We now have to employ policemen and private 
security guards to protect our warehouses and residence. We are 
slowly sliding towards a Somalia-type situation." 
  In the neighbouring town of Kakanj an angry crowd blocked 
convoys several times last week and six Bosnian policemen were 
shot and wounded in the turmoil. 
  "We'll achieve less than 20 percent of the needs in January. 
All this helps to promote civil unrest. A lot of civil unrest 
is because people are hungry," said Hollingworth. 
  "If we can get a lot of food here, we can remove one of the 
major causes (of unrest). But the number of people who need to 
be fed increases every single day and means to achieving it get 
worse every day."
