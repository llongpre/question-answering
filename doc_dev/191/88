   State officials vowed they would fare better
on their next visit to a potential radioactive waste dump site
after they were chased and cornered for five hours Wednesday by
anti-dump protesters.
   More than 100 dump opponents scored a moral, if not
psychological victory, when they demanded police arrest them, or
the members of a scouting team from the state Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Siting Commission, for trespassing.
   The commission's field teams were on a walking tour of the
proposed site in the town of Allen when they were spotted around
noon by more than 100 dump opponents, according to protest
organizer Stuart Campbell.
   The protesters tracked footprints left by the seven state
officials as they ran up and down hills in the wooded area before
catching them on a county road and surrounding them with a human
chain, said Allegany County Sheriff Lawrence Scholes.
   The officials were released some five hours later after the
owner of the land they were surveying filed a trespassing complaint
against them.
   Meanwhile, 100 miles to the east, 20 protesters were arrested in
Cortland County for disorderly conduct after they refused to allow
a state inspection team to leave one of two potential sites there,
according to a sheriff's department dispatcher.
   In Allen, Scholes said the protesters ignored warnings to stay
away from the proposed site and camped out there overnight.
   The dump opponents said the state officials were on private
property and the owner was never told the team would be there to
inspect his land.
   ``Either you arrest them or you arrest us,'' Sally Campbell of
the Allegany County Nonviolent Action Group told the officers.
   William Giovanniello, the owner of the property, said state
officials did not have his permission to be on his land. ``They
never notified me _ no phone call, no nothing,'' he said.
   Siting commission staff member Bruce Goodale called
Giovanniello's claim ``sheer nonsense.''
   After Giovanniello filed a written complaint against the state,
the dump opponents allowed the officials to leave.
   As they did, the group howled and yelled, ``See you in the
morning.'' Protesters vowed they would again block commission
members from inspecting the other two possible dump sites in the
county.
   Goodale promised his group would return.
   ``They may feel it is,'' a moral or psychological victory, said
Jay Dunkleberger, executive director of the commission, who visited
the Cortland County site Wednesday. ``I consider it a draw. We did
accomplish the task we set for ourselves for the day.''
   Commission officials in the Cortland County town of Taylor had
to be escorted two miles after protesters there formed a human
chain and pinned them in their cars.
   The anti-dump group sent cars, trucks and tractors to the site
Wednesday morning after members who have been watching the two
Taylor sites around the clock reported the state field crew's
arrival, said Taffy Rook, a spokeswoman for Citizens Against
Radioactive Dumping.
   At one point, three state officials and several deputies were
``trapped'' in the woods by protesters who had blocked all roads
leading to the site, Rook said.
   Mary Gardner Smith, a spokeswoman for Concerned Citizens of
Allegany County, said about 20 protesters camped out overnight in
freezing temperatures at two of the three Allegany sites to block
state officials from beginning inspections on land there. They were
joined by other protesters at daybreak, she said.
   Siting Commission officials said they hoped to start testing
possible sites after the deer hunting season ended Tuesday.
   ``I hope that people don't go outside the law,'' said Susan
Baranski, a spokeswoman for the commission. ``The courts have made
it clear that the commission has the right and responsibility to do
this.''
   Anti-dump groups in Allegany and Cortland counties have promised
to prevent the testing from taking place. The groups said their
protests would be nonviolent but said they expected arrests.
   The five possible sites were chosen by the commission in
September. Under federal law, states must have a place to store
low-level radioactive waste by 1993.
   The commission plans to complete soil testing and other
evaluations by spring. The commission will then narrow down the
number of sites to two or three for more comprehensive tests.
