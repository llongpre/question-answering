of things to come - Personal Numbers / One day, everyone may be given a
telecoms number at birth, as they get a national insurance number today

BY THE turn of the century, business cards listing a veritable directory of
phone and fax numbers could be a thing of the past.
Instead, most business people may have just one number - a 'personal number'
connecting callers to whichever telephone, fax or messaging service its
'owner' chooses at any given time.
Eventually, everyone might get a telecoms number at birth, just as in the UK
they are given a national insurance number today, but for the foreseeable
future 'personal numbering' will be a premium-rate service, geared mainly at
companies, executives and others on the move and wanting to be contactable
anywhere, anytime.
The technology for the task is largely in place, with the development of
intelligent networks which can 'recognise' different types of call, refer to
databases, and then direct calls - and charge for them - in a pre-determined
fashion.
There is strong support for personal numbering from regulatory authorities,
which are keen to boost competition between operators to provide new
value-added services. In the UK, Oftel, the industry regulator, proposes to
devote a large block of numbers for personal numbering. Prefixed by the
digits '07', they would come on stream when the existing numbering regime is
reformed in 1995.
A recent Oftel policy statement highlighted personal numbering 'an area of
rapid growth' in the next few years. It pointed to the US, where AT&amp;T has
launched a service using '700' numbers and the Federal Communications
Commission has floated the idea that the '500' number range be generally
used for personal communications services.
The expense of the operation is widely thought to make it unviable. When
Oftel published its statement on numbering this summer, a BT spokesman
dismissed the idea as 'way, way off . . . It's like Concorde,' he said. 'You
can build it, but that doesn't mean many people will be able to afford to
fly in it.'
With a Dollars 7 a month subscription, AT&amp;T's 'EasyReach' service is not
unduly expensive. Two companies are planning to launch similar services in
the UK - Goodall Personal Numbering (GPN), which will brand a personal
numbering service under the name 'Flextel' from the end of this year; and
'Numbering Viewed Worldwide', which plans to enter the market next year.
Neither is toying with tariffs that will unduly frighten those anxious for
their services.
Goodall has two separate services in mind. First, a 'low mobility' service
geared at companies which want a single number they can keep when they move.
Second, a 'high mobility' personal number which individuals can take around
with them day by day. Numbering Viewed Worldwide will concentrate on the
second service. Mr Will Goodall, GPN's founder, believes the low mobility
services will have most impact in the short term - 'the damage done to
businesses by number changes is enormous,' he says. 'Many will be prepared
to pay a small premium for the security of being able to move all or part of
their operation around without forfeiting their number.'
He downplays the immediate potential of 'high mobility' services. 'If people
want day-by-day number portability, cellular services are doing most of the
job already,' he says.
In any case, there are serious practical difficulties in making a 'high
mobility' service viable. They are highlighted by Dr Michael Grant of
Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy.
The key problem is to find a quick and simple way for the 'owner' of the
database to update it with his/her movements on a day-by-day basis. AT&amp;T's
'EasyReach' relies on real-time updating, requiring users to phone a
database each time they want their number transferred - unless they follow a
pre-set daily pattern. This can be an off-putting process.
As Dr Grant says of existing solutions: 'The user is required to inform the
system of home, office and mobile telephone numbers, manage a list of
preferred and barred caller numbers, specify re-routing times, and make ad
hoc changes to the profile as the daily work pattern changes from its normal
routine.'
Moreover, 'informing the system' generally requires a phone call, the
entering of an account code and PIN number and then the number of the
terminal on which the user wishes to register.
THE search is on for new technological solutions to the problem. Dr Grant
highlights five which have potential:
Calling line identification, being introduced in many networks around the
world, which greatly reduces the time taken to register on a terminal.
The DTMF 'tone card' concept, which could automate both the dialling of the
service provider and the entering of the account number.
Voice recognition, which could be used to speed up the inter-action.
Subscriber identity module (SIM) cards - as already with phones on GSM
digital cellular networks - which could be used to separate handsets from
numbers, making all handsets docking stations for mobile terminals.
Turning phones 'on' and 'off', to give signals to the network - as, again,
do mobile phones already - as to whether the subscriber is there, and
routing calls accordingly.
Of the five, the SIM concept is the most path-breaking. Once the people, not
the phones, have the numbers, the era of mobile communications will have
truly arrived.
