   Do not despair. The world is not coming to an
end. Individuals can make it a better place. That's the good news
these days from public television.
   Still, you're in no immediate danger of contracting that warm,
fuzzy feeling from programs like ``Local Heroes, Global Change,'' a
four-part documentary series opening on PBS tonight.
   ``What we have learned is that the world is extremely complex,
messy, that simple solutions and slogans don't work,'' said
Francisco Sagasti, head of strategic planning for the World Bank in
Washington.
   ``Local Heroes'' is one of a number of programs on public TV
trying to show what smart, committed people can do against hunger,
poverty and pollution, especially in developing nations.
   Using these people, PBS programmers and independent producers
can relate complex stories without oversimplifying them.
   ``There's been a lot of talk among programmers about doing news
from the bottom up rather than the top down,'' said Harry Chancey,
top programmer for PBS affiliate WNET in New York City. ``There's a
sense of excitement about letting the unremarkable people tell the
story.''
   The first episode of ``Local Heroes, Global Change'' considers
rice farming in Indonesia, where farmers learned that ecologically
balanced insect populations could supplant the government's
disastrous pesticide program.
   It also looks at a near-revolutionary loan program of the
Grameen (Rural) Bank of Bangladesh, which targets women and the
landless for loans to buy livestock and homes.
   The other episodes of the South Carolina ETV series will
consider the influences of politics, psychology and the global
economy on Third World development.
   The PBS series ``Profiles in Progress'' also focuses on local
heroes. A recent episode profiled Nepal, where deforestation and
infant mortality are interconnected issues of national survival.
   Nepal's infant mortality rate 20 years ago was 250 per 1,000
live births. Today, at 110 per thousand, it's still one of the
highest in the world. Yet the decrease and a traditionally high
birth rate have helped increase Nepal's population more than 50
percent since 1970, to 17 million people.
   That population puts pressure on the forests, the traditional
source of fuel and fodder. Since 1970, Nepal has lost one-third of
its forest, or 6 million acres of trees. Deforestation robs Nepal
of soil, beauty and, ultimately, the tourism that is a main source
of its foreign exchange.
   Its local heroes are Prabhakar Rana, a hotelier who pushes for
national game preserves and local forest management, and Dr. Yagya
Karki, a health official who produces videos on prenatal care and
midwifery, and enlists village women as advocates for family
planning.
   We can expect to see many more ``local heroes'' on PBS in the
weeks and months ahead. In October, Boston's WGBH will be offering
a 10-part series called ``The Race to Save the Planet.''
   Another kind of ``local hero'' is naturalist Jane Goodall, whose
30-year study of the chimpanzees of Tanzania's Gombe National Park
has expanded our understanding of human's closest relative.
   ``It's being there with the chimpanzees, being out of the rat
race, that gives me the energy to travel around lecturing and
meeting people,'' she says on HBO's documentary ``Chimps: So Like
Us,'' which airs on May 9.
   It's a beautifully photographed documentary on her work and her
deeply felt opposition to the inhumane use of chimps in medical
research.
   On May 20, TBS and the award-winning ``National Geographic
Explorer'' present ``The Life and Legend of Jane Goodall.''
   A little good news never hurt anybody.

   Elsewhere In Television ...
   THE DISMAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT: ``Fear, Greed and the Madness of
Crowds'' is a funny, insightful and visually delightful examination
by ``Adam Smith's Money World'' at the irrational behavior of
markets over the centuries.
   It covers such egregious examples of economic fancy as the
tulipmania of 17th-century Holland, the South Sea bubble in
18th-century England and the Florida land boom of the '20s.
   Its droll, eye-popping graphics were designed on the Quantel
Paintbox by Emmy Award-winning co-producer John Andrews, with
artists Todd Ruff and Sharon Haskell. Its first PBS air date is May
11, but check local listings.
