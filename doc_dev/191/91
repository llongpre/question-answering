   American scientists today said they will
join Vietnamese archeologists in a remote cave outside Hanoi to
search for remains of the largest known ape _ a 9-foot primate that
became extinct 200,000 years ago.
   The excavation, planned for Jan. 4-28, is being billed as the
first field research project involving scientists of the two
countries since the beginning of the war in Indochina.
   Paleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon said he and three other
Americans would join about 10 Vietnamese scientists at the limestone
cave where remains have been found of the ``Gigantopithecus,'' an
ape known only from sites in southern China and Vietnam.
   Despite some earlier research by Vietnamese, East German and
French scientists, very little is known about the giant, which is
related to the orangutan, chimpanzee and gorilla.
   Only jawbones and teeth of the animal have been uncovered but
Ciochon said the team hoped to find more remains in the cave, 75
miles southwest of Hanoi, which served as a weapons depot and bomb
shelter during the Vietnam War.
   ``One thing we know about it is that it was very big,'' Ciochon
told reporters. It was probably a four-footed, vegetarian animal
weighing about 770 pounds that became extinct 200,000 to 300,000
years ago, the Americans said.
   There is speculation early man may have hunted the ape to
extinction. The team hopes to establish relationships between ``homo
erectus,'' the direct ancestor of modern humans, stone tools used by
early man and the giant ape since the remains of all three have been
found in the area of the cave.
   Ciochon, from the University of Iowa, said the Americans were
bringing in special rock saws and generators for the excavation. He
said these would be turned over to Vietnamese counterparts when the
Americans returned home.
   Two Vietnamese scientists are to visit the United States later,
bringing fossils from the excavation site.
   The National Geographic Society, which is sending a team to
Vietnam to film a documentary on the excavation, is the main backer
of the expedition.
   Although the United States and Vietnam have no diplomatic
relations, informal exchanges have increased the past two years.
However, Hanoi permits far more American academics, journalists and
others to visit Vietnam than Washington does Vietnamese to enter the
United States.
   Ciochon said members of his team had visited Vietnam in 1987 and
1988 for preliminary surveys.
   Ciochon said research on the Gigantopithecus in China has been
hampered by site disturbances: remains of the ape have been ground
up to be sold as medicine.
   In Vietnam, he said, this practice does not exist and the
potential of finding substantial fossil remains is considerable.
   Other American members of the expedition are Ms. K. Semendeferi
of the University of Iowa and John Olsen and Mary Kay Gilliland
Olsen of the University of Arizona. The Vietnamese scientists come
from the Institute of Archaeology in Hanoi.
