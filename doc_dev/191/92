   New York state officials say that based on new
and ``extensive'' evidence of wrongdoing by New York Telephone, the
Federal Communications Commission should reconsider a consent
decree that ended its investigation of the New York and New England
Telephone companies.
   In a filing scheduled for delivery Monday to the FCC, Robert
Abrams, the state attorney general, and Richard Kessel, executive
director of the New York Consumer Protection Board, said New York
Telephone's violations of commission rules on affiliate
transactions ``was far more extensive and had a far greater effect
on NYT's rates than the commission believed when it adopted the
consent decree.''
   A copy of the filing made available to The Associated Press on
Friday also said the FCC had not given an explanation for agreeing
to the consent decree and that it had foreclosed participation by
New York authorities into the investigation of the two Nynex Corp.
subsidiaries.
   On Oct. 4, the FCC announced that the two telephone companies
had agreed to make voluntary contributions totaling $1.4 million to
the U.S. Treasury. They also agreed to cut their long-distance
rates $35.5 million to resolve allegations that they overcharged
customers through a Nynex subsidiary, Materiel Enterprises Co.
   In exchange, the FCC ended its investigation without finding any
wrongdoing.
   The FCC in February had said it intended to fine the two
telephone companies $1.4 million - a record amount - over apparent
violations of FCC rules governing transactions between regulated
telephone companies and unregulated affiliates.
   The FCC had ordered the companies to return $35.5 million to
long-distance customers because of alleged $118.5 million in
overcharges to NYT and NET by Nynex Materiel Enterprises Co.
(MECO), an unregulated Nynex purchasing subsidiary.
   The companies agreed to the $35.5 million rebate, to be made
within 30 days, and also said they would reduce their capital
accounts by $32.6 million to ``remove the alleged excess profits on
plant and equipment purchased from MECO.''
   Local phone rates were not be affected by the rebates.
   A few days before the FCC consent decree, New York state utility
regulators authorized a study into whether Nynex should be forced
to divest New York Telephone.
   The new filing said evidence submitted during a rate increase
proceeding show that FCC methodology ``vastly understates the
unjust and unreasonable charges ultimately passed on to New York
consumers in their interstate rates.''
   As a result, New York long-distance ratepayers ``have paid rates
inflated by NYT's imprudent overpayments to MECO and other Nynex
unregulated affiliates.''
   An FCC spokeswoman, Audrey Spivack, said the commission had not
seen the filing and could not comment.
   Nynex spokesman Peter Goodale said by telephone from New York
that he had not seen the filing and could not respond to specifics.
But he noted that the telephone companies already had taken steps
to comply with th consent decree, including making the $1.4
million payment to the Treasury.
   ``We've upheld our end of the bargain and we hope the FCC does
as well,'' Goodale said.
