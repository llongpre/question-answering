   Dr. Jonas Salk's report that an experimental
vaccine eliminated AIDS infection in two chimpanzees demonstrates
treatment for the deadly disease is possible, but scientists say it
is only one of several promising findings.
   ``These are the beginnings of progress we didn't have a year
ago,'' said Dani Bolognesi of Duke University, a leading authority
on AIDS vaccine research.
   Speaking Thursday at the Fifth International Conference on AIDS,
Bolognesi said researchers at the New England Primate Research
Center had blocked an AIDS-like infection in monkeys.
   And researchers at Repligen in Cambridge, Mass., working with
Bolognesi and others, showed that antibodies to a tiny portion of
the AIDS virus's outer surface could prevent infection in
chimpanzees.
   Much of the attention at the conference focused on Salk,
developer of the first polio vaccine in the 1950's. Salk himself
said, however, that his research did not constitute a breakthrough.
   ``We're on a path we think is worth pursuing,'' Salk said. ``We
haven't reached the end of it ... We're still in the exploratory
phase.''
   Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, one of the
discoverers of the AIDS virus, said Salk's vaccine could probably
never be given to people who had not already been infected by the
AIDS virus.
   The reason, he said, is that the vaccine is made of killed _ but
mostly intact _ AIDS virus.
   ``Who would take it? Who's going to guarantee that every virus
particle is dead?'' Gallo said. He noted that the Salk polio
vaccine, also made of killed virus, did in some cases give people
polio when it was processed incorrectly.
   He said it was unlikely the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
would ever approve such a vaccine for use in uninfected people to
prevent acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``There is no Salk AIDS vaccine here,'' Gallo said.
   Bolognesi, who summed up vaccine research at the AIDS conference,
did say, however, that Salk had made several intriguing and
surprising findings.
   In one study, Salk and Clarence Gibbs of the U.S. National
Institutes of Health injected four chimpanzees with high doses of
the AIDS virus, called the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Two
had already been infected with AIDS and then vaccinated.
   A third had been vaccinated but not previously infected with
AIDS. A fourth was not vaccinated or infected.
   The two that had been infected and vaccinated fought off the new
infection. The vaccine worked.
   ``This in itself is a remarkable finding,'' Bolognesi said.
Before that, the consensus had been ``that once you are infected
with HIV you are infected for life,'' he said.
   ``I'm encouraged by what appears to be a rather powerful effect
on an existing infection.''
   The chimp that was vaccinated but not previously infected
developed an infection when given a high dose of AIDS virus, but
that infection is slowly subsiding, Salk said.
   The fourth chimp, which was not vaccinated, developed an ongoing
AIDS infection after being injected with HIV.
   Salk also tested his vaccine on 19 patients with AIDS-related
complex or ARC, a condition that often precedes AIDS. The results
were less encouraging than those in the chimpanzees.
   The 19 patients have remained stable for a year without taking
AZT or other drugs, said one of Salk's collaborators, Dr. Alexandra
Levine of the University of Southern California.
   The studies showed the vaccine was not toxic and that it could
boost the patients' immune reponse to the AIDS virus.
   Injections of bits of the AIDS virus under the patients' skins
showed that they had developed what's called ``cellular immunity''
to AIDS. That is, not only did they fight it with antibodies, they
also fought it with certain white blood cells intended to defend
against infections.
   After the third boosters, more than half of the subjects
demonstrated this cellular immunity, Levine said. But the vaccine
did not eliminate infection in any of them, as it did in the
chimpanzees.
   Salk said he hoped the vaccine might protect against illness by
limiting the infection, even if it doesn't prevent it.
   Gallo said chimpanzees are naturally more resistant to the AIDS
virus than are humans. Success with them therefore might not
translate to humans.
