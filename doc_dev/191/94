   diet high in vitamin-deficient white rice, a researcher suggested
Thursday.
   Ronald Munger, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of
Minnesota's division of epidemiology, said his studies show that
stress is not the leading cause of Sudden Unexpected Death
Syndrome, as some experts have said.
   Munger, 34, presented his findings Thursday to a conference of
the Society for Epidemiologic Research in Vancouver, Br humans and monkeys
both
received the virus from a common ancestor. Monkeys and humans are
descendants of primates who lived 20 million to 30 million years
ago.
   The report on African green monkeys by Hayami's team was
published in Nature, a British scientific journal, earlier this
month. Carel Mulder, a University of Massachusetts biologist, in a
separate commentary in Nature, said the findings mean ``the human
viruses cannot have originated from African monkeys in recent
times, as had been predicted by many people.''
   Hayami says many diseases that afflict humans came from animals,
so it was not unreasonable to theorize that AIDS did as well.
   His complete genetic sequencing of the green monkey virus
determined that the simian and human viruses were different. The
sequencing involved checking by hand 9,000 base pairs of nucleic
acids _ the building blocks of genes.
   His laboratory has not completed sequencing of the mandrill
virus yet, but hybridization, another test, shows it is different
from human viruses and the African green monkey virus, Hayami said.
   ``SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) mandrill is really we
think an authentic mandrill virus, not from another species,''
Hayami said.
   The most intriguing aspect of the two simian viruses is that
neither produces illness in the animals that host them. Examining
why the simian virus does not produce illness could lead ``to a
strategy for producing a vaccine'' to prevent AIDS in humans,
Hayami said.
   Because the African green monkey virus has been fully
genetically analyzed, it can be compared with the human virus.
Hayami's laboratory has found that the human virus has an ``R''
gene, which is missing in the simian virus.
   He said his laboratory staff has already begun ``constructing a
recombinant clone of the African green monkey cirus with an `R'
gene. We are going to test it to try to induce AIDS.''
   Hayami said, ``At this moment, nobody knows the function of this
gene. If we prove the `R' gene is responsible for pathogenicity
that is very important. We can have the weapon to attack the human
virus. But that is only my dream.''
   Meanwhile, work is continuing on the full genetic sequencing of
the mandrill virus.
   The virus was found in two mandrills living in the primate
center's forested enclosure. Both were born in the wild and
captured and brought to the Franceville center, a $30 million
facility built with Gabon's oil earnings to study infertility. In
recent years in it has focused on AIDS research.
   In April, other scientists at the center claimed to have found
two chimpanzees with an AIDS virus. If confirmed, it will be the
first time chimpanzees have been found with the disease.
   As chimpanzees are a closer relative of humans than monkeys,
this could be another important step for AIDs research.
