   A biotechnology company that nearly gave up
looking for an AIDS vaccine three years ago now says it has made a
vaccine that protected chimpanzees from the human AIDS virus.
   ``Our scientists just didn't give up,'' Jack Murphy, spokesman
for Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, said Friday.
   ``We have fairly high hopes for this, but it will take years to
develop anything that could protect humans from AIDS,'' Murphy said.
``This, right now, is more of a scientific development and certainly
not a breakthrough.''
   Dr. Daniel F. Hoth, who directs the AIDS division at the National
Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.,
called the Genentech findings ``a potentially very important step.''
   ``It's another brick in the wall we are building to show that an
AIDS vaccine is feasible,'' Hoth said.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must approve the vaccine
for testing on humans before further research can begin, Genentech
officials said.
   The company had virtually abandoned similar research in 1987
after making no headway. Until recently, researchers were only able
to protect chimpanzees from a simian form of the AIDS virus, but not
the human virus itself, Murphy said.
   The Genentech vaccine is among several being developed in hopes
of finding a way protect people from contracting acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, which leaves victims vulnerable to deadly
cancers and ailments.
   More than 80,000 Americans have died from AIDS since it was first
reported in the early 1980s.
   Vaccines don't cure a disease, but prevent those who have been
vaccinated from becoming infected.
   The Genentech vaccine is genetically engineered, as are two other
vaccines the FDA has approved for testing in people to protect them
against the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.
   One of the vaccines, approved for testing in August 1987, was
developed by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn. The second,
developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb Co., of New York, was approved for
human trials in November 1987.
   Dr. Jonas Salk, who developed a vaccine for polio, also is
testing an experimental vaccine made from inactivated AIDS viruses
that are replicated and don't contain anything that could be
infectious.
   ``The hardest part about developing these vaccines is they're
very specific and work against only one type of virus,'' Murphy
said. Eventually, he said, a vaccine must be developed that protects
against all strains of the disease.
   Phillip W. Berman of Genentech and Jorg Eichberg of the Southwest
Biomedical Research Center of San Antonio, Texas, developed the
Genentech vaccine for chimpanzees that were housed in Texas during
the experiment.
   The research is to be published in the June 14 issue of the
British medical journal Nature. Genentech got permission from the
journal to announce the findings early so it could be reported at
the company's upcoming annual shareholders' meeting on June 8.
   In the experiment, two chimpanzees immunized with the
experimental vaccine and then injected with the HIV virus remained
healthy six months afterward. An unvaccinated chimp became infected
within seven weeks, the researchers said.
