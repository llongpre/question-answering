The government has declared wild chimpanzees an endangered species, a move that 
will provide additional federal protection for man's closest relative, 
officials confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had classified the primate as a "threatened" 
species, but officials said that more protection was needed in view of recent 
studies documenting a drastic decline in the populations of wild chimps in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The endangered status designation was also extended to the pygmy chimpanzee, 
which, despite its name, is about the same size as the chimpanzee. 
</P>
<P>
The chimpanzee has disappeared from five of the 25 African countries that 
represent its historic range, and its population has fallen from a high of 
about 2 million to a current estimate of 175,000 because of overhunting and 
loss of habitat to man. 
</P>
<P>
The pygmy chimpanzee lives only in Zaire, and experts estimate its population 
at 15,000.
