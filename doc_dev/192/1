   Princess Diana, her two sons, mother and two
sisters flew to Antigua today for a weeklong vacation in the
Caribbean.
   Police and bodyguards kept photographers from taking pictures of
Diana, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4, as they boarded a
British Airways flight at Heathrow Airport.
   The princess and her children were traveling with her mother,
Frances Shand-Kydd, and sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady
Jane Fellowes.
   A spokesman at the Antigua and Barbuda High Commission in London,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the princess and her
family were headed for the island of Tortola in the British Virgin
Islands. Buckingham Palace said it could not confirm the report.
   ``This is a private holiday treat which Mrs. Shand-Kydd has
planned for quite some time,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokesman,
who by custom was not identified.
   During Diana's last holiday in the Caribbean, on the island of
Eleuthera, photographers snapped pictures of the princess as she
sunbathed in a bikini while pregnant with Prince William.
   Diana's husband, Prince Charles, remained at the estate of his
mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in Sandringham, where the royal family
celebrated the holidays.
