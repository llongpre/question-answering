<TEXT>
<P>
Prince Charles and Princess Diana arrived in Hong Kong today for a three-day 
official visit, possibly the last by British royalty before the colony reverts 
to China in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
All air traffic was halted before the royal flight touched down at Kai Tak 
Airport, which has one of the world's most spectacular runways, jutting out 
into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Charles is expected to hear the concerns of Chinese in Hong Kong who are 
worried about their future under Beijing sovereignty. Local fears have been 
heightened by the crushing in June of China's pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been scheduled to visit China, but the trip was canceled after 
the brutal crackdown in Beijing, and they went to Indonesia instead after a 
last-minute invitation by President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Houston the Duchess of York ended a five-day visit to Texas with 
a visit to an inner-city school where she took part in a day filled with 
anti-drug messages. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old former Sarah Ferguson was also serenaded by more than 600 
pupils at Blackshear Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The duchess, who is married to Britain's Prince Andrew, came to Houston on 
Thursday at the invitation of the Houston Grand Opera, which is saluting 300 
years of British opera.
