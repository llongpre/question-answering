   Princess Diana is a spunky, bewitchingly natural
young woman with a magnetic charge of glamour that has dragged the
sleepy British monarchy into the age of mass media, according to a
published report.
   And the future queen likes to wear glitzy costume jewelry as
much as the real thing, according to a special issue of People
magazine, released for previews Sunday. The issue is titled ``All
About Diana: The Private World of a Princess.''
   People reports that Princess Di, who turns 27 on July 1, enjoys
a royal family fortune of $680 million. With this wealth comes a
personal collection of jewelry estimated at about $1.5 million and
use of cars that include a Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Bentley. She and
Prince Charles have an annual income of about $3 million and four
royal homes.
   The one woman Diana trusts most, the magazine reports, is her
mother, Frances Shand Kydd, 52.
   People reports that Diana enjoys greeting her sons at the palace
when they arrive home from school and reading them bedtime stories.
   While Prince Charles often spends the evening working in his
study, Diana watches her favorite television soap operas.

   Frank Zamboni, the man who made his name a
household word in hockey country, fittingly received his first
honorary degree from Clarkson University, an NCAA Division I hockey
power in upstate New York.
   Zamboni, 87, inventor of the ice resurfacing machine that bears
his name, was awarded an honorary doctor of engineering degree at
the university's commencement exercises Sunday.
   ``He's very important to us here in the North Country,'' said
Clark Bailey, assistant to acting Clarkson president R. Thomas
Williamson.
   Bailey nominated Zamboni, a man with a ninth grade education,
for the doctorate.
   ``I felt that this guy epitomized the work ethic,'' said Bailey.
   Zamboni, a Utah native, invented the machine in 1949 while
operating a California ice skating rink. The machine greatly
reduced the time needed to resurface the ice.

   Estelle Getty, one of television's
``Golden Girls,'' says her cause is the aging of America.
   Because of death, illness or divorce, many women suddenly find
they ``have to face the world alone. The world is not Noah's Ark,
and people can get by without walking two by two,'' Ms. Getty said.
   She also said she doesn't like to get specific about either her
age or her height.
   ``Don't ask me how tall I am. That's one question I don't
answer,'' the diminutive co-star of the ``Golden Girls'' situation
comedy told an audience of 300 people Sunday at a women's health
day speech at McLeod Regional Medical Center.
   ``We're all the same age,'' said Ms. Getty, who's a little under
5 feet tall and a little over 60.
   She says the living arrangement on her television show, in which
older women share a home, is ``independence through
interdependence.'' Her housemates have private bedrooms and
bathrooms but share in a household community.
   Ms. Getty is planning to publish this fall a book _ titled ``If
I Knew Then What I Know Now, So What'' _ on her observations and
philosophy from 40 years of marriage and two sons.
   ``Women marry men thinking they're going to change them, and
they never do,'' she said. ``Men marry women hoping they will never
change, but they invariably do.''

   The Dalai Lama says he's content with his simple
and meditative life, but he recognizes the historic importance of
greed, drive and ambition.
   ``To a certain extent, advancement and human progress come from
being greedy ... With too much contentment, nothing gets done,''
the Dalai Lama says in an interview in the June issue of Life
magazine.
   The leader of the world's Tibetan Buddhists, who has lived in
exile in India since a rebellion against the Chinese in 1959, says
he doesn't regret not being able to exercise normal human passions.
   ``Certain people think that without love, sex, anger, they would
be lifeless,'' he said. ``To me such things make life colorful, but
also turbulent. They make life go up and down. Without extreme
feelings, life is in one way colorless, but it is very steady.''
   Asked about the role of religious leaders such as Jesse Jackson
and Pat Robertson in politics, the Dalai Lama said ``politicians
should have more spiritual experience.''
   ``That will help them to conduct politics with more moral
principle,'' he said, adding: ``The reality of a big country like
the United States is that there are many religions, many cultures.
America might not be suited to a leader from one religion.''
