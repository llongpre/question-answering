   Lord Maclean, the former chief official of Queen
Elizabeth II's household and organizer of the 1981 wedding of
Prince Charles, has died, his family announced today. He was 73.
   Maclean died Thursday at Hampton Court Palace, a former royal
residence in London, where he had been chief steward since 1985.
The announcement gave no cause of death.
   The Scottish baron became lord chamberlain in 1971. Before he
retired from the post in 1984, he had established a reputation as a
perfectionist in royal ceremonies while overseeing the queen's
household.
   The wedding of Prince Charles, the queen's eldest son, and Lady
Diana Spencer in St. Paul's Cathedral was a highlight of his term.
   In a spontaneous gesture, Princess Diana kissed him before a
train carried the newlyweds away on their honeymoon.
   Maclean served as a Scots Guards infantry officer in World War
II, fighting in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. After
the war, he became a sheep and cattle farmer.
   In 1959, he became leader of the Boy Scouts in Britain and the
Commonwealth. He went on to revolutionize the staid image of the
movement founded by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908, adding sports such
as gliding and cave diving to traditional scouting activities. He
retired as chief scout in 1975.
   Maclean's first ceremonial assignment as lord chamberlain was
the 1972 funeral of the Duke of Windsor, who as King Edward VIII
abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis
Simpson.
   The assignment was difficult because of the bad feeling
engendered by the abdication among other members of the royal
family. But Maclean was judged to have handled the funeral
arrangements with great skill.
   Royalty watchers noted with approval that Maclean did not bow
when he said farewell to the duke's widow as she left.
   Maclean also organized the silver wedding celebration of Queen
Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, that year.
   His job as lord chamberlain sometimes involved odd
responsibilities. He once had to advise the queen whether she
should keep her centuries-old legal right to possession of every
whale and sturgeon washed up on the British coast. After some
deliberation, Maclean advised her to renounce it, saying it might
prove a nuisance.
   There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.
   He is survived by his wife and their son and daughter.
