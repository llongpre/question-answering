<LEADPARA>  I HAVE never met the Queen of England, who visited the United States last
week, nor seen her in person. But on one occasion I almost knocked down her
mother, the Queen Mother.;    I was walking near St. Paul's Cathedral in
London, not particularly watching where I was going, when a limousine pulled
up to the curb and out stepped the ever-smiling Queen Mother, dainty in an
organdy dress and wide-brimmed hat.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Waving to the instant audience that gathered, she stepped onto the sidewalk
-- and I almost collided with her.;    That's the closest I've ever come to
meeting a member of the royal family, but it shows how accessible they are. If
I were determined enough, I could easily see -- if not meet -- every one of
the royals residing in London.;    Royals-watching is something like
star-watching. If you want to see a movie star in Hollywood, you go where they
are likely to appear.;    The same is true in London, only the palace makes it
easy: It publishes a monthly calendar listing the public appearances of the
royals. Among newspapers that print this list are the London Times, the
Telegraph and the Independent.;    Usually there's a royal appearance of one
kind or another every day. When I was in London a few years back, for
instance, the Duchess of York was to make a presentation at the Dulwich
Picture Galley at noon and attend an "Evening at the Races" at 7:55 p.m. at
the Savoy Hotel. Meanwhile, Princess Diana was to attend a preview of the
Chelsea Flower Show that evening.;    Such appearances are almost always
covered by London's headline-seeking tabloids, who are inveterate
royals-trackers. Some newspapers, like the Sun, have a full-time royals
reporter.;    For the general public, these appearances provide only a glimpse
of a royal personage as he or she moves from limousine to ceremony. For a more
candid -- and perhaps longer -- look at the royals, the thing to do is to hang
out at places where they are known to stay or visit.;    Prince Charles and
his family, for instance, live in London's Kensington Palace; a patient
royals-watcher may spot Princess Diana sending off sons Prince William and
Prince Henry to school in the mornings.;    Kensington Palace is also home to
several other members of the royal family, including Princess Margaret, the
Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and their three children, and Prince and
Princess Michael of Kent and their two children.;    The best place to spot
the royals at Kensington Palace is near the entrance on the side away from
Kensington Gardens Park, according to "Fodor's Royalty Watching," an excellent
guidebook that details the many places and events where the royals can be
seen.;    Unlike Buckingham Palace, where the Queen resides, parts of
Kensington Palace are open to the public. On display in the baroque state
apartments is a collection of court costumes.;    On the other hand, only the
Queen's Gallery and the Royal Mews are open to the public at stately
Buckingham Palace. The gallery displays some of the Queen's extraordinary
collection of paintings. In the mews, or stables, are the gilded state
coaches, including those used in coronations.;    Visitors also can watch the
changing-of-the-guard ceremony in the palace forecourt at 11 a.m. daily. It's
difficult to see much of this popular ritual because the heavy crowd cuts off
the view. Get there early or buy a periscope.;    The rest of the palace is
off-limits. In addition to the Queen, Buckingham is home to Prince Edward and
Princess Anne. Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York also stay here when in
town.;    It's possible to spot a royal or two coming and going at Buckingham,
but don't wait at the front gate; they use the side entrances.;    Most of the
royals also have homes outside London. Prince Charles' house in the Cotswolds
Hills is called Highgrove. Prince Andrew built a home in Sunninghill,
Berkshire, adjoining Windsor Great Park. Princess Anne has a place in Gatcombe
Park in Gloucestershire. The Queen has several castles, including Windsor and
Balmoral.;    Certain events bring out the royals. The royal enclosure at the
Royal Ascot races in June is always a good place to spot a crowned head or
two, as are the polo matches at nearby Smith's Lawn. Beware, however, of the
English tabloid photographers. They will elbow and jostle unmercifully just to
get a photo, as some of us found out one day when both Princess Diana and the
Duchess of York came to the polo matches attired in polka-dot outfits,
creating a photo frenzy.;    The Queen, of course, makes many public
appearances. One of the most colorful is the Trooping of the Color, a
celebration of the Queen's birthday held every year on the second Saturday in
June. She rides in a carriage. Other members of the royal family watch the
ceremony from the Horse Guards building.;    After the march, the Queen and
royal family gather on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a flyover by the
Royal Air Force. Camera-toting visitors equipped with a telephoto lens can
make their own souvenir photos of the royal family at this time.;    Now that
his broken arm has mended, Prince Charles is likely to resume playing polo at
Smith's Lawn, near the Ascot race course. Among the spectators may be his
father, the Duke of Edinburgh, or his wife, Princess Diana, though Di's
presence is becoming increasingly unlikely.;    Most royals watchers, however,
cherish the views they get of their distinguished targets during their less
public moments -- if, for instance, one happens to dine in the same restaurant
as Princess Diana, or spot Prince Andrew and the spirited Duchess of York in a
nightclub.;    These are chance occurrences, of course, since the royals do
not broadcast their private itineraries. But your chances of spotting a royal
are better if you visit the places where they are known to frequent.;    I
once missed seeing Princess Diana by just a day at Green's, a classy
restaurant on Duke Street in Mayfair. On a later visit there, I talked with
the manager, David Wicker.;    "Someone printed what she (Princess Diana)
dined on, so I got a letter from her lady-in-waiting, saying she was
displeased. But she's been here since." Wicker said people hardly turn their
heads when royal diners come in, and detectives don't let people approach
them.;    Other restaurants popular with members of the royal family include
Caprice, San Lorenzo, Mirabelle's, Belinsky's Balloon, Langan's Brasserie,
Annabel's Club (private), and the Clauserie in Claridge's Hotel.;    It's a
heady world the royals travel in, but it may not be as exciting as one might
think.;    A year or so ago in London, I saw a wonderful series of clips of
Princess Diana greeting person after person in a receiving line and becoming
progressively and utterly bored with it all.;    Which goes to show that for
all their pomp and circumstance, the royals are just as human as we commoners.  </TEXT>
