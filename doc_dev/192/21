</DATELINE>

Hours before the Princess of Wales stepped off the British Concorde at Kennedy 
Airport on Wednesday, one of her spokesmen tried to give an etiquette lesson to 
New York's hyper-aggressive press corps. 
</P>
<P>
"The Princess of Wales doesn't operate in every way like a President of the 
United States or like a senior political figure," Francis Cornish of the 
British Information Service, explained. 
</P>
<P>
"If people think it would be a good idea to shout questions, I can tell you 
here and now that you won't get an answer. Frankly, you're more likely to get 
the back of her head," he warned. "She will not give any interviews."

Koch Pledges Politeness 
</P>
<P>
New York's normally outspoken Mayor Edward I. Koch pledged, meanwhile, that he 
would be polite and "not rain on her parade." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a young woman who has nothing to do but represent the royal family in 
a royal way," Koch said. The mayor said that, above all, he would not bring up 
the touchy subject of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to do that," Koch told reporters. "I don't happen to agree with 
the British government's position with respect to Northern Ireland. I believe 
that the phrase 'Brits out of Ireland' still applies. But I'm not going to 
insult this young woman." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Big Apple, Lady Di. 
</P>
<P>
The princess' three-day, high-profile visit is designed to stress social causes 
and to push British products ranging from cashmere sweaters to a toy called 
Thomas the Tank Engine -- a railroad locomotive with a happy smiling face. 
</P>
<P>
Irish-American foes of British rule in Northern Ireland promised to protest the 
visit, especially when the 27-year-old princess attends the Welsh Opera's 
American premiere, a performance of "Falstaff" tonight at the Brooklyn Academy 
of Music. After the final curtain and a backstage visit with the cast, she is 
to be the honored guest at a lavish dinner in the soaring glass and steel 
Winter Garden at the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
During her visit to New York, Diana is staying in a flower-filled 
$1,800-a-night deluxe duplex hotel suite with deep red walls with its own 
solarium and terrace -- but without Prince Charles, who remains at home to hand 
out awards to a variety of Britons, including dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"The prince and princess receive several thousands of invitations a year in the 
U.K. and abroad," explained Dickie Arbiter, assistant press secretary to the 
queen. "In order to satisfy the thousands of requests that come in, they have 
to split their resources." 
</P>
<P>
Just before dinner time, smiling and looking radiant in a royal blue wool coat 
and a string of pearls, Diana arrived amid heavy security at Kennedy Airport 
and rushed off to her first stop, a reception hosted by a firm that produces 
Scottish cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
She also will promote British toy manufacturers by visiting FAO Schwarz, the 
huge 5th Avenue toy store. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will also stress social problems. Diana will tour the Henry Street 
Settlement's Urban Family Center in Lower Manhattan, a pioneering program 
serving as an alternative to welfare hotels for homeless families, and Harlem 
Hospital's pediatric AIDS unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people are pretty excited," said Fred Winters, a hospital 
spokesman. "I think all Americans are excited when they meet royalty." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the princess said that her visits to Harlem Hospital and the 
Henry Street shelter were designed to follow up some of her own social 
interests in England. 
</P>
<P>
"She is aware these are problems that loom large on the New York scene," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Prince Charles visited New York some years ago, he was picketed heavily by 
Irish-Americans protesting British rule in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Nassau County Comptroller Peter King, chairman of the Committee for Legal 
Justice in Northern Ireland, said he would lead similar protests outside the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music.
