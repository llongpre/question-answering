<P>
A royal jet carrying Princess Diana was forced to make an emergency landing 
today because of an electrical problem that cropped up just after takeoff on 
the first leg of a visit to Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers repaired the problem and the 28-year-old princess of Wales and her 
entourage later left on the first official visit to a Warsaw Pact nation by 
members of the House of Windsor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The first stop was to be in Ancona, Italy, where the royal party was to pick up 
Prince Charles, Diana's husband and the heir to the British throne, before 
flying on to the Hungarian capital of Budapest. Prince Charles was in Italy to 
open his first exhibition of watercolor paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The unspecified electrical fault was detected shortly after the BAE-146 
aircraft -- manned by the Queen's Flight, members of the Royal Air Force -- 
took off from London's Heathrow Airport, authorities said. The pilot 
immediately diverted to London's nearby Gatwick Airport, where the problem was 
solved. The princess and her party of about 20 remained aboard the aircraft 
while British Airways engineers fixed the problem.
