   One of London's leading bookmakers has stopped
taking bets on the sex and name of the Duchess of York's unborn
child because her husband, Prince Andrew, was quoted as saying it
will be a girl called Annabel.
   The Sun newspaper reported Friday that Andrew told a Yorkshire
cricket team about his prediction this week after the team offered
him a child's cricket bat.
   ``It won't be much use. I'm sure we are having a girl,'' the
paper quoted Andrew as saying. It said the 28-year-old prince, a
Royal Navy helicopter pilot, told the guests the baby will be
called Annabel.
   In Britain, cricket is primarily played by boys.
   The former Sarah Ferguson, who married Queen Elizabeth II's son
in July 1986, is expecting their first child in August.
   Buckingham Palace said the report that the 28-year-old duchess
was expecting a girl was just speculation.
   ``Certainly, we are not in a position to talk about the private
coversations of the Duke of York. It's all speculation,'' said a
spokeswoman, who by custom was not identified.
   But Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for bookmakers William Hill,
said: ``We decided that the reported remarks of the Duke of York
represented an ideal opportunity for us to close the book on the
sex and name of the baby.''
   Sharpe said if Andrew's quote had surfaced soon after the
duchess become pregnant, ``we might not have given it credence.''
   But now that she's six months along, he said, ``they must have a
good idea of what they would call the baby, be it male or female.
After six months, if they want to know what the sex of the baby is,
it's very easy to find out.''
   In recent weeks, he said, Annabel went from a 20-1 to 3-1
favorite.
   ``The last time anything similar happened was when we had heavy
backing for the name William to be chosen as the name of Charles
and Diana's firstborn, and of course we all know what happened
there.''
   Andrew's older brother, Prince Charles, and his wife, Princess
Diana, chose William as the name of their first son, who was born
in June 1982. William is second in line to the British throne
behind his father.
   Sharpe said William Hill had taken in about $56,000 in bets on
the name and sex of the baby.
   ``It's not as much as was bet on William, but it's more than on
Harry,'' he said. Prince Harry, the second son of Charles and
Diana, was born in September 1984.
   Sharpe said punters with an appetite for things royal would
still be able to bet on the weight of the duchess' baby and its
birth date. ``We're offering 7-1 against them being able to tell us
the date on which the baby is born,'' he said.
