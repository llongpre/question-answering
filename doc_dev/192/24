   Princess Diana's brother and his
bride exchanged wedding vows Saturday in a church where some of
George Washington's ancestors are buried.
   The marriage of Viscount Althorp and former model Victoria
Lockwood had been proclaimed ``the nearly royal wedding of the
year'' by The Sunday Times of London.
   The bride wore the Spencer family tiara that Diana wore when she
married Prince Charles in 1981.
   Like Diana's, the wedding was conducted by the archbishop of
Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert Runcie _ ``a very nice man,'' in
the opinion of the eighth Earl Spencer, father of the groom, whose
comments were included in a packet of press material on the ceremony.
   Charles and Diana were among the guests, and their second son,
five-year-old Prince Harry, was a page. Security, in deference to
the royals, was strict, and villagers needed red tickets to be
admitted to an enclosure near the church.
   Unlike the royal wedding in the vast St. Paul's Cathedral in
London, Saturday's ceremony was crammed into the medieval Church of
St. Mary the Virgin, two miles from the family seat of Althorp. Six
pews were removed to make room for an orchestra and a choir, leaving
space for about 250 guests.
   Another 200 people were invited for champagne and a light supper
afterwards at the family house. The estate stands in
Northamptonshire amid rolling pastures where sheep and cattle graze
among the hedgerows.
   Barbara Cartland, 88-year-old queen of romance novelists and
mother of the earl's second wife, arrived in a hot pink chiffon
dress and hat.
   Charles Althorp, 25, who is a reporter for NBC's ``Today'' Show,
is in line to become the ninth Earl and inherit an estimated $80
million fortune, including the Althorp estate.
   Miss Lockwood, 24, a former fashion model, became engaged to
Althorp in July following a six-week romance.
   St. Mary's, with its tall beacon tower, has been the church of
the Spencer family _ Princess Diana's family _ since 1508 when Sir
John Spencer bought the 15,000-acre Althorp estate.
   Laurence Washington, the great-great-great-grandfather of the
first American president, was a cousin by marriage of the Spencers
and lived on the estate until he died in December 1616 and was
buried in the chancel near the church altar. Laurence's younger
brother, Robert, also is buried in the church.
   Their tombstones bear the Washington coat of arms with three
stars over two horizontal bars. It is thought to have inspired the
design of the American flag.
   As promised last week, church officials took up a collection from
among the assembled journalists to raise money to help restore the
church. There was no word on how much was raised.
   Church officials say they need $190,000 to preserve the church,
which overlooks the thatched roofs and farmlands of Great Brington,
66 miles northwest of London.
   Several hundred people, fortified by picnic baskets and
thermoses, staked out places near the church despite a drenching
rain.
   ``It's the wedding of the year,'' said Emily Coghlan, 64, an
onlooker who deployed her lawn chair in front of the church at 7
a.m., eight hours before the ceremony.
