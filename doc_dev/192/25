   A crude incendiary device has been sent to
Princess Diana at Buckingham Palace, Scotland Yard said.
   The palace's security system spotted it Thursday within minutes
and anti-terrorist squad officers took it away for forensic
examination, a police statement said.
   ``It must be emphasized that this crude incendiary device was
not a bomb and did not originate from any terrorist organization,''
the statement said.
   Police sources said it was believed the work of ``a crank.''
   Scotland Yard said no member of the royal family was ever at
risk in the incident.
   The device was contained in a package addressed to the Princess
of Wales and delivered to Buckingham Palace Thursday morning, the
statement said.
   It is not known where the princess was when the package arrived.
She and her husband, Prince Charles, live about a mile away at
Kensington Palace when they are in London.
   Diana kept to her official schedule and visited a center for the
elderly in southwest London Thursday morning.
