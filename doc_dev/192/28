   The Duke and Duchess of York named their
two-week-old daughter Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, Buckingham Palace
announced today.
   The baby, who is fifth in line to the throne, will be known as
Her Royal Highness The Princess Beatrice of York, the palace said.
   She is the first child of the former Sarah Ferguson and her
husband, Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Britain's newest princess is currently at Balmoral Castle, the
queen's summer home in Scotland, with her parents and grandparents.
   She was born Aug. 8, 1988 at 8:18 p.m., considered one of the
luckiest moments of the century by Chinese astrologers, and flew to
Scotland hours after leaving Portland Hospital in London with her
parents on Aug. 12.
   The name Beatrice _ which means bringer of joy _ has royal
roots. The youngest of Queen Victoria's nine children was named
Princess Beatrice.
   While the duke and duchess were deciding on a name, British
gamblers had a few ideas as well. But their top favorites,
Charlotte, Victoria, Annabel and Elizabeth, all turned out to be
losers.
   The tabloid Sun, Britain's largest-circulation paper, hit the
mark last Friday with a front-page banner headline revealing all
three of the baby's names correctly.
   The paper said Annabel was Andrew and Sarah's first choice but
the name was rejected by the queen as ``too yuppie.'' It said the
queen suggested the name Beatrice during a family gathering at
Balmoral.
   ``It was agreed to be the perfect compromise _ unusual enough to
please Fergie, but royal enough to please the queen,'' The Sun said.
   Princess Beatrice's second name, Elizabeth, is after her
grandmother, the queen, and her great-grandmother, Queen Mother
Elizabeth, who just celebrated her 88th birthday.
   The baby's third name, Mary, is the middle name of the duchess'
mother, Susan Barrantes, wife of Argentinian polo player Hector
Barrantes. It is also the name of Andrew's great-grandmother, Queen
Mary, wife of King George V.
   Taking two weeks to choose a name is not unusual in the royal
family.
   The queen's daughter, Princess Anne and her husband Mark
Phillips took more than three weeks to name their son, Peter, and
almost four weeks to name their daughter, Zara.
   Prince Charles and his wife Diana were comparatively quick to
name their children. Prince William, who is second in line to the
throne behind his father, was named eight days after his birth and
his younger brother, Prince Harry, who is third in line, was named
after 24 hours.
   But Charles himself was referred to as the ``infant son'' for
about a month after he was born on Nov. 14, 1948. His name was
announced the day before his christening on Dec. 14 of that year.
