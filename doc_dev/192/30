<TEXT>     "This will be the biggest meeting of royalty in Norway, at least, since the
death of King Olav's father, King Haakon, in 1957," a Norwegian Foreign
Ministry spokesman assures us.;    Among commoners in attendance will be Dan
Quayle.; (hbox);    Speaking of Charles, a book of his watercolors, with
commentary by the artist, will be published this fall. Profits will go to
charity, according to the publishers, also known as the Little Brown people.;
(hbox);    And speaking of Di, the war left her as the only star attraction at
the charity premiere in London on Wednesday of "Postcards From the Edge." The
stars of the film, Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine and Dennis Quaid, were
banned by studio executives from making the trip across the Atlantic.; (hbox);
   Then there's this: Thomas Rountree pleaded guilty this week in a Scottish
court to frightening Princess Diana's mother, Frances Shand-Kydd, by
constantly sitting in his car parked by her house in Oban.;    He was put on a
year's probation and told to behave himself. Rountree assured the court that
his only motive was to meet the divorced Kydd, and that he had no ulterior
intent.  </TEXT>
