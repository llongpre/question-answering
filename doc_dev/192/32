   Prince Charles was in ``high
spirits'' today following surgery on his right arm, which was badly
broken when he fell off his horse during a polo match, his
spokesman said.
   But the 41-year-old prince, an avid polo player for 25 years,
will remain hospitalized so doctors can keep an eye on his arm,
spokesman Dickie Arbiter said.
   ``He is in good form and high spirits, chatting away to staff
and doctors, but there will be no departure today,'' the spokesman
said.
   ``There is nothing ominous in no departure today. It is a bad
fracture, a bad break and his arm is swollen,'' Arbiter said.
   Charles underwent a 45-minute operation under general anesthetic
Thursday to set two breaks above the elbow of his right arm. He is
being treated free by the state-run National Health Service.
   Arbiter said the heir to the British throne was in pain today
and had been sedated with painkillers.
   Princess Diana, who celebrates her 29th birthday on Sunday,
spent nearly three hours with her husband this morning.
   Buff Crisp, the secretary of polo's governing body, said a
broken arm is the most common injury suffered by polo players.
   The accident occurred during a polo match at Cirencester Park,
Gloucestershire, seven miles from Highgrove, the country home of
Charles and his wife, Princess Diana. Highgrove is 70 miles west of
London.
   ``The prince was in the process of making a shot when he lost
his balance,'' Arbiter said. ``His horse just trotted away.''
   Diana left during a performance of ``La Boheme'' at the Royal
Opera Thursday night and drove to the hospital just before midnight
to see her husband. Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was
informed in Canada where she is visiting.
   Charles was riding his pony, Echo, and playing for his team,
Windsor Park, in the semifinal of the Warwickshire Cup against
Hildon when he fell. Hildon won the match 7-6.
   Charles, who once joked he would continue playing polo ``as long
as I bounce when I fall off,'' lay motionless for some time before
being put on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to Cirencester
Memorial Hospital, a witness said.
   David Leahy, head of the local health district, said the prince
told him during a visit that he felt ``jolly lucky'' after the
accident.
   ``He told me it had to happen some time,'' Leahy said. ``He is
extremely cheerful. He is a very stoical man as he must have been
in a great deal of pain.''
