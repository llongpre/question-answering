   Six-year-old Prince William is learning to ski on
the slope where Britain's Olympic loser, Eddie ``the Eagle''
Edwards, made his first faltering leap to fame, the manager of the
ski center said Thursday.
   William has taken three lessons on the dry ski slope at the
Gloucester Ski Center near Highgrove, his family's country home west
of London, said Dave Watson.
   William is second in line to the British throne behind his
father, Prince Charles.
   Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, are accomplished skiiers,
and Diana recently disclosed her older son ``loves skiing.''
   Edwards soared to fame in the Winter Olympics by finishing last
in two ski jumping events. Fans fell in love with his thick glasses,
jutting chin and unflappable humor.

   Actor Gary Busey, recovering from head
injuries suffered in a motorcycle crash, was out of intensive-care
unit as his condition continued to improve.
   Busey, 44, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his
starring role in ``The Buddy Holly Story'' in 1978, hit his head on
a curb after being thrown from his Harley Davidson motorcycle
Sunday. He underwent 90 minutes of brain surgery after the crash.
   Busey, a Malibu resident, was moved to a regular hospital room
from the intensive-care unit Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, where he remained in serious condition, spokesman Ron Wise
said.
   ``He's really far along for somebody who had his kind of brain
surgery only three days ago,'' Wise said.
   The actor was expected to make a complete recovery, Wise said
earlier.
   Busey, who wasn't wearing a helmet during the crash, has
campaigned against efforts to pass a California law requiring all
motorcycle riders and passengers to wear helmets.
   Lt. Ellis Smith said a helmet probably would have protected Busey
from head injury, adding, ``I don't think even the helmet would have
been broken.''

   Prince Harry came to the rescue Thursday when a shy
co-star forgot her lines in their kindergarten Nativity play.
   The 4-year-old son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was
playing a shepherd and had just uttered his lines ``in a very
confident voice'' when a classmate playing another shepherd forgot
hers, said a Buckingham Palace spokesman who was in the audience.
   The prince stepped closer, whispered the forgotten lines into her
ear, and the show went on, said the spokesman, speaking anonymously
in keeping with British custom.
   Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife, Diana, were in
the audience for their son's first speaking role. Harry played a
goblin in his school play last year, but it was a silent part.

   Matilda Cuomo, wife of Gov. Mario Cuomo, is
in a court fight over her father's will.
   Mrs. Cuomo and two of her siblings are battling their mother and
two other brothers over where the will of Charles Raffa will be
probated and who should be the executor of the $13.7 million estate.
   A Nassau County Surrogate Court judge set Jan. 5 for a hearing.
He also ordered on Wednesday that the temporary executor, Sam Raffa,
one of the three sons, not dispose of any property.
   Raffa claims he was named executor in a will codicil made in 1984
shortly after his father was severely beaten during a mugging.
Charles Raffa never recovered and died Oct. 19, 1988.
   Sam Raffa also wants the will probated in Nassau County. His
mother, Mary, and brother, Frank, have sided with him.
   Matilda Cuomo, along with her sister Nancy Mazzola and brother,
Joseph, want to use an executor named in a 1977 will. They want the
will validated in Brooklyn, where they said their father lived most
of his life.
   ``This is not a split in the family,'' Mrs. Mazzola said. ``We're
just trying to make some decisions.''
   But Sam Raffa said in a court affidavit that trying to remove him
as executor was ``part of a plan to eventually attack the provisions
of my father's will.''
