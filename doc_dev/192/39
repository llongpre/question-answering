   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II begins
her annual tour Monday of Scotland, but her family outing will be
missing a few members.
   The Princess of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of York bowed out
Sunday as the Queen and Prince Philip arrived in the Scottish
capital on their way to the Palace at Holyroodhouse.
   Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, is a naval officer and joined
his new ship, the HMS Edinburgh. The Duchess, the former Sarah
Ferguson, is expecting their first child and did not make the trip.
   Princess Diana has official duties in Cornwall and will not join
Prince Charles when he travels Thursday to Scotland.
   The Queen and Prince Philip, meanwhile, were scheduled Monday to
visit the Royal Navy at its base in Rosyth, north of Edinburgh.
Along with Charles and Princess Anne, they will carry out more than
40 official engagements during the weeklong stay.
