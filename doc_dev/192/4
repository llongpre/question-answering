   Prince Charles on Monday hailed
Hungary's role in ``changing the face of Europe'' as he and
Princess Diana began the first official visit by members of
Britain's royal family to a Warsaw Pact country.
   The royal couple were met at the airport by their host, newly
elected interim President Arpad Goencz, the state MTI news agency
reported.
   During their four-day trip, the couple will meet with government
officials, business officials and artists.
   On Monday, Prince Charles visited Parliament, where he met
separately with Goencz, Premier Miklos Nemeth and Prime
Minister-designate Jozsef Antall, the leader of the center-right
Hungarian Democratic Forum.
   Last week, Hungary's new multiparty legislature met for the
first time and elected Goencz, a liberal writer jailed for six
years after the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising, as interim president.
   Antall, whose party gained the most seats in the March and April
elections _ the first freely contested since the Communists
consolidated power in 1948 _ was asked to form the next government.
He is seeking to form a center-right coalition with the like-minded
Independent Smallholders and the Christian Democrats.
   Nemeth formally submitted his Cabinet's resignation but it will
remain as a caretaker government until the new one is formed.
   Goencz presided over a gala dinner held for the royal duo Monday
night.
   At the dinner, Prince Charles said his great-great-great
grandmother, Countess Claudia Rhedey, was Hungarian.
   ``This evening I am especially proud of the Hungarian blood in
my veins,'' he said, according to MTI. He praised Hungary's role in
``changing the face of Europe'' with its early moves toward
political reforms.
   ``Making democracy work is never easy, but the effort is well
worth the bother,'' the prince said.
   Goencz said Hungary now has a ``unique opportunity ... to
irreversibly return to developed Europe,'' the news agency said.
   Upon arrival, their first stop was Heroes' Square, where they
placed a wreath at a monument in honor of Hungarian heroes.
   About 1,500 people gathered at the square. Many applauded as the
couple emerged from their car. The well-wishers included about 100
members of the British community in Budapest.
   ``I think the princess is beautiful,'' said Janos Nagy, a
21-year-old student. ``I have only seen pictures of her.''
   ``I came to see how she looks in real life,'' he said, tapping a
pair of binoculars.
   Amalia Roth, 67, with three grandchildren at her side, said she
had been to Britain before World War II as a young girl. ``I love
England and felt I must come,'' she said.
   The couple's schedule Tuesday included a speech by Prince
Charles at the University of Economics in Budapest. Princess Diana
is to view a display of British fashion at the Museum of Applied
Arts.
   The private jet taking Princess Diana to Hungary diverted to
Gatwick Airport shortly after takeoff from Heathrow Airport because
of an electrical fault, Buckingham Palace and airport officials
said.
   The four-engine jet of the Queen's Flight spent an hour and 20
minutes on the ground at Gatwick while the fault was repaired, said
Roger Hamson, terminal duty manager for Gatwick Airport. It then
left for Italy, where it picked up Charles before traveling to
Budapest.
