   The Princess of Wales, visiting the Big Apple for
the first time, will attend a gala performance of the Welsh National
Opera, promote British exports from cashmere to toys and meet with
children suffering from AIDS.
   The princess was to arrive this afternoon for her three-day
whirlwind tour of the city, during which she will meet the city's
social elite as well as its sick and homeless.
   Princess Diana's last visit to the United States was in 1985,
when she and her husband, Prince Charles, went to the White House.
   The princess is traveling alone this time and will stay in an
$1,800-a-night suite at the Plaza Athenee.
   The highlight of the visit will be the American debut Thursday
night of the Welsh National Opera at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
She is patron of the opera company.
   Following the black-tie, $1,000-a-seat benefit performance of
Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' the 850 ticket holders will have dinner with
Diana.
   Diana _ the mother of Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4 _
also plans to take over F.A.O. Schwarz, the posh Fifth Avenue toy
store, to announce an exposition next month of British-made toys,
children's apparel and other goods.
   The princess will then turn her attention to the city's less
fortunate children with a trip Thursday morning to a day-care
program and a homeless shelter.
   On Friday morning, she will go to Harlem Hospital to visit
children suffering from AIDS. She is scheduled to leave that
afternoon.
   Supporters of the Irish Republican Army have planned protests to
mark Diana's visit, including a demonstration at Thursday night's
opera.
