<LEADPARA>  IT STARTED out like a fairy tale, but at the 10-year mark, the marriage of the
Prince and Princess of Wales sounds less like a story spun by Hans Christian
Andersen than one crafted by the Brothers Grimm.;    Casting Prince Charles as
absentee father and runaround spouse and Diana as dejected wife and devoted
mother, the British press for several months has relentlessly bayed bad news:
separate bedrooms, separate vacations, separate friends, separate lives.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Truth or twaddle, there's little doubt that things have changed since that
sultry Wednesday morning of July 29, 1981, when America roused itself in the
wee hours to catch a bleary eyeful of a shy, blond stalk of a girl marrying
her Prince Charming.;    She wasn't Cinderella, but Lady Diana Spencer came
close, right down to the glass wedding coach, drawn by prancing horses and
flanked by plumed-helmeted outriders. A pedigreed capillary of an English
bloodline even bluer than the Windsors', Diana never played scullery maid to
her rather high-handed stepmother, but she reportedly cleaned houses briefly
after dropping out of finishing school. A long-stemmed, porcelain-skinned
beauty under a charmingly ragged mop of sunny hair, she stood on the balcony
of Buckingham Palace, blushed and kissed Prince Charles to the approving roar
of delighted subjects.;    This prettiest of pictures begged for the caption:
"And they lived happily ever after.";    On New Year's Day 1991, another
picture, taken on a windswept stretch of the Norfolk coast, seemed to tell
another story: Diana was photographed not kicking up her heels on her
husband's arm at some bright soiree, but dejectedly kicking at the surf,
alone, on a desolate beach seven miles from the queen's Sandringham estate,
where the family was gathered for the holidays.;    Said Jim Bennett, the
astonished free-lance photographer who snapped the shot, "In all my years of
covering the royal family, I have never seen any one of them out at such a
lonely place without at least three policemen.";    Perhaps that is because no
one in the royal family has ever been in quite the place Diana finds herself
these days.;    In many ways, it has less to do with the apparently fraying
state of a storybook marriage than with the fact that she and Charles are the
future rulers of England. As such, they are in a class by themselves, a simple
fact but one with endless complications that, under the best of circumstances,
make it a rather lonely place indeed.;    Inevitably, almost from the
beginning, there were predictions of rifts in the match between the bubbly, if
untutored, former kindergarten teacher and the sophisticated, if gloomily
intellectual, heir to the throne.;    There was the 12-year age gap. She
bopped to Phil Collins, he mused to Mozart. She thrilled to Danielle Steel, he
pondered Carl Jung. She shopped, he fished. She hated horses, he lived for
polo. By her own reported admission, she was "thick as a plank," while he will
be the most-educated king ever to rule Britain. She was high-spirited, he was
a young fogey.;    Unexpected role reversal;  In 10 years, their tastes
haven't changed much, but the Waleses themselves have. In fact, in the eyes of
the world, Diana and Charles have undergone a spectacularly unexpected role
reversal.;    Demure, sheltered and unsullied by the world, Diana at 20 was
the quintessential virgin bride, a status of increasing rarity, but, according
to her rather indiscreet father, a condition confirmed by prenuptial medical
examination. This was a very old-fashioned girl.;    Then the transformation
began, each stage slavishly chronicled and labeled by the world media. Shy Di,
she of the nail-bitten fingers and nervous giggles, quickly became Disco Di, a
leather-skirted featherbrain who danced through the palace halls with a
Walkman clamped to her empty head. Dynasty Di soon followed, with big hair,
bigger shoulder pads and a co-starring role, with sister-in-law Fergie, as the
sort of merry wives of Windsor who poked passersby with parasols at Royal
Ascot.;    But in the last year, Dutiful Di, a designation some see as more
resigned, as well as more regal, has taken over. Diana, already patron of
about 50 charities, most of them having to do with children or substance
abuse, recently added service to the National AIDS Trust to her list of good
deeds. In fact, the princess caused headlines by pointedly shaking the hand of
an AIDS patient, a move one observer called probably the "single most
important thing done by a royal in the last 200 years.";    Royal
canonization;  Making an increasingly heavy number of royal appearances,
always scheduled carefully around the school plays and other needs of her two
young princes, Diana seems headed for the sort of royal canonization reserved
for the venerably bouncy Queen Mother.;    Ironically, Diana's ascent into
regal impeccability has been matched by her husband's descent into an
increasingly crabby dottiness that most recently bordered on disgrace.;   
Absent during son's surgery;  Earlier this month, when young Prince William,
8, got his royal skull fractured by a schoolmate brandishing a golf club, both
parents rushed to the hospital. Diana remained at William's bedside for 18
straight hours.;    But even before the little prince was wheeled into
surgery, Charles had rushed off to the opera and then left London for North
Yorkshire, where he was due at an environmental conference.;    To some, this
was simply the stiff-upper-lip-and-carry-on royal tradition at work in
Charles.;    Nonetheless, this did not go down well with the British press,
which berated the absent Charles with such headlines as "What Kind of Dad Are
You?" Last week, People magazine joined in the Charles-bashing with a scathing
coverline -- "Once Again, England Asks, 'Where's Poppa?' " -- and story
tallying the heir to the throne's paternal lapses over recent months.;    No
more man of action;  Where Charles finds himself these days is in a far
different place than he was 10 years ago.;    The debonair, if sometimes dour,
bachelor prince who leapt out of helicopters, scored death-defying polo goals
and romanced leggy starlets like some combination of James Bond and Don Juan
has traded in his action-man image. Though doubtlessly sobered by his own
brush with death during a 1988 Swiss skiing accident that killed his friend
Maj. Hugh Lindsay, and a serious polo accident last year, Charles these days,
according to the British press, is more like "missing in action," detached not
only from the lives of his wife and children, but from modern life itself.;   
As heir to the throne, Charles grew up in the glare of public scrutiny, a
pressure some believed was lessened by the arrival of Diana. But what may have
begun as relief seems to have evolved into a sort of retreat.;    Often takes
trips by himself;  The current Charles, an elusive, moodily Byronic figure
with overtones of Thoreau, tends to take solitary sketching treks to the
Kalahari Desert, painting trips to Italy and monthlong fishing forays, alone,
at Balmoral, the queen's castle in Scotland.;    He frets about the
environment, holistic medicine, spiritualism, architecture, agriculture and
the state of his personal garden at the couple's country estate, Highgrove, in
Gloucestershire.;    There, where he reportedly spends most of the week
tending to flowers and organic vegetables, while Diana and the boys remain in
London, the prince is said to while away countless hours behind the
7-foot-high walls of his secret garden, happily troweling by flashlight after
sundown.;    "A-Loon Again," crowed the tabloid Sun of Charles' horticultural
passions. To be fair, through the years, the prince, stuck in a holding
pattern for the throne, has tried to find ways to make himself useful.
Unfortunately, most of them, like his gardening, have tended to backfire by
making him look rather loopy.;    Thus, it seemed the gesture of either an
understanding or cynical wife when Diana recently gave Charles a
gilt-finished, crown-shaped outdoor lamp to illuminate his garden. A London
newspaper quoted a palace source as saying that not only does this thoughtful
gift eliminate the need for Charles to keep replacing the batteries in his
flashlights, but "he can stay in the garden until midnight now if he wants."; 
  This romantic pronouncement was matched only by a reported palace statement
that the prince and the princess, contrary to media speculation, spend at
least three nights a week together.;    Man without a job;  Charles would seem
made for gloom. By nature, his long Windsor face wears a sour, pinched look,
which, in fairness, may be more the fault of genetics than temperament.;   
The prince's mood would probably sweeten if he had a job; not just any job,
but the job he has been groomed for since his birth 42 years ago. Because that
job is usually available only upon the death of its holder, Charles has a
problem.;    The subject of endless debate in British circles, the possible
abdication of the queen in favor of her son remains only that, a possibility,
and a dim one at that. There was a brief flurry of speculation this year, when
Elizabeth turned 65 -- what many considered to be a proper and dignified time
for her to step down -- but she's still on the throne, in good health and
showing no sign of leaving.;    If there ever is to be a coronation, there
certainly can never be a divorce. If there were to be, Charles could stop
pruning his roses right now, because British law forbids the accession of a
divorced person to the throne. With divorce out of the question, other, less
drastic but more practical solutions have sprung to the minds of those in the
media.;    Royal arrangements;  Royal marriages that degenerate into royal
arrangements are hardly unknown. A flutter of whispers that Diana was carrying
on with a dashing investment banker, Philip Dunne, a few years ago fell on
shocked ears. After all, she was the mother of two, and an affair with the
future queen would be tantamount to treason.;    On the other hand, Charles
would probably benefit from a royal double standard traditionally observed in
such delicate matters.;    There have been rumors in recent years that his
relationships with such old friends as dress designer Lady "Kanga" Tryon are
more than friendships.;    As recently as this month, People magazine pointed
an accusing finger at yet another "other woman," this time Charles' former
flame Camilla Parker Bowles.;    Reprimands from the queen;  Rumors are one
thing, but even the appearance of estrangement or marital woes, which has
cropped up several times in a marriage featuring weeks of physical separation,
is dicey and reportedly has earned the Waleses reprimands from the queen.;   
Fact is the Waleses spend less and less time together, even when they're in
the same place.;    The separate-bedrooms claim, put forth by an overly chatty
former security guard at Highgrove, came in the wake of Diana's own
pronouncement on future pregnancies. In short she said she was "sticking with
two" children.;    Two is probably all she can manage if Charles continues to
absent himself from family outings. In April, the princess took her two sons
on an Austrian ski vacation without Charles, who went fishing at Balmoral. The
same month, she took them to Thorpe Park, and again, Charles was absent.;   
In March, it was Diana, not known for her love of horses, who took her boys to
a riding competition in Gloucestershire. Though only a few miles away at
Highgrove, the prince stayed home.;    When the Waleses jetted off to Brazil
on an official visit in April, the British press noted, it was the first time
the couple had been seen together in public in 22 days.;    There, while the
princess cuddled with schoolchildren, the prince, according to one British
press account, "lovingly" planted a Brazilian nut tree, "patted it" and
"wished it good luck.";    The same wish might be extended to their next
decade together. It looks as if they will need it.  </TEXT>
