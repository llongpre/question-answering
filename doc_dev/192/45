   Hollywood legend Bette Davis says
disagreements with the director forced her to flee the set of her
latest film, ``Wicked Stepmother,'' for ``the good of my future
career.''
   The 80-year-old actress said director Larry Cohen was
unresponsive to her suggestions and unwilling to make changes. After
one week of filming, she flew to New York where she stayed for
several weeks, recuperating from dental surgery. But she decided not
to return.
   ``He never rehearses actors,'' she complained in Tuesday's
editions of the Los Angeles Times. ``He just rehearses the camera.
So we work for the camera. I was very uncomfortable in all the
scenes he had me play in that week.''
   ``People will be horrified at the footage on me,'' Miss Davis
said. ``I think that for the good of my future career I honestly had
no choice'' but to go public with the story.
   Cohen called Miss Davis a ``wonderful'' woman and dismissed the
criticisms, saying the cast spent hours rehearsing at his home.

   Actress Jane Seymour says she's sticking her
neck out by allowing her son and daughter to play the children of
Marie Antoinette because the movie in which she portrays the French
queen is ``extraordinary.''
   In a deal with the producers, Miss Seymour said Tuesday, she
secured roles for her daughter, Katie, 6, and son Sean, 3, as Louis
Charles and Marie Therese, who were imprisoned with their mother.
   ``I would normally keep my children away from this kind of thing.
If it was a sit-com or a weekly series, I would never let them do
it,'' the actress said.
   ``But this is something extraordinary and historic. It's a huge
definitive version of the French Revolution and provides them with a
marvelous opportunity to learn a little French and understand the
history, too,'' Miss Seymour said from her home in Bath.
   She gave no details of the deal with the producers.
   The film in French and English, tentatively called ``The French
Revolution,'' will be shot in Paris and Versailles for release in
October to mark this year's bicentennial of the French Revolution.
Marie Antoinette and her husband, King Louis XVI, were sent to the
guillotine in 1793.
   Miss Seymour starred in the ABC-TV miniseries ``War and
Remembrance'' and last year played the Duchess of Windsor and opera
diva Maria Callas.

   Princess Diana, her two
sons, mother and other family members are spending a week in the
British Virgin Islands while Prince Charles stays in England.
   Emerging from a chartered plane Tuesday in sunny, 85-degree
weather, Diana wore a sleeveless, flowered pink dress. Sons Prince
William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4, wore shorts.
   They were vacationing with Diana's mother, Frances Shand-Kydd,
and sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, and the
sisters' four children.
   ``This is private holiday treat which Mrs. Shand-Kydd has planned
for quite some time,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokesman.
   Diana's husband, Prince Charles, remained at the estate of his
mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in Sandringham, where the royal family
celebrated the holidays.

   Pianist Victor Borge, the mirthful maestro who
has entertained millions with his blend of music and comedy,
celebrated his 80th birthday on the Caribbean island of St. Croix
with his wife, Sanna, and family.
   ``We have all the children and the in-laws and the grandchildren
in the house here, 20 in all,'' he said by telephone Tuesday.
``Everything is just dandy.
   ``I have, from all over the world, received congratulatory
messages and flowers _ the house is like a hothouse. It's very
charming and exciting and touching.''
   The Great Dane, who gained worldwide fame by punctuating his
virtuoso piano playing with punchlines, was asked about the secret
to his longevity.
   ``That I'm not dead,'' he replied.
   More seriously, he said, ``I think it's in the genes. Just good
luck, perhaps. My grandmother was 102 years old, my father 85, some
of his brothers 95, 92.''
   Borge added that he still has the energy to do his quota of 75 to
80 concerts a year around the world.
   ``That has not changed whatsoever,'' he said. ``It's like a tree
that grows and grows, and every year the fruit appears. And I just
pick the fruit.''

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar will deliver the traditional Nobel Peace Prize lecture
Monday, a month after he received the coveted award on behalf of the
U.N. peacekeeping forces.
   Perez de Cuellar had no time to deliver the lecture the day after
the Dec. 10 award ceremony, as is customary, because of the
previously scheduled 40th anniversary commemorations in Paris of the
U.N. Human Rights Convention. The rescheduled speech was announced
Tuesday.
   Perez de Cuellar was due in Stockholm, Sweden, Jan. 10 to accept
the Olof Palme Prize, named for the Swedish prime minister who was
fatally shot nearly three years ago.
