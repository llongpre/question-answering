   Prince William, 7-year-old son of heir-to-the
throne Prince Charles, will go to boarding school next year,
Buckingham Palace said.
   William is to attend Ludgrove School in Berkshire county, 10
miles from the Windsor Castle country home of his grandmother,
Queen Elizabeth II, and 35 miles from his parents' London home at
Kensington Palace.
   William, who will be 8 by the time he starts at Ludgrove, has
been attending Wetherby School in London.
   The choice of the 186-student school is a break with family
tradition. Charles attended Cheam Preparatory School, as did his
father, Prince Philip.
   Buckingham Palace announced Friday that Ludgrove had been the
``joint parental choice'' of Charles and his wife, Diana.
   Another royal offspring, 15-month-old Princess Beatrice, took
her first trip abroad, Buckingham Palace announced Saturday.
   Her mother, Sarah, the Duchess of York, slipped quietly out of
the country for a private vacation in Australia with her elder
sister, Jane. The Duke of York, Prince Andrew, is taking a
refresher course in England as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot.
