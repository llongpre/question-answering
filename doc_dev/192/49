   The Duchess of York, wife of Prince Andrew, will
soon give birth to her first child following an active pregnancy
which survived two accidents, a family scandal and a flood of
rumors.
   Buckingham Palace insists the birth is due in mid-August, but
Britain already looks set for a fresh bout of royal baby hoopla,
spurred by excited predictions in the tabloid press that the big
day is imminent.
   The Sun newspaper said Friday the duchess' weight and other
health problems may force a Caesarian delivery this weekend.
   On July 22, the Star claimed the birth was likely to be
artificially induced within 48 hours because the duchess feared
losing the baby.
   Every other day, Andrew is prematurely reported to have left his
Royal Navy ship in Singapore to be at her side during the delivery.
   But Buckingham Palace is sticking to its forecast and refusing
to comment on the press reports.
   The baby, to carry the title Prince or Princess of York, will be
Queen Elizabeth II's fifth grandchild and fifth in line to succeed
her.
   ``Complications which could endanger mother and baby have led
her doctors to give up the wait for a natural delivery,'' the Sun
reported Friday.
   The newspaper said without attribution that the duchess' doctor
had decided on a Caesarian section because she is suffering from
high blood pressure and severe water retention, and because the
baby is in a breech position, meaning it would be born bottom first
rather than head first, as is normal.
   The Star added that the ``roly-poly'' duchess has gained almost
50 pounds during the pregnancy.
   The 28-year-old duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, married
Andrew, the queen's second oldest son, in July 1986. When she
didn't become pregnant in the first year, the British media
speculated that ``Fergie'' was being treated for infertility,
although her family repeatedly denied it.
   The duchess radiated good health during the early months of her
pregnancy. She skiied in Europe, performed a full calendar of royal
engagements and worked at her publishing job until February. When
the palace confirmed her pregnancy on Jan. 25, the duchess was
taking a helicopter flying lesson.
   Then came two scares and a family scandal.
   The duchess fell into an icy stream while skiing in the French
Alps in March, when she was four months pregnant. Earlier this
month she escaped injury when her car, driven by a police
bodyguard, collided with another car on a busy highway outside
London.
   Meanwhile, the tabloids discovered that her father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, was frequenting a London massage parlor. The scandal
almost got him expelled from his polo club.
   The duchess has broken with royal tradition in her choice of
doctor and hospital.
   Instead of Dr. George Pinker, royal gynecologist since 1973 and
deliverer of nine princes and princesses, she has chosen Dr.
Anthony Kenney, a prominent London obstetrician known to favor
natural childbirth.
   She has picked the private, American-owned Portland Hospital in
west London, unlike her sisters-in-law, Princess Diana and Princess
Anne, who had their babies in the private wing of a state-run
hospital.
   The modern Portland Hospital is said to be Britain's most
expensive maternity clinic.
   The Sun says Room 201 has been reserved for the duchess and
decorated with pink wallpaper and mauve floral curtains.
   Andrew was quoted as saying in May that the baby will be a girl
and will be named Annabelle. He refused a gift of a child's cricket
bat from a Yorkshire cricket team, saying: ``It won't be much use
... I'm sure we are having a girl.''
   However, the prince has a reputation as a prankster, and
Buckingham Palace said of his comments, ``It's all speculation.''
   Bookmakers William Hill say Annabelle remains the favorite name
for a girl and David for a boy.
