   Princess Diana, who returned Friday from her
two-day visit to New York, won praise from British newspapers for
making it a success, but some said the city expected a combination
of superstar and girl next door.
   ``The Big Apple Goes Bananas Over Princess,'' the Sun tabloid
crowed in a headline. The Daily Mail called her the ``Queen of New
York'' in glowing coverage.
   Some papers reported cool spots in a warm reception, and one said
Americans are over-eager and don't understand real royalty.
   ``Americans love a star with a generosity that is not quite
British,'' Charles Laurence wrote in the conservative Daily
Telegraph.
   ``They are imbued with an egalitarian streak that demands their
stars be as human as the boy or girl next door.
   ``This creates a sense of impatience that the royals insist on
the protocols of address and seniority even `off-screen' and a
refusal to accept that in such delicate matters as love and marriage
they are different from that boy and girl next door.''
   He and other British reporters said Americans had asked whether
making the trip alone meant Diana and was having marriage problems
with her husband, Prince Charles, heir to the British throne.
   That sort of speculation was front-page news in Britain for a
time last year.
   The Telegraph gave first honors for what it called royal
exploitation to a shop that displayed ``crude'' mannequins of the
royal family with boxes for heads.
   To The Times, Diana's reception was ``hot and cold'' and
interpreted critical reports as anti-British. ``While small crowds
of fans gathered to cheer and socialites gathered for eleventh-hour
tickets'' to a reception, it said, ``others were declaring their
distaste for royal fuss.''
   ``New York's welcome for the princess veered to the extremes for
which the city is famous,'' the august journal pronounced.
   Reports in most papers ooohed and aaahed over both Diana's poise
and the fans who praised her glamour or waited for a quick glimpse.
   ``Leaving Prince Charles behind on her first visit to New York,
she enchanted hardened New Yorkers and turned thousands of ordinary
Americans into avid royalists,'' the tabloid Daily Mail said. It
printed a picture of Diana with the caption ``Instant hit.''
   Columnist Pete Hammill called Diana the ``most famous welfare
mother in the world,'' they said, an apparent reference to the fact
that her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, and other members of the
royal family receive government allowances.
   Diana and Charles, the Prince of Wales, live on his income from
from land and investments and do not receive such an allowance.
