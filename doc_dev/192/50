   Although her visit to New York was brief,
Britain's Princess Diana seemed to capture the heart of the Big
Apple wherever she went.
   In three days, she saw an opera in Brooklyn, visited a fancy toy
store on Park Avenue and hugged a child with AIDS in a Harlem
hospital.
   The Princess of Wales rubbed elbows with developer Donald Trump,
publisher Malcolm Forbes and actor Michael Douglas.
   Diana also touched the heart of 13-year-old Hope Manley, a
Pennsylvania youngster suffering from cystic fibrosis, and Wanda
Morales, whom the princess visited in a lower East Side shelter for
the homeless.
   On Friday, the last day of her visit, she toured the pediatrics
ward of Harlem Hospital where Diana unexpectedly picked up a
7-year-old afflicted with AIDS after first asking him, ``Are you
heavy?''
   The 27-year-old princess has long sought to educate the public
about the disease, which doctors say cannot be transmitted through
casual contact.
   The princess also attended a briefing by the hospital's
pediatrics director, Dr. Margaret Heagarty, who said later that
Diana was genuinely concerned about the plight of the children and
occasionally interrupted to ask questions.
   At the hospital, hundreds of excited workers strained to catch a
glimpse of the princess. It had been the same throughout her visit
as usually nonplussed New Yorkers sometimes breathlessly recounted a
royal handshake or a wave.
   After her visit to the hospital, Diana attended a private
reception given by British Consul General Gordon Jewkes for about 60
patrons of the Royal Academy of Music.
   After that she left New York as she had arrived, aboard a British
Airways supersonic Concorde.
   Friday's events capped a visit that also included a visit to a
homeless shelter and day-care center and the American debut
performance by the Welsh National Opera at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music.
   Cheering crowds greeted the princess at nearly every stop. The
exception was when about 400 protestors showed up in Brooklyn to
denounce Britain's policies in Northern Ireland.
   But inside the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Diana dazzled the
audience as she entered to a drumroll and the opera patrons fell
silent.
   And later that same evening, New York's social elite again fell
silent as the princess walked down a marble staircase to the dining
area of a gala reception in her honor at the World Financial Center.
   The 800 or so guests remained silent until she approached her
seat at the head table, when they broke into spontaneous applause.
   Her husband, Prince Charles, who stayed in Britian this week,
will arrive in the United States on Feb. 16 for a four-day visit to
Washington and Palm Beach, Fla., where he'll attend charity polo
matches.
