   It wasn't quite Santa on his
sleigh dashing through the snow, but Prince Charles churned through
the desert dust on a tank Saturday bringing Christmas cheer to
British troops and U.S. Marines.
   A herd of camels wandering along a nearby oil pipeline provided
a biblical touch. But there were no Christmas trees in sight, only
clumps of scrub grass in the undulating sand.
   For members of Britain's famed Desert Rats and half a dozen U.S.
Marines, however, it was Charles himself that made the Christmas
season special, not the trappings.
   ``It was thrilling,'' said Capt. Michael Castagnero, 34, of
Pitcairn, Pa., who spent hours with his soldiers reading a People
magazine article on protocol and practicing bowing their heads in
preparation for the visit.
   ``We have a lot in common because he was married the same month
I was. You watch how his marriage is unfolding - the same as mine -
so it's been kind of interesting,'' he said.
   But Castagnero said that bowing didn't come easily for the
Marines, who are coordinating U.S. air and sea fire support for the
British regiment.
   ``It's usually chest high, head up,'' he said with a laugh.
   British Lance Cpl. Steve Layland of Liverpool, who was a bit
nervous about meeting royalty for the first time, said the prince's
visit made his Christmas. ``He's cool,'' he said.
   ``It really is a terrific boost to everybody's morale,'' said
Lt. Col. Arthur Denaro, commander of the Queen's Royal Irish
Hussars, who were part of the legendary Desert Rats in North Africa
during World War II.
   Hours after arriving in Saudi Arabia, Charles took a 10-mile
ride through the desert on a Challenger tank named Churchill in
honor of Britain's World War II prime minister, who fought with the
Irish Hussars in the late 1890s.
   The 42-year-old heir to the British throne, who only recently
recovered from a serious double break in his right arm suffered in
a polo accident, jumped off the tank with ease and saluted Denaro,
an old opponent on the polo field.
   `At least I climbed on without breaking the other arm,'' Charles
joked about his tank ride. ``I didn't drive it.''
   ``I can salute, which is a great thing,'' he added.
   The prince then shook hands and chatted with several British
tank crews and the Marines, asking about their non-alocholic
Christmas and the Anglo-American language barrier.
   Denaro, who laughingly noted that his army polo team had
defeated Charles' on several occasions, had a serious message for
the prince.
   ``We're ready to go,'' he said. ``We've got some brigades fully
up and running and a full brigade with a division coming in, and
they'll be ready, too.''
   Charles said he was impressed with the Anglo-American alliance
in the desert, where British troops are under U.S. tactical
command.
   ``It's marvelous to see them all in such good form - good sense
of humor, which is what really keeps everybody going,'' he said.
   Marine Lance Cpl. Joseph Horvath, 19, of Oak Lawn, Ill., had
only one regret - that Charles had not brought Princess Diana.
   ``It would have been nice to see the princess - really liven
things up here,'' he said. ``All you see driving down the street is
the Arab women with the veils over their faces and you can't really
see them.''
