   Britain's Prince Charles today praised
East Europeans for casting off communism but warned the region
faces an ``ecological Armageddon.''
   Speaking in the shadow of a statue of Karl Marx at a Budapest
university that until recently bore the name of the father of
communism, Charles was strident in his condemnation of Stalinism.
   ``In the name of Karl Marx, Lenin and Stalin charted a course
that divided Russia from Europe and then, after the Second World
War, forcibly removed Hungary from Western Europe, turning half of
Europe into a form of Marxist prison camp,'' he said during his
first visit to a Warsaw Pact country.
   Holding out hope that Russia ``may one day return to the west,''
Charles praised Hungary's role in the revolutions of 1989.
   ``One after another, the nations of Europe rejected an imposed
system which had repressed, impoverished and stultified them,
consistently failing to live up to its promises,'' he said.
   ``All of the re-emerging democracies of Europe owe Hungary a
debt,'' Charles said, noting that Hungary was the first Warsaw Pact
nation to break from the Iron Curtain.
   Hungary ``hammered the first hole in the Berlin Wall'' by
allowing thousands of East Germans to flee West last summer, and it
was a Hungarian pastor, Laszlo Toekes, whose persecution triggered
the revolt that brought down Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu, he said.
   Europeans can now ``reshape the moral and political future of
our continent,'' Charles said.
   But he warned the future is in danger from the grave ecological
damage wrought by developed industry in the West and centralized
planning in the East.
   ``Central Europe has itself been the victim of ideological
experiment and the worst follies of a command economy,'' said
Charles, who is known for his concern for the environment and
traditional architecture.
   ``Its very landscape bears the dreadful scars and so do its
children,'' he said. ``We are only just becoming aware of the
terrible catastrophe you have been suffering. Somehow we must find
a way to help reverse this apparent ecological Armageddon.''
   After his 30-minute speech, the keynote pronouncement of his
four-day visit to Hungary, Charles and his wife, Princess Diana,
moved to a nearby fruit and vegetable market to meet shoppers.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher toured the same market
when she visited Hungary in 1984.
   Britain's royal couple got an enthusiastic welcome from
Hungarian vendors and customers alike, chatting with those who
could speak English and admiring the rich assortment of traditional
salami and other produce.
   The princess, elegant in a pink suit with purple trim, won
universal admiration from the middle-aged Hungarian women straining
to catch a glimpse of her.
   ``She's beautiful,'' cooed Jolan Varga after the princess left
the market. Cries of ``Lady Di!'' rang out from children perched on
a staircase above the market floor.
   The royal couple, who arrived in Hungary late Monday, made
front-page news in all the national dailies today. State radio in
the early morning read extracts from Prince Charles' writings on
the ills of modern architecture.
   Later today, Charles was to meet Imre Makovecz, a Hungarian
architect well known for combining traditional motifs with his
modern designs.
   Diana attended a fashion show, and was later scheduled to visit
a movie set, where Hungarians are making a film about the
short-lived 1956 revolt crushed by Soviet troops.
