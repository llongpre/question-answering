   Moves to unify Europe should not be feared as
threats to the special character of countries like France or
Britain, Prince Charles said Thursday.
   ``Certain worries have been expressed about the uniformity that
could result from the single market,'' Britain's heir to the throne
told a luncheon sponsored by the Franco-British Chamber of Commerce.
``I don't believe the French, nor the English, have very much to
fear in that direction.''
   Charles, making a five-day official visit to France with his
wife, Princess Diana, said taking down trade barriers ``will not
wipe out geography, language, culture. I'm glad.''
   The 10 nations of the European Economic Community have agreed to
eliminate barriers to free movement of people, goods, services and
capital by the end of 1992.
   On the fourth day of their visit, Charles and Diana also visited
the Paris branch of the British department store Marks and Spencer
and the nearby French menswear store Madelios.

   Nobel Peace Prize winners Mother
Teresa and Archbishop Desmond Tutu had a reunion Thursday at a
reception for the 78-year-old nun, who is establishing a mission for
the poor in a black township.
   ``It's a good thing that she's here, anything that brings people
together and highlights some of our squalor and poverty in a country
as developed and wealthy as this,'' Tutu said.
   Since she arrived in South Africa on Tuesday, Mother Teresa has
refused to comment on apartheid, the country's system of racial
separation. She said her purpose is to provide food, clothing,
shelter and care ``to the poorest of the poor.''
   On Thursday morning, she approved a site in the black township of
Khayelitsha for the mission, which will be run by four nuns she
brought with her.
   At the reception, the founder of the Missionaries of Charity and
the Anglican cleric reminisced about their meeting several years ago
in Paris at a human rights conference.

   Medals awarded to war hero Peter Townsend,
romantically linked to Princess Margaret in the 1950s, were sold
Thursday to a Canadian collector, Sotheby's auction house said.
   Townsend, a former group captain, was the first Royal Air Force
fighter pilot to destroy a German aircraft over England in World War
II, downing a Heinkel III in his Hurricane on Feb. 3, 1940, near
Whitby, Yorkshire.
   Townsend was not present at the sale, which netted $39,380. He
lives at Le Perray-en-Yvelines in France and said he wanted money to
launch a fund to help children who have suffered in wars.
   His original flying log books were sold with the 12 medals, which
included a Royal Victorian Order, Distinguished Service Order,
Distinguished Flying Cross and decorations from Denmark and the
Netherlands.
   Townsend, who will be 74 on Nov. 22, described the 1940 air
fights of the Battle of Britain as the ``greatest spiritual and
human experience of my life.''
   He served later as an aide to King George VI and at Buckingham
Palace he met the monarch's younger daughter, Princess Margaret.
They fell in love but as Townsend was divorced, pressure was brought
on Margaret not to marry him and she publicly renounced him in
November 1955.

   Though on NBC's ``Golden Girls'' she lives with
three other women, actress Betty White says in real life, ``I could
no more dream of living with other women than sitting on the moon in
a spaceship.''
   ``I'm with people too much of the time, and my greatest luxury is
knowing I can spend the whole day alone not watching the clock,''
White told US magazine.
   The actress lives in Brentwood, Calif., alone except for her
three dogs: Dinah, Timothy and Cricket.
   White, 66, who was married to game show host Allen Ludden for 18
years before his 1982 death from cancer, said she believes a person
can find love more than once in a lifetime. But, she added, ``at
this point in my life, I don't need marriage.''
   ``The beauty of this day and age is that I can go away with a man
for the weekend or he can come to my house _ and nobody thinks
anything about it,'' she said. ``That kind of freedom is marvelous.''

   Justine and Jason Bateman both agree the ``Family
Ties'' star gives her younger brother plenty of advice _ they just
disagree on how it's presented.
   ``She always gives me advice about things I already know. In
fact, she gets pretty motherly,'' Jason, the teen-age star of ``The
Hogan Family,'' says in US magazine. ``I let it go through one ear
and out the other.''
   But 22-year-old Justine says her words of wisdom are those of a
friend, not a mom.
   ``We're very connected. So if I tell him something, it's not
because I'm his big sister, but because I'm someone who's known him
all his life,'' she said.
   Jason adds that Justine has one more motherly attribute: She
likes to keep a close watch on his dates.
   ``She's pretty judgmental about the girls I date. I think she
sort of thinks the ones I choose are beneath me,'' said Jason. ``But
I've never had a problem with the guys she dated.''
