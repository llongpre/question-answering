   Prince Charles today said he and
others in his party knew the risks of skiing off marked trails
before an avalanche killed a companion and injured another in a
``whirling maelstrom.''
   In a statement read to reporters shortly before the royal party
flew from Zurich airport to London, Prince Charles said:
   ``I would like to emphazise that all members of my party,
including myself, were skiing off the piste (trail) at our own risk
and we all accepted ... that the mountains have to be treated with
the greatest respect and not treated lightly.''
   The handwritten statement, read by a press spokesman, also
described Thursday's tragedy in the mountains near the alpine
resort of Klosters.
   The snow slide missed the prince but killed a close friend, army
Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34. Another friend, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson,
was knocked unconscious and suffered fractures of both legs.
   ``When the avalanche started, with a trememdous roaring, Bruno
Sprechter (a guide), Charles Palmer-Tomkinson, the Swiss policeman
and myself all managed by a great good fortune to ski to one side.
   ``To my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson just
failed to ski clear and were swept away in a whirling maelstrom as
the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past us to the valley
below,'' the prince said.
   ``It was all over in a terrifying matter of seconds,'' the
prince said.
   Charles, his wife, Diana, and sister-in-law, the Duchess of
York, landed at Northolt, a Royal Air Force base 11 miles west of
London, this afternoon aboard a Queen's Flight aircraft after a
1{-hour from Zurich. The plane carried Lindsay's coffin.
   Lindsay's pregnant widow, Sarah, was at Northolt when the royal
party, wearing black, arrived. The 34-year-old press officer at
Buckingham Palace watched from a VIP lounge as eight officers from
her husband's Royal Lancers regiment carried the coffin from the
aircraft.
   She is expecting her first baby in May.
   Earlier today, a doctor said Charles' quick rescue efforts
helped save the life of Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson, who was buried under
the snowslide with Lindsay.
   Elsa Rauch, a doctor who was flown to the scene, said Charles
and others dug out Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson.
   ``They were so fast that they dug her out in a few minutes and I
would say they saved her life,'' she told the BBC. ``He (Charles)
helped to dig her out with his own hands. He was very controlled.
He talked to the lady.''
   Witnesses said Charles was distraught, in tears and trembling
when a helicopter came to take him away from the scene.
   British newspapers clamored today for Charles and other royals
to abandon dangerous pursuits.
   ``Charles is the next king. ... That means he must be ...
safeguarded, if need be from himself,'' the Daily Mirror admonished
in an editorial.
   The loose snow cascaded down as Charles, 39, and five companions
were skiing at about 5,800 feet in an area that was off the main
skiing trails. Authorities earlier in the day had warned it was
prone to avalanches.
   Diana and the duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, were safe in a
chalet when the avalanche struck. Sarah is married to Charles'
younger brother, Prince Andrew, and is expecting the couple's first
child in August.
   Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson regained consciousness after
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the scene. A helicopter took her to
Davos, where she underwent surgery for multiple fractures of both
legs and was reported in satisfactory condition this morning in a
hospital intensive care unit.
   It was the royal family's worst accident since Prince William of
Gloucester, a cousin of the Queen, died when his sports plane
crashed during an air race in 1972.
   Lindsay, a former aide of the queen, was a close friend of
Charles and Diana, who attended his high-society wedding last July.
He frequently accompanied the royal couple on the annual ski
holiday.
   The Palmer-Tomkinsons also vacation with Charles and Diana
annually at Klosters.
