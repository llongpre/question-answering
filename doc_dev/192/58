   Prince Charles, recovering from bone
surgery, got a get-well card from a sly 9-year-old and a visit from
Princess Diana.
   The heir to the British throne had a second operation on
Saturday to mend his right arm, which was broken in a polo match
two months ago.
   Princess Diana visited on Sunday and thanked another patient at
the hospital, 9-year-old Penny Hutchins, who slipped past security
guards and pushed a get-well card under the prince's door.
   Penny, who is being treated for a skin ailment, and other young
patients drew a teddy bear with an arm in a sling on the card,
which read, ``Get well soon, your Highness.''
   Doctors at Queen's Medical Center in Nottingham said the surgery
was a success and that the 41-year-old prince was in excellent
condition.
   He had a sore hip after surgeons removed bone slivers for
transplant into his arm during the three-hour operation. A six-inch
titanium plate also was screwed into the damaged bone.
   The fracture did not heal after the first operation on June 28,
the day he fell off his horse.

   Greta Garbo may have been reserved around adults
but she loved babies and spent hours cooing to each new addition to
her family, says her grandniece Gray Horan.
   ``My mother said she came to visit all of us at the hospital
when we were born,'' Horan wrote in an essay about her famous
great-aunt in Sunday's New York Times Magazine. ``My son was not
even a week old when she arranged to come out to see him.''
   Horan, the executrix and sole beneficiary of Garbo's estate,
said Garbo saw herself in the little boy and would hold him for
hours.
   ``I brought him to visit her one afternoon, and she said,
`Someday, you must tell him I gave him an entire bottle,' '' Horan
wrote.
