   Britain's Princess Diana, arriving for a
whirlwind tour, charmed America's fashion elite at a glittering
reception and today chatted with formerly homeless women at a
community center.
   Hundreds of residents of a housing project lined the streets as
the princess' motorcade pulled up to the Henry Street Settlement, a
96-year-old community center that helps immigrants, homeless people
and the elderly.
   Halfway through her visit to the settlement, the princess,
wearing a black skirt and black-and-pink top, emerged from a
building and strolled by crowds, waving and talking to some lucky
residents.
   Inside, she spoke with seven women who were once homeless, but
had acquired apartments with the help of the settlement on
Manhattan's lower East Side.
   ``Her visit does matter,'' said Theather Mitchell, 33, a mother
of four. ``She's royalty and she'll bring attention to the homeless.
She'll help the people realize the problems of the homeless.''
   The princess was met at the settlement by Matilda Cuomo, wife of
Gov. Mario Cuomo, then talked for nearly an hour with the
once-homeless women.
   Residents of a housing project, the Baruch Houses, had cheered
her arrival at the settlement.
   ``It's nice that she came. They cleaned up the place,'' said
Efrain Gonzales, a maintenance man who leaned out a window to get a
glimpse. ``She should come more often. It was very dirty. It was the
pits before.''
   On Wednesday night, awed fashion designers and retailers
proclaimed Diana radiant and divine when she appeared at a party in
her honor.
   The 27-year-old princess, who had just arrived on her first
official visit to New York, sounded equally impressed by her host
city.
   ``It was marvelous, quite dramatic,'' she said when asked her
first impressions of the city.
   Tonight she was to attend the American debut of the Welsh
National Opera, which will perform Verdi's ``Falstaff'' at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. As the Princess of Wales, she is patron
of the opera company.
   Irish-American activists opposed to British involvement in
Northern Ireland planned to demonstrate outside the opera
performance. But Diana's first evening in the city was devoid of
controversy.
   The princess arrived on a British Airways supersonic Concorde
flight at Kennedy International Airport at 5:49 p.m. Wednesday for
her three-day visit. Her first public appearance was on the 50th
floor of the Equitable Tower, where she attended a gala reception
and buffet dinner hosted by Dawson International, producers of
Scottish cashmere.
   Before she arrived, guests received some last minute instructions
from British Consul George Finlayson. ``For British subjects it's
protocol for the men to nod and the women can curtsy,'' he said.
``For Americans, ever since the War of Independence, you can do what
you want.''
   Many of the guests opted to shake hands.
   The princess arrived wearing a gathered blue satin tunic over a
black wool skirt with pearls at her neck.
   ``She looks divine!'' exclaimed Jack Schultz, chief executive
officer of B. Altman's department store. ``She looks great in that
color.''
   Designer Oscar de la Renta went further. ``She has extraordinary
looks and when you have extraordinary looks you can wear anything,''
he said. ``With time, she will be one of the great well-dressed
ladies of the world.''
   For Schultz, the gathering was bittersweet. His son, Thomas
Schultz, was among a group of Syracuse University students who died
in the December crash of a Pan Am jet in Scotland.
   When it came his turn to greet Diana, Schultz pulled out a
picture of his son and showed the princess.
   She was ``very sympathetic,'' said Irwin Joffe, president of
Dawson International USA, who observed the exchange. ``She said,
`I'm very sorry. He would not have felt anything.' She dealt with it
extremely well.''
   This week's tour is the first lone official visit abroad by Diana
since October 1985, when she went to the Royal Hampshire Regiment's
base in Berlin.
   The princess visited the White House during a U.S. tour in 1985
with her husband, Prince Charles, who remained in Britain this week.
He will arrive in the United States on Feb. 16 for a four-day visit
to Washington and Palm Beach, Fla.
