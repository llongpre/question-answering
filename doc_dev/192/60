   Marlon Brando's son was freed on $2 million
bail Wednesday after 90 days in jail on charges he killed his
sister's boyfriend.
   ``It's good to be out,'' said Christian Brando, 32. ``I'm just
going to go home and try to straighten this out.''
   He was greeted outside the Los Angeles County Jail by his father
and brother Miko, as well as girlfriend Lorene Landon Coughlin.
   ``It's a very special moment, a moment I have long looked
forward to,'' said Marlon Brando. ``I'm proud to have my son out of
jail.''
   The actor put up his $5 million estate in the hills above Los
Angeles as collateral for the bail, which was reduced from $10
million.
   Christian Brando pleaded innocent to murdering Dag Drolett, 26,
at the Brando estate May 16. He had been jailed since the shooting.
   After the shooting, Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, 20, gave birth
to Drolett's son in Tahiti, where she reportedly remains.
   Outside the courthouse Wednesday, Marlon Brando said ``the best
I could hope for is accidental manslaughter'' at his son's trial.
   Christian Brando is the son of the actor and his first wife,
Anna Kashfi. The couple divorced in 1960.

   Actress Glenn Close missed a press
conference because she was losing her voice, but was back on the
set Wednesday of the television movie ``Sarah, Plain and Tall.''
   Close, who is also executive producer of the Hallmark Hall of
Fame show, bowed out of a press briefing Tuesday night because
she'd been up since 6 a.m. and was losing her voice, said Russ
Patrick, a Hallmark spokesman.
   Miss Close was back on the set at the Stuhr Museum on Wednesday,
said Lew Cole, the museum's public relations director.
   The museum's Railroad Town became Hays, Kan., circa 1910, this
week when Miss Close and actor Christopher Walken arrived to film
portions of the movie, which will air on CBS this winter.
   Miss Close has been nominated for an Academy Award five times.
Her films include ``Fatal Attraction,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' and
``The Big Chill.''
   Walken starred in ``The Deer Hunter.''

   Bert Parks has buried the hatchet with the Miss
America Pageant and will sing at the contest's 70th anniversary
show this year.
   Parks, 75, will sing ``There She Is,'' the theme song he made
famous, to a parade of former Miss Americas.
   Parks was fired in January 1980 after hosting the Miss America
Pageant for 25 years. Then-pageant director Albert Marks Jr., who
died last year, said Parks was too old at age 65 to continue.
   During the anniversary show, the new Miss America will be
serenaded by Gary Collins, who will remain the pageant co-host with
Phyllis George.
   Parks said he was ``not crazy about that'' and that the decision
to have Collins sing was made for ``contractual reasons.''
   Parks appeared at a news conference with Dorothy Benham, Miss
America 1977, and Leonard Horn, chief executive officer at the Miss
America Organization.
   They symbolically buried a hatchet in a cake that read,
``Welcome back Bert. Miss America Pageant 1990.''
   It hasn't been decided whether Parks will appear at later
pageants, Horn said.

   Princess Diana's official visit to Pakistan next
month has been postponed, Buckingham Palace said Wednesday.
   Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had invited Diana, but last
week Pakistan's President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Bhutto and
declared a state of emergency.
   The Sept. 17-20 trip would have been Diana's first solo journey
to a British Commonwealth country. It was canceled by mutual
agreement, said a palace spokesman, who added that the princess was
``naturally disappointed.''
   Diana, 29, is married to Prince Charles, the heir to the British
throne.
