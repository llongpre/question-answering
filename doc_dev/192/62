   Artist Clayton LeFevre has sulked
for a couple of years because Prince Charles refused to sign a
portrait, so he has taken his revenge with a window display
depicting the Queen of England and the Duchess of York as derelicts.
   LeFevre installed the display at his studio this week,
anticipating the arrival on Friday of the Duke and Duchess of York,
also known as Prince Andrew and the former Sarah Ferguson. The
couple is coming to participate in UK-LA, a celebration of British
art and culture.
   LeFevre started his ``100 Club'' celebrity collection in
Houston, where he lived until four months ago.
   He has completed 105 of the acrylic portraits, including Frank
Sinatra, Nancy Reagan, Eddie Murphy, Muhammad Ali and Dolly Parton.
   Working from photographs, he did two portraits of the prince. He
sent both to Charles, asking that one be signed and returned and
the other be kept as a gift.
   ``Prince Charles is the only one of the 105 who has refused,''
said LeFevre, who offered the portrats to Prince Charles and
Princess Diana when they visited Houston in 1986.
   ``They took the two paintings back to Buckingham Palace. They
told me if I wanted the (one) painting back, they would send it
unsigned, otherwise they would give it to charity.
   ``I was just happy to get my copy back,'' he said.
   Angus Mackay, public affairs officer for the British Consulate
in Los Angeles, said no insult was intended to LeFevre by the royal
family. They never sign autographs for anyone.
   ``I think it's unfortunate he interprets what is a general
ground rule as a specific slight to him apparently,'' Mackay said.

   A kindergarten teacher has inspired
legislation which would designate Mississippi mud cake as the
official state cake.
   Sen. Hainon Miller of Greenvill introduced the bill Monday at
the urging of Mary Jo Ayres of Leland, who wants to add the
chocolate dessert to the list of state-sanctioned M-words so she
can help her students pronounce the consonant.
   ``If you think about it, it never occurred to me before, but we
have `Mississippi' _ it starts with an `m.' Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm,''
Miller said.
   ``And the official state bird is the m-m-mocking bird,'' he
said, ``and the official flower is the m-m-m-magnolia.''
   And what would one eat with mud cake? The official state drink _
m-m-milk, of course.

   Ewing Oil is selling the Southern Cross Ranch,
where scenes for the television show ``Dallas'' have been shot.
   The seller is the real Ewing Oil of Dallas, not the nasty,
power-hungry outfit run by J.R. Ewing on the CBS nighttime serial.
   On the show, the Ewings' ranch is supposed to be in San Angelo
in West Texas. In real life, it's a breeding ranch in Forney, 20
miles east of Dallas.
   The 455-acre ranch features a two-story Spanish-style home atop
a hill, a swimming pool, a gazebo, a guest house, a foreman's
house, stables and stock tanks.
   Harry James, one of the principal owners of Ewing Oil, gave the
ranch to the company as equity, and it was recently appraised at
$61.5 million, the company said.
   Tim Bell, Ewing Oil's chief executive officer, said the ranch is
not generating revenue for the company. ``It has nothing to do with
the rise and fall of oil prices. We're just not in the ranching
business,'' Bell said.
   He said the ranch has not been used in the filming of ``Dallas''
for several years.
   Melvin Giller, president of Nationwide Auction Co., said he's
unsure what the ranch will bring on the auction block March 12, but
has received more than 500 calls since it was advertised.
