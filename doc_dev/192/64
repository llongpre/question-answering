   As he nears his 40th birthday, the Prince of
Wales appears to be settling into a normal Royal Family family life
_ largely apart from his family, says People magazine.
   The warmth of the early married years of Prince Charles and his
wife, Diana, which surprised some after what many saw as a rather
businesslike match, has chilled and boredom has set in, the
magazine said in this week's edition.
   Moreover, the report said, Charles _ heir to the British throne
_ no longer shows the doting interest in his sons _ Prince William,
6, and Prince Harry, 4.
   Charles spends the days at his office-apartment at Buckingham
Palace, often sleeping there, and rushes off to the polo grounds
during country weekends, People said.
   Charles and Diana have become bored with each other's company,
the report said. Diana prefers her younger, livelier friends and
Charles has been seeking the company of more serious types,
including some older, married women like Bona Frescobaldi, 47, an
Italian marchesa and Dale Tryon, 40, who is married to one of the
prince's close friends, People said.
   But none of this should cause undue alarm about possible royal
rifts, People said. The couple are simply learning to do as most
royal pairs do _ coexist peacefully _ together, yet apart.
   Charles' birthday is Nov. 14.
