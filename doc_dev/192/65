   Falling off horses, plummeting oceanward in a
tangled parachute or fleeing an avalanche on a ski slope, Prince
Charles maintains an old royal tradition of thrills and spills.
   The royal pratfall had become enshrined as a national joke until
Thursday, when Charles narrowly escaped an avalanche that killed
his close friend, Maj. Hugh Lindsay, on a Swiss ski slope.
   British hearts missed a beat realizing how close the avalanche
had come to claiming the 39-year-old heir to the throne. ``It is
only when you nearly lose someone that you become fully conscious
of how much you value them,'' commented novelist A.N. Wilson in the
Daily Mail.
   Inevitably, a cry went up for the royals to stop playing
daredevil. But at the same time Britons have come to expect it of
them, judging by the derision Charles's youngest brother Edward has
suffered in some quarters for shunning rugby and quitting the Royal
Marines prematurely.
   Zooming down the slopes with Charles at the Swiss resort of
Klosters were his wife, Princess Diana, and sister-in-law Sarah,
the Duchess of York.
   On the morning of the avalanche, Sarah, 28 and four months
pregnant, tumbled into a river while skiing. That probably was the
only reason she and Diana stayed in their chalet and were not on
the slopes when the avalanche broke loose.
   Sarah's husband Prince Andrew, Charles's other brother, was off
the Portuguese coast aboard the navy ship on which he serves as a
helicopter warfare instructor. A few hours after the avalanche, the
vessel lost a helicopter and two crewmen at sea.
   Andrew flew combat missions in the 1982 Falkland Islands war,
and few suggested he shouldn't. Risking one's life for the public
good is a tradition set in stone by King George VI, when he refused
to flee London during Hitler's blitz.
   Charles's sister, Anne, races horses and sometimes falls off
them. His father, Prince Philip, was a polo player and took a
well-photographed spill in a carriage-driving race. His mother,
Queen Elizabeth II, also is an accomplished, though more sedate,
equestrian.
   Anne's husband, Capt. Mark Phillips, has suffered a few riding
spills. He is also a repeat offender at the wheel, and recently was
fined for clocking more than 100 mph on a 70-mph highway.
   On the outer fringes of royalty, risky sports and high-speed
driving are routine. In 1972, Prince William of Gloucester, a
cousin of the queen, was killed flying in an air race.
   Charles has taken innumerable knocks on the sportsfields. He has
a small facial scar from a fall playing polo, and in Florida he
collapsed dehydrated during a match.
   On his first ski run he pitched headfirst into snow. Flying a
light plane he came within seconds of a midair collision.
   His first parachute jump in 1971 came equally close to disaster.
His foot snarled in the cords and he plunged thousands of feet
upside down before righting himself and ending up in the ocean.
   Charles's biographer, Anthony Holden, notes that the prince's
grand-uncle, Edward VIII, was forced by his father to give up
steeplechasing in the 1930s, but says it's unlikely the same will
happen to Charles.
   ``We cannot legislate about whether the Prince of Wales goes
skiing or not,'' he told a BBC interviewer.
   ``It's in his character. He feels a need to prove himself
physically.''
   In Charles, royalty-watchers see the dilemma of a vigorous man
in the prime of life, well-aware of his privileged status and
feeling forever compelled to justify it.
   Forced to stay out of politics, the endearingly jug-eared prince
is limited to speaking out on issues like modern architecture and
the plight of Britain's inner cities.
   He can only hint at his state of mind through remarks to friends
that reach the media second-hand. The picture that emerges is of a
man searching for a role, fearful of becoming a museum piece.
   His mother, at 61, shows no sign of giving up the throne, and
chances are he won't be king before he is in his fifties.
   He is exasperated at being labeled an eccentric because he is
interested in alternative medicine, communes in solitude with
nature and once let on that he talks to his plants.
   His reverence for nature permeated the elegant, passionate
statement he issued after the avalanche.
   He spoke of mountains needing to be ``treated with the greatest
respect,'' and of the avalanche as ``a whirling maelstrom as the
whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past us into the valley below.''
   The Times of London, weighing the calls for the prince to stop
taking risks, concluded Saturday that he should carry on regardless.
   ``Should we become a nation whose competitive sporting instincts
were restricted to the chess board or the ping-pong table, we would
flourish neither in peace nor war,'' it said, ``and a great many
brave spirits would be stifled.''
