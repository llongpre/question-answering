<TEXT>
   There's nothing fashionable about being
this late, but no one seemed offended.
   Prince Charles and Princess Diana finally received a wedding
gift from Glasgow, nearly nine years after they were married. The
present: naming a hospice after them.
   It's named the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, which took
several years to finance and construct, and chatting to patients.
   The royal couple _ married July 21, 1981 _ officially opened the
hospice Tuesday, and spent an hour touring the building and
chatting to patients.
