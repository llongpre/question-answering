   State television attacked the British royal
family on Monday as Iraq increased the tone of its attacks on
London for its condemnation of the hanging of a London-based
journalist.
   The television upbraided members of Queen Elizabeth II's family
for alleged immorality, broadcasting segments of programs about the
monarchy.
   ``Elizabeth does not feel any shame despite the fact that her
family members are hanging out their dirty linen before the
people,'' a TV announcer said.
   A Buckingham Palace spokesman, asked in London whether he had
any comment on the Iraqi TV attack, replied Monday night, ``No, not
at all.''
   The television claimed that Prince Charles, heir to the throne,
married Diana even though he knew there were many men in her life
before him, including his brother Prince Andrew.
   The television announcer asked how Charles could marry such ``a
playgirl,'' without giving the source of his comments on Diana or
further details.
   Diana was a friend of the royal family before her marriage and
knew Andrew, Charles and others from childhood, but London
newspapers have not carried reports that such relationships were
anything like those portrayed by Iraqi TV.
   For women, premarital love affairs are taboo in much of the Arab
world and would bring deep shame upon their families.
   The television showed scenes of the royals in their leisure time
and said they were living at the expense of millions of poor people
in Britain.
   It said Andrew married Sarah Ferguson although he knew she had
had a love affair with ``a businessman.''
   Miss Ferguson, now known as the Duchess of York, dated several
men before her marriage, including a romance with a motor-racing
millionaire. There was no effort to conceal it.
   The state television broadcast other details on the life of the
monarchy that it said showed bad behavior on the part of the royal
family.
   Farzad Bazoft, 31, an Iranian-born reporter for the British
weekly The Observer, was hanged Thursday after being convicted of
spying for Britain and Israel. He was arrested while trying to
investigate reports that an explosion at an Iraqi military complex
killed hundreds of people.
   Bazoft and his newspaper denied he was a spy. Editor Donald
Trelford said alleged confessions produced by the Iraqi authorities
were clearly extracted under duress.
   The execution outraged Britain, which recalled its ambassador,
expelled six Iraqi military trainees, canceled a trade mission and
suspended visits by government ministers.
   London stopped short of breaking relations, however.
   Thousands of Iraqis demonstrated Saturday in Baghdad to protest
the British actions. The television report on the British monarchy
was clearly intended as part of a growing campaign against Britain
and its leaders.
