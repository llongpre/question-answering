   Maj. Hugh Lindsay, who was killed Thursday in an
avalanche while skiing with Prince Charles, was a career army
officer who became a favorite aide of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Handsome, urbane, fun-loving and an expert skier, Lindsay was
out on the slopes at a resort in Klosters, Switzerland with the
39-year-old heir to the British throne when he was caught in an
avalanche.
   Buckingham Palace said Charles escaped unharmed.
   The prince helped dig out Lindsay, according to Press
Association, Britain's domestic news agency, but the major was dead
by the time he was airlifted to a nearby hospital.
   Lindsay, 34, was a close friend of Charles and Princess Diana.
   Last July, Diana and Prince Edward, the youngest brother of
Prince Charles, made a surprise appearance at Lindsay's wedding to
Sarah Brennan at the 10th-century Church of St. Nichola in Compton,
Surrey outside London.
   Mrs. Lindsay, who works in the Buckingham Palace press office,
is expecting the couple's first child in May.
   Lindsay was a major in the British army when he was appointed an
equerry, or aide, to the queen in October 1983. He spent three
years working closely with her before returning to full-time army
duty with the Prince of Wales' 9th-12th Royal Lancers in 1986.
   ``He was the perfect equerry, which means he was the perfect
courtier,'' said Anthony Carthew, court correspondent for
Independent Television. ``He was very good-looking and urbane and
witty.
   ``He was very popular with the queen ... popular indeed with the
whole royal family.''
   He also said Lindsay was a very strong skier.
   In his spare time, Lindsay played in a seven-man blues band
called ``Sweatband,'' which appeared at balls and society parties.
Baroness Isabelle Van Randwyck, a school friend of Diana, also
played in the band.
   Lindsay was vacationing at Klosters in 1986 with Charles and
Diana when Sarah Ferguson made one of her first public appearances
before the announcement of her engagement to Prince Andrew,
Charles' brother.
   The major was playfully prodded with an umbrella by Diana and
Sarah at the races at Royal Ascot last June, to the crowd's delight.
