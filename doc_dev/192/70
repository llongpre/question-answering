   More than 100 world leaders passed along
greetings of peace Monday in the 16th annual World Hello Day
organized by two Nebraska brothers.
   President Reagan and Prince Charles and Princess Diana were among
the participants this year in the unofficial ritual designed to
promote world peace with a series of simple ``hellos.''
   ``I guess when you get the heads of states of 100 countries
together on anything you have really accomplished something,''
co-founder Michael McCormack said.
   McCormack, 36, was attending Harvard University in 1973 when he
and his brother Brian, 31, started World Hello Day in response to
the growing tension in the Middle East.
   Since then, the annual event that involves greeting at least 10
people in the name of peace has attracted international attention.
   The brothers received letters of support this year from the
leaders of 101 countries, ranging from Australia to Zaire.
   Last week a letter arrived from the White House with a ``warm
hello'' from Reagan, and on Monday the brothers heard from the
secretary general of the League of Arab States.
   Others who have participated in World Hello Day include Pope John
Paul II, Mother Teresa, the late Indian Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, the late
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
Sanchez, Queen Elizabeth II and former Presidents Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter.
   McCormack said he has received thousands of letters this year
from everyday people, but it is the notes from famous leaders that
draw the most attention.
   ``The president of Beijing University (in China) told me that one
of the things World Hello Day does is mobilize people to act in a
specific way to promote peace. It gives them a taste of what it is
like to participate in that process,'' McCormack said.
   Letters have arrived from Prince Charles and Princess Diana,
Olivia de Havilland, Billy Graham, Jim Henson, Charlton Heston, Lee
Iacocca, Richard Leakey, James A. Michener, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold
Palmer, Luciano Pavarotti, Stevie Wonder and Pele.
   ``You talk about a grassroots movement that goes from the ground
up,'' McCormack said. ``What we have done is work from the other
direction _ from the crowns of the trees down to the roots. People
are interested when they say their own head of state has written a
letter and supports World Hello Day.''
   McCormack, who devotes all his time to the annual event, said he
doesn't have much interest in trying to gain official national
status for World Hello Day in the United States.
   ``I think what we would like to do is keep it a day that becomes
a special day because people want to make it a special day on their
own, not because it is an official holiday,'' he said.
