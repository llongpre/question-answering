<LEADPARA>  The London tabloids continue to push the idea of a loveless marriage between
Prince Charles and Princess Diana. The Sun quotes Andrew Jacques, who said he
was a guard at the couple's country home for four years. Jacques says Charles
has moved to the country place "lock, stock and barrel," while Diana stays in
London.;    The piece adds that Diana takes the kids to see their father on
weekends, during which family meals "very often end in a blazing row for all
to hear."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  (hbox);    The tennis world's Monte Carlo Open starts Monday, so Prince Albert
is working out with racket and ball. He had to wait two days, however, because
he is working out with Bjorn Borg, who plans to start his comeback in the
Monaco tournament.;    So many professional players had lined up to be Borg's
training partner that the prince, who signed in Tuesday, didn't get to play
until Thursday.;    No royalty of any kind held precedence in this procedure.
Next in line after Albert came Boris Becker.  </TEXT>
