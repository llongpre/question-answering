   The Princess of Wales swept into the Big Apple
Wednesday on her first official visit here, and her presence sent
New Yorkers, who rarely swoon over celebrities, into a royal dither.
   ``It was marvelous, quite dramatic,'' she said, when asked about
her first impressions of New York City at an evening reception.
   The 27-year-old princess arrived on a British Airways supersonic
Concorde at Kennedy International Airport at 5:49 p.m. for a
three-day visit that will show her both ends of the city's social
spectrum, the poor as well as the rich.
   Princess Diana stepped off the plane at 6 p.m., wearing a bright
blue coat trimmed with black fur cuffs and matching black
accessories. She greeted about 30 dignitaries waiting to meet her on
the airport tarmac.
   She was immediately driven to an evening party sponsored by
producers of Scottish cashmere.
   Among the guests at the reception and buffet on the 50th floor of
a Manhattan office tower were Oscar de la Renta and Donna Karan, who
design apparel for the company.
   ``She has extraordinary looks, and when you have extraordinary
looks you can wear anything,'' said de la Renta. ``With time, she
will be one of the great well-dressed ladies of the world.''
   ``She's special! She's royalty!,'' said Jack Schultz, chief
executive officer of the B. Altman &amp; Co. department store. ``You
know we don't have royalty in this country. The closest thing we
have here are movie stars and rock stars.''
   Also attending were Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin S. Traub and
Ira Neimark, the chairman and chief executive officer of the
Bergdorf Goodman department store.
   Diana wore a two-piece outfit designed by British designer
Catherine Walker, a gathered blue satin tunic over a black wool
skirt with black accessories and a pearl necklace and earrings.
   Before the princess arrived, British Consul George Finlayson
instructed the the guests on royal etiquette.
   ``For British subjects it's protocol for the men to nod and the
women can curtsy. For Americans, ever since the War of Independence,
you can do what you want,'' he said, eliciting laughter among the
150 to 200 people present.
   During her visit, Diana also will hobnob with socialite Brooke
Astor, developer Donald Trump, actor Michael Douglas, publisher
Malcolm Forbes and others of the rich-and-famous class.
   Lesser mortals were preparing for the visit by snapping up street
vendors' Very Important Princess T-shirts, Union Jacks and other
commemorative items.
   But all will not be black tie receptions for the 27-year-old
princess, said Stewart Grainger, a spokesman for the British
Information Service.
   Diana, who is traveling without husband Prince Charles or
children William and Harry, will visit a day-care center and shelter
for the homeless on Manhattan's Lower East Side on Thursday. Later
that day she'll talk about British-made toys, food, gifts and
children's clothing at F.A.O. Schwarz, the city's topmost toy store.
   Thursday night, she will see a production of ``Falstaff' at the
Welsh National Opera's American debut at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music, followed by a black-tie gala that 850 of the city's beautiful
people have paid $1,000 apiece to attend.
   On Friday, after visiting Harlem Hospital to meet with children
suffering from AIDS, the princess returns to London.
   Not everyone is thrilled with the royal visit.
   Peter King, Nassau County comptroller and chairman of the
Committee for Legal Justice in Northern Ireland, called the princess
a symbol of the crown ``and its tyranny.''
   He said 500 people would demonstrate outside the Brooklyn theater
during the performance to protest Britain's involvement in Northern
Ireland.
