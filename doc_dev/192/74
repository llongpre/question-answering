   The publisher of The People newspaper said Monday
he has fired its editor for publishing photographs of Princes
William and Harry that were deemed to be ``not acceptable.''
   Wendy Henry, who was appointed six months ago by publisher
Robert Maxwell to edit the Sunday tabloid newspaper, had no comment
on her dismissal.
   The front-page photos showed 7-year-old William in a pose
captioned: ``Willie's sly pee in park,'' and a series of pictures
of 5-year-old Harry in a tussle with schoolmates.
   Their parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, issued a
statement deploring them as an intrusion into the boys' privacy and
a security concern.
   The photos appeared to have been taken in a garden square at the
school they attend.
   Maxwell said another photo in The People that he found
unacceptable was a closeup of entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. appearing
ill with an uncovered wound on his throat that the caption
attributed to cancer treatment.
   On Sunday, Ms. Henry said of the photographs of William: ``It is
a charming picture taken in a public place.''
   The photos of Harry, headlined ``His Royal Cry-ness,'' carried a
caption that said ``Shyboy Harry hates his pals ragging him,'' and
were accompanied by a text saying he was ``mercilessly picked on by
schoolmates'' and burst into tears whenever playtime ``threatens to
get too rough.''
   Maxwell praised Ms. Henry's ``outstanding journalistic
abilities'' but said ``there have been several occasions on which
distressing photographs, which many people found deeply offensive,
myself included, have appeared in The People; and there have been
intrusions into privacy which are not acceptable to me.
   ``Both were exemplified by the photographs of Sammy Davis Jr.,
showing him with his appalling cancer of the throat, and of the
children of the Prince and Princess of Wales,'' he told BBC radio.
   He also cited a recent picture in The People of dead bodies from
an airliner crash.
   Charles, heir to the throne, and his wife called the pictures
``intrusive and irresponsible.'' Their statement said they have
``regularly asked editors to respect the privacy of Prince William
and Prince Harry at school as they want the two young children to
have as normal a school life as possible.''
   ``In addition, the attentions of paparazzi photographers have
obvious security implications,'' the statement said.
