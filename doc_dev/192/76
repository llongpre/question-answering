   Britain's Prince Charles arrived in South
Florida today for two weekend polo matches, a couple of benefits
with high society and some quiet time on a horse ranch.
   But at least one local official plans to give the Prince of Wales
the royal snub.
   ``The whole thing seems a little snooty to me,'' said Vero Beach
Mayor Ken Macht.
   After taking part in charity polo matches today and Sunday, the
prince flies on to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia and to
Venezuela, where he will visit a rain forest.
   Charles began his eighth U.S. visit in New York with a private
dinner party Friday night. Charles is traveling alone. His wife,
Princess Diana, made a highly publicized, four-day visit to New York
earlier this month.
   He spent a quiet, 24-hour visit to Washington that included a
get-acquainted dinner with President Bush at his mountain retreat.
   Bush, greeting Charles on his arrival by helicopter Friday night
at the Camp David, Md., presidential retreat, told reporters they
would discuss ``a wide array of issues'' over an informal dinner of
grilled swordfish and rice pilaf at Aspen Lodge.
   Charles ducked a question whether he would take the occasion to
lobby for one of his favorite causes _ protecting the environment _
as British officials had predicted he would. ``You never know,'' he
said.
   The only other invited guests to the two-hour dinner were Bush's
wife, Barbara; British ambassador Sir Antony Acland and his wife;
Henry Catto, the U.S. ambassador-designate to London; and Brent
Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser.
   It was the first time that Bush and the eldest son of Queen
Elizabeth II had held an extended conversation, although the former
vice president had met Charles during two previous royal visits in
1981 and 1985.
   It was Charles' second visit to Camp David, the presidential
retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland north of Washington.
He and his sister, Princess Anne, were there in 1970 as guests of
President Nixon's daughters Tricia and Julie, who served grilled
steaks and banana splits.
   Earlier Friday, the prince met over lunch at the British Embassy
with 16 American leaders in business, education, science and social
welfare programs, had afternoon tea with Vice President and Mrs. Dan
Quayle and greeted about 250 former and current American scholarship
students at British universities.
   Charles drew laughter and applause from his audience of Marshall
Scholars, whose studies abroad were financed by the British
government, when he asked about the 234 former scholars whose
whereabouts are unknown.
   ``Have they vanished off the face of the Earth or did they drop
out and are now rearing goats in Georgia? Or practicing sustainable
development in Idaho?'' he asked.
   ``Perhaps they were picked up by visiting UFOs, and their very
special skills are even now being exploited by alien intelligence in
some far-flung corners of the universe,'' Charles suggested.
   ``In that case, it merely confirms the advantages of the British
educational system,'' he said.
   Among the guests at the embassy lunch were Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,
D-Tenn.; Michael J. Boskin, nominated to head the president's
Council of Economic Advisers; Donald Graham, publisher of The
Washington Post; Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., deputy publisher of The
New York Times; Dr. Robert Watson, an expert on the ozone layer with
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Discovery space
shuttle astronaut Rhea Seddon; Bryant Gumbel, anchorman for NBC-TV's
``Today'' show; and several public and private officials concerned
with the environment, job training and housing.
