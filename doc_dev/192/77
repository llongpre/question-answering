   Police arrested a man with a gun outside a
train station in south Wales on Tuesday while Princess Diana was
inside launching an educational project, they said.
   South Wales police said they did not believe there was a direct
connection between the royal visit and the unidentified 41-year-old
man who was arrested behind a sidewalk security barrier outside a
pub next to Cardiff station.
   Buckingham Palace said the princess was only told of the arrest
after she left the station.
   Reporters at the station said they believed the weapon was only
a gas-powered air pistol. Police gave no details but said the gun
was not a fake and the man was likely to be charged.
   A pub employee said the unshaven man was wearing a long coat and
holding a shopping bag when police arrested him.
   ``Two officers grabbed his arms and they took what appeared to
be some kind of pellet gun from one of his pockets. I didn't see
what he did to make them suspicious,'' said the witness on
condition of anonymity.
   The 27-year-old princess, the wife of Prince Charles, came to
the station to unveil a plaque on a diesel locomotive that will
pull a ``traveling college'' train around Britain.
   The train has sleeping berths for 168 pupils and 22 staff
members who live and work on board during five-day courses in
geography, history, and culture.
   The courses fulfill a field study requirement.
   On April 13, a man was arrested in Cramlington, Northumberland,
after lunging at the princess during a royal visit. He said later
he was trying to hug her and was not charged.
