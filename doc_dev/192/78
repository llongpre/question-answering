   Princess Diana's wide-ranging royal rounds
Thursday took her from a family living in a homeless shelter to FAO
Schwarz's treasure trove of toys, topped by a night at the opera and
the visit's first protesters.
   Cheering crowds turned out at each stop to glimpse the princess,
who thrilled some Lower East Siders by shaking some hands and
accepting flowers.
   The exception was a crowd of more than 400 Irish-American
protesters across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where the
princess attended the American debut of the Welsh National Opera.
   A dinner at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center was
planned after the opera performance of ``Falstaff.''
   Charles J. Hynes, a potential mayoral candidate, said, ``The
protest is not directed against Princess Diana, it's directed
against her as a symbol of British government, which for much too
long has inhabited Northern Ireland and depressed Irish Catholics.''
   Both Mayor Edward I. Koch and developer Donald Trump were heckled
as they arrived at the academy, in a neighborhood where scattered
renovations and new businesses contrast with dilapidated low-income
housing.
   When Diana, wearing a white evening gown, arrived by limousine
with a police escort, she was cheered by a smattering of local
residents while the protesters loudly chanted ``IRA, IRA.''
   Koch spoke with her in a receiving line, telling reporters Diana
told him she hoped her motorcade wasn't tying up traffic.
   As for the protesters invoking the name of the British-outlawed
Irish Republican Army, Koch said: ``She didn't mention it. I didn't
mention it. It's part of the New York City landscape.''
   Inside, as she entered a balcony box, the orchestra sounded a
drum roll and a hush fell over the audience. The orchestra played
``God Save the Queen,'' the ``Star Spangled Banner'' and the ``Welsh
National Anthem.''
   From the stage, Koch told her: ``I want to bid you welcome. The
city is graced by your presence. We want to be sure your visit goes
just the way you want it to be so when you go home you can say you
had a royal time in New York.''
   Also at the performance was Bianca Jagger, who described Diana as
``marvelous, attractive, beautiful and seems to be doing a great job
as future queen of England.''
   At the upscale Fifth Avenue toy store FAO Schwarz, Diana attended
a luncheon to promote British-made toys and toured its floors with
store president Peter Harris.
   ``It must be fun to be in a place like this every day,'' store
spokeswoman Brooke Adkins quoted the princess as saying.
   Harris said Diana stopped frequently to admire items, saying,
``Oh, this is cute,'' and commenting that her children, Princes
Harry and William, would enjoy them. Her favorite appeared to be a
large white teddy bear.
   She shook hands with several onlookers outside the store before
leaving.
   Earlier Thursday Diana visited the Henry Street Settlement, a
community center on Manhattan's Lower East Side that has helped the
disadvantaged for nearly a century.
   There she met Linda Correa, a homeless woman who temporarily
lives in an apartment supplied by the shelter, and other women who
were once homeless.
   ``These are really terrific women,'' the princess said, according
to the settlement's director, Verona Jeter, who accompanied Diana on
her tour.
   ``She was really impressed with them,'' Ms. Jeter said.
   And 7-year-old Raamel Correa was impressed with her. ``She's
nice. Like a friend of mine,'' he said.
   At the settlement's day care center, Diana visited a group of 11
children ages 2 to 5, crouching low to admire the valentines they
were making and chatting softly with them. She tied the shoe of one
boy.
   She complimented the work of another youngster, saying, ``I love
the Cupid in the heart. Is that for Mommy?'' related teacher Janeth
Holmes.
   Day care center director Karen Leslie said of the children,
``They're crazed _ there's no ifs, ands or buts about it.''
   Hundreds of residents of the adjacent Baruch Houses project
filled the sidewalks hoping for a glimpse at the princess, who twice
during her tour came as close to the crowds as police barricades
allowed.
   ``We can hold our head up high and say, `Princess Diana came to
the Lower East Side,''' said Wanda Morales, who shook Diana's hand.
