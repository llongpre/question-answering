   Britain's Princess
Diana and her two young sons arrived on this Mediterranean island
Sunday to join Prince Charles for a brief vacation as guests of the
Spanish royal family.
   Charles, who has been staying with friends on the Spanish island
since Wednesday, picked up his family at the airport in a van
driven by Princess Elena, the eldest daughter of Spain's King Juan
Carlos and Queen Sofia.
   Also making the trip to meet the flight were Spain's Princess
Cristina and Sofia's brother, the former King Constantine of Greece.
   This is the third time in four years that Charles, Diana and
Princes William and Harry have spent part of their summer holiday
at the Spanish royal summer residence, Marivent Palace.
   In 1988, the Spanish and British press published pictures of a
bikini-clad Diana diving into the Mediterranean off the royal yacht
Fortuna.

   A new television series is bringing Burt
Reynolds back to Southern California, with the actor renting a home
in the upscale Bel-Air section for $40,000 a month.
   Reynolds and his wife, actress Loni Anderson, have spent most of
the past year in Florida, where Reynolds has long owned a ranch.
   But the actor, who sold his house in the Holmby Hills section of
Los Angeles last year, has taken a year's lease on new digs in
Bel-Air as he works on his new show, said Bobbi Ward of Asher Dann
and Associates, who represented him in negotiating the lease.
   Reynolds is the star and co-executive producer of ``Evening
Shade,'' which airs this fall. The CBS show brings a former pro
football player back to his hometown to raise a family.
   Ms. Ward said Reynolds leased the home without his wife's
knowledge, but ``when she saw it, she loved it.''
   The 15,000-square-foot furnished house has eight bedrooms and 11
bathrooms and sits on a two-acre compound with a tennis court and
swimming pool.

   Developer Donald Trump claims he's making a
killing now that people think he has no money.
   ``It's good for me to be thought of as poor right now,'' he said
in the September issue of Vanity Fair magazine. ``You wouldn't
believe some of the deals I am making. I guess I have a perverse
personality. ... I've really enjoyed the last few weeks.''
   Trump says he's not upset at being dropped from Forbes
magazine's list of the world's richest men and blames it on a
run-in he had with the magazine's late owner, Malcolm Forbes. The
magazine, which last put Trump's net worth at $1.7 billion, lowered
that estimate to $500 million in April.
   ``(I've) been expecting this attack from Forbes,'' he said.
``You know why? Malcolm Forbes got thrown out of the Plaza by me!
... You'll read about it in my new book. And I didn't throw him out
because he didn't pay his bill.''
   Trump also said he is more popular than ever despite the bad
press he's been getting about his marital woes and cash problems.
   And that popularity has rubbed off on the two women most often
linked with him: his estranged wife, Ivana, and his alleged
mistress, Marla Maples.
   ``I've made a lot of satellites ... whether it's Marla or
Ivana,'' Trump said. ``Marla can do any movie she wants to now.
Ivana can do whatever she wants.''

   Maggie Kuhn, the 85-year-old activist for
the elderly who founded the Gray Panthers, received an honorary
doctorate from Northern Illinois University.
   Kuhn was given a Doctor of Humane Letters degree in recognition
of her work in fighting against age discrimination, the university
said.
   ``When I turned 80, I made a solemn vow to myself that I would
try to do something outrageous at least once a week,'' Kuhn said at
Saturday's ceremony. ``The current and immediate past
administrations have given me endless opportunities to do so.''
   In 1970, Kuhn and five friends formed the Gray Panthers, which
has lobbied against Social Security cuts and fought for rent
control and better health care for senior citizens. The
organization has grown to more than 70,000 members.

   Former Mayor Ed Koch will talk about anything.
Except money.
   The former mayor is out on the national talk-circuit, doing
daily radio commentaries, dishing out opinions on weekly television
news-shows and even talking up a diet drink.
   But as far as his earnings, mum's the word.
   ``I never discuss money. It's gauche,'' he said in a recent
interview.
   Koch is expected to earn nearly $2 million this year, including
$1.6 million from speaking fees of $20,000 a speech, the Daily News
said Sunday. That's a far cry from the $130,000 salary he was
making when he left office last year after 12 years on the job.

   Singer William Lee Golden says he still
knows very little about why he was voted out of the Oak Ridge Boys'
country music group three years ago.
   The other three members of the group ousted him from the quartet
in March 1987, citing friction among band members. He was replaced
by Steve Sanders.
   ``We've still never had a meeting over that dismissal,'' said
Golden. He now works as a solo performer and with his two sons,
Rusty and Chris.
   The Oak Ridge Boys' biggest hit when Golden was with them was
``Elvira.'' The group's ``No Matter How High'' was No. 1 on the
country music charts in February.
