<LEADPARA>  The lull in the flow of news from the Persian Gulf has given the British the
chance to engage in a favorite pastime: sniping at the royal family.;    This
time, the charge is that the high and mighty have not behaved properly since
Britain went to war.  </LEADPARA>

POLL SHOWS PUBLIC 'DISGUSTED' BY BEHAVIOR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     How many of the royal family's subjects are losing sleep over this matter
is not clear. But in a phone-in poll over the weekend, 83 percent of those
participating pronounced themselves "disgusted.";    That in turn prompted the
tabloid newspaper Today to declare with just the slightest overstatement: "The
Queen is today facing the biggest royal crisis since the Abdication (of Edward
VIII) more than 50 years ago.";    Among the elements in the indictment are
these:;    Prince Philip and Prince Charles have gone hunting. Prince Andrew
has played golf. The Duchess of York, also known as Fergie, has enjoyed a loud
meal with some friends at a London restaurant.;    Lord Linley, the Queen's
nephew, took a vacation in the Caribbean with his girlfriend. Lord Althrop,
the Queen's godson, had an adulterous affair in France.;    Queen Elizabeth
and Princess Diana are generally considered to have impeccably performed their
wartime duties.;    But, as royals watchers have noted, it is always the
"minor royals" and the "nearly royals" who ruin things for everyone.;    What
distinguishes this flap from the kind that arises every other week in this
country is that the criticism has come from high places.;    Harold
Brooks-Baker, editor of Burke's Peerage, the bible of the British aristocracy,
has weighed in with his warning.;    So, too, have the editors of the Sunday
Times, which, like Today, is owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch.;    "On the
home front," the editors wrote, "too many of the young royals and their
entourages carry on regardless with their peacetime lifestyles, parading a
mixture of upper-class decadence and insensitivity which disgusts the public
and demeans the monarchy. The Queen should put a stop to it.";    Coming from
one of the so-called "quality papers," that attack was too much to take for
Charles Anson, the press secretary at Buckingham Palace.;    He responded by
putting out a list of war-related appearances by members of the royal family
since British forces were first deployed in the gulf in August.;    And as if
to answer the charges, the royals were out Monday doing their duty. Prince
Charles and Princess Diana visited navy families in Plymouth; Princess Anne
was at a military base in Germany; and Prince Philip was seeing soldiers in
Northern Ireland.  </TEXT>
