   Barbara Bush welcomed Princess Diana to the
White House today for coffee and a discussion of the AIDS epidemic
and a local home that cares for child victims of the disease.
   ``Good morning,'' Mrs. Bush cheerily greeted the princess as she
left her limousine in front of the White House on a sunny morning.
They posed briefly for pictures before going in for coffee with the
Bushes' daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, and daughter-in-law Margaret
Bush, the wife of the Bushes' son Marvin.
   Diana, who wore a rose-colored suit with purple trim, was
accompanied by Lady Jennifer Acland, wife of the British
ambassador, Sir Antony Acland. Mrs. Bush wore a long-sleeved blue
dress.
   The princess planned to discuss her interest in AIDS patients
with the first lady before heading to Grandma's House, a Washington
home for young AIDS victims.
   Diana attended a charity gala Thursday night to benefit the
home. Several prominent organizers boycotted the event on the
grounds the ticket prices were too high.
   The princess was aware of the controversy, said British embassy
spokesman Francis Cornish. He said he did not know her opinion of
the ticket prices. But, he said, ``You can't wander into somebody
else's country and say something's too steep.'' The minimum ticket
price was $2,500, but most people paid $3,500, which included the
honor of shaking Diana's hand.
   Despite the acrimony that arose over ticket prices, Cornish said
Diana enjoyed the charity event and ``thought everybody else who
turned up did.''
   Diana wore a fuchsia silk off-the-shoulder dress to the gala.
She entered to the strains of Handel's Water Music and presided
over a table that included two of President Bush's children, Marvin
Bush and Dorothy LeBlond.
   In addition to Grandma's House, the gala benefitted the
Washington Ballet, the London City Ballet and the British-American
Arts Association.
   The 29-year-old princess, who is married to Prince Charles, has
had longstanding interests in those areas.
   She is patron of London City Ballet and has been involved with
AIDS patients since 1987. She visited a pediatric AIDS unit at
Harlem Hospital last year during a trip to New York City and has
made similar visits to adult patients in London.
   Her second solo trip to the United States began Thursday
afternoon with tea at the British ambassador's residence and
continued late into the evening at the benefit.
   A number of women on the event's organizing committee did not
attend, among them television personality Barbara Walters and
Georgette Mosbacher, wife of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   The ostensible reason was that ticket prices, at $2,500 or
$3,500, were too high. Mrs. Mosbacher asked for her money back,
said Joanna Seymour, media manager for London City Ballet.
   Celebrities who did show up included Patricia Hearst, Democratic
fundraiser Pamela Harriman, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
and the British and French ambassadors.
   Some 260 tickets were sold, with guests who paid the higher
price entitled to shake hands with Diana at a pre-dinner champagne
reception.
   The Departmental Auditorium, its gilded pillars draped with
greenery, fruit, flowers and sheaves of wheat, was far from full.
But the British and corporate organizers of the evening declared it
a success.
   Seymour said the two ballet companies and Grandma's House would
each receive more than $100,000. The arts association was in line
for at least $20,000, she said.
   Seymour said ticket prices were discussed ``ad nauseum'' and
determined in consultation with the British and U.S. organizing
committees. The bottom line, she said, is that 260 tickets were
sold and money was raised.
   ``It's not a matter of who buys the tickets,'' Seymour said.
``This is not an evening for people to see and be seen at. This is
an evening to raise serious money for worthwhile charities.''
   The benefit featured a short auction run by John Marion,
chairman of Sotheby's New York. A diamond-and-pearl necklace set in
18-carat white gold, designed by a London jeweler especially for
the occasion, brought $22,000. A gold and enamel carriage clock
with the royal monogram, donated by Diana, sold for $7,500.
   Each guest received a vial of Christian Dior perfume and a
program decorated with gold tassels and seals, inscribed in gold
with the night's menu.
   The dinner included a seafood-filled brioche, filet of beef and
an elaborate pastry and fruit dessert on plates individually
decorated with chocolate designs before serving. Wine, champagne
and cognac were donated, along with 500 gold chairs flown in from
Britain to match the flatware.
   Overhead was expected to be low because most costs were picked
up by ADT, the chief sponsor of the gala, and other corporate
contributors.
   ADT describes itself as the leading provider of electronic
security protection and vehicle auction services, with operations
throughout North America, the United Kingdom and continental
Europe.
