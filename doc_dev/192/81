   An Iranian trying to give Princess Diana a silver
clock because he admired her climbed over two fences and through
rose bushes before being nabbed on the lawn of her Kensington
Palace home, police said Friday.
   The princess was home at the time of Ali Kashabi's entry into
the grounds of the palace shortly before midnight Thursday but was
``not disturbed'' by the incident, said a Buckingham Palace
spokeswoman.
   Kashabi said it was the second time he had been arrested in the
Kensington Palace area in as many days. He said he was arrested for
drunkenness on Wednesday night but was released.
   Kashabi told Horseferry Magistrate's Court that he decided to
give Princess Diana the silver clock after writing several letters
to her but receiving no reply.
   ``I just wanted to see Lady Diana. I think that she is a very
beautiful lady and I admire her,'' he said.
   ``They told me I was lucky that I wasn't shot. ... It was a
frightening experience.''
   Police said Kashabi, who gave his address only as California,
was caught on the palace lawn after scaling two fences and walking
through some rose bushes.
   He pleaded guilty to breaching the peace and was told to keep
out of trouble for a year or he would be fined $200. He was not,
however, fined Friday or given a jail sentence.
   The incident occurred despite the spending of millions of
dollars on security at royal palaces after a man broke into Queen
Elizabeth II's bedroom at Buckingham Palace in 1982 and sat on her
bed chatting with her for more than a half-hour.
   Since then, other security breaches have occurred, including in
February 1987 when a masked man with a hammer and a knife was
arrested after a violent struggle close to the private grounds of
Kensington Palace.
   Kensington Palace in west London is home to 14 other members of
the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth's sister Princess
Margaret.
