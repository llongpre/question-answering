   Prince Charles was recovering today
after a three-hour operation to repair a slow-healing break in his
upper right arm, a hospital spokesman said.
   There were no complications and the prince's condition was
``excellent,'' said Nigel Clifton, general manager of the Queen's
Medical Center in Nottingham.
   Surgeons installed a titanium plate to permanently hold the
broken bone in place, and the grafted small pieces of bone from the
prince's hip to stimulate healing of the fracture.
   The prince, who is first in line of succession to the throne,
broke the arm in two places when he fell during a polo match two
months ago. One fracture was healing naturally, but the other
required surgery.
   Princess Diana was at the hospital during her husband's
operation. He is expected to be up and walking within two days, but
may be hospitalized for as long as 10 days, Clifton said.
