Charges Dropped: Prosecutors in Aspen, Colo., on Wednesday dismissed drug and 
explosives charges against gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, 52, saying 
discrepancies in the testimony of chief accuser Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, and 
others would make it difficult to prove the charges in court. Thompson said a 
"celebratory orgy" would be held at a local tavern.

Recovering: Former Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) was recovering Wednesday from 
surgery that removed a cancerous prostate gland, Zale Lipshy University 
Hospital officials in Dallas said. Tower, 64, underwent the procedure Tuesday.

back to normal again real soon." Tower was rejected by the Senate as President 
George Bush's nominee as defense secretary.
