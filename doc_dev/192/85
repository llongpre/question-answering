<TEXT>
   Diana, princess of Wales, will be the guest of
Barbara Bush for coffee at the White House on Friday, Mrs. Bush's
office announced today.
   The princess is in the capital to appear tonight at a benefit
for Grandma's House, a home for children with AIDS, and two ballet
companies.
   The charity event, at $2,500 a ticket, is expected to raise more
than $500,000, for the AIDS home, the Washington Ballet and the
London City Ballet.
   Mrs. Bush will host Diana for a half-hour coffee before the
princess goes to visit the children at Grandma's House.
   Diana and her husband, Prince Charles, last visited Washington
in 1985.
