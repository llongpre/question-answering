<LEADPARA>  The tabloid gossips have gone to work again on the royals.;    Prince Charles
and Princess Diana, says the Daily Express, approach their 10th wedding
anniversary in July with "a lifestyle that is not just separate beds, but
separate holidays, separate friends, separate and rival households and almost,
but not quite, separate homes."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In Poland last month, the Express continues, they stayed on separate
floors. They don't even fight anymore, the paper complains.;    On a happier
note, Prince Edward, of whom we rarely hear -- especially in this context --
has been riding about Windsor Castle's grounds with a new lady friend. She's
Princess Martha Louise, daughter of Norway's Crown Prince Harald and Princess
Sonja.  </TEXT>
