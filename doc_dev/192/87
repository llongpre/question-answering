   The Duchess of York gave birth to a 7-pound,
1{-ounce daughter by Caesarian section and the child, the second
for Sarah Ferguson and her husband Prince Andrew, is sixth in the
line of succession.
   Well-wishers cheered and popped champagne corks outside London's
Portland Hospital following the birth Friday evening. Both the
30-year-old mother and her child were well, the hospital said.
   No name has yet been announced for the baby, but she will be
known as Her Royal Highness, Princess (baby's name) of York.
   The Duchess of York's father, ex-army major Ronald Ferguson,
said at his home at the village of Dummer 50 miles southwest of
London, he had no idea what names the parents would choose.
   The baby is the second girl for the royal couple and is the
sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.
   The new baby, daughter of the queen's second son, is sixth in
line to the British throne after her sister, Princess Beatrice of
York, who was born Aug. 8, 1988.
   Andrew was present at the delivery, a hospital statement said.
   The Caesarian section was carried out because the baby was in a
breech position, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. ``It was the
wrong way round,'' he said.
   The duchess had spent the last week at the palace in London
instead of at her country home.
   She arrived at the hospital Friday in a chauffeur-driven car,
which drove her to a side entrance to avoid crowds of press
photographers who staked out the area for the past several days.
   Andrew joined her two hours later after driving the 150 miles
from Devonport naval dockyard where he is a flight commander on the
Royal Navy frigate Campbeltown.
   As tradition dictates, a notice was posted on the railings at
Buckingham Palace giving news of the birth.
   It read: ``Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York was safely
delivered of a daughter at 7:58 p.m. today. Her Royal Highness and
her child are well.''
   Andrew's elder brother Prince Charles, 41, is first in line to
the throne, followed by Charles' sons, Prince William and Prince
Harry. Then comes Andrew, 30, then Beatrice.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, Edward, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, Peter and Zara, who
are ninth and 10th.
