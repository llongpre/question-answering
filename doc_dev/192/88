   Prince Charles escaped injury today when an
avalanche cascaded down a Swiss mountain where he had been skiing,
but other members of his party may have been ``involved'' in the
snowfall, Buckingham Palace said.
   Charles' wife, Princess Diana, and her pregnant sister-in-law,
the Duchess of York, who are with him at the Swiss ski resort of
Klosters were in a chalet and were safe, the palace spokesman said.
