<LEADPARA>  Two royalty watchers, Charles Higham and Ray Moseley, have written a book,
"Elizabeth and Philip," in which they say Prince Charles and Princess Diana no
longer sleep together.;    But Charles, they claim, often curls up with an
"ancient teddy bear, preserved from his infancy . . . (and) restored lovingly
by the Queen Mother."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The future king doesn't have to take any razzing for this from his
brothers, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. Higham and Moseley assure us those
two have teddy bears of their own.;    No reaction on this so far from the
gang at Buckingham P. Or from other royalty watchers.  </TEXT>
