   Their relationship didn't work out in the
script, but in real life they clicked. Actor Michael J. Fox and his
one-time TV girlfriend Tracy Pollan were married at a country inn
over the weekend.
   Fox, 26, and Pollan, 27, were wed Saturday, his publicist, Nanci
Ryder, said Sunday. Pollan was Fox's former girlfriend on NBC's
``Family Ties.''
   Fox's agent had announced the impending marriage on Friday but
wouldn't say where or when it would take place.
   Word leaked out that it would be at the West Mountain Inn,
sending about 40 photographers and reporters and six helicopters to
stake out the country inn.
   No details of the couple's honeymoon plans were given.
   Fox plays wise-guy Alex Keaton on ``Family Ties'' and starred in
the film ``Back to the Future,'' the top-grossing film of 1985.

   Princess Diana was in the audience, but singer
Michael Jackson went ahead anyway and sang his hit ``Dirty Diana,''
about a woman of loose morals.
   The 27-year-old princess smiled.
   Jackson had been expected to leave the song out of his concert
at Wembly Stadium because of the princess' presence Saturday night,
but an aide said the singer ``felt the fans would feel let down.''
   Diana, an avid pop music fan, and Prince Charles met backstage
with Jackson before the start of his third sell-out concert.
   ``I was so excited at meeting the royal couple,'' Jackson said.
``I am very, very happy that they have come to watch me perform. I
thought the princess was just wonderful.''
   Charles, who prefers classical music and opera, asked Jackson
how he learned to dance so well, and joked, ``Could you teach me to
dance?''
   Jackson, who will make $26.6 million from his 13-concert British
tour, donated $240,000 to a program set up by Charles to promote
employment of young people in inner cities and $166,000 to a
children's hospital.
   The singer also gave the royal couple four black jackets with
the word ``Bad'' _ the name of his top-selling album _ for
themselves and their sons, William, 6, and Harry, 3.

   Spanish tenor Placido Domingo's impassioned
singing drew such fervent cheers and wild clapping from a Chinese
audience that the star marveled, ``They sound as if they are
Latin.''
   ``It's extraordinary,'' Domingo said after singing selections
from Italian opera and Spanish popular music in his Chinese debut
at the Beijing Concert Hall. ``They are so enthusiastic.''
   After each song, Sunday's standing-room-only crowd erupted in a
roar of cheers and applause.
   Western opera was banned in China during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution on the grounds that it was bourgeois, but it has
returned to official favor in the past decade.
   Later in the week, Domingo, 47, will join with the Spanish
company Antologia de la Zarzuela in performing zarzuela, a
traditional Spanish mix of songs, dances and pageantry that
resembles opera.

   Paul McCartney says he wants to crown his 30-year
music career with a concert in the Soviet Union.
   But first the former Beatle is releasing an album only in the
Soviet Union called ``Back In The USSR,'' a collection of rock 'n'
roll classics from the '50s and '60s.
   ``I would love to play in Russia. It would be an interesting
gig,'' McCartney said Sunday. ``The first thing is to bring out the
record. Then I would like to go and see how the record is
received.''
   McCartney, 46, was frowned upon by the Soviet authorities during
the 1960s when Beatlemania swept the West. But Beatles records were
smuggled in and became popular among Soviet youngsters, who bought
them on the black market.
   ``The record is in the spirit of some of the friendship that
(Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev and (President) Reagan have got
going,'' said McCartney.
   ``It is just my gesture to the Russian people saying this peace
stuff looks like a good idea _ which is something I have believed
for years. Now we are actually seeing a little bit of it
happening.''

   Evangelist Billy Graham, back home after
trips to China and the Soviet Union, says he wrote a sermon on hope
after witnessing changes in those two countries.
   ``I think these two experiences we've had have given people some
hope,'' said Graham. ``People can't live without hope. I think of
all the people in the world who are starving, who live in war
zones, who are in prison, without any hope at all hardly _ and I
pray for them daily.
   Graham's three-week visit to China in April was his first to
that country, where his wife, Ruth, was born to missionary parents
and lived the first 17 years of her life.
   In June, the 69-year-old evangelist visited the Soviet Union for
the fourth time, helping to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity in that land.

   Former astronaut Edwin E. ``Buzz''
Aldrin Jr. took a trip down memory lane when he visited the launch
pad from which he and two others began the first moon-landing
flight 19 years ago.
   ``It brought back a lot of memories,'' Aldrin said of his stop
at Launch Pad 39A on Saturday.
   Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins started their
historic trip aboard a giant Saturn 5 rocket on July 16, 1969. Four
days later, Armstrong and Aldrin landed their lunar module Eagle on
the moon.
   Pad 39A and sister pad 39B have since been converted for space
shuttle launches.
   Aldrin now heads a research and engineering consulting firm in
Los Angeles.

   The lurid marital battles of the celebrated
lawyer Melvin Belli and his wife, Lia, have been put to music.
   Sung to the tune of the late Beatle John Lennon's ``Ballad of
John and Yoko,'' the parody goes: ``Geez, ya know this is sleazy. I
know divorce can be hell. But if we leave it to Lia, she's gonna
crucify Mel.''
   The ``Ballad of Mel and Lia'' is sung by Don Bleu, a morning
disc jockey at radio station KYUU. The lyrics were written by the
station's sportscaster, Whitey Gleason.
   Mrs. Belli, 39, has accused her 80-year-old husband of
physically abusing her and falsely accusing her of having
extramarital affairs. He has denied the allegations. The couple
married in 1972.
