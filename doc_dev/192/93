   Three-year-old Prince Harry, third in line to the
British throne, returned home Tuesday after surgery for a minor
hernia, Buckingham Palace said.
   The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana underwent
the operation Monday at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for
Sick Children, the hospital said.
   It said his condition was diagnosed recently and the operationd his
5-year-old brother, Prince
William.
   Diana canceled an exhibition opening Tuesday night but was
expected to continue her engagements Wednesday, the palace said.
   A hernia is the protrusion of all or part of an organ through a
tear in the wall of the surrounding structure. Hernias often
involve the protrusion of part of the intestine through the
abdominal muscles.
   Paul Jarrett, a surgeon at Kingston Hospital in London's
outskirts, said about one in 250 babies are born with a hernia.
   ``It is a simple operation done through a scar about 1 inch long
in the groin,'' he said. ``Children will be running about again
within a couple of days and after four or five days will be
fighting fit.''
