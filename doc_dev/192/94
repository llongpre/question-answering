   Thousands of devoted admirers of Queen Mother
Elizabeth vied to show their devotion to the former monarch on her
89th birthday Friday with flowers, cakes and poetry at her
residence, Clarence House.
   Barry Millard, 7, wearing an Irish Guard uniform, gave the Queen
Mother flowers encased in glass, saluted and executed a crisp
about-face before the grown-up Irish Guards made their annual march
past the residence.
   The Queen Mother, widow of King George VI and one of the most
popular royals, looked cool in a blue, lilac and yellow floral
print dress and a lilac hat. The Irish Guards played several
refrains of ``Happy Birthday'' and the crowd, estimated at 3,000,
joined in.
   She spent about 25 minutes accepting flowers from children and
appeared to have a smile and a word for each one. Servants
circulated afterward to collects armloads of bouquets.
   The party inside the residence was joined by Queen Elizabeth II,
Prince Charles and Princess Diana, the Duke and Duchess of York,
Prince Edward and Princess Margaret's two children, Viscount Linley
and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones.
   Many in the crowd outside were veteran well-wishers and staked
out places early.
   Julia Fox, 24, from Horsham, was the first on the scene, at 4
a.m.
   ``I've been coming here for six or seven years now. I just enjoy
it because it is a chance to see the Queen Mother with other
members of the family,'' she said.
   Emily Coughlan, 64, from Wakefield, said she had been coming
every year for about 15 years. She brought a basket of flowers
including, she said, heather from Balmoral, the royal estate in
Scotland. She also had a big yellow sign saying ``Happy Birthday,
Ma'am.''
   Colin Edwards, a local government officer from Macclesfield,
Cheshire, brought a basket of fruit, three photographs he had taken
of the Queen Mother and a poem.
   Joyce Brereton came from Manchester with a home-baked version of
the Queen Mother's favorite cake recipe.
   The Queen Mother left for Scotland on Friday for the royal
family's annual holiday.
   On Thursday, the National Gallery unveiled an unconventional
portrait of her without her customary hat, wearing a simple dress
and staring almost grimly out of the canvas.
   Alison Watt, the 23-year-old Glasgow artist who painted it, says
she didn't want the portrait to look particularly royal.
   ``She always appears fluffy, light, wearing flowing clothes and
I wanted to make her more solid. She has a lot of character,'' Ms.
Watt said Thursday. ``I didn't want her to come across as a wee
waif.''
   The Queen Mother, Ms. Watt said, was happy with the portrait,
but that could not be confirmed.
   ``I do not know what the Queen Mother thinks of it,'' said a
spokesman at Clarence House on Thursday. ``Presumably she has seen
it because she sat for it, but we do not issue statements on silly
little things like this.''
