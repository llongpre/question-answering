   The Duke and Duchess of York have named their
week-old daughter Princess Eugenie Victoria Helena, Buckingham
Palace said today.
   The baby's name was announced shortly after the royal couple
stepped from Portland Hospital with the new princess, wrapped in a
white blanket.
   The baby slept quietly through the cheers of the crowd and the
click of hundreds of cameras.
   Princess Eugenie is the sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II
and sixth in the line of succession. She is the second daughter
born to the duchess and her husband, Prince Andrew.
   The 30-year-old Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, gave
birth to Princess Eugenie by Caesarian section on March 23.
   The baby's name surprised Britain. Bookmakers William Hill said
they had thousands of bets but not one for Eugenie.
   It was the name of Queen Victoria's granddaughter, the daughter
of Princess Beatrice who was Victoria's fifth daughter and youngest
child. The baby's second name _ Victoria _ comes from Queen
Victoria herself, and the third name, Helena, comes from the third
daughter of Queen Victoria.
   Eugenie is the French derivative of the ancient Greek word
``Eugenia'' meaning ``nobility'' and ``excellence,'' and was made
fashionable in 19th- century France by the Empress Eugenie, wife of
Emperor Napoleon III, said David Williamson, co-editor of Debrett's
Peerage, a leading reference book on the aristocracy.
   In its classical form of Eugenia, it was first recorded as a
name in England in the 12th century, he said.
   Prince Andrew's elder brother Prince Charles, 41, is first in
line to the throne, followed by Charles' sons, Prince William and
Prince Harry. Then comes Andrew, 30, then Beatrice.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, Edward, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, Peter and Zara, who
are ninth and 10th.
