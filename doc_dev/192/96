   Princess Diana's mother, Frances Shand-Kydd, said
Sunday she has separated from her second husband, wallpaper heir
Peter Shand-Kydd.
   ``I would like it to be known that my husband and I have
separated, which is a great sadness to us both. No one else is
involved,'' Mrs. Shand-Kydd, 52, said in a statement issued by her
lawyers.
   Buckingham Palace had no comment, and Mrs. Shand-Kydd said,
``Neither Peter nor I will be making any further statement.''
   The announcement followed a report in the Sunday tabloid News of
the World that the marriage was on the rocks and Shand-Kydd, 63,
wanted to return to his first wife, Janet.
   Diana, wife of British heir apparent Prince Charles, was 6 years
old when her mother left her father, the eighth Earl Spencer, in
1967. Spencer was granted a divorce two years later because of his
wife's adultery with Shand Kydd, and she was named the ``other
woman'' in the uncontested divorce of Peter and Janet Shand-Kydd.
   She married Shand-Kydd soon after both divorces were final.

   Television talk show host Oprah Winfrey
came home for the renaming of the winding gravel road that runs in
front of the house where she was born.
   The three-mile lane that is wide enough for two cars is now
officially known as the Oprah Winfrey Road.
   ``This is a real homecoming,'' Winfrey said to the 300 people
gathered Saturday for the ribbon-cutting ceremony in the rural
community of Buffalo, three miles outside Kosciusko in central
Mississippi. ``It is a deeply humbling experience to come back to
the place where it all started. No one ever goes very far in life
without remembering where they came from.''
   ``Hopefully, we can get it blacktopped,'' Don Hayes, chairman of
the ``Welcome Home Oprah'' day festivities, said of the road. ``Most
of her family lived in that community.''
   Winfrey, 34, spoke at the old, white, wood-frame Buffalo United
Methodist Church, where she said she made her first public
appearance at an Easter recital when she was 3 years old. A new
brick church stands across the road.
   Winfrey spent the early part of her childhood living with her
grandmother in the poor community before moving to Milwaukee with
her mother at age 6.
   ``We love you, we love what you are doing,'' said Northern
District Highway Commissioner Zack Stewart, who cut the ribbon with
Winfrey. ``We love what you stand for.''

   Like the yuppies they play on
``thirtysomething,'' Ken Olin and Patricia Wettig worry about
juggling careers, ambition, marriage and a home life.
   Olin, who plays the brooding, analytical Philadelphia adman
Michael Steadman, and Wettig, his real-life wife who plays the wife
of Steadman's partner Elliott, both admit in the June 11 issue of TV
Guide that active acting careers cause other aspects of their lives
to suffer at times.
   ``You've got kids and a marriage and work, all at the same
time,'' said Wettig. ``From my perspective all three things are
extremely important and I'm not willing to give up any of them, but
I find at different times one is always suffering.''
   ``Sometimes I feel like I'm in competition with her work,'' Olin
said. ``It's like being in competition with the children. I'm
competitive for her attention.''
   He also admits he fears being eclipsed by his wife. ``My fear is
that Patti will have all these opportunities and she will meet men
and work more interesting than I am ... and she will leave me.''
   But Wettig said she expects almost the opposite. ``I assume that
Ken, being a guy, being his age, and where he's sitting now, I kind
of assume that he will probably make more money than me and be more
famous.''
   Sound familiar? It should. Producer Marshall Herskovitz uses the
couple as a sounding board for scripts and plots on the nature of a
yuppie marriage.

   Rock singer Ted Nugent escaped injury when
he crashed on the cool-down lap after winning the Dodge
International Star Challenge celebrity auto race.
   Nugent rolled his Dodge Shelby Z after the race was over at
Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, but walked away from the accident
Saturday.
   ``I didn't have a brake to be found,'' Nugent said. ``I dragged
my foot, I started back peddling _ it didn't work!''
   Nugent beat RATT drummer Bobby Blotzer by 19.612 seconds in the
12-lap race around the 2.4-mile road course. He averaged 76.376 mph.
   The race was the second in a series of four races to highlight a
national public awareness campaign called ``TH!NK, Don't Drive and
Drink.''
   ``If people who drink and do drugs could ever get as high as I
did just driving that car, they'd realize what chumps they are,''
Nugent said.
   Fee Waybill, former lead singer of the Tubes, finished third, and
Alto Reed, Bob Seger's saxaphonist in the Silver Bullet Band, was
fourth.
