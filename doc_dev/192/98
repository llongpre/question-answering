   Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be
restless, says Willie Nelson, who blames his wanderlust nature for
ruining three marriages.
   The country music singer says in his autobiography, ``Willie,''
due out next month from Simon and Schuster, that he prefers the
road to matrimony.
   Nelson met his third wife, Connie, in 1969. They married, had
two children and lived in Westlake Hills on the shores of Lake
Austin, Texas.
   But they spent much of their time arguing.
   ``For me the choice came down to staying ... with Connie all the
time when I came off the road _ which meant giving up all my pals
who I hung around with on the golf course or in my recording studio
_ or never going back to the ... house again,'' Nelson said in his
book.
   He chose to leave and the couple divorced.
   Nelson, whose hits include ``Mama, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up
to Be Cowboys,'' and ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,'' admits life
as Mrs. Willie Nelson would be difficult.
   ``It's not easy to be married to somebody like me and be a wife
and stay home and take care of the family when I'm out here acting
like a big star,'' Nelson said. ``I mean, it rubs.''

   Pop balladeer Barry Manilow says he
doesn't hunger for applause like many of his fellow entertainers.
   ``But don't get me wrong. This is a great job that I've got. I
enjoy it and I know there's a part of me that needs that
love-me-love-me-love-me stuff,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Manilow concedes that his own time in the spotlight has been
sporadic, by choice.
   ``I've done it this way throughout my career,'' the Tony, Emmy
and Grammy winner said.
   Manilow, known for the hits ``Mandy'' and ``I Made It Through
the Rain,'' is getting favorable reviews with the ``Big Fun'' tour,
a lavishly produced stage show playing around the world until New
Year's Eve 1990.

   Time has run out on a congressional bid to
grant tennis star Ivan Lendl immediate citizenship so he could play
on the U.S. Olympic team, lawmakers said.
   Lendl has lived in Greenwich, Conn., since 1981 and wanted to
represent his adopted homeland in Seoul this month.
   Enlisting the help of Connecticut lawmakers, Lendl won House
Judiciary Committee approval in April of a special immigration bill.
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., blocked the measure on
the House floor, saying he would drop his opposition only if the
Czech government provided a waiver for Lendl to be a member of the
U.S. team.
   Olympic rules required a waiver because Lendl had represented
Czechoslovakia in international competition at the Davis Cup.
   The Czechoslovak Association of Physical Culture rejected the
waiver.
   ``We pressed the issue,'' Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., said
last week. ``Maybe we could have (succeeded) with more time, but
... time has basically run out.''
   Lendl, 28, received his permanent residence status last year. He
will be eligible for citizenship through traditional procedures in
1992. His attorney and spokeswoman did not return telephone calls
for comment.

   Talk show host Regis Philbin took seven years
to make a coast-to-coast round trip from here to New York and back
to introduce a new, nationally syndicated show.
   Philbin left Los Angeles and his KABC-TV ``A.M. Los Angeles''
morning magazine show in 1981 for a similar job in New York City,
only to return for the Labor Day debut of a new celebrity talk show
with Kathie Lee Gifford.
   The format hasn't changed much from the early days in Los
Angeles, with the obligatory how-to segments, cooking
demonstrations and cozy celebrity chats.
   This week ``Live With Regis &amp; Kathie'' will feature an interview
with Manhattan real estate tycoon Donald Trump aboard his luxury
yacht and a talk with ageless funnyman Bob Hope at his Burbank
mansion.

   The Prince and Princess of Wales canceled an
appearance at the premiere of a film about a daring British train
robber because its star, singer Phil Collins, advised them not to
go.
   Collins, who plays train robber Ronald ``Buster'' Edwards in the
film ``Buster,'' said Monday he wrote Prince Charles and Princess
Diana that they should shun the Sept. 15 premiere.
   ```Buster' does not in any way glorify crime'' as critics have
claimed, Collins said.
   But, he said, in light of the controversy, he wrote the royal
couple ``suggesting that it would probably be best if they did not
attend.''
   A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the prince and princess were
``aware of the contents of the letter that Phil Collins has written
them and in the light of this they have decided not to go.''
   The Great Train Robbery of Aug. 8, 1963, was one of Britain's
most daring heists. More than 120 mailbags containing $7 million in
used banknotes were taken off a mail train from Glasgow to London
of which less than $980,000 were recovered.
   Thirteen people, including Edwards, stood trial in 1964 for the
crime. No one was killed during the robbery, but one man was
seriously injured.
