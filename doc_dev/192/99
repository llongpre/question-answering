   Britain on Tuesday celebrated the birth of a
princess with two 41-gun salutes, a new cocktail and heavy betting
on her name.
   Prince Andrew, saying it was ``wonderful'' to be a father,
showered the women in his life with roses and carnations _
reportedly choosing red for his red-haired wife, Sarah, and pink
for his day-old daughter, the couple's first child and the fifth
grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.
   The daughter of the Duchess of York is a beautiful baby with
elegant hands and ``a petite little face ... just fit for a
princess,'' said the duchess' sister, Jane Makim, who lives in
Australia and received a phone call from her mother, Susan
Barrantes, after the birth.
   Andrew, fielding questions from reporters outside Portland
Hospital on Tuesday, said she probably looked like ``both of us.''
Asked whether she was pretty, he replied: ``Yes, but I am biased.''
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, the obstetrician who supervised the Monday
night delivery, said: ``I'm delighted it all went so well. All I
can say is that it was a normal birth. Both of them are doing very
well.''
   Andrew said: ``It was a long time, but she came through it very,
very well.''
   Told that he looked worried while waiting for the birth, which
he attended, the prince retorted: ``That's because I was on my way
to the dentist.''
   Buckingham Palace said the 28-year-old duchess is expected to
remain in the hospital for a few days.
   Andrew insisted that no name has been chosen for the new
princess, who is fifth in line to the throne behind the queen's
eldest son, Prince Charles, his children, Prince William and Prince
Harry, and Andrew himself.
   ``We have a few ideas but we haven't chosen a name yet,'' said
Andrew, also 28.
   British gamblers had a few ideas as well.
   ``We've been extremely busy today,'' said Wally Pyrah of Coral
Bookmakers. ``There's been plenty of interest in the baby's name.
The one name that everyone seems to want to bet in the last few
hours is Charlotte, which has seen the odds tumble from 14-1 to 6-4
favorite. I hope that doesn't mean that everyone knows before us.
   ``The second favorite is Victoria at 5-2 followed by two very
popular names, Annabel and Elizabeth, at 4-1,'' he said. Andrew had
mentioned a preference for Annabel in May.
   Cards and bouquets poured into the hospital and hundreds of
people stopped at Buckingham Palace to read the official
announcement on the gate.
   Two army units fired simultaneous 41-gun salutes in Hyde Park
and at Tower Green near the Tower of London to celebrate the
princess' arrival.
   In the town of Dummer, Hampshire, where the former Sarah
Ferguson grew up, villagers at The Queen Inn pub toasted mother and
baby with a special cocktail called the ``New York'' _ made from
Babycham, Grenadine and navy rum.
   A nursery has been prepared at the couple's temporary home at
Castlewood House, a 12-bedroom mansion near Egham, southwest of
London, that King Hussein of Jordan loaned them while their own
home is being built at nearby Sunninghill Park.
   The duchess' full-time nurse, Alison Wardley, 21, will be the
youngest nanny in the royal family.
   ``I am just waiting to hear now when I will start,'' she told
reporters at her home in the city of Manchester. ``I was very
excited and very thrilled when I heard the news. It has been a long
wait.''
   The Princess of York was born on the eighth day of the eighth
month of 1988 at 8:18 p.m. She weighed in at six pounds, 12 ounces.
   The day is considered the luckiest of the century by the
Chinese, whose word for eight is similar to that for prosperity.
The London press decided it was an auspicious day as well for the
first princess in the royal family since the queen's only daughter,
Princess Anne, was born in 1950.
   The Times' front-page headline said: ``At 8:18 on 8.8.88 _ A
Safe and Lucky Royal Birth.'' The tabloid Sun, said: ``Fergie's
first baby has been blessed with the century's luckiest birthday.''
   The Sun said she would be the first royal bride of the 21st
century and listed six contenders ``for the tiny tot's hand,''
including Harry Soames, the 3-year-old great-grandson of Sir
Winston Churchill, and James Jagger, the 3-year-old son of rock
star Mick Jagger.
