   A Transportation Department official ruled against the landingfee system by which Massachusetts Port Authority hoped to ease air traffic congestion at Boston's Logan International Airport. 

   Burton Kolko, an administrative law judge, found that the landing fees unjustly discriminate against smaller planes and interfere with interstate commerce. 
Mr. Kolko, in an 88-page decision, urged the department to declare the fees illegal. 
If it does, the port authority would have to change the fees or face the loss of $11.2 million a year in federal funds. 

   The department must rule on the issue by Dec. 17. 

   The Logan case is being watched closely by aviation groups because it could have implications far beyond Boston. 
The central issues include whether a local airport has the authority to take steps to ease airport congestion or whether only the federal government can act. 
The case also could affect airports' right to make rules governing other problems, such as noise. 

   The new landing-fees schedule, which went into effect July 1, sharply boosts fees for smaller planes while lowering them for commercial airliners. 
The port authority's goal is to ease congestion at the busy airport by encouraging commuter and private planes to use other airports or bigger planes. 

   The Transportation Department's decision may not be the last word on the case, however. 
A federal appeals court in Boston also is expected to rule early next year on a lawsuit against the fees by aviation groups. 

   The landing-fee schedule has become a cause celebre among small-plane operators, and yesterday they hailed Mr. Kolko's decision. 
"We're greatly encouraged," said John Fredericksen, executive vice president of the Regional Airline Association, which represents commuter airlines. 

   But a top port authority official said the decision was only "one step in the process." 
In addition, Thomas Champion, assistant to David Davis, the port authority's executive director, insisted that the new landing-fee structure is working; about 86% of Logan's flights were roughly on-time in September, up from 70% in September 1987, he said. 
At the same time, he added, some commuter airlines are using bigger planes, allowing them to carry more passengers with fewer flights. 

   "That tells us we are moving in the right direction," Mr. Champion said.
