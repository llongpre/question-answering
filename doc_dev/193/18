   The Federal Aviation Administration and the
Coast Guard would both receive large increases in their budgets
under the fiscal 1989 transportation appropriations bill approved
by a House committee.
   The bill also would continue federal support for Amtrak, the
passenger rail line, against the Reagan administration's wishes.
   The bill was sent to the full House on Thursday by a voice vote
of the Appropriations Committee. It would provide $10.9 billion for
the government's transportation programs in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The legislation also would give the government authority to
spend an additional $16.9 billion from special accounts set aside
for various aviation, highway and mass transit programs.
   It gives the Coast Guard a budget of nearly $3.1 billion, and
directs that at least $492 million of that amount be used for drug
interdiction programs. FAA spending would grow to nearly $6.7
billion, with enough money to increase the number of air traffic
controllers from 16,020 to 16,800 by Sept. 30, 1989.
   Both amounts are increases of about 16 percent over spending
levels this year.
   The appropriations bill would provide $3.3 billion for mass
transit, $1.8 billion more than proposed by the Reagan
administration, and $594 million for Amtrak. The administration had
sought to end all federal assistance to the passenger railroad,
which expects to carry 34 million passengers next year.
   Another provision of the bill would threaten the coffers of
Boston's Logan International Airport if it pursues plans to reduce
congestion by raising landing fees for small planes.
   Logan officials plan to increase charges for small aircraft on
July 1 in an effort to reduce the number of private planes landing
there and thus ease delays for commercial airliners.
   Groups representing private aircraft owners have filed federal
suits aimed at blocking the plan, claiming the fees discriminate
against small plane owners.
   In addition, the Transportation Department has opened an
investigation of the program and asked Logan officials to delay
implementing the new fees until the inquiry is complete, probably
in November. Airport officials have refused.
   An amendment to the appropriations bill, introduced by Rep.
Silvio Conte, R-Mass., and adopted by a 19-15 vote, would withhold
federal assistance to Logan unless the courts and the
Transportation Department decide that the new fee structure is
legal.
   Logan spokesman Tom Champion said the measure would affect $11.2
million in federal money, to be used mostly for noise reduction and
runway improvement. The loss of the aid would have little effect on
the airport's operations, he said.
