   A jury's finding that the federal government and
Massachusetts Port Authority were to blame for the 1982 crash of a
World Airways jet here came as surprise, the airline's attorney says.
   The U.S. District Court jury Tuesday exonerated World Airways in
the crash, in which a DC-10 carrying 105 passengers and 12 crew
members slid off an icy runway at Logan International Airport. Two
passengers were presumed killed and 39 were injured.
   World Airways, the federal government and Massport, which
operates Logan, have blamed each other for the accident.
   David W. Davis, executive director of Massport which operates
Logan, could not immediately say whether the agency would appeal
Tuesday's verdict.
   ``I felt very strongly and still feel that the principal cause of
the accident was pilot error but for whatever reason the jury has
felt differently and we're going to have to go on from there,''
Davis said.
   James Meehan, chief counsel for World Airways, said the decision
was ``a wonderful and hard-fought victory.''
   ``It took seven years to put the pieces of what happened that
night together,'' Meehan said, ``and finally to lay the
responsibility where it should rest for World Airways and that's
with Massport and the federal government and they fought it all the
way.''
   A new trial to determine who will pay what percentage of damages
was scheduled to begin Feb. 27 in U.S. District Court here.
   Meehan said that although the jury assigned blame to both the
Federal Aviation Administration and Massport, World Airways would
seek to recover damages only from the Port Authority.
   Under federal law, interest on the cost of compensation, the lost
aircraft and the rescue of passengers and crew from the wrecked
aircraft cannot be assessed on the U.S. government.
   ``But we can recover the full amount from Massport and that's
what we intend to do,'' Meehan said.
   Meehan said the ruling came as a pleasant surprise following U.S.
District Judge Robert E. Keeton's 1986 ruling, which found World
Airways 50 percent responsible for the accident, Massport 30 percent
responsible and the federal government 20 percent responsible.
   At the time, Keeton said Massport had failed to close the runway
despite hazardous conditions and that neither it nor the FAA had
informed World Airways that conditions had deteriorated.
   Massport and the federal government have maintained, however,
that the crash was caused by pilot error.
   Keeton made his ruling after a previous jury failed to reach a
verdict and a mistrial was declared.
   Lawyers for both sides said it was not immediately clear how the
divergent decisions would affect one another, but Meehan said
Keeton's ruling was binding solely on the U.S. government.
