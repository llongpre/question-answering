   A decision to boost landing fees for smaller planes at Logan International Airport while slashing them for commercial jetliners is setting the stage for a battle that could affect air travelers throughout the country. 

   The goal of the Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns busy Logan, was simple: to cut delays by inducing commuter airlines and private pilots to switch to bigger planes or better yet to other airports in the Boston area. 
Now Massport is considering other pricing and reservation plans that would give bigger planes preference during rush hours. 

   Supporters laud Massport's moves -- called PACE, or Program for Airport Capacity Efficiency -- as innovative and practical. 
"Where you have this kind of congestion, this is rational," says Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. 
"It's not economically sensible for a plane that lands two people to be on equal footing with one that lands 250." 

   Others disagree. 
"Massport," says Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican who represents central New York, "is thumbing its nose at the little guys." 
What's worse, he says, "Other airports can't wait to do the same thing." 

   In many ways, the Massport controversy is a microcosm of national aviation issues. 
It pits those who believe all planes should be treated the same against those who say big jetliners deserve preference. 
It divides those who believe the airport crunch must be solved by building new runways from those who argue that airport space is limited and should be rationed. 
Like all wrangling over airports, it's a noisy, nasty fight. 

   "Massport has taken a very selfish, narrow perspective," asserts John Baker, president of the politically powerful Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the trade group for private pilots. 
"They treat Logan as a proprietary interest, without a national role, even though they have accepted millions in federal funds." 

   Prodding by Mr. Baker and others, including the Regional Airline Association, which represents commuter airlines, and the National Business Aircraft Association, which represents corporations that own planes, may pay off. 
The U.S. Transportation Department is investigating whether Massport is violating federal law, and Congress is considering denying it $11 million in federal funds. 

   For Massport executive director David Davis, all the fuss obscures a simple issue: Logan, which is expected to handle 37 million passengers annually by the year 2000, up from 23 million last year, will become hopelessly gridlocked without changes. 

   "Airport efficiency," he says, "must be measured by the number of people -- not planes -- who can use the airport with a minimum of delay." 
He predicts the new fee schedule will cut traffic 5%, resulting in a 40% decrease in rush-hour delays. 

   But critics argue that Massport's actions will set an undesirable precedent. 
"If other big airports do the same thing, we'll end up with two dozen mini-CABs {Civil Aeronautics Boards}" deciding who can fly and in what kind of plane, warns Jonathan Howe, president of the business-aircraft group. 
The result, says John Sullivan, president of Brockway Air Inc., a South Burlington, Vt., commuter carrier, will be a "checkerboard of reregulation." 

   Some Massport critics also worry about the prospect of a Dukakis administration. 
The Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor has said he would order Massport-type plans for other congested airports. 
Mr. Davis has been mentioned as a potential Federal Aviation Administration chief. 

   Certainly, Logan's new landing fees have drastically changed the costs of doing business at the airport. 
A Cessna 402, for example, is charged $95.19 to land, up from $25 before July 1, while a Boeing 747-300 is billed $432.51, down from $823.99. 

   For Business Express of Hartford, Conn., a commuter airline affiliated with Delta Air Lines, landing fees at Logan will triple to $1 million a year. 
By contrast, Delta, because it uses big jets, expects to save $1.2 million a year. 

   James McManus, president of Business Express, says the higher fees contributed to a decision to end service between Logan and Augusta, Maine, and may force him to raise fares. 
Precision Airlines, a commuter airline based in Manchester, N.H., has raised fares $8 on all its flights to offset an increase in landing fees. 

   Massport plans to exempt some flights serving smaller communities from the landing-fee increases, but New England lawmakers say the exemptions won't be extensive enough to protect many rural areas from fare increases and service cutbacks. 
They want Massport to drop PACE and consider a new runway for small planes. 
That's an option Massport has rejected for reasons of noise and politics. 

   It's too soon to tell what impact PACE is having on delays, and in any case, the final judgment will be made by the courts and the federal government. 
Groups representing commuter airlines and private pilots are appealing a June ruling by a federal district judge in Boston that upheld the fee changes. 

   Meanwhile, the Senate has voted to deny Massport federal funds if the Transportation Department rules against it and Massport refuses to suspend PACE. 
The provision was written by Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), who contends Logan is being run like a "medieval fiefdom" and that his constituents will be hurt. 

   Rep. Frank is unmoved. 
"In New Hampshire, they're always making a big deal about how wonderful it is to do business there because the taxes are so low," he says, "but that's because of publicly supported places in Massachusetts like Logan."
