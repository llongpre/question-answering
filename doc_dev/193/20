<HEAD>World Airways to Receive $62.9 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Massachusetts Port Authority has been ordered
to pay $62.9 million to World Airways for its liability in a 1982
plane crash at Logan International Airport.
   Massport officials said they would appeal Friday's ruling by
U.S. District Court Judge Robert E. Keeton, who also ruled the
airline could recover an additional $1.6 million from the federal
government.
   In earlier trials, federal juries ruled that the authority and
the Federal Aviation Administration were to blame for the January
1982 crash, which killed two people.
   The DC-10, carrying 212 passengers, attempted to land on an icy
runway at Logan, but slid off the runway and into Boston Harbor.
The nose of the plane was severed from the fuselage and passengers
and crew had to swim in the frigid waters to safety.
   While the juries determined Massport and the federal government
were to blame for not taking adequate safety measures in icy
conditions, the amount of the settlement remained to be determined
and questions of interest remained in dispute until Friday.
   The total set by Keeton takes into account $33 million for the
value of the aircraft, interest over the seven years since the
accident, and several passenger claims, The Boston Globe reported.
   Attorneys in the case told the newspaper that Massport may be
able to recover $11 million of the total settlement from the
federal government because the FAA was also found at fault.
   Other issues in the case still remain unresolved, however.
Keeton must rule on motion for a new trial relating to emotional
distress claimed by crew members.
   The pilot, Peter Langley, and his co-pilot were awarded $2
million in damages in April, but Keeton ruled that that amount was
excessive and planned to reduce it by 80 percent, the newspaper
said.
