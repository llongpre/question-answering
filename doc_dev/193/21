   The House is moving toward final passage of a
bill providing $10.8 billion in new spending for the government's
transportation programs for fiscal 1989, despite a Reagan
administration veto threat.
   Approval of the legislation was expected today, even though
administration officials say rejection of the measure by President
Reagan is possible because it is too expensive.
   The legislation would provide $2 billion above the amount Reagan
requested for transportation programs for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1, and $182 million over the amount provided for this
year. It contains large increases for the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Coast Guard.
   The bill would also allow the government to spend up to an
additional $15.4 billion out of revenues collected each year
specifically for aviation, highway and mass transit programs.
   As usual, the bill also contains a number of highway projects
and other items aimed at particular districts.
   Altogether, the measure would allow $3.1 billion in spending for
the Coast Guard, a 16 percent increase over 1988 levels. At least
$492 million would have to be spent on drug interdiction efforts.
   The Federal Aviation Administration would be entitled to spend
more than $6.6 billion, 15 percent more than this year. Most of the
money would be for the salaries of air traffic controllers and
other workers, new equipment such as radar, and grants to airports
for construction.
   Amtrak, the federally subsidized passenger railroad, would
receive $590 million and mass transit programs would get $3.3
billion.
   It was for those programs that lawmakers differed most radically
from Reagan's proposed budget. The president wanted to terminate
all federal aid to Amtrak, which expects to carry 34 million
passengers next year, and provide mass transit programs with barely
half the amount the House approved.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $10.6 billion
version of the bill last Friday. When the full Senate passes that
legislation, the two chambers will have to agree to a compromise
bill before it is sent to Reagan for his signature.
   When debate on the House bill began Tuesday, lawmakers removed
provisions that might have blocked federal aid to Boston's Logan
International Airport.
   Officials at Logan plan to increase landing fees July 1 for
small aircraft, which they say would reduce delays for airline
passengers by encouraging private and commuter planes to use nearby
airfields. The program is supported by Boston-area legislators.
   Opponents inserted a provision that would have withheld federal
assistance to Logan until the Department of Transportation
completes an investigation of Logan's plan, and until the courts
rule on challenges filed by small aircraft industry groups.
   The provision was removed on procedural grounds, however, after
Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., complained that by House rules,
it should not have been included in a spending bill. Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., who was presiding over the House at the time,
upheld Kennedy's objection. There was no vote.
   Similar provisions blocking aid to Logan remain in the Senate
version of the transportation bill.
   The House bill would also attempt to block a private developer's
plans to build a shopping mall in Manassas, Va., on part of what
was the scene of the Second Battle of Bull Run, a Confederate
victory during the Civil War. The provision, introduced by Civil
War buff Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., would forbid the government to
approve the construction of exits from highways that serve the area.
