   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a
bill Friday providing $10.6 billion for the government's
transportation programs, despite a veto threat from the Reagan
administration.
   The measure for fiscal 1989, sent to the full Senate on a voice
vote, would also allow spending of up to an additional $14.4
billion from the revenues the government collects each year for
aviation, highway and mass transit programs. The fiscal year begins
Oct. 1.
   Under the legislation, the government would spend $6.6 billion
for the Federal Aviation Administration, an increase of $800
million over this year. Spending for the Coast Guard would grow
$350 million to $3 billion, of which $492 million would be set
aside for drug interdiction work.
   In a continuation of a perennial dispute between the
administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress, the
committee ignored a White House request to slash spending for mass
transit and eliminate federal aid to Amtrak, the passenger railroad.
   Instead, the committee would provide $581 million for Amtrak and
$3.2 billion for mass transit.
   James C. Miller III, director of the president's Office of
Management and Budget, sent letters Thursday to committee members,
saying he would urge President Reagan to veto the legislation.
   Miller complained that the measure would allow $2.3 billion in
spending more than the president wants. He also objected to the
mass transit and Amtrak spending, and the inclusion of about $25
million for local highway projects lawmakers had tucked into the
bill.
   The legislators accepted an amendment on voice vote by Sen.
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., aimed at blocking Logan International
Airport in Boston from imposing higher landing fees on small
aircraft.
   In an effort to reduce congestion for airline passengers by
encouraging private planes to use suburban airfields, Logan
officials have scheduled the higher fees to take effect July 1.
   Rudman's provision would halt federal aid to the airport unless
officials agreed to hold off the increases until the Department of
Transportation completes an inquiry on the pricing structure, and
until lawsuits seeking to block the higher costs are settled.
   The House is scheduled to vote next week on a $10.9 billion
version of the spending bill.
