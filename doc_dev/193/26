   Senate and House negotiators must square the
differences between the fiscal 1989 transportation appropriations
bills that both chambers have now passed, but their work is already
shadowed by a threatened veto over appropriations for mass transit
and Amtrak.
   The Senate passed its version of the legislation Tuesday, a
$10.6 billion measure that ignores President Reagan's efforts to
rein in federal spending for local mass transit systems and for
Amtrak, the passenger railroad. The vote was 91-6.
   Reagan administration officials, complaining that the bill would
spend $2.3 billion more than the president believes is justified,
say they will urge him to veto the measure.
   The next step is for House and Senate bargainers to reach a
compromise on the measure, which covers the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1. The House passed a $10.8 billion version of the bill on
June 29.
   The Senate bill would allow expenditures of an additional $14.3
billion from taxes that are collected on fuels and other items and
are set aside for aviation, highway and mass transit programs.
   Mass transit programs would receive nearly $3.2 billion under
the legislation, double what Reagan wants. The legislation also
would provide $581 million to Amtrak, the federally subsidized
passenger railroad.
   The bill would bring spending for the Coast Guard to $3 billion,
provide $6.5 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, and
set aside $11.6 billion for highway programs.
   As usual, the legislation contains pet projects for the home
states of members of the Appropriations Committee. Among them are
$35 million for work on Route 1 in New Jersey, home state of
Democratic Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg; $16 million for a road project
in Buckhannon and Upshur counties in West Virginia, home of Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd; and $4 million for a bridge in Nashua,
N.H., home of Republican Sen. Warren Rudman.
   The bill would make it harder for a developer to build a
shopping mall and other buildings on a parcel of land in Manassas,
Va., that was part of the battlefield of the Second Battle of Bull
Run, an 1862 Confederate victory. It would forbid the federal
government to approve the construction of highway interchanges in
the area.
   The legislation also would prohibit Boston's Logan airport from
receiving federal assistance unless its system of higher landing
fees for small planes receives a green light from the Department of
Transportation. The case is considered a harbinger for how other
major, congested airports around the nation will handle private
aviation in future years.
   Logan officials raised landing fees for private and commuter
aircraft on July 1, trying to encourage the smaller planes to use
suburban airfields and ease congestion for airline passengers.
   The amendment would require the Transportation Department to
decide by Dec. 5 whether the new charges discriminate against small
aircraft users. If the agency decides against the new fees, federal
aid to Logan will be withheld unless airport officials change their
plan.
   An amendment was included to suspend for one year the penalties
leveled against states whose motorists consistently ignore the 55
mph speed limit.
   If authorities find that more than half the drivers monitored
are driving above 55 mph, a state can lose up to 10 percent of its
federal highway aid. That requirement, however, was not extended to
states that raised their maximum driving speeds to 65 mph under a
federal law passed last year, an omission that has sparked
complaints of unfairness by lawmakers from 55 mph states.
   The amendment, sponsored by Sens. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., was approved on a voice vote. New York
is one of three states _ the others are California and North Dakota
_ whose drivers have been found to have been driving too fast, and
which risk losing some of their federal road assistance.
   Moynihan said the one-year suspension would give Congress a
chance to make the law more consistent.
