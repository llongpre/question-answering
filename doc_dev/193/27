   The sniper who fired an assault rifle into
downtown Boston from a small airplane thwarted five different law
enforcement agencies with instant communications, state-of-the-art
helicopters and sophisticated radar.
   Murder suspect Alfred Hunter was captured early Wednesday when
he landed a stolen plane at Logan International Airport after a
three-hour flight, just five minutes before the Cessna would have
run out of fuel.
   Jet helicopters owned by state police could easily have
overtaken the Cessna, if officials had decided to use them, said
Trooper David F. Morrill.
   ``Why risk a helicopter chasing an armed person in an
airplane?'' Morrill asked. ``All a helicopter is going to be able
to do is follow him. We did that anyway with the radar. If you get
up there and engage in a shooting match, all you do is endanger
other people.''
   State police, the Federal Aviation Administration, the
Massachusetts Port Authority which operates Logan Airport,
emergency response crews and three local police departments were
responded to Hunter's three-hour escapade.
   Airports all over Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire were
alerted.
   Like the feat of Mathias Rust, the 19-year-old West German who
flew through elaborate Soviet border security in a single-engine
Cessna and buzzed Red Square before landing there, Hunter's buzzing
the control tower at Logan Airport and swooping under the Tobin
Bridge stunned law enforcement officials.
   Longtime law enforcment officials said they had never seen
anything like it.
   ``We could do nothing but wait and try to guess where he was
going to land,'' said Logan Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella. ``We
could only have made things worse by going up and chasing him.''
   ``What if you shoot the guy down and he crashes into a house or
something?'' said Morrill, noting that for much of the time Hunter
was flying low over heavily populated areas. ``It just isn't
feasible. You basically have to hope he runs out of fuel.''
   FAA officials tracking Hunter from Logan's control tower twice
had to scramble out of their perch because the Cessna came so close
they feared it would crash into the tower.
   ``We have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic
control, but there's nothing in there about what to do if a maniac
comes shooting an AK-47 at you in the control tower,'' said John
Leyden, an FAA spokesman in Washington.
