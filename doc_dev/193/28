   Snowy owls, a solitary species of beautiful birds
from frozen tundra far to the north, are returning to their winter
home near one of the nation's noisiest airports and one of its most
polluted harbors.
   The unusual gathering seems largely due to reminders of home and
an abundant food supply at the 1,800 acres of open field at Logan
International Airport, said Bradford Blodget, of the state Division
of Fisheries and Wildlife.
   ``Massachusetts is probably one of the best places in the entire
country to see snowy owls,'' Blodget said. ``Probably the largest
concentration in the state is out at Logan.''
   In addition to providing a curious counterpoint to the modern
surroundings, the white birds are doing their part to clean up the
much-maligned Boston Harbor by feasting on the water rats populating
the grasslands between the runways and the water.
   More than 35 of the solitary, 20-inch-long, often brown-specked
owls perched on radio towers and swooped silently out over the water
and runways during their last December-to-March visit.
   Norman Smith, of the Massachusetts Audubon Society, banded 36
snowy owls at Logan for the first time last season. The birds, which
travel individually, start their trek south in November and continue
to migrate until January.
   So far this year, Smith has sighted three birds. The small number
could be part of a migratory pattern, or more birds could come as
the season progresses, he said.
   Smith is the state's snowy owl expert, but he concedes it is
difficult to say what draws them from the quiet desolation of the
tundra in Greenland and northern Canada to the chaotic environment
of the airport.
   ``Nobody really knows why they migrate,'' Smith said. ``Some
people try to correlate it to the drop in the Lemming supply (which
the owls feed on), some try to correlate it to the weather.''
   Smith said he believes it's just a normal migratory pattern that
draws the snowy owls south to the airport, where the noisy planes
don't disturb the birds.
   ``For the most part they ignore them,'' he said. ``Owls have
sensitive hearing, but the jet noise doesn't seem to phase them at
all.''
   The owls go about their lives at the airport much like they would
in the barren expanses of home, with a few extra activities, Smith
said.
   ``They roost primarily on the ground. And they seem to be most
active just before sunset and very active at night,'' Smith said.
   Sometimes they perch amid discarded ramps, buses and structures
rusting in an isolated section of the airfield, and occasionally the
owls venture out to the harbor islands.
   ``In the evenings, I've actually seen them fly to downtown
Boston,'' Smith said, adding that the owls perch on roof tops and
eat the rats scurrying near open dumpsters in alleys.
   Although the noise from the planes doesn't bother the owls, Bob
D'Entremont, an airport employee since 1971 who has watched the
falcons, blue heron and geese that populate Logan, said the airport
is not always safe for the owls _ they often sit on the white lines
of the runways to blend in.
   ``We lose a couple a year. A couple get hit,'' said D'Entremont,
who said he has spotted snowy owls at Logan since 1975.
   Logan is not the only place snowy owls congregate in the United
States. The birds travel along the seaboard and live along marshes
and fields. A large seasonal population can be found at Plum Island
off Newburyport.
   A Logan owl was once tracked to Rhode Island, and John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York reports five or six snowy owls a
year.
