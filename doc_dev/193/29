A Los Angeles-bound American Airlines flight carrying 165 people returned to 
Logan International Airport for an emergency landing this morning when smoke 
was detected in a rear cargo bin, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers and crew used emergency ramps to leave the aircraft after it 
returned without incident about five minutes after takeoff, said spokesman 
Maynard Scarborough of Massport, which operates the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Four people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation and were taken to 
hospitals, Scarborough said. The 156 passengers included four infants; nine 
crew members were also aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke was detected just after the plane left Logan, and it immediately 
returned, landing at 9:23 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline, said she didn't know what might 
have gone wrong after the Airbus A-300 took off. "This is a very reliable 
aircraft . . . and is less than 2 years old," she said.
