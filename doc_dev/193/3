   A federal judge Wednesday ruled that dramatic
increases in landing fees for small aircraft at Logan International
Airport are not discriminatory and can be implemented as planned on
Friday.
   The Massachusetts Port Authority, the independent agency that
runs the airport, had announced the new fees in March to reduce
airport congestion by encouraging small planes to use suburban
airfields.
   ``The objectives of the airport to reduce delays are rationally
related to government interests,'' U.S. District Judge A. David
Mazzone said. ``I cannot say that the assignment (of the fees) was
an arbitrary, irrational, non-uniform assignment.''
   Lawyers representing owners of small aircraft and commuter
airlines said they had not decided whether to appeal.
   The New England Legal Foundation, a non-profit organization
specializing in government regulation of business, had argued that
the fee increase violates laws requiring equal access to federally
supported airports. They also alleged the fees violate
constitutional guarantees against discrimination.
   Wayne Henderson, a lawyer for the foundation, said he was
``obviously disappointed ... but it's a close call as the judge
said.''
   The fees are based on a combination of airplanes' weight and
other operating costs. While fees for large jets actually would go
down, fliers of smaller aircraft would pay as much as 250 percent
more.
   Under the new fees, all planes at Logan will be assessed an $88
flat fee and 47 cents per 1,000 pounds. Currently, planes are
assessed $1.31 per 1,000 pounds or $25, whichever is greater. Most
small planes pay $25.
   The fee for a Boeing 747 would drop to $408 from $680, while a
Cessna 402 seating 10 passengers will pay $96 compared to the
current $25.
   The legal foundation represented commuter airlines in the New
England area. Also appearing in court were lawyers for the National
Business Aircraft Association and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association.
   The landing fees were approved after a crowded, highly charged
hearing. Among those applauding the increase were residents living
next to the airport, who see it as a way to reduce noise and the
potential for accidents.
   Logan averages 90 takeoffs and landings an hour, according to
MassPort. The Federal Aviation Administration ranks Logan among the
nation's 10 most congested airports.
   MassPort executive director David Davis called the decision a
ruling of national importance. ``It's a larger victory because the
judge supported the position of the authority's right'' to set
fees, he said.
   In a related development, the U.S. House on Tuesday removed
provisions in a $10.8 billion spending package for federal
transportation that might have blocked federal aid to Logan because
of the new fees.
   Opponents of the fee hike had inserted a provision to withhold
money from Logan until the U.S. Transportation Department finishes
investigating Massport's plan and the court ruled. The DOT review
is not due until November.
   The provision was deleted after Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,
D-Mass., complained it had no place in a spending bill. The bill
passed the House and went to the Senate. Similar provisions
blocking aid to Logan remain in the Senate version.
