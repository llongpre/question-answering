   The bizarre flight of an enraged ex-husband who
commandeered a Cessna and flew among city buildings while firing
randomly at the ground below reminded operators of small airports
of their vulnerablility.
   ``What can you do to prevent someone from going in and
terrorizing people?'' asked John Leyden, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman.
   ``You just have to play the odds,'' said Greg Chapman, manager
of the Beverly municipal airport where the gunman hijacked the
small plane. ``You go along for years and years and nothing
happens. Then all of a sudden everything goes haywire.''
   Alfred J. Hunter, who also is accused of murdering his ex-wife,
was arraigned Wednesday in Salem District Court on charges of
murder and armed robbery. Judge John Doyle ordered Hunter held
without bail for 20 days of psychiatric observation at Bridgwater
State Hospital.
   The sniper flight early Wednesday struck a chord among airport
officials struggling with security.
   The rampage began with the hijacking of the single-engine plane
at Beverly, about 20 miles north of Boston. The episode ended three
hours later at Logan International Airport, one of the nation's
largest facilities.
   At both facilities, the hijacker had officials backed into a
corner.
   In Beverly, flight instructor Robert Golder was alone and had
little choice but to comply with Hunter's demand for a plane.
   ``When you have an AK-47 (assault rifle) stuck up your nose and
someone ask you to provide an airplane, you just ask them what
color airplane they'd like,'' Amero said. ``It's wise to back off.''
   And during the flight, Hunter buzzed Logan and sent air traffic
controllers scrambling from the tower, closing the airport.
   ``Something like this was impossible to anticipate in terms of
security,'' said Phil Orlandella, a spokesman for Logan. ``And I'm
not sure there's a defense for it anyway. The whole city was
helpless.''
   Hunter's flight ended about 1:15 a.m. Wednesday when he landed
at Logan with about five minutes' worth of fuel left in his tank.
He had no comment, and authorities found no weapon in the plane
although several rounds and spent shell casings were recovered.
   Leyden said that ideally, stringent security measures would be
mandated at all of the nation's 15,000 small airports and landing
strips.
   ``But it would be impossible,'' he said. ``You really can't
prepare for events like these. I don't know what you could do in
the way of security without imposing a tremendous economic burden
on small airport operators.''
   Ralph Amero, who manages the Beverly Flight Center, whose plane
Hunter commandeered, agreed.
   ``At airports such as Beverly there really is no security,'' he
said. ``Generally speaking all we can do is band together as a
group of fixed base operators and try to hire security, but the
cost is prohibitive.''
   Bill Thomas, a senior claims representative at AVEMCO Insurance
Corp. said the Frederick, Md.-based small aircraft insurer, one of
the nation's largest, receives eight to 10 theft reports annually.
   Because a single-engine plane like a Cessna 210 is valued at
about $196,000, costs can quickly soar for insurers like AVEMCO,
which spends about $1 million annually in compensation for stolen
and damaged aircraft.
   ``The Boston incident was certainly an exception,'' he said.
``Naturally, we like to see solid security using the best
surveillance technology.''
