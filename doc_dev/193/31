   Congress sent a $10.8 billion transportation
spending bill for 1989 to the White House on Wednesday, several
days after lawmakers made it veto-proof by removing language
airline labor unions had championed.
   The House gave final congressional approval to the measure on a
voice vote shortly after the Senate signed off on the bill with a
voice vote of its own. The House had given initial approval to the
measure Tuesday on a 392-13 vote, but had to consider it again
after the Senate made last-minute technical amendments.
   Reagan was expected to sign the legislation by Saturday, the
start of the 1989 federal fiscal year. It is the eighth
appropriations bill the president has received as lawmakers rush to
send Reagan all 13 spending measures before the new year begins.
   Last Thursday, House-Senate negotiators sliced labor-sought
language out of the bill that Reagan had said would cause him to
veto the entire measure.
   That provision, included in the House version of the bill
approved earlier this year, would have required airlines to pay
benefits to employees whose jobs are lost or whose incomes are
diminished due to mergers.
   Besides providing $10.8 billion in new spending for fiscal 1989,
the appropriations bill would allow the government to spend another
$14.7 billion on transportation programs, money that would come
from various federal taxes on fuel and air travel.
   The bill would funnel $3.2 billion to mass transit, $12.2
billion to highway programs, $6.3 billion to aviation and $2.8
billion to the Coast Guard. Among other things, it provides $584
million in grants for Amtrak, the national passenger railroad.
   The legislation not only would spend $2.6 billion more on
transportation than Reagan proposed in the budget he gave Congress
in February, but also rearranges the priorities he sought.
   In a battle that Reagan has waged with congressional Democrats
since the early 1980s, the president preferred dramatically less
spending for mass transit, slightly less for highways, slightly
more for aviation and no money at all for Amtrak.
   Despite those differences, the provision that most piqued the
president was the one protecting airline workers. Supporters argued
that in an era of frequent mergers, workers' jobs must be
protected. The administration considered it an intrusion into the
workings of the free market.
   The legislation contains sections that would block the
construction of a shopping mall in Manassas, Va., near the site of
two important Civil War battles, and prohibit the government from
withholding federal highway aid for states whose drivers disobey
the 55 mph speed limit. Legislation passed last year allowing
states to increase their speed limits to 65 mph dropped such
sanctions for those states.
   The measure would also allow Logan International Airport in
Boston temporarily to continue new, higher landing fees for small
airplanes to encourage them to use other airfields.
   The bill would allow Logan to continue receiving federal aid
until the federal Department of Transportation completes an
investigation of the controversial program. If the agency
determines that the Logan plan is illegal, government assistance to
the airport would be halted.
