   A British Airways flight bound for Miami from
London made an emergency landing at Logan International Airport on
Saturday after an anonymous caller threatened that a bomb would
explode in flight.
   The Boeing 747 jet landed without incident shortly before 3
p.m., said Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the Massachusetts Port
Authority.
   The 341 passengers and 19 crew members exited by a stairway that
had been wheeled to the plane on a runway apron away from the main
terminal. No injuries were reported.
   British Airways received the threat in London, about four hours
after the plane departed, said John Lampl, an airline spokesman. An
anonymous caller said a bomb aboard the jet was set to explode at
27,000 feet, but the plane was already at 31,000 feet above
Labrador in Canada.
   ``The threat had passed,'' Lampl said, but the plane's captain
decided to divert to Boston as a precaution.
   ``The most important thing is the safety of the passengers,'' he
said.
   After the plane landed, state police searched the aircraft with
the help of explosives-sniffing canines, but they found no
immediate sign of a bomb.
   Passengers were taken to the international air terminal, where
Lampl said they were going through customs and immigration and then
would be placed on other flights to Miami.
