   A distraught man who allegedly had just killed his
ex-wife commandeered a small plane and held the city hostage for
three hours early Wednesday, firing a semiautomatic weapon while
flying within 50 feet of motorists and buildings.
   ``We could do nothing but wait and try to guess where he was
going to land,'' airport spokesman Phil Orlandella said. ``We could
only have made things worse by going up and chasing him.''
   Traffic controllers at Logan International Airport said the
pilot buzzed them repeatedly, forcing officials to close the
airport for an hour and reroute several late-night flights.
Controllers fled the tower twice.
   ``We have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic
control, but there's nothing in there about what to do if a maniac
comes shooting an AK-47 at you in the control tower,'' said John
Leyden, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Washington.
   ``We didn't know if he was on drugs ... drunk, or if he was
suicidal,'' said Orlandella of the Massachusetts Port Authority,
which operates Logan. ``We had not one word of radio contact
throughout the whole flight.''
   Alfred J. Hunter, 42, pleaded innocent Wednesday in Salem to one
count each of murder and armed robbery after a midnight flight that
reportedly included a dip beneath a harbor bridge. Essex County
District Judge John T. Doyle ordered Hunter held without bail at
Bridgewater State Hospital for 20 days of psychiatric observation.
   Hunter made no comments when he was captured, police said.
   Bullets struck a variety of targets, including parked cars and
the Prudential tower's 50th-floor skywalk.
   One pedestrian was struck by ejected casings from the spent
rounds.
   FAA Field Manager Richard Fontz said Hunter was not a licensed
pilot but had apparently had some instruction from his father.
   ``It obviously wasn't the first time he flew an airplane,''
Fontz said.
   Hunter also repeatedly buzzed the post office where he worked,
Fontz said. ``The diving he was doing among the buildings and under
the bridge was something.''
   The sniper flight began at 10:20 p.m. Tuesday and for the next
three hours ambulance services tried to anticipate where the pilot
might land so they could prepare for possible injuries.
   Police in Boston received more than 200 calls from people
reporting the sound of gunfire. In suburban Lynn, police said two
cars were hit by a shower of shots believed fired from the
zig-zagging plane.
   Andrew Smith said he was walking along fashionable Newbury
Street in the city's Back Bay section when he heard popping noises
from the sky.
   ``About two seconds later, several shell casings landed all
around. At that point I realized that the guy was shooting out of
his plane,'' said Smith, who notified police. ``Nobody believed me
at first. I didn't believe it at first,''
   Trooper Barbara Bennett said officials decided to wait until the
gunman ran out of fuel rather than send up a state police
helicopter. If the plane had been shot at, she said, it could have
endangered the public.
   Hunter landed briefly at Logan at 12:57 a.m. but took off again.
He landed again 17 minutes later and was captured after a minor
scuffle, Bennett said.
   Two shell casings and two live shells were found in the
two-seater Cessna, which had about five minutes of fuel left.
Police found no weapon and said it probably was discarded during
the flight. They also said there was no way to tell how many shots
were fired.
   The ammunition was like that used in a semiautomatic assault
rifle such as an AK-47, said State Police Cpl. Joseph Howley. He
said it would not be possible to determine te type of weapon used
from the ammunition alone.
   Earlier Tuesday, Hunter, a mail handler, was given one year's
probation for assaulting his 26-year-old ex-wife, Elvira, in
December 1988 in an argument triggered when he ordered her not to
change a television channel.
   Hunter was convicted of assault and battery, making threats and
violating a restraining order his wife sought in January 1988. The
couple divorced in May 1988.
   Hunter's only previous criminal conviction stemmed from a 1979
incident in which he pleaded guilty to assaulting a group of people
with a machete. He told the court they tried to rob him, and was
sentenced to a year's probation.
   Police said they believe that on Tuesday night Hunter went to
his ex-wife's home and shot her in front of their 5-year-old son
before launching his aerial attack.
   Hunter then commandeered a car, and demanded and got a plane at
the small municipal airport straddling the Beverly-Danvers border
about 20 miles north of Boston.
   ``(It) was the last thing I was expecting. I was basically in
shock,'' said Robert Golder, 21, a flight instructor. ``He wanted
me to start the airplane for him. He told me not to do anything
stupid. He said he had just killed some people.''
