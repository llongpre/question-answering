   A husband-wife tiff aboard an airliner escalated
to a fight among several passengers and led to the arrest of six
people from the Continental Airlines plane at Logan International
Airport.
   ``They had a little brawl,'' state police Cpl. Joseph Howley
said of the weekend incident aboard an MD-80 jet with 146
passengers aboard.
   ``It started out as a husband and wife that were sort of running
around the plane and making demands on the crew and being a general
nuisance and hollering,'' Howley said.
   Officials available today were unable to say if blows were
exchanged on the flight Saturday, but said the husband struggled
with police who arrested him in the airport terminal.
   Facing arraignment today on a variety of charges are Steven
Sacks-Wilner, 39, attorney for Republicans in the New Jersey
Senate, and his wife, Joane, 37. Also arrested were a Medford,
Mass., family, Frank J. Federico, 50, his wife, Camella, 48, and
their son John, 22, and John's girlfriend, Laureen Belmonte.
   Sacks-Wilner is charged with interfering with a flight crew,
being a disorderly person and three counts of assault on a police
officer for allegedly resisting officers at the gate. The others
were charged with interfering with a flight crew.
   The Massachusetts State Police say the fracas aboard the flight
took place when the plane was in the air, and forced the pilot to
abort the landing Saturday evening.
   But airline spokesman Ned Walker insisted the fight took place
on the ground, and that the pilot aborted his first landing attempt
because another plane was slow to taxi out of the way.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigting, said
Michael Ciccarelli, a spokesman in Boston. He said the agency was
told the pilot made a routine manuever for a second landing because
the plane ahead was slow to clear the runway.
