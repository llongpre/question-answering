   A Boston effort to relieve runway congestion
by increasing landing fees for small planes is evolving into a
national debate over the role of major airports.
   What was a local dispute involving Logan International Airport
has spilled over to Congress, the Department of Transportation and
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``This is just the first foot over the line,'' said Rep.
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who has introduced legislation designed
to block Logan from implementing the plan. ``There are airports all
over the country sort of foaming at the mouth, just waiting to
follow suit.''
   But Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said that ``deteriorating
air traffic gridlock'' justifies Logan's goal of encouraging small
aircraft to use other airfields in the area, saying, ``It's a
balancing of equities.''
   Logan faces a problem common to many airports: Air traffic and
delays are growing, but expansion is unrealistic because of
neighborhood opposition, a lack of available land and enormous
construction costs.
   So the Massachusetts Port Authority, or Massport, the state
agency that operates Logan, has announced a plan it says will
permit more efficient use of the airport by 23 million passengers
annually.
   As of July 1, landing fees for private planes and commuter
airlines will be increased from the current minimum of $25 to an
average of close to $100. The costs for large airliners _ now
hundreds of dollars _ will drop by varying amounts.
   ``Massport has concluded that the test of efficiency at Logan is
not the number of airplanes landed per hour, but the number of
people handled per hour with a minimum of delay,'' the agency's
executive director, David W. Davis, said when the plan was approved
March 16. ``In other words, a 747 with 400 people on board deserves
a higher priority than a Cessna with two people on board.''
   The commuter airline, corporate aircraft and private plane
industries say the Logan plan is unfair because they have as much
right to use the government-supported airport as airlines do. And
the higher fees will hurt their businesses, they say.
   ``We price our service at what we think the market will stand,''
said John Fredericksen, executive vice president of the Regional
Airline Association, which represents the nation's commuter
carriers. ``If we thought that extra money was out there, we'd
charge it.''
   Officials of the small plane industry fear that Logan's plan may
be only the beginning of restrictions across the country.
   Although air traffic grows every year, the last major U.S.
metropolitan airport _ Dallas-Fort Worth International _ was
completed in 1974. No new airports are under construction, although
two cities _ Denver and Austin _ are moving toward building new
ones, and about a dozen others hope to add runways at existing
airfields.
   Since new airports take at least four years to build _ and cost
$1.5 billion to $2 billion _ existing fields are moving to make
better use of what they have. Modern air traffic equipment will
allow more frequent takeoffs and landings, but it is expensive and
in many cases needs further development.
   As delays grow, more airfields are considering shunting some of
their small plane traffic elsewhere by raising fees, particularly
during busy morning and evening hours.
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates
John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports, is expected in
September to impose slight rush hour increases in takeoff fees for
small planes.
   Massport spokesman Tom Champion declined to name airports that
have contacted his agency but conceded, ``There are a lot of people
watching us with great interest.''
   Said Fredericksen of the regional airline group, ``Our concern
is that airports will try to limit traffic, rather than expand
capacity.''
   Boehlert's bill, and an identical Senate version co-sponsored by
seven Northeastern lawmakers, face uncertain futures. The 1988
congressional schedule is a short one, and committee chairmen say
they have not decided whether to even hold hearings for the
legislation.
   But Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., a private plane pilot, said he will
try attaching an amendment to a spending bill this month that would
kill the Logan plan and discourage other airports from adopting
similar restrictions.
   ``This is a national airspace system, and here we have one
airport trying to make policy,'' he said.
   Opponents of the Logan program have opened other fronts. Small
plane industry groups have filed federal lawsuits in Boston and
also have asked the FAA and Transportation Department to step in on
their behalf.
   Supporters of Logan's efforts say, however, that similar plans
are inevitable.
   ``It's the wave of the future,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y. ``As the skies get more crowded, rational pricing policies
will be imposed at other airports, and Logan is blazing the trail.''
