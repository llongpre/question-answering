   Federal agents carried a test bomb, hand grenade
and gun through American Airlines security at Logan International
Airport in 1987, the government charges in a lawsuit against the
airline.
   The lawsuit alleging 25 violations of federal regulations was
filed Thursday by Jeremiah O'Sullivan, the acting U.S. attorney for
Massachusetts.
   Al Becker, a spokesman for American Airlines at its corporate
headquarters in Dallas, said it would be inappropriate for him to
comment on the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit said that on June 22, 1987, a Federal Aviation
Administration inpsector went through the airline's X-ray system at
the airport ``with a test pipe bomb and a hand grenade in his
carry-on luggage.''
   Another agent had a gun in an attache case, the lawsuit said, and
``the screener, who was not paying attention to the screen while the
encapsulated weapon passed through the X-ray system, failed to
detect the weapon.''
   Test weapons are made of materials similar to real weapons and
should look the same on X-ray machines, the U.S. attorney's office
said.
   On the same day the agents made the tests, a federal agent saw 22
passengers go through American Airlines security ``without the
employee looking through the monitor,'' the lawsuit said.
   It also said only one employee was working the security gate that
day. Airlines are required to have both a monitor for X-ray machines
and a supervisor on duty at all times.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Robbins, who is handling the
case, said that under FAA procedures, airlines are notified of
security violations shortly after they are detected, and ``some are
filed (as civil complaints), and some are not.''
   The lawsuit seeks the maximum $1,000 fine for each of the 25
alleged security violations.
   Last December, a bomb planted on a Pan American jet exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the
ground.
   ``Passengers have a right to expect that the airlines to which
they are paying large amounts of money are taking their security
obligation seriously and are paying attention to what they are
doing,'' O'Sullivan said.
   Becker said American Airlines has ``very elaborate, very
rigorous'' security at every airport it serves, he said, but
acknowledged, ``I know nothing about our system at Logan in
particular.''
   Workers at the American Airlines desk at Logan declined to
comment.
   Becker said the airline has been fined for security lapses in the
past and that most airlines have some documented security violations.
