   With storms lashing the West and the Southeast and air fares
climbing today, many Americans headed home early for Thanksgiving to
get a jump on the busiest travel day of the year, and officials
braced for millions more.
   ``Everybody here knows it's going to be extra busy around this
time, so we put some extra people on,'' said Debra Ingram, a
spokeswoman at Newark (N.J.) International Airport, where traffic
was heavy Tuesday. ``Other than that, we just pray a lot.''
   The Western storm howled into Oregon with 75 mph winds and dumped
heavy rain on northern California on Tuesday, delaying San Francisco
flights up to two hours, causing officials in New York to hold
departures for that city and snarling commuter traffic.
   Four Trees, Calif., in the northern Sierra Nevada, received nine
inches of rain in the 24 hours ending at 4 a.m. The rain was
expected to continue through tonight.
   In the East, Tropical Storm Keith hit Florida's west coast today
with 65 mph winds and heavy rain.
   Officials at major Florida airports did not expect the foul
weather to affect holiday travel. ``We anticipate the airplanes will
be able to slip by the storm on the side or fly over it,'' said Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport spokesman Jim Reynolds.
   The Western storm was expected to dump as much as 36 inches of
snow in the Sierra Nevada, including up to 18 inches around Lake
Tahoe, and leave heavy snow in most mountain areas of the West as it
spread to the northern Plains today. Wind gusts of more than 50 mph
were reported overnight in Redding, Calif.
   ``We've got about an inch (of snow) already,'' Trudy England, who
runs England's Lodging in Government Gamp, Ore., about five miles
south of Mount Hood, said Tuesday night. ``It's cold and snowing
steadily, so we expect more.''
   Eight inches of snow fell overnight at Stampede Pass in the
Snoqualmie National Forest of central Washington.
   Motorists in parts of the West were urged to check travel
conditions before setting out on long Thanksgiving journeys or to
prepare for mid-winter driving.
   Nationally, authorities were braced for a holiday jam of
motorists today. The Highway Patrol planned a ``turkey watch'' in
the desert outside Los Angeles for those violating speed, safety
belt and other traffic laws.
   The National Safety Council said 450 to 550 people may die in
traffic accidents between 6 p.m. Wednesday and midnight Sunday.
During a non-holiday, four-day weekend, about 390 people could
expect to be killed. Last year, 494 people died during Thanksgiving
weekend.
   For air travelers, the cost of flying went up at midnight Tuesday.
   The nation's biggest airlines went ahead with plans announced
last week to boost their lowest discount air fares and eliminate
cheap fares that can be booked a few days in advance. Among those
making the changes were United Airlines, American Airlines,
Northwest Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
   The new fares were not expected to affect the volume of
Thanksgiving travel, Delta spokesman Bill Berry said at the
carrier's Atlanta headquarters.
   ``Those fares going into effect require advance purchase, so they
will be for later travel,'' Berry said. ``The people traveling this
weekend made their reservations some time ago.''
   Officials prepared for a flood of fliers.
   More than 200,000 passengers today were expected to pass through
the nation's busiest airport, Chicago's O'Hare International. On a
normal day, 120,000 to 150,000 use the airport. The Chicago Transit
Authority planned longer trains and more fare handlers for rides
from downtown to O'Hare.
   At Boston's Logan International Airport, 78,000 travelers were
expected, an increase of 30 percent from the normal number. The
Massachusetts Port Authority planned extra buses, vans and water
shuttles and urged fliers to ride instead of drive to Logan to
minimize airport traffic jams.
   At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, about 136,000
passengers were anticipated, up from 105,000 normally.
   At Newark International on Tuesday night, Zelder Hillard,
arriving from Charlotte, N.C., to visit relatives in Paterson, N.J.,
said 35 people couldn't make her flight from North Carolina because
of the crush of travel.
   Ms. Hillard said Piedmont Airlines offered passengers a free
round-trip ticket anywhere in the United States if they would give
up their seats.
   ``Most of the people seemed to want to get home,'' Ms. Hillard,
20, said. ``Only about three or four people gave up their seats.''
