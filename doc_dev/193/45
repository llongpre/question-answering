   A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday extended an
order forcing rival airlines to honor agreements governing ticket,
baggage and cargo transfers essential to keeping strike-crippled
Eastern Airlines airborne.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland also barred striking
Machinists from picketing on Eastern property at Logan
International Airport in Boston.
   Separately, a federal appeals court in Miami told a lower court
to reconsider the airline's request that it force Eastern pilots
back to work.
   Earlier, Continental Airlines' flight attendants terminated a
four-day strike that had little apparent effect on Eastern's sister
carrier.
   The developments came on the 21st day of a walkout by the
8,500-member Machinists union being honored by pilots and flight
attendants. Eastern is operating a limited schedule on its
Northeast shuttle and on Latin and South American routes.
   In New York, Eastern attorneys said in bankruptcy court that the
airline was negotiating with rivals to maintain interline
agreements that allow passengers and bags to make connecting
flights on different carriers.
   Eastern said that without cooperation among carriers, its few
services would be crippled. The pacts do not govern agreements with
other airlines honoring Eastern tickets purchased before the strike.
   Lifland granted a two-week extension to an order that
competitors honor the agreements.
   ``We've had very substantial discussions and negotiations with
the major carriers,'' said Eastern's vice president for marketing,
George J. Brennan. ``They're all willing to resolve this.''
   Lifland also barred picketing on a 150-yard-long sidewalk in
front of Eastern's terminal at Logan International Airport after
the airline complained Machinists were trespassing on private
property.
   In Houston, Union of Flight Attendants spokeswoman Myra Clayton
said the union was notifying flight attendants at Eastern's sister
airline, Continental, to return to work.
   Continental said no flights were disrupted or canceled because
of the walkout. It said 200 flight attendants took part; the union
reported more than 1,200 strikers.
   The union, which represents more than 6,000 flight attendants,
called the walkout Monday to protest what it said were substandard
wages and working conditions at the carrier.
   In Miami, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told a lower
court judge that he had the authority to rule whether the walkout
by Eastern's 3,600 pilots constitutes a primary or secondary strike.
   Eastern earlier this month asked the judges to overturn a lower
court ruling permitting the Air Line Pilots Association to honor
striking Machinists' picket lines under the Railway Labor Act of
1926.
   ``A claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used as a pretext to
shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the
Railway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said.
   It said U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis has the authority to
rule on what kind of strike the pilots are engaged in.
   The ALPA said it is buying advertising this weekend in major
newspapers in Miami, Atlanta, Washington, Boston and New York to
publicize its position and deter other pilots from going to work
for Eastern.
   The advertisement describes the alleged pitfalls of working for
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air. Corp.,
including limited career opportunities and low pay scales, and
says: ``Pilots choose your career opportunities wisely.''
