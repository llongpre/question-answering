   A Trump Shuttle jet carrying 56 people skidded to
a halt with a spray of sparks and smoke today in an emergency
landing at Logan Airport after its nose wheel failed to extend. No
injuries were reported.
   Fire equipment circled the plane and sprayed it with foam after
the Boeing 727 from New York's LaGuardia Airport ground to a halt.
Passengers slid down emergency chutes and walked to a waiting bus
for a ride to the terminal.
   ``When they first said they had problems, everybody was just
kind of joking about it,'' said a passenger, Charlie Cormay of
Sudbury. ``Once we realized there was going to be a crash landing,
everybody got pretty solemn.''
   As the plane came in for a landing, Cormay said, ``a few
prayers'' went through his mind. ``I looked out the window and saw
all the emergency vehicles. That's when I realized it was actually
pretty serious.''
   Before the landing, the plane circled nearly an hour, dumping
fuel. The pilot also tried to shake the wheel loose from its
housing by dropping the plane onto a runway, but the attempt failed
and the jet took to the air again.
   ``They made one sweep but it didn't shake loose,'' said Greg
Sullivan, 19, who watched the attempt.
   The plane circled several more times before smoothly dropping
its wing wheels to the runway in a gentle, but ungainly, landing,
its nose scraping the pavement.
   Passengers were told to put their heads in their laps as the jet
came in.
   ``They prepared us very well. By the time we landed, we were all
very happy and relieved,'' said Kathy Hussey of New York City.
``Suddenly you were on the runway with foam on your face and on
your back.''
   ``You prepare yourself for the worst,'' said another passenger,
Glenn Porter of New York. ``But it was really just like a rough
regular landing.''
   The jet carried 49 passengers and seven crew members, said Dee
Clark, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, which
operates Logan.
   Developer Donald Trump inaugurated the Trump shuttle service
June 8 after buying planes and landing rights from Eastern Airlines
for $365 million. The shuttle operates between New York, Boston and
Washington.
   It was the second emergency landing in a little over a week in
the United States involving a landing gear problem.
   On Aug. 2, a Piedmont Airlines Boeing 737 with 100 people aboard
scraped its wing and engine at Greensboro, N.C., after its left
main gear jammed. No one was injured.
