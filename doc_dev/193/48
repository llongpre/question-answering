<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Jet Makes Emergency Landing, No Injuries</HEAD>

   A Northwest Airlines jet with 182 people
on board made an emergency landing Saturday at an airport after the
pilot shut down one engine because of an oil leak. There were no
injuries, officials said.
   The 757 was on the way from Minneapolis to Seattle when it
landed safely at Billings Logan International Airport with one
engine, said Tom Binford, assistant airport manager.
   The plane had developed an oil leak in the right engine and
apparently was losing oil pressure when it landed, Binford said.
   The plane landed safely about 4 p.m., he said.
   Passengers went on to Seattle on other flights, a Northwest
spokeswoman said.
   Big jets like the 757 normally don't land in Billings because
there are not enough potential passengers, but the airport's
runways are wide and long enough to accommodate them, Binford said.
