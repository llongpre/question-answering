   The tail engine of a TWA L-1011 caught fire after
the plane landed at Logan International Airport early today, but
none of the 148 people on board were injured, officials said.
   Firefighters sprayed foam on the engine and evacuated the
passengers, said Phil Orandella, a spokesman for the Massachusetts
Port Authority, which operates the airport.
   TWA Flight 184 from St. Louis, with 139 passengers and nine crew
members, had been uneventful, Orandella said. The cause of the fire
wasn't immediately known.
   ``They noticed the fire when they were taxiing'' to the gate,
Orandella said.
