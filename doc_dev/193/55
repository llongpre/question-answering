   A gunman killed his ex-wife and then commandeered
a small plane and swooped over Boston for three hours, strafing
Logan Airport and firing at baseball fans leaving Fenway Park,
authorities said today.
   Alfred James Hunter III awaited arraignment today on charges of
murdering his former wife, Elvira, in front of their 5-year-old son
Tuesday night.
   The 42-year-old licensed pilot took to the skies after the
slaying in an aerial shooting spree during which he buzzed the
control tower at Logan four times before landing with just five
minutes' worth of fuel, authorities said.
   ``The fourth time ... the controllers were directed to literally
vacate the tower and relocate to the radar room until further
notice,'' said Michael Ciccarelli, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   No injuries were reported from the shots fired from the plane.
   Trooper Barbara Bennett said authorities decided to track the
two-seat Cessna by radar from the ground and wait for it to run out
of fuel instead of sending a helicopter after it because ``you'd be
a sitting duck in the air.''
   ``There was a high degree of frustration for authorities on the
ground, but it wouldn't have made sense to go up after him,''
Bennett said.
   Hunter's flight took him over the Kenmore Square neighborhood,
where the Boston Red Sox had just finished a game. Police found two
shell casings nearby. He also flew under a bridge over Boston
Harbor and buzzed several other neighborhoods and the post office
where he worked, authorities said.
   ``He kept dive-bombing it there,'' said Richard Serino, a deputy
superintendent of Boston Emergency Medical Services. ``The people
were saying it looked like he was going to crash, then he pulled up
and did a couple of turns.''
   Hunter was captured peacefully when he landed at the airport
shortly after 1 a.m. No weapons were found. Police said they did
not know how many shots were fired from the plane. Two casings and
two live shells were in the aircraft.
   The trouble began in Danvers, 30 miles north of Boston, when
Hunter shot his ex-wife three times at her home with a rifle in
front of their son, Steven, said Danvers police Sgt. Richard
Landers. Trooper Mark Lynch said the couple, divorced two years
ago, had appeared in court Tuesday, but he declined to say why.
   Hunter's wife was believed to be in her mid-30s.
   After the shooting, Hunter fled in his van, tried but failed to
wave a car down with his gun and then stole a car at gunpoint at a
restaurant in Peabody.
   The car owner told police Hunter was carrying an assault rifle.
Lynch said the casings recovered might have come from an AK-47 or
another large-caliber weapon.
   Hunter drove the stolen car to an airport in Beverly, where he
took the plane, Landers said. Robert Golder, a 21-year-old flight
instructor, said Hunter, wielding a rifle, ordered him to start the
plane and leave the cockpit.
   ``He told me not to do anything stupid. He said he had just
killed some people,'' Golder said. He said he headed back to the
airport with his back to the man.
   ``I thought about running. I thought about dropping to the
ground. I just walked calmly,'' he said.
   At one point, 10 rounds were fired at a Continental Airlines jet
that was on the ground at Logan but missed the plane and a mechanic
working underneath, said FAA agent Stacy Grace. Shots ricocheted
off the runway and a building, she said.
   Airports across Massachusetts and in New Hampshire were alerted,
said Trooper Byron Rizos.
   A man showed police a shell casing he said had fallen from the
sky and struck him. One other casing was found nearby. ``There's no
question it's from the plane,'' said Robert Hayden, deputy police
superintendent.
