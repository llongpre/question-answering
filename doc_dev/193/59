   An Eastern Airlines shuttle with one passenger
aboard blew two tires while landing in heavy fog, blocking a runway
that caused Logan International Airport to close to incoming
traffic for two hours.
   There were no injuries reported on the Tuesday shuttle, Flight
138 from Washington's National Airport, said airport spokesman Phil
Orlandella.
   The disabled plane, with two blown tires on its right side,
blocked the runway used for instrument-guided landings during fog
for two hours, but departures were not affected, Orlandella said.
   Reports said the tires blew after an antiskidding mechanism on
the right landing gear locked during the landing, he said.
