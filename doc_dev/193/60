<HEAD>Bottled Dirty Boston Harbor Water Banned In Boston Airport</HEAD>

   Gag bottles of dirty Boston Harbor water haven't
gone over very well with Logan International Airport officials, who
have banned the novelties from airport gift shops.
   ``It reflects badly on other concessions at the airport, like
fresh fish,'' said Massport spokeswoman Teresa McAlpine. ``One
man's gimmick is another man's economic trauma.''
   Irving and Selma Kravetz of Quincy came up with the idea of
selling 5-ounce bottles of polluted Boston Harbor Water. He
collects the filthy stuff in large vats. She helps fill the little
bottles.
   Each bottle bears a label that promises the dirty water inside
is 100 percent proof but not for drinking. As an insurance measure,
the bottle caps are sealed with glue. They sell for $3 or $4.
   But Massport, which runs the airport, couldn't quite swallow the
idea. And since anything sold at the airport needs Massport's
approval, the bottles were ordered off the shelves last week.
   During his failed run for the White House last November, Gov.
Michael Dukakis took a beating from then-Vice President George Bush
for having the country's dirtiest harbor.
   Bush's advertising drowned out Dukakis' claim that he took the
lead in addressing centuries of harbor pollution by setting up the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority in 1984 to clean the harbor
waters.
   Luckily for the Kravetzes, they also bottle Cape Cod water,
which is cleaner, so they simply swapped merchandise, Mrs. Kravetz
said.
   ``I thought they could have at least taken a joke,'' Mrs.
Kravetz said Thursday.
   Said her husband, ``They have no sense of humor.''
