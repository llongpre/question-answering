   Midway Airlines Inc. said Wednesday it made a
$200 million offer for certain assets of Eastern Airlines,
including some Philadelphia-to-Canada routes, terminals and other
properties.
   Midway advised Eastern that it has financing commitments in
place, said Chairman David R. Hinson.
   Any transacion would need approvals from the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court and the U.S. departments of Justice and Transportation.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection and reorganization
shortly after the March 4 strike by its machinists began. The
carrier, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., plans to sell around $1.8
billion of assets and rebuild as a smaller airline.
   Midway said it wants:
   _Eastern's terminals, related equipment and cargo sites at
Philadelphia International Airport.
   _Certain passenger-handling facilties at Boston's Logan
International Airport.
   _Eastern's Philadelphia-Toronto and Philadelphia-Montreal routes.
   _Some Douglas DC9-31 aircraft.
   Midway Airlines and Midway Commuter fly to 51 destinations from
Midway Airport on Chicago's Southwest Side.
