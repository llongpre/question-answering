   Eastern Airlines prepared to more than double its
strike-depleted flight schedule, but union leaders questioned its
ability to expand operations and vowed to extend pickets to sister
carrier Continental Airlines.
   Eastern announced its expansion plans as passengers began
returning to its Northeast Shuttle, lured by bargain fares of $12 a
seat. A federal bankruptcy judge also helped the carrier keep some
planes aloft by authorizing Eastern to pay non-striking employees.
   Meanwhile, lawyers for 8,500 striking Machinists accused the
airline of timing Thursday's bankruptcy filing to avoid paying wages
to union members. Attorney Robert Clayman said he would go to U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York to get an estimated $7.5 million owed
for the past week.
   The crippled carrier said it planned to restore 80 flights a day,
mainly major East Coast and Latin American routes. That would raise
its total number of flights to more than 140 a day _ less than 15
percent of its prestrike schedule.
   ``This is the beginning of a new smaller, restructured and viable
Eastern Airlines,'' Eastern President Phil Bakes said Friday.
   Eastern said it had 200 pilots available at the start of the
week, when it laid off 9,500 workers and drastically reduced
operations. In addition, spokeswoman Cory Zywotow said that ``since
the bankruptcy filing, pilots have been calling in to report back to
work.''
   The pilots' union, which has been honoring the Machinists'
pickets as well as flight attendants, questioned whether the company
could sustain the increased schedule for long without violating
Federal Aviation Administration restrictions on individual flying
time.
   ``They're going to be able to slightly augment the current
schedule, but they're just trying to maximize the available pool of
pilots,'' said J.B. Stokes, a 17-year Eastern pilot and spokesman
for the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Pilots accused Eastern of ``stepping up its campaign to threaten,
coerce and otherwise entice pilots to cross'' the picket line.
   ``This includes illegal offers of bonuses for second officers and
phone calls to pilots' homes, attempting to intimidate spouses, and
even their children, with threats that their breadwinner will never
be able to work again for Eastern,'' said Ron Cole, a pilots' union
spokesman.
   Strikers also contended the crews on the restored flights
beginning Sunday and Monday will be from Continental and vowed to
picket that airline, which like Eastern is owned by Texas Air Corp.
   Machinists' union officer Wally Haber said Eastern has brought
100 pilots and 60 mechanics from Continental to Miami to operate the
restored flights.
   Union members today planned a show of solidarity at labor rallies
in several cities including Miami, Chicago and Buffalo.
   The Machinists began picketing Continental in its home base of
Houston and at Philadelphia International Airport, and more than 300
people rallied Friday in support of the strikers at Continental's
terminal at Newark International Airport in New Jersey.
   ``There's going to be an all-out effort to stop Continental from
operating _ legally,'' said Frank DeMaria, secretary-treasurer of
the Machinists local in Newark.
   Travel agents were wary about booking travelers on Eastern after
thousands of ticket holders were stranded around the nation. Many of
those became unsecured creditors when the company filed for Chapter
11 reorganization and will have to file claims with the bankruptcy
court to get a refund.
   Eastern intends to resume service between Miami and 13 Latin
American cities, and between Boston and Washington, Miami and San
Juan, Puerto Rico, Miami and New York, and New York and Montreal,
Eastern officials said.
   Company officials said they have recalled about 90 non-union
reservations agents to prepare for the expansion, spurred in part by
Friday's offering of a $12 one-way fare on Eastern's shuttle between
Washington, New York and Boston.
   Steve Davis, an Eastern spokesman at Boston's Logan International
Airport, said Boston-New York shuttles flew 90 percent full Friday.
Shuttle flights earlier in the week reportedly carried as few as
seven passengers.
   The $12 fare will go up to $49 Monday, still below normal prices
of $69 to $99 on weekends and $99 on weekdays.
   Before the strike, Eastern was the nation's seventh-largest
carrier with 1,050 flights a day and some 31,200 employees. The work
force has dwindled to 1,500 and losses have grown to some $4 million
daily since the strike began.
   Meanwhile, a judge in New York extended indefinitely an order
barring commuter railroad workers from honoring any picket lines
thrown up by Eastern's machinists. A federal appeals court in
Philadelphia issued a similar ban for that area.
