   A United Airlines jetliner came within 300 feet of
rooftops in a residential neighborhood where two small planes have
crashed in little more than three years, a newspaper reported today.
   The wide-bodied Boeing 767 jet with 184 people on board was
headed for Logan International Airport in bad weather when it flew
about 800 feet lower that it should have over the Dorchester
neighborhood, The Boston Globe reported, citing information from a
flight data recorder.
   The newspaper said an air traffic controller ordered the pilot
to abandon approach during the June 7, 1989 incident. The plane
went around and landed safely.
   Last month, all three people on a twin-engine plane were killed
when it went down Dorchester and set two houses on fire.
   In June 1987, the pilot of a small plane was killed when it
crashed in Dorchester, destroying three homes and injuring three
people on the ground.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said the United pilot made a
bad approach. The FAA suspended the flight certificates of the
pilot and first officer, whose names have not been released, but
waived further penalties because they reported the incident.
