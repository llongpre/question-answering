   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiku Kaifu arrived
Saturday for a weekend visit in Boston, where he planned to meet
with academicians, visit the Museum of Fine Arts and toss out the
first pitch at a Red Sox game.
   Kaifu, on a weeklong tour of the United States, Canada and
Mexico, came straight from Washington, where he met Friday with
President Bush for talks on the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance and other
issues.
   The Prime Minister's trip, coming soon after he ascended to
Japan's top governmental post, is designed in part to lend
legitimacy to his new administration. But his Boston itinerary,
which was to squeeze in visits to Harvard University and the Plimoth
Plantation, where the pilgrims first settled, seemed to resemble
more that of a typical tourist.
   Kaifu, 58, was made prime minister last month after his
predecessors in Japan's ruling conservative party suffered a series
of political and sex scandals.
   Waving American and Japanese flags, about 400 people were on hand
when the Prime Minister arrived at Logan International Airport.
Approximately 300 of the spectators were students at the Japanese
Language School of Greater Boston.
   The principal of the school, Etsuo Takahashi, said he thought it
was important to give the Japanese Prime Minister an appropriate
reception.
   ``We wanted to prove that the Japanese and the United States are
in good and friendly relations. Not only Japanese but Americans are
here too,'' said Takahashi, 48, through an interpreter.
   Kaifu and his wife passed through a reception line at Logan
International Airport that included Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and his
wife Kitty, as well as Cathy Flynn, the Boston Mayor's wife. The
mayor is traveling in California.
   The group then shook hands with the crowd and departed in
limousines for the Four Seasons Hotel in Boston, where Dukakis and
Kaifu were to hold a private meeting.
   After the meeting, the Prime Minister planned to host a dinner
for the area's leading academicians. The presidents of Harvard
University, Boston University, The University of Massachusetts and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were invited, as well as
several scholars in East Asian studies.
   Kaifu, who served as Japan's educational minister twice, was
scheduled to visit MIT and Harvard on Sunday.
   The Prime Minister wanted to emphasize the top priority he gives
to the relationship between the United States and Japan in the
educational sphere, said Richard Winslow, an adviser at the Japanese
Consulate.
   After a quick tour of the Asiatic, Impressionistic and Copley
galleries at the Museum of Fine Arts, Kaifu will head for Fenway
Park to see the Red Sox play the Seattle Mariners.
   Kaifu, who began his trip Aug. 30 in San Francisco, is scheduled
to fly to Mexico City on Monday and go from there to Ottawa, Canada.
