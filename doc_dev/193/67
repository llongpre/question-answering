   A Delta Air Lines jet that nearly collided with a Continental Airlines jet over the Atlantic a week ago departed again from its prescribed flight path as it approached Newfoundland less than two hours later, according to the Canadian Aviation Safety Board. 

   The board said the second incident was detected on radar by Canadian air traffic controllers at Gander, Newfoundland. 
It brought the Delta L-1011 jet within seven miles of a British Airways 747 jet flying a parallel route from London to Toronto. 
International regulations require a minimum separation of 10 miles. 

   The board said the Delta plane, which was flying from London to Cincinnati, corrected its flight path on instructions from air traffic controllers at Gander. 

   David Owen, a board investigator, said two incidents on the same flight suggested a possible equipment problem. 
The case is being investigated by Canada because the incidents occurred in an area of the Atlantic where Gander is responsible for communications and for search and rescue. 

   The board is to receive today from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board transcripts of its interviews with the pilots and crew of the Delta and Continental planes and other aircraft that were in the area when the near-collision occurred. 

   Mr. Owen said he couldn't discuss tape recordings of radio communications that were said to include suggestions that the Continental crew omit any report of the near collision. 
He said Gander received a report of the incident from the Continental crew more than three hours after it happened. 
The Continental 747 was flying to Newark, N.J., from London. 

   Mr. Owen said the Delta jet flew under the Continental plane, coming within 50 feet of it. 
The board is to complete its report of the incidents within 120 days. 

   In Delta's fourth flight mishap since June 30, a flight originating in San Francisco landed on the wrong runway at Boston's Logan International Airport Sunday night, forcing an Eastern Airlines jet that was taxiing to stop short. 

   The Delta spokesman said the carrier is investigating and no action has been taken at this point against the flight crew.
