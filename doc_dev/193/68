   A twin-engine private airplane crashed today in a
driveway between two houses in a crowded residential neighborhood,
killing the president of a major urban development firm and two
other people, officials said.
   The crash, which occurred in fog and light rain, also set the
two houses on fire, but the residents apparently escaped unhurt.
   Killed was Michael Spear, the president of the Rouse Co., a
downtown developer whose projects included the Harbor Place on the
Baltimore waterfront, the Faneuil Hall shopping area in Boston, the
South Street Seaport in New York and the revitalization of
Underground Atlanta.
   Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the agency which runs Logan
International Airport, identified Spear, 49.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials at Logan said the
plane was about 20 miles from the airport when he was asked by the
tower to climb. He then reported having trouble climbing and smoke
coming from an engine.
   The Piper Cheyenne turboprop was then lost from the radar screen
at about 6:30 a.m. Visibility at the time was one-quarter mile,
said Gail Lattrell, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The flight plan indicated there were three people on the plane
and that it was flying from Chatham on Cape Cod, where the Spears
have a home, to Boston and planned to return to Chatham, Lattrell
said.
   Spear, a pilot and an athlete, has been president of the Rouse
Co., the largest publicly held real estate development company in
the nation, since 1986.
   Orlandella said he could not confirm reports that the two other
victims were relatives of Spear, but statements from others
indicated his wife, Judy, and a daughter were killed.
   ``This is a terrible loss to the Rouse Co. and to the country,''
said James W. Rouse, retired founder of the company. ``Mike Spear
was a brilliant, compassionate, wise man. His leadership was
tremendous. In many respects, he is irreplaceable. Judy was a
wonderful woman who made a great contribution in her own right, as
well as to Mike's work.''
   John Stanton, whose son, Michael, was dating 20-year-old Jodi
Spear, said his son had stayed at the Spear home Thursday night and
learned of the deaths when police came to the house in Chatham
today.
   Spear, who lived in Columbia, Md., joined Rouse in 1967 as
director of market research and project evaluation. From 1971 to
1978, he was general manager of the Columbia project. Spear was
named executive vice president for development in 1978.
   Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache said apparently no one on
the ground was hurt in the crash.
   The airport was closed to arrivals for more than an hour after
the crash.
   The fire destroyed two single-family houses on Lorna Road, and
the plane incinerated a car between the houses, setting off a
series of explosions. Neighbors said no one was at home in one
house; residents of the other escaped.
   A resident of one house said he threw his wife and three
children out a first-floor window of their burning home.
   ``I don't know how I got out myself,'' said Suliman Kemokai, 39.
   His wife, Evelyn, was too shaken to speak. Their daughter,
Monique, 17, said she heard the crash and the next thing she knew
the house was on fire and her mother was trying to round up the
children.
   Monique said they tried to get out the back door, but it was
locked and they could not find the key.
