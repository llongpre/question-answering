   A flight carrying 40 passengers was diverted for an
unscheduled landing at Logan International Airport Wednesday after
losing cabin pressurization, apparently due to a faulty valve,
officials said.
   Continental Airlines Flight 269 from Hartford, Conn., to
Cleveland had been airborne for about a half hour when the cabin of
the Boeing 737 aircraft depressurized, said Continental spokesman
Dave Messing in Houston. Passengers were told to use oxygen masks,
and no-one was injured, he said.
   The flight was diverted to Logan, where it landed without
incident at about 5 p.m. and passengers were put on other flights.
   The plane was to be repaired overnight, Messing said.
   ``The mechanics are looking at it. At this point it appears the
depressurization stemmed from a faulty valve in the pressurization
system,'' he said.
