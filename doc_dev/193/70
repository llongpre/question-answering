   A pair of toy pistols grounded three international
flights and hundreds of passengers when officials at Logan
International Airport decided to err on the side of caution.
   Officials halted flights for several hours after a security
agent checking hand luggage and passengers Thursday night spotted
two guns among the bags moving through her X-ray machine.
   When the agent looked up, she thought she saw someone take the
handbag and run into the crowded concourse, Phil Orlandella,
spokesman for the airport, said.
   ``We went into an emergency procedure and sealed off the area,''
Orlandella said. ``Better safe than sorry.''
   A British Airways 747 carrying 356 passengers was backing away
from the gate at about 9:15 p.m. when the pilot was signaled to
return.
   ``We decided we would take the conservative approach,'' said
Denis Campbell, an assistant manager for the airline.
   Campbell said passengers were asked to deplane and undergo a
security check a second time. The check turned up two toy guns in a
cellophane-covered package that a 12-year-old girl had carried onto
the plane in her bag.
   Orlandella said the security agent who spotted the suspicious
items was asked to try to identify the woman she thought had made
off with the bag.
   The agent at one point identified a passenger on the British
Airways flight, but a second security check of the woman and her
traveling companions revealed nothing, he said.
   ``But we decided she could have passed the guns on to somebody
else, so we ran the whole group through again,'' Orlandella said.
``We also checked the whole aircraft from front to back and side to
side.''
   Orlandella said Air France and Swissair also had a jumbo jet
each held back but that all three flights had departed by 11:30 p.m.
