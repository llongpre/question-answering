   Airports in Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles stepped up
security Tuesday following Iran's vows to avenge the deaths of the
290 people in a jetliner shot down by an American warship.
   ``Our police and security people are very much aware of the
situation and and the potential for what could happen with talks of
retaliation,'' said Ron Wilson, spokesman at San Francisco
International Airport.
   ``We're sensitive to the Iranian incident and we've taken
immediate steps to increase our security posture,'' Dale Harris,
superintendent of operations at Los Angeles International Airport,
said Monday.
   Officials at airports in Atlanta, Baltimore, Miami, Oklahoma
City and Dallas-Fort Worth said no changes were made.
   Boston's Logan International Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella
said security was beefed up, but added ``It's stuff that probably
can't be seen.''
   Lynn Tierney, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy, Newark and LaGuardia
airports in the New York metropolitan area, declined comment on
security.
   ``As in all matters involving security at our facilities, we
will not elaborate on specifics. However, the current situation is
being closely monitored with the appropriate authorities.''
   Bill Malone, spokesman for the Philadelphia International
Airport, also declined to comment on security.
   Cynthia-Val Jones, spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of
Aviation, said officials were stressing the need for ``extra
diligence'' but didn't plan to take any new security measures at
O'Hare International Airport.
   ``We're not adding any additional people. What we have done is
as different shifts come on we make sure that all our security
personnel are alert and aware of the threats and do their jobs with
extra diligence,'' she said Tuesday. ``They're keeping an eye out
for anything that might look suspicious.''
   Wilson said travelers in San Francisco might detect longer waits
at baggage-security points before boarding planes.
   ``More luggage will be opened and visually checked,'' Wilson
said. ``If there's anything that has the slightest question through
the X-ray machine, that person will be asked to open the bag and
let the monitor check it.''
   Airport police and security guards have been told to be extra
observant. But the number of security guards was not increased.
   No threats have been directed toward the airport, he said.
   Harris refused to reveal the extra precautions taken at Los
Angeles other than to say more personnel were on duty.
   ``We have increased our deployment and increased security
awareness or alertness,'' airport police Sgt. Karen Schultz said.
   Iran's ambassador to West Germany said Tuesday that retaliation
will not occur on U.S. soil for the downing of the Iran Air flight.
The 290 passengers and crew are presumed dead.
   Customs and border officials in Texas said they had not
tightened security because of Iran's threat.
   ``I do not know of any actions that have been taken because of
the plane being shot down,'' said Charles Conroy, Customs spokesman
in Houston.
   Doug Mosier, spokesman for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector,
said: ``To my knowledge, there's been no message relayed as to a
specific alert to be on the lookout for Iranian terrorists.''
