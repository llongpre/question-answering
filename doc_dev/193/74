   A man armed with an assault rifle commandeered a
small plane late Tuesday and fired shots from the low-flying
aircraft into downtown Boston after killing his estranged wife,
authorities said.
   The man was captured at about 1:15 a.m. Wednesday when,
apparently running out of fuel, he landed the Cessna at Logan
International Airport, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported from the shots fired from the plane.
   At one point, the man, a licensed pilot, flew over the Boston
Postal Annex, where he works, said State Trooper Paul Perry,
   The man fled Danvers, about 30 miles north of Boston, after his
estranged wife was shot three times with an automatic rifle, stole
a car at gunpoint, commandeered the plane from an employee at the
Beverly Municipal Airport and took off sometime before 10:30 p.m.,
said Danvers police Sgt. Richard Landers.
   Landers said police were called to a Danvers home for a domestic
disturbance around 9:45 p.m., and found the body of the suspect's
estranged wife. Neither the suspect nor his wife have been
identified.
   Witnesses reported hearing shots and seeing the suspect flee in
a van.
   The suspect drove to nearby Peabody, where he stole a car at
gunpoint, said state Tropper Byron Rizos. The car owners told
police the suspect was carrying some type of assault rifle, the
trooper said.
   The suspect used the second car to drive to the Beverly airport,
where he stole the plane, Rizos said.
