   A United Airlines flight with 83 people
on board made an emergency landing Sunday after the plane lost
cabin pressure en route from Chicago to Spokane, Wash., officials
said.
   There were no serious injuries, but 16 people were taken to two
hospitals for treatment of earaches and nausea. All were treated
and released.
   The traffic control tower at Billings Logan International
Airport said it received the pilot's call for medical help just
before 2:30 p.m. and sent out a request for all available
assistance.
   A dozen fire trucks and ambulances were on hand when the Boeing
737-300 made a safe landing and taxied to a stop just east of the
terminal.
   United Flight 793 had 78 passengers, three flight attendants, a
pilot and co-pilot, said Ray Anderson, the airline's Billings
manager.
   The plane was at an altitude of about 37,000 feet and flying
over Miles City, 146 miles east of Billings, when lost some if its
pressure, said Tom Binford, assistant director of aviation here.
   Anderson said pressure stabilized on the plane when it reached
an altitude of 19,000 feet.
   It already had been a bumpy flight from Chicago, said passenger
Mary Burnham of Newtown, Conn., who was flying with her husband and
two children to visit friends in Missoula.
   ``Everybody knew something was wrong,'' Burnham said after the
landing. ``You could feel it in your ears. They wanted to land in
Miles City, but there wasn't enough runway.''
