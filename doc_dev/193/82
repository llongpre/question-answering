   Continental Airlines has moved swiftly to capture
some of the business abandoned by strikebound sister carrier
Eastern Airlines, but it disputes union claims that its moves are
part of a master plan to grow at Eastern's expense.
   Amid its own labor problems _ flight attendants on Friday ended
a four-day walkout that had little impact on service _ Continental
has added flights on routes vacated by Eastern, taken over Eastern
gates at some airports and waged an aggressive ad campaign to
attract more East Coast passengers.
   Industry observers say the Houston-based airline has gained
passengers and revenue, but no more so than other competitors since
Eastern virtually shut down after the March 4 strike by its
Machinists union and subsequent walkouts by pilots and flight
attendants.
   ``Every carrier that still flies will be doing better now than
they were before the strike, with the exception of some of the
commuter lines who may have been feeding into Eastern flights,''
said George James, president of Airline Economics Inc. in
Washington D.C.
   ``So Continental will certainly see benefits, but I think that
there are a number of carriers who will have far greater benefits
than Continental,'' James said.
   Eastern is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy court
protection from creditors.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York extended an
order Friday forcing rival airlines to honor agreements governing
ticket, baggage and cargo transfers essential to keeping
strike-crippled Eastern Airlines airborne. He also barred the
striking Machinists from picketing on Eastern property at Logan
International Airport in Boston.
   Separately, a federal appeals court in Miami told a lower court
to reconsider the airline's request that it force Eastern pilots
back to work.
   Eastern's unions have claimed that the parent of the two
airlines, Texas Air Corp., has been trying to funnel Eastern assets
to Continental, a largely non-union carrier. The Machinists and Air
Line Pilots Association have asked the federal bankruptcy court to
appoint a trustee to govern Eastern's daily operations and business
transactions, removing company management from that role.
   The unions also allege that Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo is
using Continental as a profit-generating tool against the striking
workers.
   But Continental officials say they _ like other airlines _
simply are responding to consumer demand created by the strike.
   Continental has added eight flights out of its Newark hub, nine
additional flights on Miami routes abandoned by Eastern and a new
Cleveland-Miami route.
   The carrier also took over eight Eastern landing slots at New
York's LaGuardia Airport and eight at Washington's National
Airport, under what Continental describes as a 60-day lease.
   ``These added flights are simply to help us address demand in
the marketplace, and this really is no different from what other
carriers out there are doing,'' said Continental spokesman Ned
Walker.
   Charles Bryan, president of Eastern's Machinists union, said
Lorenzo is ``using Continental like a war machine'' to offset the
Eastern strike, increasing revenues and expanding Continental
permanently into Eastern's markets.
   Robert Joedicke, an airline analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in New York, said Continental's ability to offset Eastern's
losses for Texas Air was limited.
   ``There are some short-term advantages to Continental as they
pick up some additional flights and passengers, just as there are
to other airlines,'' Joedicke said.
   ``But the advantage through Continental from a Texas Air point
of view will come nowhere near making up for what is being lost at
Eastern as a result of the strike and the bankruptcy filing.''
   Eastern is averaging just over 100 flights daily, compared with
1,040 daily before the strike.
   Continental officials had no available figures on profits since
the Eastern strike began.
   ``When they release their March traffic results we'll be able to
make some judgments,'' said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst for
Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.
   Other analysts said that while there are some clear winners in
the Eastern strike, Continental appears to be a lesser player.
   ``Some are obviously seeing benefits, not the least of which is
Delta Air Lines' operations in Atlanta,'' James said.
   ``Delta and Eastern have had about 90 percent of the market
there with Delta holding about 55 or 60 percent, so with Eastern
down, Delta does not face a large amount of competition,'' he said.
   Also, James said, Pan Am has doubled its operations on the
lucrative New York-Washington-Boston shuttle during peak periods.
United Airlines, Trans World Airlines and USAir have capitalized on
flights between the Midwest and the East Coast.
