   A man charged with killing his ex-wife with an
assault rifle then going on a three-hour aerial rampage _ buzzing
buildings and firing at cars _ had been placed on probation just
hours before the shooting.
   Alfred J. Hunter, 42, had been convicted Tuesday of assault and
battery and of violating a protective order stemming from a New
Year's Eve fight with his wife over which television station to
watch.
   She had first asked for a restraining order in January 1988. The
couple's six-year marriage ended in divorce four months later.
   Salem District Court Judge John T. Doyle placed Hunter on one
year's probation.
   The trouble began later that evening when police in Danvers,
about 20 miles north of Boston, responded to a domestic dispute
call. They found the body of Elvira Hunter, 30, in her apartment,
shot several times with an AK-47 assault rifle, state Trooper Mark
Lynch said.
   Lynch said the couple's 5-year-old son saw his father kill his
mother.
   Hunter fled, stole a car from a restaurant in nearby Peabody and
then commandeered a Cessna airplane, which he flew helter-skelter
over a 60-mile area of Greater Boston, dive-bombing buildings and
firing the automatic rifle, police said.
   He was captured when he landed at Logan International Airport
early Wednesday, was charged with murder and armed robbery and
ordered held without bail for 20 days' psychiatric observation.
   Before the assault and battery conviction, Hunter had pleaded
guilty in 1979 to assaulting a group of people with a machete and
was sentenced to one year's probation. Hunter told police the group
had tried to rob him.
   The machete incident did not show up in the probation papers
given to the judge before Tuesday's sentencing, Essex County
District Attorney Kevin Burke said.
   ``I'm not sure that the outcome would have been any different,''
Burke said.
   A court-appointed pychiatrist, Dr. David Swenson, said Hunter
told him during an examination Wednesday that he had been treated
for psychiatric problems at a Veteran's Administration Hospital and
was taking a minor tranquilizer, Lorazepam, for anxiety. Hunter
served in Vietnam.
   Police today were piecing together Hunter's flight from hundreds
of witnesses' reports.
   Stockbroker Andrew Smith was walking to a tavern when he heard
popping noises from the sky and spotted a low-flying plane.
   ``About two seconds later, several shell casings landed all
around. At that point I realized that the guy was shooting out of
his plane,'' Smith said.
   During the flight, Hunter dipped under a bridge, veered within
50 feet of motorists and buildings and fired at targets including
parked cars and the Prudential tower's 50th floor skywalk.
   Police in Boston received more than 200 calls about shots being
fired. In suburban Lynn, police said two cars were hit in a shower
of gunfire believed to have come from the plane.
   Logan air traffic controllers twice evacuated the tower. They
said Hunter buzzed them repeatedly, forcing officials to close the
airport for an hour and reroute late-night flights.
   ``We have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic
control, but there's nothing in there about what to do if a maniac
comes shooting an AK-47 at you in the control tower,'' said John
Leyden, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Washington.
