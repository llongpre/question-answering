   Washington National landed on top in a study of
passenger convenience and amenities at the nation's 20 busiest
airports, Money magazine said in its May issue.
   Washington got high marks for being easy to reach _ only four
miles from downtown _ and for the nation's third best on-time
record. Next are Phoenix Sky Harbor International and Boston's
Logan International, both close to downtown and ranked high on
amenities.
   John F. Kennedy International and Newark International, both
serving New York City, rated last. Both are low on amenities and
costly to reach from the city _ $22 or $28 by taxi, Money said.
   ``Airports have as much, if not more, to do with the quality of
air travel as the airlines they serve,'' said Money, which studied
federal flight-delay data and sent a team of reporters to airports.
   In separate listings, Money also picked the best and worst
airports overall. They included:
   _Washington National, best airport to fly to; Dallas-Fort Worth
International, the worst.
   _Phoenix's Sky Harbor, best airport ``to get stuck at'' because
of its amenities and ``distinct Southwest flavor''; Atlanta, the
worst.
