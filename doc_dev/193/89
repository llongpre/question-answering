   A landing Eastern Airlines jet tore the top off a
twin-engine plane that touched down just before it, killing one
person aboard the smaller aircraft, officials said.
   None of the 149 people on the jet was injured in the accident on
a runway at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport at 7:15 p.m.
Thursday, an Eastern spokesman said. The spokesman said a wing was
damaged on the jet, a Boeing 727.
   The collision involved Eastern Flight 111, which originated in
Montreal and stopped in New York, and a twin-engine Beechcraft King
Air 100 flying from a suburban airport. A second person aboard the
Beechcraft was injured.
   Both planes had been cleared to land, Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Jack Barker said.
   Asked if that indicated a problem in the control tower, he
replied, ``That's under investigation.''
   ``Obviously something went wrong for two airplanes to hit each
other on the runway,'' Barker said. ``Everything involving the
movement of those two aircraft will be considered'' by federal
investigators.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators from
Washington arrived today. Spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said they
would question witnesses, including the Eastern crew and the
smaller plane's injured co-pilot, and would examine air traffic
control tapes and Eastern's operating procedures.
   Under aircraft approach rules, ``the arriving aircraft cannot be
cleared to land until the preceding aircraft has left the runway,''
Ms. Andersen said. ``We won't speculate as to what this might mean.
I can't tell you what the cause is.''
   Roger Myers, another FAA spokesman, said the Eastern plane was
completing its landing as the Beechcraft still was taxiing on the
runway.
   ``The Eastern airliner landed behind him, and they collided on
the runway,'' Myers said. ``He (The Eastern pilot) was on his
landing roll,'' meaning the jet was still rolling to a stop.
   Barker said officials did not know how much time lapsed between
the two plane landings, although ``It was very close between the
two.''
   It isn't unusual for planes to land within two minutes of each
other at Hartsfield, which was the world's busiest airport in 1987
and ranked third last year, according to FAA figures. The airport
averaged 75 landings an hour on two runways in 1987, an airport
spokesman said then.
   It was the first pilot death at Hartsfield since three Delta Air
Lines crew members were killed in a 1958 accident, said Hartsfield
spokeswoman Rhonda Copenny. She said the huge airport has never had
a passenger fatality.
   Gene Griffin, an Eastern passenger from New York, said, ``The
plane veered to the left and hit something. I thought maybe it was
a pothole. No one was really sure what was going on, but no one was
really hurt or shaken up.''
   Those who witnessed the collision described it much differently.
   ``I seen this debris flying everywhere, terrible, just like it
flipped over and it was way up in the air _ terrible,'' said Rodney
Johnson, an airport ground worker.
   Airport spokesman John Braden said the jet coasted 2,000 feet
before stopping.
   The runway where the crash occurred was closed until National
Transportation Safety Board investigators would let airport workers
move the wreckage, probably sometime today, Braden said. Operations
continued normally on the other runways.
   There was a little rain and fog at the time of the collision,
but ``it was not bad weather,'' Braden said. He said he had not
talked to controllers in the tower about what might have happened.
   The Beechcraft was owned by Epps Air Service and based at DeKalb
Peachtree Airport on the edge of Atlanta. The two men aboard the
plane were Epps employees, Braden said.
   ``The top half of the plane was pretty well sheared off. ... The
engines are intact,'' Braden said. The tail section also was
missing.
   Killed was Eric Thomas, 30, of Acworth, Ga., and injured was
Daniel Olthoff, 26, of Norcross, Ga., said officials at the
hospital where both were taken. Olthoff was described as
``conscious, alert and talking.''
   ``Passengers on the Eastern flight are OK. No injuries,'' said
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami.
   Matell said the flight was carrying 141 passengers and a crew of
eight; Atlanta was its final destination. Matell said the Eastern
plane's captain, whose name was not released, had 23 years'
experience with the company.
