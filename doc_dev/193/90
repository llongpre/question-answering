   On the 80th day of the Eastern Airlines strike,
picketing machinists, flight attendants and pilots at Logan
International Airport shared a picnic lunch brought by a fellow
striker.
   That kind of camaraderie, many Eastern employees say, has
boosted their spirits and determination as the bitter strike nears
the start of its fourth month.
   ``It's not easy but we're doing the best we can,'' Eastern ramp
service worker Bob Austin, 43, said Monday as he walked one of five
picket lines that operate daily at Logan.
   ``I'm not spending much. I haven't been to a store in two
months,'' Austin said. ``But I'm optimistic. I just hope the
airline will be sold in one piece.''
   Added 52-year-old pilot Ray Chumsae: ``I'm living on rainy day
money and so far there's been a lot of rainy days.''
   The local Machinists union has established a food and job bank
that many strikers have used to procure part-time work that allows
them to picket at least three times a week.
   ``We're still very solid and upbeat,'' said William Conley,
chief steward of the local Machinists. ``It helps to get all the
support. Our hope is to keep Eastern together.''
   Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from creditors
since March 9, five days after the start of the paralyzing strike
by Machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight
attendants.
   A federal bankruptcy judge in New York must approve a sale of
Eastern or any of its assets.
   ``This airline is not going to be sold in one piece, that's been
said over and over again,'' Eastern spokesman Steve Davis said.
``But for the strikers, it's a terrible situation. There's a
terrible human price being paid. We think it's awful.''
   About half of Eastern's 2,000 employees at Logan have joined the
walkout. On average, about 40 striking workers walk four-hour
shifts before being replaced by fresh pickets.
   The strikers exchange jokes as well as problems as they walk the
picket lines, which they have given nicknames.
   ``We talk about what's going on and all the things that crop up
because of this,'' said baggage handler Tom Hogan, 57. ``It's kind
of like a support group.''
   On Monday, strikers dined on pita bread sandwiches, potato chips
and soda on a blue-checked tablecloth spread on a grass island
adjacent to the Eastern terminal. They call the area ``Hollywood''
because it is the picket line of choice for television news camera
crews.
   ``There's a camaraderie about the whole issue,'' said B.J.
Phillips, 42, an Eastern flight attendant for 23 years who said she
was picketing at 6 a.m. on the strike's first day. ``People have
really pitched in for each other.''
   Phillips, who brought the picnic hamper, said some of the food
was donated by friends in her hometown of Carlisle.
   But despite the optimism, most of the strikers expressed anger
and frustration, much of toward Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas
Air Corp., Eastern's parent company.
   ``Most of us here love our jobs but there's something terribly
wrong with the company,'' said 57-year-old pilot Bill Johansen, a
24-year Eastern veteran. People here have stuck together but
sometimes I'm amazed we've hung on.''
