   A Continental DC-9 skidded to an emergency
landing Tuesday night at Newark International Airport after a
hydraulic failure, but none of the 89 people aboard was injured,
officials said.
   In another incident Tuesday, a United Airlines pilot who thought
his jet had lost its hydraulic system switched to a backup system
and diverted the plane to a landing at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
   Flight 354 from Chicago to Newark made the emergency landing
shortly after 8 p.m., said Vincent Bonaventura, the general manager
of the airport.
   Continental spokesman Ned Walker said in a telephone interview
from Houston that the plane appeared to have suffered a loss of one
of its hydraulic systems, and a partial loss of the other.
   The plane blew four of its six tires upon landing, Walker said.
Lynn Tierney, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, said the plane dumped an undetermined amount of fuel
before landing to reduce the possibility of a fire.
   ``The captain had full control of the aircraft at all times,
full control of the landing gear and flaps,'' Walker said. He said
that on a DC-9, the operation of certain controls is improved by
the hydraulics systems, but they continue working if the hydraulics
are lost.
   He said the tires blew out because the captain, following
established procedures, turned off the anti-skid system which is
designed to prevent the wheels from locking up.
   The plane ended up perpendicular to the runway after using about
three-quarters of the runway, Port Authority officials said.
   The flight's 82 passengers, who were told to brace themselves
for the emergency landing, went down an emergency ladder from the
plane along with the seven crew members.
   Passengers said they were shaken by the accident after last
week's United crash in Iowa.
   ``I realized I didn't want to die this way,'' passenger Trent
Webb said. ``You think about the crash before.''
   Sgt. Anthony Infante, who works on the Port Authority's rescue
squad, said there have been 320 hydraulic alerts this year at
Newark. But he said that inlcudes everything from a stuck light to
something as serious as Tuesday's incident.
   In the second incident, United Flight 275, en route from Chicago
to Houston's Hobby Airport, made its landing at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport late Tuesday afternoon, the airline said.
   ``It was not an emergency landing, it was a precautionary
landing,'' said United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker.
   The Boeing 737 was carrying 64 passengers, two pilots and three
flight attendants. None was injured, she said.
   The pilot suspected the jet had a hydraulic problem when a
warning light flashed on.
   ``The aircraft was checked out and the mechanics found no
problem with it,'' Ms. Dornacker said. The flight resumed at 5:30
p.m. and landed in Houston at a little more than an hour later.
   A complete hydraulic failure forced the emergency landing last
Wednesday of United Flight 232 at Sioux City, Iowa. The DC-10
somersaulted, broke apart and burst into flames, killing 111 people.
   An engine apparently blew itself apart on Flight 232 and severed
all three hydraulic systems, depriving the pilot of controls other
than the throttles.
