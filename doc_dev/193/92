   Opponents of a plan to replace the nation's fifth
busiest airport are pulling out all the stops with just one week
before voters decide the issue.
   A Rocky Mountain News poll published Sunday showed support to
replace Stapleton International Airport remains 2-to-1 among Denver
voters.
   Business owners who would suffer economically if Denver's
airport is moved have formed a group called Save Our Stapleton and
have hired high-priced political consultant Roger Ailes.
   Ailes' television ads for George Bush in last fall's
presidential election made Michael Dukakis look unsoldierly while
riding in a tank. His first ad for the Save Our Stapleton group
depicted Mayor Federico Pena looking awkward in a construction hard
hat as an unseen announcer warns that ``developers'' and
``politicians'' are trying to sell Denver a bad project.
   Denver wants to build the first major new airport in the United
States since 1974, when the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport
was built.
   Stapleton was built in 1929 in northeast Denver.
   ``It's patchwork and glue, baling wire and chewing gum,''
Stapleton spokesman Richard Boulware said. ``Everything has been
added on since. We even have some of the original control tower
from 1929 in the sub-basement.''
   Opponents say a new airport is unneeded. They cite figures
showing passenger traffic at Stapleton has declined during the past
two years and say Stapleton can be expanded.
   The airport has become more than just a local and statewide
issue.
   The Federal Aviation Administration would like to see new
airports built in New York, Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles.
   New airports have become so expensive that aviation analysts
predict only one or two will be built before the end of the
century. Cost estimates of the new Denver airport range from $1.7
billion to $2.3 billion.
   Where the money ultimately would come from to build an airport
has been at the heart of debate.
   A federal judge ruled Monday that Denver may not increase
landing fees or use airline money to pay for the proposed new
airport, but said the city could use concessions fees.
   The two main airlines at Stapleton, United and Continental,
responded to the ruling by saying the city should refund at least
$8 million paid toward the proposed new airport between 1985 and
1986.
   Concessions funds amount to about $30 million a year. Officials
estimate increased landing fees would have brought in an additional
$10 million annually.
   ``People all over the country are looking at Denver to see what
will happen,'' said Bill Kenyon, a spokesman for a pro-airport
group's Let's Vote Yes campaign.
   ``The ad the opposition has put on the air is offensive to this
community,'' said John Frew, who is directing campaign. ``They have
lobbed a sizable hand grenade at us.''
   He said Stapleton has gotten a bad reputation for delays and has
limited capacity to expand.
   Several years ago, Western Airlines, whose hub is in Salt Lake
City, ran an advertising campaign that said, ``Fly with us and
never fly through Stapleton again.''
   Even opponents acknowledge some of the remarks are justified.
   Stapleton has limited capacity to handle jumbo jets. Those
planes are put into what pilots call the ``penalty box'' while
waiting for an access ramp, and delays can last from 20 minutes to
an hour.
   When it snows, the number of operating runways sometimes is cut
from four to one, snarling air traffic across the United States.
   The new airport would be located 17 miles from Stapleton, on the
northeast edge of metropolitan Denver and east of the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal.
   Last year, voters in neighboring Adams County worried that
Denver was trying to ram the project through by annexing their land.
   However, when the issue of whether Denver should be allowed to
annex the land went to a vote, it passed, 55 percent to 45 percent.
