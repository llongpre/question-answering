<LEADPARA>  An air traffic controller allowed a small commuter plane to enter a Los
Angeles International Airport runway Friday night just minutes before telling
a USAir jetliner it was cleared to land on the same runway, federal
investigators said Saturday.;    The controller was juggling several flights,
including an Aeromexico airliner with which she was having difficult
communications, National Transportation Safety Board officials said after
reviewing tape-recorded conversations between the control tower and the plane.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Shortly after the USAir Flight 1493 from Columbus, Ohio, was cleared for
landing, there was an electronic squeal on the tape, and seconds later an
unidentified male voice exclaimed, "What the hell," said Jim Burnett, an NTSB
member.;    Next on the tape came notification of an accident. Officials said
the USAir Boeing 737 struck the smaller Skywest commuter plane from behind,
crushing the aircraft's nose into the pavement of Runway 24L.;    The name of
the controller was not released. Burnett said officials had not been in
contact with her.;    Though six bodies had been recovered from the crash
scene by late Saturday, 20 people remain unaccounted for and are presumed
dead. All 12 people aboard the Skywest twin-engine commuter flight were
believed killed, officials said. The USAir jetliner's captain also died in the
crash.;    The jetliner was carrying 83 passengers and 6 crew members. As many
as 21 people on that flight could have perished, though only one body -- the
captain's -- has been recovered.;    Burnett, at an NTSB press conference near
Los Angeles Airport on Saturday night, said that the smaller plane did not
have its takeoff lights on when it entered runway 24L, but he added that this
is in compliance with federal aviation regulations, which require that takeoff
and anti-collision lights be turned on as it takes off.;    He said
investigators are going to run tests to determine what such a plane would look
like from the control tower and from an approaching aircraft.;    Burnett said
investigators also will study whether a sophisticated radar system was
operating at the time of the accident.;    Meanwhile, the search for bodies
Saturday was hampered by leaking jet fuel and the USAir jetliner's fragile
fuselage, which had split open from the crash.;    "Our crew has returned from
the scene," said a coroner's investigator, Carlos Perez. "It's not safe to
work in there until the fuel's gone and the plane's secure.";    Directly
beneath the 737 airliner was the rubble of the smaller plane, bound for
Palmdale. Said one National Transportation Safety Board official: "It's just
mangled.";    At a morning news briefing, safety board member Burnett would
only confirm that the two planes collided on runway 24L, a landing strip on
the north side of the airport where the USAir Boeing 737 was arriving.;   
Flight recorders recovered;  The Boeing's cockpit and flight data recorders
were recovered before sunrise Saturday by searchers. Both recorders were in
"fine condition," he said.;    The recorders were sent to NTSB labs in
Washington to be analyzed.;    The commuter plane apparently was not equipped
with a voice recorder. The Federal Aviation Administration has given commuter
airlines -- those with planes that carry 10 or more passengers and have two
pilots -- a deadline in October to install voice recorders.;    "There is a
lot of aircraft left to be re-equipped by that date," Burnett said, "and it's
going to press the industry, I think.";    Burnett said the NTSB has asked
that the L.A. control tower supervisor and any of the five controllers on duty
who had handled either aircraft present blood and urine samples for toxicology
tests.;    The FAA requires that the controllers and supervisor in the tower
Friday night present urine samples. But Burnett said that while the supervisor
had agreed to the additional test, one controller, not the one on the tape,
had refused.;    The other controllers apparently had not been approached, he
said.;    Burnett added that after a collision between an aircraft and a truck
in 1989, Skywest had sent a letter to its pilots suggesting that they use
non-collision lights while taxiing -- but leaving the decision to the pilot's
discretion.;    Crash crushed smaller plane;  Earlier in the day, federal
investigators had no immediate explanation for why both planes were on the
runway at the same time Friday night.;    The jet had barely touched down when
it crushed the Skywest commuter plane under its belly as the smaller plane
prepared for takeoff. It skidded about 250 yards down the runway and veered
across a gravel median, a taxiway and a service road before crashing in flames
into an abandoned concrete-block fire station.;    The larger plane dragged
the smaller one all the way.;    "The USAir airplane is sitting right on top
of our airplane and it's smashed flat, and there was a ball of fire that went
through our airplane," Skywest spokeswoman Kristan Norton said. "There are no
survivors.";    Skywest Flight 5569 originated in Palm Springs and was
preparing to take off for suburban Palmdale.;    Skywest pilots identified;
Norton identified two of the dead as Skywest pilot Andrew Lucas, 32, and
co-pilot Frank Charles Prentice III, 45, both of San Luis Obispo. Both were
experienced pilots, with more than 8,000 flight hours each, she said.;   
Among the dead was Mike Fuller, 30, of Palmdale, who was the manager of
Skywest's Palmdale office, Norton said.; COUNTDOWN TO COLLISION; Here is a
chronology of events leading up to collision on Los Angeles Airport runway:;
(box)6:03:37 -- Skywest Flight 5569 tells local controller that it is at
taxiway 45 for departure.; (box)6:03:40 -- Local controller tells Skywest to
hold short of runway 24L.; (box)6:03:45 -- USAir Flight 1493 radios it is
approaching the airport. There is no local controller acknowledgment.;
(box)6:04:44 -- Local controller tells Skywest it can take the position on the
runway and to hold pending traffic that's crossing downfield.; (box)6:04:48 --
Skywest answers it has taken the position and is holding.; (box)6:05:29 --
USAir 1493 seeks clearance to land on runway 24L. There is no local controller
acknowledgment.; (box)6:05:52 -- USAir again asks to land.; (box)6:05:56 --
Clearance to land is received from local controller for flight 1493.;
(box)6:06:56 to 6:07 -- There is an unidentified electronic squeal.(*);
(box)6:07:04 -- An unknown male voice exclaims: "What the hell?"; Local
controller says an accident has been observed.; (*)Investigators believe this
time could be wrong.; Source: National Transportation Safety Board  </TEXT>
