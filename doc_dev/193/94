   An Eastern Airlines jet landing here sheared off
the top of a twin-engine aircraft that touched down just before it
Thursday evening, killing one person and injuring another aboard
the smaller plane, officials said.
   The 7:10 p.m. collision between the Eastern Boeing 727 and a
Beechcraft King Air 100 occurred on a runway at Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport, officials said. No one was injured aboard
the jetliner, said airport spokesman John Braden.
   The two male victims were taken to South Fulton Medical Center;
one was dead on arrival and the other was listed in stable
condition, hospital officials said. There were no reports of other
injuries.
   The collision involved Eastern Flight 111, which originated in
Montreal, and a twin-propeller plane flying from DeKalb Peachtree
Airport on the edge of Atlanta to Hartsfield, about 15 miles south,
said officials with the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``Passengers on the Eastern flight are OK. No injuries,'' said
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami. ``The extent of damage on
our plane is wing damage. How extensive, I don't know.'' The jet
carried 141 passengers and a crew of eight, he said.
   Roger Myers, an FAA spokesman in Atlanta, said the Eastern plane
was completing its landing as the Beechcraft was still taxiing on
the runway.
   ``The Eastern airliner landed behind him, and they collided on
the runway. ... He (the Eastern pilot) was on his landing roll,''
meaning the jet was still rolling to a stop, Myers said.
   Jack Barker, another FAA spokesman, said both planes had been
given permission to land. When asked if that indicated a problem in
the control tower, he replied, ``That's under investigation.''
   Airport spokesman Braden, asked to comment, said, ``I don't
know. I haven't talked to them (the control tower).''
   Officials did not know yet how much time had lapsed between the
two landings, Barker said, although ``it was very close between the
two.''
   Myers said no fire was reported and he did not know whether
either plane might have landed improperly, causing the collision.
   Matell said an earlier report that the smaller plane had crossed
the 727's path was incorrect. ``Both planes were cleared to land,''
Matell said.
   ``It happened so fast. It was like the plane hit something and
sort of scooted to the side,'' said Eastern passenger Mike
Whittaker. ``We thought at first either he hit something or he blew
a tire. A friend of mine was looking out and he said, `I believe we
hit something, it looked like a little airplane.'''
   ``I seen this debris flying everywhere, terrible, just like it
flipped over and it was way up in the air _ terrible,'' said Rodney
Johnson, an airport ground worker who witnessed the collision.
   Braden said the twin-engine aircraft, which carried no other
passengers, belonged to Epps Air Service and was based at
DeKalb-Peachtree Airport. He said both men aboard the plane were
Epps employees.
   ``The top half of the (twin-engine) plane was pretty well
sheared off. ... The engines are intact,'' Braden said. The tail
section also was missing.
   The dead man was identified as Eric Thomas, 30, of Ackworth,
hospital officials said. Injured was Daniel Olthoff, 26, of
Norcross, who was described as ``conscious, alert and talking,''
but doctors were still examining the extent of his injuries.
   FAA officials were on the scene.
   Matell said the Eastern flight originated in Montreal, stopped
in La Guardia, and Atlanta was its final destination.
   The captain is a 23-year Eastern veteran, said Matell, who would
not release his name.
   There was initial confusion about reports of a hydraulic problem
aboard the smaller aircraft. Matell, however, said a pilot flying
another Eastern plane, landing about the same time as Flight 111,
declared an emergency while the pilot was lowering the plane's
landing gear because he thought its hydraulic system had failed.
   He said the problem on Eastern Flight 56, a Boeing 727 flying
from Miami to Orlando to Atlanta, turned out to be a faulty
indicator gauge that mistakenly signaled hydraulic failure.
