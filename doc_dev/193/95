   Flames were spotted Monday in an engine of a TWA
jetliner carrying 176 people, forcing the pilot to abort takeoff.
Seven passengers sustained minor injuries while sliding down
evacuation chutes, officials said.
   The Logan International control tower alerted the crew of Flight
31 less than a minute into the 9:30 a.m. takeoff for St. Louis and
Los Angeles, said Thomas J. Kinton, deputy director of aviation
with the Massachusetts Port Authority.
   The L-1011 jetliner taxied off the runway and chutes were
deployed to help the 163 passengers get off the plane, said Phil
Orlandella, an agency spokesman.
   The injured were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital for
treatment of floor burns and twisted ankles.
   He said ground crews found no smoke or fire when they inspected
the engine.
