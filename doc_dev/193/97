   Wind gusts damaged a passenger jet and a cargo
building at Logan International Airport this morning, forcing at
least one flight to be canceled and a terminal gateway to be
closed.
   No injuries were reported.
   An unoccupied USAir 737-200 was pushed against a jetway in the
incident, which occurred at about 4 a.m., said airline spokeswoman
Susan Young.
   The leading edge of a wing was damaged, forcing USAir to take it
out of service for at least a day and cancel an early-morning
flight to Charlotte, N.C. The jetway, at Gate 8 of the terminal
building, also was damaged and the gate was shut down, Young said.
   The airport authority said there was also damage to the roof of
a freight and cargo building owned by the Hill Management Co.
Company officials were inspecting the building, which is near the
airport's Hilton Hotel, and were not available for comment.
   The wind cracked a window at the National Car Rental car-return
building, and three cars had broken windshields, said John Grasso,
a National spokesman. He estimated the damage at about $700.
   The National Weather Service reported wind gusts of 50 mph in
the area at the time.
