Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' joke about a bomb on a USAir plane and a White House 
aide could have landed the 1988 Democratic presidential candidate in trouble 
with airport security. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis was boarding a USAir flight from Logan International Airport to 
Washington on Sunday evening when he spotted White House aide and political foe 
Ron Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
According to WBZ-TV in Boston, Dukakis reportedly joked about checking Kaufman 
and his baggage for a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Such remarks about airline safety, even in jest, are prohibited by federal law 
and should be reported to authorities, a Federal Aviation Administration 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He apparently made some comment that caused the USAir agent to check with his 
supervisor to see if security should be notified," said USAir spokesman Dave 
Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
Shipley said the supervisor recognized the governor and let him go. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an error in judgment," Shipley said. "He should have been detained 
and questioned if in fact he made some remark" about carrying a bomb.
