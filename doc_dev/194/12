   Police arrested 10 Spanish Basque
militants, including Jose Antonio Urutigoechea, considered by Madrid
to be a top leader of the Spanish Basque separatist organization
ETA, authorities said today.
   Spanish officials, party leaders, and newspapers applauded the
arrest of Urutigoechea, 38, also known as ``Josu Ternera.''
   Spain's leading daily, El Pais, said the arrest means ``ETA has
lost its staunchest, longest-active leader, suffering the toughest
blow.''
   ETA has carried out a 20-year campaign of violence in a bid to
secure independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Spanish Basque region. It maintains bases across the border in
French Basque country.
   In Madrid, Interior Ministry sources speaking on condition of
anonymity said the arrests represented the most important setback to
ETA since police in southwestern France arrested dozens of suspects
in raids on Sept. 30, 1987.
   Urutigoechea and the others were arrested Wednesday in the cities
of Bayonee and Bonloc in southwestern France in Poitiers in
west-central France.
   A police spokeman said on condition of anonymity that authorities
arrested Urutigoechea as he was driving a motorcyle down a towpath
along the Nive River just outside Bayonne. He did not resist, even
though he was armed with a pistol and a grenade, police said. Police
said they arrested two others at a house he had just left, six in
Poitier and one in Bonloc.
   There was no immediate word on whether criminal charges would be
filed against the 10 or whether they would be extradited to Spain.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain told reporters, ``The
police actions and the arrests are of great importance to Spanish
society on such a major matter as the battle against terrorism.''
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
killing more than 600 people, mainly Spanish security and military
forces.
   The arrests came four days after ETA declared a 15-day suspension
of attacks in Spain as a sign of good faith to persuade the Madrid
government to open talks on the Spanish Basque region.
   Authorities in France and Spain said the arrests were carried out
through close cooperation on both sides of the border.
