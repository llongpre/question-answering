<HEAD>Thousands March Against Basque Separatist Violence</HEAD>

   Hundreds of thousands of people marched
through this northern city in the Spanish Basque region Saturday,
demanding an end to Basque separatist violence, news reports said.
   Spanish National Radio said the crowd stretched out more than 1{
miles along the march route through the center of Bilbao.
   The independent SER network estimated the throng of marchers at
``nearly 300,000.'' Police declined to give crowd estimates.
   Representatives of the six major political parties representing
83 percent of the Basque electorate headed the demonstration,
carrying a banner reading ``Peace Now and Forever,'' calling on the
Basque separatist group ETA to lay down its arms.
   On Friday Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the autonomous Basque
regional government, called on the Basque separatist group to extend
indefinitely a cease-fire the separatists first declared Jan. 8 and
renewed 15 days later to extend through March 26, Easter Sunday.
   ETA, an acronym for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque language,
has killed more than 600 people in its 20-year violent campaign to
secure independence for the three-province Spanish Basque country
known as Euskadi.
   ``We have come here today also to make clear our clear desire for
reconciliation,'' Ardanza said. ``We don't want a divided,
conflictive society. We don't want victors or vanquished.''
   There were no reports of incidents during the march that was
supported by organizations ranging from leftist trade unions to the
Red Cross.
   On Jan. 15, the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez resumed talks in Algeria with exiled ETA leader Eugenio
``Antxon'' Etxeveste in Algeria in an attempt to get ETA to give up
its weapons.
   It was not immediately clear what impact the march might have on
the cease-fire or the talks.
   Political observers interpreted wide support shown for the march
as a symbol of the growing public rejection of separatist terrorism
since the major Basque parties in the Basque regional parliament
signed a pact against terrorism on Jan. 19, 1988.
