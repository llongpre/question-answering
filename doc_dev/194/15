   The government on Monday called off talks
with Basque separatists in Algeria after a series of bombings
believed to be the work of the Basque group injured two people.
   The latest injury occurred early Monday, when a mail bomb
exploded at a military training school in the Pyrenee Mountain town
of Jaca. Sgt. Joaquin Borbonado y Ruez was injured and later had
two fingers amputed, a military statement in Barcelona said.
   The attacks began after the Basque separatist group ETA last
week broke off a three-month moratorium on attacks against
government targets. It had declared the moratorium April 4 in
exchange for the talks in Algiers.
   ``The government, with the agreement of the major political
parties, has attempted to carry on a dialogue that would lead to
the elimination of violence in the Basque country and the rest of
Spain,'' Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera told reporters.
   ``Unfortunately, ETA's position of unilaterally ending the hopes
raised to this end obliges the government to put an end to the
dialogue.''
   In addition to the bomb at the military school, police defused a
mail bomb Monday sent to Julen Elgorriaga, a government official in
Vitoria. The city is capital of the three-province Basque region in
northern Spain.
   Later Monday, several thousand people, including Elgorriaga,
marched through the Basque city of Irun to protest a mail bomb that
injured a high school gym teacher there on Friday.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the mail bombs, but
authorities suspect ETA.
   A telephone caller called a travelers' bureau and claimed
responsibility for ETA for a series of rail bombings on Saturday.
No one was injured in those attacks.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for the deaths of more than 600
people in its 21-year campaign to secure self-determination for
their region.
   In his press briefing, Corcuera also said Spain would continue
to request international help in its fight against ETA terrorism.
   Authorities in France have jailed or deported a number of
high-level ETA members. Algeria has received some of those members
but hinted recently that its hospitality might have limits if the
talks fail.
   ETA says the government has failed to live up to its side of the
agreements reached during the first phase of the talks, which began
in mid-January.
   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said
it was only prepared to discuss a way to end violence and how and
when ETA would lay down its arms. It refused to enter into
political negotiations on the future of the Basque country and its
2.1 million residents.
