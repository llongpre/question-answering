   Basque separatists taking seats in
Parliament for the first time boycotted its opening ceremonies
today hours after being attacked by masked gunmen, who killed one
deputy and badly wounded another.
   Both houses of Parliament condemned the assassination of
deputy-elect Jon ``Josu'' Muguruza, 31, of the Popular Union party.
He was pronounced dead on arrival Monday night at Gregorio Maranon
hospital after being shot once in the head while dining in a Madrid
restaurant.
   The second deputy, 41-year-old Inaki Esnaola, was in very
serious condition after six hours of surgery, according to a
hospital statement.
   They said Muguruza and Esnaola were with the five other Basque
parliamentarians and three journalists at a table when the gunmen
attacked.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The Popular Union issued a statement blaming the ``Spanish state
apparatus'' and right-wing terrorists. It called for a general
strike Wednesday in the three-province Basque region to protest the
killings.
   Popular Union spokesman Jon Idigoras said the party's two other
deputies and three senators had decided to boycott today's
ceremonies, which they believed should have been canceled following
the assassination.
   But he told reporters that his party, generally considered the
political wing of the armed separatist group ETA, would still
participate in Parliament for the first time since Spain's return
to democracy in 1977.
   ``If they think they're going to intimidate us ... they're
wrong,'' Idigoras said. The politicians were all elected in Oct. 29
voting.
   Popular Union spokesman Xabier Oleaga said on Saturday that the
party Batasuna had decided to take its seats because it believed
there would be new peace negotiations between the government and
ETA.
   He said the party wants to be present in Parliament to present
its side of the issues.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed
more than 600 people. It began its violent campaign for
independence from Spain in 1968.
   Monday's shooting drew condemnation from all major political
parties and the Socialist-led government.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said the attack was ``as
horrendous as all terrorist acts ... and without doubt an attack
against the pacification process'' in the Basque region.
   Government spokeswoman Rosa Conde called it an attack against
democracy and said ``the full weight of the law will fall on those
responsible.''
   Anonymous callers to several radio stations in the Basque region
said today that the attack had been carried out by the
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, a shadowy organization that some
people link to the police.
   In the hours after the attack, police in the Basque region
reported several incidents, including the explosion of a small bomb
outside a branch office of the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya bank in the
town of Santurce. The bomb damaged a car but caused no injuries,
they said.
   Molotov cocktails started fires at a train station in the town
of Villabona and a bank in Onate, police said.
   The head of the conservative Popular Party, Jose Maria Aznar,
told reporters he deplored the attack. But he added that the Basque
party's outrage seemed hollow since it had never condemned the
deaths of ETA's victims.
   On Sunday, ETA claimed responsibility for the death of an army
lieutenant colonel gunned down in a car in downtown Madrid last
week. He was the 17th victim of ETA violence this year.
   The Gonzalez government began exploratory peace talks with
exiled ETA leaders in Algeria earlier this year but canceled them
in April when ETA terrorists renewed their attacks.
