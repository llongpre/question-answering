No clear majority emerged yesterday in regional elections in Spain's Basque
region where Madrid-based parties made strong gains at the expense of local
nationalist parties. With 99 per cent of votes counted the governing Basque
Nationalist party (PNV), the mainstream nationalist party, had equalled its
former standing by taking 22 seats. However the Basque Socialist party
(PSE), its junior coalition partner in the Basque government, fell from 16
seats to 12, and it appeared their combined total of seats would fall short
of an overall majority in the 75-member Basque parliament.
Underlining a shift away from narrow-based nationalist politics, Herri
Batasuna, the radical Basque coalition which supports the ETA separatist
group, also lost support, taking 11 seats against 13 in the 1990 elections.
The conservative Popular Party (PP) Spain's main opposition party, increased
its six seats in the outgoing to Basque legislature to 11, and the Communist
party-led Izquierda Unida, IU, which had no representatives in the outgoing
parliament was expected to return six members. Officials said 60 per cent of
the 1.7m eligible voters went to the polls.
