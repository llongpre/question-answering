<F P=106> [Xavier Ventura report: "Arzalluz Asserts That Government's </F>
Autonomy Policy Is Schizophrenic and Farcical"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) 
Chairman Xabier Arzalluz yesterday accused the central 
government of practicing "schizophrenia and a farce" by tending 
increasingly toward the creation of a unitary state, although 
saying that this is not so. Arzalluz made these statements in 
Barcelona at the conclusion of the meeting of the PNV and 
Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) Executive Committees, at 
which the two Christian Democratic parties decided to demand of 
the government that it drop its centralist criteria in European 
building and allow the presence of representatives of the 
Catalan and Basque governments in Community institutions. 
  Arzalluz showed himself "optimistic," albeit with 
reservations, when referring to the negotiation with the 
Socialists on the pending transfers [of areas of responsibility] 
to the Basque Country, and so asked Felipe Gonzalez to continue 
contacts in order to find a "political solution." The Basque 
leader said that the PNV's observance of the Constitution 
depends on the implementation of the autonomy statute, and so, 
if this process is not carried out, a "very grave" situation 
will be reached. Arzalluz also pointed out that the agreement 
on the statute had as its background observance of the 
constitutional system by the PNV, since the party did not 
approve the Constitution. In view of this he warned that "we 
cannot allow implementation of the statute not being completed" 
in the current legislative term, the government's "refusing to 
implement it," or, if it does so, subsequently "undermining" it 
through laws, decrees, or Constitutional Court rulings. 
  The meeting between Union and the PNV -- the first of the 
meetings which will henceforth be held every six months -- was 
basically aimed at establishing a joint stance on the presence 
of Catalonia and the Basque Country in the European Union. In 
this connection the two parties believe that the Spanish state 
is the "most centralist" in its European role and demand that 
the autonomous governments' presence in Community institutions 
be ensured, and also that the autonomous communities be able to 
take part in the state's political stance on European issues, as 
is the case in Belgium and Germany, for instance. 
  To achieve this, Union leader Josep Antoni Duran Lleida 
explained, the electoral law for the European elections must be 
amended, replacing the single constituency covering the whole of 
Spain with regional constituencies. They also demand the 
involvement of the Catalan and Basque governments in the 
allocation of Community funds, and the political normalization 
of the missions which both autonomous communities have abroad. 
Arzalluz asserted that the European integration process is 
being carried out with "centralist criteria" and that it is 
being used to enable the central government to "take back 
power," since "a standardization process is being attempted in 
Spain in the name of European unity." 
  In addition, the two parties reiterated their intention to 
put forward a joint program in the European elections since 
their European deputies are in the same group in the European 
parliament. UDC and the PNV did not raise at this meeting the 
possibility of running together in the European elections, as 
the Basque party proposed in 1989 -- a request opposed by 
Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC). Arzalluz said that 
"we are already running together, albeit not on the same list," 
although he asserted that the Basques "are not coming to 
separate anything in Catalonia," while Duran asserted that Union 
"gives priority to the coalition with CDC" and rules out running 
with the PNV, even though he still believes that "we would like 
to run together."
