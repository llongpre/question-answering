<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Condemnation of Speech by Arzalluz, </F>
Who Is Accused of Isolating Basque Country"] 
  [Excerpt] Bilbao -- Several political leaders yesterday 
harshly criticized the remarks of PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] 
Chairman Xabier Arzalluz, who referred on Aberri Eguna [Basque 
fatherland day] to those who "talk a great deal about ETA 
[Basque Homeland and Liberty], when they have headings and 
articles in their Constitution, designed for Reds and 
separatists, in which they entrust their fatherland's unity to 
the Army, weapons, and violence." The leaders of the nationwide 
parties in the Basque Country accused Arzalluz of isolating the 
Basque Country through his radicalism, which, in the opinion of 
both the PSE [Basque Socialist Party] and the People's Party of 
the Basque Country, stems from the proximity of the Basque 
autonomous community elections. 
  The harshest criticisms yesterday came from the Basque 
Socialists, of whom Aznar said a few days ago that they are not 
Basques. Nicolas Redondo Terreros, secretary general of the PSE 
of Vizcaya, said that Arzalluz' remarks are "intolerable" and 
show "separatism," although he specified that the problem is not 
between the Basque Country and the rest of Spain "but among the 
Basques themselves, because there are many of us Basques who do 
not share Mr. Arzalluz' idea of the Basque Country and Spain at 
all." 
  PSE Deputy Secretary General Jose Luis Marcos Merino also 
criticized the remarks by Arzalluz, whom he called a "crank," 
and said that his remarks are "nonsense" and have no 
justification, because "to compare ETA with the Army and Article 
8 of the Constitution is an act of total cynicism and a lie." 
Marcos Merino added that "so many foolish remarks and in such 
close succession are inexplicable, unless the PNV leaders are 
suffering from delirium and hallucinations." 
  In Marcos Merino's opinion, Arzalluz' statements do not help 
the Basque Country to surmount the economic crisis which it is 
suffering, "but isolate us increasingly." 
  Jaime Mayor Oreja, chairman of the People's Party in the 
Basque Country, spoke in similar terms, accusing the PNV 
chairman of isolating the Basque Country through statements such 
as these, "which are the best demonstration of a political 
fiction which has been so damaging and counterproductive for the 
Basque Country." In Mayor Oreja's opinion, "those statements do 
not further the quest to resolve the Basque Country's real 
problems, and are a political fiction." 
<H5>  Regain Prominence </H5>
  In the opinion of the People's Party of the Basque Country, 
what the PNV leaders are seeking through statements such as 
their chairman's is to "regain prominence and increase the 
political justification of the nationalist parties and, more 
specifically, of the PNV," in view of the elections' proximity. 
In Mayor Oreja's opinion, what Arzalluz is attempting to this 
end is to "divide deeply the Basque people" and "cause a scandal 
and reaction throughout Spain through radicalism," although he 
said that the questioning of the Army's role in the defense of 
Spain's unity did not surprise them. 
  On relations between the People's Party and the PNV 
following 
the meeting with Arzalluz, he said that "meeting points must 
always be explored within the substantial and very considerable 
differences," and added that "there is no possibility of 
agreement" on these matters. [passage omitted]
