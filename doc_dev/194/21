<F P=106> [Report by V. Ruiz de Azua and L.R. Aizpeolea: "Aznar and </F>
Arzalluz Normalize Relations With Their Second Meeting in Two 
Months"] 
  [Text] The People's Party [PP] and the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party] are continuing with the normalization of 
their relations. Their two chairmen -- Jose Maria Aznar and 
Xabier Arzalluz -- held a meeting lasting almost two hours in 
Madrid yesterday, on the former's initiative. Aznar invited 
Arzalluz to his home and then accompanied him to a shopping mall 
so that his companion, nationalist leader Juan Maria Ollora, 
could buy a book on the fall of Mario Conde. According to 
sources in the two parties, the conversation was cordial, and 
occurred "irrespective" of the political differences. 
  The PNV does not share the PP's stance of censuring the 
government, while Aznar holds the PNV and its chairman jointly 
responsible for the impossibility of submitting a censure 
motion. However, the two leaders have held a meeting for the 
second time in two months, and, also for the second time, 
Arzalluz has stated that Aznar seems to him "a good person," and 
that he would trust him to conclude an agreement. The previous 
meeting took place secretly around Easter Week in Burgos, midway 
between Madrid and Bilbao. 
  On this occasion, however, Arzalluz agreed to visit Aznar in 
the morning in his office at PP headquarters, at 13 Genova 
Street in Madrid. When the date of the meeting became known the 
day before yesterday, the PP chairman offered him the 
possibility of going to his home to avoid being hounded by 
cameras. 
  The normalization of relations with the PP enables the PNV 
chairman to reaffirm his independence from the Socialists, with 
whom he is governing in a coalition in the Basque Country. It 
enables Aznar to show that, despite the disagreements, he is 
keeping channels of communication with other parliamentary 
parties open, and that the current disagreement does not mean 
isolation. 
  The conversation was attended by Basque PP Chairman Jaime 
Mayor Oreja and PNV leader Juan Maria Ollora. The two men, with 
other leaders of each party, will undertake to study over the 
next few weeks the PNV's autonomy proposals, which Arzalluz had 
already handed to his interlocutor in Burgos, contained in 
several documents. 
  Mayor Oreja stated in the afternoon that everything was 
discussed a little without prior order, without trying to seek 
any commitment or change of stance by either side. The PNV 
emphasized to the PP its intention to shun extremist stances 
with respect to the Socialist government, intimating that it 
will not take part in a destructive strategy or one of all-out 
resistance. 
  In this connection, Arzalluz asked Aznar to tone down the 
political strategy of tension maintained by the PP, using the 
corruption scandals. The PNV chairman told his host that the 
strategy that "seeks to erode leads to nothing good," according 
to nationalist sources. 
<H5>  Joint Study </H5>
  The PP and nationalist leaders took up again some of the 
matters that were discussed in the conversation held 29 March in 
Burgos. On that occasion, the possibility of setting up a kind 
of committee to study together the implementation of the Gernika 
Statute was raised. This idea of PP Deputy Secretary General 
Mariano Rajoy caught on at yesterday's meeting in producing a 
response from another of those attending the meeting -- Juan 
Maria Ollora. Both Mayor Oreja and Ollora will hold contacts 
and extend them successively with contributions from [Basque 
autonomous government] Councilor of the President's Office 
Joseba Zubia and Councilor of Finance Juan Luis Larrea -- both 
belonging to the PNV -- who are the negotiators on autonomy with 
the central administration. 
  The nationalists believe that this interchange is necessary 
in view of the uncertainty of the political scene that is 
developing not only in Spain but also in the Basque Country 
itself. Next fall's autonomous community elections leave the 
scene open, in the nationalists' opinion, and although the most 
likely outcome is that the current government coalition of 
Socialists and nationalists will continue, a result leading to a 
new government combination in which the PNV's new partner would 
be the PP is not ruled out. 
  But the central aim of the meeting -- arranged last week 
before Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra's appearance in the 
Congress [of Deputies] to answer questions on the Roldan affair 
-- was to relax relations between the two parties. "We are 
experiencing a time when we should all discuss everything, and 
not just in parliament," Arzalluz said yesterday, shortly before 
his meeting with Aznar. Later, nationalist sources close to the 
participants stated that the meeting was "cordial and relaxed." 
"Discussion between the leaders moderates language. The PNV is 
not at the eye of the PP's storm, nor is the PP at the eye of 
the PNV's storm. This meeting will help to calm the general 
political scene," the same sources said.
