greater regional autonomy are growing stronger

RUNNING SPAIN must sometimes feel a little like drifting on a liferaft of
oil drums tied together with thin string. The longer the craft stays in the
water the weaker the binding becomes and the cans begin to move ominously.
Although bound by the 1978 Constitution, the 17 autonomous regions that make
up modern Spain are beginning to jostle about, rubbing up against each other
and pressing the central government for more autonomy. The problem is not
that the raft is falling apart but rather that it is costing Madrid a lot
more money to keep it together.
With Spain's public sector deficit running at 4.4 per cent of GDP
(opposition parties claim it is much higher) a recent OECD report on the
Spanish economy surprised no-one by insisting that 'one of the main causes
for high deficits is expansionary policy by regional governments'.
While the central government deficit has been falling since 1985, regional
debt has risen from 0.3 per cent of GDP in 1985 to more than 1.5 per cent
last year. The OECD accuses the regions of spending money on flashy projects
and of paying their civil servants - many of whom duplicate jobs being done
in Madrid - more than central government pays its own.
Frustrated by Madrid's reluctance to throw more money at them, the regions
have begun to tap local and international capital markets for funds. Many
are close to breaching their legal debt limits - interest payments may not
be more than 25 per cent of revenues - and one, Cantabria, technically
bankrupted itself last year.
The OECD calls on Madrid (in truth, OECD country reports are usually written
with the assistance of the Finance Ministry concerned) to tighten up these
limits and to make it clear to lenders that the State is not underwriting
regional borrowing.
But that misses the crucial political point. The borrowing is just a symptom
of the tremendous head of regionalist political steam built up because of
the federal vision held out by the 1978 Constitution. Although the complex
constitutional system gives some regions - Catalonia, the Basque Country,
Galicia and Andalucia - more autonomy more rapidly than the others, all 17
regions are basically promised the freedom, in time, to run their internal
affairs.
Madrid's difficulty is that it never really rid itself of the centralist
tradition inherited from Franco and is trying to grant autonomy at its pace
while many of the regions run by regional parties are trying to grab, in
Madrid's view, too much too quickly. It is arguable that devolved power can
never create a true federation anyway and that federal states such as
Germany and the US function because the devolution went the other way - from
the states to the centre.
The tension between regions and Madrid stands to reason: the politics of the
regions are fundamentally nationalist, or even ethnic. It is essential to
the electability of a regional party that Madrid be painted as an inadequate
provider, as a distributor of Catalan taxes to Extremadura or of encouraging
investment in Andalucia at the Basque Country's expense.
Much of this is game playing. But it can sound very threatening. Both
Catalonia and the Basque Country are run by conservative nationalist parties
whose leaders periodically say almost seditious things. Last year, the
Catalan leader observed that Catalonia was in a very similar situation to
Lithuania, which was then becoming independent of the former Soviet Union.
Did he mean Catalonia should be independent too?
He said no, not at all, and then promptly began to press Madrid for more
money and, to his horror, had his bluff called. In negotiations last year to
redesign the financial arrangements between the regions and Madrid Catalonia
began to press loudly for the right to be able to spend the taxes raised in
Catalonia. Madrid soon shut this up by suggesting the Catalan government
might like to raise these taxes itself too, as the Basques do.
This was not what the Catalans had in mind. Raising (in the sense of
collecting or increasing) taxes is not a politically attractive thing to do.
The Catalan Government simply wanted to spend what Madrid had collected. So
the demand was quietly dropped.
But the fuss about more autonomy is not just a harmless struggle for money.
Slowly but surely it is changing the face of Spanish politics as the large
centralist parties weaken and the regionalists grow. It is quite possible,
for instance, that the next Spanish general election (to be held between now
and October next year) will force Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's
socialists into a coalition with either the ruling Catalan CiU or the ruling
Basque PNV. Both these parties send MPs to Madrid and the CiU is the third
largest party in the House.
The large conservative opposition, the Partido Popular (PP), has also been
forced to compromise. In Navarra, for instance, it has an agreement under
which it supports the ruling UPN in regional elections and in turn expects
the UPN vote to come to it in general elections. The PP has also formed
alliances with regionalist groups in Aragon and local ones in Valencia and
Seville.
At another level, regions controlled by socialist party or PP leaders are
also being forced to champion regional themes with which their centralist
party leaderships are uncomfortable. In socialist Andalucia, for example,
the regional government fights constant skirmishes with Madrid over health
policy. Andalucia is one of the few regions with its own health service and
claims Madrid, in order to save money, constantly delays making budgeted
transfers to Seville which, in turn, borrows money in the capital markets to
make up shortfalls and thus infuriates Madrid.
Meanwhile, Galicia, which the PP controls through its maverick founder, the
former Francoist minister Manuel Fraga, is leading a sudden charge to
redesign totally the way the historic autonomies - Catalonia, the Basque
Country and Galicia - are run. He has called for the creation of a single
administration in each territory, meaning that centrally appointed civil
governors and other officials would be withdrawn. Madrid would thus delegate
all its powers - including control of the police - to the leader in these
regions.
It just happens that the socialists control none of the three historic
autonomies (though they are the junior coalition partner in the Basque
Country) and the idea therefore is unlikely to get very far now. But
Catalonia's leadership likes it and single administration may yet make
headway if the Catalan CiU is able to force the socialists into a coalition
after the next national election.
For the CiU and the Basque PNV, the need to be seen to be making progress on
questions of autonomy (even if it is sometimes illusory) is critical because
they are constantly being chased in their own backyards by smaller parties
which genuinely want independence for their regions and not just more
national resources.
This is even beginning now in Aragon and while Basque separatists regularly
take about 16 per cent of the Basque vote there has been a sharp increase in
support recently for the separatist Catalan party ERC. That is a direct
result of the Catalan leader, Mr Jordi Pujol, exciting nationalist fervour,
and backing off. Whenever he does this he leaves a separatist residue for
the ERC to pick up.
