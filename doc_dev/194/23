   Thousands of mourners accompanied the body
of a slain Basque politician through city streets today, and
demonstrators around the Basque region burned barricades and closed
businesses to protest his death.
   Jon ``Josu'' Muguruza was killed Monday by two suspected
right-wing gunmen as he sat in a Madrid restaurant with other
Basque legislators of his radical coalition, the Herri Batasuna
(Popular Union) Party. He was elected to parliament Oct. 29.
   Muguruza's body, accompanied by 5,000 supporters waving Basque
flags and chanting anti-government slogans, was carried to city
hall, where it will lie in state.
   A second deputy-elect from the same party was shot in the
attack, which came on the eve of the swearing-in ceremonies for the
new Parliament. He has improved considerably since undergoing
surgery for four bullet wounds, doctors said.
   Herri Batasuna is widely regarded as the political wing of the
separatist group ETA, which claims responsibility for attacks that
have killed more than 600 people in a 21-year campaign for
independence for the Spanish Basque region.
   Most businesses in the region closed for the day, heeding the
party's call for a general strike or succumbing to pressure from
roving groups of protesters who advised them not to open, news
reports said.
   Youths burned barricades on highways in the three Basque
provinces and neighboring Navarre, and officials suspended bus
service in the provincial capitals of San Sebastian, Bilbao,
Vitoria and the Navarran capital, Pamplona.
   One resident of the town of Santurce, who identified herself
only as Susana, told Spanish radio that masked youths had shut down
her bread store. ``We're scared,'' she said.
   Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has called the shooting
``horrendous'' and said apprehending the gunmen was a top priority
for the government.
   Several Spanish dailies, citing Interior Ministry sources, said
investigators believe the two men who burst into the Madrid
restaurant and opened fire with pistols were aiming at the injured
politician, Inaki Esnaola, and accidentally killed Muguruza.
   Two other deputies, three senators and three others were seated
at the table but uninjured in the attack.
   The dailies said the fact that the attack occurred on the 14th
anniversary of the death of authoritarian ruler Gen. Francisco
Franco, and that the gunmen used military-issue ammunition, led
police to suspect a link with ultra-right army factions.
   ``(The) attack ... bears the unmistakable signs of fascism,''
leading daily El Pais said in an editorial.
   Both Muguruza, who was 31, and the 41-year-old Esnaola were
regarded as ``moderates'' who favored the resumption of talks
between government representatives and ETA, suspended by Gonzalez
in April after ETA broke a moratorium on its attacks.
   They also supported Herri Batasuna's decision to take its seats
in Parliament for the first time since the country's return to
democracy in 1977 _a decision party spokesman Jon Idigoras said it
would stick to, despite the attack.
   Until now, Herri Batasuna members had refused to swear
allegiance to the 1978 Spanish constitution, a prerequisite for
parliamentary participation.
