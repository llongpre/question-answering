   Two masked gunmen entered a hotel Monday
and opened fire on a group of Basque politicians, killing one
elected legislator and wounding another, police reported.
   They identified the victims as Jon Muguruza, 31, and Inaki
Esnaola, 41, both elected to Parliament's lower house in the Oct.
29 balloting. Officials at Gregorio Maranon Hospital said Muguruza
was dead on arrival and Esnaola was in grave condition with two
bullet wounds in the head.
   Both were supporters of the militant Basque separatist
organization ETA.
   It was believed to be the first assassination of a Spanish
parliamentarian since before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War
in 1936.
   Muguruza and Esnaola were among four deputies and three senators
of the Basque party Herri Batasuna (Popular Union) who were to
swear allegiance to Spain Tuesday before being installed in
Parliament.
   Police said no group asserted responsibility for the attack that
occurred in the restaurant of the Hotel Alcala at 11 p.m.
   They said Muguruza and Esnaola were with the five other elected
Basque parliamentarians and three journalists seated around a table
when the gunmen attacked. The journalists are employees of the
Basque newspaper Egin.
   All members of the 350-seat lower house of Parliament (Cortes)
are to swear allegiance Tuesday to the constitution _ the first
step in the process of establishing a new Parliament that King Juan
Carlos is to open December 6.
   It is the first time since democracy was restored in 1977 that
Basque separatists elected to Parliament planned to swear
allegiance and take their seats. Other Basques politicians have
been elected to Parliament but refused to take the oath and were
not seated.
   Esnaola said in a recent interview that he and his colleagues
would swear allegiance under duress ``because I am forced to by
law.'' He said the Basque deputies and senators would serve in
Parliament so they could speak out for self-determination for the
Basque region in northern Spain and serve as mediators in
negotiations between the government and outlawed ETA.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language for Basque land and
liberty.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist Party won the October
elections.
   His government began exploratory peace talks with exiled ETA
leaders in Algiers earlier this year but canceled them April when
ETA terrorists renewed their attacks.
   The Basque legislators were shot on the 14th anniversary of the
death of Gen. Francisco Franco, who eliminated the historic
political rights of the Spanish Basques after his forces won the
Civil War in 1939.
   The Basque Popular Union is regarded as the political wing of
the ETA.
   Over the past 21 years, ETA has claimed responsibility for the
killings of more than 600 people, with most of the victims police
or military officers.
   Basque Populars Unity has won 10-15 percent of the vote in the
three Basque provinces, with a population of 2.1 million, since
1979.
   Muguruzu was an elected deputy from Vizcaya province and Esnaola
from Guipuzcoa province.
