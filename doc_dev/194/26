Attempts by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to regain the political
initiative have suffered a significant setback in regional elections in the
Basque country, where conservatives and communists made strong gains at the
expense of his Socialist party.
The Basque elections on Sunday were won, as expected, by the mainstream
nationalist party, the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV), which regained the
22 seats it had held in the outgoing 75-member regional parliament. But
despite an active campaign by Mr Gonzalez, the Socialist party, which had
been the junior coalition partner in the PNV-led Basque government, lost
four of its 16 seats in the local legislature, its worst electoral result in
the region.
In a highly fragmented vote that will make creation of a new governing
majority difficult, the conservative Partido Popular (PP) gained 11 seats,
up from six, and the communist-led Izquierda Unida group (IU), which
previously had no members in the Basque parliament, returned six.
Sunday's poll underlined the sharp fall in support for the prime minister
that emerged last June when the PP established a 10-point lead over the
Socialists to win the European parliament elections, and when both the PP
and IU doubled their vote in Andalucia, Mr Gonzalez's home region, causing
the Socialist party to lose its majority in local elections held on the same
day.
Mr Gonzalez, who was returned to power for a fourth term in 1993 although
without an overall majority, is blamed for a severe recession that has
raised unemployment to a record level and for a series of corruption
scandals that rocked his government earlier this year.
June's defeats propelled the often reclusive prime minister into a hectic
schedule of parliamentary appearences, public meetings, television 'fireside
chats' and media interviews. However, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, PP leader, said
yesterday the Basque poll had confirmed 'the unstoppable decline of the
socialist vote'.
Analysts said the Socialists had probably been penalised in the Basque
elections for co-opting a local left-wing party, Euzkadiko Ezkerra, on to
its ticket and campaigning for the 'ethnic' Basque vote. Traditional
socialist voters in the area are mainly immigrants from elsewhere in Spain
or their descendants.
Mr Gonzalez's popularity will next be tested in municipal elections in May,
as well as in polls to elect new parliaments in 13 of Spain's 17 autonomous
regions.
The responsibility for leading the Basque executive, meanwhile, falls once
more to the PNV, which has governed the area, either on its own on in
coalition with the Socialists, since 1980.
