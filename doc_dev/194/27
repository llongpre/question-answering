   Assailants believed to be Basque
separatists fired grenades at a Civil Guard barracks in northern
Spain today and bombed a convoy near another northern town. At least
three men were wounded, police said.
   A police spokesman said at least two officers were hurt when a
four-vehicle Civil Guard convoy was bombed on a highway near the
northern Basque town of Areta, six miles south of the port of Bilbao.
   The spokesman said a passerby also was believed hurt.
   The blast came about eight hours after assailants launched a
rocket-propelled grenade attack on a Civil Guard barracks outside
Alsasua after apparently planting booby traps in the area, a Civil
Guard spokesman said. Asusua is in the Navarre region that borders
the northern Basque country.
   One Civil Guard officer was seriously injured when he tripped a
booby-trap bomb, said the spokesman, who was not identified in
keeping with custom. At least two other hidden bombs failed to
detonate and two were defused, he said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but
police said both bore the earmarks of ETA, the Basque separatist
organization.
   The group has carried out a 20-year violent campaign in an effort
to secure independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region and to seek annexation of the bordering autonomous
region of Navarre.
   Alsasua lies on the border with the Basque region, 30 miles east
of Pamplona, the Navarre region's capital.
   A spokesman at Pamplona's University Clinic hospital said the
booby-trap blast blew away parts of both legs of guard Jose Aguilar
Garcia, 26.
   In another development, a gunman believed to be an ETA member
killed Thursday the owner of a bar in Zarauz, a town in the Basque
province of Guizpuzcoa. Authorities called the shooting of
Engraciano Gonzalez Macho, 42, ``a clear ETA attack,'' adding that
the gunman was believed to be the same man who triggered a car bomb
Sunday that killed a policeman and injured 12 people in Eibar, 25
miles east of San Sebastian.
   Since 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than
600 people, mainly Civil Guard, police and military officers.
   So far this year ETA-claimed attacks have killed 17 people.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language for Homeland and Liberty.
