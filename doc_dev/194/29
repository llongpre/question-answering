<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the Basque </F>
Country autonomous government, at his home in Ajuria Enea, by 
Ana de Benavides; date not given: "Ardanza Claims Gonzalez 
Government Has `Toyed' With Basques"] 
  [Excerpt] From his residence in Ajuria Enea, Jose Antonio 
Ardanza is waiting anxiously to learn the policy of the new 
interior minister, Antoni Asuncion; is saddened by the latest 
ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty Group] attack, which was 
aimed directly at the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]; and is 
irritated at the Spanish Government's failure to move ahead on 
the Guernica Charter. The Basque leader maintains that Felipe 
Gonzalez's policy of making ad hoc coalitions with disparate 
parties is "not intelligent." 
  [de Benavides] As the sergeant major of the Ertzaintza 
[Basque Autonomous Police] lay at death's door, I was asking 
myself: How long will the ETA continue? 
  [Ardanza] Until they decide to change. We have exhausted 
every possible way of reaching out to them. The Ajuria Enea 
accord laid out the framework for a solution, so there is no 
need for further speculation about what ought to be done. How 
long will the ETA continue? Until they decide, once and for all, 
that agreeing to play by the rules of the democratic game does 
not constitute a surrender or humiliation of any kind. 
  [de Benavides] I presume that this latest attack throws into 
question the path of dialogue with the terrorist organization. 
  [Ardanza] If they interpret dialogue as just a way to see 
how 
many more concessions they can extract from their interlocutors, 
then yes, dialogue would be a mistake. Sure, let's have 
dialogue, so long as the goal is to arrive at a definitive 
solution. It is difficult to change ETA's attitudes through 
police action alone, since standing behind ETA are the voters of 
HB [Herri Batasuna]. If we want to convince these people they 
must integrate themselves into the life of democracy, we must 
formulate a solution through dialogue, though admittedly at the 
present moment there is little enthusiasm for further talk. 
  [de Benavides] You were always optimistic about the ETA's 
eventual fate. You even ventured the opinion that the highway 
might solve the problem. 
  [Ardanza] I continue to be optimistic, but I never predicted 
when success would come. We have reached a point in time where 
the ETA is politically a failed option. It may be able to hang 
on to the support it still has in HB, but the rest of society 
completely, unequivocally, and fearlessly rejects it, saying 
"Enough already--we don't need to be `saved'." 
  [de Benavides] But ETA still exists, and keeps on killing. 
  [Ardanza] Neither within the political sector nor in society 
as a whole does the ETA figure among the highest-priority 
issues. The citizenry are not terribly concerned about the ETA 
anymore. They worry more about the economic recession and the 
slowdown in industry. [passage omitted on other topics]
