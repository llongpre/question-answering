<F P=106> [Article by Peter Strafford: "The Economic Pain in Spain"] </F>
  [Text] After several years of growing self-confidence in 
the late 1980s, culminating in the festivities of 1992, when it 
celebrated the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's 
discovery of the New World, Spain is suffering from a hangover. 
It is not alone in this, at a time of recession in Europe. But 
economic difficulties are hitting the Spanish particularly hard, 
with, for instance, an estimated 23 per cent or more unemployed. 
  At the same time the socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez 
has been weakened politically. The socialist party (PSOE) 
emerged as the winner in last June's general election, in spite 
of expectations that it would be overtaken by the conservative 
Partido Popular (PP) [People's Party], but it lost the overall 
majority in parliament it had held since 1982. 
  Senor Gonzalez tried to form a coalition with two 
nationalist 
parties, Convergencia i Unio (CiU) [Convergence and Union] of 
Catalonia and the Partido Nacional Vasco (PNV) [Basque National 
Party] of the Basque country, with which he would have commanded 
a permanent majority, but this proved impossible. So he now 
heads a minority government which needs to win support from 
elsewhere for each of its legislative measures. 
  For the parties of the opposition, all this implies that 
after being in power for nearly 12 years, the socialists are 
approaching the end of the line. Jose Maria Aznar, leader of 
the PP, told THE TIMES that though in the end his party had not 
won last Junes election, it had increased its votes from 
5,200,000 to 8,200,000. It made its appeal to the young, 
particularly professionals and townspeople in general, and was a 
clear alternative to the socialists. 
  Inaki Anasagasti, parliamentary leader of the PNV, talked of 
"the end of an epoch," and said that Senor Gonzalez, the 
towering figure in Spanish politics since 1982, was "tired." 
  This is not the way the socialists see it, however, and, 
faced with an admittedly difficult situation, they are fighting 
back confidently. Narcis Serra, the deputy prime minister, who 
is himself a Catalan, said there were signs that Spain was 
emerging from recession. "Statistics for the second half of 
1993 show a change in the trend," he told THE TIMES. "There 
won't be a sudden change for the better, but we are slowly 
getting out." 
  Spanish companies were improving their profits, Senor Serra 
said, interest rates were still going down, and the favourable 
exchange rate for the peseta, after three devaluations, was 
helping the growth of exports. If other European countries 
picked up, so would Spain. 
  Senor Serra conceded that having only a minority government 
made things more difficult, but claimed that the results so far 
were "not bad." The government had received the support of the 
CiU and the PNV for austerity measures in the budget for 1994, 
adopted last autumn; and this was followed by an overwhelming 
parliamentary majority last month, including the PP, for an 
important series of reforms to the laws on employment. 
  Other reforms were either under way or planned, Senor Serra 
said, with two overall aims: to allow companies to become more 
competitive without reducing the number of employees, and to 
adjust the Spanish labour market to wider European conditions. 
  The underlying question is whether the government will have 
the will, and the political muscle, not just to pull Spain out 
of recession, but to carry through some fundamental reforms that 
are thought to be needed if the Spanish economy is to become 
competitive in the European Union. Since democracy returned to 
Spain after the death of General Franco in 1975, the overriding 
aim of all Spanish governments has been to overcome the 
backwardness and isolation the country had known for many years; 
and with the rapid growth of the 1980s there were hopes of 
achieving that. 
  The onset of recession has revealed continuing weaknesses, 
however, and steps have been taken to address them. One was the 
rigidity of the employment laws, some not so different from 
those of the Franco era. The new legislation is designed to 
improve that by, for instance, allowing for part-time 
employment, and the taking on of young people as apprentices at 
lower wage levels, and in general making it easier to hire and 
fire. 
  For the moment, difficulties have been crowding in on the 
socialists thick and fast. In December, Promocion Social de 
Viviendas, a housing cooperative run by the Union General de 
Trabajadores (UGT) [General Workers Union], the big socialist 
trade union confederation, collapsed; and this was followed by 
the near-collapse of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), Spain's 
fourth-largest bank, leading to the dismissal of its board by 
the Bank of Spain and the appointment of a new team. 
  On January 27, the UGT and the Comisiones Obreras [Workers 
Commissions], the other main union confederation, called a 
one-day general strike in protest against the new employment 
legislation. 
  The strike slowed Spain down for a day, but it is not 
expected to deter the government from its reform policies. It 
reflected the differences between a socialist government that 
has long been one of the most pragmatic and market-orientated in 
Europe and its former supporters in the unions. These 
differences are still being fought out inside the PSOE, where 
Senor Gonzalez has tried to shake off the influence of the left, 
and will come to a head at a party congress next month. 
  In the background is the age-old tension between Madrid and 
the Spanish regions, whose most extreme manifestation is the 
continuing, though weakened, terrorist campaign by Euskadi Ta 
Askatasuna (ETA) [Basque Homeland and Liberty], the Basque 
independence movement. The fact that the government is dependent 
on support from the CiU and the PNV in parliament has given 
moderate Catalan and Basque nationalists a greater degree of 
leverage. Both parties are basically in sympathy with the 
current reform moves, but have been pressing for the granting of 
greater autonomous powers in return. 
  At Catalan insistence, a new arrangement for the funding of 
the regions was agreed last autumn. This did not help the 
Basques, however, and both Miquel Roca, parliamentary leader of 
the CiU, and Senor Anasagasti want more. The Madrid government, 
they say, has still not fully carried out the terms of their 
original autonomy statutes, dating back to 1979. 
  There are significant differences between the Catalans, more 
numerous and prosperous, and the Basques. Senor Roca points out 
emphatically that the CiU is not a separatist party, and 
sometimes gives the impression that the party's aim is, far from 
secession from Spain, rather influence over the whole country. 
  Senor Anasagasti, on the other hand, caused a storm last 
month by publicly protesting against a speech by King Juan 
Carlos, made before a military audience, in which he made an 
oblique, and mild, reference to regional differences. "The 
diversity which enriches us," the King said, "must unite us 
rather than separate us." 
  By tradition, statements by the King are not publicly 
criticised in Spain, but Senor Anasagasti said that the speech 
had been "neither balanced nor just," and this was followed by 
fiery statements by other PNV leaders attacking the army and the 
Guardia Civil, the paramilitary police. 
  Senor Anasagasti said later that his objection was 
essentially to the audience before whom the King had spoken, 
since the position of the King should not be based just on 
"bayonets," but on the various constitutional bodies. He denied 
it, but the assumption in other parties is that the PNV was 
looking ahead to the regional election in the Basque Country 
this autumn, when it does not want to be outflanked by the 
extreme nationalists. 
  In its foreign policy, the Spanish government retains its 
belief in closer integration in the EU [European Union], based 
on the Maastricht Treaty and going beyond it. This is in spite 
of recent difficulties in the exchange rate mechanism, which led 
to the devaluations of the peseta, and the more general 
disenchantment with the integration process. 
  Spain has demonstrated its greater involvement in 
international affairs by sending troops to Bosnia, and taking 
part in other United Nations operations in Angola and 
Mozambique. Within the EU, it has pressed for more attention to 
be paid to future tensions in North Africa, with its growing 
populations and its political, religious and economic 
difficulties. 
  Officials concede that as a result of recent difficulties in 
the EU, and the recession, public enthusiasm for the process of 
European integration has waned in Spain. But Senor Serra says 
that enthusiasm would revive once the recession ended, and that 
Spain continues to believe in monetary union. "Europe has to 
deepen both its economic and its political union. That will 
give Spain a stronger position."
