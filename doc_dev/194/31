   A powerful explosion tore through the
headquarters of the paramilitary Civil Guard shortly before midnight
Tuesday, killing one person and wounding 45, officials said.
   Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera said a small van parked on
the sidewalk next to the Civil Guard headquarters exploded at 11:48
p.m. (5:48 p.m. EST) in a residential neighborhood.
   He said the dead man was an unidentified civilian.
   Corcuera said there were unconfirmed reports that the blast
killed a 2-year-old boy who had been riding in a car with his father
and mother, a surgeon and a nurse, when the blast occurred.
   Corcuera said the mother, who was reported in very critical
condition, could be pregnant.
   He said about 45 people suffered injuries and that most had been
treated for cuts and bruises and released. He said about 10 people
still were hospitalized in critical condition.
   The minister said the occupants of the van parked it on the
sidewalk and immediately ran towards another waiting vehicle that
drove away. The van exploded shortly afterwards.
   The getaway vehicle was located a short time later in a nearby
park, where police destroyed it as a precaution.
   A Civil Guard spokesman said 141 Civil Guards lived in the
barracks.
   Witnesses reported nearby buildings were heavily damaged,
including a convent and a restaurant. Callers throughout Madrid told
radio stations they heard the blast.
   No one immediately took responsibility, but suspicion fell on the
militant separatist organization ETA, the acronym for ``Homeland and
Liberty'' in the Basque language.
   Police in Bilbao in northern Spain said an explosion at a French
auto dealership happened about an hour before the Madrid blast,
causing extensive damage but no injuries.
   Officials said they believed the Madrid explosion was caused by a
car bomb filled with explosives parked near a dormitory for Civil
Guard cadets.
   The ETA exploded a car bomb at the same building in May 1987,
killing a woman passer-by.
   The organization has claimed at least 600 victims, many of them
Civil Guards, in its 20-year campaign to gain independence for the
three-province northern Spanish Basque country.
   On Nov. 2, the ETA offered to stop attacks for 60 days if the
government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez agreed to begin
discussions in Algeria over the future of the Basque country.
   Gonzalez dismissed the offer as a ``macabre ploy.'' The offer was
made three days after the ETA released a businessman held hostage
for 248 days.
   Gonzalez and President Francois Mitterrand of France were to meet
Wednesday at an annual Franco-Spanish summit in Montpellier, France.
Ways of dealing with ETA terrorism was one item on their agenda.
   So far this year ETA has claimed responsibility for 14 deaths.
   On Dec. 11, a car bomb set by ETA at a Civil Guard barracks in
Zaragoza killed 11 people, including five children. In June 1987,
ETA exploded a car bomb in a Barcelona supermarket that killed 21
people, all of them civilians.
