   Basque political leaders on Sunday
called for an independent state as thousands marked the national
day of the violence-torn region.
   Police said more than 20,000 people attended rallies held by the
northern three-province region's four main nationalist parties,
which hold 53 of 75 seats in the regional parliament.
   ``These are manifestations of a single reality _ our will to be
a nation and to decide our fate by ourselves,'' said regional
parliament leader Jose Antonio Ardanza in San Sebastian. The
rallies commemorated Aberri Eguna, which translates from the
ancient Basque language as Day Of The Basque Motherland.
   More than 10,000 people sang the Basque national anthem and
chanted pro-independence slogans at a march in Pamplona, capital of
the neighboring region of Navarre. Some nationalists want Navarre
to be part of any future Basque state.
   Ardanza, addressing a rally in San Sebastian attended by
thousands of members of his Basque Nationalist Party, criticized
his Socialist coalition partners for failing to support a
pro-independence proclamation signed Feb. 15 by the his party and
three others.
   Another proclamation in 1987 denounced terrorism. The only
regional party that refused to sign the terrorism proclamation was
the Herri Batasuna, widely considered the political arm of the
armed separatist group ETA. ETA has claimed responsibility for
nearly all of the more than 600 killings in political violence in
22 years.
   Under Spain's 1978 constitution, the three Basque provinces,
which have more than 2.1 million inhabitants, form one of the
countries 17 ``autonomous communities.'' But their true autonomy is
limited since they are dependent on the Madrid government for
nearly all their funds and lack formal representation in a national
legislative body.
