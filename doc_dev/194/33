TWO CAR bombs in central Madrid yesterday, which killed seven people and
injured 25, bore the hallmarks of the Basque separatist group, Eta, which
was previously believed to have been cornered and disarmed.
Eta received a setback in general elections this month when its political
front organisation, Herri Batasuna, lost two of the four seats it had held
in parliament.
The group could have been seeking to put pressure on the Basque Nationalist
party, PNV - the main political group in the northern Basque region, which
is this week considering an invitation issued by prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez to join a coalition government.
The car bombs exploded during the morning rush hour four blocks and 45
minutes apart. The first killed five senior military officers, a sergeant
and a civilian driver who were travelling in an unmarked minibus to general
staff headquarters. The second blast severely injured several pedestrians
close to the US embassy and the residence of the French ambassador.
The explosions were the first in Madrid in a year, and came at a time when
Eta activity had been low. Several gunmen have been detained recently and
the organisation's commander, arrested in France last year, was jailed for
10 years by a Paris court last Friday.
