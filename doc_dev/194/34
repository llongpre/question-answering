   Three suspected Basque separatists shot and
killed a paramilitary civil guard Wednesday and fled in a stolen
car.
   Bomb experts in Madrid, meanwhile, defused a letter bomb sent to
Justice Minister Enrique Mugica, ministry sources said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attacks. But police said
they bore the earmarks of the Basque separatist organization ETA,
which has renewed attacks on government targets after a breakdown
in peace talks with the government of Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
   The Vizcaya province civil governor's office said two men and a
woman gunned down Jose Calvo de la Hoz, 51, on a street in the
northern city of Guecho, eight miles from Bilbao. He died an hour
later of head wounds.
   The getaway car was not immediately located, but police found
its owner in Lejona, where the assailants handcuffed him and left
him tied to a tree.
   ETA, an acronym for homeland and liberty in the Basque language,
has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mostly
military and police officers, in its 21-year campaign for
self-determination for Spain's three-province northern Basque
region.
   The group halted its attacks in January in return for peace
talks with the government. ETA ended the moratorium on April 4,
however, and renewed the bomb attacks. On Monday, the government
called off the talks.
   ``We will use all means at our disposal to battle this
phenomenon,'' Gonzalez, referring to ETA, told Spanish National
Radio.
   ETA sent a statement early Wednesday to the Basque daily Egin in
which it claimed responsibility for five package-bombs sent since
Friday to Spanish officials and military targets.
   It also took responsibility for eight bombs set off Saturday on
a rail line linking the Basque region's capital, Vitoria, with
neighboring Navarre. The bombs caused heavy damage but no injuries.
   ETA said it planned to set off bombs on the Madrid-Seville and
Madrid-Valencia rail lines between midnight Thursday and midnight
Saturday.
   An ETA package-bomb exploded Monday at a military training
school in the Pyrenees mountains of northern Spain, seriously
injuring a sergeant. Another blew up Friday in an apartment in the
Basque town of Irun, injuring a high school gym teacher who lost
part of one arm and the fingers of a hand.
   Authorities defused three package bombs sent to government and
military officials on Monday and Tuesday.
