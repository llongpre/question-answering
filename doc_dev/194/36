<HEAD>Basque Separatists Claim Bombing Deaths of Policeman, Civil Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Basque separatist group ETA claimed
responsibility today for the bombing deaths last week of a Basque
policeman and a paramilitary Civil Guard.
   In a statement sent to local papers, ETA said it had planted a
bomb that exploded in a train tunnel early Sunday in Legazpi, near
the Basque city of San Sebastian, instantly killing Jose Juan
Pacheco Cano, 26.
   Pacheco Cano, a member of the autonomous Basque region's police
unit, the Ertzantza, had joined in a search for bombs after a local
travel bureau received a warning that explosives had been planted
in the area.
   In the second attack, a car bomb exploded late Sunday as a unit
of the paramilitary Civil Guard passed by near the Pamplona,
Navarre, city jail. The driver, Julio Gangoso, 31, was killed and
seven others were injured.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque country and annexation of the neighboring Navarre
region.
   Since beginning its violent campaign for independence in 1968,
ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people,
mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers.
   So far this year ETA has claimed 13 killings, including that of
Pacheco Cano, the first officer of the autonomous Basque region's
police unit to die in an ETA attack.
   In its note ETA called the latter's death ``an accident.''
