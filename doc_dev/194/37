   A 2-year-old boy died today of a shrapnel
wound to the head from a car bomb that ripped through the national
headquarters of the paramilitary Civil Guard, officials said. He was
the second fatality.
   The explosives-packed van was detonated just before midnight
Tuesday. It instantly killed a 38-year-old Madrid man who was
driving nearby and injured 44 people, nine critically, police said.
   Nine of the 141 Civil Guards living in the headquarters were
slightly injured, police and hospital officials said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Interior
Ministry spokesmen said today that the attack bore the earmarks of
ETA, the Basque separatist organization.
   Luis Delgado Villalonga, 2, died this morning after eight hours
of treatment, said a spokesman for Clinico Hospital. The child was
hit by shrapnel while he was riding in a car with his parents, who
remained in critical condition with severe head injuries,
authorities said.
   Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera told reporters the bombers
parked an explosives-packed van on the sidewalk next to the
building, then ran to a stolen getaway car and apparently triggered
the blast seconds later by remote control. Police located the stolen
getaway car about two hours later, and exploded it as a precaution.
   The explosion tore a hole 15 feet in diameter through one wall of
the three-story headquarters, collapsing several ceilings. It
heavily damaged nearby buildings, including a convent and apartments
across from it, and shattered most windows within half a mile.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said the van was loaded with about
200 pounds of explosives and a large amoung of shrapnel and
destroyed more than 20 cars. It could be heard across the capital of
4 million residents.
   About the same time as Tuesday's explosion, suspected Basque
separatists set off three bombs in and near the northern Basque city
of Bilbao, seriously damaging three French car dealerships but
causing no injuries, police said.
   ETA has claimed at least 600 victims, many of them Civil Guards,
in its 20-year campaign to gain independence for the three-province
northern Spanish Basque country.
   So far this year, ETA has claimed responsibility for attacks
killing 14 people.
   ETA claimed responsibility for a similar car bomb attack on the
same Civil Guard building in May 1987 that killed a woman passerby.
   Last month, it offered to stop attacks for 60 days if the
government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez would begin discussions
in Algeria on the future of the Basque region.
   Gonzalez rejected the Nov. 2 offer, which came three days after
ETA released a hostage. The Basque group held the businessman for
248 days after his family paid an estimated $10 million ransom.
