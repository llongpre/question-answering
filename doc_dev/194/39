   The moderate Basque Nationalist Party was
the top finisher in regional elections, according to results
announced today. The outcome was seen as a rejection of a radical
independence movement.
   The Basque Nationalists won 22 seats in the 75-member regional
parliament. The Socialists, their governing partners for the past
four years, won 16 seats.
   Between them, the two parties have 38 seats, enough for a
one-seat majority. Previously, the Socialists had the larger bloc
of seats in the coalition.
   The Herri Batasuna or Popular Union party, widely considered the
political arm of the Basque nationalist terrorist group ETA,
finished with 13 seats, the same number it had already held.
   Several Basque newspaper editorials called the results a vote of
confidence for the current coalition government and an endorsement
of the strategy of seeking greater autonomy but not independence
from Madrid.
   There were no reports of political violence during Sunday's
voting in the northern three-province region. All the parties
except Herri Batasuna formally renounced violence in 1987.
   During the campaign, the Basque Nationalists and Socialists both
stressed political stability and economic recovery over the
autonomy issue.
   In Sunday's voting, the Basque Nationalists gained five seats
over their share from the last regional elections in 1986, while
the Socialists lost three seats.
   In other results, the conservative Popular Party, the chief
opposition party in the national parliament, won six seats, gaining
four. The conservative Union Alavesa, formed recently from
nationalists within the Popular Party, won three seats.
   The biggest losers were two leftist nationalist parties. Eusko
Alkartasuna lost four seats to finish with nine, and Euskadiko
Ezkerra's share dropped from nine to six seats.
   The Madrid-based Democratic and Social Center party, led by
former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez, virtually disappeared from the
political map. The party, which won two seats in the 1986 election,
garnered less than 1 percent of the vote and failed to win a single
seat.
   Officials said 61 percent of the 1.8 million registered voters
cast ballots.
