<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arzalluz Calls For Independent Basque </F>
Country"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] Chairman 
Xabier Arzalluz stated yesterday that he wants independence for 
the Basque Country, although he does "not expect to see it." 
  In statements made to the Spanish Radio Broadcasting Company 
network, the PNV's top leader said that the Basque people could 
win this independence if they wished, "but I am a Basque 
nationalist, and there are people here -- in the Basque Country 
-- who are not nationalists, and what I believe is that what we 
win should be won by a clear majority." 
  Arzalluz showed himself in favor of a "Basque state within 
Europe," although he admitted that this is impossible right now, 
because there is the Army, which guarantees "that there will be 
no dismemberment of what is called national territory." 
  He referred to Article 8 of the Constitution, which assigns 
to the Armed Forces the task of guaranteeing Spain's sovereignty 
and independence and defending its territorial integrity and 
constitutional order, maintaining that it "is unpresentable." 
  In his opinion, the reactions to his speech on Aberri Eguna 
[Basque Fatherland Day] last Sunday, in which he criticized this 
article and described Spain's unity as "a story," are due not to 
a misinterpretation but to a manipulation, and added that the 
Basque people "have no chance of deciding freely." 
<H5>  Resignation </H5>
  Xabier Arzalluz said that civil governor of Vizcaya Daniel 
Arranz should resign for linking his Aberri Eguna statements 
with Monday's attack, and stated that following the things that 
were said, there was a need for a clarification by Interior 
Minister Antoni Asuncion along the lines of the one made 
Tuesday, which dissociated Arzalluz and the PNV from the 
strategy of Basque Homeland and Liberty. 
  "Asuncion is an intelligent man and knows what is at issue, 
but 24 hours elapsed before Asuncion spoke, and very grave 
things were said here, and the matter of Article 8 of the 
Constitution is the least of it," he said. 
  The nationalist leader said that the harsh reaction by the 
PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to his Aberri Eguna 
speech did not surprise him, and added that Ramon Jauregui and 
Mario Onaindia began the argument with its partners in the 
Basque government. 
  "We are now arguing with the PSOE, but the grave argument 
was 
begun systematically by Mr. Jauregui, backed by Mr. Onaindia; it 
is they who have led us to this situation." 
  In this connection, he added that Ramon Jauregui, 
"accompanied by Mr. Onaindia, is the man who is stirring up 
many things here because of his obsession with the elections." 
He also criticized the Basque Socialists for acting in 
accordance with Madrid's instructions. "What they do comes by 
fax from Madrid. They govern from there to here," he said. 
  The PNV chairman stated that the Socialists have already 
begun the Basque election campaign, and forecast that there will 
be no major changes: "It can be taken as an article of faith," 
he stated, "that the PNV will rise, Jauregui -- the Basque 
Socialists' secretary general -- will fall, and the People's 
Party will rise." 
  He acknowledged that the future Basque government was not 
discussed during his recent meeting with People's Party Chairman 
Jose Maria Aznar. 
  "If the government partner here -- the PSOE -- is presuming 
that it can talk with everybody," he said, "and holds talks with 
Eusko Alkartasuna [Basque Solidarity] or with Mayor Oreja -- 
leader of the People's Party in the Basque Country -- which are 
overt, moreover, saying that there can be many formulas, and 
covertly even with Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party], you 
will understand that we also feel free to talk openly with 
anybody." [passage omitted]
