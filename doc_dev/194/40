<F P=106> [Article by Victor Cardoso] </F>
  [Text] Jon Imanol Azua Mendia, government vice president of 
the autonomous Basque country, confirmed that no known member of 
the separatist organization ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] 
is in Mexico; that there is no known link with local subversive 
groups; and that the Mexican Government has never asked for 
special advisers to combat terrorist activities. 
  In a news conference at the conclusion of his eight-day 
official visit to Mexico, the representative of the Basque 
Government stated there is no information, proof, or indication 
that the ETA had anything to do with the events that shook 
Mexico this year. "If any known member of the ETA were in 
Mexico, he would have been identified and completely controlled. 
We have to admit, however, that clandestine organizations also 
have unidentified leaders, but they are always tracked down," he 
said. 
  He explained that the Mexican authorities and police 
exchange 
data with their counterparts in Spain and the Basque country, 
which he considered normal and based on signed agreements. He 
added that no specific action had been requested by the Mexican 
Government. 
  Azua Mendia condemned violence and said dialogue is the best 
path for finding solutions to any kind of problem. "There is no 
place in any country for violence or the use of violent methods 
because such things are insane and distort the main goals of any 
struggle," he expressed. 
  Well versed in Mexican affairs as he has lived here for 
several years, Azua Mendia made light of newspaper reports 
implicating former Government Secretary Fernando Gutierrez 
Barrios in illegal activities. He denied that Spanish media are 
waging a campaign to discredit either Mexico or its politicians. 
"I do not agree with the opinions expressed by much of the 
media, although one could surmise that they are looking for the 
reasons behind the events in the country. Nevertheless, they are 
still nothing more than newspaper articles," he said. 
  "In general, there is confidence and a positive impression 
of 
Mexico abroad. Events throughout the year could have initially 
shaken the confidence of the international community, but the 
country's opening process, the signing of the free trade 
agreement, and Mexico's recent inclusion in the OECD are proof 
that this process is irreversible. All of these factors 
increase confidence that Mexico is a sure bet for the future," 
Azua added. 
  Remarking on his visit, Azua Mendia said an agreement was 
reached with Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe to operate a Basque 
financial institution once the secretariat establishes the norms 
for foreign bank operations in Mexico. Azua also spoke with 
Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello, with whom he discussed relations 
between Spain and Mexico, particularly trade and the 
possibilities for foreign investment raised by NAFTA.
