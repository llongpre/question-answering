<HEAD>Thousands March For Government Negotiations With ETA</HEAD>

   Thousands marched in a cold, heavy rain
through the center of this restive northern city Saturday, demanding
the government open talks with the Basque separatist group ETA.
   The march, which authorities said drew an estimated 18,000
people, was organized by the radical Basque nationalist party Herri
Batasuna, widely considered the political arm of ETA.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for more than 600 deaths since
1968, when it began fighting for independence for the three-province
northern Basque region.
   The demonstrators carried a wide banner bearing the phrase ``for
the negotiation toward peace'' and shouted slogans in favor of ETA
and for negotiations.
   The march was peaceful and guarded by national police, said Julio
Ignacio Campuzano, a spokesman of the Vizcaya province civil
governor's office.
   ETA, an acronym for Basque land and liberty in the Basque
language, declared Jan. 8 it would stop attacks for 15 days to press
the government to enter negotiations on the future of the Basque
region.
   But the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
has asked ETA for an indefinite ``cease-fire'' as a condition for
resuming talks cut off a year ago after an ETA attack, according to
a report published in the leading Madrid daily El Pais.
   El Pais, citing government sources, reported Jan. 15 the talks
were to be resumed in Algeria where Eugenio ``Antxon'' Etxebeste and
other leaders of the organization are exiled.
