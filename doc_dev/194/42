<HEAD>Suspected Basque Separatists Kill Man In Restauant</HEAD>

   A gunman killed a restaurant worker today
as he served coffee to customers, and police blamed the attack on
Basque separatists.
   The gunman fled in a car after shooting Jose Luis Barrios in the
San Jorge Restaurant, police said. The 34-year-old, whose father
owns the restaurant, was the only person hurt in the attack at 1
a.m.
   An anonymous caller who said he spoke for the Basque separatist
organization ETA told a traveler's bureau in Santurce that a man
whose car had been stolen was tied to a tree in the nearby town of
Baracaldo.
   Police later located the man who said two men had stolen his car
at gunpoint at 10 p.m. Friday. Police were checking to determine if
the stolen car was used by the gunman who carried out the killing.
   Police did not know why the attacker singled out Barrios or the
San Jorge Restaurant, which is owned by Prospero Barrios, a former
Socialist city councilman in Santurce.
   The caller did not claim responsibility for the killing on
behalf of ETA, which seeks independence from Spain for the
three-province northern Basque region. Since taking up arms in
1968, ETA has taken responsibility for killing 600 people, mainly
police, military and paramilitary Civil Guard officers.
   So far this year, ETA has claimed responsibility for attacks
that have killed 10 people in the Basque country, including a
discotheque owner and a restaurant owner who ETA said were involved
in drug trafficking.
