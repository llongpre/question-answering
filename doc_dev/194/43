<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the Basque </F>
autonomous government, by Jose Luis Barberia; place and date not 
given: "Jose Antonio Ardanza"] 
  [Text] San Sebastian--The question whether the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party] has substantially modified its "line" has 
reemerged in conjunction with all the furor stirred up in recent 
weeks by combative public statements from party spokespersons. 
  [Barberia] What's happened to make your party, the PNV, 
harden its line lately? 
  [Ardanza] My party has not changed its line, but after seven 
years in which not a single statutory transfer [to the regional 
autonomous government] was implemented, we are really tired of 
waiting, and we find it intolerable that the socialist party 
continues tinkering endlessly with obligatory, mandated 
legislation such as the Statute of Guernica, which was endorsed 
in a referendum. 
  [Barberia] Isn't it true that the underlying basis of all 
the 
polemics is the breakdown of negotiations on the general budget 
bill and PNV's participation in the Madrid government? 
  [Ardanza] After seven years it seemed only reasonable that 
the PNV should get rapid progress on autonomy, at a time when it 
was being asked to make larger commitments and was even offered 
the possibility of participation in a hypothetical coalition 
government. But the socialists' response was to say there would 
be no movement on autonomy legislation until the PNV promises 
this will be the last demand. In other words, they want us to 
renounce our nationalist ideology, to yield to their cynical 
attempts at blackmail. 
  [Barberia] More than the issue of suspended transfers per 
se, 
what the central government and the PSOE [Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party] seem to reject is the PNV's interpretation of 
some of these reforms. 
  [Ardanza] During those seven years, we told the socialists 
again and again that we were prepared, on these pending matters, 
to accept the interpretations they themselves made back in 1979, 
when they asked the Basque people to vote for the law. The 
response, equally cynical, has been that that interpretation is 
obsolete. Under the circumstances, it seems to me the PNV has 
shown ample restraint and moderation. 
  [Barberia] As the highest official in the [Basque] 
autonomous 
community, do you think it proper and politically prudent to 
say, as spokesmen for your party have been quoted recently, that 
the king should not rely on bayonets alone, that the monarch 
gave a "humorous" talk, that the army is an obstacle to 
self-determination, and that the Civil Guard is a loathsome 
apparatus? 
  [Ardanza] Look, I'm not going to get into making specific 
judgments about what people have said or not said. What 
surprises me is the scandal people are trying to make of it. 
What is scandalous in my own opinion is that the Civil Guard 
have set up humiliating roadblocks everywhere, that they 
mistreat a mayor in full view of his own townspeople, throw him 
down on the ground, kick him and hold him with his arms crossed 
for two full hours. There comes a time when you have to say: 
"This has got to stop." I'm not going to deny that some people, 
myself included, may have spoken too harshly on occasion; what 
surprises me, though, is that they should spend an hour in a 
press conference denouncing what after all was only a single 
sentence. 
  [Barberia] And what do you have to say about the debate on 
self-determination, all the references to the Ulster accord? 
  [Ardanza] We weren't the ones to raise that issue. We have 
other priorities, other urgent issues, such as progress on 
autonomy and above all recession and unemployment. But what 
happens? Well, we are constantly raked over the coals and 
besieged with demands to take a position on that issue. And we 
are Basque nationalists! For us, self-determination is a 
legitimate right, recognized by international bodies. So why is 
it so scandalous? Why is it that this and other subjects are 
considered taboo here in Spain? Is it because Spain's democracy 
is not fully established and normalized? Truly, one begins to 
have doubts, when all it takes to stir up an immediate scandal 
is to say something about the army. 
  [Barberia] Do you think these polemics are artificial--in 
other words, that there's an element of hypocrisy here? 
  [Ardanza] What I believe is this: There are lots of 
conjuring 
tricks going on here, since at the same time both of Spain's 
largest political parties have lost their ideological moorings, 
or so it seems. In the last analysis, one has the impression 
that the socialist party is just a machine that exists to 
perpetuate itself in government and parcel out power. The crisis 
in the PSOE today--and it is one of the state's biggest 
problems--has nothing to do with ideology: It's all about the 
allocation and control of power. 
  [Barberia] As the description of a political party, that's a 
fairly harsh judgment.... 
  [Ardanza] They vacillate between frontal opposition and 
compromise, depending--as far as I can tell--on changes in the 
opinion polls. I'm not saying it's not legitimate, but I think 
that's how it is. 
  [Barberia] Is there any justification for the comparisons 
being made between the "Irish case" and the so-called Basque 
problem? 
  [Ardanza] All I can say is, it's worth reflecting on the 
method chosen by the governments of two democratic countries, 
the United Kingdom and Ireland, to deal with a political 
conflict that has lasted more than 70 years. They signed a 
document in which they acknowledged that the road to peace is 
based on the right of the inhabitants of Ulster to 
self-determination. And this I know: No one there was 
scandalized by the proposal that the Ulsterites decide, 
democratically, whether they want to continue as a province of 
the United Kingdom or become a part of the Republic of Ireland. 
Ulster is not in Africa, neither is it a colony; it's in Europe, 
quite close to us. 
  [Barberia] Leaders of your party have alluded to possible 
Civil Guard opposition to deployment of the Ertzaintza [Basque 
Autonomous Police] in Guipuzcoa, while spokesmen for the 
government have said the presence of Ertzaintza will not mean 
reduced deployments of other security forces. Do we have here 
the germ of a new conflict? 
  [Ardanza] No. We continue to rely on the parliamentary 
accords and the agreements signed between the [Interior] 
Ministry and the Basque department of interior. 
  [Barberia] What is your opinion of the personnel shake-ups 
in 
Interior and the changes Asuncion seems to want to introduce in 
the struggle against terrorism? 
  [Ardanza] Asuncion has assured us categorically that nothing 
is changed. We'll just have to wait and see. 
  [Barberia] Not even respecting the PNV's erstwhile contacts 
with ETA-HB [Basque Fatherland and Liberty Group/Herri Batasuna]? 
  [Ardanza] I rely on the minister's own words, when he 
attested to the necessity of our collaboration. But the mistake 
was to formulate a political proposal. The state cannot avoid 
the obligation it has to democratic nationalists to fully 
implement the requisite legislation, which, I repeat, is 
mandatory and was offered to violent extremists in exchange for 
a truce. That is a violation of the Ajuria Enea pact. 
  [Barberia] Do you think the hopes once vested in the 
so-called Azkoiti track have come to naught? Are we sure they 
don't know who's now in charge of the ETA? 
  [Ardanza] I share the impression that ETA no longer has a 
nucleus capable of getting the entire organization to move in a 
particular direction. As to the first question, I cannot speak 
of failures or successes in absolute terms. These are processes 
whose effectiveness can only be determined after the problem is 
overcome. 
  [Barberia] The last elections substantially altered the 
Basque political landscape. Do you view the advances made by 
nonnationalist Basque parties as temporary, or are they 
indicative of a putative withering away of nationalist supremacy? 
  [Ardanza] It's not very scientific to build whole theories 
on 
the results of a handful of electoral races.
