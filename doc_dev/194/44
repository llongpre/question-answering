<HEAD>Retired Officer In Coma After Ambush In Basque Country</HEAD>

   Doctors said a retired naval officer
was in a coma Friday after he was shot in the head and neck during
an attack blamed on Basque separatists.
   Lt. Aureliano Rodriguez, 65, was shot Thursday by two men
outside his home in this northern Basque city. Police suspect the
attackers belong to the armed Basque separatist group ETA, Spanish
National Radio said.
   Rodriguez suffered brain damage and remained in ``very serious''
condition after five hours of surgery, doctors said at San
Sebastian hospital.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people
in its 21-year-old drive for independence of the three-province
Basque region.
   A single ETA member is believed to have mailed four package
bombs this week, including those that seriously wounded a national
court judge Tuesday and an employee at Madrid's main post office
the next day, the daily El Pais said.
   The initials ETA stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language.
