<TEXT>     The Basque separatist group ETA has claimed responsibility for attacks on
Spanish institutions in Italy in recent months.;    Police fanned out across
Spain on Saturday to check railroad tracks. The state railway, RENFE, and the
Interior Ministry suspended rail service on major networks Saturday after ETA
threatened to blow up rail lines on four major routes between Aug. 3 and Aug.
25.;    The threat, the third in as many years, is aimed at throwing Spain's
vital tourism sector into chaos to force the government into negotiations over
independence for the three-province northern Basque country.;    Several hours
after the service suspension Saturday, two small blasts occurred along train
tracks in north central Palencia province and in the province of Toledo along
the southern route into Andalucia. Police said damage was minor.  </TEXT>
