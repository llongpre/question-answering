   Jesus Maria de Leizaola, who headed
the Basque government-in-exile for nearly two decades during the
dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, has died. He was 92.
   A statement by doctors at Guipuzcoa hospital in this Basque
provincial capital said Leizaola died at 11:30 p.m. Thursday, an
hour after he was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment
following a heart attack.
   Leizaola was a member of parliament under the democratic republic
that existed from 1931 to 1939. The Spanish Civil War broke out in
1936 and Franco's nationalist troops were victorious in 1939.
   Leizaola served as Basque justice and culture commissioner during
the war and went into exile in France in 1937.
   He became head the Basque autonomous government-in-exile in 1960.
Franco died in 1975 and Spain became a parliamentary monarchy.
Leizaola returned to Spain in 1979 and symbolically handed over
power of the regional government for northern Basque region.
   Leizaola was born Sept. 7, 1896, in San Sebastian, the Basque
capital.
   Leizaola had predicted before returning to Spain that the
re-establishment of a Basque autonomous government, which occurred
in 1979, would eliminate ETA, the separatist group that has claimed
responsibility for killing more than 600 people since it took up
arms in 1968.
   ``When full autonomy takes effect, ETA will disappear like a
tumor that cures itself spontaneously,'' he said in an interview in
Paris.
   He died as the government and ETA, which stands for Homeland and
Liberty in the Basque language, were holding negotiations in Algeria
to end the killing and two days before hundreds of thousands were
expected to march in the biggest peace demonstration in Basque
country's history.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.
