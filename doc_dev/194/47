   A statement published in a newspaper
Sunday claimed the Basque separatist organization ETA killed an
army officer in Madrid last week and seriously wounded his driver.
   The officer, Lt. Col. Jose Maria Martinez Moreno, was killed
Friday and his 20-year-old driver, Alfonso de los Reyes, was shot
in the neck by men who attacked their military vehicle at one of
Madrid's busiest intersections.
   The claim of responsibility, in the form of a note, was printed
in Egin, a newspaper in the northern city of San Sebastian.
   The note also claimed ETA responsibility for the slaying of a
man in Bilbao who died Wednesday when a bomb blew up his truck. The
statement claimed that Ignacio Banuelos Laso, 26, was slain because
he was a drug trafficker.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has killed 17 people this year in its 11-year-old
campaign to gain self-determination for the three-province northern
Spanish Basque country.
