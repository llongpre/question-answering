   A bomb believed set by Basque separatists
killed a national police officer today as he started the engine of
his car in Algorta, a town about 20 miles from this northern Basque
city, authorities said.
   Officials of the provincial Bilbao civil governor's office said
the car was parked near the home of the police officer, 49-year-old
Eladio Rodriguez Garcia.
   The officials, who were not identified in keeping with custom,
said they suspected the bomb was planted by members of the Basque
separatist organization ETA, which has been blamed for 15
assassinations in Spain so far this year.
   ETA has killed more than 600 people, mostly military and police
officers since it started a violent campaign for independence of
the three-province Basque country from Spain in 1968.
