   A mail bomb linked to Basque separatists
exploded Friday at a brokerage firm in this Mediterranean port,
killing the manager and injuring five other people, a government
spokesman said.
   Juan Antonio Perez Herrero, 35, died in Valencia General
Hospital nearly six hours after the bomb went off at 12:15 p.m. in
the office of Intermediarios Financieros, according to the
spokesman, Manuel Miralles.
   The package was delivered to the office in this city 185 miles
south of Barcelona by a courier carrier.
   The spokesman said Perez Herrero and the other injured were
rushed to the hospital after the blast, which blew out the windows
of the second-story office.
   Four people were later released after being treatment for cuts
and bruises. The fifth remained in the hospital under observation.
   Although no group immediately claimed reponsibility for the
attack, officials said it bore the hallmarks of the Basque
separatist group ETA. The group has been behind other mail bombs in
recent weeks.
   ETA has staged a campaign of terror since 1968 to win
independence for the three-province northern Spanish Basque
country. ETA's name comes from initials in the Basque language
standing for ``homeland and liberty.''
   Perez Herrero's death brought to seven the number of terrorist
murders in Spain this year. ETA has claimed responsibility for five
of the deaths.
   On April 23, ETA sent two mail bombs to the Department of
Prisons in Madrid. One mangled the hand of an employee, and police
defused the second.
   On April 19, an ETA mail bomb seriously damaged the hand of a
woman working in Seville for Expo '92, the world's fair to be held
in 1992.
