<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PSOE Retorts That People's Party </F>
Believes That `Democracy Is Lottery'"] 
  [Text] After learning of [People's Party (PP) Chairman] 
Aznar's statements demanding an early election, PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] and CiU [Convergence and Union] leaders 
stated yesterday that the two political parties are opposed 
because they deem more important the government's stability in 
order to combat the crisis. The PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] 
was also opposed, while ERC [Republican Left of Catalonia] 
reiterated its demand for Gonzalez' resignation. 
  Juan Pedro Hernandez Molto, PSOE of Castilla-La Mancha 
secretary general and a prominent renewalist leader, said in the 
Congress of Deputies that Aznar's remarks are unfortunate 
statements for the country's general interests. 
  "You cannot present a version of democracy," he added, "as 
if 
it were a lottery in which you gamble until you strike it lucky. 
The public knew that they were voting in elections to the 
European Parliament, and that was their intention and the 
interpretation that must be made."

  Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) Steering Committee 
Chairman Jose Antoni Duran Lleida stated that "we believe that 
the country needs not bringing the election forward but taking 
important decisions, for which we want a strong government." 
  He added that as long as the government is able to 
"guarantee 
stability" and ensures the strengthening of the economic policy 
that is good for the country, UDC is opposed to bringing the 
election forward because "it means leaving the country open and 
without a government for six or seven months." 
  Nevertheless, he warned that if the Socialists do not 
guarantee the necessary stability "or their own internal 
division renders unfeasible the continuation of the economic 
policy, governability would be cut short by the Socialist 
government, and our support would not make sense." 
  For his part, CiU deputy Jordi Casas said that beginning an 
electoral period right now would mean several months with a 
government with little ability to act, and what is needed "is 
the contrary, in order to try to take advantage of the signs of 
economic recovery." 
  He added that what could prove positive is a process of 
bringing closer together all the political forces' stances in 
order to improve the economic situation and create jobs. 
  PNV spokesman in the Congress Inaki Anasagasti was opposed 
to 
calling an early election on the ground that it would "set back" 
the autonomous community elections that should be held in the 
Basque Country in the fall. 
  Anasagasti stated that the possibility of bringing forward 
the election should be considered only if the government "did 
not have sufficient parliamentary support or did not have its 
own party's support." 
  The Basque nationalist leader said that he "understands" the 
strategy adopted by the People's Party following the European 
elections, "because it should take advantage of the impetus 
achieved with the magnificent 12 June results," although he 
asserted that the elections to the European Parliament cannot be 
turned into a general election. 
  Last, ERC deputy Pilar Rabola agreed with the PP chairman in 
asking Felipe Gonzalez to bring forward the election. 
  However, Rabola specified that, "unlike Aznar, we are 
demanding that it be brought forward not in order to govern but 
because Felipe Gonzalez has lost his political credibility amid 
so many corruption scandals."
