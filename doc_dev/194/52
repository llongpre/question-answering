The shadowiest episode of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's tenure of office has returned
10 years later to haunt Spain's prime minister, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
How much did he and his government know about an undercover war fought by
French and Portuguese mercenaries, who styled themselves as GAL, the
Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, against members of Eta, the Basque
separatist organisation, in south west France between 1983, the year after
Mr Gonzalez took power, and 1986?
It was then that the picturesque villages and towns of France's Cote Basque,
just across the border from Spain and long a safe haven zone for Eta
members, were wracked by a shooting and bombing campaign that ended as
abruptly as it had started.
The events are now being relived in a legal investigation that has severely
embarrassed Mr Gonzalez and threatens to rock his government.
Eta was at the time extremely active and the mysterious GAL suddenly
appeared on the scene to carry the separatist violence into France. Every
terrorist action in Spain extracted, within days, its retribution with a
tit-for-tat incident in St Jean-de-Luz, Biarritz, Hendaye and other
locations across the border.
The undercover war ceased when, in a reversal of its previous policy, the
French authorities began to round up Eta suspects and hand them over
directly to Spanish police. Eta continues its violence to this day but the
Cote Basque is no longer its sanctuary.
In all GAL claimed 23 fatal victims, among them several leading Eta members.
Between 1987 and 1988 courts in France and in Portugal brought charges
against more than 20 GAL members some of whom helped to identify Spanish
policemen Mr Jose Amedo and Mr Michel Dominguez, who were then attached to
an intelligence unit in the Basque city of Bilbao.
In 1991 Mr Amedo and Mr Dominguez received long prison terms after a Madrid
court upheld evidence that they had recruited gunmen in mercenary circles
and organised them into the GAL death squad.
The court absolved the administration of any involvement in GAL's sinister
activities and Mr Gonzalez said at the time there 'is no proof and never
will be' incriminating his government.
This week the investigating judge who brought the two policeman to court,
and who decided in September to re-opened the dirty war case, has indicted
and committed to prison the director general of state security between 1984
and 1986 and two former senior counter-terrorism officers on charges that
they created GAL.
Yesterday the respected Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia headlined a report
on its front page saying that the legal probe, conducted by Madrid high
court judge Baltasar Garzon would extend up through the administration
hierarchy to include Mr Jose Barrionuevo, a stalwart of Mr Gonzalez's
Socialist party, who was interior minister between 1982 and 1988.
The government's chief spokesman has said the indictments had 'surprised'
the government but that it would maintain a 'prudent silence' over judge
Garzon's investigations.
Mr Barrionuevo has not remained silent. He has visited Mr Julian
Sancristobal, the former security boss, in prison and in a succession of
statements he has said he stands fully by his former aide and the other
former counter-terrorism chiefs.
In a radio interview Mr Barrionuevo rhetorically asked whether in other
countries that faced a terrorism threat such as that posed by Eta 'people
who fought against that terrorism with considerable personal sacrifice would
be treated as they are here.'
The problem that Mr Barrionuevo, and possibly Mr Gonzalez himself, face is
that if there was a GAL cover-up, it is now, for two reasons, likely to be
blown wide open.
One is that Judge Garzon, Spain's foremost legal celebrity, is a persistent
investigator who is said by his supporters to be 'a man with a mission' and
who is accused of 'wanting to settle scores' by associates of Mr
Barrionuevo.
In 1993 he hung up his judge's toga to run on Mr Gonzalez's ticket in the
general elections and was given a senior job in the interior ministry. Later
judge Garzon resigned his parliamentary seat to resume his legal career
saying the government was not doing enough about corruption.
The other reason is that Mr Amedo and Mr Dominguez, who were transferred to
an open prison in July as part of a partial amnesty package that involved
jailed Eta members, have decided to co-operate fully with judge Garzon
following his decision to resume the investigation into GAL.
The two former policemen were questioned at length last week by the judge
and they were subsequently cross-examined together with Mr Sancristobal and
the other indicted former security chiefs.
Yesterday Judge Garzon, in a further twist to the GAL scandal, ordered the
indefinite release from prison of Mr Amedo and Mr Dominguez, saying he
wished to safeguard their security.
