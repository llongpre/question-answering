FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (5): 'Complicated' recovery
forecast - The Economy

Economically speaking, what is good for Spain is better for the Basque
Country and the reverse is just as true. With the Spanish economy now
entering its second year of recession, the Basque economic indicators look
worse than they do elsewhere in the country.
The third-quarter 1993 report issued by Bilbao's business think tank, the
Circulo de Empresarios Vascos, sombrely notes that there is no sign of any
brakes to arrest the falling industrial demand and, much less, of recession
bottoming out. It concludes that recovery in the Basque Country will be
'more complicated' than in other areas of Spain.
The industrial activity index for the Basque Country in May, the latest
available statistic, fell by 4.7 per cent which was in line with the
negative growth recorded for the past two years and the year-on-year fall in
industrial activity stood at the end of that month at 10.1 per cent.
A breakdown of the Basque Country's recession data gives worrying
statistics. The steel sector, which accounts for 44 per cent of the area's
industrial activity, fell by 10.9 per cent in May to give a 12-month drop of
16.3 per cent. Bilbao's estuary, once the pulsating hub of heavy Spanish
industry, is now an industrial wasteland, arguably darker and more satanic
than anywhere in the developed world.
'Before people used to talk about profits and investments and now when you
get two businessmen together they will swap stories about how they are
reducing their payroll,' says Mr Jose Miguel de la Rica, chairman of the
Circulo think tank. Profits, when they exist at all, are uniformly down and
the investment is ploughed into paying off redundancies.
The labour shakeout is aimed principally at containing losses and not at
improving productivity. Companies are offering early retirement to those
aged 55 and they are sacking those under 30 who are mostly employed under
temporary contracts and are cheaper to dismiss.
Unemployment stood at 23.2 per cent of the Basque Country's active working
population in the second term of this year, according to the Madrid-based
Statistics Institute's labour survey. This figure, which gave a jobless
total for the area of 201,240, was marginally above the national average; it
was a shocking set of data for what was once, scarcely 20 years ago, a full
employment area.
The Basque Country's economy is the victim of deceptive successes in the
past when it used to draw cheap labour from the rest of Spain to transform
steel and to manufacture ships and capital goods for the protected Spanish
market. It caught pneumonia when it was blasted by the cold winds of
competition.
'We were stripped naked when we entered the European Community,' says Mr
Jose Maria Gorordo, a former mayor of Bilbao and now the chief executive of
the city's Chamber of Commerce. 'We would have been better off if we had
been left with our old clothes.'
The Basque Country's problem was that its old clothes, its obsolete heavy
industry built around the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya steel plant, was exactly
what Brussels had no use for.
Cut-backs imposed by Europe were exacerbated by domestic difficulties,
chiefly the over-valued peseta of the 1980s and the high interest rates that
kept the currency high. These factors, coupled to industrial disputes and
soaring wage rises, turned meaningful restructuring and diversification into
an endless obstacle course for the top Basque companies.
Small companies, the area's pride and joy, have scarcely fared better.
Specific sectors, such as car components, are flat and overall they face the
toughest competition possible. 'We are on the frontline of the south-east
Asia challenge,' Mr de la Rica observes with a shrug.
There are examples of the challenge being met. Employees of a local plant
that manufactures sewing machines and was being undercut by a Taiwan rival
were faced with the stark choice of earning less or producing more. They
chose to work a six-day week. A recurring positive theme in all
presentations of the local economy is that the Basques constitute one of the
most industrious labour forces around.
The second asset is the drive of its business community. When a 40-strong
team of Basque entrepreneurs went to Cuba recently one of them travelled
with pots of paint and a fistful of brushes which he personally used to
spruce up a hairpin-producing plant that he had opened a year earlier in
Havana.
'That's the mettle we are made of,' says Mr Marcos Vizcaya, an official of
the ruling PNV party who has known the hairpin manufacturer since childhood.
Such enterprise can, however, stumble over the absence of capitalisation.
Because of terrorism, as well as the often violent industrial relations
environment, foreign investment has mostly given the Basque Country a wide
berth and there has been an equivalent shortage of Spain-based funds.
As a result, capital raising has often to be done within the Basque
community and the Basque Country is fortunate to have in its midst
far-seeing venture backers in the local savings banks and in Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya which has an umbrella industrial holding, the IBV corporation, which
it shares with the electrical utility Iberdrola.
Despite the recession and the internal problems, the presence of such
financial resources means there are a number of brights lights pointing to
an economic future for the Basque Country.
CAF, a railway rolling stock manufacturer that has its main plant in
Beasain, broke even in 1991 after many years of losses and turned in net
profits of Pta1.5bn last year which it put aside for reserves. The company,
which is 25 per cent owned by the three Basque savings banks, currently has
an order book worth Pta77.7bn - 35 per cent of which has been earned outside
Spain.
A second clear example that all is far from lost in the Basque Country is
Gamesa, a Vitoria-based weapons producer that has branched out into new
materials, microelectronics and environmental engineering, now earns 50 per
cent of its revenues outside Spain and is one of the most successful
ventures backed by IBV.
Even in the steel industry, the foundation of the Basque Country's past
wealth, there are companies that have specialised intelligently, have begun
to export aggressively and are making money. The top trio in this
all-important sector are Aristrain which makes long products, Guivart which
produces steel bars, and Tubos Reunidos which manufactures seamless pipes.
It will nevertheless take a while yet before the once finely-tuned engine of
the Basque economy begins to climb into the higher gears.
