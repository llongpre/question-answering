   A bomb believed set off by
Basque separatists exploded Monday night in the path of a bus
carrying police to prison guard duty, killing two officers and
wounding two, officials said.
   The explosion occurred at a crossroads leading to the
Alcala-Meco maximum security prison about 20 miles east of Madrid,
where a number of convicted Basque terrorists are held, said a
spokesman for the Madrid province civil governor's office.
   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that police put up
roadblocks and were hunting for people seen fleeing the blast site
in an automobile.
   It was not immediately known whether a car bomb or some other
kind of device caused the explosion.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but police said the
blast bore the earmarks of ETA, the Basque organization that has
killed more than 600 people in a 21-year campaign to gain
independence for the three-province northern Spanish Basque country.
   ETA is an acronym standing for homeland and liberty in the
Basque language.
   On April 4, ETA called off its moratorium on attacks against
government targets after talks broke down between the ETA and the
Spanish government in Algiers.
   Since then, ETA claimed responsibility for the shooting death
April 12 of a paramilitary Civil Guard officer and of an army
lieutenant April 25.
