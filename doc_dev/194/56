   Paramilitary civil guards killed two members
of the Basque separatist group ETA in a shootout near the French
border and arrested 19 others in an ensuing sweep, the Interior
Ministry announced.
   After the Saturday night shootout, the Ministry said, 19 other
alleged ETA members were arrested in the three-province northeastern
Basque country in a wide police operation. It said police also
seized caches of weapons, grenades and more than 650 pounds of
explosives.
   On Sunday, just hours after the sweep, ETA claimed responsibility
for the Sept. 12 assassination in Madrid of a top female prosecutor.
   In an announcement Sunday, the Interior Minister identified the
two men killed in the previous night's shootout on a highway near
the Basque town of Irun as Juan Oyarbide Aramburu and Manuel
Urionabarrenechea Betanzos.
   It said they were members of the ETA commando unit Araba and were
trying to cross into France in a Madrid-registered truck when civil
guards ordered them to stop and identify themselves.
   Occupants of the truck began shooting and throwing hand grenades
and two were killed by return fire, while three civil guards were
wounded, the ministry said. A third member of the Araba commando
unit, Juan Carlos Arruti Azpitarte, was arrested, along with two
other occupants of the truck, the ministry said.
   Police blame the Araba commando unit for at least six
assasinations and the national head of the civil guard, Luis Roldan,
said the unit may have been responsible for the Sept. 12
assassination of prosecutor Carmen Tagle.
   In a note sent to the San Sebastian newspaper Egin on Sunday, ETA
said its guerrillas shot to death Tagle, 44, who had a reputation as
a tough, anti-terrorist prosecutor and had successsfully prosecuted
many ETA terrorists. Tagle was killed by two men in a car who fired
automatic weapons as she drove into her home garage.
   Since beginning its 21-year campaign of violence for independence
from Spain for the three Basque provinces, ETA has claimed attacks
that have killed more than 600 people, mainly police, military and
civil guard officers.
   So far this year, ETA-claimed attacks have claimed 12 lives.
   More than 550 ETA members are currently jailed in Spanish prisons.
