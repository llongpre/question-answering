   Three youths shot to death two national
policemen and seriously injured a third man today in an attack in
the capital of the Basque region, a government spokesman said.
   The spokesman for the Civil Governor's office of Alava province
said the attack occurred about 1:30 p.m. on a central street while
the policemen questioned two people.
   Police identified the dead as national police officers Francisco
Espina Vargas, 32, of Seville, and Antonio Gomez Osuna, 29, of
Coria del Rio in Seville province.
   The third victim, Luis Vivas, 30, apparently a passer-by, was
shot several times. He was in serious condition in a Vitoria
hospital.
   The three youths opened fired on the policemen, who fired back,
before fleeing, the spokesman said.
   The police officers formed part of a motorcycle-riding unit,
police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but police
suspected commandoes of the Basque separatist organization ETA,
which seeks independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil
Guard officers.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language for Homeland and
Liberty.
   The deaths brought to four the number of killings this year due
to political violence in Spain.
