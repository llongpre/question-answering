   Spanish officials and leaders of the Basque
separatist organization ETA established preliminary contacts in
Algeria Tuesday that could lead to a cease-fire, Spain's national
EFE news agency reported.
   It said the resumption of talks between the government and ETA
leaders living in exile in Algeria might bring an end to 20 years
of violence that has convulsed the three Basque provinces in
northern Spain and spilled over into the rest of the country.
   Last Friday, government spokesman Javier Solana told reporters
Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was willing to resume the
talks, broken off after a Dec. 11 car bombing at a Civil Guard
barracks in Zaragoza that killed 11 people.
   He said the ETA appeared to be respecting a 60-day truce it
offered Jan. 28 in return for a resumption of the talks.
   EFE, citing unnamed Algerian sources, said chief negotiators at
the talks in Algeria were Eugenio Etxebeste, an ETA leader, and
Julen Elgorriaga representing the government.
   The government made no comment on the EFE report. Solana said
last week the news media ``should not expect daily updates'' on the
progress of any future talks.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language that stands for
Homeland and Liberty.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, the group has claimed
responsibility for killing more than 600 people in its campaign for
independence for the Basque area. Most of the victims were police
and military officers.
   Gonzalez acknowledged in August that his government had made
contacts with ETA leaders in Algeria in an attempt to secure a
cease-fire as a basis for future talks.
   The government has said it is prepared to discuss when, where
and how ETA guerrillas will lay down their arms and possible
pardons for jailed ETA members not directly involved in attacks.
   According to various reports, ETA still seeks greater political
autonomy for the Basque region that would include predominantly
Basque parts of neighboring Navarre province.
   The El Pais newspaper said Gonzalez was expected to discuss the
contacts with ETA in his annual state-of-the-nation address to
Parliament Wednesday.
   But it reported government sources said Gonzalez probably would
warn there could be breakdowns during arduous negotiations and no
guarantee of success.
