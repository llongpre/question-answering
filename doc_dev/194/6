<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arzalluz Asserts That Constitution </F>
Enshrines Unity Through Violence"] 
  [Excerpt] San Sebastian -- Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) 
Chairman Xabier Arzalluz stated in a speech delivered during the 
Aberri Eguna [Basque Fatherland Day] celebrations that his party 
will not confine its political demands to the autonomy statute, 
that the PNV claims sovereignty for all the Basque territories, 
and that the Basque Country will "gradually" achieve a 
"cultural, economic, and ultimately political unity in Europe," 
as well as asserting that the Constitution entrusts the defense 
of Spain's unity to the Army and violence. 
  The PNV, as it has done for the past few years, organized 
two 
different political meetings on the occasion of Aberri Eguna -- 
one in Guipuzcoa in the morning and the second in Bilbao in the 
afternoon. Lehendakari [Basque premier] Jose Antonio Ardanza, 
PNV spokesman Joseba Egibar, and candidate in the European 
elections Josu Jon Imaz spoke at the first meeting, in Azpeitia. 
Aberri Eguna was held this year under the watchword "Let's 
improve the Basque Country." 
<H5>  Ability To Decide </H5>
  In statements made both before the political meeting and 
during his speech before PNV members, the PNV leader was highly 
critical of the Socialists. "Since the agreements in Madrid 
began, they have forgotten everything; they have forgotten the 
right of self-determination. They have never been Basque 
nationalists. The ministers, such as Mr. Eguiagaray, speak of 
the nation's government. Clearly, they believe in another 
nation, in another fatherland." 
  Arzalluz stated that the PNV "wants the Basque people to 
have 
the ability to determine their destiny: If they want it to be 
with Spain, then with Spain; if they want it to be with Europe, 
then with Europe; and if they want it to be on their own, then 
on their own," because "a nation that wishes to hold people down 
through coercion will be not a nation but a prison." "Let them 
not come and tell us," he added "that anything can be upheld 
without violence, because then it turns out that when we uphold 
something that comes from our own freedom, everybody attacks 
us." The PNV leader added that the PNV does not have recourse 
to violence: "We simply demand our right to think, to feel, and 
to secure democratically everything that we see fit." 
  Xabier Arzalluz stated that the political activity of the 
PNV, which claims sovereignty for all the Basque territories, is 
not confined to the statute. "While the statute is important, 
we will not stop there," he stated. "They talk a great deal 
about ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty], they have Article 8 of 
the Constitution, specifically designed for reds and 
separatists, in which they entrust the unity of the fatherland, 
of their idea of a territorial fatherland, to the Army, weapons, 
and violence." According to Arzalluz, when the PNV upholds "what 
comes from what we want and our own freedom, everybody attacks 
us, because they have another fatherland." [passage omitted]
