   Basque separatists have ended a
three-month truce and will renew their campaign of violence, a
Basque newspaper said.
   The Basque group ETA ceased its attacks Jan. 8 in return for
talks with the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez. The group is seeking greater autonomy for the
three-province Basque region in northern Spain.
   On Tuesday, the radical Basque daily Egin said it received an
announcement from ETA blaming the government for forcing it to call
off its ``unilateral cease-fire.'' ETA said the government had
``not maintained its commitments'' to agreements reached during
talks held in Algiers on March 22.
   ETA maintains these agreements include the start of new talks
and the inclusion in the talks of three jailed ETA members and
Basque sympathizers.
   But the group repeated its willingness to resume negotiations if
the government respects agreements already reached, the newspaper
reported.
   For the first time since 1968, when ETA began its campaign of
violence, there have been no deaths from attacks this year. More
than 600 people have been slain during the 21-year-old insurgency.
