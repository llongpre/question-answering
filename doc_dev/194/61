   Unidentified assailants killed an army
colonel and a major and injured their driver today by spraying their
vehicle with machine-gun fire from another car and a motorcycle,
police said.
   It was the first political assassination in Spain since May and
raised to nine the number of people killed in terrorist attacks this
year.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but police said they
suspected the Basque separatist group ETA.
   The attack in Madrid occurred the day after the government of
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez formally ruled out renewing talks
with the ETA aimed at bringing an end to political violence that has
plagued Spain for 21 years.
   A police spokesman said the attack occurred at 11:15 a.m. near
the Spanish army's Madrid regional headquarters.
   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Col. Jose Maria
Martinez Narillo and Maj. Ignacio Varaguas were killed instantly in
the attack.
   Earlier, the spokesman erroneously reported that the driver, Cpl.
Fernando Vilches Herran, had also been killed.
   But a spokeswoman at Maranon Hospital said the soldier remained
in very serious condition with a bullet wound to the spine.
   ETA, the initials for the words Basque Land and Liberty in the
Basque language, seeks independence from Spain for the
three-province northern Basque region. It has claimed responsibility
for killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil
Guard officers since 1968.
