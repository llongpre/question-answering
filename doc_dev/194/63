Security chiefs in the Basque Country yesterday claimed that they had dealt
a significant blow against the Eta separatist group after a succession of
detentions and the discovery of urban hideouts and arms caches. However, the
violent response by Eta supporters, who rioted in protest, served to dash
hopes for peace in the Basque country. The events, which centred on Bilbao,
followed the arrest last in week in Toulon, south France, of Mr Felix Lopez
de la Calle who was allegedly in charge of Eta's active service units. The
apparent response by Eta to the Toulon arrest was an attempt to murder an
army sergeant in Bilbao. This attack failed when the sergeant opened fire
against three Eta members and the latter were later involved in a shootout
with members of the security forces who killed one separatist, wounded a
second and captured the third.
