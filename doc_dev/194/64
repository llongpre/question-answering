   Suspected Basque separatists started a gun
fight with security forces who stopped them Saturday at a toll booth
near this northern town, authorities reported. They said two people
were killed and three were wounded.
   A Civil Guard spokesman said the gun battle occurred on Highway
A-8 when Civil Guards told the occupants of a truck with Madrid
license plates to identify themselves.
   Two men in the truck, believed to be members of the Basque
separatist group known as ETA, began shooting and were killed by
return fire, according to the spokesman.
   He said three Civil Guards were wounded.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region. Irun is in the Basque area.
   Since beginning its violent campaign for independence 21 years
ago, ETA has asserted responsility for attacks that have killed more
than 600 people. Most of the victims have been police, military and
Civil Guard officers.
   Saturday's shooting occurred four days after suspected Basque
separatists in Madrid assassinated Carmen Tagle, a prosecutor of the
national court that handles terrorism cases.
   The same day a mail bomb believed planted by Basque separatists
exploded and killed a fish stand owner at his home in the northern
Basque city of Bilbao.
