<F P=106> [Interview with Spanish Interior Minister Antonio Asuncion </F>
by Isabel San Sebastian in Madrid; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [San Sebastian] Following 
the latest killing perpetrated in Barcelona, to what can the 
failures in the previous attempts be attributed? To chance and 
luck or to the weakness and disorganization of what is left of 
the gang [Basque Homeland and Liberty -- ETA]? 
  [Asuncion] I have my own opinions, and there are opinions to 
suit all tastes. The important thing is that they failed in 
those attacks. 
  [San Sebastian] It is also important to know why... 
  [Asuncion] I believe that they are not very familiar with 
the explosives which they are using, but you will forgive me for 
not entering into technical explanations. 
  [San Sebastian] You stated on your arrival at the ministry 
that you considered the contacts with ETA closed. If the 
"Azkoiti way" was, as was said from this ministry, a police way 
of finding out what was happening inside the gang and creating 
splits, why was it abandoned? 
  [Asuncion] I have recognized no legacy of contacts with ETA 
from Algiers. As far as Azkoiti is concerned, he is an ETA 
member who served his sentence in France and who, according to 
my information, is in favor of renouncing violence, like many 
other prisoners, and is trying to persuade the armed gang to 
renounce violence. But that is no police way; it is the same 
thing that is happening with groups such as Elkarri, which 
belongs to the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party] milieu, and 
which is beginning to say that violence is not the way. 
  [San Sebastian] I will put it to you another way. Since 
your arrival at the ministry, has this ministry any way of 
knowing what is happening inside ETA? 
  [Asuncion] This ministry knows what may be happening within 
a gang of mafiosi, drug traffickers, or criminals through 
informers, about whom, as is natural, I will not say a word. 
  [San Sebastian] If French justice has now granted the 
extradition of Azkoiti, who was the leader of the roving 
commando, and this man no longer counts for anything, why is he 
living peacefully in an apartment in Paris? 
  [Asuncion] I do not know; it is certainly a matter which I 
will have to check. 
  [San Sebastian] Of course. Did the Basque Socialist Party 
[PSE] leaders discuss their initiative of beginning contacts 
with Herri Batasuna? 
  [Asuncion] No, of course not, but in any event these are 
measures which the PSE must discuss within itself. For its 
part, the government must carry out its election program. 
  [San Sebastian] I find it very hard to believe that the PSE 
would embark upon such a venture without the blessing of Ferraz 
Street [Socialist Party headquarters]... 
  [Asuncion] They have embarked upon nothing. They have 
announced that there is a number of ideas worth studying. 
  [San Sebastian] Were you acquainted with that plan? 
  [Asuncion] I became acquainted with it later. 
  [San Sebastian] And what was your opinion? 
  [Asuncion] That the government must stand by what was agreed 
at the Ajuria Enea palace, and that hence that is where that 
plan must be discussed. 
<H5>  Prisoners, Pardons </H5>
  [San Sebastian] Honestly and, if possible, with a date, for 
how long will the prisoners be negotiable, and for how long will 
you keep the doors of rehabilitation open? 
  [Asuncion] They have not been or ever can be negotiable. 
With respect to serving sentences in full, this will be possible 
when the current legislation is changed. The Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party has that proposal in its election program, and now 
we must wait for parliament to decide -- in March, I believe -- 
on the new penal code. 
  [San Sebastian] Are you personally in favor of this? 
  [Asuncion] I, of course, must carry out my party's programs.
