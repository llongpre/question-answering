   Suspected Basque separatists launched four
grenades at a civil guard barracks in this Basque town, injuring
two guards, police said.
   The attackers, suspected members of the separatist group ETA,
launched the grenades Monday night from a light truck parked in the
vicinity, police said.
   ETA, the initials for the words Basque Land and Liberty in the
Basque language, has claimed responsibility for the deaths of more
than 600 people since it took up arms in 1986 to seek independence
for the three-province northern Spanish Basque country.
