<F P=106> [Luis R. Aizpeolea report: "Fraga Asks Gonzalez for Overall </F>
Pact To Complete Implementation of Autonomy"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The autonomy battle is reaching fever 
pitch again. While Catalonia and the Basque Country are in 
favor of developing a bilateral relationship with the central 
government, other communities are aiming at an overall agreement 
in order to complete the implementation of autonomy. Galician 
government Premier Manuel Fraga (People's Party) proposed the 
latter option -- a national pact with the participation of all 
the communities -- to Felipe Gonzalez at the Moncloa Palace 
yesterday. 
  Fraga's stance is similar to that of Socialist Manuel 
Chaves, 
the Andalusia premier, who a week ago criticized the boost to 
autonomy in some communities, referring to Catalonia and the 
Basque Country, and proposed to Felipe Gonzalez that the 
implementation of autonomy be completed in a balanced manner for 
all regions. Gonzalez has shown himself receptive to these 
proposals, according to what Fraga stated yesterday, following a 
meeting lasting over an hour with the prime minister. 
  The similar proposals made by the Galician and Andalusian 
premiers assume major political importance by being put forward 
after the central government offered the Basque government a 
package of 20 transfers [of areas of responsibility] and on the 
eve of Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] Premier Jordi 
Pujol's meeting with Felipe Gonzalez in order to secure a 
breakthrough in autonomy for Catalonia. 
  Both the Catalan Generalitat and the Basque government want 
to maintain bilateral relations with the state, but the Galician 
premier, in harmony with the stance upheld by Chaves a week ago, 
showed his rejection of that course yesterday. "We do not 
believe in a bilateral negotiation between the central 
government and an autonomous government. My administration's 
proposal never casts doubt on the idea that the formulas are 
valid for all the autonomous communities. Now that there is an 
agreement for the `slow track' autonomous communities, as 
enshrined in the 1982 autonomy pacts, and agreement that another 
pact must be reached for the municipalities, this is the time to 
reach a major national agreement in order to complete the 
implementation of autonomy," Fraga said yesterday. 
<H5>  Single Administration </H5>
  The Xunta [Galician autonomous government] premier also 
confirmed that he will send his single administration proposal, 
which will be contained in a white paper, to the prime minister 
and to the premiers of the 17 autonomous communities. 
  Yesterday Fraga demanded from Gonzalez a package of 
transfers 
-- the Social Institute of the Navy, the material resources of 
the administration of justice, vocational training, the National 
Employment Institute, the ports of general interest, and the 
libraries. 
  Gonzalez and Fraga examined the problems of the dairy sector 
in his community. The head of government proposed to Fraga that 
the 10 billion peseta fine for milk surpluses in Galicia during 
the past farming year be renegotiated with the Agriculture 
Ministry and the European Commission. 
  The understanding between Gonzalez and Fraga on an issue 
that 
concerns the government as much as the configuration of the 
state was "tremendously important," according to the Xunta 
premier. Fraga gave Gonzalez a helping hand by stating that he 
finds no power vacuum, in clear contradiction with the 
assertions by the previous day by Rodrigo Rato, his party's 
parliamentary spokesman.
