   Two booby-trapped cars believed set by
Basque separatists have exploded separately, killing one policeman
in this northern city and seriously injuring another in nearby San
Sebastian, police say.
   Both cars exploded just after noon Friday, apparently after
their occupants turned on the ignition, said a police spokesman,
who is customarily not further identified.
   Although no group took responsibility for the attacks a
provincial spokeswoman in San Sebastian, who asked not to be
further identified, said police suspected the Basque separatist
organization ETA.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence for the three-province Spanish Basque
country. Since 1968, it has claimed responsibility for the killings
of more than 650 people to achieve this goal.
   The two car explosions Friday came a day after an ETA gunman
shot and killed a San Sebastian news vendor the organization
accused of being a police informer.
   A caller claiming to speak for ETA told an ambulance service
Thursday the group was responsible for the killing.
   ETA claimed responsibility for the Dec. 10 bombing of a
residence for naval officers in San Sebastian. There were no
injuries reported.
   On Dec. 8, six policemen were killed in the northeastern town of
Sabadell when a car bomb destroyed the van in which they were
riding to a soccer game.
   So far, no group has claimed the attack, but police believe it
is also the work of ETA.
   So far this year, the group has claimed responsibility for 25
killings.
