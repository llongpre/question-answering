<HEAD>Nationalists and Socialists Lead Elections in Basque Region</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VITORIA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of Basque nationalists and
Socialists that has governed the fractious Basque region since 1986
appeared headed for another term, based on early returns from
regional elections Sunday.
   There were no reports of violence, in contrast to three previous
Basque regional elections since the region was given home rule in
1980.
   An exit poll made public by Spanish National Radio and
Television immediately after the polls closed at 8 p.m. gave the
Basque Nationalist Party about 25 percent of the vote, making it
the strongest single political group.
   Based on that popular vote, the Nationalists would gain 21 to 24
seats in the 75-member parliament. That would mark a big increase
over the 17 they had held since the November 1986 election.
   It appeared likely the Nationalists would form a coalition once
again with the Socialists, this time with the Nationalists as
senior partner.
   The Socialists, who run the national government, were projected
to receive 17 percent of the vote and take 15 to 18 seats, down
from the 19 they won in 1986.
   The radical Basque party Herri Batasuna, considered to be the
political arm of the terrorist group ETA, was projected to remain
the third political force in the Basque country with 17 percent of
the vote and 12 to 14 seats.
   Herri Batasuna is the only Basque party that did not subscribe
to a 1987 pact renouncing political violence.
   ETA stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque language. The
group seeks independence for the three-province region. Since 1968,
its attacks have claimed more than 600 lives, including 15 this
year.
   The turnout among the region's 1.7 million eligible voters was
estimated at 54 percent, the lowest in the Basque country since
Spain returned to democracy in 1977.
   Two other nationalist parties, the center-left Eusko
Alkartasuna, and the leftist Euskadiko Ezkerra, were projected to
win 11 and 10 percent of the vote respectively, slightly less than
their totals in the 1986 vote.
   The conservative Popular Party, the main opposition party in the
national parliament, increased its presence from two seats to at
least five, the projection showed.
   Unidad Alavesa, another nationalist group splintered from the
Popular Party, was projected to make its parliamentary debut with
one to three seats.
   The projection, by the Metra-6 polling agency, was based on
interviews with 20,000 voters at 85 voting stations.
