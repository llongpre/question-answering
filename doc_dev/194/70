   Two bombs exploded Thursday outside
banks, causing damage but no injuries, a government official said.
Police suspect the Catalonian separatist group Terra Lliure.
   The Basque separatist group ETA, meanwhile, claimed
responsibility for an Aug. 21 car bomb that killed two civil guards
in the northern town of Estella.
   A Barcelona civil governor's office spokesman said the first
bomb exploded at 3:10 a.m. in the doorway of a Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto) branch office in the suburb of Hospitalet de
Llobregat.
   The blast damaged the building and four nearby cars in the
northeastern city, the official said.
   Less than two hours later, an explosion rocked a downtown Banco
Central office and shattered glass in surrounding buildings, he
said.
   The official said no group claimed the attacks, but the two
bombs were of a type used by Terra Lliure, which seeks independence
for Catalonia and has carried out frequent attacks in Barcelona,
capital of the autonomous region.
   In the Basque country, ETA claimed responsibility for the Aug.
21 car bomb that exploded as two civil guards drove by in their
patrol car, killing them instantly and slightly injuring a woman
and her young child in a nearby apartment.
   In notes to several Basque newspapers and radio stations, ETA
rejected the government's condition that the group lay down its
weapons before beginning negotiations to end separatist attacks.
   The government also has said it will not talk to ETA until the
group releases businessman Emiliano Revilla, who was kidnapped
outside his Madrid home six months ago.
   ETA, whose name stands for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence for the three-province Basque region
and Navarre, the neighboring region where the attack took place.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people,
mostly civil guard, military and police officers, since taking up
arms in 1968. It has killed eight people this year.
