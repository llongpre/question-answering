   A bomb hidden by Basque terrorists in a
parked van exploded Sunday as police drove by, authorities said.
Two officers were reported killed and two wounded.
   The van was parked on a highway near Santurce, seven miles north
of the northern industrial city of Bilbao, said a police official,
who was not identified under standing rules.
   The bomb was set off by remote control. Police blamed the
radical separatist group ETA, which has carried out similar attacks
in the past, the official said.
   ETA, the Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600
people since 1968, including 19 this year.
   The group seeks independence for the three-province Basque
country of northeastern Spain.
