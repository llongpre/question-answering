scandals threaten to unseat Felipe Gonzalez in three weeks

Just a year ago, as Spain was celebrating the opening of the World's Fair in
Seville and preparing for what would be a glorious summer Olympics, few
could have predicted how quickly the tide would turn against Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez. An economy mired in recession and a wave of corruption
accusations against his Socialist party have turned the general election on
June 6 into a cliffhanger.
The election is being fought against the backdrop of last Thursday's 8 per
cent devaluation of the peseta, the third in eight months, and a crippling
economic slowdown. In the first quarter of the year 253,000 people lost
their jobs, almost 3,000 a day, to take Spanish unemployment to an historic
3.3m, or 21.7 per cent of the working population. This means 1m more people
are out of work now than in 1982, when Mr Gonzalez's Socialists came to
power.
Soaring unemployment merely compounds a gloomy economic picture. The deficit
on Spain's current account, in surplus until 1988, reached 3.3 per cent of
gross domestic product last year, though the recession is now causing it to
fall. The country had the second-highest trade deficit in the west last year
at Dollars 29.2bn. The government, which has overshot public spending
targets by up to 60 per cent in three of the past four years, has been
forced to delay promised personal tax cuts to prop up own finances.
But Mr Gonzalez is not fighting only on the economic front. The Socialists
face a series of corruption allegations over illegal party financing which
have undermined his credibility. He tried, and failed, earlier this year, to
persuade party officials, usually hostile to many government's economic
policies, to take responsibility for the irregularities but nobody was
willing to resign.
Outmanoeuvred and aware that the poor relationship between the government
and the party could not be easily smoothed over, Mr Gonzalez gambled on a
snap election, bringing the vote forward by about five months.
The essence of the gamble was simple. The economy would not show an upturn
before the election and, thus, the Socialists would probably lose their
overall majority in parliament. But Mr Gonzalez was confident the opinion
polls were accurate in showing him to be more popular leader than Mr Jose
Maria Aznar, the young new leader of the conservative opposition, the
Partido Popular (PP), and thus he might keep his job as prime minister. He
was banking on Spain voting, as before, for a strong political leader, and
not concentrating on subtle differences of policy.
The gamble was risky, but it was beginning to pay off: by last Thursday, the
Socialists had crept back into the lead in some polls after trailing at the
beginning of the campaign. With half the electorate still declaring
themselves undecided, the assumption took hold that Mr Gonzalez, rather than
Mr Aznar, had the best chance of winning them over. Most undecided voters
are disillusioned former Socialists who, according to a European diplomat in
Madrid, 'are just waiting for Felipe to give them a reason to stay with him
one more time'.
Then came last week's devaluation. It was a bitter blow to the prime
minister. It coincided with the announcement of a big leap in unemployment
and an uncomfortable 0.4 percentage point increase in inflation in April, to
an annualised rate of 4.6 per cent.
The gamble suddenly looked shaky. But, by early this week, it was difficult
to detect signs that the PP had been able to capitalise on 'Black Thursday'
and put itself decisively at the front of the race. Polls in next Sunday's
newspapers could tell a different story. At this point, however, and despite
the bad news, Mr Gonzalez is still very much in the race.
Partly, this resilience can be explained by the fact that official figures
do not reveal the truth about the economy. Real unemployment is much lower
than the official 3.3m and Mr Gonzalez himself reckons Spain's black economy
might be half as big again as the official Dollars 478.2bn gross domestic
product figure for last year. A few weeks ago, 400,000 small Spanish
investors bid for shares in the partial privatisation of the state's
Argentaria bank. The issue was oversubscribed nearly five times.
Mr Gonzalez is also helped by Mr Aznar's failure to present himself to
voters as a clear and attractive alternative. While he has been able to
unite his party over the past three years, Mr Aznar has failed to put
forward detailed proposals in the campaign on how to stimulate growth.
Instead, the PP has opened itself to criticism for welding together a vague
set of principles - lower taxes, more privatisations, tighter fiscal control
and maintaining infrastructure spending at current levels - that it is
marketing as its economic platform.
Mr Aznar says he needs to do an audit of the state of the country before
deciding how to revive the economy, something he can do only if and when he
assumes office. He cannot rule out raising taxes if the 'audit' shows the
economy in worse shape than he assumes it is. The problem for the PP is that
it agrees broadly with the government's efforts to encourage the Spanish
economy to converge with the rest of the European Community to meet the
timetable for economic and monetary union.
Mr Juan Lladro, one of Spain's leading businessmen and a producer of fine
porcelain figures, says 'very little' would change if the PP were to win the
general election. 'The PP is, in theory, conservative but, in practice, it
would be the same as the Socialists.'
Both parties agree on the need to contain public spending; freeze taxes and
then cut them later; lower interest rates, now at 11.5 per cent, when
inflation is lower; make it easier for employers to hire and fire; support
the peseta within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System; and use public funds to stimulate employment and investment.
But, says Mr Rodrigo Rato, the PP's finance spokesman: 'I, at least, have my
party behind me when I talk like this. Carlos Solchaga (the Socialist
finance minister) has to fight his party all the time.'
But, even with his party behind him in government, Mr Rato would find life
in the new parliament complicated. Spain's two big regional parties - the
PNV which runs the Basque country and the CiU which runs Catalonia - will be
the main power brokers in what is likely to be a hung parliament. If the
result is close, complex coalition negotiations could seriously delay the
formation of a government and result in new pressures being brought to bear
on the peseta.
The financial markets would expect a new administration to put together an
austerity package to cut the current account deficit and thus help anchor
the peseta at its new parity within the ERM. But the regions would demand a
heavy price for their co-operation in the form of a speedier transfer of
political powers from Madrid in areas such as health, education and taxes.
The Catalans and Basques intend to spend the rest of the campaign playing
the Socialists and the PP off against each other to ensure that both big
parties are as weak as possible after the election. The Socialists and the
PP need to win as many seats outright as possible to lessen dependence on
regional assistance.
For his part, Mr Gonzalez is concentrating on swaying undecided voters. He
could still stumble, but the worst of the economic news is probably behind
him. For many people who voted Socialist in 1989 and who are now wavering,
the main election issue is corruption. Building bridges to those former
supporters who now feel betrayed will be delicate work.
For instance, the Socialist attorney-general recently admitted he had
granted an audience to a former policeman jailed for involvement in a secret
war against exiled Basque terrorist group, ETA. The disclosure has renewed
concern that the government secretly financed this 'dirty war' and may
pardon the policeman. That suspicion could cost Mr Gonzalez the votes of
left-leaning doubters.
But, barring further revelations about the government's fight against ETA
during the 1980s, the odds on Mr Gonzalez's returning to the prime
minister's Moncloa Palace residence after June 6 must remain good. It should
be remembered that, two days before the referendum on whether Spain should
stay in Nato in 1986, polls showed Mr Gonzalez - who had staked his job on a
Yes vote - losing. He won.
