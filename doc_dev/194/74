   The Basque separatist organization ETA
claimed responsibility today for the shooting death of a retired
air force general.
   Two men shot and killed Brig. Gen. Luis Azcarraga
Perez-Caballero, 81, Sunday as he left Santa Maria church in
Salvatierra in Alava province with his family and other worshipers.
   Azcarraga Perez-Caballero was the second victim in political
violence in Spain this year. ETA also claimed the shooting death
last week of a Civil Guard officer in the Basque town of Durango.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region. Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has
claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mainly
police, military and Civil Guard officers.
   ETA stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque language.
   In a note sent to Basque newspapers, ETA claimed responsibility
for the slaying and said it would stop its campaign of violence if
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez agreed to talks that would include
the issue of self-determination.
   The Gonzalez government has said it will not talk with the ETA
as long as the ETA continues launching terrorist attacks.
   The government also has said talks with ETA would exclude any
political concessions and focus solely on a plan to get the group
to give up its arms and reintegrate its members into society.
