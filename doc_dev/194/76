<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion by Jose </F>
Maria Brunet; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Brunet] Did you wish to 
begin a new stage at the Interior Ministry? 
  [Asuncion] No. It is a matter of continuing the same plan 
with my own methodology, but the plan's essence is the same. My 
conduct is based on continuity. There is no break in the 
ministry's policy. There are people who believed that they had 
served their term at the ministry and asked to be replaced, and 
we opted for complying with this request, taking into account 
the years that they have spent here. 
  [Brunet] What circumstances define the antiterrorist 
struggle at the beginning of 1994? 
  [Asuncion] We are undoubtedly faring better. A great deal 
of progress has been made in the public response to violence in 
the Basque Country. It is noteworthy progress for society to 
reject this, and for the parties, despite the wrenches that may 
be thrown in the works, to maintain their consensus on 
terrorism. The purely policing aspect must be adjusted to the 
responses that have to be made at each moment. In the political 
sphere, we must continue as until now. The fact that platforms 
for peace are proliferating and organizations whose origin lies 
in the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party] political area are 
softening their message and daring to say that violence leads 
nowhere, seems to me important. There is a substantial change. 
This is undoubtedly drawing Herri Batasuna toward a new 
strategy; hence the dialogue-oriented face that those who have 
been protecting the crime syndicate now wish to present. So it 
is a good thing that they wish to present that image, but I have 
the impression that it is purely electoral strategy; that they 
are going to see whom they deceive. 
  [Brunet] That is happening while attacks are taking place in 
Madrid and Barcelona. 
  [Asuncion] Yes, but that is the inconsistency of what is a 
purely electoral strategy on the part of Herri Batasuna, with 
that image that they wish to present, that concerns them. But 
they have not stopped. We have had attempts and one casualty in 
Barcelona since I arrived at this ministry. There have been 
attempts in Huesca, at a Civil Guard barracks, bombs attached to 
vehicles in Bilbao, 60 kg of amonal [explosive] in Madrid, and 
the attack on a colonel in Barcelona. Hence, the activity is 
continuing, and we must be alert. 
  [Brunet] You have a certain reputation as a hard-liner. 
Does it weary you or are you now accustomed to the idea? 
  [Asuncion] It seems to me that it is completely 
inappropriate that a democratically elected government, where 
citizens are free to express themselves, to carry out their 
political plans, and to conduct politically the representation 
of the people, should have to sit down with a gang of criminals. 
So it is not feasible for a democratically elected government 
to negotiate with a gang of killers who represent only 
themselves. I believe that it is not feasible, has no chance. 
  [Brunet] Against the raising of principles, it can be said 
that this was attempted in Algiers. 
  [Asuncion] Nobody can be accused of a lack of will to try 
everything, but it was found that that did not work out, and 
from that point there has been nothing, not that there can be 
anything. Algiers is unrepeatable. 
  [Brunet] Does the reputation of being a hard-liner bother 
you or not? 
  [Asuncion] Few things bother me, but I believe that it does 
not reflect reality. I am a completely normal individual. I do 
not know the reason for that hard-liner label. The fact is that 
it seems to me that there are stances on which you cannot 
compromise. I do not believe that you can compromise with these 
men of violence, and that you must make appropriate responses. 
If that is being hard-line, I will be, but I believe that that 
is a normal reaction. 
  [Brunet] The impression has been formed that there were 
other people at the Interior Ministry, such as Vera, who were 
considering the possibility of dialogue. 
  [Asuncion] Dialogue is impossible as long as they continue 
to kill. There can be no dialogue with somebody who does not 
wish to have it. I do not know exactly what Vera's personal 
opinion was, but I wish to make it clear that the government 
does not establish channels of dialogue with terrorists, and so 
I believe that Rafael Vera complied in these matters, which are 
government orders that are accepted. Vera left because he was 
tired -- he said so on the first day -- and I understand that 
fact. 
  [Brunet] In the event of ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] 
relinquishing its weapons, how far could the state go in order 
to promote rehabilitation? 
  [Asuncion] It is laid down in the legal procedures. The 
framework created by parliament is the scope that we have. 
Those who break the code are punished. The grounds on which 
you justify your crime are the least of it. Every criminal 
justifies his crime, but he commits it; breaks a rule of conduct. 
  [Brunet] There are people in the prisons who would perhaps 
like to see new prospects.... 
  [Asuncion] The people who are in the prisons are well 
acquainted with the prison law and the regulations. They know 
very well to whom they must turn to that effect. The oversight 
judges are the ones who oversee the carrying out of sentences, 
and so that is not unknown. But if you are referring to 
pardons, that is not feasible. The only thing that is possible 
as a reference point is the political parties' agreements, and 
the framework in which that takes place is the Ajuria Enea 
pacts, which were later reproduced in Madrid. The frame of 
reference is what is now accepted a priori by the political 
parties. 
  [Brunet] How is the dialogue with the People's Party viewed 
at the Interior Ministry? 
  [Asuncion] Whenever there is a preelection atmosphere, the 
People's Party uses these issues. I would ask that we keep cool 
heads and that the elections do not entail a deterioration in 
the political consensus on terrorism. That is undoubtedly what 
would would delight Herri Batasuna; for there to be discord in 
the area of the Ajuria Enea agreements. Our duty is to prevent 
that from happening, with cool heads and setting aside matters 
that could disturb that consensus. After June, everything will 
return to normal, but we must prevent this from breaking down 
now. My opinion is that the Herri Batasuna area will attempt 
this. The steps that they are taking are to try to deceive the 
first person to approach them. 
  [Brunet] Were splits nearly created by the Basque 
Socialists' initiative in favor of dialogue with Herri Batasuna? 
  [Asuncion] No, no, no. There is a great deal of common 
sense in the parties about this matter. So it affects nothing. 
The parties' response has been very favorable. I hope to have 
a meeting with them soon. That was a proposal that the Basque 
Socialist Party should discuss within itself and consider 
whether to bring it before the Ajuria Enea committee, and in any 
event to discuss it there. The fact is that this initiative's 
being leaked without people having knowledge of these matters 
represents an omission, a shadow that had to be explained 
personally to the parties. 
  [Brunet] You say that there is nothing to discuss with ETA. 
What about Herri Batasuna? 
  [Asuncion] Herri Batasuna is now bringing a bill before 
parliament. Let them speak. Let us see what they say. This is 
a bill out of context, publicity seeking, because what they want 
is to change the general organic prison law and the penal code. 
It is a very strange bill, aimed at justifying the lack of 
attention that these people in the Herri Batasuna area have for 
the ETA prisoners. 
  [Brunet] So there is nothing to be said in the interparty 
dialogue.... 
  [Asuncion] It seems to me absurd for those who do not 
frequent the forums for discussion and who renounce the 
political participation that they have had endorsed by elections 
to try to seek other things. At least, it is my impression that 
their inbreeding is such that anything other than ego, 
self-advertisement, and complacency -- specifically political 
confrontation in the institutions -- frightens them. 
  [Brunet] That is, you would advise the Basque Socialists not 
to sit down with Herri Batasuna.... 
  [Asuncion] I will confine myself to making the observations 
that I have just set out. They will know very well what they 
wish to do. Right now, Herri Batasuna would sit down with 
anybody, as long as they present an image different from what 
they really are, but as a mere electioneering strategy. That 
does seem dangerous to me; that any party should give Herri 
Batasuna credibility. That is a matter that should be closely 
watched. It seems to me that this area is very concerned about 
what is happening around it, which is why they have such strong 
reservations with respect to organizations such as Elkarri. 
  [Brunet] Recently, three Herri Batasuna members who were 
going to see Antxon in Santo Domingo were not allowed in. Does 
that have anything to do with these opinions that you are 
expressing? 
  [Asuncion] It seems to me stupid that those who are killing, 
as in the case of Barcelona, should go the next day to see the 
sanhedrin in exile in order to explain. It seems to me totally 
inconsistent. They have no reason now to play any more charades 
of that kind. 
  [Brunet] Was there an explicit request to the Dominican 
Republic? 
  [Asuncion] We would say that the meeting was not authorized. 
  [Brunet] Through diplomatic channels.... 
  [Asuncion] Of course. 
  [Brunet] When the People's Party says that there can never 
be rehabilitation for crimes of bloodshed, is it adopting a 
correct approach? 
  [Asuncion] If the People's Party wishes to carry that out as 
it says, there must be a change in the law. Under the current 
prison law -- which was unanimously approved in parliament, 
including the Popular Alliance -- those distinctions do not 
exist. This does not mean that it will not be changed. Serving 
sentences in full is a proposal advocated by the PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party], which proposes changes in the law for 
this, through the penal code. 
  [Brunet] The Basque Nationalist Party seems not to share 
that view. 
  [Asuncion] The matter was resolved within the framework of 
the Ajuria Enea pacts, also signed by the People's Party. The 
fact is that what the People's Party signs is one thing, and 
what it says is another, but the real issue will be seen in 
March. The penal code will be approved in that month, and I 
have already said what the PSOE's election pledge was. Insofar 
as agreement can be reached on the proposal, that will be the 
legal framework that will define a new dynamic. 
  [Brunet] That is, you are clearly in favor of serving 
sentences in full. 
  [Asuncion] Of course. [passage omitted]
