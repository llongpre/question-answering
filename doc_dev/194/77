Spain has been taking a searching look at itself this week and its many and
varied parts have decided it is time to move a bit further apart.
The push for what could prompt a first amendment to Spain's 1978
constitution follows a three-day debate in the senate. It underlined the
complexity of a country that is multi-lingual, multi-cultural and, as some
would have it, multi-national.
At an immediate level the cleavages in the Spanish state are expressed
linguistically; five of the 16 autonomous community presidents at the debate
(there are 17 such areas, but the Basques stayed away) delivered their
speeches in languages other than Spanish, or, as Spaniards say, languages
other than Castilian.
The spectacle of senior Spanish politicians avoiding their common language
to sort out their differences prompted one Madrid political commentator to
write that the senate sittings had 'gone beyond the limits of what is
imaginable, to become hallucinatory'.
The constitution set off the decentralisation process, dividing
administration of Spain into 17 so-called autonomous communities. Some have
acquired powers more quickly than others, although by the end of the
process, which is open-ended, it is intended there should be no
discrimination between them.
Over the next two years a committee of more than 60 senators and judicial
experts will be putting together a constitutional reform package.
'We are looking towards a properly functioning territorial chamber that will
borrow elements from the US senate and from the (German) Bundesrat,' said Mr
Oswaldo Brito, a senator representing the Canary Islands.
The founder and leader of Catalonia's ruling nationalist party and president
of the Catalan autonomous community of north-east Spain, Mr Jordi Pujol,
told the senate gathering that there would always be qualitative differences
between historic nationalities such as his homeland and other communities.
'There can be no doubts that Catalonia is a nation,' he told the senate in
his native Catalan language.
Speaking in the lisping Castilian that characterises the south of Spain, Mr
Manuel Chaves, the socialist president of the Andalucia, the most populous
and one of the most economically deprived of the autonomous communities,
warned that any change to the existing guidelines would have to 'respect the
principle of equality that is enshrined in the constitution'.
Andalucia has already opposed an arrangement negotiated by the Catalans
which allows the community governments to spend 15 per cent of the income
tax raised in their jurisdiction as they see fit. It says this would allow
wealthy Catalonia to widen regional imbalances.
The position of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, is an awkward one as
his minority Socialist government is dependent on the support of Mr Pujol's
Catalan nationalists.
An altogether more prosaic, but no less keenly felt, issue was a squabble
over the transfer of water reserves from central Spain to the drought-ridden
fruit orchards by the Mediterranean coast.
Many of the present problems originate in Spain's fast switch to democracy
after the death of General Franco in 1975. The transition government had to
address the long repressed nationalist sentiment in Catalonia and in the
Basque country but, wary of the right wing and of Franco's army, it sought
to defuse home rule in those areas by extending it to the rest of Spain.
The result has been an unsatisfactory mix between certain communities which
can claim genuine political and cultural identities and others, like the
Madrid autonomy that sprawls out from the Spanish capital, that lack any
such attributes.
For all its shortcomings the autonomous system set up by the constitution
has served a purpose; applauding it El Pais, Spain's leading newspaper,
noted that its critics should 'just think about Yugoslavia'.
The Basque Country's president, Mr Jose Antonio Ardanza, best illustrated
the sort of differences that lie ahead. He chose to stay away from the
senate debates, saying they constituted a 'theatrical experiment' and a
'dialogue of the deaf'.
