French police arrested 10 Spanish Basque militants, including Jose Antonio 
Urutigoechea, considered by Madrid to be a top leader of the Spanish Basque 
separatist organization ETA, French authorities said in Bayonne. Spanish 
officials, party leaders and newspapers hailed the arrest of Urutigoechea, 38, 
and said Spain will seek his extradition. Urutigoechea, better known by the 
nickname Josu Ternera, is regarded as the top man and the toughest hard-liner 
in ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom), a guerrilla group that has killed more 
than 600 people in a 21-year campaign for Basque independence from Spain. 
Basque regional President Jose Antonio Ardanza said the group could react with 
a vengeance.
