<HEAD>ETA Kidnapping Appears to End Truce That Led to Talks</HEAD>

   Basque separatists appear to have broken a
60-day truce they offered the government by kidnapping 58-year-old
businessman Emiliano Revilla Sanza, officials said Thursday.
   Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra told reporters the
government considers the kidnapping an attack by the Basque
separatist organization ETA and will not pursue contacts begun with
the organization ``because we don't talk with terrorists.''
   Rafael Vazquez, a spokesman for the Revilla family, said there
had been no contact with armed kidnappers who seized Revilla at
11:30 p.m. Wednesday outside his home in central Madrid. He said
the family did not know the identity of the three men and a woman
witnesses saw forcing Revilla into a car.
   The kidnapping of the well-known Madrid real estate developer
occurred after reports that the government had resumed contacts
over the weekend with ETA members in exile in Algeria.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Basque land and liberty in the
Basque language, has taken responsibility for killing more than 600
people in a 20-year campaign for independence in Spain's three
northern Basque provinces.
   During his annual address to Parliament on Wednesday, Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez said Spaniards should not lower their
guard against terrorism despite optimism created by reports of
contacts between the government and ETA.
   Gonzalez said his government had agreed to resume talks only if
the organization respected a 60-day truce offer it made Jan. 28.
   The government broke off preliminary talks with ETA in Algiers
after the group claimed responsibility for the Dec. 11 car bombing
of a Zaragoza Civil Guard barracks in which 11 people were killed.
   Since 1977, ETA has kidnapped 63 people, most of them Basque
businessmen, to raise funds for its operations.
