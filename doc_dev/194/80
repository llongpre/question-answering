Take Aznar Into Account To Make New `Turnabout in Autonomy'"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The government intends to take the 
People's Party and its leader, Jose Maria Aznar, into account in 
order to carry through the turnabout in autonomy in the 
fast-track autonomous communities -- the Basque Country, 
Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia. The government believes that 
although the People's Party is in power in only one of those 
four communities -- Galicia -- an agreement with the leading 
opposition party is absolutely necessary because the new impetus 
to autonomy affects the state's territorial configuration. 
  Specifically, the government is contemplating transferring 
exclusive state powers to the autonomous communities by the 
delegation procedure envisaged in Article 150, paragraph 2 of 
the Constitution. These would include the administration of 
social security and the National Employment Institute (INEM). 
  In fact, the government has already taken the People's Party 
into account in all the steps which it has taken to configure 
Spain territorially since in February 1992 Felipe Gonzalez and 
Jose Maria Aznar signed the autonomy pacts in order to raise the 
slow-track autonomous communities' ceiling of powers. Recently, 
the two parties have also agreed on the setting up of a 
autonomous communities general committee in the Senate. 
<H5>  Surprise </H5>
  Generalitat [Catalan autonomous community] premier Jordi 
Pujol's proposal of a pact with the throne is viewed with some 
surprise by the central government, but excessive importance is 
notattached to it. "It is one of so many drafts which Jordi 
Pujol could put forward. At the moment of truth, he will 
undertake a realistic negotiation of new powers, as has happened 
on other occasions," government sources state. 
  To the same effect, the government's reaction is not to back 
down from its pledge to carry through the turnabout in autonomy, 
despite the proposal put forward by Pujol. "The government has 
an election pledge to give the fast-track autonomous communities 
new powers, and it will fulfill it," the sources consulted add. 
  However, the same sources deem the negotiating process with 
the Basque government a good deal more complicated that that 
with the Catalan Generalitat. In their opinion, the Basque 
Nationalist Party is immersed in a preliminary election campaign 
for the autonomous community elections in the fall, and this 
will make it very difficult to conduct a rational negotiating 
process. However, the situation in Catalonia is very different. 
"Jordi Pujol wishes to wrap the turnabout in autonomy in a 
spectacular format," according to the sources consulted. 
  Officially, the government maintains that it will give no 
official opinion on the Generalitat's document until it receives 
it, as Miguel Gil, the government spokesperson's secretary 
general, stated yesterday, adding that for the present there is 
no date for the next meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol.
