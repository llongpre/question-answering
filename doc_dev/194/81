  [Text] Bilbao (Spain), 13 Jan (EFE) -- The extremist group 
Iraultza (Revolution, in the Basque language), has claimed 
responsibility for an attack yesterday on the Mexican Consulate 
in Bilbao, in the northern Basque country. There were no 
victims or substantial property damage. 
  Iraultza, an extremist group not linked to ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty Orgainzation] and which usually attacks 
state organizations, claimed responsibility for the attack in a 
call to the newspaper EGIN, the traditional mouthpiece of this 
terrorist band. 
  An official spokesman said that only the bomb's "primer," 
which was homemade and had been placed at the Consulate's 
entrance, exploded. 
  According to Vice Consul Jose Miguel Arechavala, nine days 
ago a telephone call was made to the Consulate. The caller said 
he was calling on behalf of Iraultza. He threatened to plant a 
bomb to protest the Mexican Government's action in the armed 
conflict in Chiapas State. 
  In recent days, demonstrations and rallies have been 
organized in several places of Spain to protest the actions of 
the Mexican Army in the insurrection of peasants and Indians in 
Chiapas.
