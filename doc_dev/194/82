<F P=106> [Interview with Spanish Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion by </F>
Jose Maria Brunet; place, date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [introductory passage omitted] [Brunet] What 
circumstances define the antiterrorist struggle at the beginning 
of 1994? 
  Asuncion: We are undoubtedly faring better. A 
great deal of progress has been made in the public response to 
violence in the Basque Country. It is noteworthy progress for 
society to reject this, and for the parties, despite the 
wrenches which may be thrown in the works, to maintain their 
consensus on terrorism. The purely policing aspect must be 
adjusted to the responses which have to be made at each moment. 
In the political sphere, we must continue as before. The fact 
that platforms for peace are proliferating and organizations 
whose origin lies in the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party] 
political area are softening their message and daring to say 
that violence leads nowhere, seems to me important. There is a 
substantial change. This is undoubtedly drawing Herri Batasuna 
toward a new strategy; hence the dialogue-oriented face which 
those who have been protecting the crime syndicate now wish to 
present. So it is a good thing that they wish to present that 
image, but I have the impression that it is purely electoral 
strategy; that they are going to see whom they deceive. 
  Brunet: That is happening while attacks are 
taking place in Madrid and Barcelona. 
  Asuncion: Yes, but that is the inconsistency of 
what is a purely electoral strategy on the part of Herri 
Batasuna, with that image which they wish to present, which 
concerns them. But they have not stopped. We have had attempts 
and one casualty in Barcelona since I arrived at this ministry. 
There have been attempts in Huesca, at a Civil Guard barracks, 
bombs attached to vehicles in Bilbao, 60 kg of amonal 
[explosive] in Madrid, and the attack on a colonel in Barcelona. 
Hence, the activity is continuing and we must be alert. 
  Brunet: You have a certain reputation as a 
hard-liner. Does it weary you or are you now accustomed to the 
idea? 
  Asuncion: It seems to me that it is completely 
inappropriate that a democratically elected government, where 
citizens are free to express themselves, to carry out their 
political plans, and to conduct politically the representation 
of the people, should have to sit down with a gang of criminals. 
So it is not feasible for a democratically elected government 
to negotiate with a gang of killers who represent only 
themselves. I believe that it is not feasible, has no chance. 
  Brunet: Against the raising of principles, it can 
be said that this was attempted in Algiers. 
  Asuncion: Nobody can be accused of a lack of will 
to try everything, but it was found that that did not work out, 
and from that point there has been nothing, nor can there be 
anything. Algiers is unrepeatable. 
  Brunet: Does the reputation of being a hard-liner 
bother you or not? 
  Asuncion: Few things bother me, but I believe 
that it does not reflect reality. I am a completely normal 
individual. I do not know the reason for that hard-liner label. 
The fact is that it seems to me that there are stances on which 
you cannot compromise. I do not believe that you can compromise 
with these men of violence, and that you must make appropriate 
responses. If that is being hard-line, I will be, but I believe 
that that is a normal reaction. 
  Brunet: The impression has been formed that there 
were other people at the Interior Ministry, such as Vera, who 
were considering the possibility of dialogue. 
  Asuncion: Dialogue is impossible as long as they 
continue to kill. There can be no dialogue with somebody who 
does not wish to have it. I do not know exactly what Vera's 
personal opinion was, but I wish to make it clear that the 
government does not establish channels of dialogue with 
terrorists, and so I believe that Rafael Vera complied in these 
matters, which are government orders which are accepted. Vera 
left because he was tired -- he said so on the first day -- and 
I understand that fact. 
  Brunet: In the event of ETA [Basque Homeland and 
Liberty] relinquishing its weapons, how far could the state go 
in order to promote rehabilitation? 
  Asuncion: It is laid down in the legal 
procedures. The framework created by parliament is the scope 
which we have. Those who break the code are punished. The 
grounds on which you justify your crime are the least of it. 
Every criminal justifies his crime, but he commits it; breaks a 
rule of conduct. 
  Brunet: There are people in the prisons who would 
perhaps like to see new prospects... 
  Asuncion: The people who are in the prisons are 
well acquainted with the prison law and the regulations. They 
know very well to whom they must turn to that effect. The 
oversight judges are the ones who oversee the carrying out of 
sentences, and so that is not unknown. But if you are referring 
to pardons, that is not feasible. The only thing that is 
possible as a reference point is the political parties' 
agreements, and the framework in which that takes place is the 
Ajuria Enea pacts, which were later reproduced in Madrid. The 
frame of reference is what is now accepted a priori by the 
political parties. 
  Brunet: How is the dialogue with the People's 
Party viewed at the Interior Ministry? 
  Asuncion: Whenever there is a pre-election 
atmosphere, the People's Party uses these issues. I would ask 
that we keep cool heads and that the elections do not entail a 
deterioration in the political consensus on terrorism. That is 
undoubtedly what would would delight Herri Batasuna; for there 
to be discord in the area of the Ajuria Enea agreements. Our 
duty is to prevent that from happening, with cool heads and 
setting aside matters which could disturb that consensus. After 
June, everything will return to normal, but we must prevent this 
from breaking down now. My opinion is that the Herri Batasuna 
area will attempt this. The steps which they are taking are to 
try to deceive the first person to approach them. [passage 
omitted] 
  Brunet: You say that there is nothing to discuss 
with ETA. What about Herri Batasuna? 
  Asuncion: Herri Batasuna is now bringing a bill 
before parliament. Let them speak. Let us see what they say. 
This is a bill out of context, publicity seeking, because what 
they want is to change the general organic prison law and the 
penal code. It is a very strange bill, aimed at justifying the 
lack of attention which these people in the Herri Batasuna area 
have for the ETA prisoners. [passage omitted] 
  Brunet: Recently, three Herri Batasuna members 
who were going to see Antxon in Santo Domingo were not allowed 
in. Does that have anything to do with these opinions which you 
are expressing? 
  Asuncion: It seems to me stupid that those who 
are killing, as in the case of Barcelona, should go the next day 
to see the sanhedrin in exile in order to explain. It seems to 
me totally inconsistent. They have no reason now to play any 
more charades of that kind. 
  Brunet: Was there an explicit request to the 
Dominican Republic? 
  Asuncion: We would say that the meeting was not 
authorized. 
  Brunet: Through diplomatic channels... 
  Asuncion: Of course. [passage omitted]
