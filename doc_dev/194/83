   Two masked youths fatally shot a national
policeman in this Basque city today, and police blamed the attack on
Basque separatists.
   The shooting took place outside a police station in the northern
city of Bilbao, police said. The youths fled the scene in a stolen
car, which police later found abandoned about five miles away.
   No group claimed responsibility, but police said they suspected
the Basque separatist organization ETA, which seeks independence
from Spain for the three-province northern Basque region.
   Officer Cristobal Diaz Garcia suffered a single bullet wound to
the chest and died at nearby Basurto Hospital, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed more than 600
killings, mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers, in their
20-year violent campaign for independence. ETA is an acronym in the
Basque language that stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty.
