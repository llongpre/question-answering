   Two Civil Guards were in serious
condition today with injuries suffered in a car bomb explosion, the
latest in a series of recent attacks blamed on Basque separatists.
   The blast occurred late Friday in Pasajes, near San Sebastian's
port, as the guards drove by a car packed with explosives, said
Guipuzcoa Civil Gov. Jose Ramon Goni Tirapu.
   The guards were investigating a bomb threat telephoned by a man
who said he was speaking for ETA, the Basque terrorist group, when
the explosion occurred, he said. ETA is a Basque acronym for
homeland and liberty.
   Meanwhile, most rail service to the south and the east was
suspended today after an ETA threat on Wednesday that it planned to
set off bombs by midnight Saturday on rail lines linking Madrid
with Seville and Valencia.
   The state railway company RENFE transferred thousands of
passengers to buses outside Madrid for transit to southern Seville
and eastern Valencia, a spokesman for the railroad said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people
in its 21-year campaign to secure independence for the
three-province northern Basque region.
   On April 4, after breaking off peace talks with the government,
ETA announced it would return to terrorism and call off a
three-month moratorium on violence.
   On Wednesday, ETA gunmen shot to death a Civil Guardsman near
Bilbao and claimed responsibility for six bombs mailed to the
Madrid offices of two ministers, the office of a Basque region
official, a military school in the Pyrenees and a Basque apartment
building.
   Bomb experts defused four bombs but two others exploded,
seriously injuring a Basque gym teacher and an Army sergeant.
   In San Sebastian, Tirapu said ETA members had packed the car
with about 66 pounds of explosives. The San Sebastian Red Cross
Hospital said the injured guards, Andres Sanchez Garcia, 38, and
Matias Martinez Silva, 26, were in serious condition with shrapnel
wounds.
