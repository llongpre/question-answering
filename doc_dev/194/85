   A car bomb explosion believed
triggered by Basque separatists killed two policemen and injured
three after a shooting incident apparently aimed at luring police,
authorities said today.
   In a statement, the ministry said the blast occurred Monday
night outside a maximum security prison in this city just east of
Madrid about 10 minutes after gunmen shot a prison employee as he
drove away from the facility.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but police said
it appeared to have been carried out by the Basque separatist
organization ETA.
   At least 40 ETA members convicted of terrorist-related crimes
are serving sentences at the prison, known as Alcala-Meco.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region. During its 21-year campaign of violence,
the group has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600
people, mainly police and paramilitary Civil Guard officers.
   The Interior Ministry said the attack outside the prison began
when gunmen shot at the employee's car, causing the man to lose
control of the vehicle in a field and flee on foot while still
under fire.
   Minutes later, a police van carrying 12 officers left the prison
for Madrid accompanied by other police officers in private cars.
   They spotted the employee waving for them to stop and his
abandoned car with its lights on and doors open, the ministry said.
   Several policemen rescued the prison employee, while five
officers proceeded to inspect the man's abandoned car, the ministry
said.
   During the inspection, a bomb placed in the car's rear seats
exploded, killing two police officers and slightly injuring three
others, the ministry said.
   The prison employee received two bullet wounds in the back and
was listed in serious condition following surgery, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   The deaths come a little more than a month after ETA called off
its moratorium on attacks against government targets when peace
talks between exiled ETA leaders and Spanish officials collapsed.
   Early today, two bombs exploded at separate car dealerships of
the French company Renault in the Basque city of Bilbao and a third
bomb ripped through a Renault dealership in the Basque town of
Zarauz, police said.
   The blasts damaged several cars on display and shattered windows
in parked cars and adjacent buildings, but caused no serious
injuries, police said. No group claimed the bombings, police said.
   Also today, officials of the state-owned RENFE railroad
suspended services between the northern cities of Miranda de Ebro
and Castejon after a phone caller identifying himself as an ETA
member told Red Cross officials the group had planted a bomb on
tracks there.
