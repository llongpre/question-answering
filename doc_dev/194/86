   A package bomb exploded early today
in the doorway of a police residence, injuring two people,
including a 7-year-old girl, Spanish National Radio said.
   The bomb went off about 2 a.m. in a three-story residence of
policemen and their families in this northern Spanish Basque town,
the radio said.
   The radio said there could be more people injured in the rubble
of the building. There were no other details available immediately.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bomb, but the
radio said it could be the work of the Basque separatist group ETA.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, has claimed responsibility for more than 600 violent
deaths since 1968, including 15 this year. The group wants
independence for the three-province Basque country.
