   Attackers believed to be Basque separatists
on Tuesday fatally shot a prosecutor and killed a store owner with a
parcel bomb in the northern city of Bilbao, police said.
   The shooting took place at about 3:30 p.m. when two gunmen in a
car fired automatic weapons at Carmen Tagle Gonzalez, 44, killing
her instantly, police said. She had been driving home at the time,
police said. She was one of the chief prosecutors of the National
Court, which has jurisdiction over terrorism cases.
   Five hours later in Bilbao, a provincial capital 200 miles north
of Madrid, fish store owner Luis Reina Mesonera died when he opened
a parcel bomb, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but
police said they suspected the Basque separatist group ETA.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region.
   Since beginning its 21-year-old campaign for independence, ETA
has claimed responsibility for the deaths of more than 600 people,
mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers.
