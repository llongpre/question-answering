   A small bomb believed set by Basque
separatists exploded Saturday on a railroad track southeast of the
capital, causing slight damage but no injuries, a railroad
spokesman said.
   Police later safely deactivated a second bomb found on a railway
east of Madrid, a paramilitary Civil Guard spokesman said.
   The explosion occurred on the Madrid-Valencia track between the
stations of Villarubia de Santiago and Santa Cruz de la Zarza in
Toledo province, said Inaki Barron, a spokesman for the state-run
RENFE train company. The track was closed at the time of the blast.
   Five hours later, police deactivated a bomb on the same line in
eastern Cuenca province, said the Civil Guard spokesman, who was
not identified in keeping with regulations.
   The spokesman said the deactivated bomb consisted of 250 grams
of explosives. He said it was believed planted by the Basque
separatist group ETA.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but ETA said
Wednesday it would set off bombs on both the Madrid-Seville and
Madrid-Valencia railroad lines between midnight Wednesday and
midnight Saturday.
   RENFE suspended rail traffic on both lines after the threat. The
two lines cover 620 miles and carry about 10,000 people a day.
   RENFE put thousands of passengers on buses for the ride to
southern Seville and eastern Valencia, Barron said.
   More than 600 people have died in ETA's 21-year-old campaign to
secure independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region.
   On April 4, ETA said it was suspending a three-month moratorium
on attacks on government targets following the collapse of talks
between the organization and government officials.
   On Friday, a car bomb blamed on ETA seriously injured two Civil
Guardsmen in the Basque city of San Sebastian.
   On Wednesday, ETA gunmen shot to death a policeman near Bilbao
and mailed six bombs to two ministers, a Basque official, a
military school in the Pyrenees and a Basque apartment building.
   Bomb experts deactivated four of the bombs, but two others
exploded, seriously injuring a Basque teacher and an army sergeant.
