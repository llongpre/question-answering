<F P=106> [Aurora Intxausti report: "Arzalluz Warns of People's </F>
Party's Scheme To Overthrow Gonzalez and Rough Up His Successor"] 
  [Text] San Sebastian -- Yesterday Basque Nationalist Party 
[PNV] chairman Xabier Arzalluz stated that he was not prepared 
to cooperate with the People's Party in the strategy to 
overthrow Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. "The People's Party 
is aiming to overthrow Gonzalez. It does not want elections 
now, it wants Gonzalez to resign and another Socialist to 
replace him, so that they can rough him up nicely for a year, 
then hold general elections and obtain an absolute majority." 
Arzalluz believes that this strategy by the People's Party is 
no good for either the Basque or the Catalan nationalists. "It 
is no good for the country, nor for us nationalists," he said. 
  Arzalluz, who met Gonzalez last Wednesday at the Moncloa 
palace, stated that the purpose of the meeting had been to 
analyze the political situation, and that no agreements or 
common plans had been reached. The PNV's leader denied, in this 
connection, that Gonzalez had suggested forming a coalition 
government including the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers' 
Party], the PNV, and CiU [Convergence and Union]. 
  The "lehendakari" Jos Antonio Ardanza explained this aspect 
further, stating that no changes had occurred in the last eight 
months to warrant the PNV's joining the government. 
<H5>  The Confidence Issue </H5>
  Contrary to what a number of opposition parties are 
requesting, Xabier Arzalluz believes that Felipe Gonzalez need 
not submit to a vote of confidence. "I believe Gonzalez does 
enjoy people's confidence, because in fact the people have 
ratified their trust in him. Technically speaking, it makes no 
sense for him to propose a confidence vote; rather, it is the 
opposition who must table a no- confidence motion," he stated. 
The PNV chairman said he was convinced that the government was 
doing everything in its power to arrest the Guardia Civil former 
director Luis Roldan, and he believed that the corruption issue 
was being used as an easy argument for demagogic purposes. 
  Despite these supportive statements, the "lehendakari" 
confirmed that his party's relations with the PSOE, the central 
government, and the socialists had not improved over the last 
few months. "Eight months ago -- for the reasons we explained at 
the time -- we were not able to reach an understanding, but the 
truth is that things have not improved." 
  "Eight months ago," he added, "we stated that seven years 
had 
gone by without any new responsibilities being transferred. 
Today we can say that very soon eight years will have gone by 
and still nothing has changed." 
  Ardanza then said curtly: "The Socialist government's 
situation has not improved either, and these are the objective 
data." "Yesterday (Wednesday -- EL PAIS editor's note), seeing 
how events were snowballing, I pointed to the urgent need for 
the captain of this ship named the Spanish Government to face up 
to the situation that has been created," he concluded.
