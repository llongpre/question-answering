<F P=106> [Cristina de la Hoz report: "Aznar and Arzalluz Unblock </F>
Their Relations and Establish a Line of Cooperation"] 
  [Text] [People's Party Chairman] Jose Maria Aznar and 
[Basque Nationalist Party, PNV, Chairman] Xabier Arzalluz met 
Tuesday [29 March] in order to unblock relations between their 
parties. The two leaders, who had not talked since June 1991, 
decided to establish a stable channel of communication, 
especially with respect to autonomy and economic issues and 
cooperation in the Congress [of Deputies]. The People's Party 
also acknowledges the possibility of taking part in the next 
Basque government. 
  The meeting took place at a private house midway between 
Burgos and the Basque Country, and helped break three years of 
noncommunication since the two politicians met 12 June 1991. 
Accompanied by Jaime Mayor Oreja, People's Party chairman in the 
Basque Country, and by Juan Maria Ollora of the PNV, Aznar and 
Arzalluz mainly centered their four-hour conversation on the 
economic and autonomy situations and on the need to recover a 
certain world of values, Mayor Oreja told ABC yesterday. 
  However, the main aim was to unblock a relationship which 
was 
virtually nonexistent, since, although both leaders have 
attended European People's Party meetings, they have not 
directly exchanged a word, although they have indirectly 
exchanged many mutual accusations. 
  Arzalluz expressed his concern about the implementation of 
autonomy and even handed the People's Party leader a document 
containing his party's stance on the matter, which dwelt 
especially on the single social security fund. But there was 
most agreement on the situation of "grave" economic and 
industrial crisis which Spain is experiencing, as Mayor Oreja 
explained to this newspaper, and for this reason Aznar and 
Arzalluz decided that their respective parties will continue 
their contacts after Easter Week. 
  The People's Party and the PNV are thus establishing new 
channels of communication which will also be manifested between 
the parliamentary groups in the Congress, although Mayor Oreja 
refused to speak of the existence of any common front, but 
asserted, on the other hand, the need for less rigidity in 
relations between the two parties. 
  The initiative for the meeting, the same sources added, was 
shared, and came following a conversation four weeks ago between 
the People's Party chairman in the Basque Country and 
Lehendakari [Basque premier] Jose Antonio Ardanza. 
  Emphasis was also placed on giving greater impetus to 
regeneration of the institutions. An issue which was broached 
very superficially -- "it really was discussed very little" -- 
was terrorism, perhaps in order to avoid tensions in a 
conversation which would have made clear the deep differences. 
As Mayor Oreja explained, the People's Party is opposed to ETA 
[Basque Homeland and Liberty] members' rehabilitation taking 
place through a decision of the Basque parliament. 
  The unblocking of relations between the People's Party and 
the PNV occurs against the backdrop of the holding of the next 
Basque elections in the fall. In this connection, and since all 
the parties seem to be open to any cooperation formula in order 
to form a government, the People's Party is not ruling out 
joining in that combination, and a PNV-People's Party government 
could be conjectured, at least in theory. However, Mayor Oreja 
emphasized that the People's Party's sole aim is to rise in this 
community, and described any other kind of conjecture as 
premature "until we know the results." 
  For his part, Basque premier Jose Antonio Ardanza described 
the meeting as very positive, although he would say nothing 
about possible future coalitions following the elections. He 
stated that it is his party's duty, "because of the major 
government responsibility which it has been exercising since the 
transition," to maintain relations "at both ends of the 
political spectrum."
