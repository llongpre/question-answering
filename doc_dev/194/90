   A car bomb detonated by remote control
exploded as three police vans drove through this Basque town Sunday,
killing one officer and injuring six officers and nine civilians,
police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but police blamed it
on Basque separatists, who took up arms in 1968 in an effort to gain
independence for the three Basque provinces in northern Spain.
   The car bomb exploded as the vans were driving toward Ipurua
stadium, where the police officers were assigned to help maintain
order at a soccer match.
   The game was canceled after the explosion, which damaged two of
the vans and killed policeman Jose Antonio Barrado. It also injured
six officers and nine passersby, damaged parked cars and smashed
windows in nearby buildings.
   Police blamed the Basque separatist group ETA, the initials for
the words Basque Land and Liberty in the Basque language. ETA has
claimed responsibility for the killing of 17 people, mostly police
and soldiers, so far this year.
   On Nov. 23, ETA detonated a car bomb near the headquarters of the
paramilitary civil guard in Madrid that killed two people and
injured 44.
   On the same day, Basque separatists set off three bombs in and
around the city of Bilbao, damaging three French cars dealerships
but causing no injures.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people
since 1968.
