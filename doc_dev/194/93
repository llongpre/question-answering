   Nine French Basque militants suspected of being
part of a roving commando unit that carried out terrorist attacks
in Spain have been charged and jailed, judicial sources said Monday.
   The nine, eight men and one woman, were transferred Sunday to
Paris from Bayonne in a military transport plane. Judge Gilles
Boulouque, who specializes in terrorist investigations, charged
them Sunday night with criminal association related to a terrorist
enterprise, the judicial sources said, speaking on condition they
not be named. Three of them were also charged with possession of
arms and explosives.
   The sources said that six of the nine admitted taking part in
numerous attacks on Spanish soil. No charges on those counts were
immediately brought because Spanish authorities had not yet
officially complained to France.
   The nine were arrested Wednesday, two days after Spanish police
arrested another Frenchman, Henri Parot, in Seville, Spain. Police
found 660 pounds of explosives in his car. Parot confessed to
participating in attacks that killed 33 people in Spain over the
past few years, Spanish police sources said Sunday.
   Parot's brother, Jean Parot, was among the nine arrested last
week.
   The alleged commando unit is said to have trained in the hills
of France's Basque country, in southwestern France. They are
accused of being members of a French network of the Spanish ETA
movement, which is fighting for independence for the Spanish Basque
country.
