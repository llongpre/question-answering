   Five bombs believed to have been planted
by Basque separatists exploded early today at a railroad line,
officials said. The attacks follow a three-month truce and could
signal a new round of Basque violence.
   The explosives went off at two points at the railway in the
northern Navarre region, damaging tracks and a power substation,
officials said. No injuries were reported.
   Two hours before the predawn blasts, a man telephoned a local
travelers' aid bureau and said the Basque separatist organization,
known by its Basque initials ETA, had placed several bombs on the
rail line that were to explode within a few hours, the civil
governor's office said.
   The bombings represent the first attacks linked to ETA since
Jan. 8, when the group called a halt to attacks in exchange for
peace talks with the government. The group wants independence for
the three-province northern Basque region, but the government says
it will only talk when ETA ceases fighting.
   ETA broke off its talks with Spanish officials in Algiers,
Algeria, earlier this week, claiming the government of Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez had reneged on terms for more talks and a
prolonged halt on anti-government attacks.
   Also today, police were investigating a mail bomb that exploded
Friday in an apartment in the northern Basque town of Irun,
seriously injuring a 27-year-old man.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility. Authorities said
they had not ruled out the possibility that ETA was behind it.
   Since beginning its 21-year campaign for Basque
self-determination, ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more
than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers.
