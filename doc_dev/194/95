The fishing industry

Fishing is much more than an industry or pastime in the Basque Country. And
consuming fish is much more than a means of satisfying hunger.
For a Basque, catching a fish is more of a historical right, an assertion of
culture. To prepare and eat a fish is more the culinary equivalent of high
art than mere cooking.
But, as with many other aspects of Basque life, the impact of Spain's
membership of the European Union is being felt in this most traditional of
Basque activities. The region's fishing industry has been forced to curtail
its operations, as has the fishing industry in the rest of Spain. But for
the Basque Country, with unemployment levels officially approaching the 30
per cent mark, any contraction of such a traditional industry is bound to
have serious economic and social consequences.
Spaniards on average eat 43kg of fish annually; more than the citizens of
most other EU member states. In overall terms, the fishing industry has
historically diminished in its importance to the Basque Country's economy to
the point where it now contributes not more than 1 per cent of gross
domestic product.
'However, there are coastal areas where the population depends almost
entirely on fishing, populations where if fishing disappeared then so too
would the population,' says Mr Jose Ignacio Espell, deputy director of
fishing in the Basque regional government, based in Vitoria. 'They are
places where fishing contributes more than 25 per cent of the local GDP.'
The most immediately visible impact of the EU on the Basque Country's
fishing industry has been the reduction in the number of fishing vessels;
down from 748 in 1984 to about 560 now. Basque fishing boats represent about
3 per cent of the total Spanish fishing fleet. The diminution is a direct
result of EU-imposed quotas.
'In the 1970s, there were 200 fishing vessels from the port of Pasajes alone
that fished in EU waters. Today, there remain just 38. The cod fishing fleet
of Pasajes, which fishes in Canadian waters, had 100 ships. Now there are
24. So the EU decisions about quotas and shipping numbers were, for us, very
bad,' says Mr Espell.
Spain overall had 19,451 fishing vessels, the largest such fleet in the EU,
at the end of January 1992.
But besides the limits imposed on the number of vessels, the EU implemented
other restrictions too; on what types of fish the vessels could catch and on
where they might seek shoals of fish.
'They (Brussels) put us in a corset,' says Mr Espell. 'But at least we have
one good thing: fishermen - people who know how to fish] Basque fishermen
have managed to find jobs elsewhere, for example in the French fleets.'
Mr Espell is critical of the way in which the EU has handled his country's
fishing fleet, but at the same time he exudes the kind of Basque pragmatism
that has sustained the region through many difficult political and economic
times.
'I always say the same thing. We have been very pressured, with enormous
restrictions placed on us. I say that we do not ask for advantages, but nor
do we want to be discriminated against. And I think the EU has understood
that, because it now speaks of a single-speed European fishing policy.
'Right now there has been a two-speed policy: that of the other 10, and that
of the two, Spain and Portugal. From 1996 there will be a single-speed
policy, for all,' says Mr Espell.
From 1996 what Mr Espell describes as the EU's 'discrimination' against
Spain and Portugal will disappear, 'because once Norway enters the EU it
will be absurd for there to be three different fishing policies: a third one
for Norway.'
Despite his objections to EU policy so far, Mr Espell nevertheless believes
that it is far better to be inside the EU than outside, since non-EU members
will, he believes, progressively find their own fish exports more
discriminated against in the future.
The EU is re-writing the regulations for Spanish and Portuguese fishing, and
is due to produce a new policy for the two countries by January 1 1994 to be
implemented two years later.
According to Mr Espell, the new policy will 'mean that the two can fish on
the same basis as the other 10 EU members.'
But that will not mean growth in the Basque Country's fishing industry, or
that of Spain as a whole, thinks Mr Espell. 'At the moment the fishing
policy of the EU says that it is necessary to adapt the fleet to the fish
resources. We are all conscious of the need to do that, and so there is no
way we will increase the size of our fishing fleet. What it does mean,
however, is that we will be able to renovate our old fleets and improve
them, though not increase their size. We will just be able to fish on equal
terms with the rest of the EU.'
There still remains the problem of imports to the EU from non-EU members.
'This has done a great deal of damage to all the EU fleets, including ours,'
says Mr Espell. 'For me it represents a kind of social dumping. Under EU
regulations we must pay minimum salaries and guarantee other kinds of
benefits, but certain non-EU countries don't have those kinds of rules. That
allows them to sell their fish at a fifth of the price.
'I want to compete, but I cannot compete on that basis.'
