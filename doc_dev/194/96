<HEAD>Bombs Explode In Three Basque Bars; ETA Claims Responsibility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small bombs exploded today in three bars in
this northern Basque city, causing substantial damage but no
injuries, police said.
   The Basque separatist organization ETA claimed responsibility.
   The first blast occurred at 5:30 a.m. in the Balanza bar in the
Bilbao neighborhood of Ocharcoaga. A second explosion 15 minutes
later heavily damaged the Amaya bar in the nearby suburb of
Basauri. A third explosion occurred about 40 minutes later in the
La Corona bar in central Bilbao, police said.
   Police defused a fourth bomb in the International bar in Bilbao.
   In a telephone call to a local travelers aid office, a man who
identified himself as a member of ETA said the group planted the
four bombs. Police said the same person called them to tell them
where the fourth bomb was located.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
numerous bombings and shootings in Basque and Spanish cities,
killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil
Guard officers.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, has been seeking independence for three provinces in
northern Spain.
