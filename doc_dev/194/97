<F P=106> [Luis R. Aizpeolea report: "Autonomy Front Reopens"] </F>
  [Text] The autonomy front is reopening. On the eve of the 
meeting Felipe Gonzalez and Generalitat [Basque autonomous 
government] Premier Jordi Pujol will be holding in order to 
examine the turnabout in autonomy demanded by Catalonia, other 
"fast track" autonomous communities have reacted by demanding a 
new boost to autonomy. This is the case with the governments of 
Navarre, Andalusia, and Galicia, which are demanding new 
responsibilities, in some cases going beyond the autonomy 
statutes themselves. 
  The finishing touch to this scene will be provided by 
Galician Xunta [autonomous government] Premier Manuel Fraga, who 
will meet with Gonzalez Thursday [3 February] in order to 
present to him his single administration plan. The situation 
worries the government, which lacks a clear stance on the new 
autonomy avalanche. 
  The announced meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol to discuss 
the turnabout in autonomy in Catalonia and the central 
government's decision to transfer a package of 20 areas of 
responsibility to the Basque government has encouraged other 
"fast track" autonomous communities to demand another boost. 
Last week, the government of Navarre, whose premier is Juan 
Cruz Alli of the Navarrese People's Union (UPN), sent the 
government a document in which it proposed the reopening of 
bilateral negotiations to give its community new 
responsibilities. Navarre's list of demands recalls the most 
substantial part of the package of responsibilities demanded by 
the Basque government. The transfers demanded by Alli include 
official credit, the Social Security funding system, the 
National Employment Institute, and the means of the 
administration of justice. A spokesman for the Navarre 
government told this newspaper that the responsibilities 
demanded "are contained in the improvement of the fuero 
[regional law code]." 
  The letter sent by the Navarrese government coincided with 
the visit to Felipe Gonzalez by Socialist Manuel Chaves, the 
premier of the Andalusian junta. The autonomy responsibilities 
demanded by Chaves, who is pressured by imminent elections, 
recall some of the proposals that Pujol announced he will submit 
to Gonzalez at their next meeting. They include public health 
funding, the coastline, and the reform of the state's peripheral 
administration. 
  But the finishing touch is provided this week by Galician 
Xunta Premier Manuel Fraga, with his meeting with Gonzalez next 
Thursday. Although the meeting's purpose is the European 
surcharge on the milk quota, Fraga will explain to Gonzalez his 
single administration proposal. According to a Xunta spokesman, 
the single administration plan -- a drastic reduction of the 
state's peripheral administration, with the abolition of civil 
governors and the concentration of power in the autonomous 
governments -- "is virtually complete." 
  To this move that has emerged among the "fast track" 
autonomous communities must be added the move by a "slow track" 
community such as Aragon, whose premier, Socialist Jose Marco, 
has announced the completion of the reform of the autonomy 
statute for April. 
  The new situation that has been created worries the 
government, which, two years after the signing of the autonomy 
pacts -- which place the "slow track" communities almost on a 
par with the "fast track" communities and whose process of 
transfers is taking place now -- is seeing the autonomy process 
being reopened by the "fast track" autonomous communities 
without there being a clear stance laid down by the government. 
  Over the past few years, the government has expressed its 
concern at the "fast track" communities' persistence in making a 
normal procedure out of an exceptional procedure, such as 
delegating exclusive state responsibilities to the autonomous 
communities contained in Article 150.2 of the Constitution. The 
current demands of the Basque, Navarrese, and Galician 
governments have recourse to this procedure, which in the 
opinion of government sources goes beyond the autonomy statutes. 
  Last week, Socialist Manuel Chaves made some points after 
meeting with Gonzalez. He condemned effecting the autonomy 
process by boosting one or several communities, and demanded a 
"harmonious and balanced process" involving all of them. He 
advocates setting up a conference of the 17 autonomous 
government premiers as a way to organize the autonomy process, a 
proposal which has been repeatedly delayed by the premiers of 
Catalonia and the Basque Country, who are in favor of a 
bilateral relationship with the central government. 
  The government has not yet commented on the new boost for 
autonomy. A government spokesman transferred the responsibility 
for the debate to the Spanish Socialist Workers Party Congress 
in mid-March. On that occasion, a report from the Basque 
Socialists suggesting an individual autonomy strategy with 
respect to the nationalist parties and proposing making progress 
in the complicated problem being created between each autonomous 
community's singularity and the balance between all of them will 
be debated.
