SPAIN'S Socialist Prime Minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, unexpectedly won a
clear general election victory last night after establishing a lead of 18
seats over the conservative People's Party, with more than 90 per cent of
the vote counted by the early morning.
The socialist result stunned the PP, which had expected to beat the
socialists after one of the closest elections in the country's short
democratic history. Mr Jose Mara Aznar, the PP leader, conceded defeat just
after midnight in Madrid but, noting that the Socialists, in power since
1982, had lost their parliamentary majority, said: 'A new age has begun.
Socialist hegemony is over. Nothing will be the same again.'
Mr Gonzalez, expressing his 'infinite gratitude' for what will be his fourth
term in office, said that 'I want everyone to know that I have understood
the message' of the campaign, in which the Socialists were heavily
criticised for their indifference at public concern about a series of
financing scandals and rising unemployment.
According to an official count released by the Interior Ministry, with just
92.7 per cent of the vote counted, Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party had won
38.9 per cent of the vote and 159 seats, sharply down on the 175 it won in
1989 but well above the result being predicted by opinion polls in the last
few weeks.
The ministry's count gave the PP 141 seats, well up on the 107 the party won
in 1989. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether Mr Aznar, having failed
to fulfil the widespread conviction among PP supporters that the socialists
were ready to be felled, will survive at the head of the party.
Contrary to all expectations, the socialists appear to have attracted about
1m more votes than they won in 1989 even though the country has since sunk
into recession and in spite of an avalanche of corruption allegations
against the ruling party.
The overall left-of-centre vote may have increased slightly overall as the
communist-led United Left party won an extra seat to become the
third-biggest party in parliament, with 18 seats.
In spite of the socialist victory, the elections mark a watershed in Spanish
politics, as they break the young democracy's tradition of strong
single-party government since the first elections held under the 1978
constitution. 'The result reflects the reality of the country,' said Mr
Javier Arzallus, leader of the Basque nationalist party, the PNV. 'We have
returned to normal. The days of absolute majority are over and it is no bad
thing.'
The vote will probably lead to a coalition government of the socialists and
the conservative Catalan regional party, the CiU, and the PNV. The CiU won
17 seats, one short of its 1989 result, and the PNV held its five seats.
Mr Gonzalez has, however, also suggested in the past that if he were to win
160 or more seats he might consider trying to govern alone, with the tacit
support of the Basques and Catalans.
The strong showing by the socialists is certain to ease pressure on the
peseta when foreign exchange markets open this morning. Many analysts had
feared that a close vote would make forming a government difficult. Also,
the markets had begun to assume that a conservative government would cut
interest rates more quickly than the socialists.
Mr Gonzalez's lead is probably enough to allow him to govern for a full
four-year term, although he will need to be much more attentive to
conservatives' calls for greater fiscal restraint made during the past four
years.
