   Civil guards defused two more package bombs
in Spain Tuesday in what appeared a drive by Basque separatists to
unnerve the government following a breakdown in talks between the
two sides in Algeria.
   A bomb sent to Transportation and Communications Minister Jose
Barrionuevo was opened by a ministry employee but a faulty
triggering device kept it from exploding, officials said.
   Barrionuevo is a former interior minister who led the fight
against the Basque separatist group ETA for nearly six years.
   Earlier Tuesday, experts defused a package bomb addressed to an
army sergeant in a military mountain training school in the
Pyrenees.
   On Monday, a package bomb exploded at the same school, seriously
injuring another sergeant.
   No group claimed responsibility, but police blamed the ETA,
which has fought for 21 years for self-determination for Spain's
northern Basque Country.
   Two other package bombs were sent Monday and Friday, and one
maimed a high school gym teacher.
   On Saturday, eight bombs exploded along the railway line linking
Vitoria with Pamplona, causing heavy damage but no injuries.
