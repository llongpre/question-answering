<LEADPARA>  VINCENT Hammond, the latest monster from Dr. Frankenstein's lab, is facing
heavy odds if he hopes to build a lasting screen career out of his role in
Monday night's Fox network movie, "Frankenstein: The College Years.";   Dozens
of actors have played the monsters of Frankenstein since Charles Ogle, a
member of Thomas Edison's acting stock company, was picked to play the first
of them in a 1910 silent version of "Frankenstein," a film that no longer
exists.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Few careers were enhanced by the role, including Ogle's. Though he can be
seen in a supporting part in at least one silent classic, "The Covered Wagon"
(1924), he is little remembered today.;   Some others who played monsters
created by Dr. Frankenstein without causing any noticeable stir: Percy Darrell
Standing ("Life Without Soul," 1915); Michael Gwynn ("The Revenge of
Frankenstein," 1958); Sally Todd ("Frankenstein's Daughter," 1958); Kiwi
Kingston ("The Evil of Frankenstein," 1964); John Bloom ("Dracula vs.
Frankenstein," 1971) and Nick Brimble ("Frankenstein Unbound," 1990).;   Only
one actor's career was truly "made" by playing the monster: Boris Karloff. His
name is still a synonym for horror and his flat-headed, bolt-necked look in
the 1931 "Frankenstein" -- created by makeup artist Jack Pierce -- remains the
prevailing image of the monster after 60 years of sequels, remakes, rip-offs,
sendups and even children's cartoons.;   Though Karloff was in 78 films before
"Frankenstein," he hadn't played a leading role on screen. His name had so
little value in 1931 that he was billed simply as "?" in the opening credits
of "Frankenstein." The role not only made the 44-year-old Karloff a
full-fledged movie star, but also launched him on a lucrative new career as a
horror actor that lasted the rest of his life.;   As Karloff told this
reporter 30 years ago, "I'm eternally grateful to the monster" for the career
he made possible, "but I'm sad to see what's become of him.";   Karloff was
talking about the Grand Guignol trend of the late 1950s, in which
Frankenstein's monster had been turned into either a shambling murder machine
with little personality or a stooge for such comedians as Bud Abbott and Lou
Costello.;   In the years since Karloff's remarks, the movies have given us a
handsome, articulate monster (Michael Sarrazin in "Frankenstein: The True
Story"), a black monster (Joe DiSue in "Blackenstein"), a number of female
monsters (Susan Denberg in "Frankenstein Created Woman," Jennifer Beals in
"The Bride," Patty Mullen in "Frankenhooker"), a cowboy monster (Cal Bolder in
"Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter"), even a sexually ambiguous
monster (Joe Dallesandro in "Andy Warhol's Frankenstein").;   But few have had
the distinct personality Karloff gave his monster in "Frankenstein" and two
sequels. His monster learned to talk, enjoy music and even smoke cigars before
turning really mean-spirited. That chance to act beneath the makeup may be why
Karloff's monster is so well remembered after so long.;   HERE'S a close-up
look at some of the notorious monsters of Dr. Frankenstein and the people who
played them:;   BORIS KARLOFF: The veteran screen heavy landed the part of the
monster in Universal's classic 1931 "Frankenstein" by default. "Frankenstein"
was originally envisioned as a vehicle for Bela Lugosi, who had just finished
"Dracula" for the studio, but Lugosi turned it down because the monster had no
dialogue.;   Director James Whale tested several actors before settling on
Karloff, who portrayed the monster like a puzzled newborn child trapped in a
grotesque body. His violence was provoked more by the torment he received from
Dr. Frankenstein's vicious assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), than from the
"criminal brain" mistakenly implanted in his skull by Dr. Frankenstein (Colin
Clive).;   Karloff played the monster only twice more on the big screen: "The
Bride of Frankenstein" (1935) and "The Son of Frankenstein" (1939), in which
he was jump-started by Dr. Frankenstein's son, Wolf (Basil Rathbone). He
played a mad scientist who revived the monster in "The House of Frankenstein"
(1944) and a descendant of Dr. Frankenstein in a 1958 cheapie, "Frankenstein
1970." (His monster was played by Mike Lane, best known as the boxer in "The
Harder They Fall.") Karloff put the monster makeup on one last time for a 1962
episode of TV's "Route 66." He died in 1969.;   ELSA LANCHESTER: While her
Oscar-winning husband, Charles Laughton, was playing Captain Bligh in "Mutiny
on the Bounty," Lanchester was playing the female monster created by Dr.
Frankenstein (Colin Clive) as a mate for Karloff's creature in "The Bride of
Frankenstein" (1935). Her electroshock hairstyle and birdlike screeches of
horror at learning she was intended for the gruesome Karloff made Lanchester's
monster the best among Dr. Frankenstein's experiments with women. Her later
work tended mostly to comedy. She died in 1986.;   LON CHANEY JR.: Creighton
Tull Chaney, the tall, muscular son of the silent screen's greatest horror
actor, reluctantly took his father's name shortly after he broke into pictures
in 1932 as a rough and ready action player in "B" movies and serials. He moved
up to star status after playing Lenny in John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" on
stage and screen.;   By 1941, Chaney began to make horror movies at Universal,
the same studio where his father played "The Phantom of the Opera" and "The
Hunchback of Notre Dame." Best known for creating the role of "The Wolf Man"
(1941), Chaney then played Frankenstein's monster in the first post-Karloff
picture in the series, "The Ghost of Frankenstein" (1942).;   In that film,
the monster was revived by Dr. Frankenstein's other son, Ludwig (Cedric
Hardwicke), given the brain of deformed killer Ygor (Lugosi) and went blind in
the final reel. His performance was not widely praised. Chaney reprised the
role in 1952 for TV's "Tales of Tomorrow" series. He later became a character
actor in films like "High Noon" and "The Defiant Ones," but also continued to
star in ever cheaper horror pictures. He died in 1973.;   BELA LUGOSI: By
1943, when "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" was released, Lugosi was 61, his
once promising career had faded and he was hurting for money to support a
growing drug habit.;   Lugosi finally kicked his drug habit in the early
1950s, but was a physical wreck when he finally died in 1956 at age 74 during
the filming of perhaps his worst of many bad movies, "Plan 9 From Outer
Space." (His part was finished by a double.) Though his Frankenstein monster
was a disaster, he remains the screen's most memorable Dracula.;   GLENN
STRANGE: The huge actor was mainly a bit player in westerns when Universal
picked him to play Frankenstein's monster in "The House of Frankenstein"
(1944), first of the "all-star" monster movies. His monster was revived by mad
scientist Boris Karloff, who also resurrected Dracula (John Carradine) and
tried to find a cure for the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney Jr.) before revving up Dr.
Frankenstein's equipment with the help of a hunchback (J. Carrol Naish).;  
Strange played the monster in two more films -- "House of Dracula" (1945) and
"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948) -- then toured the country as
Frankenstein's monster in live shows before finally finding the role he's
remembered best for today: Sam the Bartender on TV's "Gunsmoke," which he
played from 1956 until his death in 1973.;   CHRISTOPHER LEE: The imposing
English actor attracted little attention in films before he was cast as the
monster in "The Curse of Frankenstein" (1957), first in a long series of
horror movie remakes by England's Hammer studios. His grotesque, putty-faced
monster played second fiddle to Dr. Frankenstein (Peter Cushing), who returned
in a series of sequels with different monsters each time.;   Lee soared to
stardom the following year in "The Horror of Dracula" (1958), playing the
bloodthirsty count in his own series of sequels. Lee and Cushing became the
Karloff and Lugosi team of the 1960s. Lee continues to play grotesques, but
soon will be seen as Sherlock Holmes in a syndicated television special.;  
FRED GWYNNE: The 6-foot-5-inch theater-trained actor became a star in the TV
sitcom "Car 54, Where Are You?" in 1961, but is best remembered as Herman
Munster, one of Dr. Frankenstein's bigger mistakes, in the 1964-66 TV comedy
series "The Munsters." Revived in the 1980s with a new cast -- John Schuck is
the new Herman -- "The Munsters Today" continues in TV syndication. Gwynne has
played dozens of other roles in movies from "On the Waterfront" through "Pet
Sematary," but never has shaken the Munster image.;   DAVID PROWSE: The
towering Prowse made no waves as the monster in "The Horror of Frankenstein"
(1970), but became a favorite of kids everywhere a few years later as the even
more sinister Darth Vader in "Star Wars" (1977) and its two phenomenally
successful sequels.;   MICHAEL SARRAZIN: Surely the most handsome of all the
monsters, Canadian actor Sarrazin is mostly remembered for romantic roles in
films of the 1970s. But anyone who saw NBC's "Frankenstein: The True Story"
(1973) won't be able to forget Sarrazin as the suave, stylish monster of Dr.
Frankenstein (Leonard Whiting), who was utterly charming -- until he turned
violent and ripped a woman's head off. The role didn't affect the actor's
career much, but he has slipped out of view lately.;   BO SVENSON: Before he
became a leading man in action pictures such as the "Walking Tall" films,
Svenson walked even taller as Frankenstein's monster in a two-part 1973 TV
version of "Frankenstein" from producer Dan Curtis ("Dark Shadows"). His
monster was created by Dr. Frankenstein (Robert Foxworth) and given a bride
(Rosella Olson), but few memorable reviews. Svenson no longer plays leads.;  
PETER BOYLE: The bulky, balding Boyle became a star in the dramatic "Joe"
(1970), but proved he could play comedy in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein"
(1974), the best "Frankenstein" movie parody. Boyle remains one of our best
character actors.;   DAVID WARNER: The veteran British actor has played
abnormal characters from his early days in films like "Morgan!" (1966), "The
Omen" (1976) and "Time After Time" (1979), so it was no surprise to find him
playing the monster in "Frankenstein," a 1984 TV production that co-starred
Robert Powell, the same actor who played Christ in TV's "Jesus of Nazareth,"
as Dr. Frankenstein. (box)  </TEXT>
