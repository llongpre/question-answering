   ``Look Who's Talking,'' the comedy about love
and diapers, sold more than $11 million in tickets for the fourth
consecutive weekend, becoming only the seventh movie since 1982 to
do so.
   ``The Bear,'' the live-action drama about two bears being
pursued by hunters, jumped to second place with $5.1 million in its
second week of release.
   ``Look Who's Talking,'' starring Kirstie Alley, John Travolta
and the voice of Bruce Willis, has now made nearly $60 million,
according to figures released Monday by Entertainment Data Inc. and
Exhibitor Relations Co.
   During the past seven years, the only other movies to surpass
$11 million each weekend for a month were ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``The Return of the Jedi,'' ``Ghostbusters,''
``Beverly Hills Cop,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' and
``Batman,'' according to Entertainment Data.
   In third place in box offices revenues for last weekend was
director Wes Craven's ``Shocker,'' a story about a murderer who
more or less appeals his death sentence. ``Shocker,'' falling 26
percent from the previous weekend, reported a gate of $3.4 million.
   Woody Allen's melancholy comedy ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' sold
$2.7 million worth of tickets during a weekend of limited release
to finish in fourth place and become the director's biggest hit
since 1986's ``Hannah and Her Sisters.''
   In fifth was the new comedy ``Second Sight,'' with Bronson
Pinchot and John Larroquette co-starring as psychics, with $2.2
million. In sixth was ``Phantom of the Opera,'' starring Freddy
Krueger veteran Robert Englund, which debuted with $2.1 million.
   The Patrick Swayze adventure film ``Next of Kin'' was seventh,
grossing $2 million.
   ``Sea of Love,'' the romantic thriller pairing Al Pacino and
Ellen Barkin, was eighth with $1.8 million. In ninth was the
medical-school comedy ``Gross Anatomy,'' which collected $1.7
million.
   In 10th with $1.6 million was ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,''
starring Jeff Bridges and Michelle Pfeiffer.
