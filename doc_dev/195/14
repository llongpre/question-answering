LaToya Jackson, Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore and Kim Basinger led Mr. Blackwell's 
30th annual list of worst-dressed celebrities today, while praise went to Geena 
Davis, Liza Minnelli, Barbara Bush and Princess Diana.

The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at Princess Anne, Emily 
Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and gave a shared dishonor to Madonna 
and Sandra Bernhard.

<P>
Model-actress Grace Jones won "Fashion Fiasco of the Year" for an outfit 
Blackwell described as "Darth Vader's S-and-M fantasy in a bird cage." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a pop singer and sister of Michael Jackson, will be the "Cher for the 
'90s" who is "more fashion freak than biker chic . . . in leather and chains," 
Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Television's Barr was zinged as a "bowling alley reject," former brat-packer 
Moore was "a spandexed 'Nightmare on Willis Street' " and Batman's Miss 
Basinger was a "parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the Batcave."
