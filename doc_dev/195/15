<LEADPARA>  PARENTAL units and their contemporaries may want to skip "Suburban Commando"
(opening today), but kids should have a pretty good time with this sci-fi
action/comedy.;   A step up for star Hulk Hogan from the wrestling hit "No
Holds Barred," this amiable no-brainer pits Hogan's universe-saving
super-warrior, Shep Ramsey, against his greatest challenge: a vacation on
Earth.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "How about a big bug hunt with creatures that bleed acid?" Ramsey begs his
intergalactic superiors, when they tell him he's too stressed out. But nothing
doing. He's headed for suburbia, where he rents a house from unassertive
architect Charlie Wilcox (Christopher Lloyd) and his cheery wife, Jenny
(Shelley Duvall).;   Ramsey soon discovers that it's not easy being a hero on
a mad planet populated with litigious hot-rodders, talking car alarms and
mimes.;   The equally frustrated Charlie, whose only joy in life is mechanical
tinkering, quickly realizes that he's got Darth Vader for a tenant. Breaking
into Ramsey's stash of cool space gizmos, Charlie inadvertently alerts the
star warrior's enemies to his whereabouts.;   The writing here is beyond
scattershot, but that doesn't stop the movie from hitting a few good, satiric
bull's eyes. Part of this is due to the sure touch of the director, old
comic-action hand Burt Kennedy ("Support Your Local Sheriff").;   Lloyd also
deserves credit for some expert physical humor, and Larry Miller (who's
getting all the good notices for "Necessary Roughness") is a scream as
Charlie's conniving, glory-hogging boss.;   As for the Hulkster, well, he
knows how to play Hulk Hogan, and Ramsey is Hulk Hogan with warp drive. The
movie's goofs on his TV wrestler persona are about what you'd expect -- all
over-amped, misplaced aggression.;   Some attempts at softening up his persona
fall flat, too. But when push comes to shove, no one shoves like Hogan. His
underage fans should have no complaints.; Suburban Commando; (star) 1/2;
Rated: PG; Cast: Hulk Hogan, Christopher Lloyd, Shelley Duvall; Director: Burt
