   LaToya Jackson, Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore and
Kim Basinger led Mr. Blackwell's 30th annual list of worst-dressed
celebrities today, while praise went to Geena Davis, Liza Minnelli,
Barbara Bush and Princess Diana.
   The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at
Princess Anne, Emily Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and
gave a shared dishonor to Madonna and Sandra Bernhard.
   Model-actress Grace Jones won ``Fashion Fiasco of the Year'' for
an outfit Blackwell described as ``Darth Vader's S-and-M fantasy in
a bird cage.''
   Miss Jackson, a pop singer and sister of Michael Jackson, will
be the ``Cher for the 90's'' who is ``more fashion freak than biker
chic ... in leather and chains,'' said Blackwell.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
former brat-packer Miss Moore was ``a spandexed `Nightmare on
Willis Street,''' and Batman's Miss Basinger was a ``parading
peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Blackwell reduced Princess Anne to ``lumpy, dumpy and frumpy,''
Cher to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a sequined slingshot,'' Miss
Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on steroids,'' Miss Abdul to a ``fashion
gypsy (who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and
Madonna-Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy, trampy ...
and cartoon campy.''
   Joining the list of ``Fabulous Fashion Independents'' were Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Barbara Walters, Angela Lansbury, Tina
Brown, Ivana Trump and Jacqueline Onassis.
