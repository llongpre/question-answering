James Earl Jones, who plays a pool hall owner in "Third and Oak: The Pool 
Hall," has a pool table in his suburban home. He piles books on it. But, in 
case his 6-year-old son ever wants to learn to play, it's there. 
</P>
<P>
"Third and Oak: The Pool Hall," a three-character play by Marsha Norman, will 
be shown on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network Thursday (6 p.m. and 10 
p.m.) and again next Sunday. It's the first of four hourlong plays by Pulitzer 
Prize-winning playwrights to be shown on A&amp;E on the first Thursday of every 
month through February as "American Playwrights Theatre," a GM Mark of 
Excellence presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The play takes place in a run-down pool hall that Jones' character is preparing 
to sell. His best friend's son (Mario Van Peebles) stops by and what starts out 
as a casual chat turns to more intimate talk of secrets, promises, friendship 
and the high cost of loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Jones wasn't sure he wanted to play the character, saying he likes to 
portray people who are worthwhile. "That was the problem here. I had to accept 
he was a jerk. I'm playing not a villain but not a right guy. I had to readjust 
my thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the blind ones. I defined Troy Maxson in 'Fences' (Jones played 
Maxson on Broadway) as a man who didn't distinguish his principles from his 
prejudices. This is such a man. He seemed gratuitously racialist if not racist 
when it came to references to people outside his race, particularly to the girl 
who visits the pool hall. She is blond. She qualifies, in his eyes, for 
derision. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a problem with that. I don't like to promote gratuitous racialism at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
"I had to understand that white people had never meant anything good to him. He 
can't understand how on a romantic level they can mean something good to a 
young man he thinks of essentially as his son. He can't see genuine affection 
and love between people who come from different worlds. 
</P>
<P>
"My character, who's in a closed society, behaves as if he's a Mafia don. He 
expects obedience and the mantle to be passed." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mario Van Peebles (of the TV series "Sonny Spoon"), the cast 
features Debra Cole. 
</P>
<P>
The author, Marsha Norman, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for " 'night Mother." 
The other playwrights to be represented in the series are Eugene O'Neill, Paul 
Zindel and Tennessee Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has been around a long time, but he said that doesn't mean good scripts 
are going to come "flowing your way in excess. There are more good actors than 
good works." 
</P>
<P>
But the actor stays busy. He was a poet in the film "Field of Dreams," played 
civil-rights leader Vernon Jordan in the first installment of "Saturday Night 
With Connie Chung" on CBS and recently narrated "Ivory Wars," about African 
elephants, on the Discovery cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
He has made several movies, not yet released, since "Field of Dreams." "I have 
a 6-year-old. I have to keep working. I don't make multimillions per movie. I 
don't think anybody should, frankly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran actor was complimentary about the young crowd of actors coming up. 
"The young man who played my son in 'Fences,' Courtney Vance, is in 'Hamburger 
Hill.' It's on cable and I've seen it five times to see his scenes. He's a 
phenomenal actor. He ranks with young actors like Eric Roberts, Terence Booth, 
Alec Baldwin, Kevin Costner. They're strong without being macho bulls. They're 
strong as people." 
</P>
<P>
Jones next is going to Louisiana to play a man who runs a store in the movie 
"Convicts." The wardrobe mistress told him to bring clothes that he wore in 
"Matewan," which was about coal miners in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Some moviegoers recognized his voice as Darth Vader in "Star Wars," though the 
credits listed the actor inside the costume and helmet. Using his voice was an 
afterthought, after the movie was shot, Jones said. "I didn't feel it was 
proper for me to take credit. I had been a member of the board of directors of 
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences when Mercedes McCambridge's 
voice was in Linda Blair's body in 'The Exorcist.' 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to get involved with that sort of thing again. I denied it 
during the whole exposure of the first episode. I took credit in the third 
('Return of the Jedi') because I was going to be bumped off." 
</P>
<P>
When a criticism that black voices shouldn't be used for villains is quoted, 
Jones erupts. "That's a racialist point of view, as destructive, limiting and 
negative as racism is. I heard a lot of it. That's when black people who need a 
platform can't find anything better to talk about. That's embarrassing. There 
are a lot of really important issues and they had to light on that to talk 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, whose training was on stage, mostly acts in movies and TV now. "The 
energy factor gets more and more difficult. I'm not happy unless I have a role 
that's totally engaging. I commit for more than six months and I get burned 
out. If I did a small part I'd be happier, but I wouldn't be able to make a 
living from it. 
</P>
<P>
"So I will do less stage work, only special things and probably short 
engagements. I think my days of commercial theater are probably coming to an 
end. I'll go to pasture in movies and TV." 
</P>
<P>
But he won't retire. "When we stop doing, we stop being. Most actors can keep 
functioning till they can't walk any more." 
</P>
<P>
He says with a laugh that he's considering modifying his rich, deep voice for 
TV commercials. "I just finished doing the voice of a car. They wanted a kind 
of Darth Vader voice. I did enjoy doing those commercials. I will have to look 
for another road to do commercials. Maybe some squeaky voice. I don't know."
