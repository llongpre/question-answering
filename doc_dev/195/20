<LEADPARA>  SINCE it is the story of the moment -- how did the Julia Roberts-Jason Patric
"thing" happen, causing the cancellation of her wedding to Kiefer Sutherland?
OK, here's the hot inside skinny. She met him by accident on a plane when she
was taking her mother and her bridesmaids to the Canyon Ranch on the weekend
of June 8.;    There was a truly incandescent moment between Roberts and
Patric, said to have been observed with some foreboding and worry by the
entire wedding party. But the rest is history. And my insider says, "It's
very, very real!"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Hey, let's not wear black over this. Roberts was wise and sincere to call
off her wedding in such a case. Sounds like a scene right out of "The
Philadelphia Story." Canceled weddings and sudden revelations of true love
used to be epidemic in movie romances.;     REMEMBER HOW Winchell used to do
it (with the dots)? . . . Diana Rigg, the wonderful heroine of TV's "The
Avengers" and a really fine classical actress as well, has reconciled with her
producer-hubby, Archie Stirling. (She filed for divorce over his romance with
Vanessa Redgrave's daughter, Joley Richardson.) . . . Nat King Cole's
biographer, Leslie Gourse, will follow her "Unforgettable" book with one on
the life of the late Sarah Vaughan. "She was the Leontyne Price of jazz," sez
Gourse . . . They are talking look-alike Kurt Russell to play Pete Rose in the
movie of his life . . . Quincy Jones will be seen as a pirate in a cameo for
Steven Spielberg's epic "Hook," and the movie's star, Dustin Hoffman,
describes him as "the Darth Vader of this film." . . . Michael Jackson has
been vacationing with friends in Bermuda. He came and went from the legendary
Hamilton Princess via a private plane. While enjoying his R&amp;R, Jackson asked
for mopeds, snorkeling equipment, a hot-air popcorn maker and Nintendo games
in his suite.;    TV CHATTER: The talk of TV is Dena Kaye's hot new "A Sense
of Place" show on the Travel Channel. Everybody sits around letting down
his/her hair and chatting about the realities of glamorous destinations.;   
Kaye has snagged Gael Greene, Kitty Carlisle Hart, Ed Koch, Diane von
Furstenberg, Maud Frizon, Paloma Picasso, Walter Cronkite, Beverly Sills, Iris
Love, Anna Bulgari, Franco Ciarlo.;    Kitty Hart says: "Stop asking your
travel agent; just tune in 'A Sense of Place' if you really want to know the
best places to go.";    PARTY TIME: We have not seen the mighty media tycoon
Rupert Murdoch in these parts in some weeks, but he'll be the talk of the town
on Wednesday when he holds a posh party at Le Cirque's L'Orangerie to
celebrate his editor-in-chief, Grace Mirabella, and the magazine he created
and named for her.;    This does make it look as if the rumors are wrong that
Murdoch wants to sell or divest himself of Mirabella. And editor Amy Gross
just called to ask me to write several pieces for them. So I guess they are
not exactly putting on the brakes at Mirabella after all. Good thing; good
magazine!;    PEOPLE ARE TALKING about the parlay of Ali MacGraw and Julia
Phillips on the same London chat show, promoting their books about
disillusioned life in Hollywood. Although Phillips was quite abrasive, MacGraw
remained cool and articulate. Phillips tried to involve MacGraw in her
invective against the system, but the latter wouldn't rise to the bait.; From
Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;     STROKE OF BAD LUCK: Jack
Lemmon -- who loves golf more than practically anything -- has been forced to
bow out of the inaugural Jack Lemmon Invitational golf tourney in Pebble Beach
next month to honor his commitment to "Glengarry Glen Ross.";    The
big-screen adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Glengarry Glen
Ross" has been a pending project for Lemmon for quite some time, but has just
become a firm go for producer Jerry Tokofsky. Al Pacino and Alec Baldwin are
set to co-star with Lemmon -- and with at least a dozen other major actors
vying for the four remaining lead parts in the drama about a group of seven
shady real-estate development salesmen.  </TEXT>
