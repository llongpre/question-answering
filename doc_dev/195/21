<LEADPARA>  OFTEN I am asked which science fiction films I think are the best ever made.
That, of course, comes down to the question of what constitutes "SF" in a
film? Everyone has a slightly different definition. My own bias runs toward
plot and characterization rather than setting or set dressing.;    "Blade
Runner," for instance, is a visually brilliant film, but plot-wise it's just
an old noir detective film. "The Terminator" may feature time travel and a
robot, but those are just set dressing -- excuses for an action epic.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Most often I look for a philosophy -- a point of view that explores the
effect of science (real or imagined) on human values and relationships. And I
always look for a sense of awe or wonder.;    With these criteria in mind, my
nominations for the Top 10 science fiction films of all time (in no particular
order) include the following, all readily available on video:;    "2001: A
Space Odyssey" (1968; MGM/UA). Director Stanley Kubrick's visually stunning
but frustrating puzzle seems to be telling us that humanity is inseparable
from its tools: Before tools, we were apes; after transcending them, we become
something more than human. A Jungian philosophical treatise with enough
material to fuel endless debates as to "meaning," as well as a catalog of
numinous landscapes of physical and mental space.;    "Forbidden Planet"
(1956; MGM/UA). This prestigious, intelligent picture is a loose adaptation of
Shakespeare's "The Tempest." The otherworldly wonder, psychological plot,
eerie electronic score and truly awesome special effects still send shivers
through viewers.;    "Star Wars" (1977; CBS/Fox). OK, so it's only a big comic
book with cardboard cutouts as heroes. It's still the best space opera ever
recorded and wonderful fun. The trilogy changed the face of filmmaking and
rocketed SF to public prominence.;    "Aliens" (1986; CBS/Fox). The original
("Alien", 1979) had a novel look but was essentially a "killer in the house"
horror story. This sequel blended SF and horror to create one of the most
suspenseful films ever produced.;    "Back to the Future," parts I, II and III
(1985, 1989 and 1990; MCA). This ecstatic comedy series about the crisscross
temporal adventures of Marty and Doc is brilliant, down to the minuscule
details of plot, pacing, characterization, setting, special effects and even
props. Strangely, the most intensely sci-fi part of the trilogy -- Part II,
involving alternate time lines and a future as fully defined as that in "Blade
Runner" -- was the least popular.;    "E.T., The Extraterrestrial" (1982;
MCA). Yet to be surpassed by any SF film for emotional involvement, Steven
Spielberg's update of Peter Pan exposes us to awe, wonder, love, heartbreak --
and our own lost innocence. An affecting world-class film in any category.;   
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1980; RCA/Columbia). Spielberg again, in
a fledgling step toward crystallizing a world myth for the 21st century. This
suspenseful entry singlehandedly reversed cinematic portrayals of aliens from
evil bug-eyed monsters to wise, benign friends.;    "The Day The Earth Stood
Still" (1951; CBS/Fox). Science and reason are roundly trounced by fear and
force in this intelligent cautionary tale about the dangers of xenophobia and
anti-intellectualism.;    "Metropolis" (1926; Vestron &amp; Budget). A timeless
political metaphor, with effects still dazzling and unique today.;    "The Man
Who Fell to Earth" (1976; RCA/Columbia). David Bowie plays a convincing alien
in this strange, dark and artful film about human greed, insensitivity and
shortsightedness. A more positive choice, however, would be "Slaughterhouse
Five" (1972; MCA), Kurt Vonnegut's mystical vision thinly disguised as
"science fiction."  </TEXT>
