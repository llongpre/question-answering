   Police deployed a dozen patrol
cars and a helicopter in a late-night chase for a craft from outer
space, a police spokesman said Friday.
   The hunt, accompanied by dozens of calls from all over the Dutch
capital reporting unidentified flying objects, failed to yield
anything extra-terrestrial, according to spokesman Klaas Wilting.
   ``We were alerted late Thursday night by Schiphol (airport) air
traffic controllers who observed bright lights in a stationary
position over the port area which didn't show up on their radar
screens,'' Wilting said.
   After a radio newscast had mentioned the Schiphol sighting,
calls started pouring in from all over the city, describing objects
ranging from ``airplane-like things to fantastic contraptions with
Darth Vader at the helm,'' said Wilting.
   Around midnight, 12 patrol cars and a police helicopter were
involved, Wilting said.
   After several hours, ``we found nothing except some strong lamps
on top of a 50-meter (150-foot) high crane in the harbor,'' which
might have been visible from the airport's control tower, Wilting
said.
   ``We think it was a classic example of popular delusion, coupled
with a number of jokers trying to pull a trick on us,'' the
spokesman said.
