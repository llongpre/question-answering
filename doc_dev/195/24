   Mr. Blackwell, the acid-tongued clothes
critic who crusades against crimes of fashion, has placed singer
LaToya Jackson atop his most-wanted list, calling her ``Cher for
the 1990s.''
   And in case you think that's a compliment, think again. Cher
also made Blackwell's 1989 10 Worst-Dressed Women list, along with
eight other actresses, singers and a member of the British royal
family.
   ``In leather and chains, she's Cher for the 1990s,'' the
outspoken oracle of style said of Miss Jackson, who gained
notoriety when she posed nude for Playboy magazine. ``If I had her
face and body I'd stay in bed all day.''
   Blackwell also had unkind words about the sartorial splendor of
Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore, Kim Basinger, Princess Anne, Emily
Lloyd, Daryl Hannah, Paula Abdul and, in a tie for 10th, Madonna
and Sandra Bernhard.
   ``The finalists were a parade of terrors that make The Joker in
`Batman' look positively conservative by comparison,'' said
Blackwell. ``Ninety-nine percent of these people could be mistaken
for a baglady.''
   Blackwell reserved special dishonorable mention for singer Grace
Jones, whom he termed ``Darth Vader's S&amp;M fantasy in a martian
birdcage.''
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Selzer, held court
at his well-appointed Hancock Park home Wednesday to unveil the
30th annual Worst-Dressed Women list.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
former brat-packer Miss Moore was ``a spandexed `Nightmare on
Willis Street,''' and ``Batman'' star Miss Basinger was a
``parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Princess Anne was reduced to ``lumpy, dumpy and frumpy,'' Cher
to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a sequinned slingshot,'' Miss
Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on steroids,'' Miss Abdul to a ``fashion
gypsy (who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and
Madonna and Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy, trampy
... and cartoon campy.''
   While some have questioned Blackwell's fashion credentials, he
boasts that he formerly designed dresses for a distinguished
clientele, including Zsa Zsa Gabor and Marilyn Monroe, before
devoting full attention to his yearly list.
   ``I was a fashion designer with 450 accounts all over the world,
but I left it two years ago when the miniskirt came back,'' he said.
   Blackwell said he does the list so that ``people who want star
status don't make a mistake and copy'' the fashion frumps.
   After reading off the fashion rap sheet, Blackwell turned his
attention to a select group of woman he considers fashion paragons.
   His Top 10 list of Fabulous Fashion Independents included first
lady Barbara Bush, Geena Davis, Ivana Trump, Angela Lansbury,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Liza Minnelli, Barbara
Walters, Tina Brown, Princess Diana and Jacqueline Onassis.
   Blackwell said only two of his targets for disdain ever
complained _ Beatrice Arthur and Dinah Shore.
   ``They were furious,'' he said. ``But most of them love to make
the list. I never insult them as people. This is an observation of
what they look like to me.
   ``I adore many of them as performers,'' he said.
