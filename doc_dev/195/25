   With stock market confidence already shattered, some floor traders at the New York Stock Exchange are taking drastic measures to ward off further bad luck this Friday the 13th. 

   They are wearing hats. 

   Today is "Hat Day" on the exchange, and word has gone out that members must cover their pates -- or be prepared to suffer the consequences. 

   According to Arthur Cashin, a floor broker for PaineWebber Inc., the logic couldn't be simpler: As everybody knows, it's bad luck to wear a hat indoors; but since today is Friday the 13th, the reverse should hold true. 
So wear a Stetson, fedora, Yankees cap or bowler. 
Then, stand back and watch the bull market roar. 

   Maybe that'll happen, maybe not. 
On the most recent previous Hat Day -- it came on Nov. 13, 1987 -- traders showed up sporting everything from football helmets to women's straw hats, the price tags still attached. 
And with the October crash fresh in their minds, a surprising number of them kept their hats on throughout the day, hoping for one good session in an otherwise unnerving season. 

   Mr. Cashin went so far as to bring six hats to work that day. 
And in informal balloting for best hat, he won with what some traders thought was a Darth Vader mask. (Actually, it was a Korean helmet he picked up in a second-hand martial arts store. 
"It had leather drapings behind it, and all this great grillwork in front," he recalls.) 

   Meanwhile, John Lyden, the marketmaker in Duke Power Co. stock, opted for a combat general's hat with five stars on the front. 

   And both he and Mr. Cashin were among those who paraded through the exchange floor. 
Sure, everyone got to show off their headgear. 
But what they really wanted was a different kind of display. 

   Unfortunately, it didn't come, and by day's end the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 25.20 points. 

   Still, that hasn't much damped the traders' enthusiasm for today's event. 
And though not all of the Big Board's 2,700 floor traders and brokers will play along, a fair number will, including, of course, the redoubtable Mr. Cashin. 

   "I'll probably either wear a bowler, or this green homberg hat I bought in Jersey City," he says, adding, "I don't know if wearing hats really helps, but you feel better doing it."
