   Fashion critic Mr. Blackwell, who has ripped
into the wardrobes of celebrities for three decades, put LaToya
Jackson atop his worst-dressed roll Wednesday because he considers
her more freak than chic.
   ``In leather and chains, she's Cher for the 1990s,'' said the
outspoken oracle of style. ``If I had her face and body I'd stay in
bed all day.''
   The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at
Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore, Kim Basinger, Princess Anne, Emily
Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and, in a tie for 10th,
Madonna and Sandra Bernhard.
   ``The finalists were a parade of terrors that make The Joker in
`Batman' look positively conservative by comparison,'' said
Blackwell, a designer. ``Ninety-nine percent of these people could
be mistaken for a bag lady.''
   The year's uncontested fashion frump, however, was singer Grace
Jones: ``Darth Vader's S&amp;M fantasy in a Martian bird cage.''
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Selzer, held court
at his well-appointed Hancock Park home to unveil the 30th annual
Worst-Dressed Women list.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
actress Miss Moore, wife of actor Bruce Willis, was ``a spandexed
`Nightmare on Willis Street,'' and ``Batman's'' Miss Basinger was a
``parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Britain's Princess Anne was reduced to ``lumpy, dumpy and
frumpy,'' entertainer Cher to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a
sequinned slingshot,'' actress Miss Lloyd to ``a sweater girl for
Field &amp; Stream,'' actress Miss Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on
steroids,'' singer-choreographer Miss Abdul to a ``fashion gypsy
(who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and singer
Madonna-comedian Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy,
trampy ... and cartoon campy.''
   Blackwell, resplendent in a black double-breasted suit, also had
something good to say.
   His Top 10 list of Fabulous Fashion Independents included first
lady Barbara Bush, actress Geena Davis, Ivana Trump, actress Angela
Lansbury, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, entertainer
Liza Minnelli, television personality Barbara Walters, Vanity Fair
editor Tina Brown, Princess Diana and Jacqueline Onassis.
   Special barbs were aimed at Barbra Streisand and Bette Midler,
perennial Blackwell favorites who have been on his worst-dressed
list so often they are now lifetime holders of the dishonor.
   ``We don't have any star-status people anymore _ the Elizabeth
Taylors,'' he said. ``Poor Bette Midler, she's helpless. Why
bother? And Barbra Streisand, she's on some kick for visual
self-destruction.
   ``I don't know how she has a mirror in the house.''
   Blackwell said only two of his targets for disdain ever
complained _ actresses Beatrice Arthur and Dinah Shore.
   ``They were furious,'' he said. ``But most of them love to make
the list. I never insult them as people. This is an observation of
what they look like to me. I adore many of them as performers.''
   Blackwell also offered a dreary forecast for the 1990s.
   ``After a decade of glitz, it will be dull, boring and drab,
almost to a point where fashion will be mourning itself,'' he said.
The fashion future? ``Understatement is the trend for the 1990s.''
