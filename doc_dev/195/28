'CRASH TV,' NEW GAME-SHOW GENRE, SET TO GO 'BANG'

Like the creators of today's "trash TV" programs, the producers of a new crop 
of high-action game shows prefer to call their product "reality television." 
</P>
<P>
But, like it or not, the press has already dubbed them "crash TV" -- and the 
new "crash" genre debuts with a bang Sunday at 5 p.m. on KTLA Channel 5 with 
"The Interceptor," the first of three unconventional, high-impact entries into 
the game-show arena that are expected to appear next season. 
</P>
<P>
"The Interceptor," produced by Four Point Productions and distributed by Fries 
Entertainment, will premiere as a one-hour special on about 100 TV stations 
nationwide. The producers hope that if the pilot proves popular, stations will 
want to order "Interceptor" as a weekly series. 
</P>
<P>
Two other crash games, "RollerGames" from Qintex Entertainment and "The 
Gladiators" from Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment, are expected to premiere by next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of buying a vowel, picking a category, choosing Bachelor No. 2 or 
dressing up like a tomato to select Door No. 3, "crash TV" takes its players 
outside the safety of a studio set. In "RollerGames," skilled contestants on 
roller skates will do battle on a huge figure-eight track featuring a 14-foot 
"wall of death" and a live alligator pit. "The Gladiators" will throw ordinary 
weaklings into the fray with metal-clad warriors in costume. 
</P>
<P>
"The Interceptor," hosted by Erik Estrada, is probably the tamest of the trio. 
This game pairs contestants with celebrity guests, each carrying a large 
backpack containing information about possible prize winnings. Their quest: to 
find the keys to the backpacks while following a harrowing five-mile course, 
pursued by the Interceptor. 
</P>
<P>
In the pilot, the Interceptor is a stunt man dressed in black, with a Darth 
Vader-esque mask and voice, who amuses himself by hunting down the players via 
motorcycle, helicopter and on foot. 
</P>
<P>
His personality, voice and costume may change in subsequent games, said 
producer Ron Ziskin: "One week, he could be RoboCop -- the next, GI Joe, or the 
Lone Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
Contestants must make it to the end of the course without being "killed" by the 
Interceptor's gun. Once a contestant gets hit, the key will no longer unlock 
the backpack; the player goes home with a consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ziskin calls "Interceptor" reality television, the half-hour game is 
edited down from about two hours of film, shot by eight different camera crews, 
plus a camera placed in the Interceptor's helmet. The producers also added a 
throbbing music sound track to enhance the suspense, just as in a television 
drama. Ziskin argues that the editing does not affect the reality or fairness 
of the competition: "It's still the same game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ziskin believes "Interceptor" and the other crash TV games represent a response 
to the audience's restlessness with traditional TV formats. 
</P>
<P>
"What's more, the programmers themselves are kind of bored with today's 
programming. They're looking for new ways to create interesting television," he 
said. "It's an important program in that it is a new form, the first of this 
reality group to hit the air, fully executed. It'll be very interesting to see 
how it performs."
