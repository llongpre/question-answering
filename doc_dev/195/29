   After a year of open warfare, leaders of the cable television and motion picture industries are attempting to settle things at the bargaining table. 

   At a closed-door session Tuesday at Warner Communications Inc.'s New York headquarters, about 10 top cable and motion picture executives held the first of what participants said would be several meetings to resolve a wide range of public policy, programming and financial matters. 
These include copyright issues and the concentration of power in both industries. 

   Those at the session wouldn't discuss it, but sources familiar with the talks said they were initiated at the urging of Warner's chairman and chief executive, Steven J. Ross. 
Warner is the only major company that owns both a movie studio, Warner Brothers, and a large cable concern, Warner Cable. 

   Because of his dual interests, sources said, Mr. Ross didn't attend. 
Although Warner declined comment, Mr. Ross is known to have become increasingly concerned about the feuding between the two industries. 

   The meeting brought together for the first time some industry leaders who have communicated mainly by trading insults publicly. 
They included John Malone, president of the largest cable concern, Tele-Communications Inc., and Jack Valenti, the Motion Picture Association of America president who in the past dubbed Mr. Malone "Darth Vader" and referred to the cable industry as a "viral contagion" because of its growing concentration. 

   Troubles between the movie and cable industries began escalating last year after broad deregulation freed cable to raise prices to consumers. 
But the retention of other rules that favor cable led motion picture producers and others to charge that cable is now an unregulated monopoly. 
Cable executives, meanwhile, charge that a handful of Hollywood studios control the programming market and are trying to protect their own interests and not the consumer. 

   Both sides will come under scrutiny this spring when the House telecommunications subcomittee plans hearings on cable deregulation and other matters. 
Executives of both industries say that the group of cable and movie executives who met this week may be able to arrive at some compromises that will satisfy regulators. 

   Among the issues discussed, for example, is the copyright payments cable companies make to studios. 
A recent court ruling said cable operators may have to double their payments for carrying certain copyrighted television shows; industry executives are trying to arrive at a formula that would satisfy both sides. 

   Other cable operators at the meetings included Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of Time Inc.'s 80%-owned American Television &amp; Communications; Amos B. Hostetter Jr., chairman and chief executive of Continental Cablevision Inc.; National Cable Television Association President James Mooney; and Robert Miron, executive vice president of Newhouse Broadcasting Co. 

   On the movie side, the delegates at the New York meeting included Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive of News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox Film Co.; MGM/UA Communications Corp. Chairman Lee Rich; and Arthur Barron, who oversees Gulf &amp; Western Inc.'s entertainment operations, including Paramount Pictures Corp.
