   James Earl Jones, who plays a pool hall owner in
``Third and Oak: the Pool Hall,'' has a pool table in his suburban
home. He piles books on it. But in case his 6-year-old son ever
wants to learn to play, it's there.
   ``Third and Oak: the Pool Hall,'' a three-character play by
Marsha Norman, will be shown on the A&amp;E cable network on Thursday
at 9 p.m. EST, and again on Sunday, Nov. 5. It's the first of four
one-hour plays by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwrights to be shown on
A&amp;E on the first Thursday of four months as ``American Playwrights
Theater,'' a GM Mark of Excellence presentation.
   At first, Jones wasn't sure he wanted to play the character, he
says, since he likes to portray people who, whether or not they're
poor, are worthwhile. ``That was the problem here. I had to accept
he was a jerk. I'm playing not a villain but not a right guy. I had
to readjust my thinking.
   ``He is one of the blind ones. I defined Troy Maxson in `Fences'
(Jones played Maxson on Broadway) as a man who didn't distinguish
his principles from his prejudices. This is such a man. He seemed
gratuitously racialist if not racist when it came to references to
people outside his race, particularly to the girl who visits the
pool hall. She is blond. She qualifies, in his eyes, for derision.
   ``I had a problem with that. I don't like to promote gratuitous
racialism at all.
   ``I had to understand that white people had never meant anything
good to him. He can't understand how, on a romantic level, they can
mean something good to the man he thinks of essentially as his son.
He can't see shared genuine affection and love between people who
come from different worlds. He can't see she is as desperate as the
young man is and their desperation is very similar. They resolve it
without having a messy affair, as my character had been afraid.
   ``My character, who's in a closed society, behaves as if he's a
Mafia don. He expects obedience and the mantle to be passed.''
   Mario Van Peebles, star of the TV series ``Sonny Spoon,'' and
Debra Cole act with Jones.
   Marsha Norman won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for ``'night
Mother.'' The other playwrights in the series are Eugene O'Neill,
Paul Zindel and Tennessee Williams.
   ``Having been around a long time doesn't mean good scripts are
going to come flowing your way in excess,'' Jones says. ``There are
more good actors than good works.''
   But Jones stays busy. He was a poet in the film ``Field of
Dreams''; played civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in the first
``Saturday Night with Connie Chung'' docudrama on NBC-TV; and
recently narrated ``Ivory Wars,'' about African elephants, on the
Discovery Channel.
   He has made several movies, not yet released, since ``Field of
Dreams.'' ``I have a 6-year-old. I have to keep working. I don't
make multimillions per movie. I don't think anybody should, frankly.
   ``I like the young crowd of actors coming up. The young man who
played my son in `Fences,' Courtney Vance, is in `Hamburger Hill.'
It's on cable this week. I've seen it five times, to see his
scenes. He's a phenomenal actor. He ranks with young actors like
Eric Roberts, Terence Booth, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Costner. They're
strong without being macho bulls. They're strong as people.''
   Next, Jones goes to Louisiana to play the man who runs the
company store in the movie ``Convicts.'' The wardrobe mistress told
him to bring clothes he wore in ``Matewan,'' which was about coal
miners in the 1920s.
   Some moviegoers recognized his voice as Darth Vader in ``Star
Wars,'' though the credits listed the actor inside the costume and
helmet. Using his voice was an afterthought, after the movie was
shot, Jones says. ``I didn't feel it was proper for me to take
credit. I had been a member of the board of directors of the
Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences when Mercedes
McCambridge's voice was in Linda Blair's body in `The Exorcist.'
   ``I didn't want to get involved with that sort of thing again. I
denied it during the whole exposure of the first episode. I took
credit in the third (`Return of the Jedi') because I was going to
be bumped off.''
   When a criticism that black voices shouldn't be used for
villains is quoted, Jones explosively utters a barnyard word.
``That's a racialist point of view, as destructive, limiting and
negative as racism is. I heard a lot of it. That's when black
people who need a platform can't find anything better to talk
about. That's embarrassing. There are a lot of really important
issues and they had to light on that to talk about.''
   Jones, whose training was on stage, mostly acts in movies and TV
now. ``The energy factor gets more and more difficult. I'm not
happy unless I have a role that's totally engaging. I commit for
more than six months and I get burned out. If I did a small part
I'd be happier but I wouldn't be able to make a living from it.
   ``So I will do less stage work, only special things and probably
short engagements. I think my days of commercial theater are
probably coming to an end. I'll go to pasture in movies and TV.''
   But he won't retire, Jones says. ``When we stop doing, we stop
being. Most actors can keep functioning till they can't walk any
more. Spencer Tracy couldn't hear but kept functioning.''
   He says with a laugh that he's considering modifying his rich,
deep voice for TV commercials. ``I just finished doing the voice of
a car. They wanted a kind of Darth Vader voice. I did enjoy doing
those commercials. I will have to look for another road to do
commercials. Maybe some squeaky voice. I don't know.''
