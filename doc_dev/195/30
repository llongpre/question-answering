   A Wisconsin machinist celebrated his 33rd
birthday by quitting his job.
   But Tom Hall didn't make a rash decision _ at least not for
someone who won a $20 million lottery jackpot as a birthday
present, the second-largest lottery winning ever in Illinois.
   ``I am very, very happy, absolutely overwhelmed,'' Hall said
Tuesday.
   ``I took a personal day off work today, but I guess by tonight
they will realize I won't be going back to work,'' said the Racine
resident, who drove to Chicago with his father and lawyer to
present officials with his winning ticket from Saturday's 6 of 54
Lotto drawing.
   The windfall will not only allow him to quit his job, which pays
$9 to $10 an hour, but will give him more time to enjoy his
favorite pasttime, fishing. And it may lead to a new marital status.
   ``I realize this might change,'' the bachelor said.
   Hall said he wasn't yet sure how he would spend his winnings,
which will be spread over 20 years.
   He said he has played the Illinois lottery since it started in
1974, driving about 20 miles across the state line to buy $15 worth
of tickets every week. Wisconsin is starting its own lottery this
year.
   The largest single prize in the Illinois lottery was a $40
million payout in 1984.

   Down a dirt road, in the middle of a cow
pasture, people rummage through piles of clothes covering an acre
of land.
   But where did the clothing come from?
   ``Like the old saying, that's my business and not yours,'' said
Lee ``Red'' Wright, who owns the farm where the clothes are stored.
   Bargain-hunters climb atop the mounds of clothes that have been
piled in the pasture for about three weeks. They pay $5 to park,
then may haul off all the clothes they want for free, Wright said.
   Some said they found bargains, others said it was ``all junk.''
   Wright had little to say.
   ``It's good for people that's not too peculiar about what they
have,'' he said.
   He said he expects more shipments of clothes soon.
   ``There's some that's got tags on them. Whether they're new or
not, I don't know,'' he said. ``That's for you to judge for
yourself. I don't know, but they're good clothes, they're real good
clothes.''
   Anson County Sheriff Tommy Allen says he's been swamped with
questions, and is investigating.
   ``He's getting so much publicity that if it's not on the level,
he's sure enough going to have some problems,'' Allen said.

   After listening to a well-rehearsed pitch
from more than 100 schoolchildren, a House committee unanimously
approved legislation naming a long-extinct creature as
Pennsylvania's official state fossil.
   Armed with posters, a skit and speeches, second graders from
Valley Elementary School in Bensalem lobbied the House Committee on
Conservation to approve legislation Tuesday naming the phacops rana
as the state fossil.
   ``Phacops rana were kings of the ocean floor millions of years
ago,'' said 8-year-old Nicky Lepone, a spokesman for his 120
classmates.
   ``The phacops rana can be found in many areas of Pennsylvania,''
Lepone said, adding that the creature ``reminds us of Darth Vader
from `Star Wars.'''
   The committee passed the bill after committee Chairman Camille
George donned a scarf and sunglasses and toted an umbrella to help
the students demonstrate how fossils are formed by weather
conditions over millions of years. One of the children then
produced a fossilized phacops rana to show to the legislators.
   Teacher Tony O'Malley said his class discovered Pennsylvania
lacked a state fossil after a student heard a question about
another state's fossil on a television game show.
