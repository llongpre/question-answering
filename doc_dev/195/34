   AP Military Writer Susanne Schafer recently
traveled to Fort Hood with General Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of
staff, where elements of the 1st Cavalry and 2nd Armored Divisions
are preparing to ship out to Saudi Arabia. This is the second of
three reports.

   Staff Sgt. Connie Martens barked out the
chemical weapons drill to her two-dozen charges, sweaty young Army
soldiers swathed head to toe in thick, green and black protective
gear.
   ``Blister agent ... usually not fatal. Possibility of liquid
use. ... We have the M2-58A1. ... Hold your breath, grab your
M2-58A1. At that time you will start decontaminating your skin.
Once you decontaminate your skin, no problem!'' Martens told her
troops in rat-a-tat style.
   Some 15,000 soldiers from two armored divisions at this
sprawling Texas fort will soon trade its rolling hills for the
sands of Saudi Arabia. And Iraq's Saddam Hussein might be their
next instructor in the dangers of chemical warfare.
   So the soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division listened intently
to the petite sergeant with the booming voice - a chemical weapons
expert with 15 years of service - as they got themselves and their
gear ready to deploy.
   ``Blisters may begin to appear on your skin. ... Don't pop the
blisters. If you break the blisters, you have the secondary problem
of infection. You don't want infections out there, so just keep 'em
covered like you've always been trained, like a normal burn
casualty and you won't have a problem. Any questions?'' she asked.
   ``Yeah, I've got a question,'' a voice sounded from the side of
the huddle. ``What's the standard for putting on a protective
mask?''
   Backs stiffened and eyes widened as a big-shouldered four-star
general in jungle green and brown fatigues worked his way to the
front of the group.
   Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of staff, had come to see
whether his troops were getting the proper training before being
sent in harm's way.
   ``Who knows?'' Vuono shouted at the group, soldiers who'd rarely
been quizzed by a multistar general, let alone the Army's top
commander.
   ``Nine seconds!'' came a chorused reply.
   ``So what's the signal?'' Vuono asked. Without waiting for a
response, he then boomed out: ``Gas! Gas! Gas!''
   Ripping their black headgear from their belts, the soldiers
squeezed their eyes shut add held their breath as they struggled to
place the heavy goggles and plastic cover over their heads.
   A few wouldn't have made it in time. Most did.
   ``Not bad, not bad,'' Vuono said, checking his watch. ``Let's
try it again. Put 'em back!''
   As a few men started to remove their clumsy headgear, the
muffled sound of ``Negative, negative'' emerged from the under the
Darth Vader-like hoods.
   Vuono beamed with delight - the soldiers had refused his order
because he'd not given the proper command ``All clear.''
   ``Well done! Well done! I tell you, Tilleli, I'm proud of these
guys!'' Vuono shouted to their commander, Maj. Gen. John Tilleli
Jr., who stood nearby.
   Leaning on his brown and green cane - the general had recently
undergone hip surgery so his staff had covered his hospital-issued
yellow cane with camouflage tape - Vuono told the soldiers they
were going a long way from Fort Hood, to a place much hotter than
Texas.
   And they also might have to go up against an opponent who has
used chemical weapons before.
   All hoods and goggles were still, trained on the general.
   ``I don't know whether he'll use them, I don't know whether
we'll fight him. All I do know is, I don't want any soldier going
to Saudi Arabia that isn't well trained,'' the general said.
   ``We're damn proud of each and every one of you, and we wish you
all the best and Godspeed as you deploy on Desert Shield,'' Vuono
said, saluting. ``Good luck. Good job.''
   ``Tet-Hup!'' came the command. As Vuono strode away, the
rubberized soldiers stood at attention under shade of the scrub
oak.
   Then with the speed of a bullet, Sgt. Martens was spouting her
commands again, getting her charges ready to move through the
training booth that simulates a chemical weapons attack.
   ``All right men, move to the next area, move to the CS area. If
you have any contacts, make sure you get 'em out. We don't want to
make you cry. Just a safety precaution, get 'em out.''
