<LEADPARA>  UNDYING devotion to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a mystical thing, a
thing difficult to put into words. Just ask any kid who cajoled his or her
parents out of $17.50 for a ticket to the Turtles' Saturday shows at the San
Jose Center for the Performing Arts.;    Why do they feel such a strong bond
to the four dudes from the New York City sewers?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I don't know," says Blake Spiers, 6 1/2, of Salinas.;    "I don't know,"
says Mina Mousavi, 5, of Foster City.;    "Gee, I don't know," says Christin
Wood, 10, of Scotts Valley.;    "Because they're green?" asks Suzie Ramsour,
9, of Gustine.;    Excellent answer, Dudette!;    Suzie was one of hundreds of
three-foot tall humanoid ninjas who careened around the red-carpeted halls of
the CPA, which was about three-quarters full for the San Jose stop in the
Turtle's 40-city rock 'n' roll tour.;    The kids waved plastic Ninja swords.
They swung plastic Ninja "nunchuckas," two lethal looking bars connected by a
chain. Considering that everybody under age 10 was half-blinded by Ninja
masks, a Lone Ranger-like affair that tended to get its eye holes off-center,
it's a wonder more of the adults didn't end up in the bathrooms at
intermission, nursing bruised shins.;    Suzie's mask was orange. Why?
"Because I like Michaelangelo." Why? "Because he likes to spin around on his
shell.";    All right!;    It was Michaelangelo, after all, who allegedly got
the idea that he and his three mates -- Leonardo, Rafael and Donatello --
ought to branch out into the music business. Being Saturday morning cartoon
crime fighters, stars in their own feature film and the merchandising
sweethearts of everything from Ninja Turtle lunch boxes to Ninja Turtle
underwear was not enough. Music, the Turtles explained, is where it's at,
dudes and dudettes.;    Despite the brisk business in swords and nunchuckas
out in the lobby, the Turtles told their audience up front that violence is
not their way. At least, not unless their shells are really against the wall.;
   Sure, once during the show they inflicted some rough stuff on their arch
nemesis Shredder, a cross between Darth Vader and a top-of-the-line Osterizer
with the best maniacal laugh in the business.;    Shredder was on hand to
spice things up in case the tiny ninjas needed a story line between the
Turtle's songs. So was April, the shrill television reporter who documents the
Turtles' every move. It was April who fell into the clutches of Shredder, who
planned to rid the world of music with his "deharmonic convergence" machine.; 
  Between trying to rescue April and returning music to the world, the Turtles
managed to perform a number of songs off their album, which sold two million
copies within three months of its release last fall.;    The Turtles
good-naturedly took a stab at everything -- surfer music, ballads, even rap
with "M.C. Angelo" -- and somehow, they managed to sing and play their guitars
while going through choreographed moves that would test the skills of Paula
Abdul, especially if she were wearing a couple of dozen pounds of Turtle
suit.;    There were even some jokes for the parents thrown in. Band leader
Michaelangelo can't stop himself from saying, "Thank you! We love you! Thank
you!" long after the applause has stopped, ala '70s rock stars. He is
possessed by the spirit of Elvis Presley, and there's even a sly mention of
the real Turtles, the ones from the '60s.;    The production was a high-tech
one, too, with plenty of puddles of green and purple light for the Turtles to
dance into and out of, huge banks of television monitors on both sides of the
stage, and a sound system that boomed out Turtle music so clearly you could
almost always make out the lyrics, just in case the five-year-old beside you
wasn't screaming along.;    But, when it was all over, what was Suzie
Ramsour's favorite part?;    "When April lost her voice.";    Yeah. That was a
good part.  </TEXT>
