<TEXT>   IT'S midmorning on the set of CBS's "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," the film
is rolling and we find Rosie, played by double Emmy winner Sharon Gless,
positively radiating happiness as she flirts over the telephone with her new
boyfriend.;   Obviously, things are looking up this season for the usually
unlucky-in-love and much put-upon public defender. Or are they?;   Suddenly,
an ominous bulk looms in the doorway of Rosie's office and her smile instantly
wilts as she looks into the surly puss of . . . Ed Asner?;   That's right, the
seven-time Emmy-winning star of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Lou Grant" and a
slew of other shows has joined Rosie's team this fall as her official
tormentor, starting with tonight's season premiere of "The Trials of Rosie
O'Neill," which introduces Asner as ex-cop Walter Kovatch, new investigator
for the Los Angeles public defender's office.;   "I'm like Ollie North doing
community service," says Asner about the role. "Kovatch has no time for public
defenders. He thinks they're full of crap most of the time, always pushing to
put the wrong people back on the street.";   And, since Rosie O'Neill is the
living embodiment of "bleeding heart" legal liberalism, Asner's character is
her personal Darth Vader.;   "As I see it," he says, "my job is to keep
popping her balloon.";   Which is exactly what he was doing that morning, over
and over again in take after take as Kovatch turns in a startling
investigation report that wins Rosie's grudging admiration.;   "Keep this up,
Kovatch," says Rosie, "and I may have to pay you a compliment.";  
"Considering the source," he snarls, "who cares?";   If Rosie O'Neill were
Mary Richards, that would be the cue for her to groan: "Oh, Mr. Grant!" But
Rosie O'Neill has been insulted by the best, so she just shakes her head sadly
as Kovatch exits rudely.;   "I love taking the potshots," Asner explains a few
minutes later in his motor home/dressing room, the air conditioner turned up
to max in a futile attempt at relief from the 100-plus-degree heat outside.
For those who remember how "mean" he used to be to poor Mary, Asner promises,
"they ain't seen nothin' yet. Lou Grant was a marshmallow compared to this
guy.";    It may seem strange to some that Asner has signed on for what's
clearly a supporting role in "Rosie O'Neill." Asner moved up to leading roles
in 1977 when his Lou Grant character was spun out of "The Mary Tyler Moore
Show" into a show of his own. He remained in starring roles in his two
subsequent shows, ABC's "Off the Rack" and NBC's "The Bronx Zoo.";   Asner
doesn't see it as any kind of comedown. He has always been a character actor
and he believes Kovatch is a priceless character, even if he isn't the star of
the show. He thinks Kovatch is comparable to Ves Painter, the colorful and
thoroughly obnoxious character the late Warren Oates played on ABC's 1962
"Stoney Burke" series.;   "He was a scumbag who was selling out his friends
week after week," Asner recalls. "Warren played him admirably.";   Asner also
reminds us that the "workhorses" of his "Lou Grant" series were "Rossi"
(Robert Walden) and "Billie" (Linda Kelsey), not the Lou Grant character.;  
"It was only his aura that worked," says Asner. "More often than not, I'd work
just three days out of a seven-day schedule.";   It's also widely believed
that Asner is being handsomely compensated for coming into "The Trials of
Rosie O'Neill" at the behest of Jeff Sagansky, president of CBS Entertainment,
to help the show fight what's expected to be a brutal ratings battle against
NBC's 9 o'clock show, "Cheers," TV's No. 1 prime-time show last season.;  
"It's nice to be thought of as the star of the show, the numero uno," says
Asner, "but I have all the other perks for doing this.";   Barney Rozensweig,
executive producer of "Rosie" and Gless' real-life husband, had wanted to
bring Asner into the show when it began last season, but the deal couldn't be
put together. He always saw the dramatic potential in giving Rosie a
high-profile adversary like Kovatch.;   Yet there may be still another reason
why Asner came to terms this fall. His last two prime-time series were flops
and Asner freely admits his outspokenly liberal politics and his
controversy-plagued duty as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in the
1980s have hurt his chances for roles.;   "I wound up embroiled in some
terrible controversies that cost me," Asner says.;   (Among them: His
outspoken criticism of U.S. support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, which
provoked feuding within the union membership, and his tough line on labor
negotiations.);   "Last year was not a good year," he admits, not in terms of
earnings, recognition, nor "the people who will take my calls.";   Though he
says his season of public activism is "over and done with now," Asner still
believes he gained more than he lost by becoming a union leader in the 1980s.
He isn't at all bitter about the lingering impact on his career.;   "The
education I've received in the last 10 years has been so priceless, so
magnificent," he says. "I wouldn't take a million dollars to go through it
again, but I wouldn't take a million dollars to (erase) it either. It has
given me such honor that it was more than worth it.";   Still, there's a
certain humor in finding such a well-known liberal as Asner playing a
reactionary character in a weekly drama with as liberal a bent as "The Trials
of Rosie O'Neill." Asner also finds it amusing -- and hopes there'll be no
effort to "warm" up Kovatch or turn him into something "nice.";   In the
story, Kovatch joins the public defender's office essentially as a condition
of probation after he leaves the police force, gets into trouble and winds up
in jail, being defended by, of all people, Rosie O'Neill. Naturally, she wants
to redeem him by putting him to work in her office.;   Though he'll never grow
fond of Rosie, Asner says Kovatch probably is "developing an awareness of her
fumbling efforts to do right.";   And if his Kovatch character can help
increase the public's awareness of "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" at the same
time, says Asner, "he'll be doing just fine."  </TEXT>
