Tomorrow's men's singles final of the 114th US Championships at the National
Tennis Centre, Flushing Meadow, will produce a new champion. That much, at
least, is certain at the end of a fortnight when upsets have abounded. Who
we shall be hailing as he holds aloft the famous silver cup and pockets a
cheque worth Dollars 550,000 is difficult to predict.
In today's semi-finals, the 1991 Wimbledon champion, Michael Stich of
Germany, seeded No 4, will play unseeded Karel Novacek of the Czech
Republic, ranked 56, in the top half. In the lower half, Andre Agassi,
unseeded for the first time since 1987, will play fellow American Todd
Martin, seeded No 9.
When Jaime Yzaga beat Pete Sampras, the defending champion, on Tuesday it
meant that for the first time since tennis went open in 1968, only three of
the seeds had reached the quarter-finals: Stich, Martin, and the left-handed
Austrian, Thomas Muster (13). Once again, the growing depth in the men's
game was apparent.
The carnage had begun early. Wimbledon finalist Goran Ivanisevic (2) fell at
the first hurdle to the German giant Markus Zoecke whose serve is nearly as
big as his own. 'Maybe it's a brain injury. As soon as I come here it is
finished. It's not a problem with New York, it's a problem with me,' said
Ivanisevic.
Boris Becker (7), also lost in the first round, beaten by America's Richey
Reneberg. The 1989 champion was disappointed. 'I thought I had a good
chance,' said Becker. 'But it was extremely slow this year - both the court
and the heavier, softer balls.' Almost as slow as Becker himself, one might
have added.
Another former US Open winner, fifth seeded Stefan Edberg (1991, 1992), fell
in the third round to fellow Swede and frequent practice partner, Jonas
Bjorkman. The match was played at night in the same cold, windy conditions
that had prevailed when Edberg lost to Aaron Krickstein in 1988. Thus, for
the first year since 1986, Edberg has failed to reach a Grand Slam final. He
was the victim of his own frailty on serve and an inspired piece of
attacking play from Bjorkman who had given notice of his advance by beating
French Open champion Sergi Bruguera two weeks ago in Schenectady.
Bruguera had performed well at Flushing Meadow until he was hammered into
submission by Muster in the fourth round.
Michael Chang, the sixth seed, believes that he is at his best on the
surface. He proved it, too, in one of the best matches of the tournament
when he faced Agassi in the fourth round. It was a full-blooded contest. The
quality of shot-making from both men was remarkable, the result a tonic for
a sport that badly needs the survival of characters like Agassi.
If, at times, Agassi's sinister black cap, black, white and blue striped
shirt, plus black socks and shoes, makes him look more like Darth Vader than
a tennis player as he darts about firing bullets from his light-sabre of a
racket, one can still admire his astonishing timing and his courage in going
for his shots.
Whether Martin will be cast in the role of Luke Skywalker this afternoon
remains to be seen. Certainly the tall, upright, all-American boy has done
well to survive after saving three match points against Guillaume Raoux of
France in the first round. He is carrying a groin injury that inhibits his
movement and is playing well below the form that took him to the final of
the Australian Open in January and the semi-finals at Wimbledon. Yet he will
start as favourite. Martin has won three of his five matches against Agassi.
At a time when the age eligibility rules for women are being redefined to
protect the young from burn out and exploitation, Steffi Graf, herself an
infant prodigy when she began, will be defending her title today against the
22-year-old from Spain, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. The great rivalry that is
developing between these two - Graf leads 24-7 but has lost two of their
last three meetings after holding match points in both - is about the only
thing that is holding the women's game together. Already, the shortage of
quality performers has brought a restlessness among the tournament promoters
and some of the leading players. Together with the International Management
Group they are proposing a revamped circuit with fewer tournaments.
