<LEADPARA>  THE PRICES of stylish sneakers have already soared past $100. And now
sunglasses have joined them on the high-profile, high-priced stage.;   You
know the type, the spaceman, wraparound kind no drug store seems to have in
stock. From Rickey Henderson of the A's to the 14-year-old down the street,
Darth Vader-type sunglasses are in.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sports specialty-shop managers say they sell as quickly as they can be
stocked.;   It's not just Henderson and his baseball pals who are wearing
them. It seems track and field athletes, skiers, cyclists, surfers and runners
all have gotten in the act.;   Although they sell for $70 to $130, a high
price doesn't guarantee safety or utility.;   "There are only two concerns
with sunglasses," said Dr. Ted Lawwill, an ophthalmology professor at the
University of Kansas and a member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
"One, will they break and cut your eye? The FDA has some control over that.
The second question is what kind of light it lets through.";   Invisible
ultraviolet light is the most damaging to the eye.;   "Light ages the eyes
just like it does the skin," Lawwill said.;   Here's what to look for when
purchasing sunglasses:;   (check) Check the label or manufacturer's booklet to
be sure that the sunglasses block 100 percent of ultraviolet light.;   (check)
Check the label or manufacturer's booklet to be sure that the sunglasses have
passed an impact test and are shatter-resistant.;   Kris Bowers, the
advertising director for Oakley, a company that makes the wraparound
sunglasses, said Oakleys offer 100 percent UV protection and that they are
made with polycarbonic lenses, a hard, plastic-like material.;   "There's no
way you could have a glass lens," she said. "If you crash or fall, you'd have
glass in your face.";   In addition to safety and fashion, consumers --
particularly cyclists -- are concerned about wind.;   "They want the wind out
of their eyes," said Mike Keyser, who works at a ski shop in Fremont and owns
a pair of the sunglasses. "In skiing it's the same idea.";   Because the
sunglasses' lens are wider and wrap around the face, wind is blocked.;  
"They're optically correct, too," Miller said. "There's no distortion. There's
no part of the lens that you can see. You get a full view.";   Bowers admitted
the shades have appeal because they have become fashionable, but she insisted
that they are more than just a fad.;   "It's not just a fashion statement,"
she said. "It's a piece of equipment. They're used by runners, snowboarders,
surfers . . . in almost any sport you can name, really.";   Other companies
produce high-quality sunglasses as well, but shop managers said Oakley's
shades are the most popular.;   "They're always coming out with new colors,"
said Steve Miller, the manager of a Newark bike shop and an owner of a pair of
Oakleys. "They don't sit on their butts.";   But there's one thing Miller said
he doesn't understand: why some people are willing to spend so much on a
product that used to go for less than 20 bucks.;   "I sometimes wonder why
people go out and spend $100 on them," Miller said. "But then women go out and
buy Gucci bags, so . . ."  </TEXT>
