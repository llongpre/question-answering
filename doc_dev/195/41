<TEXT>     These are 21 players from history who will win it for us.;   We're going to
need all 21 of them, because in hockey there's a constant shifting of
personnel -- players skate for a minute or so, then sit down for a short rest
while fresh troops take over.;   The game will be played in the sport's most
renowned arena, the Forum, in Montreal, the city where organized modern ice
hockey began (on Earth) on March 3, 1875.;   First unit. Center: Wayne Gretzky
(1978 to present). Easily the best player in the world in the 1980s; he's
fading just a bit now but is still well worth seeing in person. He's a slim
guy who always looks like he's going to get rubbed out by some ice gangster,
but he slips away and gets his revenge by scoring. Among his many gifts is his
exceptional eyesight -- his peripheral vision has been tested at 30 percent
better than average. Also, he has a gift for actually having fun out there.;  
Wings: Gordie Howe (1946-80) and Valeri Kharlamov (Soviet, 1960s-70s). Howe's
peak seasons came when Truman was president, and he was still scoring goals in
the year Reagan was elected. Kharlamov, at his best, was one of the two or
three top forwards in the world, but North American fans rarely got to see
him. This sort of thing will be happening less and less in coming years -- the
NHL today is getting lots of fine European and Soviet players; someday,
Soviets and Europeans will lead a team to the Stanley Cup.;   Defense: Bobby
Orr (1966-79) and Valeri Vasiliev (Soviet, 1970s-80s). An "offensive-minded"
defenseman is usually paired with a "defensive-minded" one. Orr refined the
concept of the offensive defenseman into an art. In his best years, he
regularly took the puck in his zone, in the space behind his goalie, and made
magnificent rink-length solo rushes to score. No one could touch him because
he was so fast and shifty. He also was a skilled passer. And he was no slouch
as a defender. Vasiliev excelled at the most important job of the defensive
defenseman -- dominating the few square yards of space directly in front of
his goalie, the key defensive combat zone, where no prisoners are taken.;  
Goalie: Jacques Plante (1952-73). Great during the regular season and better
during the playoffs.;   Second unit. Center: Howie Morenz (1923-37). Wings:
Maurice Richard (1942-60) and Mike McPhee (1983-present). Three great
forwards; also, three great Montreal Canadiens -- and since we're playing in
the Forum, we want the crowd inflamed. There is nothing in sports like the
sound of 16,197 Quebecois cheering for their heroes.;   Defense: Viacheslav
Fetisov (Soviet and NHL, 1970s-present) and Eddie Shore (1926-40). Shore was
the Ty Cobb of hockey -- extremely cranky, and unsurpassed.;   Third unit. In
many games, it's the play of "special teams" that makes the difference: the
"power play" unit (when our side can put more skaters on the ice than theirs,
because one or two of their guys have been sent to the penalty box) and the
"penalty-killing" unit (when we've been penalized). For our power play, we'll
draw from the first two units, above. For our penalty killers, we choose:
Forwards: Bob Gainey (1973-89), who rarely scored a goal but was one of the
best defensive-minded forwards ever; and Mario Lemieux (1984-present), today's
premier player, for the Penguins, whose breakaways while killing penalties
(where he steals the puck and storms down the rink all alone) are feats of
beauty and scholarship. Defense: Doug Harvey (1947-69) and Ray Bourque
(1979-present).;   Back-up goalies: Vladislav Tretiak (Soviet, 1970s-80s) and
Frankie "Mr. Zero" Brimsek (1938-50).;   Bench strength. Anatoli Firsov
(Soviet, 1960s-70s); Bobby Hull (1957-80); and Bobby Clarke (1969-84). Also,
designated fighter Dave Schultz (1971-80), because as long as the league
allows fighting, we'd better get on the bandwagon and have a thug we can call
our own.;   Coach: Herb Brooks, who in 1980 revolutionized the game by
combining two styles of play -- North American grittiness and European
creativity and finesse -- to produce the gold medal-winning U.S. Olympians.
Adviser: Soviet pioneer Anatoli Tarasov.  </TEXT>
