   They may not rank up there with the works
of Picasso or Matisse, but Michael Angelo Vidal Jr.'s Etch-A-Sketch
masterpieces are drawing rave reviews at the Burbank Central
Library.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Michael Lewis as he gazed at an
elaborate drawing of a knight battling a scaly dragon outside a
brick medieval castle. ``I've been doing Etch-A-Sketch since I was
little and all I can draw is a face.''
   While the art world reels from an insatiable demand for big-name
creations such as ``Yo Picasso,'' the self-portrait which recently
sold for $47 million, the visionary Vidal is plotting a new
artistic course.
   Equipped with a standard toy-store-issue Etch-A-Sketch, Vidal
meticulously moves the horizontal and vertical knobs on the red
5-by-7 inch ``magic screen'' filled with metallic powder.
   Soon, Voila! The little black squiggle that has kept kids quiet
in the back seat for three decades becomes another Vidal Original.
   Michael Angelo Vidal (and that's his real name) wasn't always an
accomplished Etch-A-Sketcher.
   ``It was always easy for me to draw complicated work. I thought
I could get into any medium _ pencils, paint, oil. But here was
this Etch-A-Sketch and I couldn't get it to work for a darn,'' said
Vidal, 38, of Burbank.
   But the freelance carpenter and artist mastered the
Etch-A-Sketch so it now takes him 15 minutes to draw a portrait,
although up to 25 hours for a more complex work. He said he has
bought several hundred of the toys over the years, and several of
the drawings on display are more than a decade old.
   ``I've sold several pieces of artwork _ anywhere from eight to
10 of them _ mostly to friends and acquaintances,'' he said.
   ``It's unique. I get more response out of this medium. You have
to use two hands to use this. It's a toy, and everyone is aware of
this toy. And I can carry it with me.''
   Although his pictures of a housing development, reptiles, the
Beatles and Darth Vader haven't yet made it to the Louvre or the
National Gallery of Art, the sketchings are prompting open-mouth
amazement at the Burbank library, where they are on sale at prices
ranging from $200 to $5,000.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Bill Kahikina, repeating a common
utterance by viewers of the Etch-A-Sketch art. ``All I could do is
draw a square.''
   The etchings are exhibited flat in a glass case, propped up ever
so slightly because of the delicate nature of the toy. The board
erases when it is shaken or turned over _ a feature that's nice for
kids, potentially disastrous for Vidal.
   Once, he recalled, he had to brake sharply in his car and an
Etch-A-Sketch fell off the seat. ``It was a loss,'' Vidal said.
   Special care will be taken next month when the Vidal etching
collection is moved down the street for its next engagement at the
Brand Art and Music Library in nearby Glendale. Could the Los
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art be next?
   Etch-A-Sketch went on the market in 1960 for $2.98. It has
become one of the most popular children's toys ever, having sold
more than 50 million since its introduction and continuing to sell
about 2 million a year at its current $8.99 cost, said Lowell
Wilson, vice president of development and marketing for The Ohio
Art Co., which manufactures the toy.
   ``We're now into our third generation of Etch-A-Sketch. Mothers
bought them for their children and now those children are mothers
buying it for their children,'' Wilson said.
   Vidal is not alone in his hobby. Wilson said there is an
Etch-A-Sketch art club with 25,000 members. Most are children
between 3 and 10 years old, but there are also many adult members
who are accomplished etchers.
   ``These people are amazing,'' Wilson said. ``People have
detailed Mount Rushmore, detailed dollar bills. It's definitely an
art form.''
   Vidal couldn't agree more.
   ``There's a technique to it. It has great detail. You have to be
an artist to draw them,'' he said. ``I do consider it serious art.''
