<LEADPARA>  SURELY among the most idyllic-sounding addresses in the British Isles, 4 Great
Orchard Street, Gloucester, summons up a vision of a snug little blacksmith's
cottage in one of England's loveliest towns.;    Sadly, it is not. Grey,
rain-lashed and conspicuously on the wrong side of the tracks, this stretch of
decrepit Victoriana is now given over to stripping car wrecks.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Except for No. 4, from whose bowels may be heard a din quite the equal of
the enthusiastic metal-bashing echoing the length of the rest of the street.
It's the sound of Great Britain's latest pop sensation rehearsing -- a
sensation likened by Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant to the Sex Pistols, and a
sensation ripe for export to America.;    EMF is the name, a rock-dance
quintet determined to add theirs to the modest list of star names -- Brian
Jones is one -- who hail from this picturesque and therefore very un-rock 'n'
rollish nook of Olde Englande.;    The fast road up;  "It's got a bit of
history, Cinderford has, but it's more famous for EMF than for anything
before," says keyboardist Derry Brownson, 20, about their hometown. "We've
still got friends there, but we know for a fact that we don't owe them
anything. They've never done anything for us. We've given the town
everything.";    Standing for Epson Mad Funkers (Epson computers, that is,
heavily advertised on British TV), EMF has sprung from nowhere to
international success in just over a year. Formed in October 1989, the band
was signed to EMI Records the following May after being spotted at only their
fourth gig.;    Five months later, their debut single, "Unbelievable," went
British Top 5, followed by two more hits and now an album, "Schubert Dip."
What they're rehearsing for now is their tour. (EMF brings its show to San
Francisco Saturday, at the Warfield. On Monday, they will give a free concert
at Stanford.);    Like father, like what?;  Shrinking violets they ain't.;   
"My dad owned two nightclubs," Derry says, "and I remember my uncle playing
guitar in our living room when he was stoned out of his head. But my dad's got
no musical ability at all. And I don't think I have.";    Then there's
20-year-old bassist Zac (Zachary Sebastian Rex James) Foley (Derry: "I think
Zac's dad did a lot of acid in his hippie days. He's an artist, a pretty cool
bloke"), singer James Atkin, 22 ("His dad used to play banjo and guitar with
Miles of the Wonder Stuff's dad in a folk band"), and drummer Mark Decloedt,
21 (nondescript dad).;    At 26, guitarist Ian Dench is the band's musical
brains (daddy's a classical guitarist-turned-postman). Dench had quit his
previous band, Apple Mosaic, and was looking for something meatier when he ran
into this bunch a little younger than himself.;    Bad kids on the block;  "We
met halfway with our thrash and his melody," says Derry. "We clicked in our
first rehearsal." The origin of their punchy sound is a Casio SK-1
bottom-of-the-line sampler purchased from a local electrical shop, plus Ian's
mum's upright piano with a microphone crammed down the back. EMF's teeny-bop
appeal has catapulted them straight into the British tabloids, who've typecast
the group as naughty alter egos to those nice New Kids.;    The guys in EMF
are all too aware that such a reputation may leave them abandoned when the
teens have moved on, with a gap that an older rock audience may snobbishly
refuse to fill. "It's a thin line to tread between accessibility and
credibility," says Ian Dench. "If you look at our cross-section audience, I
think we've done pretty well.";    "We can all play," Derry declares. As if to
advertise their musicality, their album's title drops the name of the
19th-century Romantic composer of whom Dench is a buff. (It also puns on the
old-fashioned powdery-white British candy, sherbert dip, thus alluding to
"showbiz sherbert," as cocaine is often called by English rockers.);    And
proclaiming its rebel-rock credentials, the band occasionally torches and
trashes its gear at encore time. Hence the Pistols tag, which Tennant bestowed
after he saw EMF win over a beerglass-chucking audience in London.;    "Neil
turns up at the weirdest gigs," says Derry. "In he walks in his three-grand
overcoat, gliding along like Darth Vader. The crowd wasn't malicious -- they
were dancing away. I'd rather have them throwing glasses than teddy-bears and
knickers with 'I love Derry' on them.";    Personalized knickers -- a welcome
compliment, surely?;    "Not," Derry draws his hands a few inches apart, "when
they're only this big.";     EMF; plus Pop Will Eat Itself; Where: The
Warfield Theater, 982 Market St., San Francisco; When: Saturday (doors open 8
p.m., show at 9); How much: $18.50 general admission (415) 775-7722.; Etc:
Noon Monday at Stanford University's White Plaza. Free.  </TEXT>
