   A new attitude toward the Soviet Union has
already prompted retooling at America's national laboratories, the
three top-secret centers of nuclear weaponry and ``Star Wars''
research and development. As scientists search for new ways to use
their know-how, researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are
finding ways to help clean up the environment.

   The silver trough, as long as a
football field, was developed to harness the sun and help wean the
nation off imported oil. For years, it stood abandoned in the
desert, an obsolete relic of the 1970s.
   Now, in another time and another growing national crisis,
researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have dusted off their
sophisticated solar panels and put them back to work.
   This time, the panels are helping the environment. Sandia
scientists believe they've found an efficient way to use solar
power to break down toxic waste, help clean up polluted dumps and
cleanse contaminated water tables.
   ``We're just helping nature, that's all. There's nothing
artificial about this,'' said Virgil Dugan, Sandia's director of
Advanced Energy Technology.
   Solar research is just one area where scientists at Sandia, one
of the nation's three nuclear weapons laboratories, are finding
ways to help with growing environmental problems.
   As the need for ever improved nuclear weapons lessens, the
laboratories are directing their technological might to greater
peacetime use.
   With expertise developed for weapons programs and Army
machinery, ``smart'' robots are hurriedly being assembled to clean
out highly radioactive and toxic chemical waste at Department of
Energy weapons plants across the country.
   ``It's the same technology (that goes into weapons programs),
even though it seems there are two different applications,'' said
Pat Eicker, manager of Robotic Science and Technology at Sandia.
   In the case of the abandoned solar collector, scientists
realized they might be able to run contaminated water, such as
polluted ground water, through the sunlight-focusing machine and
use its power to help break down organic toxic waste.
   The contaminated water is mixed with a catalyst _ titanium
dioxide _ and pumped through a clear tube in the center of the
long, parabolic solar trough.
   The tube glows like Darth Vader's sword as sunlight activates
the titanium dioxide, which frees an electron. The electron grabs
onto organic material, in this case, the contaminates, and breaks
them down into water, carbon dioxide and a mild, harmless acid.
   Until a full-scale experiment last June, scientists weren't sure
if the solar machine would cause complete destruction of the
pollutants. It did.
   ``You can drink the water that comes out at the end,'' said Mike
Prairie, a senior technical staff member on the solar project.
   ``We never did this before because nobody thought of it
before,'' Dugan said. ``Some might say it's a breakthrough. I think
of it as an engineering advancement.''
   Companies are lining up to learn more about Sandia's gadget,
Dugan said. The laboratory plans to have a trial system out in a
year, and Dugan thinks the system is about four years away from
commercial use.
   Sandia has been testing the system with water contaminated by
trichloroethylene, a common degreasing substance that contaminates
ground water. Scientists believe the system will also work on PCBs,
dioxins, pesticides, dyes, solvents and other organic, or
carbon-based, materials.
   The solar panels won't help with the problem of nuclear waste,
however, because that is inorganic.
   Companies must now package their toxic waste and ship it to dump
sites or incinerators. The solar system might be economical enough
to allow even small firms to have on-site waste systems and also
may be portable, Dugan said. It will likely be more efficient, and
cheaper, than current ground water purification systems, he said.
   Sandia's robotics researchers began eight years ago to find ways
to use machines for the sometimes dangerous work of building
nuclear weapons and handling plutonium and other hazardous parts.
   Already the lab has created a ``smart'' manufacturing system
that will help automate some production in weapons plants. It has
also designed wheeled robotic vehicles for the Army.
   Now work is under way to create a system that can clean up toxic
areas too dangerous for humans to venture into at Department of
Energy weapons plants, such as Hanford, Wash.; Savannah River, Ga.;
Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Fernald, Ohio, and Pantex, Texas.
   Scientists say a robotic backhoe will be used at highly
radioactive and toxic pits, along with a 40-foot robotic arm with
sight and radar capabilities that can scan a dump, map pipes and
other obstacles, vacuum sand and dirt, lift and remove drums, and
clean leaking underground storage tanks.
   ``You've got to have some way to get in there and recover this
stuff,'' Eicker said. ``And it's so dangerous, people can't do it.''
   In one shed at Sandia, researchers hastily built a
one-tenth-scale model of a waste dump, along with a robotic arm,
because of a DOE rush to begin the cleanups.
   ``The use of models to simulate situations and the use of
sensors to facilitate work on nuclear weapons production is what
motivated this research,'' Eicker said.
   ``But this has far-reaching applications.''
