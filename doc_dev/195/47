<LEADPARA>  This generation of Americans never saw a parade like the one they held
Saturday in Washington -- a massive, classic, unabashed military parade of
helmeted warriors and rough war machines, led by banners and battle streamers
as bold as the crusaders' pennants or the flags of imperial Rome.;    But what
most distinguished Washington's National Victory Celebration wasn't its
time-honored pageantry or its blunt, triumphal, flag-waving message. It wasn't
its martial music, its 8,700 marching soldiers, its tanks, its missiles, or
even the presence of Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who led allied forces in
the Persian Gulf war and in this, their official parade.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THOUSANDS SALUTE GULF WAR TROOPS
CROWDS CHEER THE GEAR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It was what happened a thousand feet overhead a few minutes into the event,
when a single, angular, dead-black F-117A Stealth fighter slashed across the
sky in demonstration of what really distinguished the harsh, fast, one-sided
war against Iraq from all that had gone before it.;    Below, as the plane
passed, 200,000 necks craned and 200,000 voices turned from cheer to animal
roar.;    They might have come to honor the soldiers, but they truly loved the
gear.;    Cheers for troops, machines;    They cheered the M-1A1 tanks, the
trucked-in Patriot and Tomahawk cruise missiles and the towed fighter planes
almost as much as they did the first military unit sent to the gulf, the famed
82nd Airborne Division.;    Few among them seemed much bothered that these
same weapons had delivered massive death and destruction only a few months
before.;    "Wow!" said 7-year-old Lauren Broussard of Vienna, Va., when the
Stealth tore by. "It looks just like Darth Vader's ship.";    Stephanie
Diesel, 30, of Annandale, Va., the daughter of a retired naval officer, said
it with somewhat more sophistication: "We've had family involved in helping
develop some of the weaponry. It's nice to see it paid off.";    It was that
kind of crowd, one that included President Bush and a mass of government VIPs
and countless other federal employees as well -- a Washington-area crowd
tightly connected to the military and the bureaucracy, closer than most of the
country to weapons and the workaday of war.;    "Great day," exulted Bush, the
parade's reviewer-in-chief.;    The 200,000 people estimated by National Park
Police to have lined Constitution Avenue for the parade were far fewer than
predictions of 600,000 or more, and that's the sort of thing Washington
probably will argue about for a while: Does it mean disenchantment with the
war? Was the $12 million spent on the parade a bad idea? Was the parade itself
a bad idea?;    Amid the cheers and the promise of future debates, there were
tears.;    'Quiet remembrance';    "War also deserves quiet remembrance," Bush
said as he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National
Cemetery in the day's opening event.;    His voice caught as he said Kuwait is
free because "we dared risk our most precious asset, our sons and daughters,
our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives -- the finest troops any
country has ever had.";    Families of some of the 376 U.S. troops who lost
their lives in the Persian Gulf were at Arlington for the ceremony. Eyes
moistened and tears flowed during the singing of "Battle Hymn of the
Republic.";    But among the crowds lining the parade route, there was
near-unanimity that the parade was great, the troops were great, a huge
display of military hardware arrayed amid the Smithsonian museums on the
Washington Mall was great -- and the 82 aircraft that flew over were
tremendous.;    For them, the day was something like a county fair. One
exhibit tent on the Mall contained samples of every important bomb and
airborne missile used in the war; another offered the opportunity to put on a
gas mask; at every weapon exhibit, soldiers explained such questions as
explosive power and lethal range, demonstrated in one case with a howitzer
homed in on the top of the Washington Monument.;    But this was, finally, a
parade for the soldiers, and among those who marched, the day was
overwhelming.;    "I consider this the highlight of my career so far," said
Air Force Special Operations Lt. Rick Masters, an electronic warfare officer
on a giant AC-130 gunship based in Fort Walton Beach, Fla.;    "I lost some
good friends over there, and it all came together when we rounded the first
corner and the crowd started cheering," he said.;    The soldiers and most who
came to recognize them stood worlds away from those who criticized the parade
for its extravagance and its celebration of crushing power.;    However
quickly and efficiently the war was fought, the soldiers said again and again,
it was a war, and as Army Sgt. Donald Gibson of Winchester, Ky., declared with
conviction, "I sure didn't think it was so easy."  </TEXT>
