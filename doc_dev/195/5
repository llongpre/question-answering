   The largest display ever of the
magical creations of filmmaker George Lucas opens Thursday just a
few miles from the movie studio where his fantasies come alive.
   Visitors can see Han Solo, frozen into a block of carbon like a
coffin figure from ``The Empire Strikes Back,'' Luke Skywalker's
Landspeeder from ``Star Wars,'' the Ark of the Covenant from
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and a half-size Jabba the Hutt from
``Return of the Jedi.''
   The five-day show at Marin County's annual fair is free except
for fair admission.
   It has the look of an exhibit of pop culture as much as a
showing of Lucas' galaxy of special effects.
   Explanations are written on cards at each display, but most are
surely recognizable to even the least avid movie-goer. There is
Wicket on his Ewok hang glider, Darth Vader and his Imperial
Shuttle Craft, a stooped Yoda and the Star Wars storm troopers.
   ``We're putting out for the first time on this kind of scale the
very things which dreams and wishes are made of,'' said Judy Niles,
spokeswoman for Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, the
special-effects division of his movie-making empire.
   There also are mockups of Solo's clunker spaceship and Vader's
super-star destroyer; the Imperial At-At, or All Terrain Attack
Transport; the TaunTaun snow lizard; and the Imperial Scout
anti-grav Speeder Bike.
   In one corner of the 15,000-square-foot round auditorium, Vader
stands next to the Deathstar Battle Station.
   Nearby, where they will pose for pictures with guests, stand
C3PO and R2D2, Skywalker's mechanical sidekicks.
   ``This is a collection of giant flashes of imagination, all
inspired by Lucas,'' said Steve Gawley, model shop project
supervisor at Industrial Light and Magic in San Rafael, 15 miles
north of San Francisco.
   ``I think people will come here to try and see how their heroes
were created,'' said Gawley, who has worked for Lucas 13 years.
   Besides Lucas' creations, Industrial Light and Magic also has
created special effects for scores of other hit movies. The Klingon
Bird of Prey from ``Star Trek III'' is displayed, along with a
model of the DeLorean Time Machine from ``Back to the Future.''
   All the movie props were taken from a giant warehouse employees
call The Archive.
   Many were falling apart, and had to be repaired.
   ``These models die a little bit every time you move them,'' said
Niles. ``I doubt that we'll ever again be able to put on a show
this large. Certainly not one that's more than just a few miles
from our studio.''
   The same crew that handles lighting, makeup and costuming for
ILM arranged the display, which includes a star backdrop and videos
showing how the various items appeared on the big screen.
   Models of the spacecraft are startling in detail, not all of it
done in the utmost seriousness.
   Look in the cockpit of one, for example, and you'll see a
miniature Playboy poster, in another a NASA emblem. One has a sea
anchor on the outside of a space destroyer.
