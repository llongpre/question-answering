   Hours after a sniper opened fire on a
Greyhound bus in Florida last month, company chairman Fred Currey
was on the scene, boarding a bus to ride under the very overpass
where the gunman had hidden.
   Currey's visit was part of what a company spokesman termed a
``Florida blitz'' designed to gain Greyhound favorable statewide
news coverage in the early days of the strike by its drivers' union.
   ``Every news person in northern Florida was there,'' said
Greyhound spokesman George Gravley, whose company dispatched Currey
to three Florida cities that day to meet publicly with riders and
replacement drivers.
   Greyhound's public relations gambit was just one battle in the
war to court public favor in the six-week-old drivers' strike, but
analysts say it reflects a growing trend toward sophisticated
publicity contests in labor-management disputes.
   ``A public relation agent is a participant now either at the
bargaining table or right outside the room,'' said Don Blohowiak, a
New York media analyst who studies business-media relations.
   ``The court of public opinion is very important to success in
the marketplace. In something like a labor dispute, our impressions
stay with us for a very long time,'' Blohowiak said.
   He said most consumers ``want to do business with companies we
like or feel good about, companies we think conduct business with
their employees in a reasonable and ethical way.''
   Greyhound is not alone in seeking public favor in the strike.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, without an
in-house public relations department, hired a Washington company
six days before the strike to dramatize the economic issues, such
as the decline in drivers' average pay from $31,000 to $21,000
since 1983.
   Still, some labor leaders complain privately that the union
hasn't been as aggressive as Greyhound in seeking to mold public
opinion.
   ``The union hasn't awakened to the fact that it needs to sell
its message to win,'' said one labor analyst, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   But the union's public relations agent, Nick Nichols, said
striking drivers can't compete with the company's money.
   ``Clearly, it's a David and Goliath thing. The Greyhound drivers
simply don't have the resources,'' Nichols said.
   Neither side in the bus strike will say what it's spending for
public relations advice. Since March 2, when 6,300 drivers and
3,000 maintenance and other workers walked out, the strike has been
marred by vandalism and violence. The company has refused to return
to the bargaining table until a week goes by without a violent
incident.
   Analysts point to the ongoing Eastern Air Lines walkout and last
year's Pittston coal strike as recent labor disputes where unions
waged successful campaigns to win public support.
   Although machinists at Eastern are still on strike, their
publicity campaign against Frank Lorenzo, head of the carrier's
parent company, ``made him out to be the Darth Vader'' of the
corporate world in the public's mind, one labor official said.
   Blohowiak said companies are more media-conscious now than they
were 10 years ago because increased competition has prompted
consumers to consider a company's attitude toward its workers when
making purchasing decisions.
   ``After seeing the drubbing that Exxon took over one accident,
or a Frank Lorenzo took, you can't hide and pretend you don't have
problems, that no one's interested,'' he said.
   Greyhound's efforts to win public opinion have been persistent.
   Twice in two weeks, Dallas-based Greyhound executives flew to
Washington for news conferences to complain about strike-related
violence. Neither event had a Washington focus, and in fact, the
latest one was to announce the filing of a lawsuit in Florida
against union officials.
   Gravley, the Greyhound spokesman, said the event was held in
Washington because that's where the national press corps is based.
   ``If you want to be heard nationally, you have to go where the
national media is,'' said media analyst Don Kellermann.
   Greyhound used a well-known New York public relations firm,
Ruder Finn, for advice and help in setting up the Washington news
conferences. It also has taken out several full-page newspaper ads
on the strike.
   Labor officials contend the company's Washington announcements
are part of a strategy to distort public perception of the strike.
   ``It's a great tack for diverting attention from what the real
issues are,'' said Denise Mitchell, a Washington public relations
agent who helped Pittston miners win widespread community support
during last year's coal strike.
   Sophisticated publicity efforts by management have forced unions
to try to keep up, she said.
   ``We increasingly counsel people that they have to get out front
in the contest to win public support,'' Mitchell said. ``Being
prepared at the bargaining table, doing your homework on the
economic issues, just isn't enough anymore.''
