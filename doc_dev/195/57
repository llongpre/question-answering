<TEXT>  SOMEHOW, I've gotten stuck in the crowds long past the half-hour allotted for
each "character walk" at Great America. With each minute, it's getting more
difficult to balance the 20 pounds of Huckleberry Hound head on my shoulders
and pick up my size 25 Huckleberry Hound feet. The sweat is beginning to get
into my eyes, my neck aches, and my breathing, magnified inside the massive
fiberglass dog snout, sounds like Darth Vader on the last mile of the Bay to
Breakers. VWHOOSH-HAAAAA, VWHOOSH-HAAAAA. . .;    And still, the hound's eyes
remain lidded in sleepy affability. The hound's mouth grins amiably. And the
kids, screaming "Blue dog! Blue dog!" keep coming.;    My escort, noticing I'm
having trouble holding my head upright, is trying to maneuver Huck out of the
flow of traffic. I'm almost inside the guest relations building when I hear
him.;    "Hey, wait," he commands. Through the netted screen hidden in my
snout, I barely catch a glimpse of black T-shirt and burly bare arms. After
only a couple trips around the park, I know trouble when I see it. He's going
to be a back-pounder. His kids will probably go straight for my tail.;    I
continue my assault on the door, but without any peripheral vision, it's hard
to line up the hound head with the opening. Cornered, I grin happily at my
potential attacker.;    "How ya doin', Huck?" he brays. I brace myself, but it
turns out he's just another rabid Hound fan. Just another dude who wants to
shake my paw. I oblige, and return to trying to fit my head through the door.
I stumble through and hear someone ask, "Who's the dog?" as the door closes
behind me.;    "As characters, we must always be 'IN' character. In other
words, you are not Biff or Jody in a Scooby costume, you ARE Scooby."; --
Great America Character; and Escort Handbook 1991;    Lise Shannon, manager of
public relations at Great America, sounds uncertain when I pitch the idea of
being a cartoon character for a day at the Santa Clara theme park.;    Great,
she says, but what about "the Santa Factor?";    At Great America, as at other
theme parks, it is of vital importance that the public think Huckleberry Hound
is really Huckleberry Hound, not somebody in a Huckleberry Hound suit, she
explains.;    It's the Santa Factor that explains why the characters at Great
America never talk. They wouldn't have the right cartoon voice. And it's the
Santa Factor that explains why you'll never see two Fred Flintstones walking
together. There's only one Fred.;    Shannon says she'll talk to the people in
entertainment about the story and its potential for shattering young dreams
and call back.;    Hounded; When I reach Shannon a day later, she says Great
America has decided to go ahead with the story, with a few conditions. First
of all, nobody can be photographed in partial costume. No Scooby Doos with
their heads off. Second, while I can interview the kids who bring the costumes
to life, there will be no putting names to characters.;    And there's another
thing, Shannon says.;    "You're not claustrophobic, are you?" she asks. "I
mean, not at all claustrophobic?";    "Huck is a non-aggressive, enterprising
cocker spaniel.";    -- Great America Character; and Escort Handbook 1991;   
On a Friday afternoon, I head over to Show Wardrobe at Great America, the
place where the characters live when they're not out on "the street," as the
Great America staff calls the park's pathways.;    Great America, which opened
in 1976, started out with Warner Brothers cartoon characters. But when the
Marriott Corp. pulled out in 1985, it took Bugs Bunny with it. Kings
Entertainment Co., which took over when Marriott left, is under contract with
Hanna Barbera, the folks who dreamed up Yogi Bear, Quick Draw McGraw and
Scooby Doo, among others. Great America also has title to the Smurfs.;   
After some discussion, the Great America staff has decided I should be
Huckleberry Hound.;    "He's not real active," Shannon explains.;    Second
only to the character Code of Silence is the rule calling for characters to
act like the hounds, sharks, horses and prehistoric men they are.;    "Each
character has a bio, and it helps. It really does," says Lori Bowman, 20, who
is in charge of the characters. "You have to know everything about the
character. Who they hang out with and everything. People will ask you.";    Of
course, the character itself can't answer. But the escort who tails him or her
can. But the real reason the escort is along is to protect the character from
over-enthusiastic park guests.;    "They hit you," says Kathleen Sherman, area
manager of show operations for the park. "Especially the heads.";    "Never do
'statue walks' where you go out and stand perfectly still for all or part of
your walk. This is extremely boring and not entertaining at all."; -- Great
America Character; and Escort Handbook 1991;    At 10:30 Saturday morning, I'm
back in Show Wardrobe, decked out in the regulation red gym shorts, T-shirt
and knee-high athletic socks all characters wear underneath their fur. Around
me, a half dozen high school and college students bob and weave like the Road
Runner on speed. They are my comrades in characterhood.;    Sherman says being
a character is a very popular job at Great America. This year, about 95
overactive teen-agers and young adults tried out for about 15 jobs. Sherman
says during auditions she looks for the most outgoing, the most active, those
prone to the grand, sweeping gesture.;    "In everything we do," she says, "we
look for bigness.";    Kristian Collier, 18, is good at bigness. He bounces
continually as he explains why he wanted to work at Great America. He had a
job at a clothing store, but they told him he was too hyper.;    Not for the
last time, I appreciate the fact that Huckleberry Hound's bio pegs him as a
non-aggressive cocker spaniel, and ask the kids around me for pointers.;   
Dog grooming; "Drink lots of water," warns Shelly Loder, 18. She eyes me up
and down, obviously taking in the fact that I've got a good 10 years on
everybody else in the room.;    I start to gather up Huck's disparate parts:
the seat belt that goes around my waist and hooks to the hound head for
stability, the "pod" of padding and plastic tubing that gives Huck his
distinctive pear shape, the blue fur paws, the blue fur jumpsuit, the blue fur
feet.;    Finally, the hound head itself.;    "If a character goes down on the
street:;    A. Try to keep people away. Another employee should handle the
crowd. B. Send all other characters backstage. C. CHECK TO SEE IF THE
CHARACTER IS CONSCIOUS OR NOT!"; -- Great America Character; and Escort
Handbook 1991;    Rosemary Stanford usually works in sales for Great America.
However, today she's been assigned as my escort.;    Lori Bowman arrives just
as Stanford and I are trying to secure my head. Expertly, she slides her hand
in and fastens my chin strap. We practice a few hand signals: paw thumb up
means I'm OK, paws at right angles to form a time-out signal means get me out
of here now.;    With Bowman holding one paw and Stanford holding the other, I
shuffle toward the gray gates that screen the back lot of Great America from
the paying guests.;    Roll your hands into two loose fists and place them
over your eyes. That's how well I can see.;    Walking the dog; I've barely
managed to get my head through the gate when a covey of teen-age girls runs up
to me. They giggle wildly as I attempt to locate their hands, which I intend
to shake once I find them. Bowman lines them up and offers to take a picture.
"Smile," she commands, and I grin crazily inside the head.;    The next 20
minutes are a blur of blundering into strollers, bopping unsuspecting babies
with my snout and fending off pre-teen boys intent on finding a zipper
somewhere. The kids were right: People do like to hit you. It's not so much
that they want to hurt you; they just want to figure out how real you are.
After all, in cartoons, you can hit Huck with a frying pan and in the next
scene he's singing "My Darling Clementine.";    Periodically, Bowman asks,
"Everything OK, Huck?" I give her the thumbs up and proceed to pose with a
gang of boys. I put my arms around them and the one on my right gives me a
karate chop. I bring my paw down a little harder than necessary on his
shoulder. I can't help it. It's a reflex.;    "Let's go in, Huck," Bowman
says.;    "If you are in pain, tell your supervisor or lead. It is possible
that there is something wrong with the interior of your costume."; -- Great
America Character and Escort Handbook 1991;    On a typical day, a character
at Great America takes six half-hour-long walks: three before lunch, three
after. A character is on the street for a half-hour and then gets a half-hour
rest before heading out again. On especially hot days, the walks last 20
minutes. Starting pay is $5.25 an hour.;    I lumber into Show Wardrobe about
10 minutes ahead of schedule. The temperature's in the 60s outside, and still,
when Stanford gets my head off, my hair is soaked with sweat.;    I take an
especially long break, but soon it's time for another character walk. This
time, Stanford and I are heading to the Orleans section of the park. Both
Bowman and Stanford doubt I have the skills necessary to walk there in
costume, so, like some kind of cartoon-world Mafia, we stuff Huck in a bag and
dump him in the trunk of Stanford's car.;    On the drive over, I keep
expecting to hear pounding coming from the back.;    "Great America exists
because people need to get away, to have fun, to experience a different
environment, to forget about traffic, smog, the cost of living, world turmoil,
earthquakes, crime, problems, LIFE.";    -- Great America Character and Escort
Handbook, 1991.;    On my second character walk, I'm getting the hang of
things, and so is Stanford. Realizing Huck's vision is not all that it could
be, she gives me clues: "Oh look, Huck! A real little one to your right!";   
First, I bend my head down. Second, I spot the toddler wobbling toward me.
Third, I bend my knees and give the tyke a hug.;    Suddenly, it's like a Leo
Buscaglia lovefest. Women reach out and touch my shoulder. Men give me the old
hey-buddy whack on the back. Young girls line up to shake my hand.;    Puppy
love; There's only one problem: boys 11 to 15 years old. They pull my tail.
They kick. And they will just not let up on the zipper question.;    "The
worst part is when they feel you up," says Jennifer Koontz. "They want to know
if you're a boy or a girl.";    Still, it's worth it. Aside from the
occasional obnoxious boy headed for a lifetime of cutting people off in
traffic, everyone is happy to see ol' Huck. Toddlers especially cannot get
enough of the blue dog. It's hard to resist such unconditional love.;    Yeah,
adds Pete Adams. But just don't forget who you are once you leave the park.
The character business can make you unnaturally gregarious.;    "I get
outside, and I'm still acting like I'm in costume," he says. "I'm smiling and
waving at people, and they're looking at me like I'm crazy."  </TEXT>
