FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): A shield to fend off the knives

In the real world it would be classed as a sound Budget with exciting
political potential. It does nobody any harm, and it might do some important
groups of voters, including pensioners and the long-term unemployed, a
modicum of good.
It contains no controversial new decisions, yet it shows courage by
confirming an important old one - to increase VAT on domestic fuel by the
full 17.5 per cent. Best of all, it puts the chancellor in a position to
announce cuts in personal taxation next November, or the one after that, or
indeed in both years; anyhow in time for the next election. Preparations for
the mother of all bribes are well in hand.
Unfortunately for the government its supporters have long since floated off
the world as we know it. We saw them, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, in battle on
Monday afternoon. They were squabbling about an extra Pounds 75m
contribution to the European Union's budget. Their unearthly shrieking
shattered the party.
The chancellor snarled over his shoulder at his opponents, all at that time
recognised by the whips as Conservatives. He stood like Darth Vader,
battling for the galaxy. Improbable life-forms zoomed around his head. About
seven or eight of them were banished by the Tory whips. The question was not
whether the Conservatives would win again in 1996 or 1997, but whether they
could remain in office that long.
Yesterday we saw a quite different chancellor. Back in humanoid form Mr
Clarke droned for Britain, solid, dependable, wise, Captain Kirk. He had
nothing to say, but he said it very well. His perception, that the
government is in a deep hole, is matched by his strategy, which is that the
only route to salvation is a period of good, solid, uneventful
administration. So he began his speech by describing the Conservative
Wirtschaftswunder.
Familiar it may be, but it still sounds miraculous. The economy is growing
at 4 per cent a year, fastest in Europe. Registered unemployment is falling;
the number of people in jobs is rising. Exports are up; balance of payments
trends are positive; inflation is lower than it has been within the living
memory of two-thirds of the population. Stick with the government for just a
few more years and the budget will be back in balance, the huge borrowing
requirement wiped out.
In the real world any chancellor describing such a golden set of numbers
would simper as he did it. The benches behind him would cheer, wave their
order papers, or at least rumble 'hear hear'. Even yesterday afternoon, the
House of Commons could not be described as the real world.
Mr Clarke exchanged defensive and unscripted banter with the benches
opposite, while behind him his colleagues sat stony faced. As time went by,
some of them fell into the arms of Morpheus. They should have sat up and
paid attention. The other side did. Both the Labour and Liberal benches were
bemused, as they saw one stratagem of theirs after another emerge from the
chancellor's box, now to be used as a shield to protect the government and
the prime minister from the knives aimed at their backs. It is an intricate
device. Some of its components have been borrowed from the opposition.
What Mr Clarke called a 'set of effective policies to tackle the big problem
of structural unemployment which faces the whole western world' sounded not
unlike the welfare-to-work proposals borrowed by Labour's advisers from
President Bill Clinton's coterie. The details may not match, but the broad
methodology is similar: adjust social security where it acts as a
disincentive to take a job and subsidise employment where that might help.
Another notion - for a landfill tax - elicited smiles of recognition from
the Liberals. The patent for Mr Clarke's schemes to attract private-sector
capital in support of public ventures was claimed, vociferously, by Mr John
Prescott. Yesterday's closure of 'tax loopholes' was recognisably lifted
from Labour. None of this is quite fair: the government, through the
chancellor, has put in a lot of work in these areas. Some of Mr Peter
Lilley's ideas on social payments contain elements of originality. But the
same can be said of some Labour and Liberal proposals.
Even so, Mr Clarke is a star, and not only by the dismal standards of those
around him. His speech yesterday was dull and long, yet, as during Monday
afternoon's scrap, his delivery showed that he is afraid of no one, that his
self-confidence knows no bounds. The contrast with the demeanour of the
prime minister, who sat slumped beside him, was painful to behold.
The chancellor's career has not been without blemish. Some say he left a
trail of destruction or unfinished business at the departments he ran, not
least at health and the Home Office. It may be that he reached the Treasury
at just the right time, that he is supremely fortunate.
Those of us who would not hesitate to castigate him had he suffered bad luck
must give him credit for his handling of the blessings of fate. He has stuck
to the prime minister's counter-inflation policy, reinforcing it by allying
himself with the Bank of England. He has resisted calls to reduce taxes as
if there was to be an election tomorrow, knowing well enough that this is a
mid-term, not end-of-term, financial statement. At a time when the
government seems to wake up every morning not knowing whether it will live
out the day, he has persisted in playing it long.
We may therefore look with understanding upon his sprinkling of coins in the
direction of this or that clutch of voters. His programmes to promote
employment seem to come from the heart; in a hard-nosed world he remains a
one-nation Tory. Savers who harbour Tessas and Peps in their portfolios may
thank him for the extension of these tax-free opportunities. Cutting overall
expenditure while allowing real-terms increases for health, education and
the police is political common sense, an answer to some of the points made
by the Conservative party's Mr John Maples in his celebrated, leaked
memorandum.
To recall Mr Maples and his document is to fall back into the irrational
universe, the one that now surrounds the administration. Last week was one
the Conservatives will want to forget; there is no need to rehearse all its
events now. Monday's parliamentary mess was a spillover. We need not
describe each humiliation. The government is visibly falling to pieces,
partly over its divided attitude to the EU, and partly as a result of its
small majority. The prime minister cannot be confident that there will be no
challenge to his leadership.
If this was a normal government, operating in the mode usually adopted in
mid-term, we could be certain that Mr Clarke's Budget was a likely winner.
In these surreal times, that may be too much to ask.
