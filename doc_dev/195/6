<LEADPARA>  "STAR Wars" is coming back.;    George Lucas, creator of the science-fiction
series and director of the original 1977 movie, plans to develop and produce a
second trilogy of films from "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,"
said Lucasfilm Ltd. spokeswoman Lynne Hale, speaking by telephone from company
headquarters in San Rafael.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "George Lucas said he will do the next trilogy of 'Star Wars,' " Hale
said.;    Hale did not specify when the first film would be made, but expected
the three to be completed over the next five to seven years. Analysts project
that a new "Star Wars" movie could be released to theaters by 1997.;    It is
believed to be the first time Lucasfilm has confirmed there would be a new
series of "Star Wars" adventures, although Lucas has hinted as much for some
time.;    Lucas declined an interview request last week.;    While Hale said
"everything at this stage is speculative," the next "Star Wars" trilogy is
believed to be a "prequel" to the original, which would follow the early
adventures of Ben "Obi-Wan" Kenobi, Darth Vader and the child Luke Skywalker.;
   "George Lucas has an idea of what he wants to do but we are not even
pre-production at this stage," Hale said.;    Any news of a "Star Wars" movie
sparks excitement in Hollywood because it represents "the purest opportunity
for a true Hollywood blockbuster," said Paul Bricault, an analyst with Paul
Kagan Associates Inc., a Carmel research firm.;    After all, 1977's "Star
Wars" ($267.4 million), 1980's "The Empire Strikes Back" ($222.6 million) and
1983's "Return of the Jedi" ($252.4 million) form the highest grossing series
of movies in Hollywood history. In total, the movies earned about $1.4 billion
in today's dollars, Bricault said.;    "Star Wars opened up the modern era of
major summer blockbuster pictures," said Bill Immerman, who negotiated the
original Star Wars studio deal for production chief Alan Ladd Jr. "They opened
people's eyes to what kind of business a modern movie could do.";    Hale said
"Star Wars" will wait until after Lucasfilm completes "other projects already
scheduled." Those include television's "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles,"
which went into production May 13. The one-hour series is scheduled to
premiere on ABC in 1992.;    Lucasfilm also has "Red Tails," a movie based on
a World War II unit of black fighter pilots, lined up ahead of the Star Wars
project.;    At the completion of the last "Star Wars" sequel in 1983, Lucas
said the pressure to finish the first three movies was intense because the
actors were aging, the sets were gathering dust and he was paying rent on
facilities.;    At the time, Lucas said he would take a long break from "Star
Wars," if he did not abandon future productions of the science-fiction epic
altogether.;    Hollywood's rumor mill has been in overdrive about "Star Wars"
since Bantam Books released "Star Wars: Heir to the Empire" on May 15. The
book's release prompted speculation that "Heir to the Empire" would serve as a
blueprint for Lucasfilm's next Star Wars blockbuster.;    Written by
science-fiction author Timothy Zahn, "Heir to the Empire" takes place five
years after "Return of the Jedi," taking up after the destruction of the Death
Star and the requited love of Han Solo and Princess Leia.;    "Heir to the
Empire" finds Han and Leia married, governing the fledgling republic and
dealing with threats to peace. Luke Skywalker, meanwhile, is the first in a
new line of Jedi knights.;    Hale was emphatic that "there are no plans at
all to make a movie out of the book.";    She said "Heir to the Empire" is
based only on the "Star Wars" characters, not on the nine stories originally
created by George Lucas -- the basis of all "Star Wars" movies.;    Movie
audiences have seen the fourth, fifth and sixth installments of Lucas' nine
stories, Hale said.;    Zahn's book is an example of the properties and
products "Star Wars" has spawned. Last week, Lucasfilm's game division
announced it will introduce a "Star Wars" video game for Nintendo
Entertainment this year.  </TEXT>
