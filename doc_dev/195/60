SUCCESS, they say, breeds success. If you believe such aphorisms then look
no further than the 22-year-old American, Jim Courier, as the winner of the
1993 French Open which begins at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris on Monday.
For the past two years he has outhit, outwitted and outlasted all opposition
on the slow red clay. Courier in full flight - a whirling mass of flailing
arms and pumping legs - may not be a pretty sight but his physical game is
undeniably effective. Courier, a stocky right-hander with a two-handed
backhand, dashes about the court smiting the ball as if he hates it. His
western grip forehand, a heavy topspin blow which delivers most of his
winners, resembles the slugging action of a baseball batter. Not surprising,
this, because Jim seriously considered a career in professional baseball
with the Cincinnati Reds before settling on tennis. The baseball cap and the
striped shirts he wears echo his lasting love affair with America's national
sport.
Courier is trained by Jose Higueras and Brad Stine to peak at the Grand Slam
events. 'They are the only wins anyone ever remembers,' he says. He looked
fit and hard again when I watched him overpower Goran Ivanisevic to win in
Rome last Sunday, his fourth tournament win of the year. He thrives on
physical challenges, as he proved on a sweltering afternoon last January in
Melbourne by outplaying Stefan Edberg to win a second consecutive Australian
title.
Is there anyone with the physical and mental qualities, as well as the
technical ability, to unseat him? In last year's final Courier overwhelmed
Petr Korda. The Czech form does not suggest he will be a serious challenger
this time.
One who may have the necessary qualities is the 18-year-old Ukrainian,
Andrei Medvedev. He won the junior champion at Roland Garros in 1991 and
defeated the experienced Swiss Davis Cup player Jakob Hlasek in last year's
French Open en route to the fourth round, where Courier ended his run.
Medvedev won his first tour titles last year in Geneva and Stuttgart and
this year has won in Estoril and Barcelona, both clay court tournaments. He
is a tall and intelligent young man, with a lively sense of humour, mature
beyond his years. His fluent baseline game - few men hit the ball harder or
time it better - gives him a solid base from which to mount his net attacks
and his tactical awareness is already well developed. He is just the sort of
player who might make a sudden surge - as Michael Chang did at 17 in 1989.
Could Chang do it again? Certainly he has the courage and determination to
succeed, plus a wonderful return of serve, and few men can equal his speed
about the court. But the modern game is dominated by young gorillas wielding
their graphite rackets like Darth Vader's light sword.
One such giant is the 6 ft 5 in German, Marc Goellner. His feat in beating
Edberg and Lendl to capture the Nice title as a qualifier last month was
remarkable. It would be even more astonishing, though, if he were to do
anything of note in Paris. Life is not that simple.
Of the others Ivan Lendl, with three previous wins from five finals is the
most experienced. Furthermore he has just won on clay in Munich and is as
fit as a flea but at the age of 33 he may no longer have the mental stamina
to win seven hard matches in a row.
The new world No 1, Pete Sampras did not look impressive in losing to
Ivanisevic in Rome but claimed he was only preparing for Paris. At his best
Sampras has the powerful game to beat anyone but I fancy his chances more on
Wimbledon's fast grass than on slow European clay where his lack of patience
is exposed.
What of Becker? A former semi-finalist, Boris has still to win a tournament
on clay. Like Sampras, expect more from him at Wimbledon.
Overshadowing the women's event is the absence of the champion Monica Seles.
Gunther Parche's attack on the world No 1 in Hamburg will have repercussions
throughout the sporting world. Security at tennis tournaments will be
increased with players escorted to courts where they have to pass among the
paying public.
More worrying is the copycat factor. In Rome last week police arrested
Hubert Uebele, a bearded middle-aged man from Heidelberg. They took him back
to his hotel room and discovered a pistol, knives, pictures of Gabriela
Sabatini and Becker and tickets for front row seats for the Foro Italico.
The women will all try to block out thoughts of danger as they battle for
the absent queen's crown. The obvious favourite is Steffi Graf who has won
two of her five French Opens finals. A recent win in Berlin will encourage
her supporters but I am not convinced that Steffi has recovered the
consistency which she will need on slow clay. Too often of late there have
been lapses of concentration.
Sabatini looked fit and eager when I saw her in Marbella on Wednesday
training with her new coach Dennis Ralston. She is determined to make a
strong bid for the No 1 spot.
However, I believe the title might go to Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the
youngest winner when she beat Graf in a memorable final in 1989. The
ebullient Spaniard is having the most consistent year of her career with
four titles already and has taken on Sabatini's coach Carlos Kirmayr. He has
helped Arantxa to relax in her matches - tension has always been her
weakness - but what would you expect from a man who once ran a band called
The Fleabags]
