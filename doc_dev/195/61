   More than 20 years after Martin Luther King Jr.
delivered his last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church, one of his
daughters stepped up to the same pulpit to deliver her first as a
minister.
   In an emotional service Monday that drew more than 300 people,
Bernice Albertine King, 27, became the second woman ordained at the
historic church.
   Ms. King, the youngest of King's four children and the only one
to go into the ministry, also graduated Monday from Emory
University with doctoral degrees in law and divinity.
   ``This is the most humbling moment for me in my life,'' Ms. King
said. ``I am not worthy of this high calling. No blood, no sweat,
no tears could earn me this high calling.''

   Kathleen Turner declared herself a fervent
feminist and risk taker in a commencement speech at Emerson College.
   ``My kind of feminism says, `I can make my own choices.' And as
students commencing you are all individuals,'' the actress told
more than 650 graduates Monday.
   ``You must make your own choices,'' said Turner. She said her
success came from hard work and care in the screen and stage roles
she has accepted.
   Just as important, she said, ``past, present and future _ I take
chances.''

   Actor James Earl Jones didn't exactly come
back empty-handed from a fishing trip over the weekend.
   ``I didn't catch anything except a heart full of love for this
country,'' Jones said during his weekend stay in Juneau to narrate
a film about the killer whale Shamu for the Sea World marine parks.
   The name Shamu is given to several whales used at parks in
California, Florida, Texas and Ohio.
   ``This is a new idea at Sea World,'' said Jones, the voice of
Darth Vadar in ``Star Wars.'' ``Instead of just voice narration for
the shows, they use a large screen to show natural habitats and
other background of the animals.''

   Ved Mehta, an author and staff writer
for The New Yorker since 1961, has been named a writer in residence
at Yale University.
   The author will be a fellow for three years at Berkeley College,
one of Yale's 12 colleges for undergraduates, the university
announced Monday. He will teach a course on creative writing in the
fall and on non-fiction next spring.
   The Indian-born author is the first Rosenkranz writer in
residence, named for the new $1 million endowment created by 1962
Yale graduate Robert Rosenkranz and his wife, Margaret.
   Mehta, a naturalized American who holds degrees from Harvard and
Oxford, has written books on history, theology and linguistics. His
most recent book, ``The Stolen Light,'' published in 1989, is his
sixth in an autobiographical series.

   Martina Navratilova returned to
her native land to see the changes firsthand since the country shed
Communist rule last year, but she doesn't plan to stay.
   ``I still can't believe all the things I heard about the
revolution are true,'' the tennis star said. ``I just had to come
here and see it for myself.''
   Navratilova defected in 1975 and later became a naturalized
American. Last year, in 10 dramatic, peaceful days the country's
former rulers were ousted.
   On Monday the 34-year-old athlete returned to her native town of
Revnice, some 20 miles west of Prague, for her second visit home.
Her first visit was in 1986, when the U.S. team defeated
Czechoslovakia in the Federation Cup.
   ``When I was leaving Prague then, I felt sorry for everyone who
had to stay, because they simply did not have the right to
travel,'' she said. ``I was depressed.
   ``Now it's another story. Everybody has the same rights and I
don't have to be depressed.''

   Barbara Bush said someone in the University
of Pennsylvania's class of 1990 ``may be a future president of the
United States _ and I wish her well.''
   The first lady's mention of a future woman president brought the
loudest applause and cheers Monday at the university's 234th
commencement.
   ``As important as your obligations as a graduate student, or
future doctor, or lawyer, or business leader, you are a human being
first, a husband or a wife first, a father or a mother first, a son
or a daughter first, a friend first,'' she said in her address.
``How sorry it would be to fail at one of these positions.''
   Mrs. Bush is at the center of a controversy over an invitation
to speak at Wellesley College's commencement. Some students at the
women's school in Massachusetts complained that she is known more
for her husband's accomplishments than for her own.
