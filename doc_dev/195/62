   A young brother and sister traveling in the
back of a rented moving truck were found dead from carbon monoxide
poisoning, and two of their siblings were hospitalized, one
critically.
   Kimberley K. Hughes, 8, and Christopher A. Hughes, 5, of Vader,
Wash., were pronounced dead Sunday at Ivinson Memorial Hospital in
Laramie, shortly after they were discovered unconscious in the
truck, officials said.
   Terry A. Hughes, 6, was in critical condition today and her
brother, Leon H. Hughes, 7, was in serious condition at Children's
Hospital in Denver, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Coroner Doug Bussell in Albany County, Wyo., said the children's
mother, Tina Hughes, was riding in the cab with her companion, Mark
McMillan. The family was moving to eastern Kansas.
   Hughes and McMillan went to check on the children early Sunday
while stopping at a gas station and couldn't wake them, Bussell
said. Autopsies showed Kimberley and Christopher died of carbon
monoxide poisoning, he said.
   The coroner said there wouldn't be an inquest into the deaths
and no charges were anticipated being filed against the adults.
