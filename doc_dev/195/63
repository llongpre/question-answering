<LEADPARA>  WHILE former Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown -- who we had thought was running for
U.S. Senate but who now says he's "not unthinking" about running for president
-- is spending his summer nuking bridges to the Democratic Party
establishment, two other candidates for Alan Cranston's Senate seat -- Rep.
Mel Levine, D-Santa Monica and Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford -- have been
amassing the kind of campaign bank accounts needed to present ideas to 13
million voters.;    The new Jerry Brown -- who says he'll decide just what
he's running for in about a month -- sounds a lot like the old Bobby Kennedy,
George McGovern, Gary Hart and Joe Biden. Which isn't too surprising since he
has been developing his anti-establishment, neo-populist message with the aid
of Pat Caddell, the Darth Vader of the Democratic Party, whose ideological
lineage follows just this path.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In a series of mid-July KABC radio commentaries on the "Crisis of Decline,"
the influence of Caddell (originator of Jimmy Carter's "Crisis of Confidence")
is unmistakable as Brown rails against "Washington's entrenched political
leadership -- Democrat and Republican alike" who have "forged an unholy
alliance," with the "forces of greed and special privilege" to "fuel monstrous
political campaigns designed to crush any challenge.";    Especially his.;   
"In a literal sense, of course, there was no secret meeting of conspirators to
ratify this dark arrangement," said Brown. "The evolution was gradual and many
elected officials were themselves victims, subtly sucked into a powerful
vortex of corruption. Nonetheless, the conduct and consequences of this system
is in reality not much different from one that might have been shaped in a
Capitol Hill back room in the dead of night.";    Despite his vintage
Caddellian rhetoric, Brown offered no concrete proposals. "The first
referendum is over what is reality," said Caddell in defense of Brown. "He's
developing his thinking. I've never seen a politician go through an
intellectual exercise like this . . . He's in the process of burning some very
serious bridges.";    This closed system of reasoning also led George
Capanelli, Brown's campaign coordinator, to explain why they opted last week
to take advantage of a loophole that permits an exploratory committee not to
file a fund-raising report.;    "We don't care to take part in this political
ball score that has helped fuel this incredible obsession with money," he
said. Only a cynic would suggest Brown's complaint stems from an inability to
convince leading Democrats and campaign contributors that he can win
Cranston's seat.;    Levine, on the other hand, demonstrated why he is seen as
the candidate to beat in the Democratic primary despite the fact that fewer
than one in five Democrats even know who he is.;    Raising $1.7 million and
transferring $1.7 million from his Congressional campaign fund, Levine is
sitting on $3 million -- double the amount of his nearest competitor,
Campbell.;    Levine's problem is that most of that money comes from his base
among the Jewish community of Los Angeles where he enjoys huge support from
the Berman-Waxman Machine -- so named for Reps. Howard Berman and Henry
Waxman.;    When former Rep. Ed Zschau began his Senate quest in the fall of
1985, he was an asterisk in the polls. He became known large through $3
million of advertising, much of it featuring his famous electric-blue sonic
"Zzzzzzzschau" spot.;    How Levine will accomplish the same remains unclear
-- especially when Rep. Barbara Boxer -- who has $671,000 in the bank -- and
Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy -- with $585,000 on hand -- will be competing for
attention.;    Meanwhile, Republican commentator Bruce Herschensohn of Los
Angeles posted an anemic financial report, having raised just $189,000 and
with a meager $152,000 in the bank.;    Campbell, the Silicon Valley
congressman, boasted about his "13-1 lead over Herschensohn" as he reported
raising $1.1 million on top of the $612,000 he had from Congress for a war
chest of $1.5 million.;    As he heads toward the fall, Campbell's problem
isn't his fund-raising ability, but whether, as a pro-choice, pro-environment
Republican, he can win the support of the conservative wing of the party.;   
Sharp doubts on that front began to surface last week when word leaked out of
Washington that John Gavin, a former actor and outspoken ambassador to Mexico,
is being urged to enter the race as a conservative with a chance of winning.; 
  "The basic feeling in the White House and among senior Republican
strategists is that we need a conservative to run to solidify the president's
base, to counterbalance Sen. (John) Seymour and to help (Gov.) Pete Wilson,
who obviously has problems with the conservative side of the party," said one
GOP strategist.;    The thinking among certain GOP forces is that Herschensohn
-- who would dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency and the United
Nations -- may be too strident to win the GOP nomination but that the
conservatives of Orange County and elsewhere will sit on their hands if the
GOP nominees are moderates Seymour and Campbell.;    The fear is that Bush's
ability to carry California in the 1992 presidential election -- and Wilson's
statewide GOP support -- could be undermined by so moderate a GOP senatorial
ticket. Some of those said to be worried include businessmen who have already
lent their names to Campbell's campaign.;    According to GOP sources, senior
officials in the White House had been pushing Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Jack Kemp -- former quarterback for the San Diego Chargers -- to get
into the race. And when he declined, there was some sentiment in favor of Rep.
David Dreier of La Verne, who dates Bush's divorced daughter, Dorothy
LeBlond.;    Dreier confirmed to Los Angeles politics watcher Joe Scott that
media guru Roger Ailes and GOP wiseman Charlie Black had urged him to run but
that he wants to stay in the House.;    "There's a lot of sentiment for a
strong conservative to run," said a GOP sage. "Campbell's just not perceived
as a conservative."  </TEXT>
