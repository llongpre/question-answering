<HEAD>Women Thwart Rape Attempt at Clothing Store; `They Really Let Him

   Two clothing store employees foiled a
would-be rapist by biting him, grabbing his gun away and beating
him on the head with a pipe, authorities said.
   Michael Ralph Vader, 35, of Fallon was booked for investigation
of kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault, and he required
medical treatment, polic said. He was arrested about four hours
after the Saturday evening incident.
   ``They really let him have it,'' said Assistant Police Chief
Louis Fetherolf. ``The woman who bit his hand really took a chunk
out. And the woman who hit him with the pipe nailed him in the head
a number of times. There was a lot of blood.''
   Fetherolf said a man entered the Lady Faire store Saturday
evening and ordered the two female employees into the back at
gunpoint.
   He ordered one of the women to stay in a back room and the other
to disrobe. But as the man began to take his clothes off, the
disrobed woman decided to resist.
   Fetherolf said she severely bit his hand and grabbed the
small-caliber pistol. The gun fired in a subsequent scuffle, but no
one was hit. The woman then gained control of the gun and tried to
shoot the suspect, but it wouldn't go off.
   The other woman came to her aid and ``split the suspect's head
open'' by repeatedly beating him in the head with a heavy pipe,
Fetherolf said.
   The man put his clothes back on and rushed out the store,
leaving a trail of blood. Vader was arrested without incident at a
trailer park south of Fallon later in the evening.
