<DESCRIPT>  SOUTH-KOREA; ANALYSIS  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The campus of Yonsei University was an oasis of leafy green, deceptively calm
before the student demonstration scheduled that September afternoon. Not
knowing what to expect, I had left behind everything that might get in the way
if the demonstration turned violent. A reporter friend lent me a helmet and
gas mask. I was prepared, or so I thought.;   As we swung around a bend in the
road, the first thing visible was not mobs running from teargas but drummers.
Students, maybe 20 in a circle, were dancing, singing, rocking back and forth
to the ratta-tat-tat of bamboo switches on taut drumheads.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This was a demonstration? No one told me South Korea would be like this, an
opera in mid-act.;   The violence came later, and one man died. But most of
the rest of the four-hour spectacle, like almost everything else in Korea, was
nothing like news stories about the place would lead you to expect.;   All
spring, story after story described students demonstrating, crazies or true
believers setting themselves on fire, families grieving over the casualties.; 
 The images in books on Korean history and culture suggested the mayhem came
naturally. The books said Koreans are emotional, exciteable, always getting
into fights.;   What they didn't say was that letting it all hang out makes
for human relations of pointless violence, for political stalemate and for the
courage and hopelessness of people who go down fighting for a cause, no matter
how undefendable.;   It doesn't take years of travel in Asia to know that the
places many Americans link through history, proximity and common cultural
threads are more different than similar. Learning about one does not
necessarily provide clues to learning another.;   What the media considers
news does not always help. Hints to understanding can get lost in the barrage
of information about today's events, color and emotion squeezed out by the
urgencies of fact.;   Visually, the up-to-date veneer on the area around Seoul
gives the impression that South Korea might operate with the bland
bureaucratic efficiency expected of a "modern" country. Bland is not the word
for it.;   The deceptive look comes from South Korea's reaching the status of
a "middle" level economy. The nation is not as rich as Japan but is more
industrialized and better off than most of its Asian neighbors. Anonymous new
highways and high-rises stand as a legacy of the nation's determiniation to
come of age with the 1988 Olympics.;   Some of the polish also comes from
having to please customers from Japan, the respected but hated rival and
onetime master. The Japanese came of age with the 1964 Olympics, and went on
to wow the world with their industriousness. That's what Korea would have you
believe it would like to do.;   Poke beneath the surface in Korea, though, and
the picture fractures.;   Koreans admit that hopes to catch up with Japan, or
even best the old nemesis, remain distant. Their social infrastructure makes
one wonder if it is unattainable. It's shot through in the texture a visitor
sees. In Japan, the grease of human relations is formal courtesy. In South
Korea, it is conflict.;   Walking into a regular Seoul store, not one on the
usual tourist path, can be like walking into combat. The sales clerk will a)
ignore you, b) snarl, or c) ask blankly what you wanted.;   Restaurants are
another battleground. The same rules apply.;   Asked for another glass of tea
in a small country-style eatery tucked into a corner of the antiques and art
district, one grumpy waitress shot back, "Why are you drinking all my tea? If
you keep asking for more, you'll use up my entire supply." You could live a
lifetime in Japan and never once hear such a retort.;   Want a fight? Call a
taxi. If the driver won't use the meter, get out immediately with a curse. The
typical driver will reluctantly let you back in, flip on the meter, then drive
like a maniac over a longer than necessary course to get back at the perceived
slight. That's what you get for refusing to be conned.;   Korea veterans
snickered when they heard my stories of such exchanges. "Typical," said one
American reporter with four years' residence under her belt. "Everyone is
trying to take advantage.";   A Korean man put it this way: In Korea, there
can only be one king. Everyone is fighting to be that one king. And because of
a Confucian belief that the man who backs down and compromises shows his
weakness, there can be no political compromise here.;   Therefore, went the
reasoning of other conversations with Koreans and Japanese, the two Koreas
will never just calmly join hands and reunite. Each wants to take over the
other. Their inability to compromise makes the entire peninsula a tinderbox.
Unification will come only with time, perhaps the death of Kim Il Sung, the
North Korean "king," or when faced by a nuclear threat from rival Japan.;  
Which brings me back to the campus, where the opera was into its second act.; 
 The demonstration started like a party, but then followed the scripts my
Korean friend had described: a fight to the death over who would be king, with
each side standing its pre-claimed ground.;   Banners and student chants
spelled out old issues: Americans get out. Koreans should share one seat in
the United Nations.;   The irony was deep. The U.N. General Assembly was
expected the next day to accept the separate memberships of both nations, an
event precipitated by North Korea's decision a few weeks previously to drop
years of opposition to separate memberships.;   The phalanx of police in Darth
Vader riot gear followed their standoff script, too. They barely flinched as
students advanced to the gate and tossed flaming Molotov cocktails at them
through the fast-falling dusk.;   And then it was over. Traffic started again.
A water cannon spat tear-gas-laced water on the last students. The students
burned an American flag. We left.;   Later that night, one man died. He was
hit by a police bullet after diehard protesters attacked a police station,
setting it afire. The students grabbed his body, later turned it over to the
family. More street theater. Then a retreat to fight again.  </TEXT>
