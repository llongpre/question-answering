   A dream-traveler ready for intergalactic
adventure climbs into a cockpit and steadies his hands on the
controls. The experience begins.
   Immense robotic creatures lug their massive frames over a rocky
terrain, waging war against the enemy. Every flip of a lever, every
tilt of the control stick fires shrieking deadly lasers,
decapitating other lumbering land giants and splashing metal body
parts over the empty planet.
   It's the latest in video game technology, what creator John
Weisman calls the world's first computer sport. It also is part of
what's new in electronics _ at home and elsewhere.
   ``The desire to be Tom Cruise in Top Gun or Luke Skywalker in
Star Wars, to not have to live that experience vicariously, I think
that's a very common fantasy,'' said Weisman, president of the
Chicago-based ESP Corp., which manufactures the Battletech Center.
   Players sit in four cockpits and must act as a team in a
strategic video game simulating ground or air battles. It took
Weisman eight years to develop the game, and he plans to open the
first Battletech Center along Chicago's downtown lakefront by
March. Adventure-seekers would pay $6 for a half-hour session.
   ``It got us hooked in two minutes,'' said Brian Bayley, 27, of
St. Louis, as he and a colleague stepped out of the cockpit at the
Consumer Electronics Show, where the game made its debut in June.
   Other items for adults on display at the show included
telephones that look like bowling pins, hamburgers or fish _ a
choice of large-mouth bass, chinook salmon or walleye pike.
   For car buffs, Panasonic representatives showed systems that
project a map on the windshield to keep drivers' eyes on the road.
They also displayed camera-relayed rear and side vision on a screen
in the dashboard.
   ``You can even see videotapes, like one that shows you how to
change a tire,'' said Pat Griffis, a spokesman for Panasonic.
   And there were other hi-tech toys. A microphone changes voice
patterns to any of 16 octaves _ making it easy to mimic film
characters, including deep-voiced Darth Vader or squeaky Mickey
Mouse. The device was developed by Ohio Art Co., creators of Etch A
Sketch, and should carry a $48 price tag in retail stores by the
holiday season.
   Among the new items offered by video game giants Nintendo and
Atari are hand-held games that, unlike their predecessors, have
more advanced television-like screens. Nintendo's Game Boy, which
has a liquid crystal display, will retail at $89.95 this winter.
The Atari Advantage, which has a color screen, will sell for $140.
   Nintendo now also offers a Soviet-developed game called Tetris,
which asks a player to build a horizontal line with a series of
uneven lines and shapes.
   The company is spending about $4 million to market the game,
said Bill White, Nintendo advertising manager.
