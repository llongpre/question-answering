Arthur Gold discusses the British sense of fair play and the Hellenic view
of sport
EURIPIDES was scornful. What use to his city, he asked, is a man who wins
prizes for wrestling, running, throwing the discus or smiting jaws?
The old tragedian's cynicism was premature, perhaps. But the spirit of the
Olympic Games was indeed eventually undermined by bribery, professionalism
and politics.
The nadir came when the Emperor Nero won a gold medal in the AD 67 chariot
race in spite of being the sole contestant and failing to finish. After an
unbroken run of nearly 1,200 years (some say even longer) the Games were
abolished in the year 393.
Yet the spirit lingered on, especially in philhellene England: the Cotswold
Olympics were staged in 1636 and the Much Wenlock Olympic Society was formed
in 1850. And when Baron de Coubertin resurrected the Games in 1896 one of
the first gold medallists was a young British scholar, George Robertson, who
happened to be on holiday in Athens and submitted a Pindaric ode.
Those were the days.
What would Euripides have said if he had been at this year's winter Olympics
in Albertville and seen men in luminous zoot-suits and Darth Vader helmets
hurtle down near-vertical ski slopes at 130 mph? What verdict would he pass
on the summer Games coming up in Barcelona?
One man who has tried to shield the pure Olympic flame from polluting airs
is Sir Arthur Gold: high jumper, team leader at Mexico, Munich and Montreal,
doyen of British athletics' officials and, at 75, still chairman of the
British Olympic Association.
I asked him to define the Olympic spirit - or 'ethos' as he prefers to call
it.
'Oh, dear. You may as well ask Dr Johnson how he arrived at the meaning of
words in his dictionary]
'I tend to use 'ethos' because it's a nebulous word. Sport is a cross
between politics and religion. You can't define sport as such. And the
Olympic ethos means doing something not necessarily for profit or for
position but for the satisfaction of knowing that on that particular day you
were the best.
'It's an awfully trite thing to say, but the victory itself is a bonus on
top of doing something that you enjoy - or should enjoy.'
Sir Arthur clearly enjoyed his own athletics. In the real world, he runs the
family garage business, a repair shop and Renault franchise in north London.
(His grandfather was a hansom cab proprietor). But once established as an
international high jumper, though he missed Hitler's 1936 Olympics by a
whisker, he went on competing until the age of 43.
Adopting the Eastern Cut-off (this was before things like the Fosbury Flop
were allowed, giving jumpers another foot) he achieved a best of 6ft 3in,
and is proud of the fact that for 28 consecutive seasons he never vaulted
less than 5ft 8in.
I reminded him of the fate of the ancient Games and asked whether the modern
Olympiad was heading in the same direction.
'Sadly, we've got human nature at work. The original games lasted for more
than a thousand years; things happen much more rapidly these days. I would
have to be a great optimist to think ours would survive the intrusions of
commerce and politics for the next thousand years. I doubt it.
'There is a very real danger for the Games now. Particularly since 1984, the
International Olympic Committee has been conscious of the vast sums to be
made from sponsors and television. In the pursuit of television coverage
they may make some unwise decisions.'
By this he meant the temptation to promote sports popular on television  -
tennis, soccer, even baseball - at the expense of traditional athletics. But
these sports all have their own world championships, and the Olympics would
be second-best.
'You could find the IOC, accustomed to living in champagne style, reduced to
a ginger beer pocket.'
What, I said, do you think of events like ice dancing where it's a matter of
subjective judgment?
'Subjective sport is always a difficult issue: diving, skating, even boxing
without a knockout is subjective. It certainly calls for skill to skate, it
calls for skill to dance on skates.
'Oliver Cutts, who was involved in ballroom dancing, used to ask me: 'Why
can't ballroom dancing be an Olympic sport?' I would waffle away and say
it's not really a sport. Then he would say: 'What about ice dancing? The
only difference is the skill required to stay on skates.''
Remembering the bad press suffered by the recent winter Olympics, I asked
Sir Arthur whether the winter games were degenerate.
'Degenerate is not a word I would accept. But I think there's a real
difference.' He described how limited was people's access to winter sports,
in spite of the appearance at Albertville of bobsleigh teams from the
Caribbean.
'Now take the 100 metres. Every child at the age of eight, if not sick or
infirm, has run a race even if only at a Sunday school. So sprinters are the
best of a nation. How do you relate a gold medal for the 100 metres with a
gold medal in the bobsleigh where number two and three run like mad for 30
yards, jump in, keep their heads down and pray for the next minute . . . and
win a gold medal?'
Ideally, then, Olympic sports should be universal. But Sir Arthur goes even
further.
'The very nub is not the competition itself but the Olympic village. For two
or three weeks the cream of the world's youth share, metaphorically at
least, one roof. They learn how much they have in common. They share the
hopes, the fears. The US competitors and the Soviet Union competitors find
their rivals don't have horns or tails.'
You have been called a conservative, I said. Are you part of a dwindling
minority at the top of the Olympic movement?
Sir Arthur protested. 'I don't consider myself conservative. I prefer
'traditionalist'. I don't subscribe to the idea that all change is
necessarily for the better.
'If you ask me whether sport is to be run for the benefit of the competitors
or the benefit of those who batten on to the competitors and make fortunes
as a result, I would say sport is for those who participate.'
Sir Arthur is gold dust for sports writers because he usually comes up with
the good quote. Especially on the subject of drugs.
'It is long-term, calculated cheating,' he said. 'Fundamentally, sport is
about health and honesty and drugs are the very negation of it.'
When he protested about athletes taking body-building drugs, at the 1968
Mexico Games, he was 'laughed out of court', he says.
Is your view prevailing?
'Well, I'm an optimist. Whenever I look up and see how far we have to go I
look back and see how far we've come. The first battle is always for the
hearts and minds of men. Now very few people if any are prepared to defend
drug abuse in public. Much of the drug abuse has been eradicated.
'Remember, our task is not to detect those who do cheat, but to protect the
majority who don't cheat. If in sport you are going to allow the cheats to
prosper - we all as kids learn that cheats never prosper  - when you see a
Ben Johnson (100m gold medallist in Seoul) offered Dollars 30,000 appearance
money as world record holder but Dollars 1m for an appearance as a convicted
cheat, there is a stench about it, something that stinks.'
He agreed that for drug abuse to continue undetected required the connivance
not only of coaches but of officialdom. He had been told by a top
pharmacologist that his worst enemies were chemists in his own university
who were trying to develop undetectable drugs. ('This was not in the UK, I
hasten to add]')
This week, Boris Becker, the former Wimbledon tennis champion, was reported
as saying he would not support Berlin's bid to host the Games in the year
2000. Having been abused by neo-Nazis for going out with a coloured woman,
he was afraid that success for Germany in those Games would excite the
racists once more.
Sir Arthur agreed that in recent years countries had tried to use the Games
as an advertisement for the superiority of their system - capitalist or
communist.
But not all nationalism was inflammatory. 'I think there is pride in the
performance of one's own countrymen. I don't look upon that as a bad aspect
of nationalism.
'In a sporting sense that can be negative. But if it's an alternative to
making war, it's positive. We live in a very imperfect world. We may all
seek perfection, but we're never going to achieve it. We're human, we're
fallible and if sport can minimise a few of those failings, it's better than
nothing, isn't it?
'There's this awful English phrase 'fair play'. But we know what it means
and I think it is the very nub of the Olympic Games.'
