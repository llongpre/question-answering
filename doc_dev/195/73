<LEADPARA>  IN A studio high above the streets of Manhattan, the overweight, overwrought
and overbearing man who rarely pronounces his name without attaching the
appellation "America's most-listened-to talk-show host" is harrumphing into
his radio microphone.;    Rush Limbaugh's excited. You can tell by the sound
of a piece of paper crumpling and snapping between his hands. He's reading a
news item out of Oshkosh, Wis., about the conviction of a young man who
sexually assaulted a mentally disordered woman with 46 personalities. The host
is fascinated by the woman's claim that although one of her more outgoing
personalities consented to having sex, she was caused great distress when
another of her personalities, a 6-year-old girl, surfaced in the midst of the
incident.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This may sound like a shard of bizarre trivia, but America's
most-listened-to talk-show host knows better. So do many of the 1.3 million
folks who, according to the Arbitron ratings, are tuned in to his show on 294
stations -- including San Francisco's KNBR, 680 AM -- from 9 a.m. to noon,
Monday through Friday.;    They are listening to a self-styled
commander-in-chief fight his private "culture war" against the many liberal,
do-gooder notions that interfere with his right to eat and wear and spend
whatever he damn well wants and say whatever he damn well pleases.;    This
Wisconsin case is another example. The whole notion of multiple personalities
is so . . . untidy. It is not enough for Limbaugh to broadcast this snippet.
He must pass judgment. The fault here, he intones haughtily, the way Solomon
might have said it after assertiveness training, was the woman's. "That
6-year-old is culpable!" he says. If she knew the assault was going on, she
should have protested. "Was she too busy eating candy?";    Welcome to a world
where Howard Cosell's voice seems to have been grafted to Pat Buchanan's brain
and amplified through the cracked sensibilities of the Stanford Marching Band.
Where news items about homelessness are preceded by Clarence "Frogman" Henry's
rollicking recording of "Ain't Got No Home," a '50s rock 'n' roll hit. Where
items on animal rights are preceded by Andy Williams' "Born Free," punctuated
by the sounds of gunfire and shrieking animals. Where political essays against
creatures such as "commie-libs," "feminazis" and "environmentalist wackos"
burst forth without warning, delivered with word-swallowing urgency and enough
sarcasm to feed a small country. Where callers from cellular phones get
priority on the show's call-in line because people with enough money to own
car phones compose the only endangered species Limbaugh cares about -- rich
Republicans. Where items concerning Mikhail S. Gorbachev are presented as
"Gorbasms," a sarcastic reference to the American public's adoration of the
Soviet president. So devious does Limbaugh consider Gorbachev that he reads
these updates, which usually detail new economic chaos in the Soviet Union,
over the blaring section of the "Empire Strikes Back" soundtrack that
introduced Darth Vader.;    Mister Limbaugh's neighborhood is the hottest
place in talk radio because it is unlike any other spot on the dial, a gag-
and bombast-infested, stream-of-consciousness current-events lecture that
careens between blood-serious conservative politics and deadpan irreverence.
It is a place without any guests, a place where the host is the show, a place
where callers play second fiddle, their views meticulously screened to avoid
any sluggish or repetitive moments that might bog down the breakneck pace.;   
The show is so flat-out weird that Limbaugh affably advises new listeners that
they'll require six weeks to understand it. By then, he says, they will be
delivered to "the cutting edge of societal evolution." You will never have to
read another newspaper again, he promises with the conviction of a faith
healer. "I will do all your reading, and I will tell you what to think about
it.";    Rush Hudson Limbaugh III, who turned 40 on Jan. 11, is a
booming-voiced, 6-foot-tall, 320-pound man with thinning hair who lives a
relatively hermit-like, computer-nerd existence until show time, when he seems
to erupt into the mike. There is supreme grace and confidence to this bluster.
Yet Limbaugh was a failure through most of his broadcasting life until he did
something Americans still do best. He reinvented himself.;    Uncomfortable
with traditional restrictive radio formats, he developed one that fit his
quirky, opinionated nature and appealed to many listeners who found
conventional talk radio too predictable or ponderous. He's not the biggest
name in talk radio -- that title still goes to Larry King, who pooh-poohs
Limbaugh's style as an appeal to "the base element in us." King is a star on
CNN as well as radio -- he even made a guest appearance on CBS' "Murphy Brown"
this season -- and has significantly more stations than Limbaugh. But King
owns the less-listened-to late-night turf. Limbaugh owns the day, and after
only 2 1/2 years in national syndication he has developed an audience twice
that of King's or any other nationwide talk show.;    A proven winner; 
"Daytime syndicated talk (radio) is not a proven winner, but Rush is
different," says Eric Seidel, manager of WGST in Atlanta, which has been
carrying Limbaugh's show for the past year. "He's one of the savviest guys in
capturing the entertainment value of the medium. What Rush realizes, and what
a lot of listeners don't, is that talk-radio programming is entertainment. It
is not journalism.";    Limbaugh first proved this in Sacramento in the
mid-1980s, where he was a local hit with the same kind of show. In the spring
of 1988, a syndicator discovered him, signed him to a partnership, moved him
to Manhattan with a $250,000 annual base salary and quickly launched the
54-station "Excellence in Broadcasting" network.;    Calls and letters;  They
quickly added scores of small markets; then the bigger ones began to come
aboard. Locally, KNBR picked up the show in November and although new ratings
figures won't be available until April, it's obvious from the volume of calls
and letters that the station has a hit on its hands, say programming gurus
there.;    Last year, Limbaugh made, by his estimate, well over $500,000. He
says he'll hit a million this year.;    He wallows in it. He flies first class
to $15,000-a-pop concert appearances all over the country nearly every
weekend, working his rap on adoring crowds of 2,000 to 7,000. He markets
concert tapes and T-shirts. He sponsors Caribbean cruises for his most zealous
fans. He has been master of ceremonies at an Oliver North benefit roast in
Washington. When he took a vacation last summer, his on-air replacement was
Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., an ideological twin.;    Although half of
Limbaugh's audience is over 50 -- the classic target audience of talk radio --
he also draws a substantial number of people in their 30s and 40s who listen
while commuting or at work. It is not unusual for a caller to inform Limbaugh
that he is a regular listener who disagrees with 90 percent of the host's
politics. "I think your shtick is better than Pee-wee Herman and Jimmy
Swaggart," a guy from Toledo told Limbaugh recently when he called in. "Only
Pee-wee thinks he's being funny, and Jimmy thinks he's being serious. I
haven't figured out what you're trying to do.";    Limbaugh laughed
good-naturedly at that one. He maintains that he could not care less that a
lot of people are still confused by the program's cockeyed attitudes. Although
his conservative views, forged in a family of Republican attorneys in Cape
Girardeau, Mo., are deeply held, he never planned on becoming a right-wing
icon. His professional universe is show business. The fact that he has become
a semi-authorized conservative spokesman -- he's the guy "Nightline" booked
last November when it wanted someone to articulate citizen support of
mobilization for war with Iraq -- is merely a testament to how well Limbaugh
packages what he preaches.;    "Sixty, maybe 70 percent of my success is my
(conservative) message; I never bargained for that," he told a concert
audience in California late last year. "I am on the radio for one reason: to
attract the largest audience I can and hold it. I am not in a think tank." Yet
he swears he is sincere. He could never pose as a liberal for the sake of
ratings, he says. Too much work. Liberals never have a nice day. "They don't
have fun. They're worried about everything being wrong.";    Limbaugh has
admitted this freely on the air countless times. Of course, Limbaugh freely
admits just about everything on the air: his divorces (two), his previous
firings (way more than two), his weight (a gain of 100 pounds in the past five
years), his new home-exercise program (40 minutes on a treadmill at 3.5 mph),
his tendency to perspire heavily, the fact that he hates crowds unless he's
performing in front of them, the fact that he cried in bed the other night
watching a tape of "Field of Dreams.";    Yet for all his excesses -- indeed,
because of them -- Limbaugh has sculpted a program that is far more compelling
than either the civilized talk-show universe or the confrontational nether
world of "shock radio," in which audience and guests are routinely assaulted.
He brings an almost frightening enthusiasm to the program -- a quality that,
ironically, makes him seem boorish when he appears on the cooler medium of
television.;    The show reflects not merely Limbaugh's gotta-keep-busy
personality but also his background. He's a news junkie, a man who
overcompensates for being a college dropout by devouring and dissecting all
manner of newspapers and magazines -- he says he spends three hours reading
news and analysis before each day's show.;    He's a radio junkie who started
working as a rock 'n' roll disc jockey in the golden, pre-FM days of radio
while still a teen-ager. He maintains the art of breathlessly pacing a show,
cutting from one factoid to another without breaking stride. He's a political
junkie, delighted to interpret everything but the weather in a
liberal-vs.-conservative context. He's an attention junkie, a man who looks at
his fame with the heartfelt reverence most people reserve for their newborn
baby. He's a control junkie: The show is his, period. Callers who attempt to
duplicate the host's style of ironic humor are reminded never to try it in
their homes.;    He is not enjoying this public notion that forever plagues
him, the idea that he is insensitive. He wishes it would go away. Don't they
understand? The gags come so fast to him, and he hates to repress any of them.
Why can't he have his fun, soaring from one political diatribe to another with
as many midstream belly laughs as he can muster?;    Hey, he asks, didn't you
see the recent essay in Esquire, "The Case Against Sensitivity"? That's just
what he's been saying on the show for months -- that "sensitivity" is the new
fascism, that you can no longer make fun of "politically correct" groups. What
happened to free speech? Why doesn't everybody lighten up? Why do liberals
assume he's a racist just because he taunts every black leader from Jesse
Jackson to David Dinkins? That doesn't mean he has anything against blacks, he
insists.;    Lampooning liberals;  You want proof? OK, try this: To prove he
is not racist, Limbaugh points out that when he buys Wheaties, he always buys
the box with Michael Jordan's picture on it. Now, if you laughed at that joke,
you'll probably enjoy Limbaugh's show. If you laughed at that joke and hated
yourself for laughing, you may wind up listening to the show anyway. If you
didn't laugh, you and Limbaugh are not made for each other, and you will not
buy his defense of the Wheaties joke: "It's an element of my sense of humor.
It's not intended to lampoon blacks; it's to lampoon liberals who define
liberalism almost as phonily as that.";    In New York, Limbaugh consolidated
the call-screening rules that allow the program to sound like what a number of
radio consultants have admiringly described as a local show projected across
the country. You won't hear two consecutive calls from the same geographic
area. Nor will you hear many of the staples of other right-wing broadcasters.
Limbaugh regards them as viruses that kill off the broad audience he craves.; 
  "I don't want any John Birchers, no one-world-government theories," he says.
"No UFOs, no abortion calls in the context of when life begins, no gun control
in the 20-year-old, cliched argument, nothing from people who are going to
read anything (on the air), no Bible -- faith is a sacred and personal thing.
I don't want devout believers of any religion or cause because they don't
think. I want people who think about things with a passion. And I do not want
racists or bigots to feel they have a home on the show. It's an entertainment
show."  </TEXT>
