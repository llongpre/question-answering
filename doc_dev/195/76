   The governor on Friday declared a state
of emergency in 13 counties ravaged by severe windstorms and
flooding that left three dead, closed highways and forced thousands
of residents from water-damaged homes.
   ``The citizens of our state face millions of dollars in
damages,'' Gov. Booth Gardner said. ``Many people's entire lives
have been turned upside down. We need access to every resource
available to make repairs and to return life to normal.''
   The action triggers a state appeal to the federal government for
disaster funds.
   In Oregon, Gov. Neil Goldschmidt took an aerial tour of Clatsop
and Tillamook counties along the state's northern coast and said
the damage from the violent storms rivals that of the 1962 Columbus
Day storm, which left 35 people dead and caused $170 million in
damage.
   ``I think we just had another one,'' said the governor, who
declared a state of emergency in the two counties Tuesday.
   The three storms that battered the Pacific Northwest in the past
week were blamed for three deaths in Oregon and millions of dollars
in damage from falling trees and flooding.
   ``We're no place close to a total estimate of damage, but we'll
know a lot more by the end of next week,'' Goldschmidt said. ``We'd
like to see that everybody who deserves assistance finds some way
to get it.''
   In Washington, the Chehalis River spared Aberdeen from flooding
early Friday when high water began emptying into the ocean, leaving
an 80-mile brown swath in southwestern Washington.
   Flooding along the Chehalis and elsewhere in Washington left
three dead, forced thousands from their homes, closed highways and
caused millions of dollars in damage.
   The Chehalis crested near Aberdeen early Friday, coinciding with
an easterly wind and no more rain to spare the town from flooding,
said Rita Kepner, spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   The National Weather Service cancelled flood warnings for all
Washington rivers.
   Eight western Washington rivers jumped their banks after four
days of heavy rain, with the worst flooding along the Chehalis and
its tributaries.
   At the height of the flood, an estimated 3,000 of Lewis County's
57,000 residents were forced to leave their homes. The business
area of Centralia, 80 miles south of Seattle, was especially hard
hit.
   Royce Walls, state Transportation Department superintendent at
Chehalis, said two northbound and one southbound lane of Interstate
5 were reopened Friday after being closed by water Tuesday. Some
northbound traffic was able to use city streets to bypass the water
Thursday, but southbound motorists had a 60-mile detour over
secondary roads.
   Mudslides and washouts cut both the north-south and east-west
mainlines for Burlington Northern Railroad. Washouts were near
Vader, south of Centralia, and near U.S. 2 at Stevens Pass,
northeast of Seattle.
   The north-south Burlington Northern mainline between Seattle and
Portland was reopened Friday, after washing out Tuesday near Vader,
railroad spokesman Howard Kallio said.
   Lynn O'Conner, Grays Harbor County spokeswoman, said about half
of the 600 residents in and around Oakville and Porter had been
evacuated. Some 23 county roads in the area were under water and
impassible, officials said.
   Three people were rescued Thursday after spending the night in
the back of a dump truck that became stuck near Oakville. The truck
was loaded with wood, and Karen Layman of Centralia said she, Ron
McNeal of Centralia and Hugh Jameson of Grand Mound were able to
build a fire to keep warm.
   Damage was still being assessed, but Kate Heimbach, state
emergency management director, said losses easily will be ``several
million dollars in each county.'' She said several bridges were
lost and substantial road damage is expected.
