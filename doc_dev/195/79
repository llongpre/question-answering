   Where was President Bush the week the
Kremlin tottered?
   He was at the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command flashing
a jaunty thumbs-up from the Darth Vaderesque cockpit of a B-1
bomber and reminding missile launch crews ``the pointy end is up.''
   He was out on the dusty hills of the Mojave Desert in fatigues
and black wingtip shoes, watching Army tanks stage war games
against a Soviet-style ``foe.'' No shells; laser tag does the trick.
   He was at a weapons laboratory with a $1 billion budget outside
San Francisco, extolling Star Wars and saluting the
``underappreciated'' staff dreaming up the weapons of tomorrow.
   It was, as wags along for the ride put it, President Bush's Cold
War Victory Tour.
   Communist party chieftains in Moscow may have been talking
pluralism, but for Bush this was a week to celebrate containment,
deterrence and nuclear modernization.

   Bush also tried to talk in San Francisco about
``demobilization,'' but a memory lapse got in the way.
   After explaining foreign policy to 2,500 people at the
Commonwealth Club, Bush found himself at a loss for that one
particular word while fielding questions.
   Bush allowed that there might be a bit of a dividend down the
road from troop cutbacks in Europe.
   ``I think we will see substantial savings that are made by the _
whaddaya call it? Suddenly gone blank _ in terms of where you bring
a guy back and he's no longer in the Army?'' Bush circumlocuted as
the crowd broke into laughter.
   He never came up with the word.
   Later, aboard Air Force One, he chided reporters, ``None of you
guys gave me any help. I looked down in the front and not one of
you guys would help out. It's not going to impede your
objectivity.''
   ``I was groping up there, a terrible feeling. It was awful. Such
an easy word,'' said Bush. ``Anyway, I made another mistake (once).
Let's see, it was in 1981 ... a spelling error.''
   It wasn't just the press row that failed to help him fill in the
blank. He didn't get any help, either, from former Secretary of
State George Shultz, seated at his right hand, or California Gov.
George Deukmejian a few seats down the head table.

   Bob Hope, preceding Bush at a Los Angeles fund-raising dinner,
marveled at the president's energy.
   ``I mean, he jogs, he swims, he plays tennis, he hunts, he
pitches horseshoes _ he's got to move. I think we ought to let him
deliver the mail,'' quipped Hope.
   But Bush showed signs of tiring on this trip to California,
Nebraska and Ohio and back in 60 hours flat.
   At a fundraising breakfast in Omaha for Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr,
he wound up telling an anecdote about humorist ``Mark Train'' and
thanked the crowd ``for your support for Fay.''

   Bush was only too happy to pose for the camera in his aviator
jacket in the cockpit of a B-1 bomber at Offut, but he kept his
feet planted firmly on the ground when surrounded by tanks and
armored vehicles during the military training exercises at Fort
Irwin, a remote installation in the Mojave.
   He got close but never ventured inside, mindful of the comic
picture that Michael Dukakis, his campaign rival, cut when he took
an ill-fated tank ride during the 1988 campaign.

   Bush tries to walk a fine line between voicing support for
Gorbachev's reform efforts and trying to keep his nose out of the
other guy's internal business.
   Many of the questions from the Commonwealth Club crowd dealt
with Gorbachev. But one apparently was too much for Bush. Would he
comment, please, on Gorbachev's nomination for the Nobel Peace
Prize?
   ``I hate to say I wasn't aware of it,'' he cracked. But after
dancing around a bit, he added, ``Far be it from me to try to
influence the gurus who decide who wins a Nobel Prize.''
