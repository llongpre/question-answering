Any Star Wars buffs who ever dreamt of fighting the Rebel Alliance by flying
an Imperial starfighter under Darth Vader's command can now act out their
fantasies by buying TIE Fighter, one of the dozens of new computer games on
sale this Christmas.
TIE Fighter is the latest launch from Lucas Arts, the games subsidiary
created in the early 1980s by George Lucas, director of Star Wars, at his
state-of-the-art entertainment laboratory at San Rafael, California.
Mr Lucas, who dropped out of the Hollywood mainstream over a decade ago to
pursue his passion for technology, was a pioneer of the use of movie themes
and characters in games. His Star Wars games often feature at the top of the
computer games charts and the Hollywood studios are now racing to follow
Lucas Arts into the games sphere. Time Warner earlier this year acquired
Renegade, a games software house. New Line, the film company owned by Ted
Turner, the new-media mogul, recently formed a Dollars 30m (Pounds 18m)
joint venture with France's Havas to develop a global games business. Even
record companies are muscling into the market. Motown, the music label owned
by PolyGram, recently launched a Motown Games subsidiary.
The next convert to the games sphere is mooted to be Walt Disney, which is
expected this week to announce plans for the formation of a new interactive
entertainment division. Disney, like other studios, presently licenses its
characters for use in games devised by other companies such as Sega and
Nintendo, the Japanese games specialists.
The catalyst for Hollywood's sudden surge of interest in computer games is
the emergence of the new generation of disc-based games. The games market
has since the early 1980s been dominated by the 16-bit cartridge consoles
made by Sega and Nintendo.
For the past year or so the market has been moving towards disc-based games
played on home computers and multimedia machines that are able to play
CD-Roms, or interactive discs. Lucas Arts and other companies have already
made the most of the enhanced qualities of disc medium to create more
sophisticated games. They will be able to reach new levels of sophistication
with the next wave of change - the launch of the 32-bit and 64-bit
disc-based games, that are now being introduced in Japan and will come out
next year in the US and Europe.
These games are much more powerful than the old 16-bit cartridge consoles.
They have the capacity to create cinematic sounds and images that are
perfect vehicles for the characters and plots of Hollywood movies.
'There's no doubt that CD-Roms and the new games formats could become a
phenomenal growth market,' says Michael Lynne, president of New Line in New
York. 'All the attributes of a motion picture will soon be available on a
computer screen, so we can apply our skills to create games and informative
'edutainment' products.' New Line, like the other studios, plans to become
more aggressive at adapting its movie concepts into games. However, Randy
Komisar, president of Lucas Arts, suspects that Hollywood may have
underestimated the complexity of the games market.
'There is scope to use the techniques of movie-making in a game - we do it
all the time,' he says. 'But film is a linear medium and a game is a virtual
experience. If you take the content of a movie to use in a game, it must be
developed so that it is exciting and engaging in an interactive context.'
