   One of the world's most successful filmmakers
and a legendary film company release a $55 million cinematic gamble
on Friday with the opening of the medieval fantasy ``Willow.''
   Both George Lucas, whose ``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana Jones''
movies have grossed $1 billion, and MGM, which once was Hollywood's
greatest studio, need a hit. The movie is directed by Ron Howard,
who won acclaim with ``Splash'' and ``Cocoon.''
   Lucasfilm Ltd. has produced two expensive flops, ``Labyrinth''
and ``Howard the Duck.'' MGM, meanwhile, is struggling to regain
momentum after several reorganizations. As a further complication,
financier Kirk Kerkorian, who owns 82.4 percent of the parent
MGM@UA Communications, is seeking a buyer for the company. A
``Willow'' hit would enhance the price.
   Despite some early negative reviews for the movie, which goes
into 1,000 theaters nationwide Friday, MGM and Lucas can be proud
of their achievement. ``Willow'' is movie storytelling in the grand
tradition.
   No, it isn't a landmark film such as the ``Star Wars'' trilogy _
the kind of achievement that happens once a decade. Much of
``Willow'' may seem familiar to audiences exposed to special
effects movies of recent years or to animated classics from Disney.
   But ``Willow'' stands on its own merits as high adventure
executed with superior imagination.
   Theater owner and reviewer screenings drew mixed responses.
Daily Variety called the film ``a medieval mishmash'' but predicted
``kids will probably love it.'' Time magazine said: ``For now,
(Lucas') wonder wand is broken.'' Newsweek's headline was: ``The
Raider of Lost Art.''
   Facing blockbuster competition from ``Rambo III'' and
``Crocodile Dundee II'' on May 25, MGM prudently released
``Willow'' five days earlier.
   ``Willow'' centers on the efforts of a brave dwarf to save a
baby from the clutches of an evil queen who fears the child will
destroy her power. The hero, Willow, finds allies in an
over-the-hill knight and a pair of mischievous ``brownies'' _
creatures 9 inches tall.
   There are no major stars in the film, which features Val Kilmer
(``Top Gun''), Joanne Whalley (``Dance With a Stranger''), Jean
Marsh (``Upstairs, Downstairs'') and 19-year-old Warwick Davis as
Willow. The 3-foot-4 Davis was discovered by Lucas a few years ago
and cast as an Ewok in ``Return of the Jedi.''
   The producers count on a box-office success to help their
massive merchandising campaign. More than 30 companies have been
licensed to manufacture such items as ``Willow'' underwear, bed
sheets, lunch boxes, meal promotion at Wendy's, coloring sets, toy
action figures, computer and board games, magic tricks, records,
tapes and compact discs.
   ``Willow'' resulted from a friendship between Lucas and Howard,
who met 15 years ago when Lucas directed ``American Grafitti,''
with Howard as one of the principal actors.
   Lucas was just out of USC Film School, directing his first major
film under the sponsorship of his friend, Francis Coppola. Howard
had been an actor from the age of 5, working mostly in TV series
such as ``The Courtship of Eddie's Father,'' ``The Andy Griffith
Show'' and ``Happy Days.''
   They met again a few years ago. Howard recalled their
conversation in a recent interview:
   Lucas: ``I'd like to do a fantasy.''
   Howard: ``That's something I'd like to do.''
   Lucas: ``I've always wanted to do a story that centered on a
little person.''
   Howard: ``That's something I've always wanted to do, too. I've
always been intrigued by the idea of taking a little person or the
relationship of two little people and developing it so that 15 or
20 minutes into the picture you'd forget completely that the person
was small.''
   ``Willow'' was the result, with Lucas creating the story, Bob
Dolman writing the script and Howard directing.
   Among the director's many chores was preserving believability in
the happenings of another world.
   ``Fantasy works best when everyone involved in a project _
writer, producer, director and certainly the actors _ believe what
they're doing and try to be as honest as possible,'' Howard said.
   ``The actors really had to trust that it was OK to look at a
talking animal and play a scene just as if that creature was an
important character in your life. Gee, they all really committed to
it. That's the only way you can make a movie like this one.''
   Shooting locations for ``Willow'' ranged from the glacial
mountains of New Zealand to the craggy cliffs of Wales, with
interiors at the Elstree Studio near London.
   The cost of ``Willow'' has been reported from $35 million to $40
million, with $20 million for prints and advertising. Howard
declined to confirm the amount.
   ``This is an escapist movie, and I don't want people thinking
what it cost when a lot of soldiers charge down a mountain. When
there's an amazing special effect, I don't want them whipping out
their pocket calculators and saying, `By my estimate ...'
   ``I want them to say, `Oh, wow! What's going to happen next?'''
