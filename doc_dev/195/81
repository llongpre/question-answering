<LEADPARA>  WITH THE Cold War over and with fears of another Pearl Harbor at rest, it's
hard to remember a Thanksgiving Day when there were more reasons for the
United States to give thanks than in this second year of the last decade of
the century. But somehow there is little rejoicing. We seem to be at peace
with everybody but ourselves.;   How could this be? For 50 years since the
invention of atomic weapons, we have lived in fear of a third world war. In
the first two world wars, 70 million people were killed.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the Cold War against communism, when the two political parties finally
agreed on a non-partisan foreign policy, we avoided a war. Surely this was a
cause for rejoicing, but that's not the way it is.;   Instead, we are engaged
in a series of mean and nasty arguments over abortion, racial politics, the
cost of credit cards, who's to be blamed for the economic recession and
unemployment, and what's the matter with George Bush and Gov. Mario Cuomo of
New York.;   You might have thought that at least for this one holiday week
the president would have brought a sense of historical perspective to the
national debate. But in this year, when the "evil empire" collapsed, he
proposed a five-year military budget that, in constant dollars, would be 25
percent higher than 20 years ago, at the height of the Cold War.;   No
opposition party can really compete with the president in changing the thought
of the nation during such a revolution in world affairs. As Woodrow Wilson
said, the president's "is the only national voice in affairs. Let him once win
the admiration and confidence of the country and no other single force can
withstand him. His is the vital place of action in the system.";   President
Bush seemed to sense the truth of this for a time, and talked of "a new world
order," which he started with a war that took the lives of more than 150,000
Iraqis and Kurds, which he barely mentioned.;   There was a kind of jingoistic
rejoicing after the painful liberation of Kuwait, but since then the object of
his policies seems to have been his own re-election, and the Democrats have
responded with their own brand of bush league politics.;   Accordingly, it's
easy to understand why the American people are not rejoicing this Thanksgiving
Day, for they are also suffering from the consequences of these wars, hot and
cold.;   While paying for the threats to their security from abroad --
necessary as those payments were -- their children have been shortchanged in
the schools; the problems of crime, drug abuse, health insurance and
compassion for the homeless have been under-financed, if not neglected; and
the nation's industries, once the envy of the world, have been losing their
lead to our former enemies, Germany and Japan, whose budgets concentrate, not
on military defense, but on research and development for products that are
competing with ours and often beating us in world trade.;   In short, we have
changed the world, but haven't changed our minds, and this is not surprising.;
  For if the people are told for more than 12 years by their leaders that they
should think about themselves and their own special interests, that they can
spend their way to prosperity and happiness with borrowed money and that
government is not the answer but the cause of all their problems, you
shouldn't be surprised if the people are disappointed in the pursuit of
greediness, and ask, after their sacrifices in the Cold War and Operation
Desert Storm, "Where's the rainbow?"; James Reston is former chief Washington
correspondent and executive editor of the New York Times.; By Rheta Grimsley
Johnson;    I REMEMBER the world before calories and cholesterol, when mothers
who fed their children cold lunches -- ipso facto bad mothers -- had to be
defensive about serving peanut butter sandwiches.;   My own dear mother
subscribed to the hot food/good mother theory. If it was smoking, it was good
for you. Cold food indicated a mother too lazy to cook and a meal not fit to
eat. Ah, the innocent days of hot meals and Howdy Doody.;   It turns out
though that peanut butter is good; fried chicken is bad. Or so say the
experts, delivering the nettlesome news of the 1990s. Everyone these days is
an expert. Just hold a little war and watch the experts crawl out of the
woodwork onto the television screen.;   On Thanksgiving, rich with cholesterol
and salmonella, I'm thankful to remember eating before it was hazardous to
your health.;   I'm also thankful for mind-altering drugs like Tylenol and
granulated sugar, and for restaurants like the one run by Mississippian Norma
Vandiver, who still pre-sweetens tea and puts gravy on the mashed potatoes.;  
I'm thankful Louisiana voters repudiated David Duke, who, considering the
collective IQ of his followers, should be grateful his name had only the one
syllable. "Duke Duke Duke.";   I'm glad the pompous foghorn Pat Buchanan is
running for president if it means he won't be on "Crossfire" anymore. Maybe
he'll even hire a makeover artist to change the oil in his hair.;   And that
the USSR is now the USS, not the Evil Empire, though that moniker had a
certain Darth Vaderish appeal.;   I appreciate the eternal youthfulness of
Paul Newman, whose only unbelievable roles in a long and distinguished career
have been the ones in which he played codgers.;   I'm grateful for having a
job in these recessionary times, a job that provides a roof and three squares
and keeps me from watching too much daytime trash TV, shows featuring Sally
refereeing sisters who dated one another's husbands, or Joan quizzing
post-operative transsexuals about lingering male characteristics.;   I'm
thankful for getting to travel to Europe and learn the truth about "those
dirty unisex toilets," which can't hold a candle to one at any Arkansas gas
station.;   I'm glad the sequel to "Gone With The Wind" is getting universally
bad reviews, even if it is making its unscrupulous author, Alexandria Ripley,
filthy rich.;   And that so far only one well-known movie reviewer has
mentioned Meryl Streep as a candidate for the part of an older, wiser Scarlett
O'Hara. Roger Ebert (also known as "the fat one, not the snooty one")
suggested Meryl, citing her "credible" Southern accent in one of her early
movies about politics, which was possibly the most overdone drawl in moviedom,
except for Sally Field in "Norma Rae.";   I'm thankful the Atlanta Braves made
it to the World Series, with or without the politically hot chop, which, by
the way, was found objectionable only by Native Americans from Minnesota.;  
And I'm glad that most of the women I know thought Clarence Thomas protested
too much.;   Each year, I appreciate my friends more, the ones who have heard
all my stories and my gushing Willie Nelson speech and still come to see me
every now and then.;   I am thankful for health, relative wealth, Mahalia
Jackson Christmas music, bitchy Florence King essays, my family, my dog, my
Ford and editorial page editors who will run someone other than George Will.  </TEXT>
