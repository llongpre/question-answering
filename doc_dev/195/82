   This potato-farming community of about 600
is facing insolvency after being ordered to pay $50,000 to settle a
decade-old lawsuit by a pool-hall owner arrested for opening on a
Sunday.
   Town Attorney Winston Jacobo told the Town Council it has been
ordered to pay by 4 p.m. Tuesday or the council members will be
held in contempt of court.
   Jacobo told council members they have about $65,000 available
but also have unrelated bills totaling $31,000.
   ``If you vote to pay it the settlement, you vote to make the
town insolvent,'' Jacobo said. ``We don't have the money to pay.''
   The council authorized Jacobo to ask attorneys for George
Pierce, the pool-hall owner, to accept $20,000 now and $10,000 a
year until the debt is paid.
   Alternatives would be for the town to declare bankruptcy or ask
the Legislature to take away the town's charter.
   If the town becomes insolvent, Jacobo said the state might pull
the town's charter anyway.
   About 75 people crammed into Town Hall late Wednesday to find
out whether Hastings could remain solvent.
   One resident, Dartha Marshall, said none of the council members
were in city government when the arrest was made and should not be
held accountable. She blamed former Mayors Jody Bateman and Greg
Maltby and the former town attorney for the problem.
   In 1978, Pierce, now 52, was arrested for operating his game
room on a Sunday afternoon, in violations of a local law.
   County Judge Robert Andreu threw out the charges, and Pierce
filed a lawsuit. He claimed he lost $100,000 in business from the
incident.
   A jury awarded him $44,000 in 1981, but a judge reduced it to
$23,800. Later, a new trial was ordered and this time, in 1984, a
jury awarded him $65,000.
   Some payments have been made, but the town still owes almost
$50,000.
