</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Southern California Water Co.'s Foothill Division is offering free water 
conservation kits to its customers in Claremont, San Dimas and Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Citing drought conditions, the company's district superintendent, Kenneth 
Vader, said: "We're sending a clear message that we encourage both residents 
and businesses to do whatever possible to eliminate water waste. . . . Our 
water shortage is real." 
</P>

The kits include toilet tank bags that displace water and can save hundreds of 
gallons of water annually. The company is also giving away devices that 
restrict the flow of water in shower heads and dye tablets that help detect 
toilet leaks.

Information on the kits and water-saving techniques is available by calling
