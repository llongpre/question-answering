  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 26 -- General Secretary Do Muoi 
received here today a delegation of the Cuban National Bank led 
by its First Vice President Osvaldo Torres who is here for a 
visit to Vietnam. 
  Speaking at the guests, General Secretary Do Muoi spoke 
highly of the promotion of the exchange of experience and 
cooperation in various fields between the banking services of 
the two countries. He said he considered their visit as an 
important contribution to furthering the close friendship, 
solidarity and cooperation between the two parties, governments 
and peoples. Mr. Muoi reaffirmed that the party, the government 
and the people of Vietnam consistently support Cuba's 
revolutionary cause and wished the Cuban people under the 
leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba led by President Fidel 
Castro greater success in overcoming difficulties and trials, 
firmly defending their revolution, and taking it forward. 
  For his part, Mr. Osvaldo Torres noted that the achievements 
recorded by the Vietnamese people in the process of renovation 
were the source of encouragement to the Cuban people in 
overcoming difficulties and trails in order to defend their 
revolutionary achievements, thus bringing the country toward 
socialism. 
  Also present at the reception were Vietnam State Bank 
Governor Cao Si Kiem, deputy head of the External Relations 
Commission of the CPV Central Committee Nguyen Van Son and Cuban 
Embassy Charge Affaires A.I. Ruben Vades.
