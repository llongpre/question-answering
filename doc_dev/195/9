The force was definitely with John Williams and George Lucas this week. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen years after film maker Lucas first pitted Luke Skywalker, Princess 
Leia and Han Solo against Darth Vader, he invited his favorite movie composer 
to his sumptuous 3,000-acre Skywalker Ranch in the rolling hills of Marin 
County for a two-day "Star Wars" taping session. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, about to enter his 11th year as conductor of the Boston Pops, briskly 
and congenially led a hand-picked ensemble of 95 Northern California musicians 
through the recording of 13 selections from the blockbuster film trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting compact disc, the first digital recording of "Star Wars" tracks, 
is scheduled to be released by Sony Classical Productions this fall. 
</P>
<P>
For Williams, 58, less press-shy than the reclusive Lucas, the project is 
particularly poignant. The original "Star Wars" sound track, recorded in 1977 
at the defunct Denham Studios' Anvil scoring stage near London, won the 
composer one of his four Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
According to Williams, it was when Lucas learned that the British studio would 
be torn down that he got the idea to build his own world-class facility, over 
the objections of underlings who deemed it too ambitious and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Untold millions of dollars later, Williams and the Skywalker Symphony, as the 
collection of free-lance musicians is called, reaped the benefits Monday and 
Tuesday as the sounds of "Princess Leia's Theme" and other melodies 
reverberated through the 30-foot-high room. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a treat to see George's dream be realized," Williams said during a lunch 
break, pointing out the state-of-the-art "mixing" console and the studio's 
undulating mauve walls and ceiling, where panels can be shifted to change the 
acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the gaggle of performers, engineers and production people imported for 
the session agreed that Lucas, a legendary big thinker, and the studio's 
designer, Tomlinson Holman (also the developer of the THX "The Audience Is 
Listening" movie-theater sound system), had outdone themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no doubt one of the finest studios in the world," said Mark Genfan, an 
engineer with Sony Classical Productions in New York. Even so, Sony brought in 
its own sophisticated recording equipment, including a machine that records 48 
separate tracks on a half-inch tape. 
</P>
<P>
At midday, producer Thomas Z. Shepard said with a disappointed sigh that the 
project would wrap up by late afternoon, absolutely on schedule and too 
speedily to suit him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stay here a month," said Shepard, who flew in from New York and 
was one of the lucky ones staying on the premises. "I've never yearned for 
inefficiency so much." 
</P>
<P>
Skywalker Ranch, headquarters of Lucasfilm Ltd., covers nearly 3,000 of Lucas' 
4,700 bucolic acres, of which 95% has been permanently dedicated to open space. 
</P>
<P>
The main offices are in what appears to be a large white Victorian mansion, 
with big front porch, gingerbread trim, leaded glass doors and redwood 
paneling. Although the place looks fit for a king, no one lives full-time on 
the ranch. But during the day, the ranch is home to about 150 employees who 
work in post-production, licensing and other of Lucas' busy divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old recording studio -- which has been used by such diverse 
performers as Bobby McFerrin, Huey Lewis &amp; the News, the Grateful Dead and 
the American Baroque Ensemble -- is housed down the road in the brick and wood 
Tech Building. It was built to look like a winery, complete with fledgling 
vineyard, and faces an artificial lake where ducks and egrets splash. Lucas 
installed the lake for fire protection; the ranch has its own firefighting 
squad and two shiny red firetrucks. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas has scattered throughout the buildings an impressive collection of French 
movie posters, paintings by such artists as Norman Rockwell and Maxfield 
Parrish and memorabilia from his movies, including a model of Yoda, the wise 
Jedi master who taught Luke Skywalker how to use "the force" to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The "Star Wars" taping was a reunion for the Skywalker Symphony, which was 
first assembled from various Bay Area groups for Linda Ronstadt's Grammy 
Award-winning album "Cry Like a Rainstorm -- Howl Like the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who lives with his wife, Samantha, in Westwood when he is not touring 
with the Boston Pops, said he was impressed with the orchestra's skill. "We're 
rehearsing on the spot," said the composer, dressed casually in black pullover, 
gray slacks and running shoes. "It's going very well." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Star Wars," "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi," 
Williams and Lucas have worked together on the "Indiana Jones" trilogy directed 
by Steven Spielberg, another longtime Williams associate ("Jaws," "Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind," "E.T."). 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was executive producer of last year's "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade," for which Williams' music has been nominated for an Oscar. (The 
prolific Williams, who spends about three months on each score, is also up for 
an Academy Award Monday for "Born on the Fourth of July.")
