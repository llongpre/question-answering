<HEAD>Friends Of Death Row Inmate Fail In Supreme Court Bid</HEAD>

   Five friends of an Illinois death row inmate
who says he does not want to pursue any more appeals suffered a
Supreme Court setback today in their attempt to keep him alive.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the five lack
the proper legal standing to challenge Illinois' death penalty law
in behalf of convicted murderer Charles Walker.
   A state jury in 1983 sentenced Walker to death after he pleaded
guilty to killing Sharon Winker and Kevin Paule in St. Clair County.
   Walker later decided to abandon all appeals, saying that he
wanted to be executed.
   Three separate court hearings were conducted, and in each Walker
was found to be mentally competent to waive his right to further
appeals.
   But five friends who sought to carry on Walker's legal fight
contend that the conditions of his death row imprisonment, coupled
with chronic alcoholism, have caused him involuntarily to waive
further appeals.
   A federal judge threw out the appeal filed by Walker's friends,
ruling that they did not have standing. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals upheld the dismissal last March 15.
   Walker's friends told the justices, ``The 7th Circuit's failure
to evaluate any prudential considerations in favor of finding that
(the five) have standing ... will permit an execution under a
statute of highly suspect validity before full review by the
courts.''
   But just last week, the justices ruled in an Arkansas case that
all others lack the proper legal standing to appeal a death
sentence not challenged by a mentally competent defendant.
   The five who filed the appeal acted on today are Miriam Wilson,
Nadine Schnurstein, Ronald Barrow, Gloria Abbey-Lyles and Patricia
Vader.
   The case is Wilson vs. Lane, 89-81.
