I SAW ESAU edited by Iona and Peter Opie, illustrated by Maurice Sendak
Walker Books Pounds 9.99, 160 pages
SIR Walter Scott was greatly troubled by the initial response from scholars
and men of letters to his proposal in 1832 that he produce a work on fairy
tales. Wasn't such a thing beneath the dignity of a great literary man such
as himself? The consequence was that he found himself obliged to make it 'a
neat thing' that would be 'obnoxious to ridicule'. This story is told in the
preface to a book entitled The Classic Fairy Tales, published almost 20
years ago by Iona and Peter Opie. If the study of children's literature in
our day is no longer felt to be beneath contempt, we have in part the Opies
to thank.
Over the past 40 years, Iona and Peter Opie have made an inestimable
contribution  - in such books as The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren
(1959), The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (1951) and Tail Feathers
from Mother Goose (1988)  - to our understanding of the relationship between
literature and the oral tradition in so far as it relates to the world of
childhood. Assiduous folklorists, they have been the Brothers Grimm of our
times; and their studies have always been enlivened by a characteristic
mixture of childish curiosity and academic rigour, humour and seriousness.
This month sees the publication of I Saw Esau, a remarkable collaboration
between the Opies and the acclaimed illustrator of children's books, Maurice
Sendak, author of Where the Wild Things Are, In the Night Kitchen and many
other award-winning titles.
Sendak's most revolutionary work was first published in the 1960s, and it
was shocking for its lack of sentimentality. Sendak set that whole
generation of children's illustrators a positive example by confronting
childhood fears head on  - the fear of the dark; the fear of monsters; the
fear of feeling helpless and small in a world of giants. Somehow his
illustrations managed to tame, normalise, and even to domesticate such
anxieties. You might even say that he was at one with all those efforts that
have been made in the 20th century  - by psychoanalysis, surrealism and much
else  - to bring about a fruitful, healing accommodation between the world
of fantasy and everyday reality.
The new book has a curious history. The Opies gathered these rhymes in the
immediate aftermath of the Second World War, and the collection was
published in a small, limited edition  - paper was strictly rationed in
those days. One copy alone survived from that printing, tucked away in the
back of a cupboard. Forty years later it was rediscovered and shown to
Maurice Sendak in New York who, enthused by the content, agreed to
illustrate it.
This collection of 170 rhymes is subtitled 'The schoolchild's pocket book'
and it is indeed a vade mecum, a book for all occasions, zestful, humorous,
but also savage and macabre. There are rhymes of insult and retaliation;
rhymes of teasing and repartee; counting rhymes, skipping rhymes; tongue
twisters, riddles and general teasers; lashings of nonsense and bamboozling
circular narratives.
Sendak has illustrated it in zestful colour throughout, enthusiastically
filling up every available inch of blank space with illustrations small,
medium and large  - squawling babies; shrieking maids in mob caps; horned
ogres with vast, cavernous mouths; leaping dogs and cavorting donkeys; and
everywhere, those rumbustious children in rags and tatters and big top hats,
fleeing, skipping, jumping, cartwheeling off the edge of the page. There are
as many different kinds and style of illustration as there are subjects to
match and fishes in the seas.
What never fails to charm and surprise us about the collection itself is the
fact that there is such a demonstrable continuity between past and present.
Among the nonsense verses we find the following familiar lines, for example:
One fine day in the middle of the night / Two dead men got up to fight / A
blind man came to see fair play / A dumb man came to shout hurray.
A note to the rhyme informs us that this is one of the oldest forms of
nonsense, and then goes on to cite an amusement that was jotted down in the
notebook of a minstrel in 1480. The translation reads as follows: I saw
three headless (men) / playing at ball / A handless man served / them all /
While three mouthless (men) / sang and howled / Three legless (men) / drove
them away . . .
Rhymes may die for whole generations, it seems, then mysteriously reappear
in a slightly modified form elsewhere. Like the thistles in Ted Hughes's
fine poem of that name, they come fighting back over the same ground,
vigorous as ever. In this book, they are part of the schoolchild's armoury
 -a way of overcoming fear and embarrassment, a magical means of
incapacitating the school bully with mere words. And mere words, of course,
endure.
