   Dashing amid movies about Vietnam, the Cold
War, nuclear war, ivory poaching and the Watts race riot of 1965,
James Earl Jones has had a busy year.
   He has also been dashing among countries, He stopped off briefly
in Los Angeles between Thailand and Kenya to talk about one of
those movies, NBC's ``Last Flight Out.''
   ``Last Flight Out'' tells of the heroic efforts to evacuate
hundreds of Vietnamese and Americans on the last civilian plane out
of Saigon before the city's fall in April 1975. NBC broadcasts the
movie Tuesday.
   Jones plays Al Topping, the Pan American station manager at Tan
Son Nhut air base in Saigon, the head executive for the airline in
Vietnam and Cambodia. Richard Crenna is Dan Hood, a Pan Am pilot
who helped evacuate some of the people.
   Jones spent three weeks filming the movie at the U-Tapao air
base in Thailand, which was one of three B-52 bomber bases in the
Vietnamese war. It stood in for Tan Son Nhut in Saigon.
   He spoke earnestly of what he learned in his research for the
role.
   ``That last flight brought out all the airline's employees'' as
well as the Vietnamese who might not otherwise have escaped, he
said.
   Jones said that people faked wounds and wore phony plaster casts
to get on the flight, and the ground crew even crawled into the
unpressurized luggage compartments and wheel wells so as not to be
left behind.
   Jones described Topping as a sure and secure person.
   ``That was all the audacity he needed,'' he said. ``He didn't
have to bully. That's how I tried to play him. He was a man sitting
on a volcano, but he's not yielding to it. He's calm. He had sent
his wife home on the flight the night before.
   ``The Pan Am chairman told him he was on the scene and he had to
make the decision. He said, `If you're too early you won't get the
Pan Am people out.' When I played that scene I did a little facial
grimace. I don't know if Al Topping would have done that. He would
have stayed stony-faced. But I did it for the sake of irony because
of the tough situation he was in.''
   The movie also stars Oscar winner Haing S. Ngor (``The Killing
Fields''), Arliss Howard, Eric Bogosian, Rosalind Chao, Elizabeth
Lindsey, Barry Corbin and Molly Hagen.
   Jones will also be seen this month in ``By Dawn's Early Light''
on Home Box Office, playing an Air Force general trying to prevent
World War III when the Soviet Union and the United States
mistakenly launch nuclear missiles. He co-stars with Powers Boothe,
Rebecca De Mornay, Martin Landau, Darren McGavin, Peter MacNicol
and Rip Torn.
   After ``Last Flight Out,'' Jones flew to Kenya for a cameo role
in ``The Last Elephant,'' a Turner Network Television movie
starring John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini. Jones plays a police
inspector investigating poaching.
   ``I did the narration for the Discovery Channel's `Ivory Wars,'
which was about poaching and merchandising illegal ivory,'' he
said. ``Kenya has taken a stand to stop poaching by burning piles
of confiscated ivory. I was in Zimbabwe, which has a well-managed
elephant control program. I brought back some ivory from Zimbabwe,
but I had to have a stack of certificates showing that it was not
poached.''
   Jones is currently working on TNT's ``Heat Wave,'' a movie about
the 1965 Watts riot in Los Angeles. He plays Junius Johnson, a
Watts community leader who tries to stop the violence that spread
through seven days of rioting.
   ``Heat Wave'' also stars Blair Underwood as Robert Richardson,
who became the first black reporter for the Los Angeles Times and
helped the newspaper win a Pulitzer Prize. Cecily Tyson portrays
Richardson's grandmother.
   The two TNT movies will be shown in August.
   Jones also has a small role as an admiral who's the liaison
between the Navy and the Central Intelligence Agency in ``The Hunt
for Red October,'' and co-stars with Eric Roberts in a new
theatrical film ``Into Thin Air.''
   That's six movies for Jones, and the year isn't half over yet.
