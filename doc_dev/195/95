   In the pageantry of the roll call of states, it
almost seemed that delegates to the Democratic National Convention
had a decision to make. They didn't, but that's show business.
   And show business is what national political conventions have
become. They are unrivaled as the greatest shows in American
politics. Their central decisions are made in advance, far from the
convention hall, by voters, not delegates.
   Nowadays, conventions are scripted and scheduled to the minute.
While the schedules seldom work, the schedulers try to enforce
them, the better to play to national television. Convention roles,
from keynote speaker to alternate delegate, reward and recognize
party leaders and workers.
   They bring together the disparate, sometimes conflicting
elements which in coalition, make up the Democratic and Republican
parties. Only then do northeastern liberals sit in side-by-side
unity, if not always in full accord, with Sun Belt conservatives.
   So Jesse Jackson makes his peace with the ticket he wanted to
lead, then join, and while some of his delegates grumble, they
nonetheless agree that Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
are more to their taste than Vice President George Bush and the
running mate he has yet to name.
   For a week or so, every fourth year, there really is a national
Democratic Party and a Republican Party people can see and
identify. That's important in a process built around a two-party
system that exists because it evolved, not because it was written
down anywhere.
   Modern conventions don't call the tunes, they dance to the music.
   In Atlanta, delegates caucused and convention whips counted
heads, all as though there were something still to be settled.
There wasn't, but the exercise proceeded as it always does.
   Dukakis sealed his Democratic presidential nomination on June 7,
capturing a delegate majority six weeks before the convention. The
nomination was a ritual. Dukakis got 2,876.25 votes, Jackson
1,218.5. Then, on a motion from the Jackson side, the convention
made it unanimous.
   Republicans will conduct a similar rite on Aug. 17 in New
Orleans, formally awarding the nomination Vice President George
Bush captured for certain on April 26. Bush is unopposed.
   Not since 1952 has a national convention taken more than one
ballot to name its nominee. Adlai E. Stevenson won the Democratic
nomination on a third ballot that year, defeating then-Sen. Estes
Kefauver of Kentucky, who had won the presidential primaries but
couldn't make it stick.
   Now primaries rule and conventions ratify.
   There was pre-season speculation that this time might be
different, that a divided Democratic field might deadlock the
primaries and therefore the convention, forcing multiple ballots
and opening the way for a late-blooming candidate. That never was a
realistic prospect. The primary election arithmetic precludes it.
   At the next Democratic convention there will be even less
delegate leeway. In a concession to Jackson, the Democrats agreed
to tie 1992 delegate votes even more tightly to the primary
election numbers.
   Four Republican conventions ago, when then-President Richard M.
Nixon was renominated in 1972, a minute-by-minute convention script
leaked out, to the consternation of the GOP leadership. It outlined
a clockwork convention, with ``spontaneous demonstrations''
included and timed to the minute. Republicans were embarrassed to
have their make-believe spontaneity unveiled.
   There's no embarrassment about such matters now. Convention
scripts are released in advance. They seldom make the timetable,
but they try. The nominating session ran about an hour behind
schedule.
   Presidential nominees used to stage-manage some suspense into
the proceedings by waiting until the final day before naming a
running mate. It wasn't publicly discussed in advance. Bad form.
   Not in Atlanta. Dukakis announced his choice of Bentsen for vice
president six days before the convention. The 1984 ticket also was
complete before the convention began.
   But the show goes on, a political extravaganza tailored for
television. Not even the delegates are essential. Some of them were
kept out along with late-arriving spectators and journalists when
the fire department decreed that the hall was overcrowded and
barred access during the Tuesday and Wednesday night sessions.
Anyone who wasn't in by mid-evening wasn't admitted.
   ``This is not a superdome,'' said Democratic Chairman Paul G.
Kirk Jr. ``For all intents and purposes, it's a live TV studio.''
   The Atlanta Omni normally seats 16,237, and that doesn't include
the floor where the delegates are sitting. For the convention,
capacity is 11,000. A grandiose, multi-tiered platform from which
convention business is conducted takes a big bite out of the
convention floor space. If the thing could fly, it would look like
a ``Star Wars'' space ship worthy of Darth Vadar.
   Between the monster platform and the proliferation of broadcast
booths and press stands, the Democrats are meeting in a shrunken
room.
   Kirk said the overcrowding that led to the closed convention
doors had nothing to do with the size of the hall. He said there
were too many people.
   ``If you like being crammed in like a sardine, it's a pretty
nice place to be,'' said Texas Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle.
   Then again, if you don't like being crammed in like a sardine,
it is best to steer clear of national conventions.
