<LEADPARA>  QUESTION: Is it true there'll be a "Hart to Hart" reunion movie? If so, please
provide as much information as possible.;   ANSWER: From what Robert Wagner
and Stefanie Powers say, there seems little chance at this time that a "Hart
to Hart" reunion movie will get off the ground. They are planning to re-team
in another TV movie, however -- a CBS drama that will have them as characters,
married to others, who get involved in an affair that leads to heartache.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q: I say Peter Sellers won the Best Actor Academy Award for "Being There."
My friend insists he won for the first "Pink Panther" movie. Who is right?;  
A: Neither of you. Despite his many remarkable performances in films ranging
from "Dr. Strangelove" to "What's New, Pussycat?" Sellers never received an
Oscar.;   Q: I have heard rumors about a new "Star Wars" movie being made. I
would appreciate any information you can get.;   A: Although George Lucas says
he's planning another "Star Wars" trilogy of films -- this one taking place
long before Han Solo, Princess Leia, et. al. are born -- it's not going to
happen for years. Lucas is busy right now on his "Young Indiana Jones
Chronicles" for ABC. The upcoming series is being shot on exotic locales
around the world. Word from Lucasfilm has it that he is trying out some new
sort of production methods for "Chronicles" (not surprisingly, they won't talk
specifics) and "if it works, it will have a bearing on whether or not he'll go
into the next 'Star Wars' trilogy." Lucas is also working on the "Red Tails"
movie he plans to produce next year about the first squadron of black fighter
pilots in W.W. II.;   Q: Any chances for "Dick Tracy" sequel?;   A: A sequel
is highly doubtful, to say the least. Disney has gone on record as saying that
the first one didn't turn out to be as profitable as had been hoped.;   Q: I
have heard many references to the Fatty Arbuckle scandal through the years,
but have never seen one of his movies. Can you provide a list?;   A: Roscoe
"Fatty" Arbuckle starred mainly in two-reelers in the silent screen era --
including many of Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops pictures. His credits are too
numerous to list, but one highlight is 1913's "A Noise From the Deep," in
which he is said to be the first person on film to be struck in the face with
a custard pie. Arbuckle had an extremely successful career (He was one of the
kings of comedy, with a palatial Beverly Hills estate, a Rolls Royce and a
$25,000 custom-made Pierce Arrow) , but then came the San Francisco hotel
"orgy" death of actress Virginia Rappe. He was accused of rape and
manslaughter, and the scandal killed his career -- despite the fact he was
acquitted (after three trials). He died in obscurity in 1933.  </TEXT>
