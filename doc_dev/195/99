   A state of emergency was declared and federal officials today
planned to tour areas of Washington state hit hard by flooding and
high winds from three back-to-back Pacific storms.
   Oregon officials also continued assessing destruction from the
storms, which killed at least six people in the two states, closed
interstate highways and rail lines and drove hundreds from homes
damaged by toppling trees and flooding.
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner on Friday declared a state of
emergency in 13 counties. Today's tour by Federal Emergency
Management Agency officials was planned in anticipation of
Gardner's asking President Bush to declare the counties a disaster
area and release federal aid.
   In Oregon, Gov. Neil Goldschmidt on Friday flew over two
northern coastal counties, Clatsop and Tillamook, that he had
declared emergency areas as the last of three storms rolled through
on Tuesday.
   He compared damage from the storms to that from the 1962
Columbus Day storm, which left 35 people dead and caused $170
million in damage.
   ``I think we just had another one,'' Goldschmidt said.
   ``We're no place close to a total estimate of damage, but we'll
know a lot more by the end of next week,'' Goldschmidt said. ``We'd
like to see that everybody who deserves assistance finds some way
to get it.''
   Insurance officials in Oregon said earlier this week they had
received damage claims totaling at least $12.5 million; Washington
officials estimated damage at more than $7 million.
   The American Red Cross was keeping disaster service centers open
during the weekend in all 13 Washington counties where Gardner
declared emergencies.
   ``The citizens of our state face millions of dollars in
damages,'' Gardner said. ``Many people's entire lives have been
turned upside down. We need access to every resource available to
make repairs and to return life to normal.''
   Many residents in the hardest-hit areas, along the Chehalis
River in Lewis, Thurston and Grays Harbor counties, were just
starting to return home Friday. An estimated 4,000 people in Lewis
County alone were affected by the flooding, with 400 evacuated.
   Kate Heimbach, state emergency management director, said early
damage estimates total at least $7.2 million.
   Interstate 5 was reopened Friday at Chehalis, about 85 miles
south of Seattle, after the river flooded the freeway Tuesday.
   The north-south Burlington Northern main line between Seattle
and Portland was reopened Friday after washing out Tuesday near
Vader, railroad spokesman Howard Kallio said.
   In Lewis County, about 175 people still remained in shelters or
motels Friday, state officials said. The airport remained flooded,
with 32 planes damaged, the state said.
   King County, where mudslides and water damaged homes, roads and
an apartment house, estimated its damage at more than $5 million.
Pierce County, where roads, bridges and more than 150 homes were
damaged, pegged its losses at $1.5 million.
