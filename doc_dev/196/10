   The dark figure who visits Edgar Allan Poe's
grave every year was captured on film by a photographer who used
surveillance equipment to snap the only known picture of the annual
rite.
   But the identity of the man remains a mystery worthy of Poe, the
patriarch of American mystery writers. The photographer did not
approach the shadowy figure or try to spoil his secret.
   Every Jan. 19 since at least 1949, on the anniversary of Poe's
birthday, someone has left three roses and a bottle of cognac on
the writer's grave. Poe died in Baltimore in 1849.
   Life magazine, in the July issue that hit newsstands Monday,
includes a picture of the figure during his early-morning visit.
   Bill Ballenberg, a free-lance photographer in New York, spent
$17,000 from Life to rent infra-red, night-vision equipment, which
he set up facing Poe's original grave and the monument he rests
beneath.
   When the darkly clad visitor appeared at the grave at 3 a.m.,
Ballenberg took the picture by a remote radio signal from inside
Westminster Hall, the Presbyterian church that overlooks the
graveyard.
   ``We had about 30 seconds. It was really fast. It was like 12
hours of boredom punctuated by 30 seconds of terror,'' Ballenberg
said in a telephone interview Monday.
   Jeff Jerome, curator of the Edgar Allen Poe House, allowed the
photographer and a magazine writer to wait with him for the visitor
last Jan. 19, the 181st anniversary of the writer's birth. The two
agreed not to try to nab, identify, talk to or otherwise disturb
the visitor.
   The picture shows the back of a man kneeling at the grave where
Poe was buried for 26 years. Because the photo was taken with a
nightscope, which intensified the available light 35,000 times, the
somewhat fuzzy photo shows only the visitor and the grave within a
circle of light.
   ``I could see his body. I never could see his face. No one could
see his face. He had a hat and a scarf pulled up well around his
face, securing his face,'' Ballenberg said.
   Poe died at the age of 40 after being discovered in a delirium
on a Baltimore street in 1848. He had stepped off a steamer and was
en route to New York after visiting his childhood sweetheart in
Richmond, Va.
   The circumstances of his death remain unclear. Some researchers
of Poe attributed his state to a fever; others pointed to the late
stages of alcoholism and a deteriorating mind.
   For 26 years, Poe's remains lay under a medium-sized stone in
the graveyard. A larger monument was erected in front of the
downtown burial ground and he was reinterred in 1875.
   Jerome, who became curator in 1979 and began the overnight
vigils, has been accused of orchestrating the visits, which he
denies. But he said he uses the publicity and annual birthday
celebrations to draw attention to the works of the writer.
   Witnesses' accounts indicate that several different men have
brought the cognac and roses in the 40 years since the offerings
were spotted by the church curator.
   No one else will be allowed to photograph the mysterious
visitor, Jerome said.
   ``This was a once in a lifetime chance.''
