   Even with sales of over 30 million books,
Frederick Forsyth, the author of ``The Day of the Jackal'' and
``The Fourth Protocol,'' insists he does not like to write.
   ``It's partly because I'm not a compulsive writer, like some of
my colleagues,'' explained the 50-year-old British author. ``I try
and take a period off between books and do something that has
nothing do do with books.''
   When Forsyth does force himself to the typewriter, he maintains
a strict schedule: rise around 7 a.m., at his desk by 8, reread the
previous chapters, start writing at 9, continue until his daily
ration of 12 pages is completed.
   The books usually take 4-5 months to research, 6-7 weeks to
write and arrive faithfully every 5 years. The results are just as
predictable: tightly constructed, easy-to-read spy thrillers that
blend historical figures and fictional characters.
   ``It's the story that identifies what I have to research,''
Forsyth said. ``I work out the story first, beginning middle and
end, chapter and verse _ right down to almost the smallest
details.''
   Originally a journalist, Forsyth chooses an international topic
of interest and carefully works out every plot twist, making sure
to establish a logical motivation for each of his characters.
   ``The Devil's Alternative,'' published in 1979, anticipated the
fall of the Shah of Iran and the rise of a female prime minister in
Great Britain. For his latest novel, ``The Negotiator'' ($19.95,
Bantam), Forsyth imagines the world shaken by a major energy
crisis. The idea came while Forsyth was lunching with a friend.
   ``He said there's a feasibility of our running out of oil,''
Forsyth said. ``The Saudis are going to own us. Out of 41 producer
nations, 31 are scheduled to run out within 20 years. Six of the 10
remaining are from the Middle East. That's power.
   ``I saw that Russia is due to run out in nine years. That
started my thought processes. What the hell are they going to do?
They're in more dire straights then we were.''
   The plot centers on the kidnapping of college student Simon
Cormack, the son of John Cormack, the president of the United
States who has agreed to a sweeping arms reduction deal with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Desperate U.S. officials turn to an embittered former hostage
negotiator, Quinn, to attain the young Cormack's release.
   In a book filled with presidents, prime ministers and
millionaire businessmen, Forsyth considered it essential to
structure the story around Quinn.
   ``It's difficult for the public to identify with a big
organization or a big government ministry,'' he said. ``We prefer
to empathize with one individual. The guy who stands up to the
establishment.
   ``The only way a man would have that capacity to act as a loner
would be that role. If he's for the FBI he's going to be on strings
to superior officers. If he's CIA, it's the same thing.''
   He used the same approach for his first book, ``The Day of the
Jackal,'' which came out in 1971.
   French President Charles de Gaulle had been under harsh
criticism in the early 1960s for favoring the independence of
Algeria, and several assassination attempts were made by the OAS
(Organisation de l'Armee Secrete).
   ``It just occurred to me that they weren't getting anywhere near
him because they were infiltrated,'' recalled Forsyth, a French
correspondent for Reuters at the time. ``French counterintelligence
got so many people in OAS they were being blown away.''
   He decided to write a book about a hired assassin's attempt,
code name ``The Jackal,'' to kill de Gaulle.
   ``I just dashed it off in a break between journalistic
assignments, thinking I might make a quick $1,000. Even my
publishers (Huntington; Viking), they decided they were going to
print 5,000 copies, thinking that was a very good print run.''
   The novel sold millions of copies, was translated into 11
languages and won the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe
Award. He was immediately comissioned to write two more books,
leaving behind his career in journalism.
   ``I thought it was like playing football,'' said Forsyth, who
followed up ``Jackal'' with ``The Odessa File'' and ``The Dogs of
War.''
   ``If the ball suddenly arrives in your hands, don't just stand
there staring at the stadium, run. You may crash, but go for it.''
