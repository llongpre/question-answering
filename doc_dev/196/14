   One of 12 known first editions of Edgar Allan
Poe's first published book sold at auction for $165,000, Sotheby's
said.
   The book, ``Tamerlane and Other Poems,'' went to a private
American collector, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman for the
auction house.
   The copy sold was one of two in private hands; the other sold at
Sotheby's last year for $198,000, Stewart said.
   Also Tuesday, a four-page autographed letter by Herman Melville
to Nathaniel Hawthorne's wife was bought for $132,000 by Profiles
in History, a Beverly Hills, Calif., dealer in books and
manuscripts, she said.
   In the Jan. 8, 1852, letter to Sophia Peabody Hawthorne, who had
complimented Melville on ``Moby Dick,'' the author denied that the
book contained any symbolism.
   Tuesday's sale of American literature and children's books from
the library of H. Bradley Martin totaled $2.6 million, Stewart said.
   Sale of the collection was to continue today with Americana,
including George Washington's copy of ``The Federalist Papers.''
