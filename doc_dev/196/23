   A man convicted of kidnapping and
murdering a businessman by burying him alive in a coffin-like box
``took the American dream ... and turned it into an Edgar Allan Poe
nightmare,'' the prosecutor says.
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Ficaro is seeking the death
penalty for Daniel J. Edwards, 31, of Bourbonnais, who was
convicted Monday.
   The jury deliberated about an hour before finding Edwards guilty
in the Sept. 2 abduction of Stephen Small, who suffocated while
buried in a rural section of Kankakee County in northeast Illinois
before his family could pay the $1 million ransom.
   Small, 40, was a great-grandson of former Gov. Len Small and a
member of a family with major media holdings. He was vice president
of Mid America Media, which owned radio and cable television
stations before its sale in 1986.
   Edwards showed no emotion when it was announced he had been
convicted of three counts of murder and 10 counts of aggravated
kidnapping.
   The jury will reconvene Wednesday to determine whether he should
be sentenced to death.
   In his closing argument in the week-long trial, Ficaro said
Edwards knew the Kankakee businessman wouldn't survive the burial.
``I never saw anybody come out of a grave,'' Ficaro said.
   ``Take a good long look,'' he told jurors as he pointed to the
homemade plywood crate in which Small died. ``Danny Edwards' greed
for the big score drove those nails, dug that grave and buried
Stephen Small alive.
   ``All Danny boy had to do to cash in on that jackpot was put
Stephen Small .. in a box,'' said Ficaro, slamming his hand on the
crate. ``He took the American dream ... and turned it into an Edgar
Allan Poe nightmare.''
   Edwards was ``a man who made greed his god,'' and planned for
Small to die so he could not tell police what had happened, said
Assistant Attorney General Frank Nowicki.
   Defense attorney Sheldon Reagan argued that a faulty air supply
system caused Small's death. He pointed out that Small was buried
with candy bars, lights, and water, and had not been harmed.
   ``It's an accident but it's not an intentional murder,'' said
Reagan, who sugggested someone else abducted Small.
   ``You don't make a box by accident,'' countered Ficaro.
``Stephen Small didn't wander by and fall in.''
   The prosecution argued that the candy bars, lights and water _
along with the plastic pipe the kidnapper claimed was for air _
were used to lure Small into the box.
   Small was lured from his Victorian home after midnight Sept. 2.
His wife, Nancy, received ransom calls throughout the day but could
not understand her husband's tape-recorded instructions for
delivering the cash.
   Two days later, police found Small's body buried under 3 feet of
sand about 13 miles southeast of Kankakee.
   ``Danny Edwards needed Stephen Small to make those tape
recordings and ... get in that box without a fight,'' said Nowicki.
   He said Small clawed, scratched and struggled to get out of the
box as he used up the limited air supply, but probably died within
hours.
   Edwards' live-in girlfriend, Nancy D. Rish, 26, awaits trial on
kidnapping and murder charges.
