   Disciples of fantasy-horror writer H.P.
Lovecraft are campaigning to mark the 100th anniversary of his
birth with a hometown monument to the man who inspired a generation
of spinners of creepy tales.
   The work of Lovecraft, an obscure pulp-magazine writer in his
lifetime, was rediscovered in the 1940s and he is mentioned in the
same breath as Edgar Allan Poe as the forerunner of today's
blockbuster authors of the macabre.
   ``Lovecraft probably influenced more writers stylistically
anywhere in America except Ernest Hemingway,'' said Robert Bloch,
author of the novel that inspired the movie ``Psycho,'' and one of
those who want Providence to put up a plaque honoring the hometown
author.
   ``I really think the city would be honoring itself, and
Lovecraft will take his place beside Poe,'' Bloch said.
   ``I think that Providence really has a debt to pay,'' said Jon
B. Cooke of Friends of H.P. Lovecraft, a group campaigning for a
memorial.
   City officials aren't eager to honor the writer, fearing they'd
set off a torrent of similar requests.
   The effort, however, gets a boost this weekend from the Horror
Writers of America, who are holding their annual meeting here to
mark the centennial of Lovecraft's birth.
   In a fitting tribute, the authors and screenwriters planned to
toast Lovecraft with champagne, at dusk, at his grave in Swan Point
Cemetery on Friday night.
   Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born in Providence on Aug. 20,
1890. He spent a brief period in New York, returning in his mid-30s
to live with two aunts until he died March 15, 1937, a victim of
Bright's disease and cancer.
   During his lifetime, he published just one book, ``The Shadow
over Innsmouth,'' in 1936. Most of his fantasy and horror tales
appeared in such pulp magazines as Weird Tales and Amazing Stories.
   Posthumously published collections of his stories inspired such
horror superstars as Stephen King and Clive Barker, and remain
popular among those who frequent the fantasy shelves in bookstores.
   Those books include ``The Outsider and Others,'' published in
1939; ``Beyond the Wall of Sleep,'' 1943; ``The Dunwich Horror,''
1945; ``The Case of Charles Dexter Ward,'' 1952. The product of
what some people called Lovecraft's ``sick'' mind was a world
dominated by sinister aliens, evil beings living in basements, and
beastlike creatures terrorizing helpless people.
   Bloch, in a telephone interview from his Los Angeles home, said
he never met Lovecraft in person, but was one of several aspiring
horror writers with whom the author corresponded.
   ``His encouragement to a teen-age kid in the middle of the Great
Depression was supremely responsible for my career,'' said Bloch,
73, who went on to write 54 books, 10 film scripts, a radio series
based on his stories, and about 70 television shows.
   Lovecraft's headstone is the city's only reminder that Lovecraft
hailed from Providence, other than his tales _ where he referred to
the city as the ``Divine Providence.''
   The horror writers and Friends of H.P. Lovecraft want the
memorial erected at Prospect Terrace, a park the author frequented,
and Cooke's group has raised more than enough money to pay for it.
   The city doesn't allow such markers, said Nancy Derrig,
superintendent of parks. She suggested the Lovecraft devotees take
their case to Brown University, where the writer's papers are
stored at the John Hay Library.
   Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. once proposed putting a plaque at
one of Lovecraft's homes, but nothing came of it.
   Brown has a Lovecraft symposium scheduled for mid-August.
   And fans want a Lovecraft-inspired movie, the upcoming
``Re-Animator II,'' to have its premiere in Providence.
   ``He's light on plot and character, but pretty strong on
atmosphere,'' Cooke said. ``He'll scare the hell out of you.''
