A Rancho Palos Verdes man who allegedly fired his gun into a carload of 
teen-agers on a scavenger hunt, injuring a 16-year-old boy, has been charged 
with assault with a deadly weapon and shooting into an inhabited vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Faulkner, 43, faces up to 13 years in prison, if he is convicted of the 
two felony charges filed Tuesday in South Bay Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred shortly after 10 p.m. May 28 when three Rolling Hills 
High School students drove to the home of varsity baseball coach Garry Poe to 
take Poe's license plate, a sheriff's investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
Poe said he aborted the prank when his daughter told him that someone was 
outside their house on Rockinghorse Road in Rancho Palos Verdes.

One Youth Wounded 
</P>
<P>
The youths, whose names were not released, sped off but drove into a dead end 
and had to turn around and drive back past Poe's home, according to the 
Sheriff's Department. Poe's neighbor, Faulkner, whose home had been burglarized 
recently, fired a shot at the car as it drove off, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The shot struck one of the youths in the arm, leaving a minor flesh wound. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, sheriff's deputies said the three 16-year-old 
students might be charged with trespassing, but the district attorney's office 
has declined to prosecute. The youths were not trespassing because Poe's car 
was parked in the street and their tampering with the license plate was so 
minor that it does not warrant filing criminal charges, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Martin Oghigian. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner, a contractor, could not be reached for comment.
