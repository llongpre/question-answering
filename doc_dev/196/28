   Those convicted of first-time drug possession in
Judge Ted Poe's court will get probation with a twist: their cars
must bear a bumper sticker reading ``Texas _ Don't Mess With
Drugs.''
   ``It's not going to move mountains, but it's just another way of
communicating that drugs are harmful,'' the state judge said Monday.
   Before instituting the policy, Poe's probation requirements
usually included regular urinalysis and drug treatment.
   The decals are a toned-down version of those many people
convicted of drunken driving must have on their cars warning
motorists that the driver is a felon and advising them to report
erratic driving to police.
   So far, the judge has given the stickers to six offenders. He
offers probation to first-time, non-violent offenders only, and not
to drug dealers.
   ``The only place (a dealer) is going to be able to put a bumper
sticker is on his tractor up at the penitentiary,'' Poe said.
   Poe is known for his creative probation requirements. Some
people placed on probation in his court worked on the restoration
of the battleship Texas, and a drunken driver had to erect a cross
where he killed the victim.
   ``The old paths are not the proven paths,'' Poe said of his
unorthodox ways.
