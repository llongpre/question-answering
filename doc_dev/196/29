Los Angeles designer Gregory Poe, who makes and peddles his pricey clothes in 
Japan, is setting the stage for his entry into the U.S. market -- literally. 
Poe, 32, designed the flashy costumes for "The Geography of Luck," a play 
opening today at the downtown Los Angeles Theatre Center. Set in Las Vegas, 
Poe's most spectacular female get-up is a Kelly green showgirl number, complete 
with satin, feathers, sequins and beaded headdress. Poe, who says he plans 
later this year to start selling his other designs in the United States, 
describes the "Geography" costume gamut as "anywhere from very glitzy showgirls 
to white trash."

The Unusual Is His Usual

Stylist to the stars Angelo di Biase has left his post at Umberto to become the 
style director at Char Salon. Di Biase is known for creating the unusual hair 
styles sported by Rosanna Arquette, Beverly D'Angelo and Ellen Barkin. His work 
will be seen in the movie "Johnny Handsome," featuring Barkin and Mickey 
Rourke. Di Biase will also be responsible for coiffures showcased in "Robocop 
II." Guess even robots need the right "do."

Step Right Up, Folks

Here's a new approach to hair salon protocol. At the Accent salon, clients are 
taken on a walk-in basis only. No appointments accepted. And those who wait 
more than 45 minutes for services are granted a 50% discount. There are seven 
of these shops in U.S. cities now, and there will be one in Los Angeles this 
year, says Mary Tingle, a spokeswoman for the company. They cater especially to 
the hair-care needs of black men and women, and use both Gentille and Nucleic A 
products, she tells Listen.

Try to Patch That Up

Looks like Tom Petty is into the hippie scene, judging from the decorative 
patches on his blue jeans. Listen caught sight of him the other night, with 
rocker Billy Idol close by. Idol isn't joining the Woodstock Revisited look, 
despite all the hoopla lately about this being the 20th year after. He's still 
wearing his ubiquitous black leather with fringe. This time he added a 
horsehide vest, complete with Pinto markings. What would the hippie vegetarians 
say about that?
