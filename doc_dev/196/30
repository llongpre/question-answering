<HEAD>Poet Mark Strand Gets Laureate's Post at Library of Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poet Mark Strand, an English professor at the
University of Utah, was named Friday as the new poet laureate
consultant in poetry at the Library of Congress.
   Strand, who also is a short-story writer, editor, translator and
author of children's books, will start his one-year assignment in
September.
   He will receive $35,000 to give a poetry reading and a lecture
during the year, to work with students and to advise Librarian of
Congress James H. Billington on new library acquisitions.
   He will succeed poet Howard Nemerov, who served for two years.
   The position of consultant in poetry was created 54 years ago,
but Congress voted in 1985 to expand the title to designate its
holder as the equivalent of poet laureate of the United States.
   Since then, four poets have been named as poet laureate
consultant in poetry at the libary. Besides Strand and Nemerov,
they were the late Robert Penn Warren and Richard Wilbur.
   Strand has published seven collections of poetry. His eighth,
``The Continuous Life,'' is to be released in October. He also has
translated works by other poets, written three children's books and
two books on art, and has published three anthologies.
   A former Fulbright Scholar, Strand taught at 14 colleges and
universities, including Harvard, Yale and Princeton, before he
joined the University of Utah faculty in Salt Lake City in 1981.
Among his awards are the Edgar Allan Poe prize in 1974 and the
National Institute of Arts and Letters award in 1975.
