   Sticks, stones, tanks and helicopters can't hurt
Rambo, but critical words are sharper than death for Sylvester
Stallone.
   ``Oh yeah, it hurts,'' says Stallone, and he remembers some that
stung.
   ``Like, `this is a guy who should now consider going to
Louisiana and become a bayou fisherman.' That's a little rough. Or
when someone will say, `his career is stranger than crib death.'''
   It hurts so much he laughs.
   ``In one way it is very humorous. But if I said these things to
a child ... the kid would be in an institution by the time he was
12. He would have no ego. He'd be gone,'' said Stallone, who was
grinding through a full day of interviews to promote the $63
million ``Rambo III.''
   ``I've seen a lot of actors, they get on a bad roll and they
keep descending and the critics keep pounding on them. And maybe
rightly so, but too harshly. I mean, lighten up a little bit or
you'll kill that character.''
   ``Rambo III'' follows the failure of ``Over the Top,'' in which
Stallone played a trucker who wins his son's affection, in part,
through arm-wrestling. ``In `Over the Top,' I just felt that the
movie was what it was, a simple little movie,'' he said. ``It was
sold, I think, improperly because people perceived it as this big
action epic, and it wasn't.''
   Stallone, 41, was all but unknown when ``Rocky'' burst on the
screen in 1976. Made for $1.1 million, ``Rocky'' took in more than
$45 million at the box office, won an Academy Award for best
picture, and received best-actor and best-screenplay nominations
for Stallone.
   Later films have made more money, but none has enjoyed that kind
of critical success.
   ``Rambo III'' figures to be critic-proof, returning to the
violence-laden formula that carried ``Rambo II'' to a worldwide box
office of $270 million.
   ``People say, `yeah, you're giggling all the way to the bank,'''
said Stallone, who picked up nearly $20 million for reprising his
role.
   ``No! No! The money is a result of the success of the film, but
if you are perceived as a failure in the eyes of your peers _ you
see what I mean? _ you have a problem.
   ``It reminds me of the character in `East of Eden,' Jett Rink _
remember that? _ when he has a banquet and no one shows up? He's a
billionaire, and he stands there all alone, and he collapses on the
table. Seating for a thousand, and he's all alone.''
   Stallone, though, expects to keep going for a while, and he
joked about a sequel way down the line: ``We find out that Rambo
had a brother, and it's Rocky Balboa. And they meet, and we do like
a Hayley Mills split screen,'' he said.
   ``We could keep this baby going on forever. I know we're
reaching, it's getting kind of thin on plot, but let's go for it.''
   Stallone has gotten this far on the script:
   ``Why don't you cut your hair, brother?''
   ``Noooooo.''
   Meanwhile, he's scouting ideas for ``Rambo IV,'' and getting
ready for ``Rocky V'' and even talking about ``Cobra II.''
   When it comes to his characters, Stallone is no killer.
   ``It's hard. Not if I like them, no, I really can't,'' he said.
   ``Because I think people die a hundred times over when you keep
them alive. When their honor is gone, and they've been shamed
publicly, or their manhood has been impugned irreparably _ whew!
Death is easy. Living is hard.''
   In terms of critical acceptance, Stallone thinks maybe he should
have followed David Morrell's book, ``First Blood,'' and killed
Rambo in the first film. It was shot that way at first, but wasn't
palatable to test audiences or to the star.
   ``He was a psycho in the book, and being true to that character,
he wiped out everyone,'' Stallone said.
   ``And I think it would have been a great movie on that level
too, but it would have been a harsh expose. I think it would have
received more accolades, that this was an important film like
`Platoon' or `Coming Home' if we had stayed with it, because that
really would have been an indictment.''
   Stallone has talked about playing a Hasidic cowboy, or doing a
film on religion. One project he's given up is starring as Edgar
Allen Poe in a screenplay he wrote years ago.
   Audiences just wouldn't buy it, he said.
   ``I'd be saying, `Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered
weak and weary,' and you know someone would say, `Remember when he
used to carry a gun?' The image of the long hair and headband would
like _ woooooaaaaah! _ be superimposed.
   ``What's he gonna say? `Yo! Quoth the raven! Yo! Poe!'''
