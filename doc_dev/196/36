SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED FOR FIRING AT TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Rancho Palos Verdes man has been placed on three years' probation after 
pleading no contest to a charge of firing a handgun into a carload of 
teen-agers on a scavenger hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Superior Court Judge John Shook also ordered Carl Faulkner, a 
44-year-contractor, to pay a $500 fine and to turn over his gun to authorities 
to be destroyed, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Geltz. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner was charged with shooting into an occupied vehicle last June after he 
allegedly fired one shot into a car carrying three Rolling Hills High School 
students, slightly injuring a 16-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
The May 28 shooting occurred after the students had gone to the home of the 
school's varsity baseball coach, Gary Poe, to take Poe's license plate as a 
prank. 
</P>
<P>
Poe, alerted by his daughter that someone was outside their house, aborted the 
prank, sheriff's investigators said. As the youths sped off, Faulkner, a 
neighbor of Poe's, fired a shot at the vehicle, investigators said. Faulkner's 
home had recently been burglarized. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Faulkner pleaded no contest to a felony charge, Shook reduced it to 
a misdemeanor, which carries less severe probation violation penalties, Geltz 
said.
