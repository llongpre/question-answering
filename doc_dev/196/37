Hal G. Evarts Jr., a 49-year resident of La Jolla whose literary career spanned 
more than 50 years and included stints as a free-lance writer, journalist and 
novelist, died Sunday after a fall at home. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas native collected two Edgar Allan Poe Awards from the Mystery Writers 
of America for his novels "Treasure River" in 1964 and "Smugglers' Road" in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, he started writing adventure and mystery stories for young 
readers, including the popular "Big Foot." 
</P>
<P>
The American West was the theme of many of Evarts' earlier novels, including 
"Colorado Crossing," "Man Without a Gun" and "The Sundown Kid." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1936 from Stanford University, where he earned a bachelor's 
degree in English, Evarts traveled around the world. He incorporated his 
experiences in such remote areas as Tibet and western China into magazine 
articles, short stories and novels. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote 28 novels and more than 100 short stories. 
</P>
<P>
Evarts' writing career began in 1935 as a reporter with the San Diego Evening 
Tribune. In 1939, he signed on with the European edition of the New York Herald 
Tribune in Paris. After only a few months as a foreign correspondent, he was 
out of a job when the impending German occupation forced the office to suspend 
operations in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Europe in 1945 as a combat historian before settling in La Jolla 
the same year and resuming his career as a free-lance writer. 
</P>
<P>
Evarts is survived by his wife, Dorothea Abbot Evarts; a daughter, Ginger 
Wadsworth of Orinda; sons John of Santa Ynez and Bill of San Diego and five 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The family requests that friends remember him with gifts to the Anza-Borrego 
Desert Natural History Assn., Hal G. Evarts Memorial Library Fund, P.O. Box 
311, Borrego Springs, CA 92004.
