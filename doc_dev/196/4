   A mysterious man dressed in black left a half
bottle of cognac and three roses on Edgar Allan Poe's grave early
today in a ritual that for 41 years has marked the horror writer's
birthday.
   ``Tonight at 3 a.m., six of us inside Westminster Hall spotted a
man dressed in black with a white scarf walk into the grave yard
and place the cognac and roses on the grave,'' said Jeff Jerome,
curator of the Edgar Allan Poe House. ``Some saw a man with white
hair and others didn't.''
   The gifts first were left on Poe's grave at Westminster Hall in
1949, the 100th anniversary of his death, said Jerome, 40.
   There is some argument as to whether the same man has been
responsible for leaving the gift for the entire 41 years, or
whether there has been a succession of grave decorators. Stopping
the man to find out would be out of the question, Jerome said.
   ``First of all, that would be an invasion of privacy,'' he said.
``It's none of our business .. if we interfered, it would ruin it.''
   The man in black leaves a rose for each grave; the bodies of
Poe's wife, Virginia, who died at 25 of tuberculosis, and his aunt,
Maria Poe Clemm, are buried beside the writer.
   Among Poe's most well-known stories are ``The Pit and the
Pendulum,'' and ``The Fall of the House of Usher,'' as well as the
poem ``The Raven.''
