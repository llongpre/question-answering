   A citrus industry committee on Friday
asked state and federal authorities to impose a quarantine and
fruit shipping restrictions around a grove infested with a virulent
strain of citrus canker.
   The quarantine would establish a strict inspection and
eradication program and restrict marketing of fruit from the grove
owned by Florida Citrus Commissioner Ed Smoak.
   Canker is a bacterial disease that could spread and devastate
Florida's billion-dollar citrus industry, scientists say.
   Steve Poe, a scientist representing the U.S. Department of
Agriculture on the committee investigating the canker infestation,
said the agency may impose a quarantine within the next two weeks.
   But the U.S. Department of Agriculture won't rush because the
400-acre grove is isolated and not productive, so the disease is
unlikey to spread to Florida's 700,000 acres of commercial groves.
   ``That's one reason we're taking our time on this,'' Poe said.
``It's really pretty sparsely inhabited and only a total of about
55 acres are in production in there.''
   The Asiatic or A-strain of the disease blemishes and blisters
tree stems, leaves and fruit.
   Other citrus-producing states like Texas, California and Arizona
rely on federal shipping embargoes and quarantines to keep the
disease from spreading into their groves.
   The outbreak has tentatively been traced to another small
infestation discovered elsewhere in Florida in 1986.
   State agriculture officials believe a former employee of the
canker-eradication program took infected material to his home near
the Smoak grove.
   Leon Hebb, acting director of the state's canker eradication
program, said the man may have taken the infected material for
private research.
   Poe said the USDA was working with state investigators to
determine if the man caused the infestation.
   ``It's a real detective story,'' Poe said. ``We're doing
everything to trace the whole thing down.''
