   A jury Wednesday ordered 10 years'
probation and a $5,000 fine for a man whose lion mauled a girl at a
flea market, and a judge barred him from contact with exotic
animals and children.
   State District Judge Ted Poe said in augmenting the jury's
sentence that it was Gary Durkovitz's fault that Roxanne Hernandez
``is going to bear the bite of a lion for the rest of her life.''
   ``Society needs to realize that certain creatures don't belong
near the city, near the public where they can hurt little girls.
... I wanted to make sure he never forgot that,'' Poe said.
   Durkovitz, 35, whose 350-pound pet lion, Samson, attacked the
8-year-old girl at a flea market in Houston on Oct. 10, was
convicted last week of injury to a child.
   The lion tried to put the girl's head in its mouth and bit off
part of her skull, exposing part of the brain. The girl has
undergone reconstructive surgery and faces more operations.
   After the jury ordered the probation and fine, Poe imposed
further restrictions, ordering Durkovitz to get rid of all his
exotic animals, to stay away from children and to serve 30 days in
Harris County Jail.
   Since the attack, Durkovitz has been jailed on two charges of
indecency with a child and one of aggravated sexual assault of a
child. The cases, which are pending, stem from his allegedly using
the lion and other exotic animals to attract boys, prosecutors said.
   Poe also ordered Durkovitz to do 20 hours of community service
work each month with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals and said he would have to approve any of Durkovitz's future
jobs.
   Defense attorney Robert Scardino said he would appeal the
verdict.
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Alice Brown, who had
asked for the maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $5,000
fine, said she was not disappointed about the sentence.
   Durkovitz was walking the lion out of the flea market on a chain
leash when it attacked Roxanne as she walked in front of it.
   The girl's mother, Sonia Hernandez, testified the girl had to
wear a wig or cap in public and had trouble concentrating.
   The lion was shot as it was attacking the girl and was destroyed
later.
   Durkovitz, who testified he had taken every measure to prevent
an attack, also faces a civil lawsuit in the case.
