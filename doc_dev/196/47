   Poet Mark Strand, an English professor at the
University of Utah, has been named the new poet laureate consultant
in poetry at the Library of Congress.
   Strand will start his one-year assignment in September.
   He will receive $35,000 to give a poetry reading and a lecture
during the year, to work with students and to advise Librarian of
Congress James H. Billington on new library acquisitions.
   He will succeed poet Howard Nemerov, who served for two years.

as the equivalent of poet laureate of the United States.
   A former Fulbright Scholar, Strand taught at 14 colleges and
universities before he joined the University of Utah faculty in
Salt Lake City in 1981. Among his awards are the Edgar Allan Poe
prize in 1974 and the National Institute of Arts and Letters award

<HEAD>Lawyer Who Ditched Plane Over Atlantic Faces FCC Disbarment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington attorney who ditched his plane
in the Atlantic Ocean last summer has been ordered to show why he
shouldn't be disbarred from practicing before the Federal
Communications Commission.
   In the meantime, Thomas L. Root has been suspended from
practicing law before the commission, the FCC said Friday.
   The commission said it took the action because the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia entered an order April 12
disbarring Root by consent. FCC rules require that attorneys
practicing before it not be under any disbarment order.
   Telephone calls to Root's office Friday went unanswered.
   In March, Root was indicted on 33 counts of fraud and other
crimes involving radio stations he was representing before the FCC.
   The federal indictment accused Root of defrauding the government
and five clients in FCC proceedings on permits to construct FM
radio stations throughout the United States.
   Root gained notoriety last July when his single-engine plane ran
out of fuel and plunged into the Atlantic off the Bahamas following
a six-hour, 800-mile flight that began near Washington.
   He told authorities that he had been unconscious for most of the
odyssey, but Navy fighter pilots flying alongside the plane
reported seeing him move in the cockpit.
   When he was taken to a Florida hospital, Root was found to have
suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
   Less than a week after the crash, Sonrise Management Services of
Columbus, Ga., sued Root for $584,000, claiming he failed to
perform work and double-billed a client.
   Root filed for bankruptcy court protection from creditors in
October 1989, claiming he had $1.64 million in liabilities.
