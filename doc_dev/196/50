Passover gets the performance treatment at Highways in Santa Monica on April 
10, when the traditional Seder will be celebrated with a mix of old and new 
ritual: readings from the Haggada both ancient and feminist, Middle 
East-inspired food, performance and music -- on the flute, guitar and 
saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
(The Seder is a religious meal accompanied by the retelling of the Jews' escape 
from Egypt; the Haggada is the biblical narrative.) "Not all of us are Jewish," 
said Robin Podolsky, one of the seven people who assembled the evening. "And 
within those of us who are Jewish, there's a real range. For instance, I'm 
quite secular; my spiritual practice is as eclectic as you can get. Malcolm 
Boyd knows more about liturgy than anyone. And Brian Zeiden is a student of 
religion -- and quite observant." 
</P>
<P>
The unifying intent, she added, "was to consciously re-create the link between 
theater and ritual. For a lot of us, there's a memory and affinity for the 
ritual of Seder -- sitting around the table as a child -- and wanting to say, 
'This is what we do in our lives: tell stories to make sense of the world.' As 
critical thinkers, we try to take those stories apart. As actors we try to put 
the magic back, albeit informed with understanding." 
</P>
<P>
The seven, who for the most part are either gay, lesbian or people with AIDS, 
have also sought to include the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 
inviting a dozen Middle Eastern artists to participate. "The story of the Seder 
is the narrative thread that pulls the evening together," Podolsky said. 
Participants are asked to provide an offering: a music performance or symbolic 
reading, food (only unleavened bread will do) or goods such as candles and 
incense. Admission is $5.
