In another Bay League game: 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes 11, Rolling Hills 4 -- Pat O'Hara and Jason Goldberg each drove in 
four runs and the Sea Kings roughed up Rolling Hills' ace Kirt Kishita for five 
runs at Palos Verdes to finish in fourth place in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (15-11, 8-6) snapped a 2-2 tie with five runs in the fifth. Four 
of the runs came off Kishita, who relieved starter Tristan Paul with no outs 
and a runner on first. 
</P>
<P>
Kishita, who allowed another run in the sixth before being pulled, was pitching 
on a day's rest after hurling a three-hitter Tuesday in Rolling Hills' 
playoff-clinching 8-2 victory over Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"Was he ready when I brought him in?" Coach Garry Poe said. "I don't know. The 
problem with Kirt is he always wants the ball. He's so enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
But Poe said it was obvious that the junior right-hander didn't have his best 
stuff. Kishita gave up six hits and two walks, one with the bases loaded, in 
his inning of work. 
</P>
<P>
"We teed off on him, didn't we?" said Palos Verdes Coach Gil Eberhard. "I don't 
know why we didn't hit the ball the other day." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg highlighted the Sea Kings' five-run fifth with a two-run double down 
the first-base line. They added four runs in the sixth, capped by a towering 
three-run homer to right-center field by O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
A junior left-hander, O'Hara pitched 6 2/3 innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes managed to remain in playoff contention until the final day of the 
season despite the loss of two starters. Second baseman Chuck Okada, the team's 
leading hitter, was sidelined with a knee injury April 5 and Steve Hoye, the 
top pitcher and shortstop, was suspended from the team last week because of a 
school violation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Poe: "They did a great job to hang in the way they did. They faced a lot 
of adversity."ROB FERNAS
