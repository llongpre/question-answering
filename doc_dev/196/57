There was never a more aptly named autobiography than "How I Made a Hundred 
Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime," written by the film maker who's 
been called the King of the B Movies and the Pope of Pop Cinema. Roger Corman 
can boast -- and does, on his first page -- that his operation is on an 
unbelievable streak: 60 consecutive profitable movies. 
</P>
<P>
Corman has made a success in every aspect of the business, from producing and 
directing such works as "The Little Shop of Horrors," his Edgar Allan Poe films 
("The Fall of the House of Usher" and "The Pit and the Pendulum," among others) 
and his biker films (made with the real Hell's Angels) to distributing his own 
films and others'. 
</P>
<P>
"I am known for making films cheaply, quickly, profitably," Corman writes 
succinctly, "and for finding innovative, unconventional ways of putting up on 
the screen an intangible 'production value' worth several times my films' 
actual cost." Although his hallmark is economy, he reminds readers that "my 
better films have been shown at prestigious festivals. . . . Moreover, at New 
World, while we churned out R-rated exploitation fare through the 1970s, I also 
found new and quite lucrative ways to import world-class art films from abroad, 
four of which won Best Foreign Film Oscars." (The legendary producer/director 
and self-confessed "outlaw" film maker is still at it: His biggest-budget film 
ever, "Roger Corman's Frankenstein," is due for release over the Memorial Day 
weekend.) 
</P>
<P>
Corman's boasts, however -- and much he has to boast about -- begin and end in 
Chapter 1. The rest of the book (written with journalist Jim Jerome, co-author 
of "Papa John") is devoted to storytelling -- by Corman, about Corman, at 
Corman's expense, at everyone else's expense, but always to the greater glory 
of the art he practices so exuberantly. The overriding sense one gets from the 
torrent of stories told here is that film is treated too often with kid gloves, 
and that the success of Corman productions comes from never fearing to jump in 
and get dirty. 
</P>
<P>
Corman's own narrative is intercut with stories told by people who worked with 
him. Some of the best stories chronicle the early efforts of the host of famous 
film people who got their start under Corman's tutelage: Martin Scorsese, 
Jonathan Demme, Ron Howard, John Sayles, Jack Nicholson and many others. 
</P>
<P>
Here are riotous tales of feature-length films shot in a few days on shoestring 
budgets. "Hollywood Boulevard" was made when Jon Davison bet Corman that he 
could produce a picture for $50,000 less than anything Corman's company had 
done. The film used stock footage from the studio, and young trailer-cutters 
Joe Dante and Allan Arkush got their first chance at directing. Abby Dalton 
recalls another mad production in which "Roger, on his way to setting his 
record, set up shots so quickly that one of the Viking girls in the background 
raced through a shot with her sunglasses on. No one even noticed." When Martin 
Scorsese first met Corman, he expected to meet the maniacal, seat-of-the-pants 
yahoo type that the stories might suggest. "Instead," Scorsese recalls, "I 
found him a very courteous and gentlemanly guy, but a very stern and tough 
customer who was quite polite as he explained these outrageous tactics of 
exploitation in cold, calm terms. . . . 'Martin, (Corman told him,) it's 
important that every fifteen pages there should be a touch of nudity or the 
suggestion thereof. Like a shoulder or leg exposed. It keeps the interest.' " 
</P>
<P>
Corman's autobiography employs the same successful technique as his films: It's 
fast-paced, not overly intricate, and it tells a great story.
