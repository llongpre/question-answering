A state report predicts that the proposed city of Sunset Hills would face 
budget deficits immediately after incorporation, but a key cityhood supporter 
said the study is still encouraging news to residents hoping to create another 
new city in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released Tuesday, said Sunset Hills, located west of the city of 
Santa Clarita, would accrue yearly budget deficits ranging from $275,000 to 
nearly $500,000 during the first four years of cityhood. But those deficits 
would be relatively minor compared to projected deficits for other new cities 
such as Santa Clarita, Ernest Dynda, a cityhood proponent, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared by the Local Agency Formation Commission, or LAFCO, 
which oversees annexations and incorporations. 
</P>
<P>
Dynda had not read the complete report but said the small size of projected 
deficits could bode well for Sunset Hills. "It sounds good," he said. But he 
added that the report raises more questions than it answers. 
</P>
<P>
The only certainty Wednesday was that the city of Santa Clarita will oppose 
incorporation because it hopes to annex the area. Mayor Jo Anne Darcy pledged 
to fight the Sunset Hills cityhood effort. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset Hills would cover 27.8 square miles west of the Golden State Freeway and 
south of California 126, including Six Flags Magic Mountain and the Stevenson 
Ranch development under construction by the Dale Poe Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
The area has an estimated 1,701 residents and could have 2,264 by 1993, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, and Dynda, a former Poe consultant 
and Agoura Hills city councilman, are leading the cityhood drive. Some critics 
have derisively dubbed the area "Poe-dunk." 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said projected deficits for Sunset Hills seemed unusually low. "I thought 
it would be in the millions," Darcy said. 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Clarita incorporated two years ago, for example, LAFCO projected 
that the first-year deficit would be $3.5 million, Darcy said. LAFCO approved 
letting residents vote on Santa Clarita incorporation despite the projected 
deficit. As it turned out, the city had a $2.5-million surplus in its first 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal report released Tuesday does not endorse or oppose cityhood for 
Sunset Hills. Instead, it outlines the potential revenues and expenses of the 
proposed city. The commission is scheduled to hold a hearing on the cityhood 
proposal June 27. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO officials were out of town at a conference Wednesday and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita asked LAFCO last year to include the Sunset Hills area in its 
"sphere of influence," thus making the area eligible for annexation to the 
city. LAFCO turned down the request, citing the incorporation effort launched 
by Dynda and Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed city would include Six Flags Magic Mountain and property owned by 
Newhall Land and Farming Co. but both companies have said they do not want to 
be included in Sunset Hills.
