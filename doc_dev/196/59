HAS AGREED TO DROP ITS OPPOSITION TO THE DEVELOPER'S PLAN TO CONSTRUCT AT LEAST 
10,000 UNITS.

A major developer has agreed to donate land and cash to a Santa Clarita Valley 
high school district worth as much as $29.3 million -- the largest such 
contribution ever made to the school system. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the William S. Hart Union High School District has agreed not to 
oppose plans by the developer, Dale Poe Development Corp., to build at least 
10,000 units in the company's giant Stevenson Ranch residential project west of 
the Golden State Freeway and south of Six Flags Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Hart officials had previously urged the Los Angeles County Planning Commission 
and the Board of Supervisors to reject the project because it could eventually 
add 2,500 students to the rapidly growing school district. 
</P>
<P>
The donations are worth almost twice as much as the standard developer fees 
levied on residential construction to build schools, Hart Supt. Clyde Smyth 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, developers must pay local school districts $1.56 for each 
square foot of residential construction. Those fees would have netted the Hart 
district only $15 million, Smyth said. 
</P>
<P>
Smyth and school officials statewide have said for years that developer fees do 
not provide enough funds to build new schools. Hart officials have repeatedly 
said they would drop their opposition to Stevenson Ranch only if the company 
scaled down its plans or went beyond the payments required by law. 
</P>
<P>
The Hart trustees approved the agreement Thursday night. Under it, the district 
will not endorse Stevenson Ranch but will withdraw its opposition and send a 
letter to the Board of Supervisors listing the benefits of the pact to the 
Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair," Smyth said. Asked if the pact would set a precedent for 
other school districts to follow, he replied, "I would sure be happy if it 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, said the company was pleased with 
the package and noted that it follows a similar deal -- worth $22 million -- 
that the company struck with the Newhall School District, an elementary school 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The donations to Hart are tied to the number of units eventually built in 
Stevenson Ranch. Dale Poe is obligated to donate 42 acres, still to be 
selected, for a new high school to serve residents of the more than 5,000 units 
the company has already received county permission to build, Smyth said. The 
land is worth $16.8 million, and the company will donate $1.8 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The company would donate 24.5 acres, worth $9.7 million, for a junior high 
school if the company wins approval of another 2,500 units, Smyth said. If 
Stevenson Ranch eventually reaches 10,000 units, the company would donate 
another $1 million in cash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement comes at an important time for Dale Poe. Last month the Los 
Angeles Regional Planning Commission refused to revise the area's General Plan 
to allow Stevenson Ranch to expand to at least 10,000 units. Dale Poe intends 
to press for the expansion when the plan reaches the Board of Supervisors, 
which will make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
After the commission's action, Stevenson said the company would try to persuade 
the supervisors to allow the expansion by citing the project's amenities and 
its value to the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Valley's five school districts are scrambling to accommodate 
skyrocketing enrollments. District superintendents predict that they will need 
to build 33 schools by 2010 -- at a cost of $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hart officials hope to hear sometime this summer whether the district has 
qualified for state funding to build a new high school -- the district's fourth 
-- in Valencia. It will cost about $40 million to purchase the land and build 
the school, Smyth said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district, now with 9,400 students, will have 11,569 in two years, 
about 3,300 over the enrollment its schools are designed to hold. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth high school is tentatively planned for the eastern side of the Santa 
Clarita Valley. The Stevenson Ranch site would be the district's sixth high 
school campus.
