   Jesse Jackson said Monday he expects Democratic
leaders to embrace him as the nominee if he wins the most
pre-convention delegates because ``I would have earned it from the
people.'' Democrat Richard Gephardt ended his candidacy, and
Republican ex-candidate Jack Kemp climbed on George Bush's
bandwagon.
   As Democratic leaders wrestled with the implications of
Jackson's overwhelming weekend victory in Michigan, Gephardt left
the race for the Democratic presidential nomination at a Capitol
Hill news conference.
   ``It's been said the opera isn't over until the fat lady
sings,'' Gephardt said. ``Last Saturday in Michigian I think I
heard her walking to the microphone.''

   Richard Gephardt quit the Democratic
presidential race Monday, saying ``we lost, no question about
that,'' but declaring his party can win the White House in the fall
only by picking up his populist economic themes.
   Gephardt, whose campaign faltered after his initial win in
Iowa's caucuses on Feb. 8, said he would file for re-election to
his House seat from Missouri.
   ``I believe that our effort was not in vain _ that we challenged
the Democratic Party and called it back to its central role as an
agent of fundamental change,'' Gephardt said at an emotional
Capitol Hill news conference packed with journalists and
supporters, including many of his House colleagues.

   Democratic leaders said Monday they oppose any
``Stop Jesse Jackson'' movement in the wake of his stunning
Michigan caucus victory even as the outline of such an effort took
shape in the South.
   ``The party can't afford that,'' said Jim Ruvolo, state chairman
in Ohio. ``Jesse Jackson is not where he is by some sleight of
hand. He got there by winning votes.''
   Jackson overwhelmed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the
Michigan caucuses on Saturday, winning the industrial state by
nearly 2-to-1. That victory stalled Dukakis' momentum and boosted
talk that Jackson could be the first black to win the party's
presidential nomination.

   Howard H. Baker Jr. says he won't be asked.
California Gov. George Deukmejian says he wouldn't be able to
accept. George Bush says it's too early to think about it.
   Still, a lot of people do.
   As the vice president's grip on the Republican presidential
nomination tightens, the question arises: Who will be his running
mate?

   Police and soldiers using shotguns,
rubber truncheons and tear gas broke up a march Monday by thousands
of opponents of Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Meanwhile, a general strike that has closed down an estimated 90
percent of Panama's industry and commerce entered its second week.
   Ignoring an order to disperse, a crowd of more than 10,000
cheering people began walking toward the capital's central business
district Monday afternoon.

   House Democratic and Republican leaders sought
agreement Monday on a package of strictly ``humanitarian'' aid to
Nicaragua's Contras to sustain the rebels while they work out a
peace accord with the leftist Sandinista government.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said he expected quick
agreement on an aid package that will conform to the requirements
of a truce reached last week between the rebels and the Managua
government.
   ``For this (peace) effort to work, there's got to be this aid,''
said Adolfo Calero, a leader of the rebel political directorate,
who met with Wright and other congressional leaders on the aid
package.

   The first American troops to return from
a training mission in Honduras to counter a Nicaraguan advance
earlier this month parachuted into their home base Monday amid
cheers of relatives and friends.
   An estimated 800 soldiers dropped into the Sicily Drop Zone at
Fort Bragg, home of the 82nd Airborne Division, about 5 p.m. They
were met by a military band and commanding generals from the base.
   Earlier in the day, the troops from the 82nd Airborne whistled
as they boarded seven C-141 transports for the United States.

   Israel has handed over classified documents to
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh for his Iran-Contra
investigation under a cooperation agreement reached after year-long
negotiations, an Israeli official said Monday.
   In return, Walsh apparently agreed to revoke the subpoenas he
issued to four Israelis who arranged the 1985 and 1986 shipment of
U.S.-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Iran, the
official and a U.S. lawyer indicated.
   ``He will get what he wants without us having to give up what we
wanted,'' said the Israeli official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

   Supporters of slain Indian activist Julian
Pierce said Monday they would seek to change state law that would
automatically make his judicial primary opponent the winner of the
election.
   Backers of Pierce, a lawyer who was shot to death over the
weekend at his rural home in what authorities called an
assassination, decided to seek a special legislative session to
allow a substitute candidate in the May 3 primary for Superior
Court judge in racially divided Robeson County.
   State law says if a candidate dies 30 days or more after the
filing period closes in that election, the opposing candidate is
declared the winner.

   An angry Gov. Evan Mecham complained from
the stand at his impeachment trial Monday that he was ``insulted''
by a prosecutor's comparing his actions to embezzlement.
   ``I have to make a statement,'' Mecham declared, ignoring orders
from Arizona Supreme Court Justice Frank Gordon to refrain from
comments beyond answering questions asked.
   ``I resent so highly the word embezzlement in my presence,''
Mecham said. ``I'm insulted by it.''

   President Reagan said Monday the American
public won't accept trade restrictions and retaliation against
foreign manufacturers.
   Reagan, promoting his free-trade stance even in the face of
mounting U.S. trade imbalances, warned that a trade bill under
consideration in Congress could weaken international trading
systems and ``require the president to start trade wars.''
   ``I'll veto if I must,'' Reagan told Reynolds Metals Co. workers
on the eve of a crucial House-Senate conference committee meeting
on the bill.

   A rare first edition of Edgar Allan Poe's first
book, a collection of poetry written when he was 14, is to be
auctioned by Sotheby's, which calls it ``the most exciting book
discovery in many years.''
   In the 161 years since its publication, only 11 other copies of
``Tamerlane and Other Poems'' have been found. Published in 1827 by
an obscure Boston printer when the poet, short story writer and
critic was 18, it could bring as much as $300,000 at auction on
June 7.
   This 12th copy of the book was discovered in a bin of early
20th-century pamphlets on fertilizers and farming machines by a
Massachusetts book collector while he browsed at an antique barn in
New Hampshire. The price was $15.

   On Feb. 15, 1986, the Amsterdam News printed a
front-page editorial calling upon Mayor Edward I. Koch to resign.
   Koch ignored it.
   He also ignored the next week's editorial, and the one after
that. He has now ignored 110 consecutive editorials on the front
page of New York's oldest black newspaper, each broadside demanding
that he leave office.
