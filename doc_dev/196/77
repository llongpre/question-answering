   The stories of the late Flannery O'Connor are
best understood by what's left unsaid.
   ``She said that it was the mystery, what cannot be explained,
that made a story endlessly fascinating. She didn't feel that God's
ways were cut and dry. There were always some surprises in store
for everybody,'' said Sally Fitzgerald, a longtime friend of the
late writer who has edited O'Connor's ``Collected Works'' (Library
of America, $30)
   The anthology contains the Georgia native's novels, ``Wise
Blood'' and ``The Violent Bear It Away,'' as well as such short
stories as ``The Artificial Nigger'' and ``A Good Man Is Hard to
Find.'' Also included are essays and a large selection of letters.
   Mary Flannery O'Connor was born in Savannah in 1925, the only
child of Regina Cline and Edward Francis O'Connor, Jr.
   She began writing at an early age and set up an attic studio in
her home as a work place. One of her favorite books growing up was
``The Humorous Tales of Edgar Allan Poe.''
   She contributed cartoons and articles to her high school
newspaper and entered Georgia State College for Women in 1942.
While in college, she began signing her academic work ``Flannery
O'Connor.''
   In 1945, she received a scholarship in journalism from the
University of Iowa. She gained admission to the Writers' Workshop
where she began reading the works of James Joyce, Franz Kafka and
William Faulkner.
   ``She was influenced by the Workshop,'' Fitzgerald said. ``She
learned to spend a certain number of hours writing every day at the
same time. She let nothing interfere with it. She was very
disciplined about it.''
   O'Connor received a master of fine arts degree in 1947. That
same year, she began working on ``Wise Blood,'' her first novel. It
took five years and endless revisions before the book was published.
   ``She certainly suffered writing,'' Fitzgerald said. ``Writing
was very hard for her. She was a real perfectionist. She discarded
more than 2,000 sheets from `Wise Blood.'
   ``Ideas explored and abandoned. Working through inferences,
working through bad solutions to good solutions. Making that book
absolutely her own.''
   ``Wise Blood'' tells the story of Hazel Motes, an intense young
man who arrives in a small city in Georgia, determined to form a
``Church Without Christ.''
   In a letter dated March 2, 1954, O'Connor gave her own
interpretation of ``Wise Blood'':
   ```Wise Blood' is about a Protestant saint, written from the
point of view of a Catholic. ... First you must accept the fact
that this book is by someone who believes that there was a fall,
has been a Redemption, and will be a judgment. This is what I
believe as a Catholic and what I imply that Haze could not get away
from. ...''
   Man and God. The struggle against grace. Redemption. They were
the major themes of O'Connor's stories and her life.
   ``Redemption and incarnation was central to her,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``She thought of herself as writing from a Catholic point of
view. This is what all Catholics believe, everything has a
meaning.''
   Fitzgerald met O'Connor in 1949. ``She was quite silent. She
didn't talk a lot. She listened very carefully. If you were aware,
you realized you were in the presence of someone listening and
watching very carefully.''
   In O'Connor's stories, the eyes are often the most important
features of her characters' faces. Fitzgerald says the same was
true for O'Connor herself.
   ``She was a young girl, not particularly striking, until you
looked at her eyes, which were blue and penetrating. She was a
sandy-haired girl. Not somebody you would notice.''
   In 1950, O'Connor began to suffer pains and heaviness in her
arms and shoulder joints. Although at first she laughed off the
symptoms as psychosomatic, an excuse not to write, O'Connor was
eventually diagnosed as having lupus, an incurable disease that
eventually killed her in 1964.
   ``She bore it very well. We heard no complaints. She was quite
funny about it,'' Fitzgerald said.
   ``She had no idea what it was at first. When she learned how
serious it was, she must have been shocked. Her father had died of
the same disease. He died when she was 15.''
   Despite her weakened condition, O'Connor continued to work until
her death. She completed a second novel, published two collections
of short stories and was a prolific letter writer.
   She moved back to Georgia in 1950 and lived in Milledgeville
with her mother for the rest of her life.
   ``She believed in a character's capacity to change with grace,''
Fitzgerald said. ``She lived in the South, which was largely
Protestant. There were a number of do-it-yourself religions. She
was fascinated by what they would come up with.''
   In a 1957 essay, ``The Church and the Fiction Writer,'' O'Connor
summed up how religion shaped her writing:
   ``The Catholic writer, in so far as he has the mind of the
Church, will feel life from the standpoint of the central Christian
mystery; that it has, for all its horror, been found by God to be
worth dying for.
   ``When people have told me that because I am a Catholic, I
cannot be an artist, I have to reply, ruefully, that because I am a
Catholic, I cannot afford to be less than an artist.''
   Fitzgerald said O'Connor was concerned with ``durable matters.''
   ``These are the great questions that have concerned serious
artists throughout history,'' she said.
