Garry Poe has experienced many emotions in 20 years as the Rolling Hills High 
baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
There was the exhilaration of 1972, when the Titans upset El Segundo and the 
legendary Scott McGregor, 2-0, in the Southern Section 3-A semifinals. 
"McGregor was considered unbeatable," Poe said of the ex-Baltimore Oriole 
left-hander, who was 51-6 in his prep career. Rolling Hills went on to defeat 
Katella of Anaheim, 3-2, for the 3-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the disappointment of last season, when Rolling Hills lost five 
of its last six games to fall from first to fifth in the Bay League and drop 
out of playoff contention. "Everyone was looking for us to have a great year," 
Poe said. "Unfortunately, my rain dance didn't prove very efficient and we had 
to play the last six." 
</P>
<P>
And now there is the surprise of 1990. With only three returning starters and 
five seniors on the varsity, Rolling Hills was considered a year away from 
contending for the Bay League title. But the Titans overcame inexperience to 
tie Torrance and Beverly Hills for the championship, the school's first league 
title since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"A real pleasant surprise like this one is worth waiting for," Poe said. "The 
kids have been enthusiastic and upbeat the whole time. For 20 years it's been 
fun, but every once in a while you get surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Poe wants the surprises to continue Friday, when Rolling Hills (12-11) plays 
host to Angelus League runner-up St. Paul of Santa Fe Springs (17-9) at 3:15 
p.m. in the first round of the 5-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans haven't won a playoff game since 1984, and another early exit isn't 
out of the question. Poe didn't expect to get even this far after the 1989 team 
graduated its top three pitchers, two all-league outfielders and an all-league 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete make-over," Poe said. "We were so young, I really didn't 
expect a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills keeps surpassing expectations, especially when Kirt Kishita 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
The junior right-hander, the starting first baseman as a sophomore, beat every 
Bay League team on his way to a 7-1 record. Kishita (8-4 overall) also plays 
second base and ranks second on the team with a .403 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"He's improved so much," Poe said. "Most of it has been on-the-job training. 
He's done a wonderful job of keeping everything in balance. He's poised every 
time out. We feel so comfortable with him on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Tristan Paul is another junior who has played a key role. The shortstop and No. 
2 pitcher, Paul leads the Titans with a .408 average. "He's one of the better 
athletes in the area," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 of 17 varsity players returning, Rolling Hills could be looking at 
another championship season in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Poe can tell you, there are no sure things. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills continued a pre-playoff tradition Tuesday, splitting the team for 
a rousing game of Frisbee baseball at Torrance Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The seniors and sophomores beat the juniors and freshmen, 14-12, in seven 
innings. The game ended with runners on second and third. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit of a surprise," Poe said. "All those juniors thought they would 
outrun the seniors, but experience counts in Frisbee baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice break. Too much of the time you get caught in that grind during 
the season. You need a change of pace." 
</P>
<P>
Poe said much of the credit for the Titans' success belongs to walk-on 
assistant coaches Tom Papadakis and Tom Vick. 
</P>
<P>
"They help out part-time, but they're usually there at the right times," he 
said. "They did a great job of balancing me and keeping the kids in balance. 
The kids have responded so positively." 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 Rolling Hills team that won the 3-A Division title was led by pitchers 
Mike Ongarato and Tom Bondurant and catcher Phil LaFollette, a 5-foot-5, 
125-pounder who was named to the All-CIF first team. 
</P>
<P>
Ongarato was drafted out of high school and played triple-A ball for the Boston 
Red Sox. Bondurant pitched for Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Bondurant's biggest victory at Rolling Hills came when he won the duel with 
McGregor in the '72 semifinals. That season, the El Segundo ace was 17-2 with 
an 0.24 earned-run average and 175 strikeouts in 117 innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
McGregor's 51 career victories is still the Southern Section record. 
</P>
<P>
McGregor also holds the Southern Section record for consecutive shutouts with 
six in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Rob Croxall, El Segundo's current ace, is in the middle of a 
similar streak. He has not allowed a run in 30 consecutive innings since St. 
Anthony scored off him in the sixth inning of a Camino Real League game April 
5. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Croxall's impressive streak, Coach John Stevenson hasn't decided who 
will start El Segundo's Southern Section 2-A playoff opener Tuesday. The 
top-seeded Eagles (24-3) have a first-round bye Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Croxall, the team also has two capable starters in right-hander Tate 
Seefried and left-hander Jason Wayt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say (who will start)," Stevenson said. "We're going to go with at 
least two (starters in the playoffs), and it's nice to have that third one. I 
don't see it as a major issue. I think all three are good enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
Croxall is 9-1 with an 0.71 ERA, Seefried is 7-1 with a 1.58 ERA and Wayt is 
6-1 with a 2.62 ERA. In addition, junior Brian Wise, a left-hander, has a 2-0 
record and an 0.41 ERA. The Eagles boast an outstanding team ERA of 1.44. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to go back a long time to find (an El Segundo) staff that has this 
quality," Stevenson said. "We have four guys who would be aces on any other 
staff in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said he will probably decide on a starter for Tuesday's game after 
watching Santa Clara of Oxnard and Morro Bay play Friday. The winner meets El 
Segundo, the defending 2-A champion. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside girls' basketball Coach Frank Scott said there was a good chance he 
would have been hired as an assistant coach at Cal State Long Beach if Lisa 
Leslie had picked the 49ers instead of USC. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a strong possibility," he said Tuesday, one day after the 6-5 Leslie 
signed with USC. "But I'm not really disappointed. Who knows? Maybe I'll get 
the same offer at (USC). It's possible, but nothing is definite now." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he is pursuing a college job. He has coached Morningside for 10 
years, guiding the Lady Monarchs to two state titles, four Southern Section 
titles and eight consecutive league titles. 
</P>
<P>
"If something breaks, I might possibly be leaving," he said. "I'd say it's 
about 60-40 that I will be back at Morningside. I've done just about everything 
on this level. I'm ready to explore new territory." 
</P>
<P>
Sisters Brigit and Beth Tapp, two of the busiest athletes at West Torrance 
High, will help lead the Warrior softball team against visiting Laguna Beach at 
3 p.m. today in the first round of the Southern Section 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Brigit, a senior who bats lead-off, ranks second on the team with a .352 
average. She also has 21 steals. Beth, a sophomore who bats fifth, is fourth on 
the team with a .327 average. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third sport in which the sisters have competed this school year. 
They also played on the soccer and volleyball teams, and this summer they plan 
to compete on traveling softball teams. 
</P>
<P>
"They live this stuff 12 months out of the year," said Bob Tapp, the girls' 
father. 
</P>
<P>
West (17-5) tied South Torrance for the Ocean League title, while Laguna Beach 
(10-6) took third in the Pacific Coast League. South (17-3) plays host to 
Capistrano Valley (15-10) in another playoff opener today. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Bishop Montgomery and St. Bernard will hold a weightlifting 
competition from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday at Bishop Montgomery to raise funds 
for the schools' football programs. It will also give the teams a chance to get 
acquainted with each other before meeting next season as new members of the 
Mission League. . . . Former El Segundo baseball standout Jeremy Carr, freshman 
center fielder for Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, has been named to the 
All-Western State Conference first team. Carr, the left fielder on El Segundo's 
1989 2-A Division champion team, batted .321 with an on-base percentage of 
.615. He led the conference with 16 stolen bases and was named the conference's 
best defensive outfielder by the coaches.
