   A rare book by Edgar Allen Poe that a
Massachusetts man picked up for $15 in a New Hampshire barn was
auctioned for $198,000, putting the seller in a ``dream world,'' an
auction house official said.
   The first-edition copy of ``Tamerlane and Other Poems,'' only
the 12th known copy of Poe's first book published in 1827, was sold
at Sotheby's auction house Tuesday to a rare book dealer for less
than expected.
   Even so, the Massachusetts seller was `extremely happy,''
Sotheby's Vice President David Redden said. ``He's still in, I
think, a sort of dream world over the whole business.''
   The seller, who demanded anonymity said he found the book in an
antique barn in southern New Hampshire. The barn was not identified.
   Poe, who paid to have the book published by an obscure Boston
publisher, went on to write such classic poems and stories of
horror and romance as ``Annabel Lee,'' ``The Raven,'' and ``The
Tell-tale Heart.''
   ``It's the rarest book in American literature _ it's the most
famous book in American literature,'' said the buyer, Manhattan
book dealer James Cummins. ``It's the book that every rare book
seller hopes to get his hands on.''
   Cummins said he was buying the book for a ``serious book
collector'' from New York and was ``very pleased'' with the price,
which Sotheby's described as a record for a work of American
literature.
   Sotheby's had estimated the book's value at $200,000 to
$300,000. The $198,000 price includes the 10 percent commission
that goes to Sotheby's.
   The soft-cover book, which contains the long title poem and nine
shorter ones, bears no reference to Poe, listing the author only as
``a Bostonian.'' Although Poe was born in Boston, he lived there
only a few months before his parents moved to Richmond, Va. He
lived in Boston again for about eight weeks when ``Tamerlane'' was
published.
   The work had been written about five years earlier, when Poe was
12 or 13 years old. There is no indication that a single copy of
the book was ever sold, and it never has been highly regarded by
critics.
   Its value is considered historical more than literary, since it
is the first and rarest work by Poe.
   Of the 11 other known copies of ``Tamerlane,'' all but one are
owned by libraries or other institutions. The only other one in
private hands is on loan to the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York.
   Also sold Tuesday were four handwritten notebooks by Nobel
laureate Saul Bellow that comprised the rough draft of his 1970
novel, ``Mr. Sammler's Planet.''
   The notebooks, believed to be the first archive of a major
living author's published work to be auctioned during his life,
brought $66,000.
