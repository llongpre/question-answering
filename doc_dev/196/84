The Santa Clarita City Council on Friday reaffirmed its decision to file a 
lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to overturn the 
board's approval of a 2,555-unit addition to the giant Stevenson Ranch housing 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The council met during a special meeting called to reconsider the lawsuit and 
the council's recent decision to oust a member of the city's Parks and 
Recreation Commission. On the parks issue, the council reversed itself, 
reappointing Commissioner Laurene Weste to a new term on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit will challenge the adequacy of the environmental impact report 
prepared for the Stevenson Ranch expansion. Councilman Carl Boyer III, speaking 
after the council's deliberations, said the report was deficient, limited in 
scope and based on old data. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson Ranch, which the developer hopes to expand to 10,000 units, is 
situated west of the Golden State Freeway and south of Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer said the environmental report prepared for the developer, Dale Poe 
Development Corp., fails to consider how much traffic the project will funnel 
into Santa Clarita, which is east of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer said the lawsuit might be filed as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted recently to sue the county, but in an unusual move 
reconsidered its decision Friday afternoon at the request of Mayor Jo Anne 
Darcy. Darcy said she wanted the council to be aware of the potential impacts 
of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy is a field deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who 
supports the project. To avoid a conflict of interest, Darcy did not attend the 
closed session held to discuss the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Poe, as a condition of winning county approval for the project, has agreed 
to donate 13 acres and $2.4 million for a new school in the fast-growing 
Newhall School District. The company will donate more money and land as other 
phases of the project are approved. Donations ultimately could total $22 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, said the school district hoped to 
obtain the money by November so it could apply for a matching contribution from 
the state. A lawsuit could jeopardize the district's ability to receive those 
funds, Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in open session on the parks issue, the council re-evaluated a 
numerical ranking system it had used to rate the candidates vying for three 
slots on the commission. Candidates were rated on a scale of one to five. 
</P>
<P>
Weste was ousted from the panel even though she had received fives from Darcy, 
Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon and Boyer. Councilwoman Jill Klajic gave 
Weste a zero and Councilwoman Jan Heidt gave her a one. 
</P>
<P>
Weste was replaced by George Stigile while Commissioners Jeff Wheeler and Todd 
Longshore were reappointed to new terms. Stigile lost his seat after the 
reappointment of Weste. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said he was disturbed that a minority of the council could control an 
appointment. Council members said Friday that they should use the ranking 
system only as a guide for appointments. The council set aside its previous 
action and renamed Weste, Wheeler and Longshore to the commission.
