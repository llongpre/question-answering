<LEADPARA>  Sylvester Stallone's advice to a group of drama students was as direct as a
Rocky Balboa uppercut: Tell lies on your resume.;   "That's very important;
you must lie," Stallone told a University of Virginia audience Friday in
Charlottesville.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "That's not what we teach them here," drama professor Bob Chapel
interrupted.;   Stallone had other pointers.;   "You have to have blind faith
in yourself," he said. It also helps to "make friends with depression and
failure.";   And there was this practical advice: "Don't just be an actor if
you can be more.";   Stallone visited the Charlottesville campus because of
his interest in Edgar Allen Poe, who attended the university.  </TEXT>
