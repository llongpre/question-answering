   Diplomats said Monday that
government troops in Liberia had killed an American missionary, and
there were reports that one of Liberia's rebel factions had reached
an informal truce with the government.
   The missionary, a Baptist, was killed by government troops who
arrested him Thursday, according to diplomats. They said the body
of the slain man, identified as Clark Alan Jacobsen, 42, of
Sterling, Alaska, was handed over to the U.S. Embassy on Saturday.
   The embassy was filing a formal protest with the government, the
diplomats said. They did not say why Jacobsen was detained.
   Jacobsen traveled to Liberia last September with Joel Poe of
Sterling as missionaries for the Sterling-based Frontiers of Faith
Ministries.
   Poe returned to Alaska in October but Jacobsen stayed to
continue his mission work, according to Poe, who said Jacobsen had
planned to return home next month.
   A second American arrested and accused of fighting for the
rebels, Andrew Voros of New Jersey, was freed Saturday and
evacuated from Monrovia by U.S. Marines, the diplomats said.
   Jacobsen was the second American known to have died in Liberia's
8-month-old civil war, which has left at least 5,000 people dead,
most of them civilians.
   A Protestant missionary, Tom Jackson, and his British wife June
were killed March 24 near Bahn, a town in northeastern Nimba county
where they had lived for years. They were forced by soldiers to
travel in a convoy that was ambushed by guerrillas loyal to rebel
leader Charles Taylor.
   Most of the 6,000 Americans who had livedin Liberia were
missionaries. After the deaths of the Jacksons, the U.S. Embassy in
Monrovia put out the first of several warnings for Americans to
leave.
   Meanwhile, followers of rebel leader Prince Johnson and troops
loyal to President Samuel Doe told a Western diplomat they were
prepared to join forces to resist a possible attack by rebels from
a rival faction opposed to the truce.
   Those rebels, led by Taylor, are camped out on the outskirts of
the capital, Monrovia.
   There was no official announcement of a cease-fire from either
Johnson or Doe. News of the truce was received in a radio telephone
call from diplomats in Monrovia to their embassies in Abidjan,
capital of neighboring Ivory Coast.
   ``The diplomat said he found AFL (Armed Forces of Liberia) and
INPF (Independent National Patriotic Front) troops dancing in the
streets, saying it was all over,'' said one diplomat in Abidjan. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``As part of the celebration, they were throwing money into the
air and both lots of soldiers together with some civilians in the
streets were looting what was left in the stores,'' the diplomat
said.
   He said there was speculation that the lower ranks of the
military and the Prince Johnson rebel faction ``patched it up
themselves because everybody is thoroughly fed up with the whole
thing.''
   The rebellion to oust Doe reached Monrovia in June. Since then,
the city has been battered by rockets and mortars. Bodies litter
the streets and all the hospitals are closed.
   Government soldiers and rebels have plundered shops and homes
and beleaguered residents have been without fresh food supplies,
water, electricity and telephone communication for nearly two
months.
   It was unclear if Monday's truce would hold. The cease-fire
comes as West African leaders trying to halt the fighting prepare
for a peace conference scheduled to start next week in Banjul,
Gambia.
   Taylor and Doe plan to send envoys to the meeting. Johnson, who
split with Taylor in February and formed a rival faction, has also
said he would attend.
   A six-nation task force of the Economic Community of West
African States was mobilizing in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to sail to
Monrovia to enforce a truce.
   Thousands of Guinean troops have been stationed on Liberia's
northwestern border since Taylor's rebels began crossing into
Guinea to kill Liberian refugees of the Mandingo tribe. Taylor's
rebels have accused the Mandingo of supporting Doe.
