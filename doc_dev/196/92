In her insightful introduction to "The Book of Fantasy," Ursula K. Le Guin 
reflects on how fantasy today has become a business. One need only to visit the 
nearest bookstore-in-a-mall to see that this is so. Rows upon rows of gaudily 
packaged "fantasy" paperbacks are there to be consumerized. 
</P>
<P>
What is disconcerting is their turgid sameness. Their covers and texts would 
suggest that fantasy is primarily concerned with semi-nude barbarians and 
Amazons who are forever slaying each other with glowing swords. There are 
certainly some exceptions, but most current fiction parading as fantasy 
displays a paucity of imagination that is deadening to the soul. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, "The Book of Fantasy" provides a woodshed of tales, parables and 
fragments to rekindle the fire of our imagination. Borges and his friends have 
plucked paradoxes from the mists of ancient centuries, gathered tales of whimsy 
and revenge from the more discernible past, while adding modern stories of both 
apocalyptic dread and persistent hope. They have harvested these works from 
nearly every era and continent on Earth. Though the scope of their differences 
is enormous, they all share a special capacity to invite the reader to expand 
his world by challenging the static perceptions of reality.

Much of the intrinsic charm of this anthology stems from its unusual inception. 
Although published now for the first time in English, it is no 
hastily-thrown-together product of some publisher's desire to capitalize on a 
fashionable trend. Rather its birth was on a rare evening in Buenos Aires, in 
1937, when Jorge Luis Borges, Silvina Ocampo and A. Bioy Casares, three friends 
with literate and discerning minds, had the simple but pure idea to bring 
together a volume of fantasy based solely on what they liked best.

One cannot help but wonder how they arrived at their choices. Was there much 
argument? Why did they select Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Earth's Holocaust," an 
oddly expository parable about the world's population divesting itself of all 
institutional and intellectual trappings by throwing virtually everything, 
including books, into a giant conflagration? Surely one of them must have 
pointed out the superiority of Hawthorne's darkly alluring "Rappaccini's 
Daughter." Perhaps they thought it was too commonly known.

It is easier to imagine them all eagerly assenting to Max Beerbohm's "Enoch 
Soames." This masterpiece of cynical humor about a frustrated writer who sells 
his soul to the devil for a chance to check out his literary reputation 100 
years hence is a wonderfully welcome old friend. For those readers who remember 
it only as through a high school assignment dimly, its caustically precise 
dissection of artistic vanity is a joy to re-behold.

Their decision to open the volume with "Sennin" by the Japanese writer, 
Ryunosuke Akutagawa, was inspired. "Sennin" is a beautiful fable that 
demonstrates how the power of true belief, no matter how bizarre, can conquer 
the forces of those who accept nothing that reaches beyond the barriers of 
small-minded reality. An enchanting tale, it also aids the reader joyfully to 
embrace the suspension of disbelief that he needs to fully explore the 
labyrinths in the pages just ahead.

Here are tales of fantastic joy, terror and fear, satire and irony, and 
ugliness and beauty. Classics of horror such as W. W. Jacobs' "The Monkey's 
Paw" are juxtaposed with the ephemeral brevity of A. A. Ireland's six-line 
"Ending for a Ghost Story." The former drenches one in dread, while the latter 
clears the palate with a draught of delight. 
</P>

Over the years, a few more contemporary pieces have been added. The most 
successful of these is J. G. Ballard's "The Drowned Giant." This bitter, yet 
superbly crafted tale tells of the brutal fate that a giant's corpse suffers at 
the hands of callous humanity after it is washed up on an ocean beach. With 
this story alone, Ballard may lay claim to the misanthropic mantle of Jonathan 
Swift. 
</P>
<P>
Borges and his colleagues have yoked together such disparate geniuses as Franz 
Kafka and Lord Dunsany; Chaung Tzu and Edgar Allan Poe; Oscar Wilde and Borges 
himself. Somehow, they all fit. 
</P>
<P>
"The Book of Fantasy" is one of those marvelous volumes that are not meant to 
be read at a gallop. Rather, each story should be savored and mulled over, 
discussed and argued about in front of a winter fire or on the back porch on a 
hot mid-summer's day. This book should be passed around from friend to friend, 
from parent to child, from lover to lover. It is a book of true fantasy and 
therefore filled with the wonder of boundless thought.
