THE CHILDREN OF MEN by P D James Faber Pounds 14.99, 239 pages
ALTHOUGH PD James has her regular police-detective Adam Dalgliesh, she does
not flog him to death in book after book. Adam does not appear at all in her
latest novel, The Children of Men, set in the future. PD James has never
been content, like many of her colleagues, merely to repeat a well-tried
formula in a familiar setting. When he is not on the job solving crimes, her
criminal investigator writes poetry. This clearly responds to the two sides
of his creator's character - the organisation woman and the creative artist.
While always scrupulous in fulfilling the requirements of the genre - a
suspenseful mystery that is cleared up in the last chapter - PD James has
made several attempts to extend its frontiers. Her models are writers like
Poe, GK Chesterton, Dorothy L. Sayers and in this latest book the 'holy
'tec' writer Charles Williams, rather than Agatha Christie. PD James has a
taste for the ghoulish, for gallows-humour and macabre liturgical setpieces
that Poe would have relished. At times she resembles a nursing sister who
allows you your sweetie only when you have swallowed the bitter spoonful of
medicine. 'The whole earth is our hospital', said TS Eliot, 'Endowed by a
ruined millionaire,/ Wherein, if we do well, we shall/ Die of the absolute
paternal care/ That will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere.' If not
true absolutely, that is certainly a very accurate description of the world
of PD James.
Unfortunately her maternal evangelism swamps this story, which is one of her
weakest. It is set in the year 2021 but in spite of this can hardly be
classified as science fiction. Science in any shape or form is no part of
this author's repertory. There is little attempt to make an imaginative leap
into what life might be like at that period in terms of scientific advance.
Sources of energy remain the same, cars seem to have gone back to the time
when they regularly got punctures on bumpy roads, some food is still sold in
tins and opened with an old-fashioned tin-opener. All this in a cosily
crumbling England represented by the city and county of Oxford where many of
the ancient buildings and institutions survive (though someone should have
explained to PD James that they do not teach undergraduates at All Souls).
It is not any kind of progress we experience in the book but deliberate
regress. The country is in a condition of terminal decline. It is run by a
single party government whose central committee is obedient to the will of a
dictator known as the Warden. He is one of those charming, well-born,
extrovert, English public school specimens of leadership, the type much
admired by bachelor-novelists of an earlier generation like EM Forster and
LP Hartley, and as in that tradition alternately loved and hated by the
narrator. The rivalry of these two men, originating in their childhood, is
the only convincing human factor in this novel.
The premise of the plot is that human fertility - the ability of women to
bear children - seems completely to have ceased. The last generation of
children was born in the year 1995. These Omegas, as they are called,
frustrated by their sterility, have become a sinister group within society
practising primitive tribal rites and responsible for frequent outbreaks of
murderous violence. For the rest what is depicted is a largely geriatric
community in which mass suicide is encouraged by the authorities. We watch a
ceremony known as the Quietus whereby senior citizens are rowed out to sea
in leaky boats and are abandoned as they start to float to their watery
graves. Any non-conformity is punished by exile to an off-shore penal colony
administered by its own mafia. Shakespeare's other Eden has turned into one
big, cruelly run, old people's home.
This state-of-the-nation metaphor is promisingly Orwellian, but it is
squandered. A small dissident group of Christian activists, meeting secretly
in disused museums and churches, attempts to overthrow the central
government. Their efforts read for the most part like a true-blue Girls' Own
yarn as they steal a car and flee from their pursuers through rural
Oxfordshire. The narrator is dragged unwillingly into the conspiracy and
falls for the heroine who shares a man's name - Julian - with an English
mediaeval woman saint. When this Julian begins to grow round-bellied, her
fellow-outcasts are incredulous. Could she be . . ? If so, hers will be the
most wanted pregnancy of all time save One. Read on - if you dare. Meanwhile
let us pray for the return soon of Dalgliesh.
