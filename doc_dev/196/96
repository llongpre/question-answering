   Some Southerners look at Monument Avenue's
stately statues of Confederate heroes and see ``the most beautiful
street in America.'' Some Northerners look at the same scene and
see ``Losers' Lane.''
   Norrece T. Jones Jr. looks out on the statue of J.E.B. Stuart
from his apartment, and he sees human suffering.
   ``When I see those monuments, I think of people who enslaved
African Americans. I can never look at them dispassionately or
indifferently,'' says Jones, professor of Afro-American history at
Virginia Commonwealth University.
   One hundred years after Robert E. Lee became the first son of
the South to be memorialized on Monument Avenue, the 140-foot-wide
thoroughfare symbolizes both the scars of slavery and the elegance
of a time long ago.
   It is ``more than a Confederate Valhalla,'' says Edwin J. Slipek
Jr., director of the avenue's centennial celebration. ``It's a
linear Central Park or town square, tracking the development of an
American city.''
   The 62-foot-tall statue of Lee on his horse was dedicated on
Memorial Day in 1890. Jeb Stuart and Jefferson Davis followed up in
1907, Stonewall Jackson in 1919 and Matthew Fontaine Maury,
``Pathfinder of the Sea,'' in 1927.
   By the 1920s, Monument Avenue was Richmond's most prestigious
address. Douglas Southall Freeman, the Richmond historian whose
writing about Lee won the Pulitzer Prize, doffed his hat whenever
he passed ``Marse Lee.''
   ``They didn't start out by saying, `We're going to dedicate a
street to the men who lost the Civil War,'' said Robert Winthrop,
an architectural historian.
   Instead, the row of statues grew ``piece by piece,'' he said.
``If the city government was focused on a memorial to the Lost
Cause it might be different.''
   George Callcott, professor of Southern history at the University
of Maryland, said: ``One of the things American historians have
noticed is the South's preoccupation with the past. Monument Avenue
is an indicator of that.''
   John Zehmer, executive director of the Historic Richmond
Foundation, is among those who suggest Monument Avenue is not so
much a commemoration of Confederate heroes as a display of fine art.
   Still, when other statues were proposed through the years _
non-Civil War types like Thomas Jefferson, Woodrow Wilson, William
Henry Harrison and Edgar Allan Poe, among them _ none was built.
   In the late 1970s, when Richmond first elected a city council
with a black majority, the outgoing administration feared that
blacks would move or tear down the Lee monument. So the whites
deeded Robert E. Lee to the state.
   But Henry Marsh, the city's first black mayor, laid a wreath at
the Jefferson Davis monument, assuring the United Daughters of the
Confederacy that he was ``mayor of all the city.''
   ``The city had never experienced what they perceived as black
control and didn't know what to expect,'' Marsh said. The avenue,
he says today, is ``one of the great boulevards in the world.''
   Monument Avenue is a haven to joggers and children who frolic on
the grassy, tree-lined median. It is an avenue of mansions _ the
average home is 5,000 square feet, with a half-dozen fireplaces,
four bathrooms, maids quarters, and a dozen rooms on three floors.
   Some of the houses have been sold to new owners who find them
too large to handle and turn them into offices and apartments.
   Some have been purchased by newcomers eager to buy a mansion for
a relatively cheap price; Ceci Amrhein, a real estate broker who is
also co-chairwoman of the centennial, said a house in need of major
renovation is on the market for $250,000, while another, fully
renovated, sold for $775,000.
   The centennial has had its goofy side, including a croquet
festival, billed at ``the world's largest croquet match,'' on the
avenue's lawns.
   But when, as part of the celebration, a jazz group was invited
to play, black youths in the band refused to perform under the
statue of Lee, Jones said. The band moved the show a block away.
   ``The Civil War, in essence, was fought to preserve a certain
culture _ that culture predicated on the enslavement of hundreds of
thousands of African Americans,'' Jones said.
   Though he can look out of his window and see the statue of
Stuart, renowned as one of the best cavalry commanders of the Army
of Northern Virginia, Jones says he enjoys living there.
   The building in which he lives, designed by architect William
Lawrence Bottomley, is on the Virginia Historic Register and the
National Register of Historic Places. He enjoys the model of a
Claes Oldenburg sculpture on a neighbor's lawn _ the sculpture
depicts not a war hero, but a clothespin.
   And there have been signs of change. The Virginia chapter of the
American Institute of Architects held a mock competition for a new
sculpture on Monument Avenue, and drew responses from 250
architecture students.
   The most popular subject? Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the
first black elected chief executive of any state.
