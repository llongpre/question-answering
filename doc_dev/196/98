   John Wesley Fletcher, the last of six
defendants to come to court on federal charges in the PTL scandal,
has pleaded guilty to a single perjury count.
   Fletcher was accused of lying to a grand jury about his bringing
Jessica Hahn to Florida to meet Jim Bakker for the sexual encounter
that led to the downfall of the PTL television ministry.
   Fletcher entered his plea Tuesday in an unpublicized session at
U.S. District Court in Charlotte. U.S. District Judge Robert Potter
accepted the plea but did not set a sentencing date.
   Fletcher, who was a frequent guest on the jailed Bakker's ``PTL
Club'' television show, was indicted in December.
   According to the indictment, Fletcher denied during a September
1987 appearance before the grand jury that he brought Miss Hahn to
a hotel to have sex with Bakker. Testifying later, he admitted sex
was the purpose of the meeting, according to the indictment.
   Fletcher, 50, is free on $25,000 unsecured bond. Late last
month, he was released from the Butner Federal Correctional
Institution, where he underwent a lengthy psychiatric evaluation.
   In his order releasing Fletcher, U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor
said Butner official Deborah Poe informed him that the evaluation
was completed.
   ``Ms. Poe had advised that there is nothing in the report of Mr.
Fletcher's evaluation indicating that he would be a danger to
himself or the community,'' Taylor wrote in his April 25 order.
   Fletcher is believed to be living in the Durham area.
   Under the plea agreement, Potter said he could sentence Fletcher
to a reduced term of eight to 14 months in prison. Fletcher had
faced five years and a $250,000 fine.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year prison sentence in Minnesota. He was
convicted of 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy in October; he is
appealing the conviction.
   Former PTL executive vice president Richard Dortch is serving a
30-month sentence on related charges; former Bakker aides David and
James Taggart are serving long terms for federal income tax
evasion. Perjury charges against former PTL pastor Sam Johnson were
dropped.
