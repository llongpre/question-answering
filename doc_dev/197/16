<LEADPARA>  One day after quarterbacking Colorado to an Orange Bowl victory and its first
national championship, Charles S. Johnson said he won't play football next
season as a fifth-year senior.;    Johnson, a 5-foot-11, 165-pounder who was
voted the Orange Bowl's most valuable player, said his professional football
prospects are slim, but he plans to interview with Pepsi for an internship and
plans to take a June entrance examination for law school.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  MIAMI CONTRITE: Citing his team's behavior in the Cotton Bowl, University of
Miami President Edward T. Foote II said he would meet soon with Coach Dennis
Erickson and would conduct his search for a new athletic director with the
Hurricanes' 202 yards in penalties fresh on his mind.;    By halftime of their
46-3 rout of Texas, the Hurricanes had already set a Cotton Bowl record for
yards penalized, with 132. Athletic Director Sam Jankovich, who is leaving to
take control of the NFL New England Patriots, sent a message to Erickson in
the locker room: The antics had to stop.;    Miami then was penalized 70 more
yards in the second half.; ETC.: Notre Dame flanker-kick returner Raghib
Ismail is talking of turning professional instead of returning for a senior
season, and Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz isn't sure he'll be back either. Holtz
is facing an NCAA inquiry into his two-year tenure as Minnesota's coach before
he came to Notre Dame. "But I hope to be back at Notre Dame -- if they want
me," Holtz said. . . . Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan underwent surgery
Wednesday on his left knee, injured in the Buffaloes' 10-9 Orange Bowl victory
over Notre Dame, and doctors said he would be immobilized for about six weeks.  </TEXT>
