<LEADPARA>  Colorado was voted the No. 1 college football team in the land Wednesday by
the Associated Press in the poll that counts most widely.;    But when various
other polls were taken into account, the Buffaloes and Georgia Tech split the
vote for the national championship, renewing calls for an NCAA playoff system.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COLORADO WINS A SPLIT DECISION
AP PICKS BUFFS, BUT UPI DOESN'T  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     After nipping Notre Dame 10-9 in the Orange Bowl on Tuesday night, Colorado
(11-1-1) won the final Associated Press poll handily, beating Georgia Tech
(11-0-1) in first-place votes 39-20.;    But the Yellow Jackets, who defeated
Nebraska 45-21 in the Citrus Bowl on Tuesday, edged Colorado 847-846 in the
final United Press International coaches' poll announced six hours later.
Georgia Tech received 30 first-place votes and Colorado 27 in the UPI list.
Neither school had finished No. 1 in a major poll.;    The next four teams
were identical in both polls -- Miami third, Florida State fourth, Washington
fifth and Notre Dame sixth.;    It's the first time the two major wire-service
polls have disagreed on the national champion since 1978, when the AP picked
Alabama and UPI picked Southern Cal. Sixty sportswriters and broadcasters vote
in the AP poll, which is printed by more newspapers and other media outlets,
including the Mercury News, and is considered by most as the primary source
for rankings. The UPI poll has an air of authenticity, however, because its
teams are selected by 59 Division I-A coaches. In the 41 years the polls have
co-existed, they have picked different champions eight times at season's end.;
   Colorado Coach Bill McCartney and Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross, along with
their players, said they hoped a playoff would be available to decide future
seasons.;    "I'm just like the rest of you. When I see that NCAA basketball
tournament bracket with 64 teams, I can't wait to see them play it all off,"
said McCartney, whose team won its second Big Eight Conference title in a row
this season. "I love the Final Four and all of that, and I think something
like that would be great for college football. When you put something like
this up to a vote, there's no way it can satisfy everybody. You just can't
satisfy everybody without a playoff.";    Ross, whose team was Atlantic Coast
Conference champion, said: "A playoff system would be good. I've been a
supporter of that from day one. But I'd like to see it devised through the
bowl system, because they have been so good to us.";    Georgia Tech
cornerback Willie Clay said, "I wish the system was better. It's hard when
someone else controls your fate. . . . We were just upset because we never had
a chance to play Colorado one-on-one.";    Although McCartney and Ross were
willing to share the pie, neither was completely satisfied. (Each voted for
his own team in the UPI poll; Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said he had voted
Colorado No. 1.);    "We played the most difficult schedule in Division I-A,"
McCartney said. "We came into the Orange Bowl ranked No. 1, and we won. The
margin of victory is not the issue. The issue is who wins or loses. Just
beating Notre Dame is enough to hang your hat on for the national
championship.";    Countered Ross: "I'm disappointed that we weren't named No.
1 in the AP poll." The coach then outlined why his squad should have won that
vote, too.;    "One, we are the only undefeated team in the country, and that
should say something," Ross said. "Two, 10 of the 12 teams we played this
season had winning records. Three, there has been a lot of criticism regarding
the strength of the ACC. I think the conference was vindicated, however, by
the teams' performance in bowl games. They did very well (3-1-1) in those
games. Four, I felt that we played Nebraska in a comparable way to that of
Colorado (the Buffaloes won 27-12 at Nebraska). On that basis, our undefeated
record should atone for any difference.";    In most seasons, the lone
unbeaten team in the field has more or less inherited the national
championship. The last time the only unbeaten team didn't sweep the
national-title wire polls was in 1982, when an 11-0-1 Southern Methodist team
finished second in both major polls behind 11-1 Penn State.;    Miami, a 46-3
winner over Texas in the Cotton Bowl, can take some solace from the fact that
the New York Times' computer picked Miami No. 1, Georgia Tech No. 2 and
Colorado No. 3. It arrives at its ranking by figuring in scheduling strength,
locations and recency of games. It is purposely skewed more toward
end-of-the-season results. But the Times' computer does not boast nearly the
weight of the AP and UPI votes.;    In the other minor polls besides the
Times', Colorado was named to the top spot by USA Today/CNN, the National
sports daily and the National Football Foundation.;    Colorado's loss (23-22
to Illinois) and a tie (31-31 with Tennessee), made the Buffaloes' record
among the worst for a national champion, and a controversial fifth-down
victory over Missouri also won't add to the team's historical legacy.;   
Colorado, which ended its season with 10 straight victories, became only the
second team to win the AP title with both a loss and a tie since the AP
started its poll in 1936. Alabama took the 1965 title with a 9-1-1 record. No
team has been voted national champ with two losses. Georgia Tech's only
blemish was a 13-13 tie with North Carolina in Chapel Hill, N.C.;  THE FINAL
