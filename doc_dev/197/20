Only two weeks into the college football season, injuries have sidelined 
several standout players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Houston wide receiver Manny Hazard, who had an NCAA-record 142 catches last 
season, will be out for three weeks because of a dislocated elbow suffered in 
the Cougars' 37-9 victory over Nevada Las Vegas on Saturday. Houston is ranked 
18th. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alabama running back Siran Stacy, the team's leading rusher, underwent 
surgery on his right knee and is out for the season. Stacy's top backup, 
Derrick Lassic, also was injured Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tennessee's Chuck Webb, who rushed for 1,236 yards last season, suffered 
torn knee ligaments during a 55-7 rout of Pacific Sept. 1 and will be sidelined 
for the season.

The Orange Bowl Committee rejected an offer to move to Joe Robbie Stadium and 
decided to keep the New Year's night game in its namesake home of 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some committee members argued that the rundown condition of the Orange Bowl 
made necessary a switch to three-year-old Joe Robbie Stadium, located north of 
the city limits but still in Dade County. Other members said moving out of the 
Orange Bowl, near Miami's downtown, would cost the city money and harm its 
image.

Greg Jones, starting quarterback for West Virginia, has been cleared for 
practice after suffering a concussion against Maryland, Coach Don Nehlen said. 
Jones, a fifth-year senior from Miami, Fla., backed up Steve Walsh and Vinny 
Testaverde at Miami before transferring to West Virginia after the 1986 season. 
He had backed up Major Harris the past two seasons.
