<LEADPARA>  All it took was a Notre Dame loss for bowl representatives to smile and
scratch their heads at the Jan. 1 possibilities.;   How about a Cal-Notre Dame
showdown in the Fiesta Bowl?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "That certainly would be a possibility," Warren Goodrich, a Fiesta Bowl
representative, said Saturday after Tennessee upset Notre Dame 35-34 in South
Bend, Ind.;   "That would be a tremendous matchup.";   Next Sunday is the
first day bowl officials can officially extend bids to teams, and the Notre
Dame-Penn State and Miami-Florida State showdowns next Saturday could force
last-minute decisions.;   Goodrich said Notre Dame's loss expanded the matchup
possibilities.;   Sugar Bowl secretary Chuck Zatarain said Penn State, Cal,
Miami and Notre Dame are on his short list of teams being considered to play
soon-to-be Southeastern Conference champion Florida. But Penn State and Notre
Dame have two losses apiece.;   "Cal and Florida at 10-1 would be an excellent
Sugar Bowl," Zatarain said.;   The 20-member Sugar Bowl Committee will meet
Monday morning to determine "what direction" to take, Zatarain said.;   It
will consider the strength of schedules, fan support and attendance.;  
Florida Citrus Bowl scout Elmer Cook said Penn State and Cal are on his short
list. He added that fan attendance is no longer an issue now that Clemson is a
virtual lock to sew up the Atlantic Coast Conference title and an automatic
berth in his bowl.;   One of the major issues still undecided is whether the
Fiesta Bowl would switch its starting time with the Hall of Fame Bowl. Both
are televised by NBC, and the Pacific 10 and Big Ten conferences prohibit
their teams from playing in bowls that conflict with the Rose Bowl on ABC.;  
"We hope to get this resolved soon," Goodrich said.;   Cal Athletic Director
Bob Bockrath said he was hopeful that decision would come as early as today.; 
 "We deserve to be in a Jan. 1 bowl, and the Sugar Bowl appeals with the money
($3.5 million payout to each team last season)," Bockrath said. "The Fiesta
and Florida Citrus bowls are excellent. . . . We couldn't go wrong."  </TEXT>
