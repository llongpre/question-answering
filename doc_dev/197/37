<TEXT>     It should be pointed out that Neinas considers himself "an above-average
football fan," which qualifies as a huge understatement. Neinas, the executive
director of the College Football Association, wants to keep up with all the
action.;    But it's not possible. His eyes don't move quickly enough, and
even the fastest remote control in the West would be woefully lacking.;   
"Eight games," Neinas says. "It's too much. It's not fair to the fans.";   
Especially for those fans with only one television set.;    Just when you
thought they couldn't stuff any more games into that overstuffed bag that is
New Year's Day, the bowls went ahead and did it. Starting at 8:30 a.m. with
the Gator Bowl and ending around 9 p.m. with the Sugar Bowl, there will be
eight games today, a football hater's worst nightmare.;    Eight is enough; 
And it's hardly a dream for the bowls, either. For them, eight is more than
enough. In fact, eight is ridiculous. Furthermore, eight is one of the reasons
some of critics suggest the bowl system could be in trouble in the 1990s.;   
The glut of games on Jan. 1 has the bowls extremely nervous. So do falling TV
ratings and the ever-expanding NFL season, which could squeeze several bowls
out of business. Then there's the threat that proceeds from corporate sponsors
might be subject to taxation, along with flaws in the selection process, which
has many in the college establishment fuming and screaming for a playoff.;   
Indeed, this is not the best of times for the folks who run the bowl kingdom.;
   "We're not dead yet," said the Orange Bowl's Steve Hatchell, the head of
the College Bowl Association.;    But there are signs that the castle walls
are cracking. Nowhere is it more evident than the erosion of television
ratings, a lifeblood for the bowls, on New Year's Day.;    In a former life .
. .;    For years, Jan. 1 was the domain of the Rose, Sugar, Cotton and Orange
bowls, and they enjoyed the spoils. In 1981, the four bowls averaged an
impressive 19.9 ranking. The 1979 Rose Bowl had a 29.2 rating.;    However, in
1982, the Fiesta Bowl moved to Jan. 1. Last year, there were seven games on
that day.;    The glut's fallout could be inevitable. With ratings down,
rights fees from the networks might be reduced. And with exposure diminished,
corporate sponsors, which pay a significant portion of the bowls' ticket,
might think twice about writing the next check.;    "There's little question
the television marketplace is flattening out in the 1990s," said Big Ten
Commissioner Jim Delany, whose conference has a lucrative tie-in to the Rose
Bowl. "Sure, there's a concern.";    "How far can the television dollar go?"
Hatchell said. "Overexposure in an undistinguished market could be
detrimental.";    The obvious solution would be for the bowls to work together
to find remedies to their problems. But the bowls appear to be their own worst
enemies.;    The urgency to work together, though, might be greater than it's
ever been. Besides the ratings difficulties, the expansion of the NFL regular
season -- which goes to the last weekend in December -- significantly reduces
time slots available to the bowls, at least as far as television is
concerned.;    There's also the threat from the Internal Revenue Service.
Currently, the majority of the bowls take in large sums of money from
corporate sponsors. Because bowls are considered non-profit organizations,
those funds haven't been taxed. But the IRS is doing audits to see whether it
should change its policy.;    Hatchell and former Fiesta Bowl head Bruce
Skinner maintain the situation isn't as bleak as it seems. Revenues have gone
up, and payouts continue to grow every year.;    They maintain the system is
healthy, even if others disagree.;    "It's not in as bad a state as some
people have portrayed it," said the Orange Bowl's Hatchell. "There are a lot
of games with incredible interest. There's a lot of good football being
played.;    "Sure, we need some fine-tuning. That doesn't hurt in any
industry.";    But if the problems continue to mount, the bowls could go from
some fine-tuning to a complete overhaul. Even then, the day might come when
the schedule again calls for only four games on Jan. 1.;    Otherwise known as
the national quarterfinals.;   BOWL GAMES AT A GLANCE; Bowl/
