<TEXT>   For the past three months, Charles S. Johnson has been haunted by a lasting
image. It was Johnson who directed Colorado's controversial fifth-down score
that beat Missouri on Oct. 6, evoking considerable outrage and inspiring
various jokes.;    "It's always that one play, that fifth down," Johnson said
after a recent practice, when the subject arose again. "I'm always going to be
remembered for that one play, not the game, and that's what bothers me about
this whole thing.";    Johnson can relax now. He came off the bench in the
second half Tuesday night, when starting quarterback Darian Hagan suffered a
knee injury, and quickly directed a legal touchdown drive to give Colorado a
10-9 Orange Bowl victory over Notre Dame and an almost certain national
championship.;    The Buffaloes (11-1-1), who came into the game ranked No. 1,
were denied their first national title by the Irish at last year's Orange
Bowl. They should take some solace in the fact that no team in NCAA history
that has gone into a bowl ranked No. 1 and has won its game has been passed
over for the championship.;    "Historically, when you're ranked No. 1 and you
go in and play a team as worthy as Notre Dame and beat them in a game like
this, then you should hold your ranking," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney said.
"Comparative scores mean nothing. We deserve to maintain our ranking. . . .
When you hold a team like Notre Dame to nine points, that's a significant
thing.";    There are sure to be people in Atlanta and points beyond who argue
that a precedent should come now. Some critics have pointed to the fifth-down
controversy at Missouri, saying Colorado should not have been here in the
first place. No. 2 Georgia Tech beat Nebraska decisively Tuesday and finished
unbeaten.;    Colorado, however, seems almost a lock to be named the champion
today. The Buffaloes played the most difficult schedule of any Division I team
this season, facing six top-20 teams. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch recently
polled 47 of 60 media members who vote for the national championship. Of those
respondents, 33 said the five downs would not affect their thinking. Seven
said they would refuse to vote for Colorado, and seven said they were
undecided.;    "I certainly hope they wind up with the national championship,"
Irish Coach Lou Holtz said. "But that's not in my control.";    Despite
Johnson's heroics, there was one final bit of fodder thrown to the voters as
the game neared its end. With 43 seconds remaining, Notre Dame junior Raghib
"Rocket" Ismail returned a punt 91 yards for an apparent touchdown. Halfway
through his incredible run, teammate Greg Davis was flagged for clipping Tim
James. The score was nullified.;    Davis said, "I don't think I clipped him."
Although James said he "thought I had a play on it," it may have been as big a
break for Colorado as the one Oct. 6.;    "The return by Rocket Ismail was one
of the greatest individual efforts I've seen," Holtz said. "I don't know if
the clip had anything to do with the return, but I certainly hope it did.";   
It was one of many costly mistakes for the Irish. In the first half, an
extra-point try was blocked and they missed two field-goal attempts. They
committed three turnovers in a four-play span early in the second half, after
Johnson led the Buffaloes to their go-ahead score.;    That was Notre Dame's
biggest mistake: not capitalizing on the departure of Hagan. He was sandwiched
between two Irish tacklers and suffered a ruptured tendon in his left knee
with a minute remaining in the first half. The junior will undergo surgery
today in Colorado.;    Johnson started the second half for the Buffs, and a
third-quarter field goal by Craig Hentrich gave Notre Dame a 9-3 lead. Notre
Dame had blown open last year's game at the start of the second half, but
Johnson helped avoid a repeat of that.;    Colorado had to punt on his first
series of downs, but the Irish fumbled their subsequent play and the Buffaloes
took over at Notre Dame's 40. Johnson led them to a first-and-goal at the 4,
and Eric Bieniemy scored from a yard out on third down. Jim Harper's
point-after made it 10-9.;    "My stomach hasn't settled down yet," Johnson
said immediately after the game. "Hagan told me he had a vision during
practice earlier in the week that I would have to come in. That was strange.";
   One could not help but watch the sideline down marker closely during the
decisive drive. Because of a referee's error, Colorado was allowed five downs
in the game at Missouri. On the fifth down, Johnson scored a TD to give
Colorado a 33-31 victory on the game's final play.;    It cannot be assumed
that Colorado would have lost under proper conditions, because Johnson would
not have spiked the ball on what was believed to be third down (and actually
fourth). Still, it has been an issue that has lingered for months.;    "We
said then, no more partying," said Colorado tackle Mark Vander Poel. "It was
time to play together as a team. It was time to stop playing as individuals.";
