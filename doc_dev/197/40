<TEXT>     Official announcements won't be made until Sunday. But Athletic Director
Bob Bockrath said Monday that the Bears' likely options have been narrowed to
the Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando on Jan. 1 and the Blockbuster Bowl in Miami
on Dec. 28.;   Those choices became apparent after Bockrath received bad news
from Fiesta and Sugar bowl representatives.;   The Fiesta Bowl told Bockrath
on Sunday morning that it was unable to move its starting time to avoid a
conflict with the 2 p.m. Rose Bowl, thus blocking Cal's chance to accept a
bid. The Pacific 10 Conference won't permit its teams to appear in a game that
conflicts with the Rose, where unbeaten Washington seems to be headed, and NBC
wouldn't swap the Fiesta's starting time with that of the Hall of Fame Bowl.; 
 Bockrath said he was informed Monday by Sugar Bowl executive director Mickey
Holmes that "the odds-on-favorite is still Notre Dame" to play the
Southeastern Conference champion, probably Florida.;   "My concern is that we
don't have a long tradition of bowl history to draw from," said Bockrath,
whose Golden Bears are 3-6-1 in bowls in the past 70 years. "Some bowls aren't
willing to take a chance on us. If it was all based on records, it would be
simpler.";   No. 8 Penn State and No. 12 Notre Dame, who have two losses each
and play each other Saturday, have more lucrative options than Cal, the
Pac-10's second-place team. Even if Penn State loses Saturday, it is likely to
play Tennessee in the Fiesta. And even if the Irish lose Saturday, they are
likely to play the Gators in the Sugar Bowl.;   Cal's best bet might be to
play the Atlantic Coast Conference champion, probably No. 15 Clemson (6-1-1),
in the Florida Citrus on Jan 1. In addition to its New Year's Day date, the
Florida Citrus is attractive to teams because Orlando is a tourism city and
the home of Disney World. The Citrus last year paid $1.35 million each to
Nebraska and Georgia Tech.;   Although the Blockbuster Bowl isn't played on
Jan. 1, Bockrath said the Dec. 28 game interests him because of its $1.8
million per-team payout, its lack of competition from other bowls and
prime-time television exposure (CBS).;   The Blockbuster also is interested in
the Florida State-Miami loser.;   Bockrath received a box of chilies from
executive director Cricket Musch of the Dec. 31 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas,
but Bockrath said, "They're third, and they know that.";   Meanwhile, Sun Bowl
officials were trying to work a deal with the Pac-10, Big Eight and Big Ten to
attract two of their third-place teams.;   Stanford and UCLA are tied for
third in the Pac-10. The Sun Bowl guarantees $1 million for each participant,
$400,000 more than the Dec. 30 Freedom Bowl, the Anaheim-based game that also
is pursuing Stanford.  </TEXT>
