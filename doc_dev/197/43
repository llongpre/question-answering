The plot calls for one of football's most respected coaches to earn his 200th 
career victory by beating a school that has twice denied him the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Reviews are mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up, said Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, who will try for No. 200 
Saturday against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs down, Hurricanes Coach Dennis Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't get it this game, I'm sure he'll get it some other game," 
Erickson said. "I'd prefer he wait a week or two." 
</P>
<P>
The game didn't need the anticipation of a Bowden milestone to sell out the 
Orange Bowl. With Florida State (4-0) ranked second and Miami (2-1) ranked 
ninth, the hype would have been high anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But the Seminoles say the chance to give Bowden No. 200 against his chief 
tormentor is tantalizing. 
</P>
<P>
Bowden, 60, is 6-10 against Miami; he's 193-62-3 against all other teams. 
Losses to the Hurricanes cost him a No. 1 finish in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of reaching 200 against anybody are long. Ten major college coaches 
have done it, and only one is active -- Penn State's Joe Paterno, who has 221 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of beating the Hurricanes are long, too. They have won 33 in a row in 
the Orange Bowl. They haven't lost two games in one season since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern is stopping them," Bowden said. "They can get 50 points as 
easily as they can get 25. It's a game of inches when you play them -- you miss 
one inch, and they put it in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
A Florida State victory would strengthen its bid for a national title and move 
the Seminoles into first place should top-ranked Notre Dame slip at home 
against Stanford. The Cardinal gave the Irish (3-0) a tough game last year 
before losing 27-17 and played 12th-ranked Colorado tough in its season-opener, 
losing 21-17. 
</P>
<P>
A loss probably would drop Florida State several spots in the rankings. No. 3 
Michigan figures to have little trouble at Wisconsin and No. 4 Auburn should 
roll at home against Louisiana Tech. No 5 Virginia and No. 6 Tennessee are 
idle. 
</P>
<P>
Other games involving Top Ten teams have No. 7 Oklahoma at Oklahoma State, No. 
8 Nebraska at Kansas State and No. 10 Florida at home against Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets you hyped up," Stacey Satterwhite, an Oklahoma State defensive tackle, 
said of the game against the Cowboys' arch-rival, Oklahoma.
