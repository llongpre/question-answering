THE DEBATE CONTINUES: IS MIAMI, NOTRE DAME OR SAN DIEGO ST. NO. 1?

What was Mike Downey smoking the day Notre Dame played Miami? 
</P>
<P>
He obviously wasn't watching his "No. 1" team get kicked. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Irish should be "fighting mad," but not because they were outvoted 
in the polls -- rather, because they were duped into believing they were even 
playing for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Downey blames a second-rate selection system when the fault lies in some 
third-rate bowl game matchups: How the loser of the Notre Dame-Miami game ends 
up playing the No. 1 team in the Orange Bowl; the loser of the Alabama-Auburn 
game ends up playing No. 2 team in the Sugar Bowl; and the country's hottest 
team (Florida State) doesn't even get a shot at Notre Dame, Auburn or Miami is 
a mystery.
