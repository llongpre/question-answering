<LEADPARA>  YOU can understand why Chuck Rohe is feeling just a lit-tle bit sensitive
these days. He is the executive director of the Florida Citrus Bowl in
Orlando, which is known around here as the Second Choice Bowl.;   A nice
second choice, to be sure. But still a second choice. When the Cal football
team accepts a Citrus Bowl bid today to meet Clemson on New Year's Day -- it's
a done deal, trust us -- Rohe knows that those Cal alums in funny blue caps
will continue to believe their Golden Bears deserve to be playing in the Sugar
Bowl instead.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     You know, the Sugar Bowl. New Orleans. More prestige, more tradition, more
saxophones, more staggering drunks.;   "The only thing I'll say about that,"
Rohe said Saturday, "is that in four of the last six years, our Citrus Bowl
television ratings have beat out the Sugar Bowl. Now, one reason is that they
were going up against the Orange Bowl most of the time, but it's still a valid
ratings number.;   "As far as tradition goes," Rohe continued, "we've been
sold out 11 years in a row. And last year, we had the national champion come
out of our game.";   Well, to be totally accurate, it was only half a national
champion: Georgia Tech, which shared the title with Colorado when each one
finished No. 1 in separate wire-service polls. And the only reason Georgia
Tech played in Orlando was that as the Atlantic Coast Conference champion, the
school was contractually obligated to appear there, as Clemson is this
season.;   But hey, you can't blame Rohe for trying to put a good spin on the
Citrus Bowl picture. That is his job. Will the Cal fans and players buy it? He
hopes so.;   After Saturday's 25-6 victory over Arizona State, the Bears have
a 9-1 record and will hold onto their No. 6 national ranking. Yet the Sugar
Bowl people passed over Cal and selected Notre Dame -- which was ranked No. 12
last week and will fall even farther after Saturday's loss to Penn State. That
gave the Irish an 8-3 record and gave Cal much cause to gloat.;   "How'd Notre
Dame do today?" Cal Coach Bruce Snyder asked mischievously in the locker
room.;   "Lost by 22 points," someone told him.;   "Jeez, too bad," said
Snyder, shaking his head in mock sympathy.;   Mike Pawlawski, the blunt Cal
quarterback, was even more blunt.;   "Notre Dame lost, huh?" Pawlawski asked.
"I love it. Sugar Bowl heroes, huh? I'm going to Disney World . . . You know,
I don't understand how people, writers or fans or whoever, can talk about a
'bad bowl game.' To me, they're all good.";   Technically, of course, no bowl
can make any "selection" until today. But despite an alleged rule that
prevents games from making early picks, every bowl committee cut a deal of
some sort last week. That is why Rohe and another Citrus Bowl scout, Elmer
Cook, were standing outside the Cal locker room Saturday, handing out lapel
stickers. No scouts from any other bowls were even at the stadium.;   So you
can expect the obvious today: The Berkeley Bears are headed for the Country
Bear Jamboree at the Magic Kingdom. Not to mention the gauntlet of other
Orlando theme parks. There are many worse ways to spend a holiday break.;   "I
think the team will be thrilled to get the (Citrus) bid," Snyder said. "If
somebody had told me a few years ago we were going to be playing on a New
Year's Day with a team that had nine wins . . .";   That's a point worth
stressing over and over again, to all hands involved. The Cal football team
has come a long way in two seasons, and deserves to bask in whatever limelight
it can, but let's face facts. Bowls love teams that draw huge television
ratings and/or send planeloads of alumni who come to town and spend money by
the barrel.;   Cal is not yet in that class. Those who wonder why only had to
stop by Memorial Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The place was only two-thirds
full, even though this is the best Cal team in 30 years -- and the last home
game for the senior class that made it so. Major bowl teams draw capacity
crowds to their home games, not 46,000 people in a 76,000-seat stadium.;  
Rohe and his Citrus Bowl, however, are still delighted to have Cal. It gives
the game a top 10 team to brag about, plus it should help pick up a few TV
ratings points for ABC on the West Coast. The Citrus people don't have to
worry about selling tickets to Cal fans. Clemson's campus is less than a day's
drive away from Orlando, and Clemson maniacs should snarf up whatever's left
of the 11,000 seats that will be allocated to Cal.;   "I hope we'll sell all
of them to Cal fans," Rohe said. "If not, I know the Clemson people will buy
them. But I just don't think that when all is said and done, the Cal people
will regret coming to our game.";   Even if, instead of Bourbon Street and
jazz, the Bears will now get Donald Duck and the great squeeze-off.;   That's
right, the great squeeze-off. Cal fans, make sure to set your VCRs for this
one.;   "We do that at Disney World when the two participating teams go
there," Rohe explained. "Each of the teams picks three players. One guy slices
up oranges, one guy squeezes them, and one guy pours the juice into a pitcher.
They race against each other for five minutes and see who squeezes the most
juice. It gets pretty sloppy.";   They can ship the dregs by Federal Express
to Notre Dame.  </TEXT>
