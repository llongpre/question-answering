<TEXT>     The sixth-ranked Bears (9-1) will play Atlantic Coast Conference champion
Clemson (7-1-1).;   Cal settled for the Florida Citrus after the New
Orleans-based Sugar Bowl chose No. 17 Notre Dame (8-3) instead of the Bears or
No. 7 Penn State (9-2) to face Southeastern Conference champion Florida. In
the past two weeks, Notre Dame has lost twice and fallen 12 spots in the
Associated Press poll.;   "I think we're going to Orlando to have a good time,
win or lose," tight end Brent Woodall said. "I think the only one that's going
to lose out is the Sugar Bowl, bringing a team like Notre Dame that doesn't
fulfill their expectations on the field. I'm sure they're going to get great
media coverage because it's Notre Dame. But the Sugar Bowl is the only one
that's going to lose out.;   "I think it's a great situation. I would've had a
good time in New Orleans. I'm going to have a good time in Orlando.";   The
Bears will receive $1.35 million, $2.2 million less than the Sugar Bowl's
payout.;   Cal Athletic Director Bob Bockrath said he never felt comfortable
about the Sugar Bowl's early interest. The Florida Citrus, which scouted Cal
since its fifth game, closely monitored the Sugar Bowl's interest in Notre
Dame.;   "They wanted Notre Dame -- everyone wanted them," Florida Citrus
scout Elmer Cook said. "They wanted to make a deal with the Penn State-Notre
Dame winner. Notre Dame would never make that deal. (Notre Dame) said, 'Take
us one way or the other.' ";   When it was apparent Notre Dame was headed to
the Sugar Bowl after its 35-34 loss to Tennessee on Nov. 9, "we got to the
point last Monday that if we would offer a bid to Cal, they would accept it,"
Cook said. "We thought Cal was out of (the Sugar Bowl's) picture.";   Sugar
Bowl officials couldn't be reached for comment.;   Cal Coach Bruce Snyder
addressed the impact of Cal's Jan. 1 appearance.;   "We have to put on a good
performance, and we have to travel well from our support groups," he said.;  
The Bears sold 7,000 tickets to last year's Copper Bowl in Tucson, Ariz.  </TEXT>
