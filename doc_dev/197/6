<TEXT>     "To me, that was a farce," he said Sunday after the Hurricanes accepted a
bid from the Orange Bowl.;   "The bowl matchups were made I don't know how
long ago.";   Of course, nothing was supposed to be decided until noon PST
Sunday. Bowls are subject to a $250,000 fine for breaking the deadline, but no
fines have been announced.;   The bowl selections have left some schools
disappointed and frustrated.;   No. 17 Notre Dame, despite a two-game losing
streak, will play No. 5 Florida in the Sugar Bowl.;   After Saturday's 35-13
victory over Notre Dame, several Penn State players were bitter that the bowl
deadline was broken to their detriment.;   "We thought that we should have
gone to the Sugar Bowl," wide receiver O.J. McDuffie said. "But if it's the
Fiesta, we're happy. We wanted a New Year's Day bowl game and got one. We're
satisfied.";   Cal also felt squeezed out of the Sugar Bowl picture.;   "I
think the only thing that is being hurt by that is the Sugar Bowl," said Cal
senior tight end Brent Woodall.;   "They are taking a team with a lesser
record. If they wanted to have the best game possible, they would have taken
the team with the highest ranking, and that's us.";   Cotton Bowl president
John Stuart said, "There's no perfect system -- you've got to start with that.
It's going to take a while to work all the kinks out.;   "From the fans'
standpoint, I hope it's going to get better.";   Next year things will change
as the bowl alliance begins. The Orange, Cotton, Sugar, Fiesta and Citrus have
aligned with five conferences and Notre Dame to divide the spots. The Rose
Bowl, which has not produced an undisputed national champion since Southern
Cal in 1972, is tied to the Big Ten and the Pacific 10.;   Which of the
consortium's five bowls hosts the best game is determined by the rankings of
the champions of the Southwest, Southeastern and Big Eight Conferences. The
bowl connected with the highest-ranked champion -- the Sugar has the
Southeastern, the Cotton has the Southwest, and the Orange has the Big Eight
-- picks first from among the at-large teams. If the highest-ranked matchup is
among the at-large teams, then the Fiesta would host the premier game.;   But
even this solution won't solve all the problems.;   There would be nothing to
prevent the Sugar Bowl from selecting based on television ratings instead of
national rankings again, as it did this year by working out a deal with Notre
Dame instead of a higher-ranked team.;   "That's one of those items we'll just
have to feel out," Stuart said. "I think it happened this season for one
reason and one reason only -- they had to turn on TV sets. . . . I just see
the chances of stability as much greater."; BOWL GAMES AT A GLANCE; Bowl/
