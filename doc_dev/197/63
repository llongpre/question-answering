<TEXT>     Tepper, who will coach the Illini against UCLA in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 31,
said he does not expect to lose any assistant coaches before then. He expects
to compete with Mackovic for some of them later.;   Tepper learned about a
week ago that Mackovic was seriously considering a move to Texas, and said he
thought he would be the prime candidate though "nobody promised me the job."; 
 Chancellor Morton Weir said Tepper would get a three-year contract, but
financial details had not been worked out.; BLOCKBUSTER OFFER: The Blockbuster
Bowl, still in its infancy, is trying to muscle in on football's traditional
New Year's games by offering millions of dollars to win commitments from the
Big East and Atlantic Coast conferences.;   A representative of the bowl said
the conferences have been offered major financial payoffs if they sign
long-term agreements to play in the Miami-based game.;   Such a contract,
however, could jeopardize a proposed alliance among the Sugar, Orange, Cotton
and Fiesta bowls.;   The alliance would commit the Big East champion, the ACC
champion and Notre Dame to the four-bowl arrangement, along with the champions
of the Southeastern Conference, the Big Eight and Southwest Conference, plus
two at-large teams.;   John Paquette, a spokesman for the Big East, said
conference officials felt obligated to present the offer to the athletic
directors of the member schools.;   The Boston Globe reported the Blockbuster
Bowl was offering $4.3 million per team.; NOTRE DAME DEPARTURE? Rumors were
rampant that Notre Dame defensive coordinator Gary Darnell was under pressure
to leave even as the Irish prepared for their Sugar Bowl game against
Florida.;   Darnell said he was in contact with Northwestern, which is seeking
a new coach, and said he is good friends with Texas Coach John Mackovic, who
is looking for assistants.;   The Irish defense suffered through one of its
worst seasons ever under Darnell.  </TEXT>
