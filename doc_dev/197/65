FRANCESA STIRS FIFTH-DOWN DEBATE AGAIN

Like a nagging cold or a persistent salesman, the fifth-down controversy just 
won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar over Colorado's disputed 33-31 victory over Missouri started to fade 
a few weeks after the Oct. 6 game. But CBS commentator Mike Francesa is 
stirring it up again. 
</P>
<P>
Francesa, one of 60 voters in the Associated Press college football poll, is 
troubled by the fact that Colorado scored the winning touchdown on what proved 
to be an illegal extra down. So troubled that the second-ranked Buffaloes might 
not get his vote as national champion even if they beat No. 1 Notre Dame in the 
Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a close situation, that (fifth-down) game could be a factor," Francesa 
says. 
</P>
<P>
And what's a close situation? Francesa says that if Colorado barely beats Notre 
Dame and third-ranked Miami or No. 4 Georgia Tech rout their bowl opponents, he 
might vote the Hurricanes or Yellow Jackets No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Think about it," Francesa says. "If that happens, you'd be talking about an 
unbeaten Tech team vs. a Colorado team with one loss, one tie and one shadowy 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Francesa recently infuriated Colorado fans by making similar remarks on a 
Denver radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to win any popularity contests out here," says Dave Plati, the 
school's sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
Like other Colorado defenders, Plati points out that the Buffaloes 
intentionally spiked the ball on the next-to-last play because they thought it 
was third down. It actually was the fourth down, but a mixup by the officials 
gave Colorado another play, which turned out to be the winning 1-yard sneak by 
Charles Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Plati says the Buffaloes wouldn't have spiked the ball had they known it was 
the fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't he (Francesa) know the facts?" Plati says. "Why should we be punished 
for playing under the guidelines we were given? People think we're the villain 
because they think we cheated. And that's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
Francesa considers the victory tainted even though it was upheld by the Big 
Eight. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his reservations about the fifth-down game, Francesa says he would vote 
the Buffaloes No. 1 if they win impressively on New Year's Day and no other 
team makes a convincing case for the national championship.
