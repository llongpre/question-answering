Through the wizardry of videotape and the absent-mindedness of Lou Holtz, a 
sometimes scathing pep talk meant only for the ears of Notre Dame players 
became the center of attention Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the viewers of Denver-based KCNC-TV were treated to the footage late 
Thursday evening, but it wasn't until Friday morning that transcripts of 
Holtz's impromptu speech, made shortly before a Thursday afternoon practice 
session, were circulated among the assembled Orange Bowl media and, of course, 
distributed to an irate University of Colorado football team. 
</P>
<P>
According to the videotape transcript, Holtz intimated that comments attributed 
to Notre Dame players, specifically quarterback Tony Rice, were being twisted 
and tailored to fit the motivational needs of the Colorado team. Holtz also 
suggested that this wasn't the first time a Colorado opponent's quotes had been 
used to the Buffaloes' advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you what. . . . They've been living a lie," Holtz told his players 
Thursday. "They've been living a lie all year. Remember I told you . . . The 
coaches had problems withIllinois. They're over there telling 'em you guys say 
this, you saying that. That's fine. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't be any more (sky) high than what they're going to be. But we just 
have to make sure we take care of our football team. They're expecting an 
outstanding football team and they're going to see one. They're going to see 
the best Notre Dame (unintelligible) . . . And we're going to whip 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz didn't stop there. In a departure from his public stance, he told his 
team that a victory over Colorado Monday night would guarantee the Irish a 
second consecutive national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"The bad of it is Colorado feels they're being slighted," he said that day. 
"They're going to be sky high and they don't get any respect and all that other 
nonsense. The good thing is, it sends a message to everybody who votes that 
after we win the football game, they can't do anything else but put Notre Dame 
No. 1. They can't, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz then listed the reasons why a Notre Dame victory was so plausible. 
</P>
<P>
"Number one, (Colorado is) used to scoring a lot of points," he said. "They 
ain't playing any Kansas State. We got to be patient on defense, just play our 
football game. On offense, we want to control the football. All we want (is) a 
first down, first down, first down. Frustration will set in on Colorado's 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"By the middle of the third quarter, they will leave the game plan completely 
and start grab-bagging. Remember me telling you that. They are not patient. 
(Their) quarterback will want to make plays and we aren't going to let him. 
Stop the bomb, control the quarterback. Those are two critical things along 
with the five areas we told you." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Holtz began the process of damage control. He said he was unaware of 
the TV crew's presence at the workout, which was open to the media for 15 
minutes, and that his earlier comments weren't intended to demean the Colorado 
coaching staff or team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do anything where it would hurt or be derogatory to Colorado, 
and if that's the way it's interpreted, I sincerely apologize, because that 
wasn't the intention," he said. "The intention was to make our players aware of 
the various things that were being said and also to put their minds at ease 
that we could win the football game." 
</P>
<P>
He also said several of his remarks have been taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't in reference to Colorado lies, or anything else along that line," 
Holtz said. "But sometimes things are said or put in the paper that really 
aren't accurate along that line. I just wanted our players to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz was referring to a midweek quote attributed to Rice in which the Notre 
Dame quarterback allegedly said that his team wanted to get another win under 
its belt, as if to imply that Colorado posed little challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"An out and out lie. (Rice) didn't say that," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
At an Orange Bowl Hall of Fame luncheon earlier in the day, Holtz explained his 
pep-talk comments to Colorado Coach Bill McCartney. Asked later if he would 
share the conversation with reporters, Holtz said, "I assumed it was taped." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it wasn't a banner day for Holtz. At that same luncheon, Holtz 
mistakenly told an audience of about 1,400 Orange Bowl supporters that Colorado 
was quarterbacked by Sal Aunese. 
</P>
<P>
Prodded by master of ceremonies Bob Griese to list several Notre Dame 
negatives, McCartney knew just where to start. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, they don't know who our quarterback is," he said. "Our 
quarterback is not Sal Aunese, he's dead. Our quarterback is Darian Hagan. 
They're in trouble right there because they're going to think we only have 10 
guys on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Aunese died earlier this fall after a bout with stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
It clearly wasn't Holtz's finest moment. Nor have these been his finest 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot more problems today than I did yesterday," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
No one disagreed.
