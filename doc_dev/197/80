<TEXT>     When he finally got a chance, Thomas leaped and blocked the kick with his
left elbow. The ball rolled out of bounds as time expired.;   Colorado (5-2-1)
and Nebraska (6-1-1) are both 3-0-1 in the Big Eight Conference. If the teams
tie for the conference title, the Orange Bowl will decide which team will go
to the Jan. 1 game.; IOWA 16, OHIO STATE 9: Matt Rodgers ran for one touchdown
and passed for another to lead the 11th-ranked Hawkeyes (7-1, 4-1) to a Big
Ten Conference victory over the 13th-ranked Buckeyes (6-2, 3-2) in Columbus,
Ohio.;   Iowa's players wore all-black helmets in memory of three Iowa
professors and a graduate student shot to death Friday by another graduate
student, who later killed himself. All the emblems, including the Tiger Hawk
and American flag, were removed from the helmets.;   The football team already
was in Columbus when the shooting occurred, and the decision was made to
proceed with the game. A moment of silence was observed before the game.;  
"That tragedy back in Iowa City is so sad that I know it had a big part of us
winning, because I think our guys just gave that 20 percent extra effort,"
Iowa Coach Hayden Fry said.;   Rodgers completed 20 of 27 passes for 258 yards
before leaving the game with a sprained ankle late in the third quarter.;  
Ohio State, which came in averaging 255 yards rushing, was limited to 124
yards on the ground and 97 passing.;   It was only Iowa's second road win over
Ohio State since 1960. The game was played before 95,357, the largest crowd
ever at expanded Ohio Stadium.; MICHIGAN 42, PURDUE 0: Desmond Howard had 169
all-purpose yards, scored two touchdowns and tied two NCAA records as the
fourth-ranked Wolverines (7-1, 5-0) routed the Boilermakers (3-5, 5-2) in a
Big Ten game in Ann Arbor, Mich.;   Howard has caught TD passes in eight
consecutive games this season, tying the single-season record set by Auburn's
Terry Beasley in 1971. Howard also has caught TD passes in 10 consecutive
regular-season games, tying the record set by BYU's Mike Chronister in
1976-77.;   Elvis Grbac's two touchdown passes gave him 22 for the season,
breaking his school record of 21 set last year.; NOTRE DAME 38, NAVY 0: Rick
Mirer set a Notre Dame record for touchdown passes, throwing for three scores
and a career-best 303 yards as the No. 5 Irish (8-1) crushed the Midshipmen
(0-8) in South Bend, Ind.;   Mirer's 17th TD pass of the season broke the
school mark set by Bob Williams in 1949 and tied by John Huarte in 1964 and
Joe Theismann in 1970.;   Navy, which lost for the 28th consecutive time to
the Irish, matched its worst-ever start of 1948, when the Midshipmen went
0-8-1 before winning.; OKLAHOMA 28, KANSAS STATE 7: Mike Gaddis ran for 191
yards and three touchdowns to lead the 20th-ranked Sooners (6-2, 3-1) to a Big
Eight Conference victory over the Wildcats (4-4, 1-3) in Norman, Okla.; OTHER
GAMES: Linebacker Julyon Brown grabbed an errant snap on a punt in the end
zone for a second-quarter touchdown, giving Illinois (5-3, 2-2) the lead for
good in a 22-6 Big Ten victory over Wisconsin (3-5, 0-5) in Champaign, Ill. .
