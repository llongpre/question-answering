Gerry Faust applauded Lou Holtz, his successor as Notre Dame coach, after the 
top-ranked Fighting Irish claimed the national championship with a Fiesta Bowl 
victory over West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really happy for the kids and Notre Dame and for Lou," Faust said after 
the Irish won, 34-21, Monday night in Tempe, Ariz. "Lou did a heck of a job and 
did very well. I was really happy for them."

<P>
Faust, who had a 30-26-1 record as Notre Dame coach from 1981 to 1985, said "it 
would have been great" to have won a national championship for the Irish and 
join former Irish coaches Dan Devine, Ara Parseghian, Knute Rockne and Frank 
Leahy.
