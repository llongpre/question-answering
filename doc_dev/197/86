Today's an especially big day for football bowl games, but what about those who 
love a parade? 
</P>
<P>
At 8 a.m., the TV networks and local stations both will serve up live coverage 
of the 100th "Tournament of Roses Parade" from Pasadena. The grand marshal is 
Shirley Temple Black, who also presided over the event 50 years ago in 1939 
when she was a child star. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will be shown on CBS (where the hosts will be Patrick Duffy and Joan 
Van Ark); NBC (Alex Trebek and Phylicia Rashad); ABC (Jim McKay and Joan 
Lunden); KTLA Channel 5 (Bob Eubanks and Stephanie Edwards); KTTV Channel 11 (a 
3-D telecast with Bill Welsh and Mary Hart) and KMEX Channel 34 (Jessi Losada 
and Maria Elena Salinas). 
</P>
<P>
There are also chances to catch the parade later in the day on repeat 
telecasts: at 10:30 a.m. (5)(11), at 6 p.m. (11) and at 7:30 p.m. (5). 
</P>
<P>
Dallas also boasts a New Year's Parade, and CBS will be there to cover the 32nd 
annual "Cotton Bowl Parade" from 2-3 p.m. (2)(8).
