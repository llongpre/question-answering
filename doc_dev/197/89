   The Fiesta Bowl will move to San Diego's Jack
Murphy Stadium if the participating teams object to playing in
Arizona, the chairman of the selection committee said Saturday
night.
   Don Meyers told The Associated Press that if the game has to be
moved because of the reaction over Arizona voters rejecting Martin
Luther King's birthday as a state holiday, it will be played Jan. 1
in San Diego, three days after the Holiday Bowl in the same
stadium.
   ``We've struck a deal with Jack Murphy Stadium,'' Meyers said.
   ``We feel we've got a shot at (top-ranked) Notre Dame and we
should know by noon, Eastern time, on Sunday,'' Meyers said. On
Nov. 24, the day the NCAA permits official bowl bids, ``we plan to
extend an invitation to the University of Virginia and we're not
aware of any reason for them to turn it down. We will also invite
either Notre Dame or the highest-ranked Southeastern Conference
team that doesn't go to the Sugar Bowl.''
   Arizona has been stung by national criticism since Tuesday, when
voters rejected by a 51-49 margin a referendum which would have
created a paid state holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King
Jr.
   On Wednesday, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would
recommend the 1993 Super Bowl be moved from the Phoenix area
because of the defeat of the King holiday. Gov. Rose Mofford
estimated that losing the Super Bowl would cost Arizona $200
million in lost revenue.
   Meyers said 11th-ranked Virginia was extended an invitation to
the Jan. 1 Fiesta Bowl after the team, known as the Cavaliers, beat
North Carolina 24-10 Saturday. An opponent has not been chosen, he
said.
   Jim Copeland, Virginia's athletic director, said it was
uncertain whether the Cavaliers would accept the bid.
   The Fiesta Bowl ``has been an option we've considered all along
but it's been a real difficulty working through that (the King
vote) and I'm not sure we've resolved it yet,'' Copeland said.
