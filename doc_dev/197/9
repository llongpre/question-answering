<LEADPARA>  Colorado, which overcame controversy, close calls and a crucial injury, won
its first national championship in college football today.;    The Buffaloes,
who edged Notre Dame 10-9 in the Orange Bowl, beat out Georgia Tech for the
No. 1 ranking in the final Associated Press poll of sports writers and
broadcasters.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Colorado (11-1-1) and Georgia Tech (11-0-1) were ranked 1-2 going into the
bowls, and they remained that way after the bowls. The Yellow Jackets beat
Nebraska 45-21 in the Citrus and finished as the only major unbeaten team, but
they couldn't overtake a Colorado squad that finished the season with 10
straight wins.;    "What a tremendous moment it is for our school, our kids,
the state of Colorado and the city of Boulder," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney
said.;    Colorado received 39 first-place votes and 1,475 points, while Tech
got 20 first-place votes and 1,441 points. The 34-point margin was the
fifth-closest since AP went to a permanent postseason poll in 1968.;    Miami,
which demolished Texas 46-3 in the Cotton Bowl, rose from fourth to third with
one-first-place vote and 1,388 points. The Hurricanes (10-2) fell just short
of becoming the first team in college football history to finish first or
second for five consecutive seasons.;    Florida State (10-2) jumped from
sixth to fourth after beating Penn State 24-17 in the Blockbuster Bowl, and
Washington (10-2) climbed from eighth to fifth following a 46-34 victory over
Iowa in the Rose Bowl.;    Notre Dame (9-3) fell from fifth to sixth. Rounding
out the Top 10 were Michigan (9-3), Tennessee (9-2-2), Clemson (10-2) and
Houston (10-1).;    Penn State finished 11th, followed by Texas, Florida,
Louisville, Texas A&amp;M, Michigan State, Oklahoma, Iowa, Auburn, Southern
California, Mississippi, Brigham Young, Virginia, Nebraska and Illinois.;   
Colorado is only the second team to win the national championship with a loss
and a tie since the AP started its poll in 1936. Alabama won the title after
the 1965 season with a 9-1-1 record. No team has been voted national champion
with two losses.;    The last time the only unbeaten team didn't win the
national title was 1982. Southern Methodist went 11-0-1 that season, but
finished second in the final poll behind 11-1 Penn State.;    The national
championship is the first for Colorado in any sport except skiing, where the
Buffaloes have collected 12 titles.;    When the Buffaloes got off to a 1-1-1
start, their chances of winning the title seemed remote. But they turned their
season around with consecutive wins over Texas and Washington and a
controversial fifth-down victory over Missouri. Those tough tests may have
helped prepare the Buffaloes for the Orange Bowl, where they overcame the loss
of starting quarterback Darian Hagan.  </TEXT>
