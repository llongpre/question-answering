<P>
Florida cracked the Top 10, Brigham Young dropped out of the elite group and 
Georgia Tech gained its first ranking in six years today in the Associated 
Press college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
Florida, which can't go to a bowl game because of NCAA violations, rose seven 
spots to No. 10 after beating Mississippi State 34-21 and improving its record 
to 4-0. It's the first Top 10 appearance for the Gators since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
BYU fell seven places to No. 11 after losing its first game of the season 32-16 
to Oregon. The victory boosted Oregon into the rankings at No. 22. 
</P>
<P>
USC's storm-shortened 35-26 victory over Ohio State lifted the Trojans three 
notches to 15th and dropped the Buckeyes five slots to 20th. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's 27-6 victory over South Carolina moved the undefeated Yellow 
Jackets up to 23rd in the nationwide poll of sports writers and broadcasters. 
Tech hadn't been ranked since 1984, when it got as high as 12th. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped South Carolina, which was 25th last week, out of the rankings. 
Arizona State, 21st last week, also fell out of the Top 25 after a 30-9 loss to 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame and Florida State remained 1-2 and combined to get all but one of 
the 60 first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish, who beat Purdue 37-11, received 49 first-place votes and 
1,489 points. Florida State got 10 first-place votes and 1,420 points after 
rallying to beat Virginia Tech 39-28. 
</P>
<P>
While the top two spots remained unchanged, there was movement elsewhere in the 
Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, which lost its opener to Notre Dame, jumped three spots to No. 3 
after downing Maryland 45-17. Virginia rose three places to No. 4 and gained 
one first-place vote following a 63-35 victory over William &amp; Mary. It is 
the highest ranking ever for the Cavaliers, who were never better than ninth 
prior to this season. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn and Tennessee both dropped after battling to a 26-26 tie. Auburn fell 
two places to No. 5 and Tennessee went down a notch to No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma jumped two spots to seventh after clipping Kansas 31-17, Nebraska 
stayed No. 8 after stopping Oregon State 31-7 and Miami rose one place to No. 9 
with a 48-21 win over Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado made the biggest jump, eight spots to No. 12, after handing Washington 
its first loss, 20-14. The Huskies fell five places to No. 17.
