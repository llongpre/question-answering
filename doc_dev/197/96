<LEADPARA>  Notre Dame didn't exactly recover successfully Saturday from the previous
week's emotional loss to Tennessee.;   But instead of suffering in obscurity
after losing 35-13 at Penn State, the Irish (8-3) will be accepting a Sugar
Bowl bid today.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Wide receiver O.J. McDuffie caught two touchdown passes and ran 37 yards on
a reverse for another TD as the eighth-ranked Nittany Lions (9-2) beat No. 12
Notre Dame in University Park, Pa.;   The Nittany Lions, headed to the Fiesta
Bowl to play Tennessee, still wonder why the Sugar Bowl didn't wait until
after Saturday's games to pick its teams.;   "We definitely took it as an
insult," McDuffie said. "They got beat last week (35-34, after leading 31-7),
and we felt they would try to maneuver into a bowl. We thought that we should
have gone to the Sugar Bowl. But if it's the Fiesta, we're happy. We wanted a
New Year's Day bowl game and got one.";   Tony Sacca became Penn State's
season passing-yardage leader with 2,326.; SYRACUSE 38, BOSTON COLLEGE 16:
Antonio Johnson caught a 55-yard touchdown pass just before halftime and then
picked up a teammate's fumble and sprinted 63 yards for another touchdown as
the 17th-ranked Orangemen (8-2) defeated the Eagles (4-6) in Boston.; OTHER
GAMES: Arlen Smith rushed for 116 yards and one touchdown, and Myreon Williams
scored on a 24-yard run as Army (4-6) won 19-0 over Akron (4-6) in West Point,
N.Y. . . . Tom Tarver threw for a career-high 311 yards and three touchdowns
for Rutgers (6-5) in a 41-0 victory over Temple (2-8) in Piscataway, N.J. . .
. Princeton (8-1, 5-1) was a 22-16 winner over Yale (5-4, 3-3) as Keith Ellis
rushed for 142 yards in Princeton, N.J., and Dartmouth (6-2-1, 5-0-1) won
45-13 over Brown in Hanover, N.H., as Al Rosier rushed for 229 yards and four
touchdown, so the Tigers and Big Green will battle for the Ivy League title
Saturday.  </TEXT>
