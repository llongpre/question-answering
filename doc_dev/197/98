<LEADPARA>  Notre Dame's hopes for a national title were rear-ended Saturday in South
Bend, Ind.;   The fifth-ranked Irish (8-2) lost 35-34 to No. 13 Tennessee
(6-2) when walk-on kicker Rob Leonard, replacing the injured Craig Hentrich,
missed his first career field-goal try on the final play. The 27-yard attempt
deflected off defender Jeremy Lincoln's backside.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Whenever I go home, my mom teases me about my big butt," said Lincoln, a
senior defensive back. "Today, that big butt paid off for us.";   The loss
probably ended Notre Dame's hopes for a shootout for No. 1 against the Florida
State-Miami (Fla.) winner in the Fiesta Bowl.;   "This is the most difficult
loss I've ever been associated with," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said. "It's
the most disappointed I've ever been in my life.";   The Irish (8-2) led 31-7
late in the first half. Then Tennessee's Floyd Miley returned a blocked field
goal 85 yards for a touchdown 14 seconds before intermission.;   Tennessee
quarterback Andy Kelly threw for three TDs, the last to Aaron Hayden with 4
minutes, 3 seconds left. Notre Dame moved 66 yards to the Tennessee 9 to set
up a field-goal try. With Hentrich on the sideline with a leg injury, Leonard
got the call.;   "It felt good," Leonard said. "But then I heard the thump. I
looked up, and I realized it didn't have enough to get there.";   Lincoln, who
came in untouched from the left side, said: "I overran it, and I felt it hit
my rear end. It was the biggest play of my career, thanks to my behind.";
COLORADO 16, OKLAHOMA ST. 12: Robbie James' 20-yard touchdown pass to
Christian Fauria on a fake field goal with six seconds left gave the No. 14
Buffaloes (6-2-1, 4-0-1) a Big Eight Conference win over the Cowboys (0-8-1,
0-4-1) in Stillwater, Okla.;   Colorado trailed 12-10 at the time. A field
goal would have won the game.;   "That's the gutsiest call I've ever seen,"
Oklahoma State Coach Pat Jones said.;   Colorado Coach Bill McCartney
downplayed the call, saying if Fauria wasn't open or wasn't far enough
downfield for a first down, James would have thrown it away and the Buffaloes
would have kicked on fourth down.; MICHIGAN 59, NORTHWESTERN 14: In Ann Arbor,
Mich., Desmond Howard scored on the first play and finished with 201
all-purpose yards as the No. 4 Wolverines (8-1, 6-0) blasted the Wildcats
(3-6, 2-4) in a Big Ten Conference game.;   Howard caught a short pass and
turned it into a 64-yard touchdown play on Michigan's first snap. His 20th
touchdown of the season gave him 120 points, breaking the school record of 117
set by Tom Harmon in 1940.; IOWA 38, INDIANA 21: Jim Hartlieb, making his
first start, threw two touchdown passes and Mike Saunders tied a school record
with four touchdowns as the No. 10 Hawkeyes (8-1, 5-1) beat the No. 25
Hoosiers (5-3-1, 4-2) in a Big Ten game in Iowa City.;   Saunders ran for
three TDs and caught a scoring pass from Hartlieb, who started in place of the
injured Matt Rodgers.; NEBRASKA 59, KANSAS 23: Redshirt freshman Calvin Jones
replaced the injured Derek Brown in the first quarter and ran for school
records of 294 yards and six touchdowns as the No. 11 Cornhuskers (7-1-1,
4-0-1) rallied from a 17-0 deficit to beat the Jayhawks (5-4, 2-3) in a Big
Eight game in Lawrence, Kan.; OTHER GAMES: In Minneapolis, No. 19 Ohio State
(7-2, 4-2) held an opponent under 20 points for the ninth game in a row in
winning 35-6 over Minnesota (2-7, 1-5) in a Big Ten game. Ohio State has
allowed only six touchdowns in six Big Ten games. . . . Mike Gaddis ran for
217 yards and four touchdowns as No. 20 Oklahoma (7-2, 4-1) gouged Missouri
(3-5-1, 1-4) for 428 rushing yards in a 56-16 Big Eight romp in Columbia, Mo.
Missouri entered the game with the worst run defense in Division I-A. . . .
Jason Verduzco completed passes to 10 different receivers in the first half as
Illinois (6-3, 4-2) rolled to a 41-14 Big Ten victory over Purdue (3-6, 2-4)
in West Lafayette, Ind. Verduzco finished 20 of 25 for 255 yards. . . . In
Ames, Iowa, Paul Watson threw three touchdown passes to Michael Smith and ran
for another as Kansas State (5-4, 2-3) won 37-7 over Iowa State (3-5-1,

Madison, Wis., and extended the Badgers' Big Ten losing streak to 19 games.  </TEXT>
