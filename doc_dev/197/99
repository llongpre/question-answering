The Broncos, who have some idea of what it feels like to lose a championship 
football game, are offering some advice to the University of Colorado 
Buffaloes, who Monday lost the Orange Bowl and their claim to the national 
college football title. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep your heads up," said Broncos running back Steve Sewell. And tight end 
Orson Mobley said the Buffs should "keep a winning attitude. Set your goals a 
little higher and try to achieve them." 
</P>
<P>
The Buffs were ranked No. 1 in the nation before Monday night's 21-6 loss to 
Notre Dame. They finished the season ranked No. 4 in the nation; Notre Dame 
finished No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The game could have handed the Buffs, 11-0 and the only undefeated major 
college team going into the game, their first-ever national championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos lost consecutive Super Bowls in 1987 and 1988, and the NFL team 
players and coaches said they saw a little of themselves in the Buffs' game 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a couple of games we had played," Broncos Coach Dan Reeves 
said. "You have a chance to do something in the first half, then you don't take 
advantage of opportunities and it comes back to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
Mobley recalled missing some chances and regretting it. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminded me a little of our game against the (New York) Giants. The first 
half belonged to us, but we missed some key scoring opportunities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sewell said he also knows what it is like. "It's a big letdown. But the younger 
guys have a chance to come back. Now they know what it's like to win, and that 
should give them some incentive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos agreed that the Buffs easily could be in a national title game 
again next year if they do not let Monday's loss affect them too much. 
</P>
<P>
And that is not likely to happen, the Broncos agreed. 
</P>
<P>
'They showed a lot of heart and a lot of class. That stands tall when all is 
said and done," said Broncos quarterback Gary Kubiak.
