<LEADPARA>  The death toll from the eruption of Mount Unzen rose to at least 28 today, and
a California geologist who narrowly escaped death on Mount St. Helens in 1980
was among 31 others missing.;    Soldiers in firefighting gear ventured into
the shadow of a suddenly ferocious volcano, recovering four bodies and
sighting 24 more before being turned back by searing gas, ash and rock.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Harry Glicken, 33, a researcher at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, was believed to have been near the town of Kamikoba to study the
volcano. French vulcanologists Maurice and Katia Kraft also were among the
missing.;    Officials said the three had been making daily appearances at a
site near the mountain that erupted on a far smaller scale on Nov. 17 for the
first time in 198 years, then again on Feb. 12 and May 24.;    Victims with
severe burns and clothes in shreds were taken to nearby hospitals after the
volcano began sending torrents of molten ash, gas and rock down a valley
Monday.;    The liquid fire set dozens of homes ablaze in the mountainside
town of Kamikoba, scorching everything in its path. Authorities evacuated
about 5,000 people.;    Officials said 20 people were injured, 15 of them
seriously burned.;    "There were popping sounds, and there was tremendous
smoke. I expected death at any moment," said Chiyoe Matsuo, who gathered up
valuables from her home and fled.;    Much of what 4,485-foot Mount Unzen was
spewing is known as pyroclastic flow, or glowing avalanche.;    Much faster
than any lava stream, a glowing avalanche can move dozens of miles per hour
and consists of a superheated, fluid-like emulsion of volcanic ash, gas and
rock fragments too heavy to rise skyward.;    White clouds of steam boiled up
hundreds of yards from the mountain, site of Japan's worst volcanic disaster
200 years ago, when 15,000 people died. The area was jolted by earthquakes
early today, the Meteorological Agency reported.;    Miles away, thick
volcanic ash spattered windshields and covered buildings.;    "We are about
eight kilometers (4.3 miles) away from the volcano. I don't know how far the
lava is going to run, but I don't think it will reach the city," said a
Shimabara city official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.;    Glicken, who
worked for the U.S. Geological Survey until 1989, had moved to Japan to do
research.;    He had been part of the team of scientists studying Mount St.
Helens in Washington state during the months of volcanic activity before the
big eruption on May 18, 1980, said Mike Fuller, chairman of the Geological
Sciences department at UCSB.;    Glicken left an observatory on Mount St.
Helens the day before the volcano blew, said Joan Magruder, a UCSB
spokeswoman. A total of 57 people were killed, including U.S. Geological
Survey scientist David Johnston, who took Glicken's place.;    "If I heard a
volcano was going to erupt, I would head the other direction," Fuller said.
"But vulcanologists head right for it. It's not always a healthy thing.";   
After graduating from Stanford University, Glicken began his graduate work at
UCSB in 1980, Fuller said. Glicken eventually completed his Ph.D. on the topic
of Mount St. Helens in 1986, Fuller said.;    "He was a very serious student
who did good work," Fuller said.;    Prior to Monday's eruption, Glicken, who
is originally from Los Angeles, had been working and living in Tokyo as part
of his research for the university, Fuller said.;    Glicken's father, Milton
Glicken of Los Angeles, said Monday he had not heard from his son for several
weeks.;    The missing also included some police and firefighters who had been
keeping watch and photographing Mount Unzen, which is less than 30 miles from
Nagasaki.;    The search for survivors and bodies began today after the
government mobilized 600 troops and 160 trucks, jeeps and other vehicles from
nearby army bases, said Mamoru Fujisaki, an army spokesman.;    Army armored
transport vehicles moved into the mountainside area, but soldiers were forced
to retreat after an eruption. They recovered four bodies and said 24 others
had been sighted -- 12 from helicopters and 12 from the ground.;    Local
authorities would only immediately confirm the death of a firefighter who died
after being covered with hot ash. News reports said a police officer had also
died Monday, his patrol car inundated as he drove through Kamikoba warning
residents to leave.;    In Tokyo, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu ordered his
Cabinet to set up a special task force to help with the cleanup.;    "There is
no guarantee that another flow of this scale will not occur again," Daisuke
Shimozuru, chairman of the Coordinating Committee for the Prediction of
Volcanic Eruptions, said at a news conference Monday. "But it is nearly
impossible to say when or where.";    The volcano, one of many that form the
Japanese archipelago, had drawn dozens of researchers and onlookers in recent
weeks as it belched smoke and and oozed lava.;    The last deaths from a
volcanic eruption in Japan were in 1962, when Mount Tokachi on the
northernmost island of Hokkaido erupted, killing five people.;    The
Shimabara area is well known for its many hot springs, which draw large
numbers of tourists each year. But the local tourist trade was reduced to a
trickle after the November eruption.;    About 250 volcanoes form the bulk of
the Japanese archipelago -- 8 percent of all the volcanoes in the world. About
75 of them are active; 19 are designated dangerous and remain under constant
surveillance.;    Landslides and tidal waves created by Mount Unzen's 1792
eruption killed 15,000 people, the worst volcanic disaster in Japanese history.  </TEXT>
