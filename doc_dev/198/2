   Scientists spent Tuesday installing new
seismic devices on the flanks of Redoubt Volcano and repairing a
monitor damaged in an eruption last week. Schools were closed
because of an eruption Monday.
   The mountain remained active, but there were no significant
eruptions following Monday's blasts, which pushed ash and steam
eight miles into the air. The ash plume turned daylight to darkness
and blanketed parts of the nearby Kenai Peninsula with up to
three-quarters of an inch of ash.
   In Washington state, scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens
detected little seismic activity Tuesday, but said they're not
ready to declare the volcano has returned to its slumber following
weekend earthquakes.
   Mount Redoubt's latest eruption occurred with little warning.
Scientists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said their most
sensitive monitor was damaged in a violent eruption last week, so
they may have missed the telltale increase in earthquake activity
which signalled previous eruptions.
   Unlike previous eruptions, there was no dome built up over the
eruptive vent prior to Monday's eruption. That prompted scientists
to warn that similar violent eruptions could continue to occur
without warning.
   The volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage had been dormant
for more than two decades before the latest sequence of eruptions
began Dec. 13.
   Monday's ash plume mostly missed the major population
concentrations around Kenai and Homer, but the grit was heavy
enough for officials to close schools Tuesday in Kenai, Soldotna,
Nikiski and Sterling.
   No deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the volcanic
activity, but air travel and holiday mail have been snarled by the
almost continuous eruptions.
   At Mount St. Helens, the weekend earthquakes sent a plume of ash
90 miles to the east, surprising scientists.
   ``It looks quiet right now, but I can't say it's going to stay
calm,'' said Chris Jonientz-Trisler of the University of Washington
Geophysics Center in Seattle, 100 miles north of Mount St. Helens.
   ``It doesn't look at the present time like any eruption is
imminent,'' she said. ``One thing we've learned, though, is
anything can change.''
   Bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain, said
Cliff Hall, an operations staffer with the Cascade Volcano
Observatory.
   ``We're unable to look at what's happened because of the rain
and wind and clouds,'' Hall said.
   Scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from the
volcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rock
beneath the volcano and turning to steam, or from gas released by
cooling molten rock.
   Ash expelled by the volcano over the weekend was tested and
found to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions rather than
freshly erupted matter.
   The volcano's last major eruption occurred on March 19, 1982. A
cataclysmic explosion on May 18, 1980, killed 57 people, devastated
230 square miles and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe.
