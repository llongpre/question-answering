<LEADPARA>  A "swarm" of nearly 1,200 earthquakes is rattling a Sierra ski resort town
that sits inside a giant volcanic crater, but there is little chance of an
eruption, the U.S. Geological Survey said Friday.;    The stepped-up seismic
activity near Mammoth Lakes started March 23, with as many as 60 quakes each
hour, some measuring up to magnitude 3.6 on the Richter scale but most too
tiny to be felt.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     By this week, the number of quakes diminished to an average of five daily.
That is still two to three times as many as during previous months, according
to a weekly report issued by the Geological Survey in Menlo Park.;    Mammoth
Lakes -- with about 4,700 permanent residents and thousands of tourists -- is
located inside the Long Valley caldera, a volcanic crater 19 miles long and 9
miles wide. The area is 150 miles east of San Jose.;    The volcano "continues
to show unrest and has the potential of erupting at some point," said David
Hill, the USGS geophysicist in charge of research at Long Valley. "But we see
no reason to worry over the short run.";    Long Valley and other volcanic
calderas around the world go through decades of episodic quake activity
without erupting.;    "From that, and based on our knowledge of the geological
history of eruptions in the area, we think the chances of an eruption in any
given year are very small, less than a tenth of a percent or so," Hill said
during a telephone interview.;    Between March 23 and Thursday, 1,122 quakes
were detected near Mammoth Lakes.;    Hill said the quakes probably are caused
by increased pressure inside one of the chambers of molten rock, called magma,
located beneath the caldera.;    The increased pressure could be caused either
because more molten rock is being injected into the magma chamber or because
some of the molten rock is crystallizing as it cools, releasing steam and
other gases, he added.;    California's five-year drought hurt the area's ski
business. The quake swarm started just after heavy snow in March brought an
influx of skiers to the resort town. However, most residents and visitors "are
taking it in stride," Hill said.;    "If you're skiing, you probably don't
feel a thing," said USGS geophysicist John Langbein.;    The Long Valley
caldera was created about 730,000 years ago by one of Earth's most powerful
eruptions. The blast spewed 600 times more volcanic debris and ash than the
May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state.;    Eruptions
somewhat smaller than Mount St. Helens' occurred about 650 years ago at the
Mono craters, several miles north of the caldera, and about 550 years ago at
the Inyo craters, which span the caldera's north rim.;    Scientists believe
two or three chambers of molten rock, each perhaps 1 1/2 miles wide, are now
located beneath the caldera and the Inyo-Mono craters, at depths ranging from
4 miles to 6 miles.;    From 1979 to 1984, the area was rocked by thousands of
quakes, including several strong jolts exceeding magnitude 6 on the Richter
scale. Molten rock pushed upward, making the caldera's floor bulge.;    The
activity prompted the Geological Survey to issue a "notice of potential
volcanic hazard" for Long Valley in May 1982, drawing harsh criticism from
local business people who blamed the scare for aggravating a recession in
tourism and real estate.;    The hazard notice was rescinded in 1984 when
quake activity diminished and the agency revised its warning system.;    Quake
swarms resumed under the Mammoth Mountain ski area, on the west edge of the
caldera, in May 1989. The quake activity shifted to the caldera's southern
edge in late 1989 and has continued sporadically since then.;    The swarm
that started last month is the biggest since 1989, Hill said.;    But it
hasn't been accompanied by any increase in upward bulging of the caldera's
floor. The floor has bulged upward about two feet since 1979, but is now
rising at a rate of only three-quarters of an inch annually, Hill said.;   
Hill said scientists are confident they would recognize signs of an imminent
eruption: a sharp increase in bulging and quakes that generate "harmonic
tremor," which indicates large-scale underground movement of molten rock.  </TEXT>
