   A swarm of microearthquakes and
discovery of a possible underground pool of molten rock provide
hints that California's dormant Medicine Lake Volcano might be
reawakening, scientists said Friday.
   However, there is no evidence an eruption is likely, U.S.
Geological Survey scientists said.
   ``It's suspicious enough to put in a new network (of seismic
monitors) but not suspicious enough to cause alarm,'' said John R.
Evans, a seismologist at the agency's western regional headquarters.
   ``If you identify a zone of molten magma beneath a volcano, that
obviously increases the potential for some future activity,'' said
geologist Bob Tilling, who headed the agency's response to the 1980
eruptions of Mount St. Helens. ``There's no evidence now for any
eruption at all. The only prudent thing is to keep monitoring it.''
   The evidence is ambiguous, so it's ``premature to suggest it
represents a reawakening of the volcano,'' said C. Dan Miller, a
geologist with the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory.
   Medicine Lake Volcano is a gently sloped volcano, about 20 miles
in diameter, in the southern Cascade Range about 35 miles northeast
of Mount Shasta, 60 miles north of Lassen Peak and roughly 280 miles
northeast of San Francisco. Medicine Lake, a recreational lake, sits
at an elevation of 6,674 feet on the floor of the volcano's
four-by-seven-mile crater, called a caldera.
   The nearest town, Tulelake, Calif., is 25 miles to the northeast.
   The volcano last erupted about 850 to 875 years ago, forming
small lava flows and cinder cones around several volcanic vents,
Miller said. Between 1,200 and 875 years ago, it had several
explosive eruptions, he said.
   Evans said the recent quakes, detection of the possible magma
chamber and a slight drop in the elevation of the caldera floor in
recent months may indicate magma is moving inside the mountain. But
Miller and Evans agreed the quakes also could have been caused by
non-volcanic stretching of the Earth's crust.
   The USGS installed six new seismometers after the single previous
seismometer detected a swarm of about 200 earthquakes Sept. 29 and
30, Evans said. Before then, only one earthquake, in October 1986,
had been detected at the volcano since the agency started monitoring
in 1981, geologist Steve Walter said.
   The September quakes were shallow and most were microearthquakes
measuring less than 2 on the Richter scale. Four exceeded magnitude
3, including one jolt that reached 4.2, Walter said. Three other
small quakes occurred Oct. 26 and Nov. 11 and 12, he added.
   Evidence for the small magma chamber just northeast of the lake
was found by Evans and geophysicists H. Mahadeva Iver and Phil
Dawson, using the shock xwaves of small explosions to make a picture
of the inside of the volcano.
   They found an area in which shock waves moved slowly, suggesting
they had moved through magma, Evans said. However, Miller said it
also is possible the waves were slowed by porous rock permeated by
hot water.
   The quakes ``may have recorded the intrusion of new magma into
this part of the volcano,'' Evans, Iyer and Dawson said in a study
presented at their agency's Geohazards '88 symposium
   The possible magma pool is small, measuring only about two cubic
miles, compared with a volume of about 200 cubic miles for the magma
chamber believed to be beneath the Long Valley caldera near Mammoth
Lakes, Calif., Evans said.
   Walter and Evans said USGS scientist Dan Dzurisin measured the
elevation of benchmarks on the volcano before the quakes, and found
the mountain had ``deflated'' by seven inches since the last
measurements in 1954. After the September quakes, it had fallen an
additional one-third inch.
   Such deflation suggests magma may have moved outward into cracks
in surrounding rocks, Evans said.
   A much higher level of such activity at Long Valley, along with
much bigger swarms of quakes in the early 1980s, failed to result in
any eruption there, Miller and Tilling said.
