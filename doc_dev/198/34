<LEADPARA>  A volcano belched searing gases, ash and hot rocks onto a small community in
southwestern Japan on Monday, killing as many as 12 people and setting dozens
of homes ablaze.;    About three dozen people were unaccounted for, including
16 journalists as well as police officers, firefighters and researchers who
had been monitoring the volcanic flow.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Officials said the fires and risk of further eruptions made it impossible
for them to search the area to determine the real toll.;    Kyodo News Service
said a 25-year-old police officer was killed in his patrol car as he tried to
warn residents to leave.;    A military rescue helicopter spotted at least six
other bodies near a river early today, Kyodo and television reports said. The
reports later said as many as 11 bodies had been spotted.;    The bodies could
not be retrieved because of their proximity to the broiling debris that also
injured 20 people, 15 of them seriously burned.;    "There is no guarantee
that another flow of this scale will not occur again," said Daisuke Shimozuru,
chairman of the Coordinating Committee for the Prediction of Volcanic
Eruptions. "But it is nearly impossible to say when or where.";    The area
was jolted by 11 earthquakes during the night, the Meteorological Agency
reported today.;    White clouds boiled up hundreds of yards into the sky, and
television reports today showed parts of the mountain still afire from lava
flows.;    The volcano, Mount Unzen, caused landslides and tidal waves that
killed 15,000 people when it erupted 200 years ago -- Japan's worst volcanic
disaster. It is among 19 active volcanoes in Japan listed as dangerous and
kept under constant surveillance.;    An American researcher, Harry Glicken,
was among the missing, according to Joan Magruder, a spokeswoman for the
University of California, Santa Barbara, where Glicken was an assistant
researcher in geological sciences.;    Glicken, who worked for the U.S.
Geological Survey until 1989, narrowly escaped death in the 1980 eruption of
Mount St. Helens in Washington state. He was scheduled to be on an observation
post the day the mountain blew up but happened to switch shifts with another
man, who died in the May 18, 1980, eruption.;    Officials at Tokyo
Metropolitan University said Glicken had headed for Mount Unzen on June 2. He
and a French couple had been making daily appearances at a research site near
the mountain but have not returned since Monday, the officials said.;   
Authorities ordered some 5,000 people to evacuate Monday after the volcano,
which began its latest series of eruptions May 24.  </TEXT>
