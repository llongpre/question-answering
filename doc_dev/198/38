<LEADPARA>  For two days after ominous earthquakes and rising magma led to the evacuation
of nearly 90,000 people around Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, the Menlo
Park geologist who predicted the volcano's eruption wondered whether he had
done the right thing.;    "Your emotional swings are tremendous in a thing
like this," David Harlow of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park said
Monday after returning from a month near the volcano. "Are we doing the right
thing? Is our interpretation correct?"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Harlow and a team of 14 other American and Filipino scientists proved
prescient when Pinatubo erupted June 12 in the first of a series of
spectacular explosions that are continuing. At least 296 people have died and
20 are missing, a tiny fraction of the number of people who would have been
killed without accurate forecasts.;    The evacuation in the Philippines was
the most successful effort ever to marry the new science of volcano prediction
with local disaster planning to save lives.;    'Not a lot of heroes'; 
Harlow, 47, one of a handful of volcano seismologists in the world, discounted
his "Indiana Jones" reputation and said the successful forecast and evacuation
was the result of "a lot of people taking a lot of responsibility and making
hard decisions. It was not an effort that had a lot of heroes, frankly.";   
Working with less than four hours of sleep per night in a windowless building
at Clark Air Force Base about 15 miles from the volcano, the geologists told
local and military commanders on June 8, that they could not guarantee the
volcano would not explode in the next 24 hours.;    That forecast triggered
the evacuation, June 10. The eruption could still have been weeks, or even
months, away, Harlow said.;    The only time he felt in danger, Harlow said,
was when the first major eruption came two days later.;    At 6 a.m. the ash
cloud and a small typhoon had completely obscured the mountain, leaving the
team dependent on its instruments: a string of seven seismographs to detect
earthquakes and two tiltmeters to measure the creep of the earth. By 10 a.m.,
the team was nervous enough to leave the base themselves.;    To leave or
stay?;  "Once we got outside the walls, we began to have second thoughts and
decided, 'Nah, we can handle this,' " Harlow said. "So we went back onto the
base.";    By 2 p.m., all the instrument stations between the geologists and
the volcano were out of service, and the team piled into a station wagon to
move about nine miles east.;    "By that time, it was as dark as the middle of
the night," Harlow said. "Ash was falling out of the sky. . . . All that time,
one of us was sitting out the window of the car, squirting soda on the
windshield to keep the mud and ash off. We were glad we had it.";    On the
open-ended Volcanic Explosivity Index, Pinatubo has been graded a high 5 or
low 6, making it one of the two or three largest eruptions this century. For
comparison, Mount St. Helens was a low 5. For Harlow, who has studied
volcanoes for more than 20 years, the experience was among the most rewarding
of his life.;    "One could say the volcano behaved very nicely," he said. "It
performed on schedule."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Robert Tilling of the USGS will
present a slide show, "Volcano: Friend or Foe," at 7 p.m. Thursday in the USGS
Building 3 conference room, 345 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park.  </TEXT>
