   Mount St. Helens belched volcanic ash
and steam nearly 6 miles into the air Monday, and the powdery
fallout settled up to 65 miles away in Oregon.
   There were no reports of damage and scientists said they had no
evidence of a bigger eruption in the offing.
   Ashfall from the 8,364-foot mountain 100 miles south of Seattle
was reported as far away as The Dalles, Ore., 65 miles to the
southeast, said geologist Steve Brantley of the U.S. Geological
Survey.
   Residents of neighboring towns were not in any danger,
authorities said.
   The explosion, recorded on volcano seismographs at 2:07 a.m.,
sent a plume of ash 30,000 feet into the air, said Chris
Jonientz-Trisler, a researcher at the University of Washington.
Winds carried the ash plume to the southeast, toward the Columbia
River and into Oregon, the National Weather Service said.
   Jonientz-Trisler said the explosion was ``very minor, minor,
minor'' compared with a May 18, 1980, eruption that leveled 230
square miles of forest, left 57 people dead or missing and sent up
an ash cloud that circled the globe.
   ``This kind of thing is more like the steam and ash explosions
that occurred last winter in December and January,'' she said.
``Any hazards should be fairly confined to the crater.''
   Scientists monitoring the volcano say there has been a gradual
increase in small earthquakes there in the past three years. There
was no evidence, however, that they were associated with Monday's
eruption.
   ``The steam and gases that are involved here could come from a
couple of sources,'' Jonientz-Trisler said. ``It could come from
the magma, bubbling out of solution, or it could be rain and
snowmelt percolating down (to hot areas) and bursting into steam.
It's probably a bit of both processes.''
   In the past, series of earthquakes have occurred in the days
before eruptions of Mount St. Helens.
   The volcano's last large eruption was on March 19, 1982, when
mud flowed from the crater for six miles. Since then, the mountain
has had a series of ``dome-building'' eruptions in which the
mountain adds lava to the heap in its crater. The last one occurred
in October 1986.
   The cataclysmic 1980 eruption blew off the top 1,300 feet of the
once-symmetrical peak, a lava dome dating to about the 16th
century.
