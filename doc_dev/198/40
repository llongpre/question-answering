   Molten rock moving beneath California's
Mammoth Mountain ski resort triggered thousands of small
earthquakes since May, but the U.S. Geological Survey says the old
volcano is unlikely to erupt.
   ``We still see occasional bursts of quake activity, but it's
much more sporadic'' in recent weeks than in June, when hundreds of
tiny jolts each day rattled the 11,053-foot mountain in the Sierra
Nevada, said USGS geophysicist Dave Hill, the scientist in charge
of monitoring the situation.
   In a statement issued Monday, the federal agency said: ``While
eruptive activity as a consequence of this current earthquake swarm
cannot be ruled out, observations at many volcanoes in the world
suggest the most likely outcome ... is a return to an extended
period of relative quiescence.''
   Hill discussed the ``swarm'' of quakes under Mammoth Mountain
during a Monday session at the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting.
   Only four of the thousands of quakes that started May 4 measured
more than 3 on the Richter scale, so most were too small to be
felt. Some of the quakes were only 1.5 miles deep and often came in
rapid-fire bursts.
   Mammoth Mountain has bulged upward about one-half inch since
May, Hill said.
   The most likely explanation for the quakes and bulging is that
molten rock, or magma, is being squeezed into a vertical crack that
extends from 3.5 miles to 6 miles below Mammoth Mountain's south
flank, he said.
   This sheetlike intrusion is called a dike, and excavations at
many old volcanoes reveal that most dikes never erupt to the
surface, Hill explained.
   Mammoth Mountain, now covered with ski runs, last erupted
explosively about 50,000 years ago and is located just outside the
southwest rim of Long Valley caldera. The caldera is a
20-by-10-mile oval-shaped crater created 730,000 years ago by one
of the world's greatest eruptions.
   That blast spewed at least 600 times more material than the May
18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens.
   The resort town of Mammoth Lakes sits inside the caldera a few
miles east of Mammoth Mountain. Hill cautioned against undue
volcano phobia, saying it is ``more dangerous to drive up on U.S.
395 than to spend time skiing or living near Mammoth Lakes.''
