<DESCRIPT>  VOLCANO; JAPAN  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  With a powerful midnight explosion that hurled stones more than three miles, a
Japanese volcano erupted Wednesday for the second time in nine days, and
scientists warned that a new and far more dangerous blast was in prospect.;   
The second eruption of Mount Unzen, near Shimabara in southwestern Japan,
smashed windows and roof tiles but was not reported to have caused any
injuries.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Scientists said the Japanese eruption was unrelated to that of Mount
Pinatubo in the Philippines.;    Police called for precautions to be taken at
several more towns near the volcano. They also banned ships from the sea near
the peninsula where the volcano is located for fear of a deadly tsunami, or
sea wave induced by an earthquake.;    Scientists said their instruments had
detected a swelling of the volcano, indicating a buildup of pressure within
the 4,450-foot peak, and counted 18 tremors near the mountain Wednesday.;   
Also, it has been raining on the steaming mountain, which lies about 40 miles
east of Nagasaki and some 600 miles southwest of Tokyo on the island of
Kyushu. That has increased fears of mudslides as swollen creeks breach their
banks and loosen the accumulations of ash.;    Even though Unzen and Pinatubo
are both long-dormant volcanoes in the Far East that came violently to life
within days of each other, most volcanologists maintain that their
simultaneous eruptions are a coincidence.;    "There isn't any connection,"
said David Lescinsky, a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution and a
member of the Global Vulcanism Network. "These are two major ones, but it is
not unique that they are occurring at the same time.";    Some geologists are
investigating the possibility that the eruptions may be linked to a lurch of
one of the tectonic plates that make up Earth's crust. This idea, however,
appears to be a long shot.;    Though the two volcanoes are on the same plate,
Mount Pinatubo and Mount Unzen are so far away from each other that most
geologists say there is no direct link between the two events.;    At any one
time, several volcanoes are bubbling away or exploding someplace in the world,
often in its more obscure corners. Lescinsky said that in the last month more
than a dozen volcanoes have erupted, or at least become significantly active.  </TEXT>
