   Redoubt Volcano slipped into slumber
after gushing ash and steam eight miles high, but air traffic
remained disrupted because of concerns about engine-clogging
fallout.
   ``Seismically, the volcano is fairly quiet right now,''
geologist Robert McGimsey of the Alaska Volcano Observatory said
Wednesday afternoon. ``We have no reports of eruptions.''
   Scientists said it was too early to predict what the reduced
seismic activity might mean. They said they would not be surprised
if seismic energy rebuilds again at the mountain 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage.
   The Alaska Volcano Observatory recorded the last explosive
eruption at 2:44 a.m. Wednesday. The volcano's first violent
eruption in days came at 5:48 p.m. Tuesday. It was the largest
since Redoubt thundered awake in mid-December after a 25-year sleep.
   Pilots on Tuesday reported a plume of ash and steam to 40,000
feet and what appeared to be lava flowing down the volcano's
northwest flank, observatory scientists said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said there were no pilots'
reports of ash on Wednesday, and the Alaska Division of Emergency
Services reported no significant ash accumulations on the ground.
   Nevertheless, Delta and United airlines canceled flights until
at least today and international airlines, some of which use
Anchorage as a refueling stop, diverted planes to other airports.
   Alaska Airlines said it offered all but two of its scheduled
flights. MarkAir, an intrastate carrier, resumed daylight flying
Wednesday after a three-hour delay.
   The failure of all four engines on a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
passenger jet last month was blamed on ash from Redoubt. The plane
made a safe emergency landing in Anchorage after the engines were
restarted.
   Scientists tried to check on the reported lava flow Wednesday,
but clouds frustrated an attempted aerial observation.
   ``They didn't get any kind of visual on the volcano at all,''
McGimsey said. ``It was a real disappointing flight.''
   The observers found at least one large mudflow was generated by
the eruption Tuesday. Mud filled the 1\-mile-wide flood plain of
the Drift River and extended about 20 miles, the Volcano
Observatory said in a news release. Boulders up to about 13 feet in
diameter were observed.
   Some flooding was evident at the Drift River oil storage
facility 20 miles from the volcano, the observatory said. Water
flowed around a levee but did not penetrate dikes protecting
individual tanks. Flood waters also crossed an airstrip.
   Cook Inlet Pipe Line Co., operator of the Drift River facility,
on Tuesday evacuated the 11 people who were there. The company said
weather and ash on Wednesday prevented it from determining when
operations might resume. Power at the facility was interrupted, the
company said.
   After a quarter century of silence, the peak erupted Dec. 13 and
spewed ash 33,000 feet into the air the next day. Varying levels of
seismic activity continued through the month.
