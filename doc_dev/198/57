   Redoubt Volcano belched an 8-mile-high
cloud of ash that turned day to night in a town 200 miles away and
apparently clogged all four engines of an airliner, forcing an
emergency landing.
   The mountain 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, which ended a
23-year slumber with an eruption Thursday, erupted twice Friday,
and could continue to spew ash, said seismologists with the U.S.
Geological Survey.
   The huge plume of ash was tentatively blamed for the failure of
all four engines on a Boeing 747 passenger jet that made a safe
emergency landing here at 12:25 p.m. Friday, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
   Engines on the KLM Royal Dutch Airlines plane traveling from
Amsterdam stopped after the aircraft passed through volcanic ash
undetected by radar, FAA spokeswoman Mary Lou Wojtalik said.
   The plane fell 13,000 feet before all engines were restarted and
Flight 867 landed without injury to the 245 people aboard, she said.
   The massive ash cloud drifted at noon over the town of
Talkeetna, a staging point for Mount McKinley climbers that lies
about 200 miles northeast of the volcano, blotting out the sun and
depositing 3 inches of ash on the ground.
   ``It blotted out the sun,'' said Brad Ault, a dispatcher with
the state troopers. ``It was like night for about an hour.''
   Redoubt erupted early Friday morning and again shortly after 10
a.m. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey were unable to
reach the remote site in Lake Clark National Park by plane because
of bad weather and had to depend on instruments that measure ground
motion to track the eruptions.
   The volcano is of a type that erupts explosively, throwing ash
and rocks skyward.
   More eruptions are possible, said USGS geologist Don Richter.
   ``I don't like to use the word `normal,' but a group of
eruptions is typical of a volcano,'' Richter said.
   Friday's late-morning eruption shook the ground for miles, said
Charlotte Rowe, a seismologist at the University of Alaska
Fairbanks Geophysical Institute. The corrosive ash fallout bypassed
Anchorage and drifted to the northeast, as it had a day earlier.
   Much of the cloud _ which reached heights of 40,000 feet, or
about 8 miles _dissipated.
   The Alaska Division of Emergency Services said any remaining ash
was expected to move into Canada, then turn south.
   Talkeetna bartender Shannon Tobiason said most people remained
indoors.
   ``This place is covered,'' Tobiason said. ``There's about 3
inches (of ash) on the car windshields. Everything here is brown
and there is a sulfur smell.''
   In Anchorage, the international airport remained open, although
some carriers suspended or reduced operations. The FAA continued to
restrict flying in the area of the volcano. The agency said the KLM
plane was where it was supposed to be when it passed through the
ash.
