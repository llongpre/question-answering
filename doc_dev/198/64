<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo shot a cloud of ash and steam nearly 19 miles high today in the
biggest eruption since it came to life this week. An approaching typhoon
threatened to trigger mudflows down the volcano.;    After sunset the volcano
erupted again, lighting up the night sky. Two streams of orange, glowing
material flowed from the crater.  </LEADPARA>

IT MAY TRIGGER MUDFLOWS AS PHILIPPINE VOLCANO

<TEXT>     Scientists initially thought it was the first flow of lava in a week of
eruptions. But Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology and Seismology, said the glow was actually an "incandescent
pyroclastic flow," hot gases, stones and ash that travel at high speeds and
are an even greater threat than lava.;    As if the volcano were not enough,
the Manila weather bureau reported today that a typhoon was headed for the
eastern coast of Luzon island with maximum winds of 110 miles per hour.;   
Typhoon Yunya was expected to come ashore late Saturday or Sunday near Baler,
90 miles northeast of Mount Pinatubo. Heavy rain began falling today in Manila
and central Luzon.;    If the typhoon brings more rain, scientists fear it
will unleash mudflows -- giant rivers of earth, boulders and debris fused
together with sticky volcanic ash.;    Kelvin Rodolfo, a Filipino-American
geology professor from the University of Illinois-Chicago, said mudflows
represented one of the most serious dangers from Mount Pinatubo because they
could bury towns and settlements quickly under tons of debris.;    At least
four people died; four were missing and 24 injured since Pinatubo began
erupting Sunday after being dormant for 600 years, officials said. About
79,000 people, including 15,000 Americans, have been evacuated.;    The
thunderous explosions today spewed ash over a wide area, including the
evacuated Clark Air Base 10 miles east of the volcano and Subic Bay naval base
25 miles to the southwest, where the Clark personnel are being temporarily
housed.;    At Clark, the remaining 1,500 U.S. service members guarding the
installation donned goggles and surgical masks.;    The mayor of Olongapo,
Richard Gordon, urged residents to stay indoors because ash was falling like a
hailstorm and had accumulated up to three inches deep. Subic Bay naval base is
located next to Olongapo.;    The volcano's fallout made the town look "like
nighttime" in midafternoon, correspondent Louella Vizcocho said by telephone.;
   Mount Pinatubo had been calm more than 24 hours after a major eruption
Thursday morning that shot ash more than 15 miles high, but scientists had
said pressure was intensifying within the 4,795-foot volcano.;    Then at
least four blasts within 2 1/2 hours of each other occurred today, sending ash
nearly 19 miles high.;    The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and
Seismology said the fourth blast was the largest of 10 eruptions since
Sunday.;    During the evening eruption, seismologist Julio Sabit said the sky
darkened and then dramatically lit up.;    "The fireworks of Pinatubo began,"
the excited Sabit said by radio.;    Radio reporters at the scene said the
spectacle cast a gentle, orange glow over the summit of the volcano. "It's
very beautiful," reporter Vic Lima said. "There's a stream of orange flow on
the two sides of the volcano.";    About 64,000 people have been evacuated,
most of them since major eruptions began on Wednesday. Food was reported
running low at refugee camps.;    Police said 12 people have been arrested for
allegedly looting parts of Clark Air Base, which nearly 15,000 Americans and
their families evacuated last Monday.;    Many of the Americans expressed
concern for the safety of their belongings, but Air Force officials assured
them that the 1,500 security guards would be sufficient to protect homes and
barracks.;    The Office of Civil Defense said that at least four people have
been killed in eruptions this week. Unofficial reports by local officials and
survivors put the death toll at 10.;    Rescue agencies said they were still
trying to confirm the unofficial reports and some or all of these may be added
to official counts later.;    At least 24 people were injured and four were
missing, the civil defense agency said.  </TEXT>
