   Redoubt Volcano spewed a column of
steam seven miles long on a day when three moderate earthquakes
jolted the region.
   Shallow tremors around the volcano late Friday led scientists at
the Alaska Volcano Observatory to keep a close watch on the
volcano. Scientists predicted another explosion in the next few
weeks as Redoubt rebuilds its dome.
   Accompanied by a rare lightning storm, Redoubt belched steam at
9:51 a.m. AST. The plume carried little ash and drifted mostly to
the north and northwest, away from population centers.
   A quake centered 50 miles beneath Redoubt and measuring 5.5 on
the Richter scale hit at 3:24 a.m. Friday, seismologists said.
   The second quake, at 8:03 a.m., was centered about 170 miles
southwest of Fairbanks and registered 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   A third quake, registering 5.2 and centered 65 miles southwest
of Anchorage, struck at 5:11 p.m. It shook office fixtures in
Anchorage but caused no apparent damage, authorities said.
   Redoubt, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, began erupting in
mid-December after slumbering for 25 years.
   On Feb. 28, an eruption of abrasive ash reached Anchorage,
closing schools, forcing precautionary evacuations at an oil
terminal on the banks of the Drift River, which flows off the
volcano.
