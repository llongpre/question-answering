   The remote volcano that formed the tiny
island of Kiska in the Aleutian chain has reawakened after 21 years
of dormancy.
   The volcano erupted for several hours Friday, throwing a cloud of
steamy ash thousands of feet skyward over the Bering Sea, witnesses
said.
   Kiska Island, is an uninhabited island that was occupied by
Japanese military forces in World War II and later made a national
historic landmark.
   It is located about 100 miles east of Attu Island, the
westernmost tip of the Aleutian Chain.
   Witnesses 60 miles to the east at a U.S. Navy station on Amchitka
Island first spotted the white steam clouds at about 10 a.m. They
reported watching the steam mix with a dark cloud of ash until
weather conditions obscured the view about three hours later.
   Reeves Air Capt. James Fredenhagen, who took off from Amchitka at
about 3 p.m., said he saw a small plume of steam was rising slowly
from the 4,000-foot Kiska Volcano.
   ``I classify it as a mild eruption,'' he said. ``We caught sight
of it at 7,000 feet. You could see the haze. ... It appeared to be
coming from the crater.''
   Kiska is one of 40 active volcanos in the Aleutian Chain, said
Victoria Avery, a University of Alaska graduate student working at
the Alaska Volcano Observatory.
   The observatory doesn't monitor Kiska Volcano and must rely on
reports from pilots and other witnesses for information, Ms. Avery
said.
   ``As far as magnitude, it doesn't seem to be a major explosive
event,'' she said.
   The last eruption noted at the mountain was in 1969, when six
days of venting sent lava flowing over island tundra. Kiska Volcano
also was active from January 1962 to March 1964, spilling magma and
spewing ash.
   Another dormant Alaska volcano, Redoubt, came to life last
December after a 25-year slumber. It has spewed ash periodically
since then. Redoubt is 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.
