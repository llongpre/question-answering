   Terry Drinkwater, a CBS News correspondent
who covered Patricia Hearst's kidnapping, Mount St. Helens'
eruption and his own battle with cancer, died of the disease. He
was 53.
   Drinkwater died Wednesday at his home in Malibu.
   ``Terry Drinkwater was one of the people who helped invent
television news reporting _ helped make it what it is,'' anchorman
Dan Rather said in a tribute broadcast at the end of the ``CBS
Evening News'' on Wednesday. ``It won't be the same without him.''
   Drinkwater was treated for a larynx tumor in 1983, which was
included as a segment in an award-winning series he prepared on
cancer treatment. He filed his last report for CBS in August 1988.
   ``His reports about his own illness were devoid of self-pity,
and characteristically written with elegance and flair,'' said
Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast group. ``His death
deprives CBS of one of its most valued craftsmen.''
   As a senior correspondent based in Los Angeles, Drinkwater
covered airline disasters, politics, space exploration, and
specialized in reporting on energy and environmental issues.
   The tall, touseled correspondent often reported from the
wilderness. He was frequently in Alaska, covering the 1967 flood in
Fairbanks, the opening of the trans-Alaska pipeline in 1977 and on
wilderness and development issues.
   Drinkwater's series on cancer was awarded an Alfred I.
Dupont-Columbia University Award, one of the most prestigious in
broadcast journalism. He also received three Emmy Awards and a
George Foster Peabody Award.
   Drinkwater founded two radio stations, KPFK-FM in Los Angeles
and WBAI-FM in New York.
   He also covered many political campaigns, traveling with the
press corps during the presidential campaigns of Californians
Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as well as Robert Kennedy and
Barry Goldwater.
   His primary assignment, however, was as a regional correspondent
whose beat allowed him to roam the West, from the Rocky Mountains
to Alaska's Prudhoe Bay.
   He covered nuclear testing in Nevada, the Hearst kidnapping, the
Watts riots, the eruption of Mount St. Helens and the Pacific
Southwest Airlines and Aeromexico airline disasters in California.
   Drinkwater joined CBS in 1963 after working as a reporter at
television station KTLA in Los Angeles.
   A native of Denver, he was graduated from Pomona College in
Claremont in 1958. He earned a Master of Arts from the University
of California, Berkeley in 1959.
   He is survived by a son, Croft; a daughter, Angela; both of Los
Angeles; a sister, Dorsey Stevenson of Santa Monica, and his
mother, Helen Drinkwater of Los Angeles. No services were planned.
