<LEADPARA>  Thousands of U.S. Air Force personnel were given orders to leave today and the
last group of military dependents began the journey home as an expert
predicted possible new eruptions on Mount Pinatubo.;    Fears of new eruptions
and landslides again drove Filipinos from their homes today.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     About 3,000 Americans sailed from Subic Bay Naval Base aboard the aircraft
carrier Abraham Lincoln bound for Cebu, where they will catch flights to the
United States.;    "I can't wait to get out of here," Tess Machinsky, 44, of
Seattle, said as she prepared to board the Abraham Lincoln. "This place is a
mess.";    The U.S. Embassy said all 20,000 military family members have now
left Subic. The naval base's population swelled by nearly 15,000 when the Air
Force evacuated troops and dependents from Clark Air Base on June 10 after the
nearby volcano began erupting for the first time in more than 600 years.;   
An Air Force spokesman, Maj. Wayne Crist, also announced that 4,500 air
personnel would begin loading later today aboard the carrier Midway in a move
that would reduce Air Force troops by more than 60 percent.;    At Clark, 10
miles east of the volcano, people who toured the base today said flows of hot
rocks, gas and other volcanic debris had reached within 300 feet of Clark's
Mactan housing area. The flow was still smoking today.;    Mount Pinatubo was
quiet after seven small ash eruptions Thursday, but a government expert said
tremors suggest eruptions could occur.;    "We are recognizing some long
tremor periods and earthquakes, and this means that some magma is again moving
to the surface," said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.;    He said it was impossible to
predict when new eruptions could begin.;    Many Filipinos who had returned to
their homes after the volcano quieted down began leaving again today, worried
by the eruption prediction and fearing heavy rains may unleash tons of debris
from the volcano's slopes.;    Two weeks of eruptions on the 4,795-foot
volcano, about 60 miles north of Manila, has claimed at least 268 lives.;   
Rivers in central Luzon were reported rising today as volcanic ash washed into
the streams after two days of steady rains. In Capas, near the volcano, police
said three refugee children were swept away by floodwaters Thursday and feared
dead.;    Roy David, mayor of Porac west of Angeles, said he had urged
residents who fled to evacuation centers not to return home because of the
rising Porac River. He estimates about 80 percent of the town's 68,000
residents have fled since June 9 when eruptions began.;    "Mudflows have
already cascaded down the slopes of Mount Pinatubo, and the silt in the Porac
River is steadily rising," he said.;    Jose Pangilinan, a resident of Angeles
City adjacent to Clark, said he was returning his wife and two children to his
relatives' home in nearby Apalit town.;    "I can't take chances; it could be
real bad," Pangilinan said. He said he returned to his home in Angeles last
Wednesday to inspect damage from a huge mudflow that roared through city
streets before dawn last Sunday.;    Richard Gordon, major of Olongapo, said a
landslide along a major highway leading to the city near Subic was preventing
supplies from reaching the more than 300,000 residents.;    "If we cannot pass
through that landslide, we cannot supply goods to Olongapo (and other towns),"
Gordon said.;    About 1,500 air personnel will remain to guard Clark, and
1,000 others will stay at the Subic Bay Naval Base, said Navy spokesman Lt.
Cmdr. Kevin Mukri.  </TEXT>
