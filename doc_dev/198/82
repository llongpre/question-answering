   Redoubt Volcano erupted again Friday,
shooting out a seven-mile-high plume of ash that drifted away from
population centers, officials said.
   ``There is nothing heading for the Anchorage area or the Kenai
Peninsula,'' a populated area near the volcano, said Cynthia
Gardner, a geologist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.
   No ash was falling in the Drift River area, where fallout from
previous eruptions had hindered loading at an oil facility, she
said. Ash was moving to the north and northwest of the volcano, she
said.
   Seismologists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said the
``moderate-size eruption'' at 9:51 a.m. contained less ash than
previous blasts, said observatory spokesman John Paskievitch.
   Scientists at the observatory were trying to determine if there
was any connection between the eruption and earthquakes that
occured in the same area Friday, Paskievitch said.
   A quake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale hit at 3:24 a.m. AST,
and seismologists said the quake was centered 50 miles beneath
Redoubt. Another quake, registering 5.2 and centered in the same
region, struck at 5:11 p.m..
   A third quake hit at 8:03 a.m. It was centered about 170 miles
southwest of Fairbanks and registered 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   Bobbi McGlashan, a spokeswoman at Anchorage International
Airport, said it was business as usual there.
   ``It's not doing anything to us,'' McGlashan said. ``No flights
have been diverted and none canceled.''
   On Feb. 28, the abrasive ash reached Anchorage, closing schools,
forcing precautionary evacuations at the Drift River Oil Terminal
and the Air Force to move its F-15 fighters into hangars Elmendorf
Air Force Base.
   Redoubt Volcano is 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   It erupted in mid-December after slumbering for 25 years. A
series of explosive eruptions around Christmas slowed or diverted
holiday air traffic and mail.
