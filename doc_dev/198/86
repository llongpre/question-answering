   Scores of small quakes have rattled an
Aleut fishing village during the past 17 days, and geologists say
they are keeping a wary eye on the possible source: a volcano
that's been dormant for centuries.
   King Cove village is only nine miles from Mount Dutton's
4,834-foot peak. About 1,000 people live in the village during the
summer; 700 stay through winter.
   Aside from the earthquakes that have been jolting the community
625 miles southwest of Anchorage, there have been no other signs of
an imminent eruption, said Betsy Yount, a U.S. Geological Survey
geologist here.
   ``There's no melting back of snow around the summit. No
steam-type vents,'' sher said Wednesday. ``We're still assessing
the seismic activity to determine whether it's related to volcanic
activity or not.''
   Geologists are unsure when Mount Dutton last erupted.
   ``There's no historical records of its erupting. That means in
the past 200 or so years,'' said John Davies, state seismologist
and coordinating scientist for the newly formed Alaska Volcano
Observatory. ``It may have erupted 500 years ago, but we have no
date. Clearly, it's erupted in the last 10,000 years or so.''
   John Taber, a geologist with Columbia University's Lamont
Doherty Geological Observatory at Palisades, N.Y., said
seismographs first picked up earthquake activity near Mount Dutton
on July 11. Some of the 18 instruments installed by the institute
to monitor Aleutian Arc volcanic activity indicated the first
temblors were centered 10 to 15 miles southeast of the peak, he
said.
   ``In the last three or four days its been dying off,'' Taber
said from the institute's Sand Point office. ``There's no cause for
concern at this point at all. There was a sequence of (earthquakes)
in 1984. They were smaller, but they went on for about four months.
It's not even unusual to have them there.''
   Scores of quakes ranging from 1.0 to 3.6 on the Richter scale
have struck in this round. The peak activity occurred Friday, when
127 were recorded, Taber said. On Monday, there were 25, he said.
   The epicenters moved slowly toward the Mount Dutton, and in the
last few days, the centers have been underneath the volcano's south
flank, Taber said.
   The temblors have jolted the nearby village regularly. ``We've
felt four or five in a day, that's probably the most. But there's
no other sign of activity at all,'' said Cynthia Samuelson, city
clerk the village on the Alaska Peninsula. ``People are concerned,
but no one's leaving.''
   Alaska Division of Emergency Services officials had been
scheduled to travel to King Cove in September, but went this week
because of the earthquakes, said Jim Sey, the agency's chief of
operations and planning.
   ``The main purpose was just to answer questions, make people
aware and bring them up to date on what's happening and explain
different things they could do if there were an eruption,'' Sey
said.
   A telephone line is being installed so that the Geophysical
Institute at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks can monitor Taber's
seismographs, plus one Davies recently installed on the mountain's
flank. Taber has been in Alaska servicing his observatory's
seismographs and plans to leave this week, Davies said.
   The link will allow scientists in Fairbanks to check the
volcano's pulse virtually around the clock, he said.
   ``We're going to monitor it as closely as we can,'' he said.
