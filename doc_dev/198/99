the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  Once the United States' largest overseas air base, this strategic military
installation may be crippled permanently, U.S. officials said Sunday as damage
reports continued to increase from last week's devastating eruption of Mount
Pinatubo.;    A six-hour tour of Clark showed that the eruption spewed a
deadly torrent of superheated gas, rocks and mud up to 20 feet high down a
river valley only a few hundred yards behind an officers' housing complex and
elementary school. It also sent waist-deep mud and swirling water across parts
of the base, damaging the hospital and washing cars and trucks away.  </LEADPARA>

AIR BASE AGAIN
ERUPTIONS COULD CONTINUE FOR 3 YEARS, SCIENTISTS
SAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     At least 30 huge aircraft hangers, warehouses, a gymnasium and other
buildings were crushed from heavy gray ash that blankets runways, roads and
rooftops up to a foot deep in places. Falling trees damaged homes, a school
and other structures.;    With 10 new volcanic explosions Sunday, new ash
continues to rain down on Clark, only 8.6 miles away. Worse, scientists say
Pinatubo may remain active and dangerous for up to three years, spewing
volcanic debris that endangers lives, threatens aircraft and fouls sensitive
communications equipment.;    "It'll take a long time to get Clark back and
operating, if ever," Stanley Schrager, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Manila,
said Sunday.;    Lt. Col. Ron Rand, a Clark spokesman, said it was not clear
whether the Air Force ever could use runways and fly so close to an erupting
volcano. The ash is much finer than the desert sand that pilots overcame
during the Persian Gulf war.;    Moreover, the giant "pyroclastic flow" of
searing gas, steam and mud that roared at least 10 miles down the Sacobia
River, a short walk behind dozens of now ash-covered homes, broken trees and
the partially collapsed Grissom Elementary School in Clark's Mactan housing
complex, indicates that the base is directly endangered by future eruptions.; 
  The Pentagon temporarily has transferred some of the base's essential
operations -- including training, airlift capability and special operations --
to other bases in the Western Pacific, particularly Guam and Okinawa.
Officials say the transfers may become permanent if the base is deemed
inoperable.;    No precise figures are available, but damage and cleanup from
the June 15 eruption is likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars at
Clark and the equally stricken Subic Bay Naval Base and dockyard, where more
than 122 buildings were badly damaged or destroyed.;    Subic's activities may
be temporarily relocated as well, officials said, but no decision has been
made yet. Subic is less likely to close permanently, however, since its ship
repair, refueling and resupply facilities are easier to maintain.  </TEXT>
