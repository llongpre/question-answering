Don Casey, having been given no indication of his future as Clipper coach, will 
fly to the East Coast early Sunday morning to interview for the basketball job 
at Rider College in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, who has directed a late-season Clipper resurgence that has brought 
praise from his own players and the opposition alike, said Thursday he will 
take a red-eye flight from Sacramento to Philadelphia shortly after the team's 
season finale Saturday night against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet with officials at Rider, a Division I school with an 
enrollment of approximately 5,000, Monday. John Carpenter, the college's 
longtime basketball coach, moved up to become athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an interest," Casey said, cautioning that this is not an ultimatum 
directed at Clipper management. "What it comes down to is, do I want to coach 
or do I not want to coach? Right now, the feeling is I want to coach. I'd 
rather coach these kids (the Clippers) than any other kids, but I have to 
consider any offer anyone else has. 
</P>
<P>
"My first priority still would be to be a pro coach. I'm not saying it (the 
Rider job) has been offered and I'm not saying I will take it. It's a normal 
business process." 
</P>
<P>
Casey's roots run deep in the Philadelphia-New Jersey area, and Rider is 
located in Lawrenceville, not far from Princeton. He grew up in Collingswood, 
N.J., and became an assistant and then head coach at Temple. He had lived in 
the area all his life until becoming an assistant with the Chicago Bulls in 
1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper officials remained non-committal about their interim head coach, who 
has compiled a 11-31 record since taking over for Gene Shue Jan. 19, including 
10-10 since March 10. 
</P>
<P>
Although no word on Casey's status with the Clippers is expected soon, the 
Clippers plan to talk with him next week.
