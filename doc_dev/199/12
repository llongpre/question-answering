"I can just see it," said a student wearing a University of Southern California 
Trojans T-shirt as he stepped through the security gates of the new campus 
bookstore. "Attention, Trojan shoppers!" he intoned solemnly. "On Level Three, 
a special on . . . ring binders!" 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't far off. The new USC bookstore has a distinct modern-department-store 
look. Opened for business July 17 on the main campus drag and inaugurated last 
week, it occupies 34,000 square feet in a new five-story building that cost the 
university $8.8 million in construction and installation. The retail operation 
takes up four floors, connected by central banks of escalators -- not high on 
the list of things one expects to see in a bookstore. Sleek shelving is set not 
in the old-fashioned perpendicular way but diagonally to the aisles; marketing 
experts have discovered that this configuration draws the eye through the store 
and invites browsing. 
</P>
<P>
The clearest trend in college bookstores, says Elizabeth Kennedy, marketing 
manager of the USC facility, is that "we're moving out of the attitude that 
students have to shop here just because we're here and we're accessible. 
Universities didn't use to invest much in college stores -- they put them in 
the basement." 
</P>
<P>
College stores have come out of the cellar. In recent years, money has been 
poured into these operations. UC San Diego is dedicating its newly expanded 
store this week, and UC Irvine is constructing a larger bookstore, due to open 
in January as part of its new UCI Student Center. Since the surge in college 
enrollment during the 1970s, estimates Garis Distelhorst, executive director of 
the National Assn. of College Stores, as many as four out of five college 
stores have been "renovated, remodeled or rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
The old USC store occupied only 8,300 square feet in the student commons. 
Although ranked only 10th nationally in total sales among college stores in 
1988-89, it sold more per square foot than any other store -- a statistical way 
of saying it was immensely crowded. The store was so small that at "rush" time 
-- the beginning of a term, when students buy required course materials -- 
one-third of all the general books were physically packed up and moved out to 
make space for texts. The new store is so spacious that students lining up for 
rush purchases are ushered neatly through a rope maze leading to the cash 
registers; in the old plan, no such open floor space was available, and 
customers just jammed the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
With the variety of merchandise in the store, the role of textbooks, the 
backbone of the college store operation, has shifted. At USC, the merchandising 
strategy is to use texts -- which students must buy here -- to draw customers 
through the store. Texts are located on the top floor, so to find them, 
students must pass through the general book department on Level 2 (a 
below-ground-level department sells clothing and gifts and has a separate 
outside entrance), swing through professional books, computer equipment and 
office supplies on Level 3, and ride up to textbooks at the top. Along the way, 
arranged in clear plastic display cubes along the escalator banks, are "impulse 
items" -- colorful calendars, office supplies, selected gift items -- that 
managers hope will tempt customers to add a few dollars to their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
An increased emphasis on general books accounts for some of the impulse to 
expand. Although they are the least profitable of the items sold in these 
stores, additional floor space and personnel is being devoted to a range of 
books from faculty publications to best sellers, and even children's books. 
</P>
<P>
"General books are among the slowest sellers, but on a campus, they are one of 
the most important areas for the academic mission of the store," says 
Distelhorst. "Depending on the quality of the bookstore and selection, a 
general book department doesn't have to be unprofitable, but there are other 
reasons for having a big department. It sets a tone." 
</P>
<P>
"It pays to have a great selection of books," Kennedy agrees. "We're finding 
that prospective new faculty visiting the campus will look at the library and 
the bookstore. It weighs in their decision to come to the school." 
</P>
<P>
USC Bookstores director Jack Arnold anticipates that when the bookstore hits 
its stride, there will be 80,000 titles in the general book department -- 
representing a five-fold increase over the old inventory and comparing 
favorably with the figures at large general bookstores. Attention to 
small-press books and California authors is evident in the selection. 
</P>
<P>
The bookstore's relationship to the outside community is still unclear, 
however. According to Arnold, an edge-of-campus site for the new store was 
briefly considered, but rejected in favor of the central location. Parking is a 
major problem for visitors who might want to drop by to browse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual for a college bookstore to aggressively pursue business 
off-campus," Distelhorst says. "The movement is rather in the opposite 
direction. Local businesses feel threatened" by the sense that college stores 
have tax advantages because of their institutional affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
In one particularly high-profile case now before the California Supreme Court, 
two Marin County booksellers sued a national bookstore chain that managed a 
store under contract to a local college; they sought an injunction preventing 
the college store from selling non-required texts. 
</P>
<P>
General book department manager Candace Moreno, on the other hand, takes a 
longer view. "Parking is a problem, but we'll come up with something," she 
says. "Downtown is moving in this direction. It may not be here for another 
decade or so, but you can feel it coming this way. We're going to be in the 
heart of L.A. in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Parking instructions for visitors to the USC Bookstore: Be persistent and 
avoid days when football games are scheduled. Enter the campus through Gate 2, 
located on Figueroa Street just north of Exposition Boulevard. Tell the parking 
attendant you are headed for the bookstore; a number of metered parking spaces 
have been set aside for this purpose.
