Planetariums offer Southern Californians the opportunity to explore the moon, 
the sun, the stars and other celestial landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
"The planetarium is like a zoo, showing you things that don't exist in your 
neighborhood any longer," said John Mosley, program supervisor at Griffith 
Observatory in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A planetarium, he said, lets whoever is operating it "manipulate" the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"From your own back yard, it's pretty static. But in a planetarium, we can 
accelerate time, we can watch the motions of a planet through months and see 
eclipses happen," Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>

following Southland planetariums:
