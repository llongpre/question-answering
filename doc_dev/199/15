<LEADPARA>  More than half the county's bus routes will have service reduced under a plan
expected to be approved today by the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors.;
  Faced with dwindling sales-tax revenues and a budget slashed by 5.3 percent
in August, county officials say the cuts -- affecting 45 of 81 routes next
Jan. 1 -- are necessary to avoid wiping out nearly $60 million in reserves and
going into the red by fiscal 1995.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Individually, nearly every change affects only a handful of riders. But
collectively, hundreds of passengers will find their daily routines
disrupted.;   "Aw, damn," Julia Castillo of San Jose said Monday when told Bus
No. 74 would run less frequently -- every 30 minutes instead of every 15.
Castillo, 27, was waiting at a stop near Capitol Avenue and Hostetter Road
with the two fidgety toddlers for whom she baby-sits.;   "I don't have a car,
so we depend on the bus," Castillo said of their twice-a-month outing to
Eastridge Shopping Center. "All I ask is that I don't wait too long. The kids
can get kind of antsy.";   Over a year, the cuts translate into buses being
driven 85,000 fewer hours and nearly 1.3 million fewer miles. Affected the
most will be:;   (check) Early-morning and late-night riders. Many of the cuts
eliminate buses before 7 a.m. and after 7:30 p.m.;   (check) How often buses
run. Instead of four buses an hour on a particular route, there may be only
two.;   (check) Line No. 14, from downtown San Jose to the housing authority
offices on Julian Street. It's being cut entirely.;   (check) Individual
segments of heavily traveled lines where ridership drops off.;   "This is not
something I prefer to do, because it will certainly inconvenience some
riders," transportation agency director Larry Reuter said. "But it's part of
business we have to do to keep solvent.";   Most of the affected routes
usually carry about a half-dozen riders.;   In many instances, Reuter said,
these lines can be served by other lines or by the light rail.;   In recent
years, operating expenses have risen as the trolley line opened and bus lines
feeding into the trolley were added. But, despite a ticket price rise for both
earlier this month, costs have continued to increase.;   The cutbacks will
save the county $1.9 million for the final six months of the current fiscal
year and about $4 million every year after. Over 10 years, the savings would
approach $48 million.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the bus cutbacks today at 9 a.m. at the
supervisors' chambers, 70 W. Hedding St., San Jose.; Some bus routes affected;
