<LEADPARA>  YOU HAVE probably heard where Caltrans, the people best known for closing
lanes of traffic during peak commute hours, are going to spend $1.4 million to
analyze what we do during an average day.;    A lottery of sorts will pick
thousands of telephone numbers throughout the state. Representatives from
Maritz Marketing Research of Artesia will then phone and try to convince the
person answering that they are not selling vacation land, security systems, or
vinyl siding, but instead conducting a survey on behalf of Caltrans.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Maritz is looking for 15,000 households or about 42,000 people who will
keep a diary of one day's activities. For example: "Up at dawn. Exercise for
30 minutes. Shower in three cups of water. Eat a healthy high-fiber breakfast.
Ride a bicycle to work. Complete task after task in an ergonomically designed
office. Jog during the midday. Eat a well balanced lunch that is followed by
an afternoon of intense productivity. Ride bicycle home. Swim. Eat healthy
dinner. Read. Relax. Exercise. Go to bed.";    The truth is that they are
looking for hints as to how we transport ourselves and where we go during an
average day, contributing in part to a better understanding of our public
transportation needs.;    Since I usually drive to work and then from place to
place, I decided to see how well I could utilize Santa Clara County's Transit
System on a day when I had but two appointments.;    7:45 a.m. Walk
approximately one-half mile to bus stop and take No. 22 line at 8:16 a.m. to
the Mercury News office in Mountain View.;    8:39 a.m. Arrive. Attempt to
look as if I'm doing really important things. I open mail, most of it directed
at a grammatical error I made last week. One reader comments, "I hold
reporters to a higher standard." I do too. That's why I'm a columnist.;   
10:00 a.m. I phone Santa Clara County Transit Information for directions on
how to get from San Antonio Road and El Camino Real in Mountain View to El
Camino Hospital, and then to Stevens Creek and De Anza boulevards in
Cupertino. I take intense notes.;    10:36 I leave for bus stop.;    10:39 I
watch MY bus pass on the opposite side of the street as I wait to cross El
Camino.;    10:50 As advised I board a No. 22 bus eastbound on El Camino
headed for a connection with a No. 51 bus at Miramonte Ave. In a conversation
with the driver, he points out that I catch the No. 51 bus at Castro and El
Camino not at Miramonte.;    10:55 I arrive at Castro and El Camino. A rider
named Wayne shows me a secret way to get to the Castro Street stop -- cut
through the rear parking lot of Home Savings. I then sit on a bus stop bench
next to an old guy holding a can of Budweiser and coughing like a Cuisinart
with bad bearings.;    11:10 Passengers are asked to leave the bus stop by a
man from County Transit who is there to pick up trash and sweep.;    11:15 No.
51 bus arrives and pulls up behind the cleanup man's truck. We're delayed in
leaving because it's time to change drivers and the cleanup man's truck is
blocking the bus. Bus drivers exchange pleasantries until cleanup man
departs.;    11:25 Arrive at El Camino Hospital to drop off one envelope.
TOTAL TIME since leaving for bus stop: 49 minutes to travel about three
miles.;    11:49 Cupertino-bound bus No. 51 arrives. At first stop an elderly
woman approaches the bus wearing a white allergy mask over her nose and mouth.
I suspect a hijacking, which could make me even later for a 12:00 lunch date.;
   12:02 Get off bus at Stelling and Homestead roads in Cupertino to transfer
to a No. 53 bus southbound toward De Anza College.;    12:08 I board the No.
53 bus and the driver advises me to get off at Stevens Creek and walk to De
Anza rather than waiting for the No. 23 bus, recommended by the transit
information service. "You may end up waiting longer for the bus than it takes
to walk," he told me.;    12:11 Begin walking east on Stevens Creek past the
Union Church of Cupertino, past the post office, to Marie Callender's
restaurant.;    12:22 Arrive at Marie Callender's. Group of friends have
already eaten. I have a bowl of soup and inform them that I need to catch my
next bus at 1:04. They howl and spit food and don't believe that I'm riding
the bus.;    1:04 The time I'm supposed to catch a No. 23 bus westbound on
Stevens Creek that will take me directly to San Antonio Road and El Camino.;  
 1:14 p.m. No. 23 bus arrives. It's warm and stuffy. I'm warm and stuffy. Some
seats are littered with read newspapers -- however, it's OK since they are all
copies of the Mercury News.;    1:45 p.m. On the advice of the driver I stay
on board past San Antonio Road and El Camino until the bus stops at the end of
the line: Showers Drive and El Camino. "I think it's a little closer to where
you're going," he said.;    TOTAL time since 1:04 p.m.: 41 minutes to travel
about five miles.;    Exhausted by 4:40, I phone my son for a ride home. If
one of the questions that Caltrans is trying to answer is why the public
doesn't use public transportation more often and why we haul our gas-guzzling
cars to work, the answer might be that most employers tend to frown on what
should be brief trips taking a few hours.  </TEXT>
