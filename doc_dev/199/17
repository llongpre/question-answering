The 185-yard par three fifth hole at Penmar Golf Course in Mar Vista was no 
problem for 74-year-old Richard Shappell of Inglewood recently. With a 
five-wood Shappell recorded the sixth hole in one of his career at the Los 
Angeles County course, according to starter Skip Belden. Two other area golfers 
aced their names into link record books recently. Mike Moreno of Carson holed 
out at Harbor Park's par three fourth hole by dropping a nine-iron onto the 
green and rolling the ball into the cup. And the 128-yard second hole at Los 
Feliz was no match for Harry Kido of Gardena, who dropped a seven iron into the
