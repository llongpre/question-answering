SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS become a haven for much-traveled vintage carousels. A 
ride on a merry-go-round is a thrill for children, and the tinkly music of a 
carousel band organ can evoke childhood summer memories for adults. 
</P>
<P>
The Spillman carousel in Los Angeles' Griffith Park was built in 1926, but some 
of its horses were carved by Charles Looff, the godfather of carousels, before 
the turn of the century. Its fine Stinson Military band organ has a repertoire 
of more than 1,500 tunes.

Charles Looff built the Shoreline Village carousel in Long Beach in 1906. 
Originally located in Seattle, it was moved to San Francisco's Playland in 
1914, where it remained until 1973. Now housed in a replica of Looff's original 
hippodrome, its menagerie of jumping camels, rams, giraffes (and, of course, 
horses) has real horsehair tails and Belgian cut-glass "jewels."

One of the last places you can catch a brass ring is at the carousel at Balboa 
Park in San Diego. The 1910 Herschell-Spillman Co. carousel moved south from 
Los Angeles to settle permanently in Balboa Park in 1922, arriving at its 
present location next to the San Diego Zoo in 1968.

San Diego's Seaport Village is the home of the Broadway Flying Horses, an 1890 
Coney Island William F. Mangles and Charles Looff carousel, originally powered 
by a steam engine. The horses were refurbished by artisans who used automobile 
paints blended in the colors of the original palette. The turn-of-the-century 
Gebruder Bruder Waldkirch band organ has also been restored.

More than 80 years old, the Dentzel carousel, with 52 hand-carved animals, is 
featured at Castle Amusement Park in Riverside. For many years it was located 
at Knott's Berry Farm. Music is provided by a Ruth band organ, which was 
rescued from the old Long Beach Pike. The 1922 carousel on the Santa Monica 
Pier was manufactured by the Philadelphia Toboggan Co., and was made famous in 
the movie "The Sting."
