Time constraints, modern life styles and weather all conspire to deny county 
residents many of the trappings of a traditional Christmas. There are not too 
many sleigh rides to grandma's, for example, when the thermometer lurks around 
70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
But one tradition we can enjoy is cutting a fresh Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has a nice crop of tree farms where either you or the farm staff 
can cut a tree. Some farms provide services such as home delivery, flocking and 
fire-retarding; some provide seasonal treats. Most farms plan to be open until 
Christmas Eve but will close when their stocks are depleted.
