EMERITUS COLLEGE AIDS SENIORS WITH CLASSES AIMED AT RETIREES

Thousands of students went back to school last month, marking America's 
traditional September rite. Young people ranging from big-eyed kindergartners 
to seasoned college seniors made their way through classroom doors. 
</P>
<P>
Those enrolled at Emeritus College in Santa Monica may have a few years on such 
students, but they seem to have as much enthusiasm. About 3,500 Southland 
residents are enrolled in the state-financed adult education program of Santa 
Monica College, sampling from 100 eclectic not-for-credit daytime classes. 
</P>
<P>
Offering courses from Shakespeare and foreign policy to post-stroke exercise 
and instruction in living with hearing loss, Emeritus College has some new 
classes, new ideas and a new home. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1974 by Santa Monica College President Richard Moore, the school has 
just opened its first permanent facility on the renovated Third Street 
Promenade after 14 years of makeshift classrooms in Santa Monica community 
facilities and churches. 
</P>
<P>
School director Maggie Hall says this has brought about a philosophical change 
in the Emeritus program. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past," she said, "we tried not to publicize the program too much 
because we couldn't serve the students -- we didn't have enough locations. But 
this year we decided to seek support from the city of Santa Monica to help us 
grow, and they're paying for a third of the rent for our new buildings. We've 
got 15 new classes, and new faculty members are coming in with excitement and 
energy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transition Period 
</P>
<P>
Emeritus College was designed, Hall said, to ease the transition between work 
and retirement. "People have certain specific life learning needs in later 
years, and education helps them to cope with diminishing physical capacity and 
financial resources. Our prime motive has always been to keep the older adult 
integrated into the community with the mind working." 
</P>
<P>
The program is specifically designed for senior citizens, and although most of 
the students at Emeritus are retired and between 60 and 70 years old, there are 
no age or residence restrictions. Most of the classes are free. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students say the program provides a climate conducive to forming 
friendships. Sylvia Rothschild, past president of the 34-member Emeritus 
advisory board, who has taught a class in autobiography writing for 11 years, 
said: "My students write about themselves and share experiences, and from 
sharing they get to feel close. There have been wonderful relationships formed. 
</P>
<P>
"Emeritus really satisfies a need so many people have for contact. It relieves 
loneliness and makes them feel worthwhile. When you take a class, you feel like 
you're going ahead with your life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like a Family' 
</P>
<P>
Bill Elliott, who leads another class, the 25-member women's Lyric Chorus, 
says: "The group is very close, like a family. It's ethnically diverse, the way 
life should be, with people of every background, and we're all there because we 
love to sing together." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, a former professional choral singer with the Fred Waring and Ray 
Charles singers, took over the group in 1986. It frequently performs for local 
nursing homes, church groups and civic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
He believes the class helps build self-esteem. "I'm trying to show them how 
good they are and that they can step into a more demanding situation," he says. 
"We've just made our first record, and when they heard the playback, one of the 
ladies said, 'Why, we don't sound old.' It was a big moment for them." 
</P>
<P>
Ellie Mae Cramer, 68, veteran of at least 16 classes, ranging from band (she 
plays trombone and baritone sax) to stress management, said: "When my husband 
died I went into a very deep depression, and I would have committed suicide, 
but my college supervisors got me started with classes. Now I can't learn 
enough or get to school often enough, and I'm a different person. I never 
believed there was this much to life." Cramer's new life has also included an 
appearance on a senior citizen segment of KCBS' "Two on the Town." 
</P>
<P>
Rita Bachtold, equally enthusiastic about her auto and home repair classes and 
their teacher, Bonnie Kramer, said: "Her idea is that a woman can do everything 
she sets her mind to." 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely not a playpen thing," said Harold Jaeger, 82, of his 
Emeritus political science classes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Broad Range of People' 
</P>
<P>
"There's participation in classes, and I never cease to be amazed at the depth 
and breadth of experience in the groups," said Jaeger, a retired labor law 
attorney. "We have a broad range of people who were active in fields like 
finance, statecraft and other disciplines, and it makes for an interesting 
exchange of views. 
</P>
<P>
"In regard to getting some of these old fogies up off their duffs and out doing 
things, I think Emeritus contributes to their longevity and desire to continue 
living." 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger is a member of the school's advisory board, which director Hall said has 
always been an important element of the school. "Mostly it's made of community 
senior activists who want to put their opinions into action. They make a lot of 
excellent suggestions, and some of our new classes are a direct result of their 
input," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall interviews and selects the teachers, working with a Santa Monica College 
committee. Teaching applicants must have a bachelor's or master's degree in 
their subject area as well as experience teaching older adults and "a lot of 
enthusiasm and energy." 
</P>
<P>
"They're paid $30 an hour, and we've had several people who've donated their 
salaries back to the college," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage and family counselor Ruth Dasche, an Emeritus teacher for five years, 
is teaching four classes this year, including the popular "Psychodynamics of 
Assertiveness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Positive Changes' 
</P>
<P>
She said: "My students generally want to learn three things: how to demand 
respect from their doctors and nurses, how to say no to their friends, and how 
to ask their children for what they want. They're proud and independent people, 
not used to asking for help, and what they learn from me and each other assists 
them in making positive changes in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Chandler is one instructor who needs no classroom. Now in his 13th year 
of teaching horticulture at Emeritus, his Monday morning class meets in various 
public and private parks and gardens all over Southern California. It is 
popular with young horticulturists and landscape designers as well as seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler, a former UCLA and Los Angeles City College teacher, said, "We have 
some noted garden designers in the class, some of whom began with my course 
before they ever became professionals." 
</P>
<P>
One star member of the class is eucalyptus expert Grace Heintz, 84, the author 
of "Trees of the Pacific Palisades." 
</P>
<P>
Heintz, a former teacher, recalled with a chuckle how she taught herself to 
ride a bicycle at age 65 because it would be easier to ride around town 
cataloguing trees. She makes presentations and identifies specimens for 
botanical gardens and arboretums all over California. "Phil Chandler," she 
says, "has been a godsend -- he's so knowledgeable."
