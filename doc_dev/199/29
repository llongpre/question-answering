METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOARD APPROVES NEW SITE FOR FAIR

<P>
Encouraged by a warm welcome from nearby Lake View Terrace homeowners, the San 
Fernando Valley Fair board voted Friday to move a scaled-down version of the 
annual fair to Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
The location is less than ideal, board members said, because to win consent 
from nearby homeowners and the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, 
they agreed to ban carnival rides, concerts and sale of alcoholic drinks. Those 
were the major money-makers at past fairs. 
</P>
<P>
The fair, scheduled for July 14 to 16, will be restricted to such traditional 
country fair offerings as livestock exhibits, harvest celebrations, banjo 
contests, lumberjack competitions and craft booths. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the fair was ousted from Cal State Northridge after 13 years to 
make way for campus expansion. A tentative agreement to use a 30-acre cornfield 
at Pierce College fell through after Woodland Hills homeowners and the Los 
Angeles Community College District objected, saying the fair did not fit the 
college's master plan.
