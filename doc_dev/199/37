<CAPTION>  Drawing; DRAWING: Special to the Mercury News; BEFORE THE SPLIT -- The College
of Notre Dame is shown here as it appeared in 1876 at its Santa Clara Street
location. In 1920, the college moved to the Ralston estate in Belmont and the
high school relocated to South Second Street in San Jose.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  The idea of high school students striving to win an award for "ladylike
deportment," or snagging a medal for best clothes mending seems almost
ludicrous. But those were among the most coveted honors at Notre Dame High
School when it was young.;   The downtown San Jose school, celebrating its
140th anniversary this fall, has changed radically in some ways from those
early days.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Founded the same year that Santa Clara University and Bellarmine College
Preparatory opened, Notre Dame has altered its course offerings, stopped
taking boarders and long ago dropped awards for mending.;   But some things
haven't changed. It is still committed to a strong academic program, to being
an all-girls school and to instilling values such as integrity and concern for
others.;   The nuns of Notre Dame de Namur, a Belgian order, had intended to
establish a school in San Francisco, but entreaties by Martin Murphy Jr., a
wealthy early settler in the Santa Clara Valley, led them to check out a
southern location in 1851.;   The proximity of Mission Santa Clara, the
planned Santa Clara University and the support of some of the area's richest
men helped the nuns pick San Jose over the more populous city to the north.;  
They quickly began buying property on West Santa Clara Street, the main
thoroughfare to the mission and right on the edge of the acequia, a ditch that
brought water into town.;   And they quickly began getting students, including
some from the huge Murphy clan. By the time school opened in the fall of 1851,
there were 26 boarders and 20 day students, according to an account in "Light
in the Valley," a history of Notre Dame by Sister Mary Dominica McNamee.;  
The numbers grew and by 1852, the end-of-the-year ceremonies drew some 600
people. Within a few years, a college was added.;   Prominent San Francisco
families, their names now commemorated on street signs such as Noe and
Valencia, joined the daughters of early luminaries such as Peter Burnett,
California's first governor, the Sunols and the Castros, and other wealthy
landowners.;   Often, the students' families paid their tuition, room and
board with butchered meat, cheese or other products. Today's students must pay
cash.;   A diverse school from the start -- early students spoke French,
Spanish and English as their native languages -- Notre Dame today serves a
variety of minority groups, including Hispanics, blacks, Asians and
Filipinos.;   While there has been a tradition of Notre Dame students going on
to college, academic awards are more coveted now than the school's highest
honor in the early days -- "the superior class of good conduct," or the
special award for "order and neatness," considered a recommendation for life
as a housewife.;   The nuns, who made up the faculty in the early years, spent
a lot of time buying up property and adding buildings -- the girls' residence
hall, classrooms for the high school and college, a music conservatory, a
science building, the chapel and the convent.;   The high school/college
complex was isolated from Santa Clara Street by a wall, and occupied the
blocks between San Pedro and Santa Teresa streets through to St. John Street.;
  By 1920, the area around the campus was deteriorating and the nuns, sensing
that business expansion in the neighborhood would make their property more
valuable, began investigating other locations.;   When the Ralston estate in
Belmont went on the market, the nuns decided to move the college there along
with a new high school for boarders. The San Jose high school was moved to
South Second Street, where it continues as a girls high school today.;   There
are no plans to open the school to boys.;   "It's been shown through studies
that young women in their teens are very successful in an environment that's
just girls," said Sister Virginia Unger, president of the school.
"Academically, they excel. They have an opportunity for leadership. Their
self-esteem is strengthened."  </TEXT>
