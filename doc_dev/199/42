<LEADPARA>  Because of additional security measures at Candlestick Park, round-trip bus
service to today's 49ers game from six South Bay locations will begin earlier
than previously announced, the Santa Clara County Transportation Agency said
Friday.;    Buses will begin loading 1 1/2 hours ahead of the final departure
times, and each bus will leave for the game as it is filled. Fans are urged to
arrive at the bus stops at least an hour before these final departure times:  </LEADPARA>
