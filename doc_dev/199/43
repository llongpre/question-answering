   They stood on their heads and yodeled. They
smushed marshmallows in their mouths and chanted, ``Chubby bunny,
chubby bunny, chubby bunny.'' They dressed as Uncle Sam and tapped
danced on stilts.
   They were weird. But they had a purpose.
   More than 100 people staged their weirdest acts last week for a
chance to be seen on the big screen with a guy who proudly bills
himself as ``Weird Al.''
   His real name is Al Yankovic, a 27-year-old Southern California
native who hit the big time in 1983 with a song called ``Another
One Rides the Bus.''
   It was his way of laughing at pop culture _ the song is a parody
of the rock group Queen's hit song, ``Another One Bites the Dust.''
He's been laughing his way to the bank ever since.
   Five albumns later, Weird Al is on the radio and video music
stations again laughing at pop culture, this time with ``I'm Fat''
from his ``Even Worse'' albumn. The song and LP is a takeoff on
Michael Jackson's ``I'm Bad'' from the ``Bad'' album.
   ``Most of the songs I do are about food or TV _ two of the
things that have shaped my life most,'' Yankovic said.
   Five years later, Weird Al is still, well, weird. And he's
making a full-length feature film to prove it called ``U H F,'' due
for release next summer. Shooting was to begin in early August in
Tulsa.
   ``It feels kind of cold and clammy,'' said the former college
disc jockey. ``It's a lot harder to be funny for an hour and a half
than it is for three or four minutes,'' he said, referring to his
work with music videos.
   Ten years ago, Yankovic was an architecture student at Cal-Poly
San Louis Obispo College. He left with a degree and moved on to
develop Weird Al. Now he has a movie deal to film the screenplay he
and longtime friend and manager Jay Levey finished in 1983.
   ``The character that I play is going to be somewhat like Weird
Al,'' Yankovic said. ``But this isn't going to be `Weird Al's Big
Adventure.'''
   ``The movie is a cross between `It's a Wonderful Life,' `The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and `Purple Rain,''' said Levey, who is
directing the film. ``It's a love story.''
   OK, not really. Yankovic's character, George Newman, owns a UHF
TV station and turns it into the hottest thing around by putting on
nice, wholesome, weird programming.
   Levey began managing Yankovic's career ``from his inception .. .
when he was an embryo.'' He also has directed the Weird Al videos,
a change of pace from directing ``U H F,'' his first feature film.
   ``I just kind of fell into directing. Shooting music videos is
kamikaze work. You have two days to do four days of work,'' Levey
said. ``The pacing is not quite so deadly in film.''
   The Tulsa auditions were an open call for acts that may be used
later during the eight-week filming schedule when staging a
telethon to save Newman's station, Levey said.
   ``They came at us for five hours. They were all so strange,'' he
said. ``It's hard to describe them without sounding ridiculous. But
they were all great.''
   The movie is being filmed in Tulsa because it's ``the perfect
Anytown,'' Levey said. ``And that's meant as a very affectionate
compliment to Tulsa.''
   Executive producer Gray Frederickson suggested Tulsa as a film
location after his experience here in 1982 while shooting ``The
Outsiders.'' And having a chance to come back home makes working in
the state more desirable, he said.
   ``This is repeat business, so that's great,'' said Mary Nell
Clark, director of the Oklahoma Film Office.
   ``U H F'' is the fourth motion picture filmed in the state this
year. ``The Killing Device'' was filmed in Tulsa in April, ``The
Bounty Hunter'' in Sand Springs in May and portions of ``Rainman''
in Guthrie, Hinton and El Reno in June.
   Clark said she is able to sell the state to film companies
because of the varied location work that is available. ``I always
tell them about the varied terrain. I've hyped that so much now
that I think they believe me.''
   Television, video and full-length feature filming in Oklahoma
brought in about $50 million last year, Clark said.
