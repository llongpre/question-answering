Exasperated with the freeway crawl and with noxious fumes, California voters 
agreed early last month to pay for some transportation relief by raising the 
gas tax. But most commuters ill experience little comfort -- especially working 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Quality Management District's commuter program, for example, neglects 
the needs of workers who must drive their children to school or to child-care 
facilities. The plan asks employers to help reduce drive-alone commutes from 6 
a.m. to 10 a.m. Employers are supposed to reward workers who participate in 
ride-sharing programs, use public transit, agree to a compressed work week or 
reduce drive-alone trips by other means. 
</P>
<P>
Day-care centers unfortunately aren't geared to 10-hour days, four times aweek. 
Car pools and public transit are also less satisfying options for workers who 
are parents. Before catching the bus, a parent must typically drive a short 
distance to take his or her child to the care provider. 
</P>
<P>
Starting a cold engine for a five-mile drive produces 60% of the pollution a 
20-mile trip does, according to the AQMD. A program designed to improve air 
quality by reducing the number of vehicle trips, then, must take into account 
the needs of working parents. Otherwise, its benefits, at best, will be 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that child-care needs have been overlooked as a 
work-related and transportation issue. Today's concept of childhood is quite 
different from the days when father and son, mother and daughter worked 
side-by-side at home. After the Industrial Revolution, families just moved 
closer to the factories. 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of child-labor laws, the wives of men working at the factories 
stayed home with the children, largely remaining there until the 1950s. 
Exceptions were made during the two world wars, when women had to fill factory 
positions left vacant by men in the armed forces. During World War II, 
factories provided excellent child-care centers for workers, but the facilities 
were closed after the men returned from the war. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s, relatives and neighbors took care of the children of working 
parents. But as more and more women entered the work force, fewer neighbors and 
relatives were available. More divorces and escalating living costs were also 
factors driving women into the job market. A growing number of parents began to 
take their children to day-care centers and licensed homes located outside 
their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, 55% of working women had children younger than 6 years of age. A 1988 
study by the California Department of General Services showed that of 2,729 
state employees surveyed, nearly 20% drove their children to or from school or 
day care. Ninety percent of the drivers were women. The trip to the child-care 
provider added, on average, eight miles to the round-trip commute. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that parents did not walk or bicycle their children 
to school or day care. Among parents with children at home, ride-sharing 
dropped one-third; among working women with children, use of public transit 
declined by three-fifths. Because most users of public transit are women, the 
survey results suggest that the ability of buses, light rail and trains to 
solve the state's transportation problems is limited. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, more employers are beginning to offer child-care programs. Los Angeles 
County, for example, provides excellent child care for its employees, 
alleviating many of the worries facing working parents. But it does not take 
their transportation needs into account, since the centers are only located at 
hospitals. Workers assigned to other, sometimes distant county sites must still 
detour to deliver and pick up their children. 
</P>
<P>
Child care at the work site offers employers more than a tremendous recruiting 
advantage. It is also good transportation policy, since the extra miles that 
parents drive to child-care providers would be eliminated. However, the effect 
on ride-sharing programs and the appeal of alternative transportation would be 
minimal. Few parents would take three children on a bus, and a father or mother 
driving three children to the work place would not be among the most popular 
ride-sharing partners. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers, including government agencies, have considered guaranteeing 
ride-sharers and transit users transportation for personal emergencies. They 
have also considered restricting on-site child care to workers who ride-share 
or use alternative transportation. 
</P>
<P>
One emerging child-care strategy could increase use of public transit. Some 
transportation agencies are planning to build child-care facilities at transit 
stations or at park-and-ride lots. Such a facility opened this year on the 
light rail-line of the City of San Diego Metro Transit Authority. In San Jose, 
one is being considered at a point where buses, light rail and commuter trains 
meet. It would include care for mildly ill children, a service working parents 
sorely need. Boston, Atlanta, the Port of New Jersey and the County of San 
Diego are conducting feasibility studies for locating child-facilities care in 
existing transportation centers or along major transportation corridors. 
</P>
<P>
Child-care facilities at residential sites would probably best serve parental 
needs and ease traffic congestion. These centers could organize car pools to 
drive children to neighborhood schools. Parents willing and able to walk, 
bicycle or take a bus to work could eliminate car trips altogether. 
</P>
<P>
By whatever means, transportation-demand managers must make provisions in their 
plans for the growing percentage of workers who require child care. A commuter 
plan that ignores the needs of a large segment of the work force is doomed to 
fall short of its goals of reducing miles driven and number of trips made.
