<LEADPARA>  THE Hoover Institution is presenting a new exhibit that's a good one to see
when you're feeling particularly depressed about the lack of a new world
order.;    The exhibit, in the Hoover Exhibition Pavilion through April 10,
recalls the transformation of Eastern Europe in 1989-90, when the Berlin Wall
came down, elections were held and Hoover researchers were busy gathering as
many documents, posters and mementos as they could carry.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The show includes a hat from the East German army and parts of uniforms
sold openly at flea markets after the fall of the Berlin Wall.;    There are
bumper stickers from the Croation Democratic Union in Yugoslavia, made of the
same silver material that glints into rainbow colors and is popular with
bumper-sticker manufacturers here.;    There's a pinup poster of Vaclav Havel
along with a Polish Solidarity poster depicting the Gary Cooper character from
"High Noon" striding into town holding a Solidarity ballot instead of a
pistol.;    There are fliers appealing for calm in Romania dated the day after
the Ceausescus fell from power. And, added to the display for Lithuania,
there's the notation that in January "the Soviet Union used force to quell the
independence movement.";    The Hoover Pavilion is open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Monday through Friday. The Pavilion is located at the base of Hoover Tower on
the Stanford campus.; The military in concert; And now, back to the U.S.
military.;    The U.S. Navy Band performs tonight at Foothill College. The
concert is free, but vouchers are required to get into the hall. Call the
Foothill Box Office at (415) 948-4444 to get one.;    The U.S. Navy band,
based in Washington, travels through California once every four years. This is
the band's first appearance at Foothill College.;    The band will be joined
by 10 local high school and Foothill College music students. Together, they'll
play a mix of music, including at least one Sousa march ("Glory of the Yankee
Navy," of course), several classical selections and "On a Wonderful Day Like
Today," from the musical "Stop the World, I Want to Get Off." Somehow, that
seems particularly apt.;    The U.S. Navy Band is scheduled to begin its
two-hour concert at 8 tonight at Foothill College, 12345 El Monte Road, Los
Altos Hills.; Gallery on the move; The Photographer's Gallery, for years a
fixture on Ramona Street in Palo Alto, has moved to the area trendoids around
town like to call SoFa, as in South of Forest Avenue.;    The Photographer's
Gallery joins Branner Spangenberg Gallery on Emerson Street, just south of
Forest, with a show of work by Robert Glenn Ketchum.;    Ketchum, who is
represented in most of the major museums in the United States, is an
environmental photographer, and one of the first contemporary photographers to
include overtly political messages in his work. In 1989, the Sierra Club gave
him the Ansel Adams Award for conservation photography.;    Ketchum's work is
displayed through March 30 at the gallery's new location at 732 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto.; Stanford's 'Magic Flute'; (box) Stanford's Department of Music
presents a semi-staged production of Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute" at 8
p.m. today and Friday and at 2:30 p.m. Sunday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
performance will be in English and will feature the Stanford Chamber Orchestra
and Chamber Chorale. Tickets are $8 for general admission and $5 for students
at the door or through the Tresidder Ticket Office, (415) 725-2787.  </TEXT>
