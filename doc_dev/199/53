<DESCRIPT>  CALIFORNIA; SANTA-CRUZ; COLLEGE; TREE; PROTEST  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  At least 38 people, including a television cameraman, were arrested Monday
during all-day protests over a redwood logging operation on a rural section of
the University of California, Santa Cruz campus known as "Elfland.";    Police
from UC campuses at Berkeley and Davis, as well as city officers from Santa
Cruz, were brought in to allow timber crews from Big Creek Lumber to remove
150 second-growth trees.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The persistent, and often scattered, protest from about 75 people centered
on a 14-acre woodland on the north end of campus near McLaughlin Drive.;   
The site is the proposed location of College Nine and Ten, scheduled for
construction next year. Campus planners say the complex will house 2,000
students and will include classrooms for anthropology, economics, education
and psychology studies.;    Monday's demonstration was the flash point after
months of attempts to block the logging. The university has contended that
cutting the trees is vital to its long-range plan of increasing enrollment
from the current 10,000 to 15,000 by 2005.;    "It's been suggested that this
is something akin to a clear-cut," university spokesman Jim Burns said. "It's
not. We're only taking 15 percent of the trees. The buildings will be
integrated tastefully.";    But student groups and some Santa Cruz County
politicians say the plan amounts to desecration of "Elfland," a beloved grove
rich in wildlife, mystical in character and frequented by hikers, mountain
bikers and community members seeking solitude.;    Miriam Sachs, a freshman
with the Coalition to Move College Nine and Ten, called the logging "immoral
and illegal.";    "We are not no-growth," Sachs said. "We understand
California's population is getting bigger. We're just saying that if you build
more housing, it should be well-planned -- and for God's sake it shouldn't be
on a sacred site.";    Protesters, some of whom were not students, assembled
at 7 a.m. and attempted to get around police lines to halt cutting.;    There
were no serious injuries.;    John Torigoe, a cameraman with KSBW-TV (Ch. 8),
suffered cuts and bruises when a Berkeley campus officer grabbed his camera
and threw him to the ground while he was filming in a "restricted" area.;   
Torigoe was arrested, but later released without being booked. University
officials said the incident is under investigation.;    The state Board of
Forestry granted the timber permit two weeks ago after an appeal by Santa Cruz
County supervisors was denied.;    Most logging for College Nine was completed
Monday. The permit allows an additional 18 acres to be cut -- about 100 more
trees -- to make room for College Ten.;    Most of the demonstrators were
arrested on trespassing charges. Several were cited on charges of resisting
arrest and destroying police signs.  </TEXT>
