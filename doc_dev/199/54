<LEADPARA>  Hundreds of bus riders in Palo Alto may have to wait longer or find other
modes of transportation if the county goes ahead with plans to cut service on
certain routes.;   The Santa Clara County Transit District plans to reduce bus
service by about 5 percent by January to help save about $4 million.  </LEADPARA>

PALO ALTO FRETS ABOUT CHANGES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The district is targeting routes and periods of operation that serve the
fewest number of riders. But Palo Alto city officials are concerned the
district's proposals will make bus service inadequate and jar local and
regional efforts to minimize traffic congestion.;   In particular, city
officials are concerned that the proposals will eliminate weekend bus service
in south Palo Alto, and reduce commute service to the Stanford Research Park
and transit connections to the California Avenue CalTrain Station.;   "It
appears the 5 percent reduction is counter to the goal to promote mass
transit," said Gayle Likens, a Palo Alto senior planner. "The two don't mesh
well. And the reduction will affect areas of Palo Alto we have great concerns
about.";   Council members have forwarded their concerns to the county, which
will have a Sept. 25 public hearing on all the proposed route changes. The
County Transportation Commission will make its recommendations Oct. 9. The
Transit District Board of Supervisors will give final approval Oct. 22. All
meetings will be at the County Administration Building, 70 W. Hedding St., San
Jose.;   "In the next couple of years, we foresee that expenditures will rise
above revenues. This is action to head that off a bit," said Mike Aro, service
development manager for the county transportation agency. "We tried to limit
the effect on riders. We think these proposals do that.";   Of the 82 bus
routes operated by the county, 49 are targeted for changes. The following
could affect Palo Alto:;   (check) On Line 24, which provides service from the
Stanford Research Park to CalTrain, all trips detouring to the California
Avenue CalTrain station during commute periods would be eliminated. The last
bus north would leave San Jose at 7:15, not 7:46 p.m.;   Council members
oppose the changes, fearing they would discourage commuting.;   (check) On
Line 88, which provides transportation from the Veterans Administration
Medical Center to California Avenue, midday service would be every 45 minutes,
not 30 minutes, and weekday service after 7 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday
service, would be discontinued.;   (check) On Line 104, which runs from East
San Jose and Milpitas to the Stanford Research Park, the last evening trip at
5:51 p.m. from the research park would be eliminated.;   Council members
oppose the change, because it would cut service for Stanford Research Park
employees.;   (check) On Line 304, from the Stanford Research Park to south
San Jose, reverse commute trips from Palo Alto to San Jose would be
eliminated, as well as the segment of the route between Mountain View CalTrain
station and the Stanford Research Park.;   Council members oppose the changes,
even though ridership is considerably below standard. They believe ridership
could be improved with more promotion.;   (check) On Line 35/35M, which
provides transportation from Stanford University to Foothill College and Menlo
Park to the San Antonio Shopping Center, service before 6 a.m. would be cut,
evening service after 9 p.m. would run hourly rather than every half hour, and
Line 35M trips that operate via Middlefield Road to the Menlo Park CalTrain
Station would be eliminated.;   Council members support the change in evening
service. But they oppose the other proposals.;   (check) On Line 84, which
provides service from the CalTrain station to the San Antonio Shopping Center,
weekday service hours would be limited to 9 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Saturday service
would be halted.;   Council members support the reduction in service on this
route, which has one of the lowest ridership rates in the county.;   (check)
On Line 86, which provides service from the Stanford Shopping Center to the
San Antonio Shopping Center, weekday evening service hours would be reduced
and one early morning northbound trip would be cut. Council members support
the reductions during these hours of low ridership.  </TEXT>
