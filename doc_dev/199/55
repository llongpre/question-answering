<LEADPARA>  RANDOM drug testing for college athletes is a terrible idea. Coaches ought to
be able to tell when kids are on drugs and do something about it. If they
don't, the ones to get physically hurt are the drug users themselves. A
doped-up football player may let his teammates down, but he won't kill them.; 
  Mass transit drivers are different. They control dozens of lives at a time
on a bus, maybe hundreds on a train. The public has a right to expect that
their bus drivers and train engineers are sober and alert. If drivers do
something wrong, they won't just hurt themselves.  </LEADPARA>

RIDERS HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT TRANSIT
DRIVERS DON'T HAVE IMPAIRED SENSES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The new general manager of Santa Clara County's transit district, Lawrence
Reuter, didn't win fans in the drivers' union by suggesting random drug and
alcohol tests for bus and trolley operators. But since August, four bus
drivers have been charged with drunken driving.;    That doesn't mean lots of
other drivers get drunk, but it does mean the system fails to catch problem
drivers. These folks weren't arrested on their way to work; they were stopped
in their buses.;    That's a little late.;    The four were all relief
drivers, who pick up their buses mid-route and don't report to headquarters or
see a supervisor first. Maybe there's a better way to keep tabs on relief
drivers.;    But Reuter says in New York, where he worked before, drivers
showing up at central locations also flunked alcohol tests. You can bluff your
way through a brief stop at the office better than you can an emergency --
say, for instance, a child running into the street in front of your bus.;   
Random drug tests do invade the privacy of law-abiding drivers, but public
safety is the higher concern here. Lives are at stake.;    Reuter should have
the county board of supervisors' support and the union's cooperation on this
one.  </TEXT>
