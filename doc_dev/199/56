4:30 p.m. on Jan. 10. More information is available through school art
departments or from the association at (408) 988-LUNG.; STREET IMPROVEMENT:
Years of cracks and bumps have been mended and smoothed on East Santa Clara
Street between Seventh and 13th streets, a local agency announced early this
month.;   The East Santa Clara Street Revitalization Association Inc. is now
ready to patch up other parts of the main thoroughfare, between North Fourth
Street and Highway 101.;   The new sidewalk pavings run from the middle of the
sidewalk to property lines, with a 42-inch high cement wall built at the
intersection of North 12th and 13th streets, which is to help screen a corner
parking lot.;   The association is a non-profit venture made up of merchants,
property owners and professionals working on Santa Clara Street.;   FUNDING:
The Santa Clara Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Programs is seeking projects to tap
into $60,000 in funds available. The funds, which would go to "Community
Action Stipends" of $500 to $3,000, are for use in projects or activities
supporting youth, family or community group alcohol and drug abuse prevention
programs.;   Any county agency or organization is eligible to apply for funds,
the bureau said in a statement. Information meetings are scheduled throughout
January.;   For more information, call Eimi Okano at (408) 299-8230. The
application deadline is Jan. 24.;   STUDENT HONORS: Twenty-eight students at
Bellarmine College Preparatory school were recognized last month by the
College Board for outstanding results on college-level Advanced Placement (AP)
examinations.;   Five Bellarmine youths received the high-level AP Scholar
With Distinction recognition: Geoffrey Nolan, Daniel Hardy, Michael Ho, David
Rahn and David Smith. The examinations, which students take in May after
completing college prep courses, are graded on a five-point scale, with five
being a high score.;   The Bellarmine students earned distinction by scoring
three or higher. The College Board is a national non-profit organization of
colleges and universities which conducts the tests for college placement.;  
NEW CHIEF: Cmdr. Kathleen M. Lyman, a 15-year Navy officer, has succeeded
Cmdr. Gary G. Mahle as commanding officer of a Navy facility in Sunnyvale
involved with the Trident missile system.;   Lyman took command of the Program
Management Office Strategic Systems Programs in a ceremony last Wednesday at
Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., where the facility is located. She oversees
about 165 people who supervise building sea-launched ballistic missiles for
the Navy.;   Mahle will report to Strategic Systems Programs headquarters in
Washington.;   Lyman came to the Sunnyvale facility in 1989 from the agency's
headquarters as systems engineering branch head, and has headed the
Engineering Division since March 1990.;   A Fordham University graduate, Lyman
holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's degree in teaching
mathematics. She was commissioned an ensign in April 1976 upon graduation from
Officer Candidate School. She taught mathematics at the Naval Academy, served
on the USS Norton Sound, and earned a master's degree in engineering science
from the Naval Postgraduate School in June 1986.;   OPEN SPACE: In yet another
blow to the development plans of the Catholic Church, Cupertino's planning
commission and planning department weighed in last week in favor of preserving
as open space the St. Joseph's Seminary property in the foothills west of
Interstate 280.;   In a unanimous vote, the planning commission made a
preliminary recommendation that the city give open space advocates two years
to raise money to buy the 208 acres from the church and protect it from
development. During that time, no development proposals for the land would be
considered by the city.;   The Diocese of San Jose, which owns the land, and
developer John Sobrato Sr. are pitching a plan to build hundreds of luxury
homes at the site, located along Interstate 280 west of Foothill Boulevard.
Church officials say they need the money from development to finance many
important programs in the region.  </TEXT>
