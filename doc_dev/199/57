An appeals court judge late Thursday overturned an order by a Superior Court 
judge that banned the sale of Christmas trees on the Pierce College campus in 
Woodland Hills, paving the way for Joe Cicero to reopen his tree lot today or 
Saturday, said Cicero's lawyer, Harold Kippen. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles was a victory for 
the Ciceros, a San Fernando Valley farm family locked in a legal struggle with 
a large tree-selling chain that operates a sales lot across the street from the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Miller, owner of Miller &amp; Sons, which operates more than 40 lots 
statewide, brought legal action to block the Ciceros from selling trees, saying 
he was illegally denied the right to bid on the campus location, which is 
public land. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community College District, faced with a lawsuit by Miller, on 
Monday obtained a restraining order against Cicero from Superior Court Judge 
Dzintra I. Janavs. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero "is really very happy," Kippen said. "If the order had not been stayed, 
it would have bankrupted him. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero had protested that he had already ordered about $150,000 worth of trees 
when the order was issued. He said his $22,000 profit on tree sales last year 
was all that kept afloat the 15-acre farm he leases on the college campus, the 
last remnant of a landmark Valley agricultural operation.
