South County Safe-Rides, a student-run program aimed at combatting teen-age 
drinking and driving, will be launched next month at Capistrano by the Sea 
Hospital in Dana Point. Established and maintained under the auspices of the 
Exploring Division of the Boy Scouts of America, the program provides safe and 
confidential rides home to fellow students who have been drinking or riding 
with someone who has. 
</P>
<P>
Safe-Rides in no way advocates teen-age alcohol consumption, its sponsors 
stress, but it is aimed at reducing tragedies because of drunk driving, 
according to Hal Day, chief executive officer of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Feb. 3, Capistrano by the Sea will be the base of operations for 
Safe-Rides every Friday and Saturday night from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. "Adult 
volunteers who have completed a training session are on site to oversee the 
activities," Day said 
</P>
<P>
Students on each participating high school campus have formed a Safe-Rides club 
to inform other students about the dangers of alcohol and other substance 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It is this positive peer pressure that makes it easier for a teen-ager to 
refuse a drink or avoid riding with someone who has been drinking, without fear 
of criticism," Day added. 
</P>
<P>
Students at San Clemente, Dana Hills and St. Margaret high schools have begun a 
mass distribution of wallet-size cards and key chains with the South County 
Safe-Rides phone number -- (714) 83-ALIVE. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age and adult volunteers are prepared for duty by having completed a 
4-hour training program directed by the Boy Scouts, which includes 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, emergency procedures, alcohol awareness 
and communication skills. An emphasis on confidentiality is designed to ensure 
the trust of fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
One of more than 650 such programs established nationwide by the Boy Scouts, 
the South County Safe-Rides actually began 10 months ago at San Clemente High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano by the Sea Hospital is an inpatient psychiatric hospital affiliated 
with the UC Irvine College of Medicine.
