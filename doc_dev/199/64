   The more things change, the more this tiny
town wants to remain the same.
   That means the kind of place where people live in old school
buses or build homes as the spirt moves them. A place where the
town building inspector can take a six-month leave of absence to
help a peace group build a school in El Salvador. Where volunteers
give away bread on Fridays. Where most of the roads are dirt. Where
most of the residents like them that way.
   ``This is a town of rugged individualists who came here because
we wanted to be free to be ourselves,'' said Prudence Smith, a
member of the five-person town planning board.
   And so they are, a happy melange of young and old, of machinists
and musicians, college professors and farmers, sewage workers and
aging hippies.
   Isolated and poor, with no services to speak of and no intention
of adding any, Wendell has always attracted its share of
truthseekers.
   Mormon Hollow, marked by a tiny cemetery on the north side of
town, is named for travelers who left a 19th-century religious
caravan and settled here. In the 1960s and 1970s, Wendell became a
haven for back-to-the-landers and flower children from the
University of Massachusetts and the other colleges clustered around
Amherst, 30 miles away.
   ``Not only are some of my best friends hippies, but some of our
best selectmen have been hippies,'' said Selectman Ted Lewis, not a
hippie himself.
   But Wendell appeared to be falling victim to its own popularity,
with the population more than doubling to 830 in 20 years. The
problem facing children of the '60s in the 1990s was how they could
all stay in Wendell and still retain the town spirit that attracted
them there in the first place.
   ``For a long time, our poverty and isolation protected us, but
no longer,'' Smith said. ``The cost of living, even here, has
increased to the point where it is becoming difficult for a lot of
people.''
   So townsfolk held a seven-hour ``visioning workshop'' in which
they wrote down, illustrated and debated things the town could use,
such as a tool collective to share such homeowner necessities as
mowers, chainsaws, grass clippers and ladders. They drew up lists
of ``Places of the Heart,'' or landmarks, they wanted to protect,
ranging from the Town Common to a heron rookery.
   Some changes came quickly. A volunteer committee, called the
``Star Riders,'' was formed to offer others rides into town, the
result of a discussion about the lack of public transit.
   With a $20,000 state grant, residents hired a small, local
consulting firm to help draw up a master plan, the centerpiece of
which is the proposed ``Wendell Works'' - a town-sponsored
commercial organic farm and spinoff cottage industries. In a
typically casual way, there is no estimated time of completion.
   ``People don't have much opportunity to spend money in
Wendell,'' said Smith, noting that the town's commercial
development is limited to two general stores, an egg farm and an
auto salvage yard.
   The fruit and vegetables produced by the farm could be sold by
subscription to residents, who would pay in advance for a share of
the crop when it ripened, she said.
   Wendellites want to expand the operation beyond produce into
baked goods, milk deliveries, firewood sales and other farm-related
businesses.
   ``It wouldn't add a lot of property to the tax rolls,'' Smith
said. ``But if we had a soy dairy that would just satisfy the
town's own needs, it would be a way to recycle Wendell money in
Wendell and make it easier for individuals to come up with the cash
flow they need to make it here.''
   And it would fit Wendell's tradition of doing its own thing.
   This, after all, is a town that boasts its own troupe of African
dancers and drummers, and a centrally located Free Box where
residents are encouraged to take what they need and leave what they
can spare.
   Once a month, Town Hall becomes the Full Moon Coffeehouse for
performances benefiting causes from tax resistance to a group that
opposed state surveillance flights to ferret out marijuana growers.
   All this doesn't necessarily make an impression on folks who
grew up in Wendell.
   ``There's nothing new with the younger people,'' said Raymond
Avery, a 72-year-old native. ``Actually, they have less sense of
individuality than the older folks.''
