AGENCY CELEBRATES 10TH: Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County celebrates
its 10th anniversary this year as an independent social service, with a
campaign theme of "Miracles Do Happen.";    Non-sectarian in scope, the agency
serves more than 56,000 local residents annually with 19 programs at 11
sites.;    Originally known as Catholic Social Services, the agency was first
organized in San Francisco in 1921 to serve Santa Clara County, which was then
part of the archdiocese of that city. When the San Jose diocese was formed in
1981, the agency became what it describes as "the social arm of its bishop."; 
  In the early days, with a $14,000 budget, Catholic Charities was a service
for unwed mothers with children in the juvenile court system. It now has an
annual budget of $7 million, a paid staff of 133 and a corps of 900
volunteers. The agency's programs range from mental health and senior services
to housing, immigration and refugee services.;    RIDERS MEET: Quicksilver
