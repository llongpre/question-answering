   Kristen Knouse doesn't think there's
anything special about a blind person riding a horse in a national
college equestrian competition. But she had to fight for a chance
to prove that.
   The blind Rutgers University student has been riding horses,
using her sense of hearing to guide her, since she was 10 years old.
   ``It's easy. I can hear the horse's feet echo off the rail,''
Miss Knouse, 19, said in a telephone interview Sunday from her
hotel room in Laurinburg, site of Sunday's 15th Intercollegiate
National Championship Horse Show.
   Later in the day, she placed fourth out of 12 riders in the
walk-trot equitation class.
   A day earlier, the freshman persuaded organizers to reverse
their earlier decision and let her compete.
   Although she qualified for the competition by winning a regional
collegiate contest last month in Horsham, Pa., organizers last week
disqualified her from the national show, saying a blind rider could
be dangerous to other riders.
   The ruling surprised Miss Knouse, who has competed for two
semesters on the Rutgers equestrian team.
   ``You see, I've never been kept out of anything before _ not
even when I was a kid,'' she said.
   She competes in a type of riding called ``hunt seat,'' in which
riders in traditional English-style attire demonstrate various
gaits as they go around the show ring and are judged on their form.
She said she's tried her hand at jumping, but only in practice
sessions.
   The disqualification also surprised her parents and teammates on
the Rutgers equestrian squad, who accompanied her to North Carolina
on Friday to protest the ruling.
   The North Carolina branch of American Civil Liberties Union also
came to her aid, calling the disqualification discriminatory.
   An attorney for the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association said
the initial decision to disqualify Miss Knouse was based primarily
on insurance concerns and the safety of other riders.
   ``Discrimination is not at issue,'' said attorney John MacCrate.
   About 260 riders from colleges around the United States competed
Saturday and Sunday in the event at St. Andrews Presbyterian
College.
   Miss Knouse, from Medford, N.J., said she usually competes with
``spotters,'' people posted around the horse show ring to warn her
of corners and obstacles.
   Show officials ruled Thursday that the spotters violated
competition rules, while Miss Knouse's riding without them might
endanger other riders.
   But on Saturday, after putting Miss Knouse and her mount through
paces in a private corral at the horse show farm, the show
officials relented.
   They decided to let a friend of Miss Krouse run alongside her
while she rode in the show ring in the walk-trot class, but without
any verbal communication between horsewoman and helper.
   ``She certainly is comfortable on a horse. It went very, very
smoothly yesterday,'' said Shelby French, who owns the farm where
the show was held and coaches the equestrian team at St. Andrews.
   Miss Knouse, who has been blind since birth, said she mounted
her first horse at age 10 at a riding academy near her home. She
quickly adjusted to the different gaits, while her sense of hearing
and the riding instructor helped her guide the animal.
   Later, she practiced on the family horse, Rhannon, riding at
home in a large circle at the end of a long rope held by her father.
   ``I know Rhannon's gaits really well,'' she said. ``But I've
ridden strange horses so many times.''
   William Simpson, an attorney for the ACLU in North Carolina,
said he was glad show officials finally recognized Miss Knouse's
rights.
   ``At first, like most people, they just didn't see how she could
do it,'' Simpson said. ``But I think a fair evaluation with a
sensitivity to her efforts to overcome her blindness was all she
ever asked for.''
