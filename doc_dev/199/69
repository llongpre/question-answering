<LEADPARA>  IF THE go-go '80s taught us it was OK to be rich, the oh-no '90s are teaching
us it's OK to be not-so-rich.;   Conspicuous consumption is out. Being a
downright skinflint isn't exactly in, but at least people are more
understanding about it than they used to be. After all, show us somebody who's
still throwing his or her money around and we'll show you somebody who is
keeping the U.S. economy afloat single-handedly.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     As for the rest of us, things have gotten so tight that we're no longer
looking for cheap thrills, we're looking for free thrills.;   Do they exist?
Well, yes. After a fashion.;   For example, chances are you aren't going to
see the San Francisco Opera for free. But you can see the West Bay Opera for
free. Axl Rose probably won't send you backstage passes for the next Guns N'
Roses show. But you can see some local bands at local clubs absolutely
gratis.;   So let's not hear any more whining about the high price of
entertainment. Instead, let's begin cultivating an almost unattractive desire
to See It Free. Here are 50 freebies to get you started. You can put those
credit cards away.;   Frugality and; the fine arts;   At local colleges and
universities, music and drama departments will front you concert and theater
tickets. The productions are student, not professional, but the price can't be
beat.;   1. During the school year, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music,
19th Avenue at Ortega Street, has free student concerts almost every night in
Hellman Hall. Call the recorded hot-line at (415) 759-3477.;   2. At Stanford
University, free student concerts are given several times a month in Campbell
Recital Hall. For recorded information, call (415) 723-2720.;   3. Music
students and faculty at San Jose State University give recitals every Thursday
at 12:30 p.m. in the music building. Call (408) 924-4673 to get on the concert
mailing list.;   4. The Theatre Arts Department at San Jose State gives free
performances several times a semester. The next is "Holy Ghosts" at 12:30 p.m.
Nov. 12 and 4:30 p.m. Nov. 13 in Hugh Gillis Hall on the corner of 5th Street
and San Fernando. (408) 924-4530.;   5. UC-Berkeley's Zellerbach Players,
consisting of dramatic-arts students, usually produce three or four plays a
semester in the Durham Studio Theatre on campus. (510) 642-1677.;   6. The
oldest continuously maintained municipal band in the country, the Golden Gate
Park Band, performs every Sunday at 1 p.m., weather permitting, in the music
concourse at Golden Gate Park.;   7. West Bay Opera, Palo Alto's opera
company, performs selections from upcoming performances on Thursdays before
opening nights. The next show is scheduled for 8 p.m. Feb. 7 in the Palo Alto
Cultural Center, 1313 Newell Road.;   Live music; -- no cover;   This is dicey
territory for the truly cheap. Purists will argue that the music isn't free,
since you'll be buying drinks. And club schedules can change rapidly. Drop a
quarter and call first to make sure. And call your favorite club, too. The
list below is just to get you started.;   8. At the Saddle Rack, 1310 Auzerais
Ave., San Jose, they'll let you in for free, teach you how to dance (from 7:30
to 9 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) and even feed you free spaghetti
(Tuesday after dance lessons). Never a cover except when national touring acts
blow into town. (408) 286-3393.;    9. They've got the blues at the Hard Disk
Blues Saloon, 1214 Apollo Way, Sunnyvale, and no wonder. No cover Sunday
through Thursday nights. Shows start at 9:30 p.m. (408) 733-2001.;    10. At
J.J.'s Blues Downtown, 14 S. Second St., San Jose, the newest of the three
clubs run by Max and June Stanley, there's no cover for shows starting at 9
p.m. Monday through Thursday, and for early shows beginning at 4:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday. Beginning at 5 p.m. Sunday, the downtown club has
no-cover Dixieland jazz. (408) 286-3066.;    11. Number One Broadway, 102b S.
Santa Cruz Ave., Los Gatos, doesn't have a cover charge Sunday through
Wednesday nights. Shows start at 9 p.m. (408) 354-4303.;    12. For the

has home-grown folk music seven nights a week beginning at 8 p.m. (415)
329-1727.;    13. The Oasis, 200 N. 1st St., San Jose, lets in rock 'n'
rollers for free before 9 p.m., or any time if you've got a green card or a
valid student I.D. (408) 292-2212.;    14. Now for two in San Francisco: the
I-Beam, 1748 Haight St., often has free shows on Tuesday and Thursday nights.
Music starts at 10 p.m. (415) 668-6006.;    15. The Paradise Lounge, 1501
Folsom St., usually doesn't have a cover on Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Acoustic music on the upstairs stage starts at 9 p.m. Electric music on the
downstairs stages starts at 10 p.m. (415) 861-6906.;   Into the; great
outdoors;   And you thought they were always free. Not if you want special
programs.;   16. At the Palo Alto Baylands, east end of Embarcadero Road, the
schedule of walks and programs changes week to week, but you can count on a
walk leaving from the Lucy Evans Interpretive Center at 3 p.m. Saturday and
Sunday. (415) 329-2506.;    17. Rangers give guided tours of the Pescadero
Marsh at 10:30 a.m. Saturday and 1 p.m. Sunday, weather permitting. Meet on
the north side of Pescadero Road at the intersection with Highway 1, 14.5
miles south of Half Moon Bay.;    18. Staff members at the San Francisco Bay
National Wildlife Refuge lead everything from canoe trips to tours of a ghost
town each week, usually leaving from the interpretive center at the east end
of the Dumbarton Bridge, off Thornton Avenue, Fremont. Call (510) 792-0222 for
more information.;    19. If you've got young children, the Sunol Regional
Wilderness has a program for you. The visitor's center is on Geary Road (off
Calaveras Road), about six miles south of I-680. (510) 862-2244.;    20. The
Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center, 4901 Breakwater Ave., is similarly
oriented toward families. "Nature Detectives" is a program for
3-to-5-year-olds. "Marsh Muckers" takes care of the 6-to-8-year-olds. Parents
don't get a cool name, they're just invited to go on bird-watching walks.
(415) 881-6751.;    21. The Golden Gate National Recreation Area sponsors so
many programs, it deserves three freebie listings. First, there's the Maritime
Museum, one of the best in the country and absolutely free (although, like
other free museums, they wouldn't turn down a donation). The museum, on Beach
Street at the foot of Polk Street, San Francisco, includes three historic
ships, which you can board for a small fee. Admission to the ships is free on
the first Tuesday of the month. (415) 556-3002.;    22. The recreation area
includes the San Francisco Presidio, and rangers and volunteers give 20 walks
a month on its historic grounds. One you can count on is the Main Post Walk,
from 10 a.m. to noon Saturday and Sunday. Meet at the main post flagpole,
Arguello Boulevard and Moraga Avenue. (415) 556-0865.;   23. Finally, in Marin
County, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area manages Hawk Hill, where
volunteers are stationed through the fall to count the thousands of raptors
that fly over the Golden Gate bridge during migration. The hill is off
Conzelman Road, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge. (415) 331-0730.;   24.
Don't go in for organized fun? The money-strapped state has instituted day-use
fees at many of its beaches, but some along the San Mateo County Coast remain
free. Try Montara State Beach, Bean Hollow Beach or Gazos Creek Beach. (415)
726-6203.;   Open doors; at museums;   Most museums will let you in for free
at least one day a month. And don't forget private galleries, which are always
free.;   25. The San Jose Museum of Art, 110 S. Market St., has free day every
Thursday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Audio-taped tours of exhibitions are free, as are
docent tours. The museum also sponsors free community receptions with artists.

Park.;   31. The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, 1342 Naglee Ave., San Jose has
free admission from 9 to 11 a.m. Saturday and Sunday. Ask about the Tomb
Tour.;   32. The Triton Museum of Art, 1505 Warburton, Santa Clara, is free
all the time. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, until 9 p.m.
Tuesday, and noon to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.;   33. The DeSaisset Museum,

Tuesday through Sunday.;   34. Also free: the Stanford Art Gallery, near

celebrates its first anniversary with free admission from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. today
and 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday-Sunday.;   Been there, done; that, for free;   37.
 Your public library is a veritable wonderland of freebies. Local libraries
offer free story-times for kids, free book discussion groups, free readings by
authors. Call your local library and the staff will be happy to tell you more.
End of public-service announcement.;   38. Bookstores also are havens for
lovers of the literary life. When authors come through on tour, at least three
local stores are likely to get them to read from their works: Kepler's Books,
1010 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, (415) 324-4321; Printer's Inc., 310
California Avenue, Palo Alto, (415) 327-6500; A Clean, Well-Lighted Place for
Books, 21271 Stevens Creek Boulevard, Cupertino, (408) 255-7600.;   39. Entire
platoons of guides make their living giving specialized tours of San
Francisco. But there are guide platoons that do it for free, too. City Guides
Tours of San Francisco, staffed by volunteers, gives 16 tours on a regular
basis, all free. The tours include North Beach, Nob Hill, Pacific Heights
Victorians and 13 more. (415) 557-4266.;   40. Meanwhile, there's a whole
subset of volunteers who give guided walks through Golden Gate Park. The free
walks to undiscovered park pockets take place on weekends from May through
October. Call (415) 221-1311 for recorded information.;   41. Oakland also has
a series of six guided city tours. Alas, they also run only through October.
They'll start up again in May, and guides will plan special group tours during
the winter for a small fee. (510) 273-3234.;    42. Back home in San Jose,
there are no guided tours, but there is a self-guided, historical walking tour
available from the San Jose Convention and Visitors Bureau Information Center,
150 W. San Carlos St. The center's open 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through
Friday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. (408) 295-9600.;   43. Tours
of our corporate neighbors are great freebies -- especially because you often
get a gift along with the tour. Roll through the Hershey's USA chocolate
factory, and at the end you're rewarded with a chocolate bar of your choice.
Tours take place on a first-come, first-served basis 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Monday through Friday. The factory's visitors center is on the corner of
Highway 120 and G Street in Oakdale. Call (209) 848-5100 for recorded
directions.;   44. Did you know that Eugene O'Neill, arguably the nation's
greatest playwright, lived in Danville? No wonder his work is so depressing.
(Oh come on, Danville. It's a joke.) O'Neill's home, Tao House, is now a
national historic site. Tours, which last 2 1/2 hours, are given at 10 a.m.
and 12:30 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday at 1000 Kuss Road, Danville.
Reservations are required. Call (510) 838-0249.;   45. On those days when
everything in your life seems haywire, go to the temple of the handy and
well-organized. Sunset Magazine guides give tours of the Menlo Park mother
hutch at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Groups of 15 or more
must make reservations. The rest of you gather quietly in the lobby of the
Sunset building on the corner of Middlefield and Willow Roads. (415)
321-3600.;   46. More tranquillity awaits at the grounds of the Carmelite
Monastery, 1000 Lincoln St., Santa Clara. They're open to the public from 7:15
a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and you can enter the chapel, too. (408) 296-8412.;   47.
Even more tranquillity can be found at various local wineries. The Santa Clara
Valley Wine Growers Association will send you a guide to local wineries if you
send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to P.O. Box 1192, Morgan Hill, 95037.;
   48. The Lindsay Museum receives more than 9,000 injured or orphaned wild
animals a year, and manages to return about 40 percent of them to the wild.
It's also a natural history museum, with native California animals living on
the grounds. It's open from 1 to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday in Larkey
Park, 1901 First St., Walnut Creek. (510) 935-1978.;   49. The Foothill
Observatory lets you gaze at the stars through a 16-inch reflecting telescope
from 8:30 to 11 p.m. each clear Friday night. You can return Saturday morning
from 10 a.m. to noon to view solar activity. The observatory (on the Foothill
College campus, 12345 El Monte Road, Los Altos Hills) is closed when it's
cloudy. For directions, call (415) 949-7334.;   50. For free entertainment,
it's hard to beat staking out a bench in the shade and simply gazing at
whatever walks by. The best place to do it? The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk,
where admission is absolutely free (the rides require tickets) and the
people-watching is absolutely astounding. You've never seen so much bare skin
and so many tattoos in one place. Even in winter. The Boardwalk, on the main
beach in Santa Cruz, is open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and Sunday during the
fall and winter and daily during the summer. (408) 426-7433.  </TEXT>
