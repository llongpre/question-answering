   Everybody knows it's tough to take New Yorkers for a ride.
   It isn't so tough when the ride is free.

   On Thursday and Friday evenings, New Yorkers can be seen
boarding a school bus painted Day-Glo green at the World
Financial Center in downtown Manhattan. They are transported
-- without charge -- to four uptown locations. The service is
provided by New York entrepreneur and saloon keeper Jim
Goldman, whose bars happen to be at the bus's uptown
destinations.
   The bus spends most of the night shuttling between Mr.
Goldman's four establishments. (It also runs on Saturdays but
without the downtown service.) Mr. Goldman says he provides
the service to make sure his patrons don't drink and drive.
But he concedes that most Manhattanites don't drive anyway
and that the bus is a clever way to get people to one of his
places.
   Mr. Goldman says the bus costs him $160,000 a year to run,
mainly to cover insurance, and is a cheap way to advertise.
Judging by the instant attention the bus's 450-watt speakers
-- blaring Chicago blues and California beach tunes -- get in
some of New York's upscale neighborhoods, Mr. Goldman seems
to be on to something.
   On the bus one recent evening is a Japanese journalist,
who wears a white safari suit and safari hat and dances
wildly with other passengers. (Dancing is encouraged.) There
also are plenty of post-college professionals high on
alcoholic specialties like a "Dr. Pepper" (made by dropping a
shot glass of flaming rum into a mug of beer).
   For the 30 or so passengers on this ride there is a bus
"cruise" director distributing Hawaiian leis, a bouncer
checking ID's and, yes, a driver, who stoically keeps the bus
moving through traffic despite all the madness around him.
   Bar busing is an import to New York. Mr. Goldman, although
a native New Yorker, says he got the idea for the bus while
living in Chicago.
   Many of his bus passengers say the service puts them in
mind of more relaxed places than New York. "It reminds me of
what they would do while I was in college in Ann Arbor," says
Louise Merriman, a former Michigan resident who currently
lives on New York's Upper East Side and who on this evening
has been at a Goldman bar named Manny's Carwash.
   Ms. Merriman also seems to have found a way to integrate
the bus into her adopted New York life style: She says she is
riding it home instead of paying for a cab.
