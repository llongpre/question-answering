<TEXT>     Now, the question is: Will people use them?;    "It's really kind of a
crapshoot in a way -- because we don't know how many people are going to use
it," said Bruce Kosanovic, public information officer for the Santa Clara
County Transportation Agency. "And the reason we don't know is because they
are generally people that haven't used mass transit before.";    The south end
of the $550 million light-rail line will open at 6 tonight with fireworks and
all the hoopla county and city officials have been storing up since the
project's inception 18 years ago.;    Transportation officials are hoping the
10-mile stretch will increase ridership along the 20-mile corridor from its
current 11,000 passengers each day to more than 20,000 by summer. And they're
crossing their fingers for 40,000 a day by 1996, close to their original
projections. Some residents in the deep south of San Jose consider the light
rail a savior. Last weekend, San Jose City Councilman Joe Head's office
sponsored a preview train ride from the new Almaden station -- and 430 people
showed up.;    "The response was incredible," Head said.;    The reason is
simple. By car, there are basically two ways in and out of South San Jose --
Almaden Expressway and Camden Avenue. During peak commute hours, it's a mess.
It's not unusual for Almaden Valley commuters to spend more than 40 minutes on
the 10-mile stretch to downtown San Jose. Another 2,000 homes will be built by
the end of the decade, adding to the crush.;    But the trip on the 55 mph
trolley from the Almaden station to the convention center will take 19
minutes. Add 10 minutes and you're at the Civic Center.;    "It's a great way
to show my kids that there are other ways to get around besides cars," said
Kate Harness, a Blossom Valley resident who was shopping at Oakridge Mall
Monday with her two sons. "We could ride our bikes to the station and go from
there.";    It's been a few years since downtown San Jose was torn apart for
construction of the downtown transit mall. Residents have seen the light rail
line open in segments -- the first ran through a business area with more than
6 million square feet of empty buildings.;    In its first few months of
operation, the line could barely entice 500 riders a day. Of several rail
systems that have opened in recent years, none has drawn so few riders
initially.;    And, except for Miami's, which is thought to be a colossal
failure, no other system had featured an opening segment that didn't include a
major destination where many people want to go.;    Atlanta, for instance, ran
the initial segment of its BART-like system from a residential area into part
of downtown. Buffalo, N.Y., chose to start its light-rail system downtown but
it reached the near-in suburbs. When Pittsburgh started a top-to-bottom
overhaul of part of its streetcar system, it sent its first segment to a major
shopping area. Sacramento and Portland, Ore., both ran lines from residential
areas to their downtown areas.;    What may be the saving grace for the Santa
Clara County light rail's south end is that Highways 85 and 87 -- with the
exception of a small part of Highway 85 in Blossom Valley -- won't be open for
at least two more years.;    This, officials hope, will get people into mass
transit -- and off the freeways.;    "If the freeway were to open first, you
would have to lure them off the freeway," Councilman Head said. "So that's one
big point in our favor.";    Still, city and county officials know it will
take some coaxing to get people to ride the rails.;    "What we're going to do
now is bend over backward to encourage people to use our transportation system
so they can realize how easy it is," said Rod Diridon, considered the
light-rail czar of Santa Clara County.;    The real test may be whether
Almaden residents have the patience to deal with the Almaden station, which
will be serviced by light rail shuttles.;    For some reason -- no one really
knows why -- the Almaden station was designed to have only one track, rather
than one track in each direction, like all the other stations. So riders will
have to get on a trolley, go north three minutes to the next stop --
Ohlone/Chynoweth -- and board either a northbound or southbound train from
there.;    Adult fares for the light rail are 75 cents each way during commute
hours -- from 6 to 9 a.m. and after 3 p.m., and 25 cents between 9 a.m. and 3
p.m. The fare for children under 17 and seniors is 25 cents at all times.;   
Beginning Friday, there will be three trains each during the morning and
afternoon commute times that won't require Almaden station passengers to
transfer.;    "If the experience with the shuttle is that passengers get on at
Almaden and only have to wait two minutes at Chynoweth -- which is what they
claim -- I think it will work," Head said. "But if passengers have to wait
very long between trains, the shuttle system isn't going to work.";    But
residents who are sick of sitting in traffic say they are willing to give it a
shot.;    "Hopefully, this will mean I can leave my car at home now, although
I still have to work out the bus route," said Madson Green, a self-employed
businessman who works downtown. Green, who lives in the Santa Teresa area,
said he will probably use the park-and-ride lot located off Cottle Road.;   
And even people who won't use the light rail for commuting are looking forward
to using it just for fun.;    "I can't really believe that it's here, but I do
intend to use it," said Cory Rod of Almaden Valley. "I don't go downtown all
that much, but now, maybe I will.";  LIGHT RAIL'S GRAND OPENING; Santa Clara
County's light rail finally will reach where people live tonight when its new,
10-mile southern extension is inaugurated. Activities at the Ohlone/Chynoweth
station, located at Chynoweth and Pearl Avenues, include:; (box)6 p.m. --
Opening festivities with performances by the Oak Grove High School Jazz Band,
a Mexican Folklore group and the San Jose State University Pep Band. Food
vendors will sell popcorn and hot dogs.; (box)7:30 p.m. -- Formal opening
ceremonies, including remarks by Santa Clara County Supervisor Rod Diridon.;
(box)8:30 p.m. -- Fireworks display followed by an inaugural train ride.;
(box)Free train rides northbound or southbound for the remainder of the
evening until midnight, continuing through the weekend. Regular fares (75
cents for adults and 25 cents for children under 17 during peak hours) begin
Monday.; Source: Santa Clara County Transportation Agency  </TEXT>
