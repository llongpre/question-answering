Choosing which traffic school to attend in Ventura County could drive you 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Scenario: You're a Ventura County resident minding your own business, doing 
nothing more than 75 m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. zone, and they give you a traffic 
citation within the county. Fortunately, this is your first offense in a long 
time and you are eligible to attend traffic school to keep those insurance 
premiums down. 
</P>
<P>
Aren't you lucky! There are about 55 classrooms being operated by 17 
DMV-approved traffic violator schools in Ventura County. Fees vary from $18.99 
to $30, with day, evening and weekend sessions available. And what a variety of 
classes to choose from. There are the three community colleges, May Co., 
Comediane Plus-Learn From Us, California Traffic Schools, Lunch N Learn at Fine 
Restaurants, Cheap School, and Tri-County Traffic School, among others. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, if you live in and were ticketed in Ventura County, there won't 
be any jugglers, hay rides, comedians or gourmet lunches in your future. With 
rare exceptions, all eligible violators opting for classes must attend 
Tri-County Traffic School. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ventura County residents ticketed outside the county may 
attend any state-licensed traffic school in California. Non-residents of the 
county have the same option, regardless of where in California the citation was 
received. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid problems. Read the explanation on your ticket or that courtesy notice 
that is generally mailed by the court. If you attend the wrong school, the 
court will not accept the certificate. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, a driver's insurance rates are usually increased if the fine is 
paid without traffic school, but that doesn't mean that completion of traffic 
school wipes the offending ticket off your record. It goes as an 'explained 
citation,' on their record," said Melody Jorgenson, office manager of 
Tri-County Traffic School. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-County is the only nonprofit, as well as the first and oldest traffic 
school in Ventura County. Originally named the "Conejo Valley Traffic Survival 
School," it was established in 1974 in Thousand Oaks by the Jaycees as a 
community service. The school is operated by paid coordinator Lt. Arnie 
Schwartz of Los Angeles CHP, and five volunteer board members. According to 
Sheila Gonzalez, supervisor of courts administrations at Ventura County 
Municipal Court, after meeting expenses, Tri-Valley puts money back into the 
community for driver's education and traffic safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-County has six locations in Ventura, Simi Valley, Westlake Village, and the 
main office in Thousand Oaks, which serve approximately 32,000 students 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Although in recent years the names and delivery style of schools have evolved, 
all operators and instructors must pass tests and be licensed by the DMV. Most 
instructors are associated with law enforcement or teaching, but a few are 
professional comedians. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Reck, an instructor in Santa Monica who served 28 years with the Los 
Angeles Police Department, says that almost any person could be "coached" to 
pass the comprehensive instructor's test, but an instructor needs experience in 
law enforcement to know traffic and the vehicle code. Reck says that humor in 
teaching is important but so is a knowledge of the law. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bill Gengler, spokesman for the DMV in Sacramento, a policy shift 
initiated by judges and public alike will soon require that approved traffic 
schools be listed by their state license numbers instead of their names. This 
practice is meant to eliminate advertising while it emphasizes the serious 
purpose of traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
