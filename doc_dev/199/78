<TEXT>      "Mountain Biking in the Bay Area." This is the second of two books. The
first is from San Francisco south, this is north of San Francisco. The books,
by Michael Hodgson and Mark Lord, are aimed at one of the fastest-growing
segments of the outdoors, mountain biking, and contain everything from biking
technique for the novice to track and trail detail for the expert.;    In book
two, north of San Francisco, there are 13 chapters dealing with specific areas
ranging from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area to Anthony Chabot
Regional Park. Each chapter includes a detailed map, a description of the
ride, the degree of difficulty, distance, and graphs showing elevation
changes.;    Both volumes of "Mountain Biking in the Bay Area" are available
from Western Tanager Press, 1111 Pacific Ave., Santa Cruz, CA 95060, and cost
$9.95 each, plus $1.50 for postage and handling.;     "South Bay Bike Trails."
This book is mostly for recreational road cyclists and offers a wide variety
of rides through Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties. Each chapter is a
different ride and starts with the distance, elevation gain, the type of bike
that should be used, a toughness rating and riding time. It adds one extra --
how many calories you'll burn during the ride.;    An index at the end helps
by breaking the rides down into easy, moderate, difficult and mountain bike
sections. Author Conrad Boisvert also gives some listings that should be handy
for beginning cyclists, including South Bay cycling shops, cycling clubs,
cycling events and California cycling laws.;    The book is available from
Penngrove Publications, 50 Crest Way, Penngrove, CA 94951, for $9.95 a copy,
plus $1 shipping and handling and 62 cents sales tax -- a total of $11.57 a
book.;     "The Pacific Crest Bicycle Trail." For those who want something
more than a day ride, San Mateo resident Bil Paul has put together detail of a
2,500-mile trip that is his biking version of the Pacific Crest hiking trail
stretching from Canada to Mexico.;    The 11-year project took him over both
paved and unpaved roads. Paul says his trail "should be popular with
bicyclists who like long-distance, challenging touring, as well as weekenders
who'd like to do small portions of the trail.";    The book sells for $12.95
plus $2 shipping and handling, and can be ordered from Bittersweet Publishing
Company, P.O. Box 1211, Livermore, CA 94551.;     "The Santa Cruz Mountains
Trail Book." This is an updated, sixth edition of a book first published in
1976. It includes nine new parks, along with numerous updates, on trails in
San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties. Along with maps and what to
expect on walks, there are some fun black and white photographs and general
information, including a page on identifying animal tracks.;    The book,
authored by Tom Taber, is published by The Oak Valley Press, 228 Virginia
Ave., San Mateo, CA 94402, and costs $9.95, plus postage and handling.;    
"Best Short Hikes in California's Northern Sierra." With so many books written
about hiking and camping in the Sierra Nevada, a book concentrating on shorts
hikes is a welcome addition. There are a total of 74 hikes detailed in nine
chapters that concentrate on general areas from Yosemite to the Lake
Tahoe/Donner Pass area.;    Authors Karen and Terry Whitehill note that the
majority of hikes are less than 10 miles round trip, and many are less than 5
miles. Each hike listing gives distance, difficulty, starting and high points,
maps, trip descriptions and the best times to go.;    An introduction that
includes a history of the Sierra, its vegetation and animals gives some
background. The book also concludes with a listing for additional reading.;   
It is available from The Mountaineers, 306 2nd Ave. West, Seattle, WA 98119,
or can be ordered by toll-free phone, (800) 553-4453. Cost is $12.95 plus $2
shipping and handling.;     "California Bass Angling Guide." The format for
this book by Joni Dahlstrom is simple -- take the 40 best California bass
fishing lakes and tell anglers how to get there, when to go and what to use
when they arrive. Facilities at or near the lake also are listed, as are
guides, and there is a full-page map of each area.;    Cost is $19.95 and the
book can be ordered from Frank Amato Publications, P.O. Box 82112, Portland,
Ore., 97282.;     "Western Public Campgrounds." This is Volume III of a
six-part series and includes California and Nevada. On the positive side, this
is a detailed index of numerous campgrounds, including location, access,
facilities, season and fees, natural features and attractions. All this is in
large, easy-to read type.;    On the negative side, there's a lot of type --
page after page of words with only a few photographs bunched together and one
pull-out map of California.;    The book, which costs $8.95, can be ordered
from Discovery Publishing, P.O. Box 50545, Billings, MT 59105.  </TEXT>
