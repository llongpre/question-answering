   EDITOR'S NOTE _ There's a new oasis in central Washington state,
and it is copying its future after the California wine country to
the south. It's a new tourist draw and Washingtonians are putting
out the welcome mat with a little home-brewed romance.

   Romantic dinner trains rumble through
canyons, famous musicians perform along the Columbia River, and
bed-and-breakfast inns seem as ubiquitous as apple trees.
   It's a long way from California's Napa Valley, but central
Washington's wine country is slowly developing into a tourist
attraction.
   As many as 300,000 people a year visit state wineries where an
array of facilities and activities are being developed to
accommodate them.
   ``The wineries have drawn an awful lot of people here,'' says
Gary Hogue, president of the Hogue Cellars winery near Prosser.
``Therefore the need for goods and services follow.''
   Still, there's no mistaking the area for Napa North, even though
Washington trails only California and New York in wine production.
   The Napa Valley has more than 250 wineries crowded into a 30-mile
long area, with attractions and services for more than 2.5 million
visitors a year.
   Central Washington, by contrast, has about 35 wineries scattered
across 180 miles, from Wenatchee to Walla Walla, many in small towns
lacking sophisticated amenities.
   ``Look at Napa 15 years ago and it was similar to what we have
now,'' says Randy Tucker, director of Tucker Cellars in Sunnyside.
``There were no motels, no restaurants, no bed-and-breakfasts.
   ``I think the wine industry has laid the groundwork for bringing
people in in large numbers.''
   Already there are signs of change.
   The Champs de Brionne Winery, outside George, Wash., for several
years has booked big-name musical performers such as Bob Dylan, Rod
Stewart and the Judds at its natural amphitheater above the Columbia
River. They draw up to 17,000 people to a town with a population of
just 260. The winery's products are the only liquor that can be
brought into the shows.
   Recently Washington Central Railroad Co. began operating dinner
trains that include winery stops.
   The Friday dinner and Sunday brunch train departs Yakima for the
college town of Ellensburg, where riders spend a half-hour at the
Cascade Crest Estates Winery in the converted railroad depot as the
engine is turned around.
   On Saturday night the dinner train runs from Kennewick to
Prosser, stopping at the Hogue Cellars. The three-hour rides cost
$45 a person.
   ``I think it's good for the wineries and good for the
passengers,'' says Brig Temple, manager of the dinner trains for the
railroad. ``Some out-of-town passengers get a chance to taste the
local flavors. It adds to the trip.''
   Another sign of tourism's impact is Tucker Cellar's decision to
build a tasting room in Yakima, in addition to its winery tasting
room 40 miles south in Sunnyside. The downtown Yakima facility is
designed to draw some of the convention visitors to central
Washington's largest city, Tucker says.
   ``They don't have time to go through the valley,'' he says.
   Washington has more than 70 wineries, with about half clustered
in the fruit-growing central region. The rest are scattered in
western Washington, with a handful in the Spokane area.
   Studying reports from 33 wineries across the state, from May to
September of 1987, a Washington State University survey found that
visitors ranged from 12 a month at one remote winery to 5,500 a
month at the busiest one.
   ``The average age of the visitors was 40 years old and the
average income was estimated at $40,000 per year,'' Folwell says,
adding most of the visitors lived in Washington.
   Large-scale wine production is only about a decade old in
Washington, and Gail Thompson of the state Department of Tourism
says promotion of the wineries to out-of-state visitors is still in
its infancy.
   ``We haven't been in the business of promoting visitors for years
and years, like the California wine country,'' Ms. Thompson says,
noting that one problem was inadequate maps on winery brochures to
direct visitors to some of the most remote locations.
   But everywhere there seems to be an awakening.
   Wil Masset, owner of Yakima's Birchfield Manor, recently opened a
five-room inn above his gourmet restaurant.
   ``There were six wineries in the state when we came,'' Masset
says. ``Now there are really super deluxe facilities a few miles
from here.''
   Another inn opened recently in Sunnyside. Three have opened in
Prosser in the past year, along with a 30-unit motel.
   Festivals provide the busiest weekends for the wineries,
including the spring barrel tasting when thousands of visitors
sample newly made wines right from the barrel.
   Tucker says 3,500 people visited his winery over that weekend.
   But for all the activity, winery owners are aware that central
Washington will never rival the Napa Valley, located near San
Francisco, primarily because the population density is just not
there, Hogue says.
   As lively as the tourist business is, the wineries rely on sales
to retail stores for volume. Only 13 percent of total production is
sold by the tasting rooms _ just about two bottles to the customer.
