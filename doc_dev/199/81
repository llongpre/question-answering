Those who know California's native plants also know that fall is the best time 
to plant them, so it is not too surprising that most of the special sales of 
native plants -- by botanic gardens and other groups -- occur during the autumn 
months. (Natives are hard to find at general nurseries because they look 
terrible in containers). Here are some sales coming up:

<P>
Fullerton: Every weekend from now through mid-December, the Fullerton Arboretum 
will be having their weekend plant sales, which among other things, will 
feature drought-tolerant plants and California natives from the Tree-of-Life 
Nursery. They also offer to special order any plant you are looking for. Hours 
are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays and 1 to 4 p.m. Sundays. The arboretum is 
located at the northeast corner of the California State University campus, on 
Associated Road, in Fullerton.

Santa Barbara: Santa Barbara Botanic Garden's fall sale is Oct. 21, from 12:30 
to 2:30 p.m., and will feature drought-tolerant plants from all of the world, 
but especially California natives, including the beautiful but hard to find 
bulbs, perennials and iris. The botanic garden is on 1212 Mission Canyon Road 
in Santa Barbara.
