<CAPTION>  Map; MAP: Jim Hummel -- Mercury News.; Visions of transit hub.; (Map of
Stanford Research Park showing proposed transit hub); A transit hub for
Stanford Research Park, as Palo Alto Councilman Mike Cobb imagines it, would
make Stanford Research Park a state-of-the-art work environment. The hub would
offer park employees and firms various services, possibly including:; (box)
Shuttles to CalTrain, buses, park-'n'-ride lots.; (box) Shuttle loop through
Stanford Research Park.; (box) Additional Shuttles to downtown Palo Alto,
Stanford, local hotels.; (box) Child care center.; (box) Rental cars for
car-poolers who miss their rides or have to work late.; (box) Conference
center for business meetings.; (box) Fiber optic network connecting conference
center with Research Park tenants and Stanford University.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  TAKE A glimpse at the working environment of the future:;    It's a business
campus of high-technology companies in a breathtaking foothill setting.
Thousands of workers arrive each day by bus, train, light rail and car pool.
They converge on a modern transportation hub on the edge of the campus, where
they transfer to electric shuttles that take them right to their office doors.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The hub includes a conference center, with meeting rooms linked by fiber
optic network to offices in the business campus and a nearby university. Next
door is a child care center, where the commuters drop off their children on
the way to work.;    At noontime and after work, people can hop a shuttle from
the transportation hub to area shopping centers and restaurants. For those who
have to work late and miss their rides home, the hub offers a fleet of small
rental cars, available at a cheap, overnight rate.;    WHERE DOES this
futuristic transit hub exist? Nowhere yet, except in the mind of Palo Alto
City Council member Mike Cobb. But Cobb hopes it will exist someday at the
corner of El Camino Real and Page Mill Road in Palo Alto and that it will
answer several of the problems facing the city's largest employer, the
Stanford Research Park.;    Today most of the 20,000 workers at Stanford
Research Park live a less than state-of-the-art lifestyle. You may recognize
it: They commute long distances, inching along Highway 101 and Oregon
Expressway, alone in their cars, cursing the traffic.;    Like workers in vast
industrial areas of North San Jose or Santa Clara or Fremont, they bemoan the
lack of transportation alternatives. They have no convenient child care. They
work in lush surroundings, far from big-city dirt and crime, yet they can't go
to a nice restaurant or buy a birthday card on their lunch hour without
getting in the car and fighting traffic.;    If this sounds like your life,
its origins lie along Page Mill Road. Stanford Research Park was the
grandfather of the Silicon Valley office parks. Today it is feeling the
effects of age. And a lot of people in Palo Alto are trying a little
rejuvenation therapy.;    Stanford University, which owns the land, is
preparing a strategic plan for the park. Palo Alto officials are assessing the
park's relationship to the city and looking for ways to improve it. The Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce is bringing research park managers together to
discuss mutual problems. And Cobb is peddling what he calls "my crazy idea"
for a transit hub. He also is setting up a task force of top executives from
local companies and the university.;    All these groups are hoping to find
the key to restoring the pre-eminence the park once enjoyed. We all had better
hope they succeed, because where Research Park leads, the rest of Silicon
Valley follows.;     STANFORD INDUSTRIAL Park opened in 1953, the first such
park in the country linked to a university. It became Silicon Valley's most
prestigious address, home to high-tech firms like Hewlett-Packard, Varian and
Xerox. The park was a boon to the city, which benefited from the sales tax
generated by the sales and manufacturing operations and the people they
employed. It also brought traffic and growth, which irked Palo Altans.;   
Times change. In 1980 the name was changed to Stanford Research Park,
reflecting a shift in the makeup of the park. More and more firms had moved
their manufacturing operations to less-expensive locations, keeping only their
research and development and administrative functions along Page Mill Road.;  
 But with the manufacturing and sales went the revenue they generated.
Suddenly Palo Alto realized that the source of 20 percent of its sales tax,
$2.28 million last year, was drying up.;    That's when then-Mayor Cobb began
his crusade to improve relations between the park tenants and the city. He
started talking with CEOs about their concerns (a novel idea in Palo Alto).
And what he heard wasn't encouraging: The park's appeal was fading. Tenants
were thinking about moving.;    "The park has done well in part because it's
close to Stanford. But that's not so important anymore," he said.;    It was
clear that something had to be done -- quick -- and that the city had to take
the initiative.;    "If you make it too hard for the tenants it isn't going to
work," Cobb said. "People will just leave.";    Meanwhile city Finance
Director Emily Harrison and Planning Director Ken Schreiber began their own
research, trying to assess the impact of the park on the city and find new
ways to monitor it.;     HARRISON'S COMMITTEE surveyed park tenants about
their concerns. She will present the survey results Tuesday night. What do
they complain about most? You won't be surprised:;    The high cost of
housing. Transportation. Child care. They want simple things, like sidewalks
and traffic signals so it's safe to walk. They want restaurants they can walk
to. The smaller companies would like a facility for meetings and training.;   
Suddenly Cobb's "crazy idea" doesn't sound so crazy. All the elements tossed
into Cobb's salad would contribute to the quality of life in Research Park and
help keep it alive.;    Of course there are problems: Past attempts at running
shuttle services have flopped. The land Cobb wants for the transit hub is next
to a federal Superfund toxic cleanup site, hardly the ideal location for a
child care center. The cost of building and, frankly, subsidizing such a
facility would be high, and these are not fiscally expansive times.;    Then
there is the biggest problem: Cooperation between the city, local industry and
Stanford. Industry has long felt the city's cold shoulder. As for the
city-Stanford relationship, let's see. How long have they been discussing the
Sand Hill Road extension? Ten years? Twenty?;    And yet in this case, it's in
everyone's interest to work together, and fast. Officials from all three
interested groups are pleased that the talking has begun.;    "We have to do
something with the park," Harrison said. "It might not be on the grand scale
of the hub. But the park tenants can't do it themselves.";    Keep your eye on
Stanford Research Park. It is a place where people dream up bold, creative
solutions to problems and then make them work. If a 21st century solution to
our regional traffic problems exists, we just might be able to find it there.  </TEXT>
