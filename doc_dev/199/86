Clarence Walthall probably won't get the notice in the mail from the county 
until early next year, but he's already thinking about it. Walthall is the 
operations manager of Petoseed Co. in Saticoy -- "in charge of everything that 
doesn't have to do with seeds," as he puts it -- and the notice he's expecting 
will require his company to change the commuting habits of the 160 people who 
work there. 
</P>
<P>
Walthall has a few ideas already: preferred parking places for car-poolers, 
flexible hours for some employees, awards for those departments with the most 
ride-sharing. But it's likely to be an uphill battle. "Flex-time" isn't an 
option for most of his workers. And rush-hour traffic, while congested, isn't 
bad enough to encourage most people to share a car or throw themselves on the 
mercy of notoriously circuitous bus routes. In the end, he says, "I'm just 
going to have to call them in here group by group and sell it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Most other big employers in Ventura County will be going through the same 
frustrating routine soon. Next week, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors 
will consider an air-pollution control rule that would force companies with 50 
or more employees to draw up so-called "trip-reduction" plans, designed to cut 
the number of commuter trips in cars and trucks. The measure is expected to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan succeeds in Ventura County, it will be a first. No other locality 
has tried to cut air pollution with such measures, although a few have 
succeeded in thinning peak-hour traffic. And the local business community is 
less than enthusiastic about a rule that could dramatically affect work 
schedules and business hours. 
</P>
<P>
The rule is similar to a requirement recently imposed on the four-county Los 
Angeles region by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Spokesman 
William Kelly said the South Coast agency has rejected about 40% of the 
companies' ride-sharing plans so far. "A lot of the companies seem to want to 
do the minimal amount required -- as little as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Ventura County ride-sharing rule meets its goal, it will reduce air 
pollution in the county by only about one-half of one percent. But its symbolic 
value is considerable. It would be the first regulation in Ventura County aimed 
at reducing smog from "mobile" sources -- such as cars and trucks -- rather 
than "stationary" sources such as factories and oil fields. As such, the rule 
is probably an indication of things to come, as county and federal officials 
struggle over the next few years to attain federal clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ventura County has suffered only two smog alerts in the last six years, 
its pollution problems are among the worst in the nation. In fact, the Air 
Pollution Control District has never set forth a strategy to meet federal air 
quality standards -- a violation of federal law which led a local environmental 
group, Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, to file suit in an effort to force 
tougher smog-fighting measures. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of a settlement last February, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency has until June, 1991, to prepare a clean air strategy for Ventura 
County. County air pollution officials are working with the EPA on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Orders Feared 
</P>
<P>
The ride-sharing rule is one step in that direction. "We are trying to avoid a 
situation where some federal judge says: 'Employees in Ventura County can drive 
to work on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday only,' " said County Supervisor Susan 
Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
The county doesn't intend to force people out of their cars, at least not 
directly. Rather, it may require large employers to draw up plans to encourage 
their employees to share rides or commute during off-peak hours -- 
specifically, before 6 a.m. and after 10 a.m. Those hours are considered 
critical because pollutants emitted from vehicles during morning hours "bake" 
in the air on hot, still days to create afternoon smog. 
</P>
<P>
Although company officials could be fined or even jailed if they refuse to draw 
up the trip-reduction plans, they cannot be penalized if their employees do not 
reduce their trips. For the most part, the county will take the word of 
companies that the plans are being followed, although it will require a 
progress report each year. 
</P>
<P>
Most organized business leaders in the county, including the Ventura County 
Economic Development Assn., support the rule. But individual firms vary in 
their commitment to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Plans Exist 
</P>
<P>
Some have old ride-sharing plans dating to the energy crisis of the late 1970s. 
GTE instituted an extensive, employer-subsidized van pool and private bus 
system when it moved its corporate headquarters from Santa Monica to Thousand 
Oaks four years ago. "We plan to do this at least until construction of the 
Ventura Freeway is done and possibly thereafter," said spokesman Larry Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Other employers fear that they will not be able to induce their workers to 
change their habits, especially if they live close to work. "Car-pooling may 
not make sense here," said Connie Taylor, public information officer at the 
Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion Center. Many of the base's 10,000 
employees live "almost on the perimeter of the base," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation experts acknowledge that it will be difficult for companies to 
meet the goals required of them, especially in a suburban county where 
dependence on the automobile is high and traffic congestion is not as great as 
it is in a large city such as Los Angeles. "There is no perceived need; 
therefore the effort is going to be so much more difficult," said Tricia Price, 
head of the Ventura office of Commuter Transportation Services, a nonprofit 
organization that runs the Commuter Computer and assists companies with 
ride-sharing plans. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful ride-sharing programs typically involve employees who 
travel long distances to work. For example, more than 10% of the 2,500 
employees who work at GTE's corporate headquarters use the company's private 
buses and van pools -- many from such distant locations as Long Beach and San 
Bernardino. These employees pay, on average, about $60 to $70 per month for the 
van service, but such fees only cover about a third of the cost. GTE picks up 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Help Seen 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, flexible work hours may be not be much help in achieving the 
goals because of the expansive definition of morning rush hours -- 6 a.m. to 10 
a.m. For example, the Naval Ship Weapons System Engineering Station at Port 
Hueneme, which has a mostly white-collar work force of 2,000 people, permits 
flexible work hours. But, said spokesman Russ Pyle, "we have to be at work by 
9." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Executive 
Officer Richard Baldwin pointed out, a four-day, 10-hour-per-day work schedule 
might be an effective tool to cut morning rush hour trips. Such schedules are 
still relatively rare, although in Los Angeles, virtually all 900 employees of 
the Air Quality Management District work a "4/10" schedule. Pyle said the Port 
Hueneme engineering operation has a four-day work week as an option, but no 
survey has been conducted to determine how many employees use it. 
</P>
<P>
Cities elsewhere have experienced some success at reducing traffic through 
car-pooling plans. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Northern California city of Pleasanton has aggressively 
required developers to reduce employees' commuting trips. In commending 
Pleasanton's efforts, urban planners around the U.S. have pointed to the city's 
dramatic results: 54% of all commuters either ride mass transit or drive during 
off-peak hours. But because the Pleasanton ordinance is designed to reduce 
traffic congestion, not smog, the definition of "peak" hours is narrow: 
7:30-8:30 a.m. and 4:30-5:30 p.m. Only 15% of the employees walk, bicycle, or 
ride a bus to work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Pride Helps 
</P>
<P>
Transportation experts say that corporate pride plays a role in implementing 
ride-sharing plans. Pasadena consultant Peter Valk, who has assisted L.A.-area 
companies in complying with the ride-sharing rule there, acknowledged that his 
clients may be reluctant at first to push hard. "But once they face the reality 
of having to make the investment, they figure they might as well make it pay 
off, both symbolically and in a real dollar way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Pleasanton, city transportation director Gail Gilpin said the bad publicity 
associated with not meeting the ride-sharing targets often motivates businesses 
to try harder. "All the information that comes through my office is on the 
public record, so if they don't reach their goal, it gets into the press real 
easily," she said. "That disincentive is probably greater than any fine." 
</P>
<P>
If the rule is approved, the Air Pollution Control District will begin working 
with companies of 100 employees or more next year. Companies of 75 to 99 
employees will be affected in 1991, and companies with 50 to 74 employees will 
be affected in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The county has about 580 companies with 50 or more employees; together, these 
companies employ about half the county's 250,000-member work force. The rule 
will apply only to employees who must report to the same location at least 10 
days per month. Most field workers will be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Under the trip-reduction rule, each company's "average vehicle ridership" must 
rise from an average of about 1.1 persons per vehicle today to 1.35 initially 
and 1.5 by 1997.
