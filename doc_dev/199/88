Mejdal attends to Pam Hesenflow of San Jose, who was giving blood Thursday.
The Red Cross collects blood for military and community needs. The group has
met the military's current needs and the Department of Defense has a
stockpile, so there's no immediate crisis. Blood cannot be earmarked for
Operation Desert Storm, but the Red Cross will make sure that all blood needed
in Saudi Arabia is sent there. The Red Cross phone number is (408) 292-6242.  </CAPTION>
