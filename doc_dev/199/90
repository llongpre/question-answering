   While a charity was collecting money to
help a man keep his electricity flowing, a city worker quietly went
to the power company and paid the bill out of his own pocket.
   ``I went down there to take care of that thing ... and I found
out it was paid,'' Nelson Johnson, who is unemployed, said Friday.
   He said he was told that George Tanner, a deputy city marshal,
had paid the bill Wednesday, the day after a newspaper described
Johnson's problems.
   ``I thought (Johnson) was in need and God has been good to me,''
said Tanner. ``My heart always goes out to those in need,'' he said.
   Johnson's troubles included not only the $63.41 bill, which was
90 days overdue, but the need to keep his 4-month-old daughter on
an electric heart monitor because of seizures and breathing
problems.
   Southwestern Electric Power Co., which had threatened to cut off
Johnson's electricity, had agreed to give Johnson until Friday to
pay the bill.
   Christian Services, which helped him work out the delay, also
collected money to pay the bill.
   Johnson said he would use the gifts to pay for food and medicine
for his wife, 4-year-old son and his infant daughter.

   A college student who pedaled 367
miles from the Tennessee state line to the Gulf of Mexico decided
there was an easier way to return _ by car.
   Jeff Lindner, who rode in a low-slung bicycle enclosed in a
synthetic fabric, had an average speed of 18.3 mph for the 20-hour
ride. The specialized vehicle, designed by students at the
University of Alabama at Huntsville, is worth more than $14,000.
   ``He's probably pretty danged tired. I know I would be after 20
hours,'' Bill Lindner, the cyclist's brother, said Saturday.
   The ride on Friday, sanctioned by the Ultra-Marathon Cycling
Association, was a tune-up for a coast-to-coast attempt scheduled
for October. Lindner previously rode the bike across Alabama.

   In almost reverential tones, they
spoke of tortuous twists and corkscrews, free falls and backward
loops.
   For the 100 members of the American Coaster Enthusiasts club who
met Saturday for their sixth annual midwinter conference, roller
coasters are more than a mere weekend amusement. They are serious
fun.
   ``We like rides that make you find religion, if you will,'' said
Randy Geisler of Minneapolis, president of the organization. ``We
like full gonzo scares.''
   The Chicago-based American Coaster Enthusiasts counts 1,500
members worldwide, said Geisler, who said he will head a group
visiting Japan this summer to sample Tokyo's rides.

   Even the well-off accept charity.
   Officials of this affluent community have published a list of
tax-deductible gifts they will accept to spruce up town _ among
them a $450 popcorn maker, a $12,000 copy machine, or several $500
wood benches ``to provide attractive, uniform seating at each tee
area on the golf course.''
   The gift suggestions are listed in a glossy pamphlet entitled
``Donations Guide to Community Giving.''
   ``I think it's a wonderful way for people to enhance the town,
and it's been done by other cities,'' Mayor Yvelyne ``Deedy'' Marix
said of the three-year-old program.
   The Palm Beach Teen Association is seeking the $450 popcorn
maker to ``provide healthy snacks'' and the police department wants
the $12,000 copying machine to replace its 14-year-old model.
   For gifts of $100,000 or more, Palm Beach promises a
``personalized plaque in a significant location.''
   An enclave of great wealth since the turn of the century, Palm
Beach boasted a per-capita income of more than $37,000 in 1985 _
the nation's most affluent suburb with a population of 10,000 or
more, The Palm Beach Post reported Saturday.
