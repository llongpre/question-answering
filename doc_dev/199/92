'IT COULDN'T BE BETTER,' SAY RELAXED, PLEASED COMMUTERS ON TROLLEY'S NEW EAST 
LINE

Penny Wilcox, who lives in El Cajon, boarded the San Diego Trolley at 6:49 
Friday morning. Exactly 34 minutes, 16 seconds after leaving the Spring Street 
station in La Mesa, the end of the new East Line Extension, the car arrived at 
the Gaslamp Quarter stop near 6th Avenue downtown. 
</P>
<P>
For Wilcox, a Pacific Bell employee who used to spend $65 a month on parking 
and always took El Cajon Boulevard because she loathed the freeway, the $1.25 
ride was a chance to rave. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great!" she said. "It saves me all of that money on parking, plus 
gas, wear and tear on the car, plus nerves. It's a wonderful way to get to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Friday marked Wilcox's first ride on the trolley, which began full service on 
the new leg of the East Line Extension Monday. She was persuaded to take the 
fire-engine-red trolley by her buddy and co-worker, Jim Tomlinson, who drove 
her to the station, which is 15 minutes from her home. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to take the bus," Tomlinson said. "One day, three different buses 
overheated. The trolley is so much better than the bus, you can't believe it, 
man. The bus might get you there in the same amount of time, but the trolley is 
cooler and cleaner, and you don't have to fight wall-to-wall people." 
</P>
<P>
That may have been the most surprising facet of the Friday commute. Trolley 
cars leaving La Mesa between 7 and 11 in the morning were far from sold out -- 
more like half full. But, by the time the trolley arrived downtown, stopping at 
stations along the way, few seats were left. The parking lot outside the Spring 
Street station offered plenty of spaces at 6:45 a.m. and wasn't full at 11. 
</P>
<P>
Trolley officials offer a different story, however. Heather Kunz, a spokeswoman 
</P>
<P>
for the Metropolitan Transit Development Board, said the 150-space Spring 
Street parking lot "is almost always filled to capacity, with 20 to 30 people 
parking illegally throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have figures for the total number of customers yet, but we've had to 
add extra trains on the run to La Mesa. We're taking an estimated 200 riders 
per (trolley car) at rush hour. We're calling rush hour 6:30 to 9 in the 
morning, 3:30 to 6 in the evenings." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's customers said morning rush hour had been quiet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want to Keep It Secret 
</P>
<P>
"It's been this way, and I hope it stays this way," said Bill Lemen(, an 
SDG&amp;E engineer who boarded in La Mesa. "It's a secret we should try to 
keep. I used to drive 45 minutes into work from my home in Jamul. Now, I drive 
11 miles to the Spring Street station, 15 minutes or so, and take it right in. 
I'm free of the hassle. I read and relax and look at people on the freeway, 
fighting the traffic. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Lemen's office is two blocks from the trolley stop. Before, he had to walk 15 
minutes from a parking lot to the SDG&amp;E building. His one complaint is that 
the rate for a monthly pass will jump at the end of the month from $40 to $45. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Sotelo, a legal secretary who works for the state, boarded the trolley 
at Massachusetts Avenue in Lemon Grove, one of four new stops that snake beyond 
Euclid Avenue in Southeast San Diego to Spring Street. The others are Encanto 
62nd Street and Broadway in Lemon Grove. By June 25, service will extend to 
four more stops, the last at Main and Marshall in El Cajon. Early in the next 
decade, service will expand into Lakeside, Santee and also north, toward Del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Like those around her, Sotelo was bullish on the trolley, for not having to 
hassle with traffic and pay for parking. She offered another, more subtle 
reason -- the "meditative" ride it gives her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Chance to Think 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the scenery along San Diego's Southeast corridor isn't the best, but 
it "gives me the opportunity to think," she said, "to get my mind together, to 
frame the day. I think it helps me at work, makes me a better employee." 
</P>
<P>
Byron Frohn, a draftsman for the city of San Diego Planning Department, is no 
stranger to riding buses. Frohn said he spent more time getting to and from 
work via the trolley, but that the pleasure of a trolley ride was "boundless" 
contrasted with stuffy stop and go of the city's bus system. 
</P>
<P>
"I just love to look out the window and think about things," he said. "The ride 
is calm and efficient and a lot better than driving or busing." 
</P>
<P>
A co-worker and friend, Leo DeJesus, who works in Frohn's department, got on at 
the Encanto 62nd Street station. DeJesus said he had been paying $8 a day in 
parking and that "more than once" the money he had placed in the proper slot 
had been pilfered. So, he would lose $8 and have to pay a parking ticket as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"The trolley helps a lot," he said. "I'm saving at least $40 a week." 
</P>
<P>
Bernetta Puryear(, a preschool teacher who boards at the Euclid station, said 
she has made "lots of new friends" and met "lots of nice people" by riding the 
rails. She, too, is a veteran of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe how much more comfortable the ride is on this thing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vampire Lovers, Too 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone comes across as someone you'd want to meet, however. One gangly 
fellow boarded the trolley near downtown and accosted two passengers who were 
reading newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I see your movie section?" he bellowed. "I want to see where that new 
vampire movie is playing. I love vampire movies." 
</P>
<P>
After finding out the dozen or so locations where "Fright Night: Part II" was 
playing, he let them know that his favorite vampire "of all time" was Bela 
Lugosi, whom he proceeded to imitate. Finding the audience unreceptive, he got 
off at the next stop. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Wilcox said she will happily endure benign vampire aficionados for the 
grim anxieties of motoring to work each day. She once had an engine catch on 
fire on the freeway, and another of her cars broke down in some sleazy 
neighborhood she would just as soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
"I was gone no more than a half-hour, to call for help," she said. "I get back, 
and they've stripped my car! They've finished! They took everything that wasn't 
nailed down. No sir, I'll take the trolley and get to work relaxed -- and in 
one piece, thank you. Based on a first time, I'd say this couldn't be better."
