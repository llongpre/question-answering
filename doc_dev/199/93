SPECIAL BUS OFFERED FOR COMMUTE HOURS

<P>
In a bid to reduce traffic congestion caused by construction on the Santa Ana 
Freeway, the Orange County Transport District on Tuesday started a special bus 
route for commute-hour travelers between San Juan Capistrano and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The first 19-seat passenger van left the Junipero Serra Road Park-and-Ride 
station in San Juan Capistrano at 5:31 a.m. It arrived in Anaheim 80 minutes 
later, after making scheduled stops in Laguna Hills, Irvine, Tustin and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The number of commuters using the service Tuesday was not immediately 
available, but OCTD officials are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope some motorists will seize this opportunity and leave their cars at 
home," OCTD spokeswoman Mona Ziada said. "Everyone benefits -- they don't have 
to drive through the congestion, and they help to free up traffic." 
</P>
<P>
To encourage commuters to use the new route, OCTD is offering free rides during 
the first two weeks of service. From Sept. 17, commuters will pay $1.80 for the 
Anaheim-San Juan Capistrano run and $1.30 for either Anaheim-Laguna Hills or 
Anaheim-Irvine. Transfers to connecting OCTD routes are free. 
</P>
<P>
Ziada said the district had signed a $82,746 contract for the Yellow Cab Co. to 
operate the new route. 
</P>
<P>
The service includes four morning trips leaving the South County station at 
30-minute intervals. The first of four return trips leave the Anaheim station 
at Katella Avenue and State College Boulevard at 4:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has agreed to pay 50% of the costs as part of an agreement between the 
state agency and OCTD. The agreement calls for the district to provide 
ride-sharing programs during the freeway reconstruction, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ziada said the district is almost certain to make the route permanent, even 
after construction work on the freeway is completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Bus Route 
</P>
<P>
The first express bus linking San Juan Capistrano to Anaheim will run, with 
stops in Laguna Hills, Irvine, Tustin and Orange. The buses will leave every 30 
minutes.
