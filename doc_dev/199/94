   Actor Ed Begley Jr., who frequently arrives
at work on a city bus, comes for an interview this day on a bicycle.
   He sheds his backpack and plastic foam helmet and sits down to
talk about USA Network's first miniseries, ``Not a Penny More, Not
a Penny Less,'' to be televised Tuesday and Wednesday. Later, he
will ride over the Hollywood Hills to Paramount Studios for some
preliminary work on his forthcoming NBC series ``Parenthood.''
   In the four-hour, two-part miniseries on USA, Begley plays an
American teacher at Oxford University who organizes a sting. He and
three Englishmen have lost a bundle in a stock swindle and want
their money back. They devise their own swindles that appeal to the
ego of the crooked financier played by Edward Asner.
   The lighthearted adventure, based on the novel by Jeffrey Archer
and adapted by Sherman Yellen, was filmed on location in England
and Monte Carlo by director Clive Donner. It also stars Maryam
d'Abo, Jenny Agutter, Brian Protheroe, Nicholas Jones and
Francois-Eric Gendron.
   ``My character on `Not a Penny More' was the ringleader,''
Begley says. ``We were trying to get our money back from Ed Asner.
I come up with the plan, but the others are not convinced it will
work.''
   In ``Parenthood,'' Begley will play the role Steve Martin had in
the hit movie. Producer-director Ron Howard, producer Brian Grazer
and writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel will also be working on
the series.
   ``We're going to shoot `Parenthood' at a little studio past
Valencia,'' Begley says. ``That's 20 miles north of here. I'll ride
my bike up this weekend to see what it's like. If it's a grind,
I'll take the bus. And if there's no bus, I'll have to take the car.
   ``I've eliminated that fix we all have for the automobile. I'm a
person who runs around a lot. Riding the bus has made me slow down.
It's been good for me.''
   Begley is probably best known for his role as Dr. Victor Ehrlich
on ``St. Elsewhere.'' But he's also become very active in movies.
He was caught between Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr in
``She-Devil.''
   He'll soon be seen in ``Meet the Applegates,'' about an
All-American family that probably has an aversion to insect spray.
   ``They're really large invasive bugs from South America who can
adapt to any environment,'' Begley says. ``They turn themselves
into human beings and become the Applegates.''
   The movie also stars Dabney Coleman and Stockard Channing.
   Begley was born into an acting family and started his own career
as a teen-ager. His father was Academy Award-winning actor Ed
Begley (``Sweet Bird of Youth'') and his mother actress Jean Joyce.
   Begley began his acting career on ``My Three Sons'' when he was
about 17.
   ``The first time I was ever noticed was on `Room 222,''' he
says. ``I was on six or seven times playing students. I was Bob. I
was Stretch Webster.''
   Begley was born in Los Angeles and went to grade school in New
York.
   ``My parents were doing a lot of work on the stage,'' he says.
``I came back here for high school and college. I used to go back
and forth between the coasts. I loved the trains.''
   He got his first taste of fame on ``Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman.'' He played a deaf-mute who was the boyfriend of Mary's
sister. His fame didn't last long, however. He was in such movies
as ``The In-Laws'' and ``Cat People.''
   ``Then `St. Elsewhere' came along and things got better,'' he
says. ``I was asked to be host of `Saturday Night Live.' That was a
dream come true for a comedian.
   ``Ehrlich was a very noticeable character on `St. Elsewhere.''
People seemed to like to dislike him. I've been working ever
since.''
   Begley says his greatest regret is that he never got to work
with his father, who died in 1970.
