<LEADPARA>  A stately old home, part of San Jose's past, could be demolished soon because
efforts to move it from the San Jose State University campus to another
location have been stymied.;    The university offered to let anyone move it
so it wouldn't have to be demolished to make room for a science classroom
building, but there were no takers.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     However, two city council members asked university President Gail Fullerton
this week to forestall demolition until they have time to explore preserving
the building. And the Preservation Action Council of San Jose has formed a
task force to make a last-ditch effort to save it.;    The house, located on
what would be Fifth Street at San Carlos Street, was built just after the turn
of the century by Victor Scheller, a local district attorney, Chamber of
Commerce president and son of an early settler.;    The imposing residence, an
example of California colonial revival architecture with about 5,200 square
feet, has been used as offices for the past several years.;    The university
advertised more than a year ago that it would be sold for a nominal sum to
anyone who would move it off the campus, said Mo Qayoumi, associate executive
vice president for facilities.;    Demolition was delayed once before to give
more time to find someone interested in saving it, but now the university must
proceed with plans to tear it down after asbestos -- primarily in the exterior
paint -- is removed, Qayoumi said. He expects the work to start in the next
week.;    But council members David Pandori and Judy Stabile wrote Fullerton
on Thursday asking for a further delay to give them time to work with the
university to save the building. It is the first request from the city to the
university since the city council took steps late last year toward closing San
Carlos Street through campus, a closing long sought by Fullerton.;   
Fullerton and other university officials were not available Friday to comment
on the council members' request.;    The seedy-looking house is in good shape
structurally. But it would cost $300,000 to $600,000 to move it, settle it on
a new foundation and renovate it, estimates Craig Mineweaser, a San Jose
architect who specializes in historical restorations.;    The home probably
was a showplace when Scheller built it in the valley where he was born. His
father, Louis A. Scheller, was a German immigrant who worked for a fellow
countryman, Charles M. Weber, on Weber's 8,787-acre Rancho Canada de San
Felipe y las Animas, east of what later became Highway 101 south of San Jose.
In 1864, after 12 years as an employee, Louis A. Scheller bought the property;
Scheller Avenue was named for him.;    In 1871, he moved to San Jose to take
advantage of better educational opportunities for his five children, including
Victor, who graduated from Santa Clara College (now University) before
enrolling in Hastings law school in San Francisco.;    Victor Scheller was out
of college only a few months before he ran for Santa Clara County district
attorney on the Democratic ticket, winning in an upset to become the youngest
man ever elected to the office in the state.;    After winning election twice,
Scheller went into private practice and became active in civic affairs,
serving as president of the local Chamber of Commerce from 1901 to 1911. He
died in San Francisco in 1938 at age 75.;    The house survived, first as a
residence, later as a rooming house and most recently as the offices of the
campus African-American Studies and the Urban and Regional Planning programs.;
   April Halberstadt, a preservationist fighting the home's demise, suggests
that the new science classroom building could be moved several feet to allow
the house to stay, but Qayoumi said the university must follow rules for
clearances between buildings.  </TEXT>
