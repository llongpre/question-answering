Whittier College officials, while acknowledging that the school's liberal 
financial aid policy contributed to a decade of money problems, last week vowed 
to continue helping needy students. 
</P>
<P>
"Our commitment to financial aid will not change," said Susan Pearce, vice 
president for college advancement, as college officials attempted to work out 
details of plans to bring the school's spending into line with revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a very strong step forward academically," said College President 
Eugene S. Mills, referring to the 101-year-old college's growing academic 
reputation. "Financial aid was part of that commitment, and we will continue to 
have a strong commitment in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the 950-student college announced plans recently to eliminate 
nearly 10% of its teaching and administrative positions by the end of the 
school year. The college would have faced an operating deficit of at least 
$262,000 by the end of June if spending changes had not been made, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Strained 
</P>
<P>
Salaries at the private, Quaker-founded college, located in a quiet residential 
area west of the Uptown business district, make up much of the $20-million 
operating budget, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged, however, that financial aid programs strained the college's 
finances, and were partly responsible for virtually depleting a $5-million 
reserve fund over an 11-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Although tuition has tripled from $3,500 in 1978-79 to $10,500 today, Whittier 
College's contribution to overall financial-aid funding in the same period has 
increased more than tenfold from $368,602 to $3.8 million, Finance Director 
Joseph E. Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
That increase, as well as overly optimistic projections of student enrollment, 
caused the college to spend more money than it took in for nine of the past 11 
years, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of students receive some sort of financial aid, a figure that is not 
unusual for colleges and universities. But Whittier College last year spent 
about 20% of its operating budget on financial aid, as much as 9 percentage 
points more than colleges of comparable size in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier's comparatively low endowment contributed to the higher allocation of 
operating income to financial aid. The college has an endowment fund of $16 
million, compared to a $250-million endowment fund at Pomona College and a 
$430-million endowment at Caltech, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
Most other colleges, with much larger endowments, set aside a smaller 
percentage of their operating budgets for financial aid, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
At Pomona College, for example, 12% of the college's operating budget went to 
financial aid. Occidental College allocated 16% of its operating funds to aid 
students, and Harvey Mudd College devoted 11% of its operating budget to 
financial aid, according to those schools' financial records. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $3.8 million of college funds for financial aid, another 
$3.4 million in federal, state and restricted funds have been distributed this 
year by the college's financial aid office, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a commitment here in general that nobody should be turned away 
for getting an education here because of financial difficulties," sociology 
professor Les Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to put together packages that make education possible" for 
students who cannot otherwise afford it, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Focus 
</P>
<P>
Whittier College's increase in financial aid coincided with the 1979 hiring of 
Mills and a plan by college staff to change the focus of the school's liberal 
arts curriculum and seek a national reputation in academic excellence, college 
officials said. Mills will leave in June to complete a research project. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the commitment to make a difference" in the academic programs, Dean of 
Students Robert B. Marks said. "We set out to achieve academic recognition, and 
we achieved that." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Whittier College was ranked the fourth best small, comprehensive 
college in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report in October. The weekly 
news magazine devotes an issue each year to judging the academic quality of 125 
domestic colleges and universities. The year before, Whittier College was voted 
third in the same category. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine cited Whittier College's 7-year-old Liberal Education Program, 
which pairs unrelated classes to highlight possible similarities. For example, 
the college offers programs linking sociology with 19th-Century literature, 
Spanish with physical education and biology with ethics in religion. 
</P>
<P>
Some students said they were drawn to Whittier College because of its small 
size, its growing academic reputation and financial aid packages that made the 
school more affordable than some state university systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have stayed in Utah" and attended the state university system, said 
senior Holly Tuckett of Salt Lake City. She said she "practically got a free 
ride" through a Whittier College financial aid package based on need. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Good Package' 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me a real good package," said Tuckett, who works part time with 
severely handicapped children. "I figured, 'What the heck, I can get a quality 
education from a private college . . . or go to a state school with 300 
students in one class.' " 
</P>
<P>
When she graduates in six months, she will begin paying back about $4,000 in 
federal and Whittier College loans accumulated over four years. 
</P>
<P>
Other students agreed that Whittier College was the best option for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have gone to City College," said sophomore Michael Harris of Los 
Angeles. "If it wasn't for Whittier, I wouldn't be able to afford this 
education. It's pretty decent here." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a starting cornerback on the football team, said a financial aid 
package of $14,000 has covered virtually everything but $1,000 a year in 
dormitory fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Minorities 
</P>
<P>
College officials said that recruiters have concentrated on bringing talented 
minority students to Whittier College. Almost 40% of Whittier College students 
are minority or foreign-born, according to financial aid office figures. About 
90% of those who receive financial aid are minority students. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a Times survey showed that Whittier College has a higher percentage of 
full-time undergraduate Latino students than any comparable small private 
college in Southern California. College officials said that they have remained 
committed to enrolling a high percentage of Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Santana, a sophomore from Bell Gardens, said that one of his Bell 
Gardens High teachers, a Whittier College alumnus, encouraged him to apply to 
the 4-year college rather than to a community college. The first of his family 
to continue his education after high school, Santana said that his family was 
not prepared to pay for any college. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing at Whittier, Santana said he became excited about the 
college. Now he wants to go on to graduate school and study political science. 
"I want to bring something back to my community," Santana said. "I didn't 
realize how important my background and my (Latino) community was until I came 
here."
