   A gunshot hit a Greyhound bus Wednesday night,
cracking a window but leaving the driver and passengers unhurt in
the latest violence in the strike against the country's only
nationwide bus company, authorities said.
   In another development three days after Greyhound broke off
contract talks with its striking drivers, the company expanded bus
service to 70 new locations, mostly between Boston and Washington.
   The bus, carrying 30 passengers to Dallas, was on an entrance
ramp to Interstate 35 in San Antonio around 7:30 p.m. when the
bullet hit its service door, said Travis County sheriff's Lt.
George Meek.
   The driver continued about 70 miles north to Austin before
reporting the shooting, Meek said. The assailant was unknown.
   The bullet penetrated the first window of the double-window
door, but not the second because it contained thick, insulated
plastic, the lieutenant said.
   The incident brought to at least 15 the number of shooting
attacks on Greyhound buses. There have also been 46 bomb threats
and numerous other incidents of vandalism or threats, company
officials say.
   State police in Virginia investigated a shooting attack on a
Greyhound bus carrying about 50 passengers from Roanoke into
Christiansburg late Tuesday. No one was injured. Trooper E.R. Adams
said holes in the windshield apparently were made by a
small-caliber rifle.
   Greyhound abruptly ended strike talks Sunday, accusing union
leaders of stonewalling and of stepping up attacks on buses and
replacement drivers.
   Unions representing 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other
Greyhound workers walked out March 2 over wages, job security and
grievance procedures.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions said it would
resume negotiations at any time.
   ``The company walked away from the table about 10 a.m. Sunday,
but the union stayed at the table,'' said union spokesman Nick
Nichols. ``As far as we are concerned, we are still at the table,
waiting for them to come back.''
   Frank J. Schmieder, president and chief operating officer of
Greyhound Lines Inc., said that as of Wednesday, ``we are running
46 percent of our pre-strike schedule miles. That is an increase of
35,617 miles daily compared to yesterday, or 14 percent.''
   That included restoration of service to 70 locations, mostly in
the Boston-Washington corrider, as replacement drivers complete
training, Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said.
   ``Today, we're up to 1,514'' drivers, Gravley said. ``The first
day we had around 300.''
   Tuesday's ridership was 45,829 passengers, about one-third of
ridership on the same day last year, the company said.
   The union said it believes Greyhound is operating at 15 percent
of pre-strike levels. A restoration of service to 70 communities,
when Greyhound served 9,500, ``doesn't say much,'' said spokesman
Nichols.
   In Chattanooga, Tenn., a judge issued a restraining order
Wednesday limiting picketing at the city's Greyhound terminal to
two people and forbidding acts of violence or intimidation. A
similar restraining order was issued Tuesday in Fayetteville, N.C.
   The company has obtained a total of 17 restraining orders
against the union, Gravley said.
   Greyhound downplayed Tuesday's decision by Standard &amp; Poor's to
downgrade the company's credit rating from B to B-. Wall Street's
premier bond rating company cited a $380 million debt from a 1987
leveraged buyout and said the strike has ``caused substantial
losses.''
   ``We feel we have a sound financial position and we're just
continuing to operate as we had planned to do all along,'' Gravley
said. ``We're not in the market to borrow money right now so it's
not going to affect us immediately.''
