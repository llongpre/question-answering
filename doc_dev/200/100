   Showers drenched much of the South today, with thunderstorms
hovering over Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee after a
violent night of weather that included lightning, hail, damaging
winds and a tornado.
   The thunderstorms lingered ahead of a slow moving cold front
curving through the south-central United States.
   In southwest Texas, a thunderstorm spawned a tornado northeast of
Sanderson late Tuesday evening; another storm whipped up winds in
Pecos County, overturning a car in Sheffield.
   Also in Texas, golfball-sized hail pounded northeast Reklaw, and
Overton was hit with 1-inch hail. Lightning started a house fire in
Price, as well as an oil tank fire in Rusk County.
   In Louisiana, storm winds gusted to 49 mph at Shreveport; and
trees were downed by the stiff winds west of Bellevue. Two inches of
rain fell on Blanchard in 30 minutes, causing some lowland flooding.
   Showers and thunderstorms swept over much of south-central and
eastern Texas early today. Showers and thunderstorms also extended
from northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas to western Tennessee.
   Earlier, thunderstorms in eastern Texas dumped 5 inches of rain
at New London, and 4{ inches of rain at Henderson. Flooding was
reported around Karnack after it was deluged by 3{ inches of rain.
   Elsewhere around the country, a few showers and thunderstorms
were moving along a cold front crossing the central Plains region
and the middle Mississippi Valley. Showers also edged ahead of a
cold front nearing the northern Pacific Coast.
   Dense fog blanketed parts of eastern Wisconsin and northeastern
Ohio early today. But much of the southeastern United States enjoyed
clear skies.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms for much of
the Atlantic Coast states across the Great Lakes region, the Ohio
and Tennessee valleys, the Gulf Coast states, the Mississippi Valley
and the southern Plains to New Mexico; numerous showers and
thunderstorms over the upper Ohio Valley; and showers along the
Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s and 60s from the upper
Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes region; in the 60s over the
northern and central Great Plains, eastern New England, and along
the Pacific Coast; reaching the 90s over the south Atlantic coastal
states, eastern portions of the Gulf Coast region, extreme southern
Texas and interior valleys of California; 100 along the Rio Grande
Valley of southwest Texas, with 110 temperatures in the desert
Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s across much of the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Gillette, Wyo., to 93 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.
