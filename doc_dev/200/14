   Alien supporters of a Marxist Palestinian
group may not be deported because even non-citizens have the First
Amendment right to espouse anti-American beliefs, a judge ruled in
gutting a McCarthy-era law.
   ``In this case, the government is trying to stifle certain ideas
from entering our society from certain aliens,'' U.S. District Judge
Stephen V. Wilson said.
   ``Our society, however, was built on the premise that only
through the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper.''
   Wilson's ruling Thursday struck down four provisions of the 1952
McCarran-Walter Act that allowed the government to deport aliens who
advocated or were associated with groups espousing anti-American
ideologies including communism.
   He said the sections of the law passed during a time when Sen.
Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., was whipping up Cold War fears against
communism were ``overbroad'' and could cause deportation for
something as simple as wearing a political button.
   ``Now I feel I can speak freely. I did not an hour ago,'' said
Khader Hamide, 34, one of the eight defendants the government had
sought to deport for allegedly supporting the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist member of the Palestine
Liberation Organziation.
   In his ruling, Wilson also threw out an exception to a 1987 law
that recognized free speech rights in deportation proceedings for
all immigrants except members of the PLO.
   Wilson acknowledged world concern over terrorist threats but said
his decision would not interfere with Congress' ability to enforce
laws already in place to deal with terrorism.
   ``Our decision ... today will not significantly deplete the
government's arsenal in combating terrorism,'' said Wilson, whose
ruling applies only to central and southern California.
   Michael P. Lindemann, the Justice Department's lead attorney in
the case, said the ruling would be appealed. He declined further
comment.
   Paul Hoffman of the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped
in the defense, said the long-term effects of Wilson's ruling would
not be evident until all appeals are resolved.
   However, he predicted the case will be resolved by the U.S.
Supreme Court and could create a landmark precedent in First
Amendment law.
   The case involved seven Jordanians of Palestinian descent and a
Kenyan who were arrested two years ago, held without bail and
subjected to deportation proceedings under the 36-year-old law. An
immigration judge released them after prosecutors refused to present
their allegations in public, demanding a secret forum that was
refused.
   The government eventually dropped McCarran-Walter proceedings
against all but two, although it sought deportation of the others on
technical grounds.
   Wilson cited the landmark 1969 decision in Brandenburg vs. Ohio,
in which the Supreme Court held that the government can only
prohibit speech directed toward inciting imminent lawless action.
   The judge also ruled that the PLO exception to the 1987 Foreign
Relations Authorization Act violated guarantees of due process and
equal protection under the law.
   The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination committee sued the Justice
Department on behalf of the immigrants, joined by the ACLU and the
New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights,
   ``We feel as a community now we can speak our minds on the
Palestinian issue,'' said Hamide, 34. ``We can speak our minds on
the uprising on the West Bank and in Gaza and express our opinions
freely without the fear of being put in jail.''
   David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights said the
ruling on the PLO exception means that ``Congress cannot make
politically motivated distinctions in providing First Amendment
rights to aliens.''
