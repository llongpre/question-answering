   A plane that crashed into a foggy
mountaintop, killing a Las Vegas church leader and eight family
members on a holiday trip to Disneyland, failed to clear the ridge
by less than 200 feet, authorities said.
   The wreckage of the chartered twin-engine Cessna 402 was found
Monday near the top of a 2,270-foot ridge overlooking Hagador Canyon
in the Santa Ana Mountains of Southern California.
   The plane crashed Sunday, scattering bodies and debris over a
100-yard area in the Cleveland National Forest 45 miles southeast of
Los Angeles.
   ``There were toys in the airplane, including two little stuffed
Mickey Mouses,'' said Mickey Worthington of the Riverside County
coroner's office.
   The dead were tentatively identified as Michael Cranson, 36, a
Las Vegas police officer; his wife, Raeann, 33; their five children
_ Shauna, 15; Stephanie, 14; Nicole, 12; Joshua, 11; and Kyle, 7 _
James Montano, 24, and Cynthia Montano, 23. The Montanos were
identified in Las Vegas as Raeann Cranson's sister and
brother-in-law.
   Also killed in the crash was the pilot, identified as Hassan
Berro, co-owner of Las Vegas Flyers charter line.
   ``They found Michael, and they found his police badge,'' said
Merrill Pugmire, who is bishop of the family's Mormon Church stake
in Las Vegas.
   The plane left McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas on
Sunday morning and went down about 20 miles short of its
destination, Orange County John Wayne Airport. The plane vanished
from radar screens that afternoon.
   ``The bodies and baggage were ripped apart and scattered over the
peak,'' said KNX-AM reporter Bob Tur, who discovered the wreckage
during a helicopter flight. He said the fuselage was twisted, broken
into several pieces and partly buried.
   Cranson was president of a Mormon young men's group and had been
active in youth work and Scouting, he said.
   ``They were very excited, they had been planning this as a family
weekend get-together,'' said family friend Lora Dee Christensen, who
spent Monday morning at the Cranson home. ``They were very devoted
to their church and always very concerned about each other. They
were just a beautiful family.''
   The crash was under investigation by the National Transportation
Safety Board, whose crew arrived at the crash site late Monday.
