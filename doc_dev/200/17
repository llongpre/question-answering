Government efforts to deport a group of immigrants once charged with subversion 
ran into more roadblocks Friday in Immigration Court as Justice Department 
attorneys admitted that they had wrongly charged one of the defendants with 
fraud in a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration Judge Ingrid K. Hrycenko ruled that deportation efforts aimed at 
two lead defendants -- Khader Hamide, 35, of Los Angeles, and Michel Shehadeh, 
33, of Long Beach -- cannot proceed until a federal court decision affecting 
their cases is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Hamide and Shehadeh face subversion charges under the McCarran-Walter Act. The 
act, passed during the McCarthy era of the 1950s, allows the deportation of 
aliens for advocating world communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the 
unlawful destruction of property. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles overturned 
several of the act's political sections and declared that aliens have the same 
broad free speech rights as U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Until the McCarran-Walter decision is resolved -- whether through the appellate 
process or simply by having the government throw in the towel -- Hrycenko ruled 
that their cases "will not proceed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 Immigrants Jailed 
</P>
<P>
Hamide and Shehadeh were among eight immigrants -- seven Palestinians and a 
Kenyan -- arrested in January, 1987, and jailed for almost two weeks on charges 
that they belonged to a Palestinian group with a history of terrorism. All 
denied the charges, and none were charged criminally. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were eventually dropped against three other immigrants. But three more 
still faced lesser deportation charges -- and for the first time in 27 months 
the government proceeded against them this week. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a three-man team of Justice Department attorneys from Washington 
moved against Bashar Amer, 27, of Glendale. He is charged with not maintaining 
his academic status -- that is, not taking 12 units a semester, as generally 
required by immigration rules, at Chaffey College in Rancho Cucamonga between 
1985 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, immigration officials subpoenaed Amer's college records. But when 
Justice Department attorney Stewart Deutsch produced the subpoena for the court 
on Friday, it said that Amer was being investigated in connection with "a fraud 
against the United States." 
</P>
<P>
A surprised Hrycenko asked Deutsch how that could be possible when the charge 
against Amer was that he had not taken enough college credits to remain in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Maybe It's Sloppiness' 
</P>
<P>
"There is no fraud," Deutsch admitted. "That is an error." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's solely sloppiness," said Hrycenko. She continued Amer's hearing 
until July so that the government could change the charge. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based immigration official who signed the erroneous subpoena, 
John Brechtel, assistant district director for investigations, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Amer's lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout of the National Lawyers Guild, said he had "no 
reason to think (the fraud charge) wasn't intentional" in light of the 
government's continuing efforts to deport the immigrants.
