   A nuclear weapons test rocked the Nevada
desert today, registering 5.6 on the Richter scale and causing a
swaying motion in high-rise buildings here, 100 miles from ground
zero.
   John Minsch, a spokesman for the National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., said the reading indicated the test was
one of the larger ones conducted at the desert site.
   The device was detonated 40 miles from Mercury, a tiny town on
the Nevada Test Site where Soviet nuclear scientists are based
while preparing for a joint U.S.-Soviet test next month.
   A controller in the tower at McCarran International Airport in
Las Vegas said the tower rocked slightly seconds after the blast,
at 8:05 a.m.
   A telephone switchboard operator at Fitzgerald's Hotel in
downtown Las Vegas said a guest on the 29th floor called to ask why
she felt ground motion.
   And a receptionist at the Lionel, Sawyer law firm, atop a
high-rise office building downtown, said she felt a ``dizzy,
swirling feeling'' at the time of the blast. She said a hanging
plant in the office began swaying.
   All three declined to give their names.
   Motion was recorded on Energy Department seismographs atop
several hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown. Motion
was also recorded at Scotty's Castle in Death Valley, Calif., west
of the test site.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.An earthquake or explosion of 3.5 on the Richter scale
can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5
considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
   The test was delayed five minutes while controllers checked out
a malfunctioning signal.
   Energy Department spokesman Chris West said the test appeared to
be normal, with no indications of any problems. West, who was in a
control center 25 miles from ground zero, said monitors at the site
indicated no radiation had escaped the ground.
   He said slight ground motion was felt in the control center.
   Today's test was the eighth conducted this year, and the sixth
conducted with Soviet scientists on site.
   The Soviet scientists arrived earlier this year to begin
preparing for next month's joint verification experiment. The
Soviet scientists will monitor a U.S. test in mid-August and U.S.
scientists will monitor a Soviet test a month later.
   The experiments are designed to determine the ability of each
country to monitor the size of the other's tests. Such monitoring
capabilities are critical in test limitation treaties.
   The DOE had issued a warning to managers of high-rise buildings
in Las Vegas not to have workers in precarious positions at the
time of today's detonation. Such warnings are issued only when the
test is near 150 kilotons, the upper limits allowable under
U.S.-Soviet treaties.
   The nuclear device was buried 2,000 feet beneath the surface of
Pahute Mesa, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   The most recent previous test was June 22, when two nuclear
devices were detonated simultaneously in a rare experiment.
