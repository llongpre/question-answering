   Your Nov. 11 page-one article on the U.S. attempt to
deport the "LA Eight" for their alleged affiliation with the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine characterizes
the case as symbolizing a "conundrum": "How can a government
protect the public from political violence without trampling
the rights of those it suspects of aiding or carrying out
terrorist activities?" In fact, the case presents no such
conundrum, because the U.S. has admitted from the outset that
these individuals have committed no crimes whatsoever.
   No less an authority than William Webster, then-director
of the FBI, has given the LA Eight a clean bill of health.
Testifying in Congress shortly after their arrest, he stated
that they had committed no crimes whatsoever, and that if
they were U.S. citizens the U.S. could do nothing against
them. If they had aided or carried out "terrorist
activities," they would be guilty of several criminal
offenses, but according to the FBI, they had not.

   The Immigration and Naturalization Service's recent
actions in the case underscore the lack of evidence that the
LA Eight have committed or assisted in any terrorist acts. In
October, an immigration judge ordered the INS to choose
whether to proceed under the new immigration law's
"terrorism" provisions, or under the old McCarran-Walter Act
provisions, which base deportation not on terrorist acts but
on advocacy of ideas. (Although Congress repealed the
McCarran-Walter Act last year, it let pending cases proceed
under the repealed act.) Notwithstanding the INS's loose
charges of "terrorism," the agency chose to proceed under the
advocacy charges.
   Thus, the conundrum posed by this case is not how to deal
with terrorists, but how to deal with a government that uses
accusations of terrorism as a cover for deporting people
solely for their political ideas.
