   A brisk batch of cool air swept across the eastern half of the
nation today, breaking record low temperatures from New England to
Texas.
   In Las Vegas, fierce winds registering at 99 mph overturned
private airplanes at McCarran International Airport, and an
accompanying storm caused power outages and minor flooding late
Tuesday.
   The cool air was ushered in by a large high pressure system,
dropping early morning temperatures into the 50s and 60s across the
eastern half of the nation, and into the 40s over the northern and
central Appalachians.
   Record low temperatures were set in Chattanooga, Tenn., with a
reading of 57 degrees; in Hartford, Conn., with a reading of 50
degress; in Houston with 66 degrees; in Mobile, Ala., with 63
degrees; in San Angelo, Texas, with 60 degrees; and in Youngstown,
Ohio, with 44 degrees.
   Temperatures were warmer across the Gulf Coast and the western
third of the nation.
   Florida was hit by scattered showers this morning, with
thunderstorms over the coastal waters of the south Atlantic and
Gulf Coast states.
   Earlier Tuesday evening, a thunderstorm in northeast Florida,
near the Putnam and Volusia County line, produced 1-inch hail and
wind gusts over 60 miles an hour. Lightning set a house on fire in
Putnam County.
   The severe thunderstorm struck Las Vegas with wind gusts to 99
miles an hour Tuesday night, turning over 80 airplanes at the Sky
Harbor and McCarran airports. No injuries were reported.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the Carolinas to Florida and the eastern half of the Gulf
Coast; showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon and evening
across the intermountain region and the northern and central
Rockies, and most numerous over the Great Basin area.
   Temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s from the Great Lakes
and the eastern half of the Ohio Valley across the Appalachians to
the northern and Middle Atlantic Coast; in the 60s or 70s along the
Pacific Coast; in the 90s over the Florida Peninsula and from the
southern half of Texas across the southern Plateau to the interior
valleys of California; above 100 degrees over the Desert Southwest;
and in the 80s across the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 43 degrees at Bradford,
