   The insurance industry is so protected by a
federal antitrust exemption that a few executives are able to
exercise immense control over rates and who should receive
liability insurance, the Texas attorney general told a Senate panel.
   ``The leaders of the property and casualty insurance industry
meet constantly to discuss their profits, their losses and their
objectives for the future,'' Jim Mattox told the Senate antitrust
committee on Tuesday.
   ``They sit aroud the table in the board rooms of ISO (Insurance
Services Office) and they do what no other industry can do - by
meeting together, talking together, planning together, strategizing
together - and I might say, conspiring together,'' he said.
   Mattox and his counterparts in New York and Massachusetts are
urging Congress to strip the insurance industry of its antitrust
exemption.
   Robert Abrams of New York, president-elect of the National
Association of Attorneys General, said Congress ``should repeal the
anomalous and anachronistic McCarran-Ferguson Act, thereby
requiring the insurance industry to operate within the same basic
competitive framework which has served American business and
consumers so well.''
   The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed in 1945, grants the antitrust
exemption. A number of states have filed suit alleging that dozens
of insurance companies conspired under the exemption to create the
liability insurance crisis of 1985-86, which made coverage
unavailable or too costly for many governments and businesses.
   Mattox, Abrams and James A. Shannon of Massachusetts also called
for the replacement of the data-gathering function of Insurance
Services Office (ISO), the primary industry rate and trade advisory
organization, with the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic
Analysis or another existing federal agency.
   They also recommended the establishment of strong American
reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance markets in an effort to
halt the flow of money overseas where, they said, almost all the
reinsurance companies are located.
   Reinsurance is insurance purchased by insurers to help pay
claims that they in turn must pay. Similarly, retrocessional
coverage is insurance for reinsurers.
   Craig A. Berrington, general counsel of the American Insurance
Association which represents 183 property-casualty companies, said
there is no need to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act because state
insurance agencies have the tools to regulate the industry in their
states.
   He said the lawsuits raise ``important public policy questions
about the role of state regulation of insurance, the true causes of
the liability crisis and the extent of competition in the insurance
business.''
