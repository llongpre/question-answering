   Fire still smoldered today at a 400-foot
crater in the ruins of a rocket fuel plant destroyed by
earthquake-force explosions that flattened an industrial park,
leaving one person dead, one missing and injuring more than 250.
   ``This thing could have been much worse. ... We may have a
miracle on our hands here,'' Gov. Richard Bryan said late Wednesday
after blasts shattered windows 10 miles away in Las Vegas and
tweaked seismographs 200 miles away.
   The detonations destroyed or severely damaged 12 buildings at
the site of the Pacific Engineering and Production Co. of Nevada
plant and an adjoining marshmallow factory.
   The blasts _ at least three powerful concussions and a string of
lesser explosions _ peeled off roofs, upended cars and even rocked
a jetliner in flight. More than 250 people were injured, four
critically, most from flying glass.
   The tattered body found in the ruins was identified today as
Bruce Bernard Halker, 56, vice president of operations at Pacific
Engineering. A search continued for another possible victim.
   ``We have a missing person but we're not sure what it is. Maybe
the person just left and hasn't contacted anyone,'' said Clark
County Deputy Fire Chief John Pappageorge.
   Bryan said he was declaring the blast zone and its environs a
state disaster area, and would seek federal disaster relief for
this southern Nevada desert community of 54,000.
   ``All the windows are smashed in and the roofs are peeled
back,'' the governor said. ``In one shopping center, all the glass
is blown out and the top part of the building caved in. The force
had to be enormous.''
   This morning fire still smoldered at the ruined plant, said
Pappageorge, but it was not threatening or causing firefighters any
problems. The blasts left a crater 400 feet across.
   ``Right now there are no fumes that are emitting from the ruins
that we're aware of,'' Pappageorge said on the CBS ``This Morning''
program. ``The last measurement that was taken, the particles were
measured at zero.''
   He said of the low death toll: ``Unbelievable would be the word.
As my first thoughts when I arrived out there was there would
probably be several hundred. But it's remarkable there was only
one.''
   The explosions also spewed a 5-square-mile plume of toxic smoke
into the sky, but winds carried the cloud away from populated areas
and it eventually dissipated. By nightfall, evacuated residents
were back at home.
   Pacific is one of two manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate, an
oxidizer in fuel for the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters and
the Minuteman and Titan missiles. The other is Kerr-McGee, also
near Las Vegas.
   The explosions and fire were caused by an equipment malfunction,
said Pacific president Fred Gibson Jr. No monetary estimate of the
damage was available.
   The first explosion at 11:53 a.m. measured about 3.0 on the
Richter scale and the second at 11:57 a.m. had a magnitude 3.5,
said Bob Finn, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology, 200 miles away in Pasadena.
   ``I find that absolutely amazing. That is extremely powerful,''
said Finn.
   ``It flipped cars over, knocked pedestrians to the ground and
windows in the whole town shattered,'' said Susan Russo, 37, of
Henderson, who was in her pickup truck when the blasts occurred.
   ``It felt like somebody sent me back to Vietnam,'' said Rick
Rieckmann, 41, a maintenance welder who was one of four plant
workers hurled through a wall in the first blast.
   ``It blew us out of the building. It sent us through a
fiberglass wall and into the desert,'' Rieckmann said. None of the
four was seriously hurt.
   Gamblers briefly abandoned gaming tables at several casinos on
the outskirts of Las Vegas, but ducked back inside after it was
clear the danger had passed.
   A Las Vegas-bound jetliner approaching McCarran International
Airport was rattled by the blasts, said America West passenger John
Conrad, 62, of Westlake Village, Calif.
   ``We felt a little jolt. The second explosion looked like a
mini-atomic bomb,'' he said. ``There was a tall column of smoke
going up 20,000 feet.''
   The Pacific plant employed about 300 workers, and about 200 of
them on duty Wednesday fled seconds before the first blast, Fire
Chief Roy Parrish said.
   ``Employees tried to put the fire out but it got out of control.
... Most of the employees had exited the building or were in the
foothills when the first explosion occurred. Seconds later, there
was a second explosion that completely demolished the building,''
Parrish said.
   Kidd &amp; Co., based in Ligonier, Ind., expanded to the Gibson
Business Park and opened its 36,500-square-foot marshmallow plant
about two years ago. It employed 85 people, but only 25 to 35 were
on duty at the time of the blast.
