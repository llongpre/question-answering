<LEADPARA>  Insurers and attorneys general from 19 states squared off Friday in the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to determine the scope of
federal antitrust exemptions afforded to insurance companies.;    At issue was
whether 32 insurers -- including Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, Hartford Insurance and
Lloyd's of London -- could effectively force the rest of the industry to
restrict certain types of coverage by virtue of antitrust exemptions under the
McCarran-Ferguson Act.  </LEADPARA>

COURT TO WEIGH SCOPE OF EXEMPTIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Normally, collusive activity in industry is barred by federal law. But
insurers operate under special rules that allow them to share forms and
price-setting information provided they do not take part in a market boycott
or force compliance through coercion or intimidation.;    In this case,
several states and about two dozen private companies alleged that insurers had
conspired to limit liability coverage in the mid-1980s by changing policy
forms that were commonly used in the industry.;    Although insurers deny the
allegations, Friday's arguments did not deal with the merits of this
individual case. Instead, three appellate judges were asked to determine how
broadly the McCarran-Ferguson exemptions should be interpreted. They also were
asked to decide whether U.S. laws could be used to restrict the activity of
foreign insurers, such as Lloyd's of London.;    Attorneys from both sides
expressed confidence on the final outcome of the case, but they stressed that
the issue was not likely to be completely resolved soon. The justices have an
indefinite amount of time to decide the case, and attorneys said they expect
that the loser will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.;    "This is years away
from resolution," said Thomas Greene, supervising deputy attorney general in
California's antitrust division.;    The case, which was originally filed in
1988, was spurred by the mayor of Lafayette, who complained that he was unable
to find liability coverage for the small Northern California town in 1985,
Greene said.;    The California attorney general's office began a two-year
investigation and determined that Hartford Insurance, in an attempt to limit
its own risk, illegally persuaded other major players in the industry to
shrink the scope of liability coverage in the mid-1980s. That allegedly led to
a nationwide insurance crisis, in which companies and cities found they could
not get adequate protection for certain risks at a reasonable cost.;    The
California attorney general filed suit. About 18 other states and several
private companies joined in while the case bounced through the court system.; 
  Friday's hearing was to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Judge William
Schwarzer that said the insurers could not be prosecuted for the alleged
conspiracy because they were protected by McCarran-Ferguson.  </TEXT>
