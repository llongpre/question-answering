   WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee approved
legislation that would narrow the insurance industry's
antitrust exemption. The move sends the measure to the House
floor for a vote as early as February.
   The bill, approved 19-14, would do away with the
industry's most prized possession, its broad exemption from
federal antitrust strictures granted under a 46-year-old law
known as the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Consumer groups contend
that the law, which allows insurance companies to share
actuarial information, also lets them fix prices and shield
themselves from antitrust suit.

   Similar to a bill the committee approved last year, it
would prevent the insurance industry from fixing prices,
monopolizing markets or engaging in other anticompetitive
behavior.
   Consumer lobbyists predicted that the bill would be
considered by the full House in February, and shortly after
that by the Senate. "This is the year of the insurance
consumer," said Linda Lipsen, legislative counsel for
Consumers Union, which pushed for the bill.
   Defenders of the industry said the bill could make
insurers less stable financially and could actually impose
tougher antitrust rules on insurers than on other industries.
"They will have less actuarial information," said Rep.
Hamilton Fish of New York, the committee's senior Republican.
"We are affecting the accuracy of the decisions that they
make."
   The antitrust exemption is particularly critical to
property and casualty insurers. The American Insurance
Association, which represents 254 large property-casualty
companies, broke with the industry earlier this year, to try
to negotiate a version of the bill that the industry finds
less onerous. David Pratt, the group's lobbyist, held out
hope that a compromise might still be struck before the House
takes up the bill. "The heartening thing for us is that we do
have time," he said.
   But Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, sounded resolute about passage. "This is
the bill that the insurance industry loved when it was
offered as an alternative to the repeal of the
McCarran-Ferguson law," he said. "There is always the clear,
straightforward alternative: simply repeal
McCarran-Ferguson."
   An outright repeal of the law would be worse, insurers
say. It would subject the industry to Federal Trade
Commission consumer provisions, as well as antitrust law.
Insurance advertising, for example, could fall under FTC
scrutiny, which is barred now. Relationships between
insurance companies and insurance agents that spell out the
sorts of products that agents may sell could be regulated, as
well.
   The bill includes an amendment backed by Rep. Dan Glickman
(D., Kansas) that would allow some small and medium-size
companies to continue to share some actuarial information.
"These small companies fill gaps in the market," Rep.
Glickman said. The amendment, he said, would make it less
likely that they would be merged or consolidated out of
existence.
   At least two similar bills have been introduced in the
Senate, but action isn't expected until after the House
finishes its work on the measure.
