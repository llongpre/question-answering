   Southwest Airlines had the best record while
Eastern Airlines and Northwest Airlines shared the burden of having
the poorest on-time performance in January, according to the
monthly government statistics on flight delays.
   The Transportation Department figures released Wednesday showed
about three out of every ten flights arrived at least 15 minutes
late during the month, slightly fewer than in December.
   Southwest, which consistently has been among the best on-time
performers, had 85 percent of its flights arrive on time during
January, followed by America West and Pacific Southwest Airlines,
both of which had a better than 80 percent on-time performance.
   Eastern airlines had the worst record, with 61.5 percent of its
flights arriving on time, followed close behind by Northwest's 61.6
percent. Piedmont Airlines, which also had the highest baggage
complaint rate during the month, was third from the bottom with a
62.4 percent on-time record.
   Overall the 14 airlines that are monitored in the monthly report
had 69.2 percent of their flights arriving within 15 minutes of
schedule, compared with 66.4 percent in December.
   The government considers a flight to be on time if it arrives
within 15 minutes of schedule. The 14 airlines that are required to
submit monthly on-time statistics are not required to report delays
attributed to mechanical problems. Delays due to weather are
counted.
   During January, there were 148 chronically late flights, meaning
they were late at least 80 percent of the time. Four of those
flights _ two for Continental and one each for Northwest and Delta
Airlines _ were late each time the planes flew.
   Meanwhile, consumer complaints to the Transportation Department
dropped sharply in February, compared with the previous month, but
still were higher than the number recorded in February 1987, the
department said.
   The complaint statistics are released with the on-time
performance statistics, although they cover different months.
   There were 2,235 complaints received by the department's
consumer affairs office about airline service during February,
compared with 3,610 in January, a decline of 38 percent. The
department received 1,574 such complaints in February 1987.
   The three airlines that had the most complaints lodged against
them in the two previous months _ Continental, Eastern and
Northwest _ led the list again in February. There were 14.79
complaints per 100,000 passengers involving Continental, 11.3
complaints involving Eastern and 10.64 complaints involving
Northwest, the deparment said.
   After Southwest, the airlines with the best on-time performance
in January were America West, which also was No. 2 in December, and
Pacific Southwest Airlines, which soared from last among the 14
airlines in December to having the third best record in January.
   America West had 83.9 percent of its flights arrive on time in
January while Pacific Southwest improved its record from 57.6 in
December to 81.6 in January. American Airlines (75.7 percent) had
the best record among the larger carriers, but Pan American World
Airways dropped from having the second best record in December to
seventh in January.
   The best arrival rate among the 27 airports from which reporting
is required came at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport and
the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport with just over 78 percent of the
flights arriving on time. The worst arrival rate, 59.1 percent, was
reported at Orlando International Airport in Florida.
   During January, the number of baggage complaints received by the
airlines remained virtually the same as the previous month with
11.58 complaints per 1,000 passengers flown. Piedmont Airlines had
just over 18 such complaints, the most of any of the airlines,
while Southwest had the least at 4.65.
