<HEADLINE>  AMERICA WEST MAY CUT SERVICE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     McCarran International Airport here serves as a second hub for the
Phoenix-based airline. America West provides 36 percent of the service at
McCarran and ranks as the airport's No. 1 carrier.;    Beauvais, speaking to
the Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial board, said Las Vegas service could be
reduced from 145 flights daily to 120 or 125. Service from Las Vegas to
Atlanta, which was scheduled to begin Aug. 30, is now in doubt, he said.;   
Other cuts might include shorter flights between Las Vegas and various
California markets, he said.;    America West filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection June 28. It has not made its $1.5 million payment due July 1 for
leased space at McCarran. Airport spokesman John Hanks says the airline, which
has another $500,000 payment due on Monday for landing fees, has requested a
30-day extension.;    The reorganization includes negotiating fees with
airports it serves, Beauvais said. The airline does not expect a major change
in McCarran's fees for space rental and landing fees.;    "We don't anticipate
an extension being granted without some commitment from their side on the
future of all payments," Hanks said.;    The airline is also negotiating with
Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix on $2.2 million it owes in monthly fees.;   
Beauvais said Las Vegas is a "dynamic" market for the airline and figures
prominently in America West's long-range expansion plans when it emerges from
Chapter 11.;    The fleet size and level of service for the airline will
depend on a plan being formulated in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix,
Beauvais said. The reorganization plan is expected to be completed within two
months.  </TEXT>
