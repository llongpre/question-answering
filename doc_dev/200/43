   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When Hollywood producers take their cameras to
Nevada, as they are doing more and more these days, they rely on a
former New York model to pave the way and round up a cast of
extras. She's Christine O'Rourke, who operates the only movie
location management company in the state.

   It takes a lot of chutzpah to close down
a busy section of Interstate 15, orchestrate a simulated shootout
in a crowded airport lobby, or fake the firebombing of a casino on
the Las Vegas Strip.
   But for a former New York model, such challenges have become
routine.
   Christine O'Rourke, who saw dreams of a modeling career derailed
19 years ago, now runs the only licensed movie casting and location
management company in Nevada.
   In that role, she finds her ingenuity tested almost daily by
Hollywood producers, taking part in the production of films such as
``Rain Man,'' which won the Oscar as the best picture of 1988,
``Midnight Run,'' ``Heat,'' ``Starman'' and the television series
``Crime Story.''
   Her toughest assignment was setting up a scene in which a casino
was firebombed _ a near impossible feat in a city where gaming
executives are skittish about even having photographs taken in
their establishments.
   The firebombing was shot for one of the episodes of the TV
series ``Crime Story.''
   ``We had to clear everything through security, deal with fire
codes, get clearance of city and county officials, etc.,'' O'Rourke
recalls, sitting in an office lined with autographed photos of
stars with whom she's worked. ``We had to practice the scene, then
shut down the entire casino operation to make it work.''
   Another scene involved tossing a Molotov cocktail in a
restaurant.
   ``It takes a lot of finesse to get an owner to let you do
something like that,'' she says, laughing.
   She found herself enlisting the aid of the governor's office in
closing a section of I-15, the main artery between Las Vegas and
Los Angeles, to film a scene for ``Starman.''
   On other occasions, has cleared a mountain of legal and public
relations problems to close down sections of the Las Vegas Strip
and downtown's Glitter Gulch.
   ``You've got to get the approval of every casino owner who's
affected,'' she explains. ``You've got to go to all the property
owners, even the guy who runs the hot dog stand and the owner of
the pawnshop. If just one of them says no, it's my job to convince
them it would be good for them.''
   O'Rourke handled the Nevada locations and casting of extras for
``Rain Man.''
   But she found ``Midnight Run'' one of her toughest challenges,
especially a scene filmed at McCarran International Airport in Las
Vegas.
   ``These people were sticklers for realism,'' she recalls. ``They
wanted real cops, real FBI agents. They said, `If you can't get us
real cops and FBI men, we'll find someone who can.'''
   O'Rourke found herself calling powerful Clark County Sheriff
John Moran in the pre-dawn hours one day to enlist his aid in the
search for extras. She delivered, and the airport scene, involving
400 extras, was one of the more dramatic segments of the hit film.
   The airport scene was not without its problems.
   She blocked off the ticketing counters at the busy facility,
filming overnight when traffic was lightest.
   ``We had signs up to indicate we were filming, but it still
caused a scene when someone shouted, `Look out, he's got a gun,'
and everyone started pulling guns,'' she says.
   Martin Sheen needed soldiers in his upcoming movie
``Nightbreaker.'' The extras were to portray American servicemen
used in atmospheric nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site in the
1950s. Veterans have contended they were subjected to radioactive
fallout from the testing, a charge denied by the government.
   The sensitive nature of the film ruled out government agencies
as a source for the extras. So O'Rourke recruited high school and
college ROTC students to provide the needed manpower.
   She enlisted the aid of the principal at her children's
elementary school when a producer wanted two Eskimo kids, a
Russian-looking youngster, and a 10-year-old Mr. T look-alike.
   The heady world of Hollywood was something of a natural
progression for O'Rourke, 38, who began modeling in her hometown of
San Jose, Calif. at the age of 15. She headed for New York City two
years later, modeling for magazines such as ``Seventeen.''
   That career came to a halt when she married at the age of 19. A
divorce, then a move to Las Vegas nine years ago found her
searching for a new career while trying to support her children,
Patrick, 13, and Tara, 12.
   She started Spectrum Services, her location and casting company,
on less than $100.
   The use of Nevada locations in filming motion pictures is
growing annually, with direct film revenues to the state topping
$50 million last year _ 10 times the revenues generated five years
ago.
   Much of Nevada's recent success in wooing Hollywood producers
can be attributed to Robert Hirsch and his state Motion Picture
Division.
   Las Vegas offers many attractive features for filmmakers,
O'Rourke says.
   ``This is a 24-hour town,'' she says. ``You can film anytime of
the day or night. There's a lot of lore and history. It's an
attractive area.
   ``And Nevada is something of a last frontier. It's the last
state where you can come in and do a tremendous amount of things
without a lot of red tape.''
