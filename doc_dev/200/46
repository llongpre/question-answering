   An American Bar Association study panel on
Tuesday recommended federal regulation of the insurance industry.
   The 12-member ABA commission called for repeal of the 43-year-old
McCarran-Ferguson Act, in which Congress generally left insurance
regulation to the states.
   The commission, in a 183-page report, also urged that an agency
with subpoena powers investigate whether improper industry collusion
manipulates insurance availability and cost.
   The commission concluded that some collusion among insurers is
permitted under federal law, and said it was unable to assess
whether improper collusion has occurred.
   The commission's report will be presented to the ABA's
policy-making House of Delegates when it convenes in Denver in
February. The ABA is the nation's largest organization of lawyers.
   George Klotzbaugh, an American Insurance Association attorney,
termed the report's call for repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act
``misguided.''
   ``The report professes to support continued regulation by the
states but the changes it recommends ... would dictate to the states
how they have to regulate,'' he said. Klotzbaugh added that federal
antitrust law would become the chief regulatory tool.
   Trial lawyers and the insurance industry have been fighting for
years over who is to blame for the skyrocketing costs of liability
insurance.
   In recent years, numerous states have sued insurers and other
defendants, accusing them of illegally conspiring to limit the
availability of commercial liability insurance.
