   (During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

   PRESIDENT TRUMAN'S LAST OFFICIAL ACT, four days before he left the White House on Jan. 20, 1953, had his usual give-em-hell style. 
It angered Democrats, particularly in oil-rich Texas. 

   His executive order set aside as a federal petroleum reserve the undersea area up to 150 milles off U.S. coastlines. 
The prior May 29, Truman had vetoed a bill that would have given California, Louisiana and Texas title to offshore oil and gas, then reportedly valued at $100 billion. 

   Truman had said he wouldn't turn the "vast treasure over to a handful of states, where the powerful private oil interests hope to exploit it to suit themselves." 

   The vetoed bill had been sponsored by Sen. Pat McCarran, the renegade Nevada Democrat with whom Truman had fought since his Senate days. 
His daughter, Margaret, later wrote that her dad disliked McCarran "both personally and politically." 
Another biographer uses the word "despise." 

   After Truman left, the oil lobby and offshore oil states resumed their fight and won in 1953 the Submerged Lands Act, which restored to the states underwater oil and gas rights -- but only for distances 3 to 10.5 miles offshore. 
President Eisenhower, signing it May 22, said: "I deplore and I will always resist federal encroachment upon the rights . . . of states." 
But an act of Aug. 7, 1953 (the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act) kept U.S. ownership of oil-gas assets up to 150 miles beyond those state boundaries. 

   Since 1954, the outer shelf properties have produced $189 billion of natural gas and oil, generating $84 billion in revenue to the U.S. Treasury. 
There are billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of gas down there that remain for drillers. 
But both federal and state restrictions on new auctions of offshore leases have been growing since 1981 because of environmental concerns.
