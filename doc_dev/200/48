   The State Department has relented and given
permission to one of Vietnam's leading economic policy-makers to
visit the United States, Rep. Chester G. Atkins and the American
Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday.
   Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a member of Vietnam's national assembly and an
advocate of economic liberalization, originally was denied entry
into the United States under a law permitting the State Department
to bar foreigners on grounds of national interest.
   Oanh, 66, a U.S.-trained economist who has held high-ranking
positions in both the U..S.-backed administration in South Vietnam
and the communist government that unified Vietnam in 1975, applied
in March to come to the United States to speak at Harvard and other
universities.
   The department has sought to limit visits by Vietnamese,
particularly those involved in the economy, to keep Vietnam in
economic isolation as long as it maintains an estimated 120,000
troops in neighboring Cambodia. The United States has had no
diplomatic relations with Vietnam since 1975.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the department changed its mind on Oanh because recent legal
rulings prohibit the widespread use of ``national interest'' under
the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act to deny visas.
   Atkins, a Massachusetts Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said, ``The State Department's original indication that
it would deny him a visa under the misbegotten McCarran-Walter Act
was a mistake, and I am gratified that the administration has
changed its mind.''
   Atkins said Oanh is ``an advocate of moving his country out of
its economic isolation and toward some limited free-market
policies.''
   He and seven other members of Congress said in a letter to
Secretary of State George P. Shultz that despite U.S.
non-recognition of the Vietnamese government ``it is possible and
we believe healthy to understand some of the latest policy
developments there.''
   ``Dr. Oanh is a very sophisticated, highly trained academic who
is likely to take back some very keen insights about the United
States,'' the legislators said. ``Allowing a few tentative steps
toward an academic exchange can only suggest the possibilities that
one day would accrue to Vietnam once impediments to normalization
are resolved.''
   Kate Martin, director of the ACLU's national security litigation
project, said her group was involved on Oanh's behalf with the
State Department legal office.
   The United States has hinged improvements in relations with
Vietnam on withdrawal from Cambodia and the best possible
accounting for the estimated 1,700 Americans still listed as
missing from the Vietnam War.
   The next opportunity for a high-level U.S.-Vietnamese meeting
will come in early June, when Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach
comes to New York to attend a United Nations disarmament conference.
   There were no plans for any U.S. official of equal or near-equal
rank to meet Thach, although a session is expected between Thach
and retired Gen. John W. Vessey, who is President Reagan's special
representative on behalf of the missing U.S. servicemen.
