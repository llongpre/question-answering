<TEXT>     "He's the handsomest man I've ever seen," Amo said after an emotional
embrace with 46-year-old James Warnack, who dated Amo's mother in the 1960s
before he was shipped to Vietnam with the Marines.;   "For us, this is day
one. It starts here," said Warnack, who flew from Ohio to meet his 26-year-old
son and take part in his wedding Saturday night.;   Amo's mother, Patricia
Pierce of Carson City, also was at the airport with her husband, James.
Accompanying Warnack was his wife, Charlotte.;   Patricia Pierce said the
quest began in April, when she went to see the Traveling Wall memorial in
Carson City.;   A mutual friend had told her in 1965 that Warnack was killed
in action, but she could not find his name on the monument, and the Marine
Corps refused to provide any information to settle her doubts.;   Remembering
he was from Ohio, Patricia Pierce called the Department of Motor Vehicles
there and located him in Streetsboro.;   "He was a little angry with me,
because I hadn't called him sooner," she said. "Then I explained to him that I
thought he was dead, and he understood."  </TEXT>
