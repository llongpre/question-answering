   SPARKS, Nev. -- The family-owned Clarkson Co. moved to
this twin city of Reno in 1986 for some of the same reasons
that have attracted other manufacturers to the Truckee River
Meadows. Land costs weren't a barrier to expansion, as in its
former home of Palo Alto, Calif. Housing was at a price that
the company's young work force could afford. Taxes were low,
both for the employees and the owners. And the area was a hub
for one-day trucking to the prosperous greater Northwest.
   For Clarkson, which specializes in valves used for mining,
northern Nevada had the added attraction of a booming gold
industry, revitalized astride what, a century after the
Comstock Lode, are again the nation's top fields. Although
activity has tapered off with weakness in gold prices over
the past year, direct employment in the local industry is
triple what it was in 1985, according to John Dobra, an
economist and consultant. Mr. Dobra calculates that the
indirect effect, as reflected at businesses such as Clarkson,
has been even greater.

   Not everything in this more-established but less-visible
part of Nevada took off in the past decade, a period when the
state, led by its burgeoning south, was the fastest growing
in the nation. Reno-Sparks suffered overhang in its gaming
business and actually grew more slowly in population than in
the 1970s. This is one of many differences with the Las Vegas
area, which is now twice as populous and effectively exists
in a separate regional economy from the northern belt.
   Nevada gambling began in the north and still is important
here, but few travel far to this part of the state. It has
relied on proximity to the San Francisco Bay Area for
visitors and for businesses fleeing high-price, high-tax
California. It has two-thirds of the state's manufacturing
employment. Mining is the highest paid of any major
employment category. This region thus may be more affected by
the fiscal debate that has occupied state officials in nearby
Carson City for most of this year.
   The governor and legislators seem intent on raising about
$300 million in taxes over two years, though they can't
settle on how to pay the bill. If they exempt gaming -- which
already carries 40% of the state load -- it means about a 20%
boost for the rest of the economy. The governor wants a 1%
payroll levy, which smells of income taxation in a state that
has avoided that. The Legislature drifts between a different
type of business charge and a boost in sales taxes, which
wouldn't be as steady an income source should the long-lucky
state get dealt a bad hand. California Gov. Pete Wilson's
proposed leap in sales taxes gives Nevada cover to take
similar action.
   As might be expected, all sides are pointing in someone
else's direction. Organized business interests seem most
averse to the payroll tax, which could require an intrusive
collection apparatus where one hasn't been needed. The mining
industry, for its part, was hit two years ago with stiffer
state levies on top of longtime local taxes, and argues it is
at a constitutional maximum. The casinos, with their
extraordinary influence in Carson City -- the venerable
Ormsby House, for instance, is cater-corner to the capitol --
appear safe from another increase.
   For a business such as Clarkson, the effect of a big boost
in general business taxes wouldn't be critical but could be
enough to cost one job from the 72-person payroll. The
nonunion operation pays from $7 to $14 an hour, according to
Vice President Omer King.
   Nevada has a spending problem because of a school-age
demographic bulge, including at the state university where
enrollment controls have been lax. The incarceration rate per
capita is the highest in the U.S. -- 11% of those in state
prison are there for driving while intoxicated -- and its
police forces are outsized. And its low population base,
separated by great distances, has meant high overhead costs
that seem only to get worse as more people come. Chambers of
commerce are urging some progress on privatization and on
consolidation of services in areas such as Reno and Sparks,
whose separation is an historical artifact.
   Local government continues to have a wild streak. The
mayor of Reno, whose wife appeared in Playboy, was re-elected
last week, while the mayor of Sparks was ousted by a former
sportscaster. The elections, with a turnout of 58%, signaled
opposition to growth, notwithstanding the relative pause of
the '80s and the fact that shelter is already so tight that
the job-hungry, who traditionally flock to Nevada in tough
times, rent cheap motel rooms by the week. Despite a
persistent water shortage (no wonder -- it's unmetered), a
plan to buy rights from lands to the north are threatened
because residents think the water will encourage new casinos
to blossom.
   Although Las Vegas has four times the number of guest
rooms as Reno/Sparks and pulls in six times the gambling
revenue in its still-surging betting palaces, tourism remains
vital to Truckee Meadows as well. The north is hobbled by
lack of traffic through Reno's Cannon Airport, which grew
only 20% from 1980-90, while at Las Vegas's McCarran Aiport
it doubled. Washoe County (Reno) is blessed with an unusually
large Latino population by Nevada standards -- nearly 10% --
that shores up its work force. In another curious contrast
with Las Vegas, the black share of the Washoe population is
only a fifth as large.
   The cowboy culture survives in Reno, where an annual rodeo
is a major event. It lives on, too, in the high-risk,
high-reward quest for gold in the hills. These days, some
prospectors are big operators; too big, some think, in the
case of Newmont Mining and American Barrick, which plan to
merge. Side players, such as the Clarkson Co., also plan to
grow. Vice President Hank Frohlich describes how the company,
now at $14 million in annual sales and an accomplished
exporter, is vertically integrating production so it can
develop new rubberlike compounds for its valves.
   Nevada's future prosperity, once gambling cools off, may
rest on maintaining an environment that fosters
private-sector expansion. Some believe this entails public
expenditures such as the mining program at the University of
Nevada-Reno, said to be among the best half-dozen in the
country. Just as likely a contributor, however, is the
low-tax regime that until lately has placed the state second
only to New Hampshire as a safe haven for earnings and
wealth. Maintaining that mark of distinction means government
has to keep its hands off the chips.
