   The nation's top immigration appeals official
took part three ago in a secret committee that shaped plans to
apprehend and deport alien terrorists, according to government
documents.
   It was ``a clear conflict of interest'' for David Milhollan to
serve on a policy-making panel while he supervised the immigration
courts, said Marc Van Der Hout, attorney for eight Los Angeles-area
immigrants fighting deportation.
   Van Der Hout said Milhollan's dual functions prejudiced a
government case against the immigrants _ seven Palestinians and a
Kenyan.
   In a legal brief, Justice Department lawyers argued that Van Der
Hout's allegations ``have no relevance'' to his clients' case
because the Immigration and Naturalization Service, not Milhollan,
filed the charges.
   Milhollan is director of the Executive Office for Immigration
Review in Falls Church, Va., which oversees the nation's two dozen
immigration courts and all immigration appeals.
   The Alien Border Control Committee on which Milhollan served
sought to ``expeditiously remove terrorist aliens found within the
United States'' and deport ``alien activists who are not in
conformity with their immigration status,'' according to the
documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information act.
   Also on the panel were the director of the Justice Department's
Office of Immigration Litigation, which is prosecuting Van Der
Horn's clients, and representatives of the FBI, the CIA and the
State Department.
   ``It's outrageous that a government official, supposed to be
sitting in a judicial capacity, would be meeting with the
prosecutorial arm of the agency whose cases he's reviewing,'' Van
Der Hout said.
   ``It's like a federal judge meeting with prosecutors in advance
of trying a case,'' he said.
   Van Der Hout and other lawyers for the immigrants have petitioned
U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson to summon Milhollan to testify
about his role.
   The eight immigrants were arrested in January 1987 and jailed for
almost two weeks on charges that they belonged to a Palestinian
group with a history of terrorism, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   In December, Wilson overturned several key provisions of the
McCarran-Walter Act, which authorized the deportation of aliens who
advocate communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the unlawful
destruction of property.
   The government has appealed that decision.
