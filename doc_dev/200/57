   The 32 insurance-industry defendants named in the multistate antitrust suits conceded in court papers to having had "numerous communications" with each other about what type of insurance their companies should sell in the U.S. market. 

   But the defendants vigorously denied the suits' charges that they threatened to boycott the U.S. general-liability insurance market, unless certain coverage restrictions were adopted in industrywide policy forms. 

   "Any joint action by defendants was authorized and encouraged by state insurance regulators, involved (constitutionally) protected speech, and/or was procompetitive in purpose and effect," said the defendants, in a memo prepared for a court-held status conference on the case scheduled for next Thursday. 

   Separately, in Washington, the antitrust subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation yesterday that would repeal part of the insurance industry's exemption from federal antitrust laws. 

   Under that exemption, passed by Congress in 1944, insurers can share cost data and jointly set prices and policy language, provided those activities are regulated by the states. 
The subcommittee's bill would restore normal antitrust restrictions on insurers against price fixing and certain other collective practices. 

   In their court memo, the defendants cite the insurance-industry's antitrust exemption, called the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as a key rampart in their defense against the 19 state suits. 

   Although that act doesn't provide immunity for acts of "boycott, coercion or intimidation" -- the charges brought in the state suits -- the defendants argue that joint efforts to reduce policy coverage didn't constitute a boycott, as defined in previous judicial cases. 

   The crux of the insurers' argument is that the industry's collective revision of standard policy forms, which took place in 1984 and 1985, was "motivated by legitimate business reasons ... immune from antitrust challenge." 
Those reasons included recent court decisions, such as in asbestos and toxic-waste cases, making insurers liable for losses they never anticipated. 

   What's more, the defendants say in the memo that the forms-development process was closely scrutinized by state regulators, in accordance with the stipulation in the McCarran-Ferguson Act. 

   On the matter of the reinsurance defendants, charged in the suits with threatening a cutoff of reinsurance to the U.S. market if certain policy changes weren't made, the memo argues that any threats by them weren't directed at the plaintiffs (the public) but at other insurance companies. 
Therefore, the memo says, no public injury could have resulted and the suits are invalid. 

   The memo also states that the Britain-based reinsurers named in the suit plan to dispute the U.S. court's jurisdiction in the case. 
Reinsurers cover a portion of the risk underwritten by insurance companies and share in the premium. 

   In the memo, the defendants asked Judge William Schwarzer to force the attorneys general to produce more evidence gathered during the states' two-year conspiracy investigation of the industry. 
They also asked the judge to issue a protective order, obliging all parties in the case to keep evidentiary documents confidential. 

   The memo said there haven't been any substantive settlement discussions among the parties, "and none are planned."
