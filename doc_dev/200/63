   SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court revived a massive
lawsuit that alleged numerous big insurance companies
illegally conspired to control the insurance market during
the mid-1980s.
   The suit, filed by the California attorney general and 18
other states, was dismissed in 1989 by federal Judge William
Schwarzer. The action was considered a major test of the
industry's special status under federal antitrust law and
symbolized the broad national backlash against skyrocketing
insurance rates.

   The states had asserted the companies conspired to limit
liability coverage and drive up rates for businesses and
governments, amounting to an illegal boycott that limited the
availability of liability insurance in the U.S. Judge
Schwarzer held that the actions of the companies didn't
amount to a boycott and were thus legal under the protections
of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
   But a three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals disagreed, clearing the way for a possible trial. The
defendants include Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.; Allstate
Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co.; Hartford Fire
Insurance Co.; Cigna Corp.; and Lloyd's of London.
   "Obviously, we are very pleased. I think all of the states
have spent an enormous amount of time and effort to move the
case along," said Thomas Greene, deputy California attorney
general. He said he fully expected the defendant companies to
appeal the decision, but that meanwhile, "We are very pleased
that our characterization of the case was accepted by the
Ninth Circuit and that the court gave us a very stunning
victory."
   "This puts the case back in the trial court, where we
thought it should be all along," he added.
   The decision comes at a time of insurance regulation
upheaval. California, for instance, passed a law shortly
after the case was filed in 1988 that strips the industry of
its state antitrust immunity, and other states and federal
authorities are reexamining the antitrust issue. Texas
recently settled a similar suit in which it accused the
industry of anti-competitive practices in state court.
   McCarran-Ferguson, which Congress enacted in 1944, exempts
the "business of insurance" from antitrust prosecution,
provided the states regulate it. The immunity, however,
specifically excludes acts of "boycott, coercion or
intimidation."
   The states alleged that the Insurance Services Offices
Inc., a trade group based in New York, succumbed to pressure
from a small group of member companies in 1984 and rewrote
industry-wide policy standards to exclude coverage for
pollution damages and other risks. The suits contend the
exclusions precipitated a national crisis and amount to an
illegal boycott.
   The insurance defendants contend that their actions,
however collusive, amounted to merely conferring and agreeing
on terms on which insurance would be offered, which the law
permits.
   "The case is based on a fundamentally false premise that
there was some conspiracy to force purchasers of insurance to
accept a claims-made form, when in fact, the claims-made form
was a failure in the marketplace," said Richard de Saint
Phalle, an Oakland, Calif., attorney, who is liaison counsel
for the defendants. Under a "claims-made" form, only claims
made during the life of a policy are paid; by contrast, forms
insuring against "occurrences" of liability leave insurers
open to claims long after a policy has expired.
   "These attorneys general have to go back and put on a
case. We don't think they will be successful. The facts do
not bear out their own erroneous legal theories," added Mr.
de Saint Phalle, who said the industry hasn't decided upon
its next step in the litigation.
