An air fare is advertised for $298. But when you pay for your ticket, you 
notice you've been charged $305. Another air fare is marketed at $500. But upon 
departure, you're informed that another $12 is needed. Isolated incidents? 
Incorrect fare calculations? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Airline fare surcharges represent one of the more insulting, insidious 
and often misleading aspects of travel. 
</P>
<P>
These extra charges are now being placed on a variety of domestic and 
international flights. They are not always disclosed to passengers by the 
airlines or their travel agents, they often appear and disappear without 
notice, and they can add substantially to the cost of travel. 
</P>
<P>
Consider these current charges that are included as part of your airline fare: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 8% federal excise tax. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $6 international departure fee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $5 surcharge by certain U.S. airlines (Pan Am, American, TWA, United, Delta 
and Northwest) on their transatlantic routes to cover security costs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $2.50 fuel surcharge on most domestic flights originating in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $5 fuel surcharge for flights from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $2 fuel surcharge for flights departing from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $2.20 fuel add-on for flights leaving San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $1 to $2 surcharge on most domestic flights leaving Denver to finance 
airport terminal improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $2 one-way security surcharge for flights heading towards the Bahamas or 
Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign passengers coming into the United States from countries 
other than Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean are assessed a $5 U.S. Customs fee. 
</P>
<P>
Most passengers never know about these surcharges before they make their ticket 
purchases. And many travelers only discover the excess fees after they've 
completed their journey. 
</P>
<P>
Both passengers and travel agents aren't thrilled about the additional charges. 
</P>
<P>
"It sometimes puts us in a bad position," says Annette Alvarez, director of 
sales and marketing for the Travel Store, a Los Angeles travel agency, "because 
we have to explain extra charges that we had nothing to do with. 
</P>
<P>
"These surcharges may not be that big, but they do have an effect on the 
leisure traveler, who feels that he or she is being abused. If they're going to 
add these charges, why not throw in a free headset or drink as compensation?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because it is not a prudent business decision to do so," says one airline 
spokesman. "We are adding the surcharges because they are costs assessed 
against us that we didn't plan on when we established our fare structures. We 
need to find a way to recover these costs." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the surcharges keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
At this writing, there are a number of newly proposed surcharges that only 
promise to make air travel even more expensive: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $1 to $3 U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection charge for passengers 
coming into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $1 charge (called a "ticket-writing fee") to fund the U.S. Travel and 
Tourism Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $1, $2 or $3 Passenger Facilities Charge, to fund expansion and 
renovation at U.S. airports. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An increase in the current federal excise tax on domestic tickets, from 8% 
to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed excise tax increase has drawn the most fire. 
</P>
<P>
"That represents a 25% tax increase," says Drew Steketee, executive director of 
the Partnership for Improved Air Travel, "and we think that's excessive and 
unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the partnership (funded by 14 airlines and 19 manufacturers) has 
been fighting the management of the Aviation Trust Fund (where the excise tax 
dollars rest), claiming that the fund has a substantial surplus and is not used 
fully to improve the U.S. air travel system. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law that established the fund, the 8% tax currently included as part 
of your domestic air fare pays for 100% of new air-traffic control systems, a 
substantial portion of airport capacity improvements, and a partial funding of 
the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, passengers pay a federal excise tax of 8% on all domestic airline 
tickets. That tax generates $4 billion in revenues. (Since 1982, more than $31 
billion has been raised for the Aviation Trust Fund. Currently, the fund has a 
balance of $14 billion, of which only half has been earmarked for aviation 
project spending.) 
</P>
<P>
That leaves a surplus of $7 billion. "With that kind of surplus," Steketee 
argues, "you've got to ask what do they want the additional money for? 
Historically, this fund has a track record that stinks, and most consumers have 
difficulty understanding the need for more funds when current funds aren't 
being committed." 
</P>
<P>
In June, the partnership generated 10,000 letters from its membership to 
Congress opposing the new tax. 
</P>
<P>
Also pending before Congress is a bill that would create a Passenger Facility 
Charge, or PFC. It would allow a charge of $1, $2 or $3 -- depending on the 
size and operating costs of an airport -- to passengers for using that 
particular airport. The charge would be collected as part of the airline ticket 
price. 
</P>
<P>
But the PFC legislation, if passed, might cost passengers far more than $3. For 
example, a passenger flying round trip between Los Angeles and New York who 
changes planes at a hub airport en route in each direction could pay a PFC as 
high as $12. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation has passed the House and is being considered in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, some airlines have announced their own surcharges as a means of 
opposing local plans that would drive up their costs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after Las Vegas officials announced the expansion of an airport 
terminal, American Airlines argued -- unsuccessfully -- that the plans were too 
costly and that they would substantially increase the rent for terminal space 
that American paid in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
When McCarran Airport officials seemed to ignore American's protests, the 
airline announced that it was imposing a $7.50 per-passenger surcharge on Las 
Vegas flights to help cover the airline's higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon thereafter," reports one airline source, "the authorities reached an 
agreement with the airline, and the surcharge was dropped." 
</P>
<P>
American has since announced other surcharges, which were also dropped when no 
other competing carriers went along with the increases. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, the Port Authority of New York (which operates both J.F.K. 
and La Guardia airports) informed a number of airlines using La Guardia that it 
would be installing imported granite floors in many of the terminal areas, 
which would result in higher user costs to the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, American and United protested vigorously. "It was not only an 
excessive charge," says American spokesman Al Becker, "it was unrealistic. Who 
needs imported granite? It's not as durable as the high-strength tile we were 
already using in other areas of the terminal. But they were requiring us to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
American says it was also being hit with similarly excessive charges at four 
other airports. "We saw no other way to recover our costs," says Becker, "than 
to announce a surcharge." 
</P>
<P>
In early July, American announced a $1 to $4 "excess facilities" surcharge on 
departures and arrivals that were due to take effect last week at La Guardia, 
Newark, New Orleans, West Palm Beach and Ft. Myers, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
But when no other airline moved to match the surcharges, American quickly 
dropped them. 
</P>
<P>
The next time you make an airline reservation, double-check that the price 
quoted in advertisements is the actual price you will pay. If it is not, demand 
to know if there is a surcharge being added and, if so, the reason for the 
surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
If enough passengers complain -- to the airlines, to their travel agents and to 
their legislators -- there's a reasonably good chance that these annoying, and 
expensive, add-ons can be curtailed . . . or at least controlled.
