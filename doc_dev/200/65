   A line of storms moved off the Northeast coast this morning after
spawning tornadoes from northern New Jersey to central Massachusetts
and leaving at least two people dead and hundreds homeless.
   At least 10 tornadoes were reported Monday in the Northeast.
   In Connecticut, the storm did heavy damage to 40 to 60 homes, a
16-unit condominium and an industrial park in the town of Hamden,
and it tore off roofs and uprooted trees in Waterbury. Twenty-seven
people in Waterbury and 37 in New Haven were treated for minor
injuries.
   The storm cut off power to more than 112,000 people in
northwestern and southern Connecticut, said spokesmen for Northeast
Utilities and United Illuminating.
   A tornado overturned cars and damaged houses in Carmel and
Southeast township, 50 miles north of New York City, and another
twister threw a trailer and a small plane at an airport in the
village of East Moriches on Long Island.
   A 12-year-old girl was killed near Waterbury, Conn., when a tree
fell on her tent at a campground; three other girls inside were
injured, one critically. A man died in New York City when he stepped
into a puddle that was electrified by exposed wires at an excavation
site.
   The thunderstorms also produced hail as large as golf balls and
wind gusts to 70 mph. Two persons were injured in Schoharie County,
N.Y.
   Showers and thunderstorms in the north-central states continued
over parts of the Dakotas, southern Minnesota and northern Iowa
early this morning. In Iowa, winds gusted to 60 mph east of Lake
Park Monday evening and high winds downed trees around Marshalltown.
   Thunderstorms also continued over western Kansas and
south-central Nebraska early today after dropped dime-size hail near
Russell Springs, Kan., Monday evening.
   Showers and a few thundershowers also were over Arizona and New
Mexico. Haze was prevalent in the Ohio Valley and the Middle
Atlantic Coast, and fair skies prevailed across the rest of the
nation.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
northern portions of Airzona and New Mexico across the central
Rockies, the Dakotas, the upper Mississippi Valley, and the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to the central and southern Appalachians.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms were predicted from southeastern
Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast to Florida.
Thunderstorms also were expected in western portions of the southern
Plains, and rain was forecast for northern Maine.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s along the canadian border
from Maine to New York, and from Upper Michigan to northeast
Minnesota; the upper 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast and across
western Washington; and above 100 degrees in the southwestern
deserts and over portions of the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
Elsewhere, highs were forecast to be in the 80s and 90s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 50 degrees at Burns, Ore.,
to 92 degrees at Las Vegas.
