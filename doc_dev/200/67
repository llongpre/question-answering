   Thunderstorms whipped through several Midwestern and Western
states today, bringing fierce rain and wind that ripped down trees,
overturned trailers and soaked areas from eastern New Mexico to

winds downed large tree limbs west of Burlington. Winds roared to
60 mph at Rock, Kan., and dime-size hail fell northeast of Harper.
   In Arizona, winds gusted to 64 mph in Phoenix and hurled a tree
through a house as strong thunderstorm winds overturned trailers at
Black Canyon.
   Rain deluged parts of southern Florida _ more than 2 inches were
recorded in Key West and more than an inch in West Palm Beach.
Wichita, Kan., also received more than an inch of rain.
   Meanwhile, fog blanketed several areas in Georgia, South
Carolina and eastern Tennessee.

Atlantic coast and Florida; numerous thunderstorms from extreme
southeast Kansas into central and eastern Oklahoma; scattered
