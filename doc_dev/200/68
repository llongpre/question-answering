<P>
 -- The Reagan Administration finally agreed to speak with the PLO, which more 
than 90% of Palestinians support as their representative; 
</P>
<P>
 -- The federal judge in Los Angeles declared unconstitutional key provisions 
of the McCarthy-era McCarran-Walter Act being used in the government's attempts 
to deport eight resident aliens who espouse the Palestinian cause; and 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Times printed an article on its Op-Ed Page that is sympathetic with the 
Palestinians' just quest for a homeland and identity (Dec. 28).
