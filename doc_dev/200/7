   A federal judge on Thursday struck down
portions of a 1952 law allowing the government to deport aliens for
espousing anti-American beliefs, saying the provisions violate
immigrants' free-speech rights.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson also threw out an exception
to a 1987 law that recognized free speech rights for all immigrants
in deportation proceedings but members of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Wilson said Congress already has passed a powerful array of laws
dealing with terrorism and his decision would not ``significantly
deplete the government's arsenal in combating terrorism.''
   The ruling came in a two-year-old case involving seven Jordanians
and a Kenyan who were arrested, held without bail and subjected to
deportation proceedings under the McCarran-Walter Act. A federal
immigration judge released them and the government eventually
dropped McCarran-Walter proceedings against all but two, although it
sought deportation of the others on technical grounds.
   A government attorney said Wilson's ruling would be appealed.
   Wilson on struck down sections of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act
providing for deportation of an alien who advocates _ or is
affiliated with a group that espouses _ world communism,
dictatorship or unlawful destruction of property.
   ``The ideological provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act do not
withstand First Amendment analysis,'' he said.
   He said the McCarthy-era statute was ``overbroad'' and could
cause deportation for something as simple as wearing a political
button.
   He cited the landmark 1969 decision in Brandenburg vs. Ohio, in
which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the government can only
prohibit speech directed toward inciting imminent lawless action.
   The judge also ruled that the PLO exception to the 1987 Foreign
Relations Authorization Act violated guarantees of due process and
equal protection under the law.
   ``In this case, the government is trying to stifle certain ideas
from entering our society from certain aliens,'' the judge said.
``Our society, however, was built on the premise that only through
the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper.''
   The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination committee had sued the
Justice Department on behalf of the immigrants, and the battle was
joined by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for
Constitutional Rights, based in New York.
   One of the original defendants, Khader Hamide, 34, called the
decision a victory for Arab and Palestinian immigrants.
   ``We feel as a community now we can speak our minds on the
Palestinian issue,'' Hamide said. ``We can speak our minds on the
uprising on the West Bank and in Gaza and express our opinions
freely without the fear of being put in jail.''
   David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights said the
judge's ruling on the PLO exception to the 1987 law means that
``Congress cannot make politically motivated distinctions in
providing First Amendment rights to aliens.''
   Paul Hoffman, of the ACLU, noting the government's decision to
appeal, said the case would most likely be decided by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``When it is decided, I think it will be one of the handful of
major First Amendent cases that have ever come down in this
country's history,'' he said.
