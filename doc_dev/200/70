   Four big insurers agreed to pay $34 million to settle a
long-running suit alleging that they and other insurance
companies conspired to fix prices of worker's-compensation
coverage in Minnesota.
   The insurers that settled just before trial was scheduled
to begin included Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., Home
Insurance Co., Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and Travelers
Corp.'s Travelers Insurance Co. unit. Nine other defendants
previously placed a total of $16 million in escrow under
earlier pacts, bringing the total settlement package for the
litigation to about $50 million.

   In 1979, Minnesota lawmakers enacted a bill requiring that
the rates employers pay for workers' comp insurance should be
established by the competitive market. Under previous
procedures, a state insurance-industry group known as the
Workers' Compensation Insurance Rating Association of
Minnesota set the rates after receiving prior approval from
the state's insurance commissioner.
   The suit was filed in 1983 on behalf of all Minnesota
employers, alleging that the rating association and some
member companies had continued for four years to operate
under the old rate-setting system.
   For those years, the legislation had established a "base
rate" that the insurance companies thought was too low. While
the federal McCarran-Ferguson Act largely exempts insurance
companies from antitrust prohibitions, the Minnesota
employers' suit claimed the practice constituted a conspiracy
to fix prices and use boycotting tactics, which McCarran
explicitly forbids.
   In 1987, federal Judge James Rosenbaum in Minneapolis
granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of the
insurance companies; that ruling was subsequently overturned
by the federal appeals court in St. Louis.
   Under the latest settlement, which still requires court
approval, none of the defendants admitted to any wrongdoing.
"It was strictly a business decision to settle," said a
spokesman for the insurance group, which has spent in excess
of $10 million defending the case to date. "We think we have
a good case, but the cost to pursue it to completion would
probably not be a prudent decision," given the additional
costs of defending the case through what he said could be
another five or six years.

   NEW CHIEF JUDGE for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.
   Judge Abner Mikva took over as presiding judge when Judge
Patricia Wald, who will remain on the bench, stepped aside
two years before the expiration of her seven-year term as
chief judge. Judge Wald was the first woman to serve as chief
judge of a federal appeals court.
   The D.C. Circuit, as it's called, is one of the most
important courts in the nation below the Supreme Court,
deciding many major federal regulatory disputes. Judges Wald
and Mikva were both appointed by President Carter, but the
court now is dominated, 8-4, by appointees of Presidents
Reagan and Bush.
   The change in presiding judges took place just before
Judge Mikva, a former Chicago congressman, would have become
ineligible to serve as chief judge because of his 65th
birthday, which was yesterday. Chief judges are chosen by
seniority, but no judge may become chief judge after reaching
the age of 65.
   Judges Wald and Mikva have said that tradition was the
reason for the switch and scoff at the suggestion that there
was any other motivation.
   But one side effect is to make it less likely that one of
the court's conservatives, Judge Laurence Silberman, will be
in the line of succession to be chief judge at the end of the
decade.

   MOSCOW CIRCUS goes to court to halt alleged imitator.
   Circus Productions Inc., which has the exclusive North
American rights to promote the group of Soviet circus
performers, accused Columbia Artists Management Inc. of
illegally using a similar name for its own circus act. In a
suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, Circus Productions
asked the court to prohibit Columbia Artists from using the
words Moscow, Soviet, Russia or similar geographic terms in
their promotional material.
   Last fall, Columbia Artists Management prepared a brochure
promoting "Moscow Circus on Stage." Although Columbia said it
later agreed to change the name to "Direct From Russia,
Circus on Stage," Circus Productions wants the promotional
material to carry a prominent disclaimer saying that the acts
aren't related to the 100-year-old Moscow Circus.
   Doreen Costa, an attorney for Columbia Artists Management,
said at a hearing that the company doesn't believe its
promotional material is a trademark infringement. "It isn't a
name," she said. "It's simply a geographic indicator."
   At the hearing, both companies said they would try to
agree on an appropriate disclaimer.

   NOTED: Francis S. Blake, a partner at the Washington law
firm of Swidler &amp; Berlin, was named general counsel of
General Electric Co.'s Industrial and Power Systems business.
GE, Fairfield, Conn., has made a practice of plucking its top
in-house legal staff from the partnerships of major law
firms. However, Donald A. Ross, newly appointed general
counsel of GE's Electrical Distribution &amp; Control business,
rose from within the ranks.
