   The rights of eight immigrants accused
of belonging to a Marxist faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization were not violated during their deportation proceeding,
an appellate panel ruled.
   The four-member Board of Immigration Appeals rejected the
argument that the eight _ seven Jordanians and a Kenyan _ were
subjected to double jeopardy when the government stopped, then
reconvened their deportation hearing last year.
   The board Tuesday said the suspended hearing should resume.
   The eight, who all live in the Los Angeles area, were arrested
in January 1987 and originally charged under the McCarran-Walter
Act with advocating world communism because of their alleged ties
to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They denied
the accusation.
   The government then modified its charges, accusing two of the
eight of subversion and trying to deport the other six on various
immigration violations.
   The immigration judge threw out all the charges May 11, 1987,
when the government refused to produce as a witness a key
immigration official who signed the original arrest warrants.
   The next day, the government refiled the charges with the
signature of a different immigration official.
   Defense attorneys appealed on the grounds that restarting the
hearing was double jeopardy.
   But the immigration appeals board said prosecutors were ``not
attempting to `start over,''' but rather ``corrected'' the
signature on the arrest orders.
   Attorneys for the immigrants said they are considering whether
to appeal the board's decision.
