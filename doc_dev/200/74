   More Indian summer weather dawned today on much of the eastern
and central United States while snow fell in the Rockies.
   Sunny skies and strong southerly winds produced record highs
throughout much of the central United States on Wednesday, with
temperatures into the upper 70s as far north as the Canadian border.
   Afternoon highs of 77 degrees at Alpena, Mich., and 81 degrees
at St. Cloud, Minn., were the warmest on record so late in the
season for those two spots.
   Sunny skies also prevailed in the eastern states where afternoon
highs were mostly in the 70s.
   Wintry weather continued over parts of the West, with snow
spreading across Nevada into Utah, Colorado and Wyoming.
   Advisories for snow and blowing snow were posted for early today
for the mountains and valleys of Colorado and Utah.
   High winds swept the Southwest. On Wednesday, wind gusts reached
63 mph in the Mojave, Calif., 45 mph at Las Vegas and 43 mph at
Kingman, Ariz.
   Showers extended from southern and central California into Utah
and northern Arizona. A few showers and thunderstorms were
scattered across Florida, southern Texas, upper Michigan, New
Mexico and the northern Pacific Coast.
