   Wind, cold and snow moved thorugh the central Rockies today,
producing brisk wind gusts, thunderstorms, hail and snow squalls.
   The cold front moved into Idaho and parts of Utah and Wyoming on
Sunday evening. At Pocatello, Idaho, wind gusted to 41 mph as
visibility dropped to a quarter mile in snow squalls.
   Thunderstorms broke out when the cold front passed through
northern Utah, producing small hail, frequent lightning and
scattered power outages. Wind gusted to 45 mph in the Trenton and
Logan areas. The storm dumped up to a foot of snow in Utah's
mountains, and lesser amounts elsewhere in the state.
   Snow and blowing snow was reported late Sunday across central
and southern Wyoming. Wind gusted to near 40 mph at Rock Springs
and visibility at Laramie dropped to a half mile. Up to a foot of
snow was expected in the southwest mountains of Wyoming.
   Eight to 16 inches of snow was expected in the mountains of
Colorado. High winds should cause blowing and drifting snow and
poor visibility in the state's mountain passes.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms moved through parts of southeast
Virginia and eastern North Carolina on Sunday evening. Nickel-size
hail was reported at Gatesville, N.C., near the Virginia-North
Carolina line.
   Santa Ana winds were expected to develop across Southern
California today. A wind advisory was in effect for the northern
mountains of Southern California. By tonight, winds may gust faster
than 50 mph in some canyon areas of the San Bernardino Valley.
   Clear skies covered most of the nation this morning, but dense
fog advisories were posted for parts of northern and central
Florida and southwest Louisiana.
   Temperatures ahead of the cold front were mild Sunday, with a
72-degree reading at St. George, Utah. The high for the nation
Sunday was 88 at Yuma, Ariz.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 14 at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 71 at Homestead Air Force Base, Fla.
   For today, rain or snow showers were forecast from northern
Arizona and the central Rockies across the northern Plains; and
scattered rainshowers from northwest Kansas to the upper
Mississippi Valley. Skies should be mostly sunny over the eastern
third of the nation, except for a few snowshowers over northern New
England.
   Much of the nation should have highs in the 50s or 60s. Highs
should be in the 30s and 40s from the northern and central Rockies
across the northern half of the Plains and the Great Lakes region
into New England. Temperatures should reach the 70s and low 80s
from Southern California across the desert Southwest, and from the
southern Plains to the southern Atlantic Coast.
