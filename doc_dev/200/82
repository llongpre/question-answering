   Thunderstorms lost much of their punch as they swirled over the
nation today after a stormy rampage that included a tornado,
destructive high winds, large hail and lightning that killed two
men.
   In New Jersey and New Hampshire, two men died Sunday afternoon
after they were struck by lightning, officials said.
   In southeastern Pennsylvania, houses were damaged and the roof
of an apartment building was partially ripped off Sunday by a
tornado in Pottstown.
   Thunderstorms developing along a stationary front curving
through the central High Plains produced severe weather in western
South Dakota. One thunderstorm produced golf-ball-sized hail at
Pine Ridge and another created dime-sized hail and wind gusts to 75
mph near Hot Springs.
   Thunderstorm winds uprooted trees, damaged a roof and blew over
a concert stage Sunday afternoon at Oswego, N.Y. In New Jersey,
harsh winds ripped down power lines in Union and Hudson counties
and downed trees at Middletown.
   Newark, N.J., set a record-high temperature for the date of 100
degrees, breaking the old high of 99 set in 1977. It was the fifth
time Newark topped 100 degrees this year.
   San Francisco marked the hottest day on record Sunday and
residents stripped down, oiled up and took to the beach in droves
to glory in the unprecedented 103-degree weather.
   While there were numerous reports of severe weather in southern
New England and along the middle Atlantic coast Sunday afternoon,
by early today widely scattered showers and thundershowers were all
that remained ahead of the cold front.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms also were reported
over North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.
   Lingering showers and thunderstorms prevailed in southern
Florida and the central Gulf Coast.
   Dense fog blanketed parts of the Champlain Valley of Vermont
early today while clear skies prevailed west of the Rockies.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the central High Plains through the middle Mississippi
valleys, the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the southern
Appalachians, into the central and eastern Gulf Coast and Florida,
and from New Jersey to Massachusetts; numerous thunderstorms in the
lower Mississippi Valley and from southwestern Iowa to western
lower Michigan; and sunny skies over the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast for the 80s or 90s across much
of the nation; in the upper 70s across northern Montana, the
northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley; near 100 from the Rio
Grande Valley into north-central Texas; between 100 and 110 over
the desert Southwest and the California valleys; and 110 to 115
over southwestern Nevada and the southern and northern valleys of
California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at Havre, Mont., to 96 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.
