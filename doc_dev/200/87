   Most of the nation enjoyed clear skies and mild temperatures
this morning after thunderstorms in the Great Plains produced heavy
rain and hail as big as golf balls.
   Skies were mostly clear from New England to most of the Great
Lakes region, the Ohio Valley and the central Plains, and clear
skies prevailed in the Northwest and much of Texas and Arkansas.
   Thunderstorms moved across central Minnesota.
   The storms Wednesday night dropped golf ball-size hail near
Groton, S.D. Hail an inch in diameter covered the ground in Warner,
S.D.
   Scattered thunderstorms Wednesday night extended from southwest
Kansas to the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles and southwest Texas. In
the Oklahoma Panhandle, heavy rain fell for two to three hours,
leaving 4 to 6 inches of standing water on a highway in Texas

   Widely scattered thunderstorms boomed Wednesday night over the
Gulf Coast states and near the south Atlantic Coast. Nearly 4
inches of rain fell at Meridian Naval Air Station, Miss.
   A few strong thunderstorms occurred around midnight in southern
Nevada and southeast California, generating winds gusting to 55 mph
at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nev.
   In Fresno, Calif., it was 106 degrees Wednesday, breaking the
105-degree record for the date set in 1950. The nation's high was
114 degrees in Palm Springs, Calif.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
across Gulf Coast and south Atlantic Coast states; widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms from Arkansas to Texas, western portions
of the central Plains and the southern Rockies to northern and
eastern Arizona; and scattered thunderstorms from the upper
Mississippi Valley to northern Michigan.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s and lower 90s across
most of the nation; the 90s to around 100 degrees in much of
Washington and Oregon; between 100 and 110 degrees in the desert
Southwest and interior valleys of California; the 70s in New
England, from northern Michigan to North Dakota and along the
Pacific Coast.
