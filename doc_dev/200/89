   A storm sent rain and gusty winds across the Northwest today as

   Showers and thunderstorms extended from the northern and central
Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies. The thunderstorms produced

interior sections of northwest Washington.
   Cloudy skies prevailed from the northern Rockies through the
northern and central Plains to the upper Great Lakes and western
sections of the Ohio Valley. Skies were also cloudy over the Florida
Peninsula.
   Today's forecast called for rain in the Northwest, central
California and northeast Florida.

and 40s from the middle and north Atlantic Coast states across most
of the Great Lakes region to Minnesota; 70s along sections of the
Gulf Coast; 70s and 80s over the southern Plains and southern Rockes
