   Rain dampened parts of Seattle and Maine early today, hours
after strong winds and thunderstorms knocked out power to tens of
thousands of people from Ohio to New York.
   A winter storm warning was posted for today in parts of
Michigan, with up to a foot of snow possible over the snow belt of
upper Michigan. Strong, gusty winds with cold temperatures were
expected to bring wind chills down to 15 below zero over northern
lower Michigan and to 20 below zero over upper Michigan.
   A snow squall warning has been posted over extreme northeast
Ohio. Up to 7 inches of snow could fall today east of Cleveland.
   In northeast Ohio Monday night, more than 25,000 people were
without electricity as winds gusting up to 54 mph downed power
lines.
   In metropolitan New York, winds gusting up to 100 mph damaged
four parked airplanes, blasted bricks off buildings and snapped
trees and power lines, leaving thousands without electricity.
   Three Pan American airplanes parked outside a hangar at John F.
Kennedy International Airport were severely damaged by winds
gusting up to 44 mph, said Lt. Kevin Hassett, a spokesman for the
Port Authority police.
   At Newark International Airport in New Jersey, a parked
Continental 727 was picked up off the ground and dropped on a fuel
truck and some baggage carts, injuring a worker inside the craft's
baggage area.
   Elsewhere Monday, thunderstorm winds gusted to 85 mph in central
Pennsylvania at York and State College, bringing down trees and
tearing off roofs. More than 80,000 people lost power throughout
the state.
   ``I heard a terrible rip and I saw the piece of roof come down
past the window,'' said Ellen Morris of York. ``I knew the wind had
taken the roof off. I was hoping I wasn't heading for Oz.''
   In western New York, winds gusted to 81 mph at Jamestown, and up
to 10,000 people in the Buffalo metropolitan area lost power,
officials said.
   Snow fell over northern New England Monday evening, while
showers and thunderstorms extended from central New England across
much of New York state and northeast Pennsylvania.
   Rain also dampened the northern Pacific Coast and the upper
Texas Gulf Coast, while scattered snow fell over parts of Michigan,
northwest Wisconsin and northeast Minnesota.
   Some areas enjoyed unseasonably high temperatures Monday. High
temperature records for the date included 82 degrees at Fort Smith,
Ark., and 75 degrees in San Francisco.
   The high temperature for the nation Monday was 91 degrees at
Northridge, Calif.
