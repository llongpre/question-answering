   Much of the eastern two-thirds of the nation began to cool off
today following a heat wave that toppled temperature records in at
least five states.
   The summer break was most apparent for residents in the
north-central United States, where temperatures early today were
generally in the 50s and upper 40s.
   In the hours after midnight, several record lows already had
fallen for the date, including at Kansas City, Mo., 55 degrees;
Lincoln, Neb., 50; Marquette, Mich., 41; and Ottumwa, Iowa, 52.
   Strong thunderstorms developed Sunday evening in east-central
New Mexico, Texas, northwestern Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   Hail the size of dimes fell near Woodward, Okla., along with
wind gusts to 60 mph. Thunderstorm winds also reached 60 mph north
of Crawford, while winds west of Tulia produced gusts to 70 mph.
   In Memphis, Texas, nearly 2 inches of rain fell in 45 minutes.
   Early today, the thunderstorms and showers extended from New
Mexico into Louisiana, with the strongest storms in Texas.
   Storms brought thunder and rain also to the central high Plains
region early today. Wind gusts reached 58 mph in southeastern
Wyoming late Sunday, and heavy rain resulted in flash flooding
along the North Fork of the Shoshone River west of Cody. A house
and garage were flooded.
   Isolated showers lingered from the Carolinas to New England.
   Fair weather prevailed across the rest of the nation early today
with clear skies over most of the northcentral part of the nation.
   The high for the nation on Sunday was 114 degrees at Bullhead
City, Ariz., and Laughlin, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from the southern Rockies across much of Texas, the Gulf Coast
region and Florida, as well as across much of the Atlantic Coast
region. Sunny skies were expected over most of the rest of the
nation.
   Predicted highs: in the 60s across much of the Great Lakes
region; in the 70s from the northern and central Plains across the
upper and middle Mississippi Valley, much of the Ohio Valley and
central Appalachians into northern New England; into the 90s across
the southern Atlantic Coast states and the Gulf Coast region, and
from the southern half of Texas to much of the Intermountain
region; and above 100 degrees over the Southwestern deserts and
inland valleys of California. The remainder of the nation will
generally have high temperatures in the 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 92 degrees at Phoenix.
