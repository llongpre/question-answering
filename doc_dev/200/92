   Showers and thunderstorms, some record-setting in intensity,
brought more desperately needed relief today to parts of the
central United States choking under a record-setting drought.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell over much of the central Plains,
and rain was widely scattered over much of the High Plains, the
lower and middle Mississippi Valley and along the Atlantic Coast.
   A few of the thunderstorms on Wednesday unleashed high winds and
in southwest Texas spawned a tornado.
   Springfield, Mo., received more than 3{ inches of rain, more
than double the record of 1.51 inches set on the date in 1905.
Nearly 5 inches deluged Wilsey, Kan., 60 miles southwest of Topeka,
and Hill City, S.D., got 2 inches.
   Thunderstorms in eastern Kansas produced wind gusts up to 60
mph, downing several large trees at Pittsburg, gusts to 69 mph
south of Glasgow, Mont., and gusts to 65 mph at Miami, Okla.
   A break from the heat continued in most areas, although the
mercury hit 105 degrees in Jackson, Miss., on Wednesday, surpassing
the June record of 103 set in 1969. Shortly before midnight, the
temperature at Youngstown, Ohio, dipped to 48 degrees to break the
previous record low of 51 for June 29.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
central and lower Missouri Valley through northern and eastern
Oklahoma and into much of the Tennessee Valley and the southern
Atlantic region; showers and a few thunderstorms from the northern
and central Plains through Arkansas into much of the Southeast
states and Florida; and showers scattered across northern parts and
coastal areas of New England.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s across the northern parts
of the Great Lakes into New England; the 50s for extreme northern
New England; the 90s from the southern Rockies through the southern
Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley and the southern Atlantic
Coast into Florida; around 100 in parts of central Mississippi and
the Rio Grande Plains of Texas; and between 100 and 110 from the
valleys of California into the Southwestern deserts.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Burns, Ore., to 89 degrees at Las Vegas, Nev., and
Phoenix, Ariz.
