   Hail the size of golf balls pounded portions of Oklahoma early
today, where high winds and possibly tornadoes earlier inflicted
damage and killed a woman in her mobile home.
   Other storms were scattered along a cold front that extended
Monday night from the upper Great Lakes into the southern Plains.
   Thunderstorms produced hail 2} inches in diameter at Duncan,
Olka., Monday evening as well as near Comanche, Okla. Smaller hail
fell in other parts of the state, while the golf ball-sized hail
fell early today at Ada and near Tahlequah, in eastern Oklahoma.
   Meanwhile Monday night, thunderstorm winds near 60 mph were
clocked near Velma, Olka., and heavy rain drenched much of the
state. Oklahoma City received over 2} inches of rainfall over a
24-hour period.
   The high winds damaged a mobile home in Oklahoma City, killing a
woman inside and seriously injuring her husband. Elsewhere in the
city, about a half-dozen mobile homes where thrown onto their sides.
   In Mustang, Okla., police reported the roofs on City Hall and a
fast food restaurant were damaged by wind. The weather service said
a possible tornado was spotted near Mustang just before 5 p.m., and
other possible tornadoes in Oklahoma were reported at Harrah and
Midwest City.

Missouri and eastern Arkansas. A flash flood watch was issued for

   Showers and a few thunderstorms extended into parts of Illinois
and eastern Wisconsin. Rain was reported across parts of lower
Michigan into western New York state.
   Freezing drizzle was reported in sections of Michigan's Upper
Peninsula early today, while rain was scattered across the Pacific
Northwest and snow was falling over parts of the southern Colorado
Rockies.
   Skies were mostly clear across much of the Southwest on Monday
evening, but high winds continued in sections. Carlsbad, N.M.,
clocked winds to 70 mph late Monday and Phoenix reported winds
gusting to around 40 mph at Deer Valley Airport.
   Some clouds moved into parts of the Southeast late Monday, while
dense fog formed along the Florida Panhandle coast.
