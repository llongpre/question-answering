   A federal appeals court declined Tuessday to
revive left-wing writer Margaret Randall's legal challenge of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's refusal to give her
permanent resident status.
   A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here ruled that Randall, who has fought deportation under the
political beliefs section of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act, must
follow administrative procedures to challenge INS actions in her
case.
   The opinion by Judge Ruth B. Ginsburg upheld last year's
decision by U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn that dismissed
Randall's lawsuit against the INS.
   But the court noted that Congress' decision to suspend
enforcement of the provision during the current fiscal year removes
the danger that Randall will be deported.
   ``It therefore appears that the large question initially raised
_ whether Margaret Randall could regain United States citizenship _
is now reduced to the question _ when she can regain it,'' Ginsburg
wrote in an opinion joined by Judge Laurence Silberman.
   Randall, 51, an American-born writer who lives in Albuquerque,
N.M., renounced her citizenship in the 1960s after she had moved to
Mexico.
   The writer, poet and photographer, who has also lived in Cuba
and Nicaragua, returned to this country in 1984 to marry an
American and teach at the University of New Mexico. She has four
children, including two who are American citizens.
   Randall's lawyers contended that the court had the power to
overturn a 1985 INS decision refusing her permanent resident status
on the ground that her writings espoused world communism.
   Randall said this decision was unconstitutional and therefore,
her eligiblity to reapply for citizenship should be calculated from
that date.
   The panel ruled it would not reach a decision on the case until
that procedure is exhausted.
   ``Once the Board of Immigration Apeals has rendered its
decision, Randall may proceed to the appropriate circuit court _ in
her situation the Fifth or the Tenth Circuit,'' the court said.
   Circuit Judge Abner Mikva filed a dissent, saying ``Randall, I
am convinced, would have obtained the status adjustment she seeks
but for a governmental official's unconstitutional action.''
