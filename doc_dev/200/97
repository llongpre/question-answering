   A band of thunderstorms developing ahead of a cold front began
to fizzle today as it meandered through the Rockies and the South,
bringing scattered showers. Clear skies prevailed over most of the
nation.
   Thunderstorms produced severe weather Friday afternoon across
parts of Texas, Louisiana and South Carolina, but weakened during
the evening hours.
   The storm system hitting the northern Rockies produced wind
gusts to 60 mph at Conrad Airport in northwestern Montana on Friday
evening, but those thunderstorms also dissipated.
   Early this morning, showers and thunderstorms were scattered
across eastern Texas, southern Arkansas and western Louisiana.
Showers and thunderstorms also dotted the coast of the Carolinas
and Georgia.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms continued along the cold front
crossing Idaho and western Montana, while scattered showers
prevailed in the Pacific Northwest. Showers also were reported in
New Jersey and southeastern New York.
   Elsewhere, clear skies prevailed early today.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms along the
Gulf Coast from southeast Texas into northern and central Florida;
numerous thunderstorms across southeast Texas and southern
Louisiana; showers and a few thunderstorms across the Pacific
Northwest; and mostly cloudy skies across southern New England.
Elsewhere, mostly sunny skies were expected.
   Temperatures were forecast to be in the 80s or 90s across much
of the nation; in the 70s from the Great Lakes region through the
lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys into Arkansas and the Carolinas;
in the 60s from the central Appalachians and upper Ohio Valley into
New England; in the 60s and 70s from the Pacific Northwest into the
northern half of California; and 100 to 110 in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 37 at
Greenville, Maine, to 90 at Phoenix, Ariz.
