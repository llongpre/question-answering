<HEAD>Court Upholds Bar on Exclusion of Ohio Palestinian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday upheld a
preliminary injunction that bars the government from excluding a
Palestinian man from the United States.
   Ruling in the case of Fouad Rafeedie of Cleveland, the appeals
court said that U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Green must decide
whether immigration procedures the U.S. government is using against
Rafeedie violate his right to due process under the Constitution.
   In its 2-1 ruling, the appeals panel said immigration officials
may proceed against Rafeedie under another provision of federal
law, which allows him to be represented by legal counsel, to
present evidence and to challenge witnesses in an open
administrative hearing.
   Rafeedie, a permanent resident alien who has lived outside
Cleveland for 13 years, traveled to Syria in 1986, attending the
meeting of an organization affiliated with the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist group, immigration
officials say.
   Rafeedie, who denies he was affiliated with the group, was
questioned by the FBI on his return and in 1987 was charged with
being excludable from the United States under immigration laws.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service then attempted to
expel him under the summary exclusion provision of the
McCarran-Walter Act.
   Under that provision, the INS gave Rafeedie no indication of the
nature of confidential information on which it sought to exclude
him and Rafeedie isn't entitled to a hearing.
   Rafeedie's lawyer, David Cole of the Center for Constitutional
Rights, said he is confident the U.S. District Court will find that
the procedure violates due process.
