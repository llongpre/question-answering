blown down in Camden and Currituck counties and lightning downed
several trees at Lumberton.
   In Fitchburg, Mass., high winds ripped through the center of
town, felling trees, power lines and two church steeples and
killing at least one person Friday. Sandra R. Cressey, 53, of
Fitchburg was in her car when it was crushed by a wooden steeple
that fell from the First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church, said
Vicky Greene, a nursing supervisor at Burbank Hospital.
   Parts of Nebraska were among the hardest hit by storms in the
