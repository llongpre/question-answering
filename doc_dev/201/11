   Mickey Mouse may be getting ready to step out with Miss Piggy. 

   Walt Disney Co. is negotiating to acquire closely held Henson Associates Inc., the New York-based company that controls rights to the Muppets and a host of other characters, according to individuals close to the talks. 

   A value for the transaction wasn't available, and Disney and Henson declined to comment. 
It couldn't be determined whether there were any other suitors for the Henson concern. 

   The merger would be an obvious fit, say entertainment-industry watchers, because Disney is always looking to expand its character base: Its characters can cavort in a multitude of businesses. 
In addition to making filmed entertainment and operating theme parks, Disney has a consumer-products division that distributes merchandising rights and operates a chain of retail stores that sell dolls, toys and T-shirts. 

   The Muppets have appeared in several motion pictures and a myriad of television shows for network and cable; Disney produces television shows and owns a pay cable service, The Disney Channel. 
And Disney's theme parks always have room for characters. 

   "They're really buying the licensing rights to the characters," says analyst Alan Kassan of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
"The main thing would be the consumer products and merchandising, but there's always the possibility they could have something like a Muppet playground at a theme park." 

   One individual familiar with the talks says the economies of scale make sense in this era of consolidation in the entertainment business. 
Henson now has to pay syndication salesmen to distribute its shows; after joining Disney it could simply use the entertainment giant's existing network. 
"You can save overhead," the individual says. 

   To clear up a possible misconception: This deal wouldn't affect Big Bird, who is owned by Children's Television Workshop, a nonprofit corporation. 
Jim Henson helped create the characters on its television show "Sesame Street," but only one of those Muppets, Kermit the Frog, is a wholly owned Henson character. 
Henson Associates apparently owns a percentage of the rights to the Sesame Street characters, but a spokesperson for CTW says the details of the copyright are "proprietary." 
Mr. Henson still serves as a Sesame Street collaborator -- providing the puppeteers, and even playing the characters of Kermit and Ernie himself. 

   "Disney needs new characters because there's always a risk with Disney of overexposing the characters they do have," says one analyst, adding that the Roger Rabbit characters aren't enough to supply fresh characters to projects like the new Euro Disneyland under construction near Paris. 

   Henson Associates controls a growing library including several feature films and hours of "The Muppet Show," "Fraggle Rock" and other TV shows. 
Most are syndicated and widely seen overseas. 
CBS's cartoon hit "Muppet Babies" is produced with a partner. 
And more is coming: a feature film, "The Witches," tentatively set for October release by Warner Brothers, an HBO series and an NBC mini-series. 

   A question Disney will have to grapple with, say observers, is to what extent they integrate Henson's well-known characters with their own. 
One insider says the danger of confusing people is minimal, that Disney has taken outside characters before and made them their own. 
"Is Winnie the Pooh -- or Peter Pan," the person says, "really a Disney character?"
