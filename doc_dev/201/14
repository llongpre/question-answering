   Miss Piggy, glamorously attired in swimwear
and a broad-brimmed hat, is lounging around the hotel pool soaking
up the sun and the attention.
   The sun, high in the cloudless sky, is hot and Miss Piggy
retreats to a cabana. The hotel, like a pink fantasy surrounded by
palm trees, is reflected in the sparkling blue pool.
   Behind her, the crew rigs up a sun screen for her scenes by the
pool. Her makeup woman and wardrobe mistress await her summons.
   She pulls down her sunglasses, peers over them at a reporter and
says breathlessly, ``Please, no interviews.''
   Jim Henson, however, is willing to talk. After all, the NBC
series Miss Piggy is working on is called ``The Jim Henson Hour.''
   More than 30 years ago, Henson created ``The Muppets,'' which
has grown to include Miss Piggy, Henson's green alter ego Kermit
the Frog, Big Bird and Cookie Monster on ``Sesame Street'' and a
wide assortment of mostly lovable but sometimes gruesome creatures.
   ``The Jim Henson Hour'' is a magazine-style show that mixes
half-hour ``The Storyteller'' dramatic pieces, ``Miss Piggy's
Hollywood'' and Muppet creatures in various pieces, some of which
are enhanced by computer graphics.
   ``We had been doing `The Storyteller' and were working on a
high-tech version of a variety show and some specials when the idea
struck us of putting it all together,'' said Henson. ``We presented
it to NBC and they said OK. What it is, is two half-hour shows back
to back, but about every fourth episode we'll do an hour show.''
   One piece, called ``The Song of the Cloud Forest,'' is about an
endangered species of tree toad. The design is in the style of
South American primitive art with bright, intense colors. The
Muppet creatures are filmed against a blue ultimatte screen and the
animation-like background is generated electronically by a system
called Paintbox.
   ``Basically, everything we do involves creatures of some kind,''
said Henson. ``One show is called `Living With Dinosaurs,' which
was written by Anthony Minghella, who writes `The Storyteller.'
It's a contemporary story about a boy with a toy dinosaur that
comes to life. It's live action, but the dinosaur is a Muppet. My
son, Brian, manipulates the dinosaur. He also does the dog in `The
Storyteller.'
   ``We produce all of the shows. I have a whole separate unit in
England. They do `The Storyteller' and they're doing two of the
hour shows. They also made the creatures for `Lighthouse Island,' a
half-hour live-action show about an island with some very strange
people.''
   Henson said he wanted to do things that have never been done on
television before. ``I think we've always pushed puppetry to the
limits and now we're pushing new technologies to the limit,'' he
said. ``We're using the most sophisticated state-of-the-art
technology available. It's very exciting to mix puppets and
technology.''
   The Muppets made their first network appearance on ``The Jimmy
Dean Show'' in the early 1960s. Rowlf the talking dog carried on
frequent conversations with Dean. The first wide exposure of
various Muppet characters came on ``Sesame Street,'' whose 20th
anniversary was celebrated on ``The Jim Henson Hour'' in early May.
   ``The Muppet Show'' from 1976 to '81 ran in more than 100
countries and was seen by more than 235 million people. Kermit,
Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal and all the other creatures became
as famous as real celebrities. The show won three Emmys, a Peabody
and numerous other awards and honors. ``The Muppet Babies'' is an
animated Saturday morning series on CBS that has won four Emmys in
a row as best children's program and is also seen in 50 countries.
   Henson's creations inspired a series of movies, beginning with
``The Muppet Movie'' in 1979. ``The Witches,'' based on a Raold
Dahl children's story about a little boy who's turned into a mouse,
is due out later this year. His creature shop in London made the
characters for ``Dream Child'' and ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja
Turtles.''
   His production of ``Fraggle Rock,'' which ran for five years on
Home Box Office, will begin running in the Soviet Union in October.
   ``Puppetry is very advanced and very popular in Russia,'' Henson
said. ``Soviet television has a puppet pig called Krushe on every
afternoon.''
   Another series, ``Jim Henson's The Ghost of Faffner Hall,'' will
make its debut on HBO in the fall. It will feature a new set of
Muppets, including Fughetta Faffner, a ghost with a love of music
who haunts the Gothic mansion she built in the last century.
