   The death of Jim Henson left a chasm on Sesame
Street and beyond. It also left questions about who would do the
voices of Kermit the Frog and other beloved Muppet characters.
   Henson, 53, died Wednesday of multi-organ failure brought on by
complications from galloping pneumonia, said Dr. David M. Gelmont,
who treated Henson at New York Hospital.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Monday at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine, said Susan Berry, a spokeswoman for Jim Henson
Productions.
   It was unclear what affect Henson's death would have on the
program, which is produced by the Children's Television Workshop.
   After Mel Blanc died on July 10, 1989, his son, Noel, took over
the voices of Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny and other Warner Bros.
characters.
   Henson and with his wife, Jane, had five children who range from
age 19 to 30.
   Lisa Simon, who produces Sesame Street, said it wasn't
immediately known what would become of the voices of Kermit; Ernie,
the smiling humanoid devoted to his rubber duckie; and Guy Smiley,
``America's favorite game show host.''
   Henson always did those voices and had no substitute.
   It also wasn't known whether Henson's death _ or any new voices
for the characters _ would be explained to the children who watch
the show.
   ``We're just dealing with shock of Jim's death,'' said Simon.
   In 1982, Will Lee, the actor who played the kindly shopkeeper
Mr. Hooper, died at age 74. The next season, young viewers were
told about Mr. Hooper's death.
   Viewers got the news on the Thanksgiving program, chosen because
parents were likely to be with their children then to answer
questions.
   In a four-minute segment, players on the program explained the
death to Big Bird, who bought birdseed milkshakes from Mr. Hooper's
store.
   ``Just because,'' he was told.
   Another human character, David, said he had taken over the store
and would be providing Big Bird's beverages.
   At the end of the segment, Big Bird hung a drawing of Mr. Hooper
over his nest _ and viewers were told that a baby had been born to
a human couple on the program.
   ``That's the amazing thing about babies,'' said Big Bird. ``One
minute they're not here, the next minute they are.''
   ``Sesame Street'' reaches 11 million American households and is
broadcast in 80 countries. It has been estimated that about half of
all American children between ages 3 and 5 watch the show.
   The show is shot from September through January, and the 22nd
season begins airing next January.
   ``That gives us the opportunity to catch our breath and see
where we're going to go from here,'' said Simon. ``There are a lot
of characters on the show other than Jim's characters.''
   A Walt Disney Co. spokesman said despite Henson's death, Ponce
D. Lion and other Muppets will still get a series on the Disney
Television Channel, and a 3-D Muppet movie will be produced as
planned.
   Under an agreement signed last summer, the company purchased
rights to use Muppet characters in its theme parks, movies, TV
shows and retail products.
