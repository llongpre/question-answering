   Jim Henson's admirers gave him the whimsical,
colorful send-off he wanted, complete with songs, dance and, of
course, the Muppets.
   ``We had such great silly fun together,'' said Frank Oz, who
played Bert to Henson's Ernie, and Miss Piggy to his Kermit the
Frog. ``The best thing is when you watched Jim laugh until he
cried.''
   Thousands took part in the tribute to the master puppeteer
Monday at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Henson died
Wednesday of pneumonia at 53.
   The happy songs, happy words and a Dixieland band were in
accordance with wishes Henson expressed in letters to his family,
written four years ago and opened after his death. Henson had asked
that mourners not wear black.
   The funeral service program contained a quote from Henson:
``Please watch out for each other and love and forgive everybody.
It's a good life, enjoy it.'
   An organist opened with a mournful rendition of the theme from
``Sesame Street,'' which used the Muppets to entertain and educate
children worldwide.
   Then a band strolled in playing ``Please Release Me,'' followed
by ministers, a red-and-white robed church choir and family members.
   ``There is no question about Jim Henson's great artistry and the
extent to which we have all been touched by it,'' Harry Belafonte
said. ``Greater than his artistry was his humanity.''
   Mourners fluttered colorful butterflies atop metal stems as
Belafonte and three back-up singers sang ``Turn the World Around,''
a song he wrote and Henson used.
   The mourners again fluttered their butterflies while listening
to a recording of Henson as Kermit singing ``Rainbow Connection''
from ``The Muppet Movie.''
   Big Bird, a character played by Caroll Spinney, sang, ``It's Not
Easy Being Green,'' a number usually done by Kermit. Afterward, Big
Bird looked heavenward, said, ``Thank you, Kermit,'' then slowly
walked away, head hung low.
   The 5,000-seat cathedral was nearly full and lined with colorful
floral arrangements, some with animal figures in them. At the
entrance was a gallery of photos with Henson, his family and
``Sesame Street'' characters.
   ``He's stayed with us long enough to give us certainly all we
need, if we're strong enough to carry on,'' said Henson's widow,
Jane, who stood with their five children to address the
congregation.
   Her advice to the mourners was, ``Enjoy life to the fullest. He
always did, but always with a little pain, a little sorrow that
gave it richness.''
   Henson's son Brian read excerpts from his father's letters.
   ``Don't feel bad that I'm gone,'' Henson wrote to his children.
``It will be an interesting time for me. ... I look forward to
seeing all of you when you come over.''
