   Walt Disney Co. filed a counterclaim against Henson
Associates Inc. and agreed not to open a new theme-park
attraction in Florida until at least May 24, allowing time
for a federal judge in New York to rule on a
copyright-infringement lawsuit filed against Disney by
Henson.
   Henson, in turn, won't seek an injunction to block the
opening of "Kermit the Frog Presents Muppetvision 3-D" at
Walt Disney World. Instead, U.S. District Court Judge Pierre
Leval will hear arguments from both sides beginning May 13,
then rule on the merits.

   Disney also filed a counterclaim yesterday, denying the
allegations, seeking its own unspecified damages and giving
some hints of its defense. Disney argues that it had an oral
contract and an implied license to use the Muppet characters.
   Disney began planning to build the attraction after it
said it intended to acquire Henson in 1989. But terms
couldn't be reached, relations deteriorated, acquisition
talks fell apart last December, and, finally, negotiations
over the licensing of the Muppet characters at Walt Disney
World broke down last week. Henson filed the lawsuit the next
day saying Disney didn't have permission to use the Muppets.
   The language in Disney's counterclaim is only slightly
less withering than that in Henson's lawsuit. Henson didn't
file its suit "to protect the `beloved Muppets' or {founder}
Jim Henson's `legacy', but, rather, because the heirs of Jim
Henson wanted different terms and more money for their
father's company than Disney and their father ever
contemplated."
   After Mr. Henson died in May 1990, Disney says, Henson
asked for an increase in price to account for estate taxes.
Henson has denied this. Disney accuses Henson of dragging its
feet in negotiations because it was "positioning itself for
litigation" last fall. Disney also said it spent $90 million
for the Muppetvision attraction and other Muppet-related
matters. It asks for the return of $2 million it says it
already paid Henson for work performed on the attraction.
   The Disney counterclaim also accuses Henson of circulating
its news release announcing the suit last week to securities
analysts as well as reporters, and says Henson contacted
Disney as early as 1984 about the possibility of Disney
acquiring Henson.
   A Henson spokesman said of Disney's basic argument, "Why
would Disney negotiate for months over a license if it
already had one?"
