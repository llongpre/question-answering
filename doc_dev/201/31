WALT DISNEY has filed a counter-claim against Henson Associates, a
family-run company founded by the late Jim Henson, denying allegations that
it knowingly violated copyrights and trademarks of the Muppets puppet
characters and seeking unspecified damages, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
Henson Associates filed its copyright-infringement suit to prevent Disney
from using the Muppets without a licence on April 17. A trial on the merits
of the suit will begin on May 13.
Disney has agreed not to open 'Kermit the Frog Presents Muppetvision 3-D'
before May 24.
Disney had conditionally agreed to acquire the Henson film library and the
right to some of Henson's most popular characters in 1989, in a deal valued
at about Dollars 150m. However the relationship between Disney and Henson
started to disintegrate after Mr Jim Henson's death last year.
