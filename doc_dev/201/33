   Will Disneyland's Abe Lincoln be deposed
by Kermit the Frog and the Muppet gang?
   ``Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln,'' which features a robot
replica of the 16th U.S. president, will close at least temporarily
Aug. 26, Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said Friday.
   Roth would not comment on employee reports that a 3-D movie
featuring the late Jim Henson's Muppet characters will replace
Lincoln. But he did say no reopening date for the 25-year-old
Lincoln attraction had been set.
   ``It's a refurbishing of that whole facility,'' said Roth.
``We'll be announcing our plans.''
   The Lincoln attraction is housed in the Disneyland Opera House,
which also holds exhibits on the park and its founder, Walt Disney.
   Disney himself developed the ``audio-animatronic'' Lincoln,
which premiered at the 1964 New York World's Fair and moved to
Disneyland in 1965. Lincoln stands up from a chair, gestures and
recites excerpts from his speeches.
   Disney ``was extremely proud of creating that figure,'' Roth
said. The Lincoln attraction underwent a $200,000 renovation about
five years ago.
   According to park employees who spoke on condition of anonymity,
the Muppet movie is replacing Lincoln as part of Disneyland's
effort to give a higher profile to Henson's characters.
   Disney officials announced earlier this year that a Muppet stage
show and parade were planned for the park in 1991, while a 3-D
``Muppetvision'' movie and theater was set for 1993.
   Disney last year purchased rights to use the Muppet characters
in its theme parks, movies, teleivison shops and retail products.
   Asked about the chance the Muppet image could swamp the older
Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Roth noted that when
changes have been made in the past _ such as teaming with filmmaker
George Lucas to create ``Star Tours'' and ``Captain Eo'' _ there
was criticism.
   ``Every time you do something like that there will be people who
are unhappy, saying that's not how Walt Disney would have done
it,'' he said.
