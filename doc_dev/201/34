   Sammy Davis Jr., the exuberant
song-and-dance man who started as a goggle-eyed child vaudevillian
and battled to the glittery top of the entertainment world, died
Wednesday of throat cancer at age 64.
   Davis performed on stage, on television and in the movies as an
actor, singer, dancer and impressionist _ a powerhouse packed into
a bantam, 5-foot-6 frame.
   His hit songs included ``Something's Gotta Give'' (1955), ``I've
Gotta Be Me'' (1969) and ``The Candy Man'' (1972). His films
included ``Porgy and Bess,'' ``Oceans 11'' ``Robin and the Seven
Hoods'' and ``Sweet Charity.''
   Davis began as a tap-dancing toddler in Harlem.
   His energetic performances and upbeat manner were therapy for a
life scarred by bigotry, failed marriages, drug and alcohol abuse
and crippling tax problems.
   His last movie was 1989's ``Tap,'' in which he co-starred with
Gregory Hines as an old-time hoofer.

   Jim Henson, who gave his voice to Kermit the
Frog and his creative spirit to a multitude of Muppets, died
Wednesday of pneumonia at age 53.
   Henson created the Muppets in 1954. They made their debut on a
Washington TV program and appeared regularly on ``The Ed Sullivan
Show.'' But their popularity exploded after they began appearing on
``Sesame Street'' in 1969.
   Millions of children in 80 countries grew up watching Kermit,
Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, Bert and Ernie
cavorting on the show, which teaches basic English and math to
preschoolers.
   Later, Henson's ``The Muppet Show'' won three Emmys during its
five-year run and became the most widely seen TV program in the
world.
   Henson's puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with ``The
Muppet Movie,'' followed by ``The Great Muppet Caper'' and ``The
Muppets Take Manhattan.''
   He also won another Emmy for ``The Jim Henson Hour,'' a special
on NBC.
   Henson also won a Peabody for excellence in TV programming and a
Grammy for a Muppet album. His Saturday morning cartoon, ``The
Muppet Babies,'' won four consecutive Emmys for outstanding
animated program.
