   A Purdue University professor says
it ain't easy being Kermit. But when you're the namesake of a
famous frog, life isn't all bad.
   Kermit Scott was the grade-school friend of Muppets creator Jim
Henson, who died Wednesday in New York of complications from
bacterial pneumonia at age 53.
   Scott had not heard from his friend since he was 14. That's when
the Henson family left Leland, Miss., where the two grew up
together. But Scott learned from a newspaper article years ago that
the most famous of the Muppets was named for him.
   ``I guess I made an impression on him,'' said Scott.
   ``We had gone our ways, and I have very fond memories of our
time toegether,'' Scott said Wednesday.
   Named Theodore Kermit Scott Jr., he grew up being called Kermit
because his father used the name Theodore.
   ``It was a bit of a burden. No one else was ever named that,''
he said, but added, ``Now it's a name everybody knows.''
   Scott, a philosophy professor, says he often uses Muppets in his
lectures.
   The Kermit character, he said, has ``that kind of ability to
remain open to all of the possibilities, while at the same time
dealing with all the hassles.''
   He said he always has been flattered Henson used his name for
the puppet known for singing, ``It ain't easy being green.''
   ``I certainly felt there are a lot worse things my name could be
associated with. I'm very happy and proud of what he
accomplished,'' Scott said.
