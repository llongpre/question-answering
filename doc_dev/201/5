Catapulted to fame by "Sesame Street," Muppet creator Jim Henson, who died 
Wednesday at age 53 in New York of a massive bacterial infection, left behind a 
dynasty of remarkable foam-and-wire creations -- Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, 
Miss Piggy and Big Bird among them -- that live on with a beguiling independent 
reality of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant vanity of Miss Piggy ("Moi?"), the endearing greed of Cookie 
Monster, the shy sweetness of Big Bird and Kermit's bemused voice of reason are 
familiar to audiences worldwide through television, films, records, books, 
toys, computer software, clothing and other Muppet merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
More significant than the marketing bonanza it became, was the fact that the 
special world of the Muppets offered a haven to children growing up in an 
increasingly troubled era, a haven where reading and numbers were fun, a haven 
without peer pressure or violence or drug dealers. Parents encouraged their 
children to walk down "Sesame Street" or soar with "Pigs in Space," secure in 
the knowledge that no harm would befall them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the characters will survive, the sorrow is that their future will lack 
the guiding hand of their gentle creator. 
</P>
<P>
Henson's genius flowered in his original exploitation of television as a visual 
medium. Earlier television shows with human and puppet characters, such as 
"Kukla, Fran and Ollie," were set up like little theater performances, with a 
human host and puppeteers behind a curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Henson created interaction between humans and Muppets -- his term for a cross 
between puppets and marionettes -- with complex, three-dimensional settings and 
crew members concealed in trenches or behind walls. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of seeing a human simply talking to a puppet, viewers were offered a 
new dimension, one where Muppets were firmly in control and human visitors had 
to cope with the eccentric surroundings as best they could. 
</P>
<P>
Muppets could appear above, below, behind or in front of their human guests. 
The effects wouldn't have worked for a live audience -- the scaffolding would 
have been visible and the cameras would have gotten in the way -- but the 
results were spectacular to home viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Without their endearing, humorous, all-too-human characteristics, however, the 
Muppets would have been just another technological surprise, to be exclaimed 
over and then dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Henson gave them more than technical life; he gave them soul. Sweet, petty, 
crusty, jealous, greedy, grumpy, wise and funny, each possessed an 
individuality with which their human counterparts could identify. 
</P>
<P>
And identify they did. Henson's Muppets became a merchandising and media 
phenomena, second only to Disney characters in their instant visual identity. 
Last year, Kermit and Mickey Mouse became a mega-team, when Henson's production 
company and the rights to his Muppet characters were purchased by the Walt 
Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
Henson's stunning artistic and commercial success were light years away from 
his high school puppet club days and a career that began in the '50s with "Sam 
and Friends," a local puppet show on a television station in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
That show, the first major outing for Kermit the Frog, won an Emmy in 1958. 
Quirky guest appearances on "The Ed Sullivan Show," "The Tonight Show" and "The 
Jimmy Dean Show" followed. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1969, came "Sesame Street," and Henson's Muppet dynasty proliferated 
with instantly appealing blue and green monsters, shaggy dogs and round-headed, 
goggly-eyed creations, helping millions of children learn letters, numbers and 
social skills. 
</P>
<P>
The first generation of "Sesame Street" viewers are now watching Oscar the 
Grouch and Bert and Ernie with their own toddlers. (This is the second major 
creative loss for "Sesame Street." Joe Raposo, its remarkable composer and 
musical director, died last year.) 
</P>
<P>
But Henson wanted to reach a wider audience, and "The Muppet Show," a 
star-studded variety program, premiered in London in 1976, before moving to the 
United States. Feature-length movies came later, and still more television 
series -- "Fraggle Rock"; "The Jim Henson Hour," an innovative mix of live 
action, computer graphics and puppetry; the Saturday morning cartoon "Muppet 
Babies"; and the HBO music appreciation series, "The Ghost of Faffner Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Not all brought commercial success -- the movies "Labyrinth" and "The Dark 
Crystal" didn't do well -- but Henson's fantastic creations continued to earn 
wide-eyed raves. 
</P>
<P>
Kermit the Frog, the reasonable mediator, frequently perplexed by an 
unreasonable world, was often referred to as the soft-spoken Henson's alter-ego 
(he was one of Henson's earliest creations and Henson supplied his voice). 
Henson, who preferred staying out of the limelight, denied that his 
award-winning creations spoke for him. In a 1984 Times interview, he said, 
"They don't do or say things I wouldn't otherwise do or say. I don't see myself 
as a repressed person hiding behind the characters." 
</P>
<P>
Yet during that interview, Henson only became voluble when he spoke as Kermit. 
To a little green frog, the spotlight was a warm and wonderful place to be.
