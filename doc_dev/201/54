   Next Monday, Big Bird, Ernie, Oscar the Grouch
and others will start their 22nd season wandering along that public
television path that kids of all ages know as ``Sesame Street.''
   There'll be a few changes. Two teen-agers are joining the cast.
So is a Claymation creature, Cecille Ball. Oscar's mother will come
to visit. Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams each will be in two
``Sesame'' shows.
   And the new ``Street'' season will concern race relations. It
will try to show pre-schoolers that it's the heart and mind, not
skin color, that matters - even though, as Kermit the Frog so
eloquently sang it once, it's not easy being green.
   Next Monday also will be a special occasion for Joan Gantz
Cooney. It'll be her first season as the ex-chairman of the show's
producer, Children's Television Workshop. She turned the reins over
last month to David Britt, a veteran CTW executive who has been
with the production company for 18 years.
   But she's staying with CTW, and especially with ``Street,'' she
says, because ``I want to work entirely on the creative side and
the strategic planning side.''
   Her renewed involvement with ``Sesame Street'' is due ``in some
degree'' to the death last May of Muppet-master Jim Henson, who
created a number of characters for the show, including Kermit.
   Although the series has an extensive tape library of Henson's
characters, ``I want to make sure that the relationship with the
Muppeteers continues very strong, and that we create, maybe, new
characters,'' she says. ``I'm interested in seeing that the show
stays very contemporary.''
   It is that, having gone from four to five basic educational
goals its first year to a teach-while-entertaining ``curriculum''
for pre-schoolers that Cooney estimates has covered 200 topics.
   They include sibling rivalry, pre-science, death, adoption and,
of course, love.
   Last season, the series, which is seen in 80 countries and still
is aimed at children 2 to 5 years old, began segments set in a home
day-care center for tykes.
   That was done and remains in the series ``because it's something
our audience can identify with,'' says ``Street'' executive
producer Dulcy Singer. Increasing numbers of kids wind up in
day-care centers or after-school programs because their parents,
whether divorced or still married, must work to make ends meet.
   ``Children are much more in day care and after-school programs
now,'' says Cooney, who because of that has two projects afoot,
neither intended for TV.
   One is to develop after-school ``packages'' using CTW's other
educational shows, ``Square One'' and ``3-2-1 Contact,'' ``to tutor
kids in math and science, kids staying after school because their
parents work,'' she says.
   The other is a planned pilot program in which ``Sesame Street''
materials and books would be used for children's activities in
Dallas day-care centers.
   Also afoot for next season, but on PBS, is an as-yet untitled
literacy series to teach reading and writing skills to children 7
to 12 years old, she says.
   As with the major networks, cable, independent stations and
videocassette players have bitten into PBS' audience, and ``Sesame
Street'' has been among the shows affected. But not so much in the
morning, Cooney says.
   The real ratings drop of ``Street'' is due mainly to cable's
Nickelodeon channel aimed at viewers 2 to 15, she says. It occurs
in the afternoon when older children come home from school and
commandeer the TV set.
   At such times, she says, ``the little kid that might want to
watch `Sesame Street' is overpowered by his or her older sibling.''
   Pondering ways to deal with this and other problems will be part
of her work now with the company she co-founded.
   ``It's like having a 22-year-old child,'' she said of her new
role at CTW. ``The child may not need you full time. But when the
child needs you, you're there for it.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   ``CHEERS,'' ``MURPHY BROWN'' GET THE ONCE-OVER: NBC tonight is
airing a one-hour retrospective of its top-rated ``Cheers.'' The
hour will be moderated by John McLaughlin, the keep-it-quick
discussion show host whose ``The McLaughlin Group'' series is a
fine example of how Washington journalists can be taught to
harrumph oudly, and on cue.
   Also tonight, Diane Sawyer is taking viewers of ABC's
``PrimeTime Live'' behind the scenes of CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' the
noted CBS comedy series about a network news magazine series. It is
not known if ``Murphy Brown'' later will go behind the scenes of
``PrimeTime Live,'' which is not a comedy series.
