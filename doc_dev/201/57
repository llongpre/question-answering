   Over the ages, storytellers have bridged
generational and geographical boundaries by retelling folk tales,
usually invoking some magic of their own to highlight their talents
and suit the audience.
   Continuing the tradition in the TV age is Jim Henson, creator of
``Fraggle Rock,'' ``The Muppet Show'' and Kermit the Frog and Big
Bird on ``Sesame Street.''
   Borrowing a monster here, blending in a few fairy tales there,
Henson has been delighting even the crustiest of curmudgeons with
``The Storyteller,'' a series of half-hour specials on NBC. The
fourth installment, ``The Luck Child,'' airs Saturday.
   For ``The Luck Child,'' Henson has borrowed a griffin from the
brothers Grimm and blended elements of some early Russian folk
tales. The show's magic is seamless thanks to the witty script by
British playwright Anthony Minghella, and, of course, the Muppet
mutations.
   The 14-foot-tall talking griffin (a thinking man's Big Bird _ it
claims to be misunderstood) is one of the biggest bunches of wood,
wire and widgets ever created in the London-based Muppet ``creature
shop.'' With some high tech and human help, the people-eating,
havoc-wreaking beast is brought to life by Henson's 24-year-old
son, Brian.
   ``Performing the griffin on a small platform inside its neck,
throwing my body out at different angles was sort of like being in
an aerobics class,'' said Brian Henson.
   On a smaller scale, he also ``performs'' the storyteller's
talking dog with an assistant, a tiny TV monitor, a computer and 13
thimble-size motors controlling the dog's facial movements. He says
the dog, a stylized blend of breeds, ``has a hard edge, intended to
play against the lecturing style of the narrator,'' played by
British actor John Hurt in the title role.
   ``The Luck Child'' borrows elements from ``The Lucky Child'' and
``Marco the Rich and Vasily the Luckless'' in a collection by
Alexander Afanasev. A Russian ethnographer and lawyer, he published
more than 600 native folk tales in the mid-1800s, becoming the
Russian counterpart to the brothers Grimm of Germany.
   ``The Luck Child'' also contains elements of Grimm's ``The
Griffin'' and ``The Devil with Three Golden Hairs.'' A peasant
child is born and, according to a prophecy, he will one day rule
the land, whose current leader tries to do away with him. But the
luck child survives, after tricking the griffin.
   The sponsors hope viewers will look for more stories like ``The
Luck Child'' in books. One of the show's sponsors, Clorox, also is
a sponsor of the national, non-profit literacy organization,
Reading Is Fundamental, which has distributed 78 million books to
children since 1966. It's a rare event: a prime-time network
sponsor hoping you'll read more books!
   One such book could be ``Folk Tales of the Amur'' (Abrams),
which includes 31 stories from the Russian far east. Another is
Afanasev's collection, ``Russian Fairy Tales'' (Random House).
   The Afanasev book is a standard, according to Alex Alexander,
head of the Slavic Department at Hunter College in New York and an
expert on Russian folklore. It includes Russian versions of
universal fairy-tale figures as well as the Firebird, the witch
Baba Yaga and Ivan the Terrible.
   Ironically, Russian tales like these apparently first appeared
in written form, not in their homeland in their native tongue, but
in England in the 1600s after being brought out and translated by
foreign travelers. This was mainly because Russian written
literature was almost entirely based on church teachings and folk
tales were passed by word of mouth.
   The tradition of borrowing and retelling to suit different
nations and storytellers continued when authors such as Gogol,
Dostoevski and Tolstoy, incorporated folklore into their works.
   For example, although Pushkin knew Russian folk tales and
recorded them, he wrote story poems based for the most part on
French translations of the Arabian Nights, Grimm or Washington
Irving. Pushkin's ``Tale of the Golden Cockerel'' is simply a
retelling of Irving's ``Legend of the Arabian Astrologer.'' Yet
Russian and American readers think it's Russian folklore.
