CELEBRITY DEATHS: DAVIS, HENSON AND JILL IRELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

It's hard to believe that the "Candy Man" and the "Muppet Man" are no longer 
with us.

So much talent. So much creativity. So much energy. So much love of life. Sammy 
Davis Jr. and Jim Henson will indeed be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy and Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog are as much American institutions as 
baseball and cherry pie. Sammy's broad smile and dynamic style and Kermit's 
soft-spoken charm have made a lasting impression on me.
