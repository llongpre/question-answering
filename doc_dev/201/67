   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. announced
Wednesday it has acquired rights to ``The Muppet Show'' from Jim
Henson Productions.
   The four-year agreement gives TBS exclusive U.S. telecast rights
to the Emmy Award-winning series, which consists of 120 half-hour
episodes conceived and produced by Muppet creator Jim Henson.
   ``The Muppet Show'' enjoyed consistently successful ratings
between 1976 and 1981, and was one of the most popular first-run
syndicated series. It received three Emmys and the George Foster
Peabody Award for excellence in programming.
   TBS Entertainment Networks President Gerry Hogan said the
program is scheduled to premiere in October on Turner Network
Television, the company's new cable entertainment network, and will
also be made available to SuperStation TBS.
   Turner Broadcasting and Jim Henson Productions also plan to
collaborate on new television projects, the announcement said.
   Henson said he is looking forward to working with TBS Chairman
Ted Turner because ``Ted has some great ideas for family
programming.''
