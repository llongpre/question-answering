   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on Sammy Davis Jr. and Jim Henson:
   They were among the most familiar entertainers of their time _
the high-spirited song-and-dance man whose smile was as bright as
his copious gold jewelry; the gentle puppeteer with long hair and a
bushy beard who turned a felt frog into a soft-voiced friend,
philosopher and secret romantic. The deaths of Sammy Davis Jr. and
Jim Henson take something away from all of us, but especially from
children.
   Davis, who succumbed to throat cancer in Los Angeles at age 64,
symbolized the triumph of talent and tenacity over racism.
   Henson, the creator of Kermit the Frog, the Cookie Monster, and
dozens of other Muppet characters, died suddenly in New York
Hospital at age 53.
   Davis' recordings have long been classics; Henson's films and
cartoons are staples of practically any video store. The ebullience
and sparkle these men brought us in life is gone, but their
creative gifts will long endure to entertain us and our children.

   The Press-Enterprise, Riverside County, Calif., on video games
and reality:
   Nintendo, the Japanese computer gamester, has announced it will
donate $3 million over five years to the pioneering Media
Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The idea is to
help children learn while they're having fun. Certainly these two
parties are equipped to do that. But the sight of them shaking
hands produces a vague sense of uneasiness. ...
   Commercially, Nintendo's instincts have been impeccable. Their
game machines now are in one of five American homes. But charges of
monopolistic practices swirl around Nintendo. American rival Atari
has filed an antitrust suit and the Justice Department has been
asked to investigate it.
   Much of this stems from Nintendo's practice of tying its
software designers up with exclusive contracts that prevent them
from adapting successful games to anyone else's hardware systems.
   To these charges Nintendo's president Hiroshi Yamauchi replies:
``If our terms are so strict they make people unhappy, they're
always free not to accept them.'' Yes, they are: Free to walk away
from an association with the outfit which controls 80 percent of
the market.
   But then these decisions always cost something. As do the
decisions on what proprietary interest Nintendo may claim in any
research breakthroughs this union with MIT may produce.
   Perhaps it's that aspect of things, that pitting of ethics
versus instinct, that gives rise to the sense of uneasiness. One
side seems to have a head start.

   Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette on college athletics:
   There are too many incidents of recruiting violations, players
who spend little time in classes and just plain bad behavior in
college athletics. A better system than the one now in place is
obviously needed to control such abuses.
   Two attempts at imposing controls surfaced in recent days. One
is a good idea. The other isn't. If the good idea is not acted on,
the bad idea may be imposed.
   The good idea was embodied in a Washington meeting that brought
together men and women coaches and college presidents. Basketball
topics ranged from shoe contracts to graduation rates to tenure to
recruiting violations.
   Notre Dame's Digger Phelps suggested that a sport czar replace
the National Collegiate Athletic Association as rulemaker and
disciplinarian.
   Indiana's Bobby Knight touched on tenure. ``When a coach loses
his job and we know he's a good coach, we know he's an honest guy,
we wonder, `What do I have to do to keep my job?''' Knight said.
   Knight also said that a school's athletic scholarships ought to
be based on its graduation rate.
   Louisiana State's Dale Brown and North Carolina's Dean Smith
pointed to potential problems with the contracts coaches sign with
manufacturers of athletic shoes.
   The good idea is that coaches and university presidents see the
need for new action to rid college athletics of abuses.
   The bad idea was on display in Springfield, Ill., where a bill
was introduced in the state legislature to make the NCAA's list of
recruiting violations part of the criminal code. That's a poor idea
for two reasons:
   _ First, such a proposal would add another complex duty to law
enforcement's list of chores. Abuses in college athletics are
serious, but not nearly as serious as other problems police and
prosecutors are asked to solve.
   _ Second, while the Illinois proposal may die in the
legislature, it is a sign that people are unhappy with athletics in
state-supported schools. In effect, introduction of the proposal
says that if schools don't police themselves, others will take on
the job.
   Those in college athletics _ presidents and coaches in
particular _ must do more of what they were doing in Washington. If
they don't, they will eventually see what was proposed in
Springfield enacted into law.
