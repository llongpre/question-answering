   Kermit the Frog may lament it ain't easy bein'
green, but now he can boast it's easy to be seen on Soviet
television.
   Just call him comrade, because Muppets creator Jim Henson and
his London-based company Henson International Television announced
Thursday ``The Muppet Show'' and ``Fraggle Rock'' will be on Soviet
TV come fall.
   The governing body of Soviet television, Gostelradio, agreed to
allow the shows. The agreement follows the airing in the Soviet
Union of a ``Fraggle Rock'' episode which ``drew unprecedented
rating figures,'' according to a company statement.
   It said 3,500 viewers wrote letters to the network after the
show, and Soviet entrepreneurs have already applied to Henson for
merchandising rights.
   ``I am very pleased that at last our programs and characters
will be seen in the Soviet Union,'' Henson said. ``I've always
worked with an international audience in mind and having our
programs seen in Russia is personally gratifying.''
   ``The Muppet Show'' alone has been seen in more than 100
countries by upward of 235 million people.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
astronomer Carl Sagan says the United States and the Soviet Union
should join forces and head for Mars.
   The show of cooperation between the two superpowers could revive
a space exploration program that has been dormant for 10 years,
Sagan told more than 400 scientists and aerospace specialists
gathered Wednesday for a symposium.
   Sagan joked that the joint mission might trigger a dispute over
who would get to set foot first on Mars. ``I have one solution,''
Sagan said. ``We tie together the ankles of the Soviet and U.S.
(astronauts). Or perhaps a better solution, posed by the Europeans:
Let them be first.''
   Sagan told reporters after his speech that he thinks heading to
Mars is a better next step for space exploration than establishing
a presence on the moon.
   ``The moon worries me,'' Sagan said. ``The moon is dull. We've
been to the moon; it is unchanging ... People are fundamentally
bored with it.
   ``Mars, on the other hand, is a dynamic world. It has weather;
it has climatic change ... It is something that will occupy our
exploratory sense for a great period of time.''

   A scholarship named in honor of singer
Willie Nelson now exists at the University of Texas at Austin.
   The university system's board of regents on Thursday accepted
the Willie Nelson Endowed Presidential Scholarship in the College
of Fine Arts. It was established with a gift of $35,000 from Joseph
D. Jamail, a prominent Houston attorney, and Darrell Royal, former
Texas football coach and men's athletics director. Royal serves as
special assistant to the president on athletics programs at the
Austin campus.
   Income from the endowment will be used for one or more awards
annually to school band members in good academic standing.
   Band Director Glenn Richter said the band plans to make a
recording with Nelson, an Austin resident and golfing buddy of
Royal's.

   Greta Garbo, describing herself as a ``sour
little creature,'' says: ``If somebody gave me a million dollars I
wouldn't write anything about myself. I wouldn't do it for anything
under the sun.
   ``I don't think it's worthwhile. I don't think it's very
interesting.''
   Comments made over the last 26 years by the reclusive film star,
who hasn't made a movie since 1941, were recorded by a friend and
published in a spring issue of Life magazine.
   ``I don't want any kind of attention from anybody, except that I
know that someone likes me, and that's nice. Otherwise, it's
sickening,'' she said.
   The 84-year-old Garbo, who has an apartment in Manhattan, says
she suffers from inertia. ``But to run from place to place is not
what I'm looking for,'' she said. ``I can't take it. ... You have
to show passports, and someone might say, `Oh, that's the one who
used to be in the movies.'''
   She said she's always wanted two lives: ``one for the movies,
one for myself.''

   If Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Tommy
Lasorda wins his battle against linguine, the Salvation Army will
gain $5,000 for a youth center. But he admits the habit is hard to
break.
   ``Every time I've tried to lose weight, I look at that linguine
and say, `Who's stronger _ you or me?''' Lasorda said.
   Lasorda, 61, weighed in at 202 pounds Wednesday at the Salvation
Army, four pounds shy of the 20 he is trying to lose.
   Covington restaurant owner Jeff Ruby has pledged $5,000 if
Lasorda meets his goal before the All-Star Game on July 11. He said
he will double his contribution if Lasorda keeps off the weight by
season's end.
   Lasorda, in Cincinnati for a Dodgers-Reds series, insisted he'll
have no problem reaching his goal. ``I'll be there next week,'' he
said.
   Lasorda's appetite is legendary in baseball circles, but he
started losing weight in early March when pitcher Orel Hershiser
and leftfielder Kirk Gibson challenged him to shed 20 pounds.
   Ruby, who ran away from home when he was 15 and never returned,
added his challenge after reading a newspaper article about the
need for a youth center in Covington.
