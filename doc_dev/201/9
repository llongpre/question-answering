   Walt Disney Co. said it acquired Henson Associates Inc., owner of the Muppet characters. 
Terms weren't disclosed, but sources placed the transaction, which had been expected, at $150 million to $200 million. 

   Disney thus gathers up a whole host of new characters to use in its various businesses all over the world. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Disney closed at $116.75, up 25 cents. 

   Disney management has vastly increased the value of its regular characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, but needs to expand the company's character base and guard against any of these characters going out of fashion or being overexposed. 
Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and the rest of the Muppets are known by children all over the world because their TV shows have been widely syndicated. 
And Disney, more than perhaps any company, will know what to do with them. 
"I don't know if it's a marriage made in heaven," says analyst Lee S. Isgur of PaineWebber Inc., "but both sides are going to benefit." 

   Henson founder Jim Henson couldn't be reached to comment, but sources said it was he who started the process, contacting Disney's chairman, Michael Eisner, with the idea four months ago. 
Mr. Henson had deflected approaches from other companies in the past, including Disney rival MCA Inc., which tried again to get back into the bidding recently, but too late. 
Mr. Henson wanted to free himself from administrative pressures, and was eager to gain access to Disney's technological know-how in computer animation and theme park engineering. 
Most of all, say those close to Mr. Henson, the transaction was an opportunity for him to ensure that his characters would live forever. 

   The Henson film library includes five feature films, a total of nearly 300 episodes of three television series, "The Muppets," "Fraggle Rock," and "Muppet Babies," as well as a hodgepodge of other programs. 
"And they're all evergreen -- you're dealing with material that does not age," says Walt Disney Studios President Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
Disney needs programming to feed its cable service, the Disney Channel, and would take over the world-wide syndication of the properties as soon as existing agreements expire. 

   Another Henson asset is merchandising potential. 
Disney's consumer-products division operates more than 100 retail stores and licenses rights for products like diapers and toys. 
Mr. Katzenberg said music and publishing were areas Disney would further explore with the Muppets. 

   Disney won't own Henson's production company, but will have exclusive rights for its work: Disney says Mr. Henson will create motion pictures and television for the three U.S. networks, for syndication and for the Disney Channel, as well as made-for-home-video. 

   Mr. Henson also can create new characters, Mr. Katzenberg says. 
Mr. Henson will retain the royalty he collects from the Sesame Street characters he helped create but that are owned by the nonprofit Children's Television Workshop. 
In other words, Disney has no claim on Big Bird. 

   The Muppet characters also will populate Disney's theme parks. 
Work has already started on a Muppet-based attraction to open in May at Disney/MGM Studios at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., which is seeking more activities for young children.
