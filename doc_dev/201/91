   The Flintstones and the Jetsons are headed
for the big screen and Yogi Bear will endorse a string of
``Jellystone Park'' campgrounds as Hanna-Barbera Productions tries
to diversify.
   David Kirschner, new president of the company that created
wise-cracking, mischief-making Yogi Bear and the stone-age
Flintstones, said he dreams of building a family entertainment
empire based on the classic cartoon characters.
   On Wednesday, he announced plans for full-length films,
television productions, theme park attractions and campgrounds _
all designed to revive Hanna-Barbera.
   ``Our goal is to show the industry that we are a player,'' said
Kirschner, who created the animated film ``An American Tail.''
   After the 32-year-old company peaked in the 1970s, it stood on
the sidelines while Walt Disney Co. and Muppet creator Jim Henson
reaped the financial fruits of cartoon diversification.
   One of the Hanna-Barbera's first projects will be a half-hour,
prime-time television version of ``An Animated Tail,'' to be
produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment with
Hanna-Barbera animators.
   The adaptation of the 1986 film that has grossed $165 million
will come to television after ``An American Tail II'' is released
in theaters during the 1991 Christmas season, Kirschner said.
   Also in the works are ``The Flintstones,'' a full-length film to
be released in fall 1991, ``Jetsons: The Movie!'' slated for
release next summer and a string of Yogi Bear Jellystone Park
Camp-Resorts.
   Kirschner, who joined Hanna-Barbera last month, said he
envisions the kind of diversification that turned around
once-stagnant Walt Disney Co.
   The diversification would include T-shirts and other retail
sales items emblazoned with the image of Fred Flintstone and many
of his old friends from the cartoon shows that brought
Hanna-Barbera early success.
