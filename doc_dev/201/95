   The horde of squealing youngsters knew how to
get to Sesame Street on Thursday: Follow the yellow bird, just as
millions of kids have done watching television for the last two
decades.
   The Smithsonian Institution saluted the 20th anniversary of the
popular public television show with lavish oratory at the ceremonial
opening of a ``Sesame Street'' exhibition at the Smithsonian's
National Museum of American History.
   Visiting preschoolers swarmed past grown-up dignitaries and TV
cameramen to jostle happily around Mr. Hooper's storefront.
   At the window ledge was Elmo, their old Muppet friend. The
friendly, red-faced animal, operated by puppeteer Kevin Clash, waved
back and spoke to the youngsters who reached out to grasp his paws.
   The children giggled at Oscar the Grouch, scowling from his trash
can, and peered up at the 8-foot-2-inch yellow majesty of Big Bird.
Along the lower walls of the museum, they twirled clear plastic
wheels to form funny faces and searched a train picture to count the
hidden letter T's.
   ``The one thing kids won't learn on `Sesame Street' is the
difference between education and fun,'' said Ellen Roney Hughes, the
exhibition curator.
   ``Sesame Street,'' created by Joan Ganz Cooney's non-profit
Children's Television Workshop to help disadvantaged children age 3
to 5 make the transition from home to school, made its public
television debut Nov. 10, 1969.
   In the last two decades, the hour-long show has won 36 Emmys and
is seen regularly in more than 11 million households each week. The
English-language version is seen in more than 80 countries.
   Producer David V.B. Britt estimated the show has 40 million
``graduates,'' not counting tens of millions of parents who also
watch.
   Britt was accompanied by Loretta Long, the actress who has played
Susan the nurse on ``Sesame Street'' since it began. Long is a
professional educator with a Ph.D. in urban education.
   Museum director Roger G. Kennedy said the show's creators had
prevailed against ``the greed, heedlessness and irresponsibility of
much of network television'' to produce a program that has ``made an
immense difference in the tone of our culture.''
   ``It is not only a TV program, it's a proclamation that there are
people, even in the TV industry, who aren't going to give up on it,
they're staying with it and producing something that is good,''
Kennedy said. ``That's heroism.''
   The exhibition includes more than 50 photographs recalling two
decades of ``Sesame Street'' programming.
   Besides the show's familiar Muppet characters, objects on display
include the Sesame Street lamp post and sign, original story boards
and a production slate used in filming.
   When the exhibition closes at summer's end, Oscar will join the
museum's permanent history of American entertainment collection,
alongside Judy Garland's ruby slippers from ``The Wizard of Oz,''
Larry Hagman's cowboy hat from TV's ``Dallas'' and Archie Bunker's
wing chair from ``All In The Family.''
   For the record, Big Bird likes birdseed sandwiches, while Oscar's
favorite treat is an ice cream sundae topped with pickles and
sardines.
