   For millions of French television viewers, the
nightly news begins when Kermitterrand the Frog discusses the day's
events over aperitifs with a long-haired pig in pearls and an
anxious eagle called Black Jack.
   This is the Babete Show (Dumb Animals Show), five minutes of
Gallic wit and sarcasm broadcast nightly on the private TF1 station
before the 8 p.m. news and featuring France's favorite political
puppets.
   The takeoff on Sesame Street's Muppets is not intended for
children only.
   The undisputed star of the show is Kermitterrand, a wide-mouthed
bright green frog, who combines the face of President Francois
Mitterrand with the body of the Muppets' Kermit. He also is known as
God.
   The show has become a must for some 36 percent of the television
audience _ 7.2 million homes _ making it France's most-watched show.
Taxi drivers and doctors tune in, but no one follows it as closely
as politicians.
   A single episode can touch on a half-dozen news items ranging
from the firing of Daniel Barenboim as artistic director of the new
Opera-Bastille to an insider trading scandal.
   ``We take the news, then twist and torture it,'' Jean Amadou, a
well-known satirist and one of the show's creators, said in an
interview.
   ``By having the puppets talk in down-to-earth, everyday language
we show that the coded, esoteric talk of politicians is worn out.''
   Mitterrand, who is a Socialist, reportedly is amused by
Kermitterrand's ranting and raving and has aides record his antics
when he can't watch them himself. The president has also been known
to regale intimates with imitations of Kermitterrand, and references
to the show have crept into his speeches.
   The anxious eagle, Black Jack, is a play on former Premier
Jacques Chirac. The long-haired pig in pearls (Miss Piggie in the
Muppets) is supposed to be Georges Marchais, the French Communist
leader.
   Their colorful cohorts include Rocroa the crow (Premier Michel
Rocard, also a Socialist); Barzy, the kind, cuddly bear (former
Premier Raymond Barre), and a curly haired goat (Culture Minister
Jack Lang).
   ``Please excuse this question which might seem idiotic, Oh Great
Monarch of Triumph, but weren't you supposed to be in Bulgaria
today, bah-bah,'' Lang-the-goat asked Kermitterrand in a recent
episode.
   ``Of course I'm in Bulgaria, puerile lamb,'' Kermitterrand snaps.
``What's the point of being God, if you can't be in two different
places at the same time, eh?''
   Another memorable segment found humor in the release of the last
three French hostages from Lebanon a few days before the first round
of presidential elections last May.
   Charles Pasqua, interior minister in Chirac's conservative
government then in office, took the credit. Chirac was criticized on
grounds he was trying to manipulate voters.
   ``How did you get them to release the hostages?'' one incredulous
puppet asked a long-tusked walrus (Pasqua).
   ``Simple,'' the walrus replied. ``I promised to give them back on
Monday.'' Amadou said he never dreamed the show would be so
successful.
   Kermitterrand has graced magazine covers, Babete watches are the
latest chic souvenir and co-creator Jean Roucas, who appears on the
screen with the puppets, is stopped frequently for autographs.
   ``People realize more and more that politicians are conniving
wheeler-dealers, on the left and the right, and we say so on the
show,'' said Roucas, 36, who does the voices for all the puppets.
   ``The political press in France is at the service of politicians.
We're saying things the way they are.''
   The Bebete Show _ its title plays on the twin meanings of the
word ``bete,'' stupid and animal _ is written the same day it's
broadcast, taking final form in midafternoon. By the time they meet,
Amadou and Roucas have already combed the newspapers and the jokes
fly.
   France recently has been following the news of an insider trading
scandal that touched friends and associates of Mitterrand and forced
the resignation of a high-ranking Finance Ministry official.
   On the final show before a break _ it will return in late
February _ Kermitterrand appeared as a machine-gun toting
Kermitterambo.
   Furious because he could neither stop his political enemies from
fueling the insider scandal nor prevent Amadou and Roucas from
writing it into their script, Kermitterambo gunned them all down.
   Alone at last, he quickly reassured viewers.
   ``Don't worry, on Feb. 27, God will bring them all back to life.''
