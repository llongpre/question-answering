   It was 200 years ago that French citizens overthrew
King Louis XVI, beginning a bloody revolution that was to
reverberate throughout Europe.
   Bastille Day, July 14, the day in 1789 when the French
revolutionaries stormed and destroyed the state prison in Paris is
the national holiday of France.
   A reconstruction of the Bastille and ``the world's biggest ball''
are just two of the events marking the celebration of the
bicentennial of the French Revolution taking place in France in the
coming months.
   Those thirsty for ``revolutionary'' wine will find it at the
Salon des Vins at the Porte de Versailles where, from April 28 to
May 8, visitors can sample wine made as it was during the reign of
Louis XVI.
   For visitors who don't speak French but would like to know more
about exactly what happened 200 years ago, a special historical bus
tour in English is being offered by Vision tourist agency. The tours
go both to Versailles, where the Royals lived it, and to sites in
Paris, where they died.
   Meanwhile, the Tuileries Gardens from May 5 to Nov. 11 will
become a living theater of bicentennial events.
   A special area in the gardens will come alive with musicians,
dancers and clowns, while cafes and a restaurant cater to hungry and
thirsty crowds.
   In a theater space visitors will see computer-powered plastic
automatons resembling Robespierre, Danton and other historical
figures doing their revolutionary thing, though beheadings are not
part of the show.
   And spectators may experience a time warp as they view the
computerized 3-D film of Paris as it was 200 years ago, complete
with a riot outside a bakery, the crowds demonstrating against
high-priced bread.
   The gardens will sprout several temporary structures, including
two 120-foot towers with spiral staircases to evoke flying doves,
the bicentennial symbol.
   Another theater will offer nonstop, 10-minute skits with actors
portraying aspects of the Revolution like ``Fraternity Night.'' This
is not a celebration of pledging a college frat, but a show on ``the
abolition of privileges.''
   Those in Normandy at mid-summer will be able to see Tall Ships
from all over the world sailing from Rouen to Le Havre between July
12-15.
   As a special salute to France, 51 visiting brass bands from the
United States will parade from City Hall to the Trocadero on July 8.
   Also in July will be the inauguration of a giant arch west of
central Paris, a new monument that stands in a line of landmarks
beginning at the Place de la Concorde and running through the Arc de
Triomphe. The inauguration will kick off events to celebrate the
Declaration of the Rights of Man, the French Bill of Rights adopted
during the Revolution and later the preamble to the French
Constitution.
   Festivities will peak on Bastille Day, July 14, beginning with
fireworks and including ``the world's biggest ball,'' a huge street
dance on the evening of July 13.
   At the Place de la Bastille, the new Paris Opera will open its
doors for the first time, offering a concert commemorating the
revolution.
   The original Bastille prison was burned down two centuries ago,
but visitors can see copies of it reconstructed at La Villette, a
giant park in northeast Paris from July 9-15.
   At the end of the show, visitors will be allowed to tear down the
towers and take home souvenir bricks inscribed, ``Liberte, Egalite,
Fraternite.''
   Meanwhile, toy-makers are offering giant inflatable plastic
replicas of the Bastille _ suitable for the backyard.
   In a more serious vein, President Francois Mitterrand will host a
summit meeting of the seven richest nations schedueled to take place
at the height of the summer celebrations.
   On July 14, U.S. President George Bush, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and other heads of state are expected to view the
parade and flyover from the presidential box on the Champs-Elysees.
   As a gala wind-up on July 15, a special sound-and-light display
created for Paris by Jean-Paul Goud will illuminate the City of
Lights.
   The Eiffel Tower, celebrating its own centennial, will present a
special illuminated show on July 17. And Mayor Jacques Chirac has
announced that on Aug. 26 tightrope walker Philippe Petit will
negotiate the Seine on a 400-foot highwire between the Eiffel Tower
and the Palais de Chaillot.
   Petit will carry a copy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man
to present to Chirac.
