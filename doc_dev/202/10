   France is readying a display of sparkle, power,
culture and whimsy for this week's climax of the French Revolution
bicentennial.
   The focus will be on an assembly of nearly 30 world leaders, on
spectacular parades and fireworks, and on the inauguration of a new
Opera house at the Place de la Bastille, where a mob stormed the
hated Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, to launch the revolution.
   Among the chiefs of state on hand will be President Bush, for the
annual economic summit of the world's seven largest industrial
democracies. By chance, this year is France's turn to be host.
   The result, depending on the point of view, is expected to be the
City of Light at its most enchanting _ or a security-imposed
gridlock on a scale the developed world has never seen.
   It will either be a fitting tribute to one of the founding events
of the modern age, or an exercise in self-congratulation that
ignores both the cruel and brutal side of the Revolution and the
plight of today's poor and oppressed.
   Bicentennial celebrations and commemorations have been in full
swing all year, but the big weekend gets started Thursday, when
President Francois Mitterrand has all his out-of-town guests _ Bush
and the other leaders of the rich countries, but also the leaders of
Bangladesh, Mali, India and Egypt and other countries _ over for
lunch.
   Later on, when the economic summit gets moving, the leaders of
the poor and middle-income countries wind up relegated to a
second-class itinerary _ dinner with Premier Michel Rocard, and the
like _ which reportedly has even Mitterrand's Socialist supporters
uneasy.
   A ``counterbicentennial'' demonstration and concert last weekend,
on the theme that the commemoration should have more to do with the
Third World and less with solemn ceremonies and fancy dinners, drew
an estimated 100,000 people to the Place de la Bastille.
   Apparently Mitterrand's original plan was to mount an encounter
between leaders representing all continents, and rich and poor
countries, but he was unable to win support for the idea from his
summit partners.
   With all the dignitaries dashing about town, Paris will see its
most stringent security ever, including a dirigible looking down
from above, and what are expected to be epochal traffic jams.
   Police say expressways and city streets will be shut without
warning when motorcades of the 30 leaders are about to pass. A chunk
of central Paris is already a no-parking zone and will be off-limits
to ordinary vehicles for three days.
   Thursday night, Bush and the other leaders get a taste of culture
at the inaugural performance in the high-tech Opera house that
Mitterrand has ordered built at the Bastille, just across a busy
square from where the prison once stood.
   The new building, at the gate of the newly upgraded eastern
section of the city, is supposed to bring opera to the people, but
news of its construction has been overshadowed by controversy over
its program.
   Conductor Daniel Barenboim was fired in January over what the
government said were his elitist views and high salary. It took
until May to get a new musical director, and regular performances
will not start until next year.
   Friday is Bastille Day, featuring two severely contrasting
parades on the Champs-Elysees. The traditional military display,
with missiles, tanks, helicopters and fighter planes, makes its
deafening way down the avenue in the morning.
   Later that night, a much-anticipated spectacle choreographed by
the bad boy of French advertising, Jean-Paul Goude, portraying the
ideals of the revolution through twists on national stereotypes.
   ``They are cliches, but I'm trying to be positive with the
cliches,'' Goude said Monday.
   The images range from Britons parading in artificial rain, to
Russians dancing with a bear on ice, to Africans on live zebras to
the Florida A&amp;M University marching band strutting backward all the
way down the avenue.
   ``It's Michael Jackson's Moonwalk,'' Goude said. ``I asked them
if they could do the `Moonwalk' from the Etoile to Concorde and they
said, `No problem.' Very American. They're doing a salute to James
Brown.''
   The summit itself, with chief items on the agenda expected to be
the debt crisis and global environmental action, begins Friday under
the new pyramid entrance to the Louvre museum, which is closed for
three days to give way to the leaders of France, Britain, Italy,
Canada, Japan, West Germany and the United States.
   Most of the meetings, however, will be in the just-finished
cube-shaped arch in the La Defense complex on the capital's western
edge.
   If everyone is not exhausted by Saturday night, they are invited
to watch the city's annual fireworks display near the Eiffel Tower,
wrapping up the bicentennial celebrations with some of the flash and
spark that started it all in July 1789.
