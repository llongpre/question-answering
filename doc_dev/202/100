Chancellor Helmut Kohl has invited three leading Germans with links to the
resistance against Hitler to come with him to Paris today to attend France's
Bastille Day celebrations - German soldiers will join the parade for the
first time since the second world war as members of the Eurocorps. Mr
Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist was a junior officer involved in the July 20, 1944
conspiracy to assassinate Hitler. His father was executed for his part in
the resistance. Mr Klaus von Dohnanyi, former lord mayor of Hamburg, and Mr
Manfred Rommel, lord mayor of Stuttgart, will also attend. Mr von Dohnanyi's
father was murdered in Flossenburg concentration camp, while Mr Rommel's
father, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, was forced to commit suicide for links
to the July 20 plotters.
