On a day when leaders of seven industrialized nations formally opened their 
economic summit here, mounted Republican Guards in silver helmets pranced down 
the Champs Elysees below jet fighters trailing the national colors today in a 
show of precision, pomp and might honoring Bastille Day and the 200th 
anniversary of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250 planes and helicopters streaked overhead in the daytime military 
display, to be followed hours later on the flag-bedecked avenue by a nocturnal 
fantasy of elephants, dancing bears and marching bands.

Martial Music

Columns of more than 5,000 men and women, from frogmen to Foreign Legionnaires, 
300 armored vehicles, unarmed mobile missiles and sophisticated transmission 
equipment paraded to martial music this morning.

The Interior Ministry said up to 1 million people lined the city's most 
celebrated avenue for the spectacle.

President Francois Mitterrand reviewed the troops at the Place de l'Etoile and 
then, standing in a light reconnaissance vehicle, rode down the avenue to the 
Place de la Concorde. There he joined President Bush and other world leaders in 
the presidential tribune, at the site where the guillotine stood during the 
revolution.

Later, the ceremonial start of the summit, the 15th such meeting, was held in 
the spectacular but controversial Louvre Pyramid, the new, giant glass 
structure designed by American architect I. M. Pei that serves as an entrance 
to the national museum of France.

At a later working dinner at the Hotel de la Marine, White House Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu said, "The focus will probably be on the political issues" that 
are expected to be a major topic during the talks that conclude Sunday.
