   Heads of state streamed into Paris Wednesday, many
hoping to lobby for debt relief from the world's richest nations
during opulent celebrations marking 200 years since the French
Revolution.
   By Friday, 32 leaders were expected for the economic summit,
including government heads from the seven largest industrialized
democracies and 25 more from five continents.
   Also Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presented
France with a monumental oil painting to hang in the hall of the
Opera Bastille, which was designed by a Canadian architect for the
bicentennial.
   On the eve of the three-day blockbuster celebrations, Mulroney
told French Premier Michel Rocard that ``Point de Rencontre,'' a
huge abstract in glowing primary colors by Canadian painter
Jean-Paul Riopelle, ``celebrates the richness of art and the
creativity and friendship between Canada and France.''
   The gleaming glass-and-steel building designed by Canada's Carlos
Ott overlooks the Place de la Bastille _ the historic site where the
Revolution began 200 years ago when revolutionaries stormed the
infamous prison.
   Pointing to the spectacular panorama of the Paris skyscape _ with
breathtaking views of the Eiffel Tower and the twin spires of Notre
Dame _ Mulroney called Ott's design ``a gigantic sculpture of light
and harmonious curves.''
   Also on hand for the presentation were French Culture Minister
Jack Lang and Pierre Berge, president of the Opera Bastille.
   Berge said he was confident the Opera Bastille's inaugural
concert Thursday, starring some of the biggest names in Opera,
including Teresa Berganza and Placido Domingo, would go off without
a hitch.
   The annual summit meeting of the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada coincides this year with
the French bicentennial.
   The world leaders will attend the opening of the new Opera at the
Bastille, watch two parades and a fireworks show, and gather for
lunches and dinners as Mitterrand's guests.
   Teams of cleaning personnel worked frantically to ready the giant
construction for its unveiling by French President Francois
Mitterrand before a glittering roster of invited guests.
   On Friday, Parisians _ and millions of television viewers
worldwide _ can watch Jean-Paul Goude's funny and funky
opera-ballet-parade called ``La Marseilleise,'' which stars 10,000
international dancers and musicians, elephants, zebras and a dancing
bear.
   Festivities also include 36,000 all-night outdoor balls, a
traditional military parade down the Champs-Elysees on Friday
morning, culminating in a spectacular display of fireworks on
Saturday night.
   The new Opera Bastille will close on July 20 for six months in
preparation for its first bona fide operatic production in February
under the musical direction of South Korean conductor Myung
Whun-Chung.
