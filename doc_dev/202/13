   A parade of moonwalking U.S. college students,
ponies painted to look like zebras, and a Russian bear on skates
lent fantasy to Saturday's celebration of the 200th anniversary of
the French Revolution.
   It also offered a somber reminder of the price of liberty.
   In a late change of program after last month's repression in
Beijing, hundreds of Chinese students walked bicycles around a giant
red drum. They wore headbands bearing the Chinese characters for
``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,'' the watchwords of the French
Revolution.
   The 250 musicians of the Florida A&amp;M band, gliding backwards in a
Michael Jackson moonwalk down the Champs-Elysees before a crowd
estimated at 1 million, offered a tribute to American soul star
James Brown.
   They shared the famous avenue with Scottish pipers marching in
artificial rain, Soviet guards walking in fake snow, a huge steam
locomotive, and other creations of the imagination of French
advertising maverick Jean-Paul Goude.
   The $15 million extravaganza of fantasy and symbolism was called
the ``The Marseillaise,'' a parade described by Goude as a
``slightly frivolous opera-ballet.''
   Besides the lively crowds in the street, about 30 presidents and
prime ministers gathered on a balcony overlooking the Place de la
Concorde. They were in Paris to attend the festivities and
participate in an annual summit conference of industrial nations,
which began Friday.
   Television audiences in France and much of Europe also watched
the parade, which began late Friday and extended into early Saturday.
   French television showed British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
peering through binoculars at the 6,000 performers. Viewers saw
President Bush and his wife, Barbara, chatting with other guests as
fireworks lit up the sky.
   Temporary grandstands on the Place de la Concorde held about
16,000 other invited guests, including celebrities and officials.
They also provided seating for French citizens born on July 14 or
with the first name ``France.''
   July 14, or Bastille Day, marks the day 200 years ago when a
group of Parisians stormed a royal prison that once stood at the
Place de la Bastille.
   In an emotional climax of the parade, American opera diva Jessye
Norman, wrapped in the blue, white and red colors of the French
flag, sang the rousing verses of the national anthem, ``The
Marseillaise.''
   Elyiane Picard of Nice, bedecked with revolutionary tricolor
buttons, held on to a few inches of standing space at the base of an
iron fence along the Champs-Elysees for nine hours to watch the show.
   ``The parade is something I never would have wanted to watch on
television,'' she said. ``It's a historic happening, and I wanted to
be able to tell my children I was there.''
   Twelve hours earlier on the same parade route, silver-helmeted
Republican Guards pranced below jet fighters trailing the national
colors in a display of precision, pomp and firepower. More than 250
planes and helicopters streaked down the length of the flag-bedecked
avenue.
   Columns of more than 5,000 men and women, from frogmen to Foreign
Legionnaires, 300 armored vehicles, and unarmed mobile missiles
flowed down the avenue to martial music.
   President Francois Mitterrand reviewed the troops at the Place de
L'Etoile. Then, standing upright in a light reconnaissance vehicle,
he rode down the grand avenue to the Place de la Concorde.
   There, he joined Bush and the other world leaders in the
presidential tribune at the site where the guillotine stood during
the revolution.
   Frenchmen and tourists danced through the night Thursday at balls
around Paris and elsewhere in France. The capital's gala will wind
up later Saturday with the traditional fireworks display at the
Eiffel Tower.
   ``We're here helping to celebrate what we started with our
revolution and the French finished,'' said James M. Young, of
Boston, who brought his family to France for the bicentennial.
   ``This grandeur, beauty, pageantry and feeling of nationality _
this is what we wanted the children to capture.''
   The center of Paris was all but closed to traffic for the day's
events and a security dragnet the government described as the
tightest since World War II was in full evidence. A dirigible with
special security cameras surveyed the crowds before the military
parade began.
