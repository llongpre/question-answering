   President Bush joined President Francois Mitterrand
and more than 30 other world leaders today to commemorate the French
Revolution's ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity.
   The 15-minute noontime ceremony at the Place du Trocadero
launched a busy weekend of bicentennial parties and international
diplomacy, grouped around the annual summit of the seven biggest
industrial democracies.
   Actors read portions of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and
the Citizen, proclaimed in October 1789 before the French Revolution
turned to terror and tyranny. Interspersed were choral segments and
quotations from revolutionary leaders.
   At the end, children dressed in white ran to a stone inscribed
with the declaration and ringed it with wreaths and flowers. Five
hundred doves were released to fly freely into the almost cloudless
sky.
   The presidents and prime ministers, with several hundred invited
guests, sat in warm sunshine overlooking the Trocadero esplanade and
_ across the Seine River _ the Eiffel Tower.
   The leaders arrived in a steady stream of limousines and were
greeted by Mitterrand. A cheer went up from a crowd on the street
when Philippines President Corazon Aquino arrived.
   Among the other guests were Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India,
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Mobutu Sese Seko of
Zaire and other African leaders, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, Brazilian President Jose Sarney, President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti.
   Barbara Bush sat to the left of Danielle Mitterrand in the front
row of a section of temporary stands set aside for the leaders'
spouses.
   The capital was prepared for another Bastille mob scene later in
the day, but unlike the storming 200 years ago that began the French
Revolution, this crowd was gathering for celebration.
   The inaugural concert of the Opera Bastille was expected to
attract a range of dignitaries, including 30 heads of state, and the
cream of French society.
   Operagoers descending the dramatic gray stone staircase leading
to the modern glass-and-steel opera house late tonight were to face
a cultural event of an altogether different sort.
   Thousands of Parisians and tourists will be dancing in the
streets at a bicentennial bash billed as the ``World's Biggest
Ball.''
   The street dance, one of 36,000 outdoor parties taking place in
France during the three-day nationwide celebration, will take
bicentennial bingers into the wee hours of Friday morning.
   A traditional military parade marches down the Champs Elysee
early Friday, accompanied by tanks, fighters and helicopters roaring
overhead.
   In the evening, impresario Jean-Paul Goude's bizarre
opera-ballet-parade called ``La Marseilleise'' will strut and
struggle down the famous avenue in a salute to the international
spirit of 1789.
   Britons will parade in an artificial rain, Russians will dance
with a bear on ice and an American marching band will boogie
backward all the way.
   The parade will be broadcast to millions of viewers worldwide.
   Paris festivities will conclude with a bang, as a spectacular
display of fireworks illuminates the City of Lights on Saturday.
