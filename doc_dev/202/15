   France on Thursday celebrated the 199th anniversary
of the storming of the Bastille, and the president said he was
inviting leaders of rich and poor nations to help fete the
bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   Tens of thousands of people, celebrating the national holiday,
lined the Champs Elysees to watch the traditional grandiose July 14
military parade.
   Planes trailing exhaust in the blue, white and red of the French
tricolor swept low over the Champs Elysees to open the parade of
6,000 men, 120 aircraft, 500 land vehicles and 300 members of the
cavalry.
   President Francois Mitterrand reviewed the troops at the Arch of
Triumph, now draped in tricolor to hide renovation work, then moved
down the avenue to the reviewing stand at the Place de la Concorde.
   Twelve Mirage 2000 Ns, designed to carry nuclear missiles, made
their first public appearance in a sweep over the Champs Elysees,
as Foreign Legionaires with white kepis and the Republican Guard
with feathered brass helmets strutted below.
   More than 4,000 invited guests attended a garden party at the
presidential Elysee Palace, where from a back lawn Mitterrand gave
a televised interview, his eighth such July 14 interview since
coming to power in 1981.
   Thursday night, a massive fireworks display designed to call in
the year of the bicentennial was planned at the Palais de Chaillot,
facing the Eiffel Tower across the Seine river.
   The storming of the ancient Bastille prison on July 14, 1789,
where just seven prisoners were held, led to the fall of the French
monarchy and the proclamation of the republic three years later.
   ``I want the Third World to be present that day,'' Mitterrand
said of next year's bicentennial celebrations. ``This universal
presence in Paris of a world so different in its realities ... is a
great thing.''
   Leaders of the seven major industrialized democracies are to
hold their annual summit meeting in Paris July 14-16, 1989, it was
announced at the Toronto summit in June.
   Mitterrand said Thursday he planned to invite ``many heads of
state or government from poor countries, our African friends, from
Latin American countries.''
