   France uncorked three days of bicentennial hoopla
Thursday by inaugurating a gleaming, high-tech opera house at the
site of the Bastille, the despised prison where its revolution began.
   President Francois Mitterrand, President Bush, and their wives
sat in front-row balcony seats at the Opera Bastille for an opening
concert featuring singers Placido Domingo and Barbara Hendricks.
   Also present were 32 other presidents and prime ministers who
came to Paris for this weekend's celebrations of the revolution's
200th anniversary and for the annual summit of the world's seven
richest countries.
   Sharpshooters were posted on rooftops and in windows of buildings
surrounding the Place de la Bastille as the leaders arrived.
Authorities have clamped tight and highly visible security around
the capital this week.
   Later Thursday, more than 100,000 people jammed into the large
circular plaza for the beginning of the largest of about 30,000
outdoor popular balls around the country to celebrate Bastille Day
on Friday.
   Surrounding streets were packed with people of all ages, enjoying
the balmy summer night. The air was filled with the smell of
grilling sausages and the sounds of exploding firecrackers and
accordion music pouring from a giant white tent opposite the new
Opera.
   ``I usually prefer smaller parties, but I wanted to come be part
of the most popular of French celebrations,'' said Gilles Driate,
from a southeastern suburb. He then grabbed the hand of a surprised
and delighted lady with gray hair, and they danced away.
   Meanwhile, Mitterrand and his guests had a late dinner at the
Musee d'Orsay, the spectacular museum of 19th century art converted
from a train station.
   Earlier in the day at the Opera Bastille, the political leaders
were joined by a star-studded crowd including actress Catherine
Deneuve, tennis player Yannick Noah, and Nobel Peace Prize-winning
author Elie Wiesel.
   A rousing orchestral rendition of the Marseillaise, the French
national anthem, opened the show. The 75-minute program ended with
an even more stirring version, with all the performers joining in.
   Bush, smiling broadly, applauded enthusiastically as the show
closed.
   The visiting leaders earlier joined Mitterrand in an outdoor
ceremony honoring the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the
Citizen proclaimed in 1789.
   Mitterrand was flanked by Bush at the Trocadero, across the Seine
from the Eiffel Tower, during the brief celebration of what many
consider the chief legacy of the French Revolution.
   At the new opera house, Domingo, Miss Hendricks and Teresa
Berganza sang selections from French operas such as Charles-Francois
Gounod's ``Faust'' and Camille Saint-Saen's ``Samson and Delila.''
   France's Georges Pretre conducted the orchestra and chorus of the
Orchestre de Paris in a work titled ``La Nuit d'avant le Jour,'' or
``The Night Before the Day.'' The staging and the stark, elegant
decor were the work of American Bob Wilson, the darling of French
avant-garde theater.
   The Opera Bastille was conceived early in Mitterrand's first
presidential term as a much-needed alternative to the ornate but
inadequate Palais Garnier, known worldwide as the Paris Opera.
   From the start, the project was beset with administrative,
political and financial problems, and it even came close to being
canceled.
   Designed by Canadian architect Carlos Ott, the huge
glass-and-steel building boasts state-of-the-art sound, lighting and
staging technology, including special acoustical fire curtains, a
movable proscenium and electronically controlled stage dollies that
bring in sets for an entire opera in minutes.
   The 2,700-seat main auditorium _ a contemporary blend of black
and white with oak-paneled walls and hardwood floors _ was designed
for acoustics.
   Expert opinion on the new hall was not all positive, however.
Music critic Frank Erikson of the weekly L'Express said he was
``terribly disappointed'' by the hall's acoustics.
   ``The voices do not project into the room,'' he said. ``The
singers were standing at the edge of the stage and yet the sound was
completely muffled. This is quite serious.''
   The Opera Bastille, which is shaped like an ocean liner, was
captainless until May when Myung-Whun Chung of South Korea was named
musical director by Pierre Berge, the financial wizard behind the
Yves-Saint Laurent fashion empire. Berge was chosen by Mitterrand to
oversee the project in its final days.
   Chung, a soft-spoken but determined optimist known as a
consummate artist, fills the vacancy left in January when Berge
fired Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim for his high fees and
elitist ideas about opera.
   Chung has promised to present the first production in February.
The Opera Bastille will close July 20 so the building can be
finished.
   The human rights celebration at the Trocadero was a simple but
dramatic reading of the 17 articles of declaration adopted by the
French National Assembly on Aug. 26, 1789.
   Punctuating the reading was a group of 48 children singing ``The
Song of Joy,'' a hymn composed for the occasion. The choir members,
who have been rehearsing since July 1, were from the United States,
Poland, Finland, the Soviet Union, West Germany, France, Japan,
Rwanda, Togo, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Hungary, Lebanon and the
Philippines.
   The three American singers were from the Phoenix, Ariz., Boys'
Choir. ``We wanted to symbolize peace,'' said Harvey Smith, director
of the Phoenix choir who helped train the Paris group. ``The
children brought things from their world and shared them with those
here today.''
