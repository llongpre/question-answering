   More tourists than ever are flooding Paris,
storming museums, mobbing hotels and crowding cafes to kick off
celebrations marking the French Revolution bicentennial.
   Even though events are just beginning, the Paris Tourism Office
says the capital already has 20 percent more visitors than at this
time in 1988.
   And nationwide, officials expect to break last year's record of
38 million visitors.
   ``There are going to be a lot of people in France,'' said Xavier
Beguin Billecocq, a tourism official with the Maison de la France.
``This year we expect an increase of about 15 percent.''
   Large-scale bicentennial events will begin in May, but plenty of
visitors are already in town.
   Nathalie Paul, a spokeswoman at the Paris Tourism Office, said
hotel rooms were filling up fast.
   ``We couldn't get into the Louvre yesterday. The line was
incredible,'' said Judith Goldberg of New York City. She waited in
line with hundreds of others outside the Musee d'Orsay, the Paris
showcase for 19th century art.
   As many as 50,000 tourists and Parisians have crowded the Louvre
daily since the museum's new pyramid entrance opened on March 29.
The Louvre renovations were scheduled to be completed in time for
bicentennial celebrations.
   But besides visiting the Louvre _ a museum since the early years
of the revolution _ and a few small exhibitions, tourists have few
bicentennial events to attend until next month.
   On May 4, the procession that opened the Estates General will be
recreated in Versailles. Two hundred years ago, the First, Second
and Third Estates _ representatives of the nobility, clergy and
commoners _ met to express the grievances that set the revolution
in motion.
   From May 5 to Nov. 11, Paris tourists can visit a mini-theme
park being set up in the elegant Tuileries Gardens, between the
Louvre and the Place de la Concorde.
   Organizers expect at least 3.5 million people to pay the
equivalent of three dollars to visit the park, which includes two
small cinemas, an exhibition hall, a theater, souvenir stands, two
cafes and six bars.
   Two 118-foot ``Towers of Liberty'' will mark the recreation area
and 32 actors in period costume will perform or wander among the
tourists portraying revolutionary figures.
   The Maison de la France has counted 6,000 bicentennial events
nationwide, from dances and fireworks to arcane academic seminars,
and published a list of 200 considered likely to interest tourists.
   The Eiffel Tower, built for the revolution's centennial
celebrations, marks its own 100th birthday this year, with special
festivities on June 17-18.
   A special U.S. homage to the revolution is scheduled July 8,
with bands from each of the 50 states parading through Paris. That
evening, the American Waterways Wind Orchestra will play from a
barge in the Seine River to a crowd before City Hall.
   The lucky few, including President Bush, will attend the July 13
opening night of the new Bastille Opera. The theater is being built
near where the Bastille was seized on July 14, 1789, the most
memorable event of the confused and turbulent revolutionary years.
   Musicians will play until dawn in what is being described as the
world's biggest ball.
   Bush, President Francois Mitterrand and the leaders of Britain,
West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada will hold the annual
seven-nation economic summit in Paris from July 14-16. Meetings
will be interspersed with bicentennial parades, fireworks and the
like.
   While Paris hosts the largest number of revolutionary
commemorations, the provinces are not left out. Among the
highlights will be an assembly of Tall Ships from July 9-16 in
Rouen and a gathering of 987 hot-air balloons near the small
village of Gouin in eastern France from July 26 to Aug. 6.
