   Brass bands marched down the Champs-Elysees today
and scores of planes streaked across the sky, leaving a trail of
blue, white and red smoke wafting over the heads of hundreds of
thousands of bicentennial revelers.
   Celebrants danced and frolicked into the wee hours this morning
at nearly a dozen places around Paris to celebrate the July 14,
1789, storming of the Bastille prison.
   The thousands of revolutionaries who rushed the hated prison
found only seven inmates to free, locked up not for their politics
but for fraud, incest and lunacy, but the action marked the
beginning of the French Revolution.
   The traditional Bastille Day military parade in the morning
followed all-night partying that briefly got out of hand, resulting
in a 5 a.m. scuffle between a few stragglers that riot police tried
to clear from the Place de la Bastille.
   Three of the baton-wielding policemen were slightly injured as
were an unknown number of others, the French news agency Agence
France-Presse reported. About a dozen people were arrested.
   President Francois Mitterrand rode standing up in a jeep from the
Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, where he took his place
in the parade viewing stands behind bullet-proof glass shielding
more than 30 world leaders in Paris.
   Among those seated in the VIP stands to watch the military parade
were President Bush, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and
President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines.
   Nine bands set the stirring pace for units representing every
branch of the French military, including the Foreign Legion.
   Among the more than 100 planes that swooped over the avenue were
nine Mirage 2000N's, designed to carry nuclear warheads. One
squadron of aircraft trailed blue, white and red smoke, the French
national colors.
   The Interior Ministry press center set up on the avenue estimated
that 1 million people lined the parade route. But police sources
said preliminary indications based on aerial photographs suggested a
crowd of about 300,000.
   A meeting of leaders from the seven major industrialized nations
was to begin this afternoon, coinciding with the festivities.
   The parade was the first of two scheduled today, the second of
three days of bicentennial celebrations that began with a human
rights ceremony Thursday and the inaugural performance at the new
Bastille Opera.
   The concert was followed by street parties all over town.
   A parade tonight was to feature the Florida A &amp; M Marching Band.
   The biggest outdoor ball was at the Place de la Bastille, where
the prison stood before it was burned down during the French
Revolution.
   The enormous circular place was jammed with people of all ages.
People perched on the base of the Bastille monument and the
staircase of the new glass-and-steel Opera Bastille.
   Directly across, a huge white tent sheltered a stage where jazz
musicians, African bands and accordion virtuosos played waltzes,
marches, and other music to the staccato accompaniment of fireworks
exploding in the balmy summer night.
   ``This beats any party back home,'' said Robert McKean of
Alameda, Calif., who took a break from studying French in summer
school to meet his friends at the Bastille.
   Gilles Driate, a computer technician from a Paris suburb, grabbed
the hand of a surprised stranger with gray hair and spun her around
to the music.
   ``I prefer smaller parties, but I wanted to come here this year
to be part of the most popular of French celebrations,'' he said.
   The smell of grilled sausages at sidewalk stands filled the air,
and partygoers uncorked thousands of bottles of wine.
   The inaugural concert earlier at the new Opera Bastille, a
high-tech hall built to bring culture to the masses, was attended by
such celebrities as actress Catherine Deneuve, tennis player Yannick
Noah and Nobel Peace Prize-winning author Elie Weisel.
   A rousing orchestral rendition of the Marseillaise, the French
national anthem, opened and closed the 75-minute show.
   The Marseillaise was to be sung again tonight by American soprano
Jessye Norman on the Place de la Concorde during a second parade
that was to be the centerpiece of the capital's bicentennial events.
   On Saturday, a giant fireworks display across from the Eiffel
Tower will illuminate the city and close the ceremonies.
   With the ouster of the monarchy and the promulgation of France's
Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, many believe the
French Revolution shaped the principles of universal human rights
and laid the foundation for modern democracy.
   However, the revolt was followed by a wave of terror that
eventually produced Napoleon Bonaparte and his military dictatorship.
