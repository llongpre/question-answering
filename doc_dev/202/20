   From I.M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre to
the woefully behind-schedule Bastille Opera, it is the best of times
and the worst of times for the observance of the French
Bicentennial. As the day of the big celebration on July 14
approaches, the French are less enthusiastic about their
bicentennial than Americans were about theirs. ``What is there to
celebrate?'' one Frenchman asks. ``It was a time of shame.''

   Restaurant Le Procope, where Voltaire, Danton and
Robespierre brooded over a beaker of vin rouge, has some interesting
items on its ``Menu du Bicentenaire,'' celebrating the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution.
   For 289 francs, about $43, service compris (tip included), one
may choose:
   _Le Poussin en Bastille _ baby chicken baked in a latticed pastry
crust evoking the fortress prison that fell to the rebels on July
14, l789.
   _La Tete de Veau Docteur Guillotin aux deux sauces _ calf's head
memorializing Joseph Ignace Guillotin, the physician who advocated a
more humane, more democratic method of executing traitors to the
revolution than garroting or breaking them on the wheel. He
prescribed beheading, only to die on his own contraption.
   _La Charlotte Corday et Son Coulis Rouge _ a whipped-cream
dessert with a collar of raspberry jelly in memory of Charlotte
Corday, the convent novice from Calvados who went to the guillotine
for stabbing the murderous madman Jean Paul Marat to death in his
bathtub.
   Alors, since France abolished capital punishment eight years ago,
none of the four surviving guillotines is on display, although one
recently sold at a Paris auction for $40,000. But souvenirs recall
``the national razor that shaved close,'' as Charles Dickens called
the invention that dispatched Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Mesdames
du Barry and Roland, the chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the astronomer
Jean Bailly, Georges Jacques Danton and Maximilien de Robespierre,
among 2,625 in Paris alone.
   The deadly machine that at the height of the Reign of Terror was
severing 60 heads a day is evoked on T-shirts, plates and ashtrays,
plastic key rings, rubber face masks of the doomed king and queen,
and wool shawls inspired by the sadistic harridans who knitted and
gossiped at the foot of the scaffold while heads rolled.
   As part of ``la fete de la Revolution,'' tenor Placido Domingo
will sing the title role of ``Andrea Chenier,'' the poet whose heart
melted as Mademoiselle Corday ascended the guillotine, then lost his
own head when the custodians of the Terror confused him with his
anarchist brother.
   Umberto Giordano's tragic opera is being staged in the gardens at
Versailles, where Louis XVI was busy at his hobby of shooting cats
off the roof that muggy July day when the mob stormed the Bastille.
They had hoped to release hundreds of political prisoners but found
only four lunatics, who were transferred to the asylum at Charenton,
two counterfeiters and a nobleman accused of incest.
   The rebels seized some arms and ammunition and decapitated
Bernard de Launey, the prison governor, parading his head about town
on a pitchfork.
   ``Rien,'' the king wrote in his diary: Nothing of importance
today.
   Next morning the mob began razing the eight-towered prison where
Voltaire once was a guest for hinting that the regent Philippe
d'Orleans committed incest with his daughter and where that young
whippersnapper the Marquis de Sade had time to pen some sexy memoirs
of pleasure and pain.
   Twice a day at rush hour, motorists still storm Place de La
Bastille, with its monument marking the start of the revolution,
creating l'embouteillage, the French word for gridlock, literally
``bottled up.''
   The excavated remains of one of the prison towers is on view in
the Bastille Metro stop. Among a vast collection of bicentennial
artifacts, including Marie Antoinette's prison cell dressing table
and the only statue of Louis XVI to survive the revolution, the
Carnavalet Museum is exhibiting a miniature Bastille carved from one
of the original blocks.
   Contractor Henri Palloy, entrusted with the demolition of the
prison, made a fortune selling these miniatures, but ended up with
his neck in the guillotine. No such consumer protection against
revolutionary schlock is available this time around.
   For President Francois Mitterrand, the bicentennial is the best
of times and the worst of times.
   His pet project, the Bastille Opera, is woefully behind schedule,
torn by political and artistic dissension and the subject of public
ridicule.
   ``C'est une blague'' _ it's a joke _ derided a taxi driver who on
screaming tires skirted the glass-sheathed edifice where on the
bicentennial eve President Bush and other world figures will
interrupt the cacophony of the hard hats to attend a concert with
Mitterrand inaugurating the unfinished auditorium.
