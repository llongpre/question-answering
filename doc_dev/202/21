   Leaders of the seven industrialized democracies
agreed Tuesday to hold a summit again next year, in France, at the
height of the spectacular celebrations that President Francois
Mitterrand is producing for the bicentennial of the launching of
the French Revolution.
   As they closed the 14th annual summit of the world's economic
powers after three days of talks, the leaders said the
get-togethers have been good for their own countries and for the
rest of the world.
   ``The economic summits have helped to sustain the values of
democracy that underlie our economic and political systems,'' said
a draft of the final communique.
   It said the meetings have given the leaders a chance ``to
reflect, in an informal and flexible manner, upon their common
responsiblity for the progress of the world economy and to resolve
how that responsibility should have practical manifestation in the
years ahead.''
   The Toronto summit concluded the second ''cycle'' in which each
of the seven countries in turn acted as host to its peers.
   Next year's three-day gathering in Paris _ starting on Bastille
Day, July 14, the national holiday _ will be the start of another
round of seven meetings running through 1995.
   ``We believe that the mutual understanding engendered in our
meetings has benefitted both our own countries and the wider world
community,'' the leaders said. ``We believe, too, that the
opportunities afforded by our meetings are becoming even more
valuable in today's world of increasing inter-dependence and
increasing technological change.''
   The tradition of economic summits was started in 1975, when
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing invited his counterparts
from the United States, Britain, Japan, West Germany and Italy to
the Renaissance chateau of Rambouillet southwest of Paris for some
informal talks out of the glare of the spotlights.
   In succeeding years, the Canadian prime minister and the
president of the European Economic Community were added to the
annual talks. The discussions have become more tightly structured,
with officials working months in advance on the final communique,
and have attracted ever-increasing platoons of journalists _ some
3,000 of them in Toronto.
   Next year's meeting will be the third in France, and the second
with Mitterrand as host. In 1982, his second year in office, he
staged the summit in the chateau of Versailles, with its atmosphere
of glittering elegance from the days when Louis XIV reigned there
three centuries ago.
   Bicentennial preparations have been under way for years, and
have been a preoccupation of Mitterrand's since his 1981 election.
His re-election last month to a second seven-year term gives him a
chance to preside over the celebrations.
   In his first term, Mitterrand launched such projects as a new
Opera House, renovation of the Louvre museum and construction of a
huge arch in the form of a cube at the western gates of Paris _ all
to be completed in time for the anniversary of the July 14, 1789,
seizing of the Bastille prison which launched the revolution.
   The approach of the bicentennial has sparked a debate in France
over who is the true heir of the revolution's spirit _ the
conservatives with their devotion to individual liberties, or the
leftists _ like Mitterrand _ with their challenge to entrenched
privilege and to the rich.
   Adding the summit to the menu of concerts, historical
reproductions and giant fireworks displays will give the French a
chance to speculate about what such revolutionaries as Danton and
Robespierre might have thought about the gathering of the world's
richest nations.
   While both previous French summits have been held in chateau
settings reminiscent of the nation's Renaissance grandeur, a likely
candidate for next year's meeting is the shiny new
commercial-residential complex of La Defense at the western edge of
the capital, a symbol of a new France of high technology and rapid
modernization.
   Two miles west of the Arc de Triomphe, La Defense is the 20th
century prolongation to the famed east-west axis in Paris, leading
from the Louvre through the Place de la Concorde and along the
Champs-Elysee.
   A showcase of architectural fantasies, the complex houses more
than 300 companies where some 60,000 people work. Nearly 40,000
live in the residential secion.
   Spread over nearly 2,470 acres on a bluff, La Defense is crowned
by a gigantic ultra-modern cube-shaped arch now under construction,
which will be an office building. The design by Danish architect
Otto Van Sprecklsen was chosen personally by Mitterrand.
   La Defense takes its name from a monument on the site
commemorating the defense of Paris in 1871 when the French held off
the Germans in the Franco-Prussian war.
   The complex is a five-minute ride from central Paris on the RER,
a network of suburban express trains linked to the Paris Metro.
