<P>
President Bush, buoyed by his landmark visit to Eastern Europe, joined dozens 
of world leaders today for a spectacular Parisian party celebrating the 200th 
anniversary of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Bush helped kick off the festivities by presenting to France the historic key 
to the Bastille fortress, birthplace of a rebellion against the French crown 
two centuries ago. The key, in U.S. hands since 1790, is on temporary loan. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was greeted by French President Francois Mitterrand at the inaugural 
bicentennial event at the Place du Trocadero commemorating the Declaration of 
the Rights of Man. That statement, issued in August, 1789, set forth the French 
Revolution's aims of liberty, fraternity and equality for all people. 
</P>
<P>
The world leaders sat on a blue-and-white grandstand listening to a young man 
and woman who took turns reading the 17 articles of the declaration. A 
children's choir dressed in white sang a "song of joy," played games and threw 
peace laurels, flowers and children's toys on the esplanade. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the ceremony, the leaders burst into applause as a flock of doves 
flew over the palace. Then, chatting amiably, they left for a lunch given by 
Mitterrand, who sat next to Bush during the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Security was tight with an estimated 30,000 police, including rooftop marksmen, 
guarding the summit events. Police also towed away about 1,000 vehicles as part 
of their ban on traffic in the main thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Mitterrand greeted each leader arriving by limousine at the ceremony 
site near the Eiffel Tower. The crowd in the street cheered when Philippines 
President Corazon Aquino appeared. Other guests included Prime Minister Rajiv 
Gandhi of India, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Mobutu Sese 
Seko of Zaire and other African leaders, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar, Brazilian President Jose Sarney, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari and Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, after a private 40-minute meeting with Mitterrand, Bush took 
part in ceremonies marking the return -- actually a brief loan -- of the key to 
the Bastille, the site where the French Revolution began when the fortress was 
stormed in an uprising against the crown on July 14, 1789. 
</P>
<P>
Bush presented the large iron Bastille key to Mitterrand for display through 
July 22 at the new Bastille Opera house, adjacent to the site of the famous 
fortress. 
</P>
<P>
The key was given to George Washington nearly 200 years ago by the Marquis de 
Lafayette. Since 1797, the key has never left Washington's estate in northern 
Virginia. Since 1858, the historic artifact has been in the possession of the 
Mount Vernon Ladies' Assn., the private, nonprofit organization that owns and 
operates Washington's home.
