   Milwaukee is rolling out the guillotine, New York is
showing what well-dressed nobility wore to the dungeon in 1789 and
dozens of other American cities are planning hundreds of events to
celebrate the bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   ``Americans love a party, they love a bicentennial and they love
France. The French Revolution is a natural,'' said Christopher
Henze, cultural attache at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Henze is
keeping track of more than 300 concerts, exhibits, symposiums,
festivals, film series and TV shows taking place across the United
States in 1989.
   Birmingham, Ala., alone has an events list nine pages long that
includes ``Marcel Proust at the University of Alabama'' lectures,
wine tastings, productions of Moliere's ``Tartuffe'' and cooking
classes by a chef from Paris' famed Le Cordon Bleu.
   The French are enthusiastic about the American revolutionary
fervor and have decided to send the original Declaration of the
Rights of Man and Citizen to an exhibit at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington next spring. It will be the first time
France's most precious document has been on display anywhere since
it was locked away in 1791 when it was embodied as the preamble to
the French constitution.
   The Declaration was drafted in 1789 by Emmanuel Sieyes, the
French statesman and clergyman, and mirrored the ideas of the
liberal Enlightenment. It spoke of the equality of men and the
inalienable rights to security, liberty and property.
   The founding document of the French Republic will be flown across
the Atlantic on April 18 on another source of French pride, the
supersonic Concorde, which will be on view for a short while at the
Smithsonian's Aerospace Museum.
   ``That a single small country like France can have itself
represented by a beautiful jet like the Concorde and a document like
the Declaration of the Rights of Man is incredible,'' said Sir
Valentine Abdy, the Smithsonian's representative in Europe. He has
arranged for a Concorde plane to be given to the Smithsonian when it
goes out of service.
   French musicians and Americans of French ancestry will play on
the Washington Mall June 30-July 4, at about the time the
Smithsonian's New York branch, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, is
displaying the best objects from two centuries of French decorative
art and design.
   The $2.5 million cost of the ``L'Art de Vivre'' exhibit is being
paid by the French Comite Colbert, a group of luxury goods companies
such as Krug Champagne and Hermes.
   Cartier jewelry will sparkle in museums in New Orleans, San Diego
and elsewhere. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York will show
fashions from ``The Age of Napolean: Costume From Revolution to
Empire.'' Artist Gustave Corbet will be reconsidered at the Brooklyn
Museum in an exhibit that will later travel to Minneapolis. And, for
lovers of the printed word, The New York Public Library will offer
the ``Revolution in Print,'' a collection of books, broadsides,
prints, posters, manuscripts and periodicals, many on loan from the
Bibliotheque Nationale.
   French dancers from the Paris Opera Ballet and other companies
will pirouette across stages from North Carolina to Massachusetts.
Daniel Barenboim will lead the Orchestre de Paris on a seven-city
tour including stops in Chicago and at New York's Carnegie Hall. And
French arias will resound in opera halls in Texas, California and
Washingon, D.C.
   Keyboardist Ray Charles and saxophonist Dexter Gordon will swing
with French jazzmen Claude Bolling and Claude Nougaro at Carnegie
Hall in a concert series that will have other musicians jamming at
Washington's Kennedy Center for the Arts, Chicago's Orchestra Hall
and the Los Angeles' Universal Amphitheatre.
   What does jazz have to do with the French Revolution?
   ``Nothing. But it's a chance to celebrate the role of the French
over several decades in giving black American musicians the right to
work, the freedom to express themselves and the support of dedicated
audiences,'' said Edward Tuck, who will produce a television show
from the concerts and have interviews with musicians who have lived
and worked in Paris. Such artists have have included the late
composers and pianists Thelonius Monk and Bud Powell.
   Tuck, who is also president of the French-American Foundation,
said the number and variety of U.S. celebrations reflect America's
awareness that the French Revolution was the basis not only for the
Declaration of Human Rights adopted Aug. 26, 1789, but also for the
U.S. Bill of Rights, adopted 30 days later.
   ``And that is no coincidence,'' he said. ``Ideas ricocheted
between the great thinkers of our two countries. It is the
anniversary of a tradition that produced the common notion that a
government is meant to defend the human rights that each individual
is born with.''
   Celebrations will crescendo on Bastille Day, July 14, when 200
years ago a mob stormed the prison for guns but found only seven
prisoners instead. The day marked the beginning of lower-class
participation in the revolution, which had been led by the
bourgeoisie (middle class) against the aristocrats and the clergy.
   In Milwaukee, more than 200,000 people are expected to attend a
four-day festival where food vendors will cook crepes and frog-legs
kabobs to be washed down with champagne, ``or rather American bubbly
white wine, because it's cheaper,'' said Betsy Kohler, who is
coordinating the event.
   There will be a mock Arc de Triomphe constructed as the finish
line for a midnight run, not to mention the ever-popular guillotine.
   ``We had one last year and everyone liked it,'' Kohler said.
``It's the kind of thing where someone puts their head in a hole and
someone else takes their picture. Also, it's very nicely painted and
has the history of the revolution printed on it.
   ``A lot of people are going to learn about the French Revolution
this year.''
