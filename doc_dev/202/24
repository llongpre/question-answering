   President Bush supplied the key to help unlock the
biggest birthday party in French history Thursday as swanky dinners
and the opera took center stage after the president's four-day trip
to Eastern Europe.
   Bush and more than 30 other world leaders were treated to a swirl
of festivities celebrating the 200th anniversary of the French
Revolution.
   The events ranged from a solemn ceremony commemorating the
drafting of the French version of America's Declaration of
Independence to an offbeat parade capping the celebration Friday
that will feature Russians dancing with a bear on ice, Britons
marching under artificial rain and a Florida band moonwalking up the
famed Champs Elysee.
   To guard against terrorist attacks, 30,000 police were deployed
around the city with rooftop marksmen and even ground-to-air
missiles added to the security dragnet.
   Amid the hoopla of the birthday bash, more weighty issues were
being discussed as well. The president's other reason for being in
Paris was to attend his first economic summit of the leaders of the
world's seven richest nations.
   The 15th annual economic conference among the leaders of the
United States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and
Canada was to feature for the first time a major emphasis on ways to
clean up the global environment.
   With his historic trip to Poland and Hungary still very much on
his mind, Bush indicated he would be urging the other summit leaders
to step forward with assistance packages of their own to further
economic and political reform behind the Iron Curtain.
   Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on the flight from
Budapest to Paris, Bush said he believed his four-day trip had
``given encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform,
political change, economic change.''
   His national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said the
president would encourage his summit partners to create a
``clearinghouse'' to avoid duplication of the assistance packages
offered by the rich nations.
   On the Middle East, Bush said that the United States would not
relax its policy of opposing Israeli settlements in the occupied
territories in order to accommodate political turmoil in Israel, a
country Bush conceded is best by ``great difficulties.''
   Bush was greeted by French President Francois Mitterrand, with
whom he later met, at the inaugural bicentennial event, a reading of
the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the document that proclaimed
in October 1789 the French Revolution's aims of liberty, equality
and fraternity for all.
   At the end of the ceremony at the historic Place du Trocadero,
children threw peace laurels, flowers and children's toys on a stone
inscribed with the declaration while 500 doves were released into a
cloudless sky.
   Bush also participated in a ceremony in which the key to the
Bastille prison was turned over to Mitterrand. The Bastille was the
central Paris prison stormed by the populace on July 14, 1789,
setting off the revolution.
   The key to the fortress had been presented 199 years ago to
President George Washington by the Marquis de la Fayette, who had
served as a general under Washington during the American Revolution.
   The key ceremony represented a brief loan with the artifact
headed back to Washington's home in northern Virginia after the
bicentennial is over.
   Bush and the other world leaders attended the inaugural concert
of the Opera Bastille Thursday night where they descended a dramatic
gray stone staircase leading to the modern glass-and-steel opera
house.
   Mitterand, who considers himself a champion of the rights of the
poor, invited several leaders of poor Third World countries to
partake in the festivities, hoping to formulate a dialogue between
the haves and have-nots.
   Leaders from both the rich and poor nations dined together
Thursday night on an opulent meal of lobster with artichokes, lamb,
Roquefort cheese with figs and nuts and, for dessert, almond ice
cream with apricot sauce. They washed it all down with four
different wines.
   The leaders of Egypt, India, Venezuela and Senegal issued a call
to Mitterrand to help organize a North-South summit between
developed and developing nations and the French president endorsed
the idea.
   East-West relations and developments in Eastern Europe, said
French presidential spokesman Hubert Vedrine, figured prominently in
Mitterrand's 40-minute discussions with Bush. ``The two men are on
the same wavelength,'' Vedrine told reporters.
   He said Bush and Mitterrand agreed the economic and democratic
reforms in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union ``offer a whole new
perspective for the first time in 40 years.''
