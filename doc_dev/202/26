   France brought its glory days to a crescendo
Saturday by saluting its revolution's bicentennial with a storm of
sound and color over the city many French regard as the capital of
the world.
   A 45-minute spray of 170,000 rockets over the Eiffel Tower at
nightfall followed early morning fireworks.
   Before a final bouquet of multicolored bursts in the evening
show, jostling crowds gasped at the piece de resistance: a
200-foot-wide fresco of blue and red framing a white outline of a
ship symbolizing Paris. Blue, red, and white are the colors of the
French flag.
   On Friday night, a parade, created by advertising maverick
Jean-Paul Goude, presented a whimsical blend of history, folklore
and the outer limits of French fancy. Goude described it as two
hours of controlled madness.
   A million people mobbed the mile-long Champs-Elysees to see the
Florida A &amp; M University marching band dance the California worm, a
Russian ballarina waltz on ice skates with a polar bear, and lancers
fling flowing French tricolors like batons.
   Bronx drummers flanked a full-size locomotive, banging on
55-gallon steel barrels. Chinese students wheeled bicycles, solemnly
jingling their bells, under a banner reading, ``We Will Continue,''
a reference to the crushed pro-democracy movement in their homeland.
   On one gigantic float, a conductor-witchdoctor in a tux gyrated
atop a rolling mountain of pounding African drummers. At the summit,
six undulating Senegalese women, dressed in blue, white and red
gowns, depicted a waving French flag.
   Halfway through, singer Jessye Norman electrified the heart of
Paris with ``La Marseillaise,'' France's national anthem. Her
American nationality, organizers said, highlighted the revolution's
universal character.
   But the crux of a thrilling, infuriating weekend the French will
never forget seemed to be the traditional July 14 morning event,
when France paraded its missiles down the Champs-Elysees.
   Behind glass at the Place de la Concorde, President Francois
Mitterrand was flanked by the leaders of 33 nations from five
continents, including six of the richest and some of the poorest.
   He sat between George Bush, president of a superpower, and Felix
Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, symbol of an empire France
colonized and, by its measure, civilized.
   Bicentennial celebrations and a coinciding Group of Seven summit
of industrial nations drove home Mitterrand's message that France
sees itself neither as part of the First World nor the Third but
rather of a separate constellation illuminating the way for others.
   But not everyone shared official enthusiasm for the French
Revolution _ or its 1989 commemoration.
   Many Parisians fled town, unwilling to fete a violent civil war
or simply afraid of the crowds. Some who stayed grumbled bitterly at
the massive security blanket.
   ``To an old Parisian, this reminds me of something I have seen
before, but without the swastikas,'' remarked one old Parisian.
   Many saw ironies in the system of privilege that remains 200
years after the revolution.
   Only those with invitations, or the patience to wait six hours
along the route, got a good look at the parade. Television coverage
mostly missed the zany, impressionist mood.
   Thursday night's street dance at the Bastille was billed as the
world's biggest all-night party. In a twist of history, officers
stormed the citizenry to break it up.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had observed on French
television that human rights originated in ancient Greece and were
affirmed in England's Magna Carta of 1215.
   She called the French Revolution a reign of terror that
contributed little to humanity.
   When Mrs. Thatcher appeared among other dignitaries on giant
screens off the Champs-Elysees, crowds booed.
   But mostly, Paris was a raucous party. People wore silly hats,
bought tricolored underwear and gave little serious thought to
history books.
   The Seine flowed thick with champagne corks, beer cans and other
debris of revelry.
   The well-connected had dinner at dawn with Ms. Norman and singer
Grace Jones at Le Palace. Others simply found the nearest music and
did anything from funky chicken to fox-trot.
   Sometimes, the mood turned ugly as young toughs threw
firecrackers at people's feet or dropped gas bombs into crowds as
thick as bearnaise sauce.
   But many Parisians said they had not seen such gaiety, color and
unabashed outpouring of national pride since 1944, when Allied
forces joined French troops in liberating Paris.
   As the weekend wound down, Mitterrand's chauffeur set out on a
personal mission to carry France's message across the world. He is
leading a convoy of Renault vans to Tokyo, via Moscow.
   Three bear the names associated with the French Revolution since
1789: Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood. The fourth is named Hope.
