   Parisians here see oil derricks instead of
the Eiffel Tower and favor crape myrtles over crepes, but don't
expect them to call July 14 anything other than Bastille Day.
   When Parisians in France toast the 200th anniversary of their
revolution on Friday, their namesakes here will, too _ Texas-style.
   The fete will include a barbecue, quilting contests, music, plays
and ``Tour de Paris'' bike races expected to draw up to 1,500
entrants to this town of 27,000 people 200 miles northeast of Dallas.
   City leaders and businesses started the Bastille Day celebrations
10 years ago thinking, ``Why not?'' said Linda Suarez, program
coordinator of the Paris Chamber of Commerce.
   ``It started out as a downtown merchants' promotion, a sidewalk
sale, real small and kind of quaint,'' she said. But as word of the
festival grew, ``We just thought we'd take advantage of it.''
   France and Texas have fraternal ties, she said. ``France was one
of the first to recognize Texas as an independent (republic) ... and
the French flag was one of the six that flew over Texas,'' Ms.
Suarez said.
   As part of the celebration, about 20 high school girls will
compete for the title of Crape Myrtle Queen, with the winner
receiving a bouquet from the flowering trees.
   Hungry revelers can feast on pastries from ``Marie A.'s Cake
Company,'' named for Marie Antoinette, the haughty monarch known for
saying ``Let them eat cake.''
   The U.S. Postal Service even has a commemorative cancellation
mark for July 14 letters.
   ``It's got a little Eiffel Tower on one side and an oil derrick
on the other,'' Ms. Suarez said. ``Our logo, on little pins, is a
little Eiffel Tower with a cowboy hat on top. ... They're a real big
hit.''
   The only thing missing will be a French dignitary, she said.
``But, they've got their own birthday party.''
