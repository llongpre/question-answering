   American marching bands and majorettes strutted
their stuff Saturday in central Paris in a lively U.S. salute to the
200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   Several thousand people crowded around City Hall and the
surrounding side streets to catch a glimpse of the plumed hats,
fluttering flags and flying batons of the 600 performers.
   The daylong U.S. homage to the bicentennial kicks off a week of
celebrations, culminating Friday on Bastille Day, the 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison.
   President Bush will be among about 30 world leaders in town for
the parades and fireworks, followed by the annual economic summit of
the world's seven largest industrial democracies.
   The Montana Centennial Band, in white cowboy hats and blue jeans,
led the short parade to cheers from crowds along the avenue.
   The Virginia Military Institute's band, in plumed hats and
gray-and-white uniforms, was next down the Avenue Victoria, followed
by the Marching Panthers of James B. Dudley High School in
Greensboro, N.C., the North Springs (Ga.) High School band and the
Lawrence Central (Ind.) High School band, led by flagbearers waving
the American, French and Indiana colors.
   Marching bands are a rarity in France and are considered
quintessentially American, but the most exotic spectacle came last,
with the 28 members of the Touch of Kyle Twirling Club of Kalamazoo,
Mich., spinning their batons, flags and pink rifles.
   The event's announcer, addressing the crowd over speakers mounted
at City Hall, described baton-twirling as ``this very American art,
which consists of marching in time to the music, spinning and
tossing the little batons while executing all sorts of arabesques.''
   The young Americans are participating in a variety of events
marking the bicentennial around France.
   ``I was really proud of our school that we got chosen,'' said
Andrea Varrone, a clarinet player in the North Springs band. ``We've
been touring and shopping. It's been a lot of fun.''
   The Virginia Military Institute band, from Lexington, Va., played
earlier in the day at the inauguration of a renovated square
honoring the United States.
   It is to lead a civic parade in the city of Vendome, 100 miles
southwest of Paris, commemorating ties between Virginia and France.
The band members plan to tour the Ecole Polytechnique, the historic
French military engineering academy that served as the model for the
Virginia Military Institute, which celebrates its 150th anniversary
this year.
