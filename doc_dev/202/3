   France celebrated Bastille Day with music, food,
fireworks and a display of military muscle ranging from World War
II-vintage tanks to state-of-the-art missiles.
   This year's festivities were scaled down from last year's
bicentennial blowout, when about 1 million visitors converged on
the French capital. Tourism officials said about half as many
people traveled to Paris for this year's celebrations.
   For those Parisians who were put out by traffic jams and miffed
by crowds in their favorite cafes last year, the smaller
festivities were a welcome change of pace.
   Bastille Day marks the fall of the Bastille prison in 1789,
generally regarded as the spark for the French Revolution, which
toppled Louis XVI and gave France its first republican government.
   Despite the climate of lessened military tensions in Europe,
France pulled out the stops for its traditional military parade.
   A week ago, Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement underlined
France's commitment to keep a strong conventional and nuclear
force, even as the Warsaw Pact and NATO are negotiating deep
defense cuts in the wake of the democratization of Eastern Europe.
   Thousands of soldiers marched down the Champs-Elysees to the
Place de la Concorde. Jets screamed overhead, sending blue, white
and red contrails to match a huge tricolor fluttering under the Arc
de Triomphe.
   About 600 tanks and other armored vehicles lined the route or
paraded along. The vehicles represent about 15 percent of France's
armored forces.
   Bearded companies of Foreign Legionnaires were fitted out in
desert khakis and their trademark white kepis. The
Napoleonic-uniformed Republican Guards, who provide the ceremonial
security at the presidential palace, trotted along on cavalry
horses, gleaming chrome sabers flashing.
   The French even rolled out their the new Mistral ground-to-air
missile, capable of reaching speeds of 1,864 mph.
   A platoon of World War II-era tanks, similar to those that
liberated Paris from the Nazi occupation 50 years ago, clanked by.
One bore the name ``De Gaulle,'' in tribute to Gen. Charles de
Gaulle, the wartime leader of the Free French. France is
celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth this year.
   A fireworks display was planned for tonight, and showman
Jean-Michel Jarre was giving an evening concert at the year-old
Grande Arche in the financial district of La Defense.
   The concert was expected to draw 2 million spectators. The
government spent $8.2 million underwriting the show so admission
could be free.
