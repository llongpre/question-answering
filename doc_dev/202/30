Bastille Day commemorates the triumph of the populace, the bourgeois, according 
to Marica Hefti of Le Medi in Newport Beach. So she and her chef-husband Walter 
Ruttiman will serve from big pots of moules mariniere, the traditional mussels 
dish, on the restaurant's patio at bourgeois prices -- from $1.75. Also 
available outdoors: seafood salad and strawberries with black pepper. Inside, 
diners can sit down to a dinner of duck Bigarade (with orange), French onion 
soup and chocolate mousse, all for $14.95. The same menu will be served at 
lunchtime, from 11:30 to 3 p.m.; and dinner, from 6 until "whatever," according 
to Marica. Reservations: (714) 675-4904.
