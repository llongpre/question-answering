   The market for bicentennial trinkets is slack and
the streets are clean again, but France and its leaders are still
basking in the glow of their wild bicentennial weekend.
   Until the final moment, the plans to mark the French Revolution's
200th birthday brought waves of criticism.
   The skeptics said Paris would be a nightmare of gridlock, a
whacky parade Friday night would be a disaster and the entire show
constituted an attempt to glorify Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand.
   On Sunday, Mitterrand entoned royally: ``What counts is the
result.''
   Parades and fireworks in the center of Paris attracted the
capital's biggest crowds since the city was liberated from the Nazis.
   ``More than a million Parisians, tens of millions of French
people, and hundreds of millions of television viewers in the entire
world saw on this occasion an image of France particularly rich in
symbols,'' Premier Michel Rocard said in a message to the chief of
the country's Bicentennial Mission, historian Jean-Noel Jeanneney.
   Also watching were more than 30 world leaders, including
President Bush. They came to Paris for the annual summit of the
world's seven richest countries and to attend the bicentennial
festivities.
   Mayor Jacques Chirac and other conservative leaders snubbed the
parades, but even rightist newspapers usually hostile to Mitterrand
saluted the commemorations in rapturous style.
   ``The Triumph of the Revolution,'' the conservative daily Le
Figaro said in a banner headline. In a front-page editorial, it
described Friday night's show as ``colossal, superb and solemn. With
humor as well.''
   The parade along the Champs-Elysees, a flight of imagination
created by advertising specialist Jean-Paul Goude, offered
everything from African drummers to Scottish pipers to the Florida
A&amp;M marching band moonwalking in the style of singer Michael Jackson.
   In a reminder of the price of freedom, hundreds of Chinese
studying in the West marched to solemn music, with headbands showing
the Chinese characters for the French Revolution's watchwords:
``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''
   By Sunday, as festivities grew old, the crowds on the
Champs-Elysees also thinned and slowed down.
   ``Everybody's worn out,'' said Maguelone Fallot, who wasn't
having much luck selling her bicentennial keepsakes on the famous
avenue.
   ``These things are expensive,'' she said, pointing to her $23 wig
in the blue, white, and red of the French flag and a $15
bicentennial tie.
   The capital's street cleaners, in their bright green suits, were
out early Sunday morning to clean up the confetti and other trash.
   The bicentennial ceremonies began Thursday with dramatic readings
from the Declaration of the Rights of Man with the visiting
presidents and prime ministers in attendance.
   That evening, the leaders joined Mitterrand for an inaugural
concert at the new Opera Bastille, built where a revolutionary mob
stormed the royal Bastille prison on July 14, 1789.
   The attack is viewed as the beginning of the French Revolution.
   Friday morning saw France's traditional military parade, showing
more might than ever this year with screeching fighter planes,
rumbling mobile missiles and ranks of military academy graduates.
   Saturday's fireworks were Chirac's contribution, a 45-minute
display with 170,000 rockets.
   However, the most distinctive part of the weekend binge was
Goude's parade, named ``The Marseillaise'' after France's national
anthem but offered as a salute to the ``tribes of the globe.''
   ``The gamble was without doubt a little crazy, but it was won,''
the daily Le Monde wrote in an editorial Saturday. It said the
``surprising and original'' parade ``did not give the idea _ to say
the least _ of a chauvinistic and xenophobic France.''
   Goude's after-parade commentary was simpler: ``I'll try to do
better next time.''
