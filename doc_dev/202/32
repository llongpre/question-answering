   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who seeks a
new revolution at home, visited the site Tuesday where a mob stormed
the Bastille 200 years ago in the uprising that swept away the
French monarchy.
   He began a three-day visit to France by joining President
Francois Mitterrand for lunch, a first round of talks and a
demonstration of Europe's new high-definition television.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, then went to the Place de la
Bastille, where they shook hands with Parisians and tourists at the
scene of the assault on the infamous prison July 14, 1789.
   Thousands of people crowded up to barricades placed around the
spacious square, many shouting, ``Gorby! Gorby!'' as did crowds on
his visit to West Germany last month.
   Reporters surrounded the Soviet leader at the steps of the new
Opera building, to be inaugurated next week in the presence of
President Bush and other Western leaders as a high point of
celebrations marking the revolution's bicentennial.
   Unable to reach more than a few well-wishers, the Gorbachevs
climbed back into their Soviet-made Zil limousine. On the other side
of the square, however, they climbed out again.
   Dr. Jean-Pierre Mach, a Parisian cancer researcher, said he came
to see Gorbachev ``out of admiration.''
   ``No matter what happens, he will be remembered by history as an
exceptional man, a man who has transformed hate to trust.''
   Gorbachev has described his economic and social reform program _
called perestroika, or restructuring _ as ``a revolution without the
bullets.''
   In a dinner toast Tuesday night, Gorbachev said the Soviets
``feel like full participants in your festivities,'' in part
``because perestroika, also, is a revolution.''
   He said Europe had a chance to move beyond divisions that
resulted from World War II.
   ``The postwar period is over. Today a way toward a stable peace
is opening before us, based not on a balance of forces, but on a
balance of real and correctly understood interests. Europe holds
this chance in its hands.''
   Mitterrand said problems remained to be solved before the Soviet
leader's idea of a ``common European home'' could be made real.
   ``Between the two halves of Europe, there are still many
obstacles to clear away, distrust to dissipate, barriers to knock
down before the inhabitants of the future home can feel at ease and
confident there,'' he said.
   For the French revolutionaries in 1789, the Bastille was both a
hated symbol of oppression and a military garrison where they hoped
to find guns and ammunition for defense against an expected attack
by the troops of King Louis XVI.
   They found only seven prisoners and a small stock of weapons, but
the day went into history as the most memorable of the long and
confused revolution.
   Marxist-Leninist doctrine sees the French revolution as a
landmark in the international class struggle, along with the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution that overthrew the czar.
   Although Gorbachev found a warm welcome at the Bastille, more
than 100 people gathered at the Paris stock exchange to demand that
the Soviet government redeem Russian government bonds issued before
the revlution.
   At the Soviet Embassy, about 2,000 Armenian emigres demanded a
meeting with Gorbachev to discuss the grievances of their countrymen
back home.
   The Gorbachevs descended smiling from their Ilyushin-62 jetliner
at Orly airport, where they were greeted by Mitterrand and his wife,
Danielle.
   In their first discussions, which lasted an hour, the two men
spoke of East-West relations, Gorbachev's reforms and conflicts in
the Middle East, Mitterrand spokesman Hubert Vedrine told a joint
news briefing.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, said they might issue
a joint statement appealing for peace in Lebanon and expressing
support for Arab League efforts to end the country's long civil war.
   He said the two countries were discussing an arrangement under
which more natural gas would be sold to France, with the proceeds
used to buy French consumer goods to relieve chronic shortages in
the Soviet Union.
   After lunch, Mitterrand showed Gorbachev the high-definition TV
system intended to compete with U.S. and Japanese versions.
   High-definition TV images are being broadcast as a demonstration
from France's TDF-1 satellite, and Mitterrand is eager to sell the
Soviets on the European system.
   In a separate meeting, foreign ministers Roland Dumas and Eduard
A. Shevardnadze signed agreements to fight drugs, ease access to
public archives, prevent incidents at sea and promote youth exchange
programs.
