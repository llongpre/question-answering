   Just like Paris, this hamlet
deep in wine-growing Burgundy went out of its way to make its
bicentennial celebration an unparalleled event.
   Unlike Parisians, however, the 548 villagers could get a close
look at the fireworks display, the first ever in the history of St.
Gengoux. They also had no trouble parking and didn't complain about
the cost of it all.
   That doesn't mean the festivities were a cinch for mayor Joseph
Pelletier.
   ``We had worries to organize this,'' he said. ``For the official
toast, we had to get our hands on 200 glasses and think who would do
the washing up afterward.''
   With all eyes glued on Paris where world leaders marked the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution in pomp, splendor and grandeur,
hundreds of villages around France celebrated with a simple ``bal
populaire,'' and heaps of food and wine.
   On the eve of Bastille Day, the children of St. Gengoux marched
around the village carrying colorful lanterns. The elders, dressed
in period costumes, followed and chanted revolutionary slogans such
as ``That's enough. We'll hang the aristocracy!'' and ``Down with
the nobility and clergy!'' when they passed the 11th century church.
   But times have changed.
   St. Gengoux no longer has a resident priest, the sole policeman
did not have to protect anyone from the outrage of the people, and
by 3:30 a.m. the locals were swaying to ``Rock Around the Clock'' by
Bill Haley and the Comets.
   One thing was missing, though. For the first time in memory, the
brass band, rich in trophies and local history, did not lead the
procession.
   After the previous mayor lost the March elections, his son and
cousin quit the band, taking with them their bugle and big drum.
   ``What a pity we had to miss that,'' said Pelletier, echoing the
complaints of many villagers.
   But it hardly dampened the enthusiasm during the simple
festivities. ``Here, everything is very down to earth,'' said baker
Jeannot Breton. ``We celebrate among ourselves. We don't have an
orgy of money,'' he said.
   The mayor runs the July 14 celebrations on a budget of less than
$1,500. ``Of course, we don't have to receive heads of state,'' he
said.
   St. Gengoux, basking amid the lush, sloping hills of eastern
France, produces simple Macon white wines from Chardonnay grapes,
but without the fame or prices of the Burgundy wines from around
Beaune, 40 miles to the north.
   Friday's celebrations ended with the bicentennial ``Repas
Populaire,'' a rich five-course meal for about $7.50 a plate, but
with wine and coffee offered by the village. More than 200 people
showed up in the Salle des Fetes, decorated in the French colors for
the occasion.
   During the two days, only one big speech was made, but even then
it hardly resembled the heady rhetoric heard in Paris, where the
Revolution was lauded as one of France's greatest contributions to
humanity.
   The people here have their ideas what 1789 means. In St. Gengoux,
there were attacks during the revolutionary summer to destroy
everything that represented the nobility and clergy but no major
massacres occured.
   ``Like everywhere, July 14 means liberty. We have maintained it
and even abused it a lot,'' Breton said, referring to France's
colonial past. ``When something is forbidden, we are the first to do
it,'' he said.
   The quest for an egalitarian society however has partly failed,
said Pelletier. ``The differences are still there, but they are not
so big as 200 years ago,'' he said. ``Some privileges have
survived,'' he said.
   St. Gengoux will continue to celebrate until the end of July to
commemorate events in the region itself.
   ``On July 14, nothing happened here,'' said Pelletier. ``There
was no television to see live how the Bastille was taken.''
