   The capital launched its celebration of the
bicentennial of the French Revolution on Tuesday night with
fireworks, trumpets and balloons at the Place de la Concorde, where
King Louis XVI lost his head to the guillotine.
   For the occasion, the large statues of eight women representing
eight major provincial cities placed around the huge square were
unveiled. The statues were restored over the past year to repair
effects of pollution made worse by the daily packs of automobiles
that jam the Place de la Concorde.
   As the horns sounded and floodlights blazed, a brief cascade of
fireworks lighted the sky over central Paris.
   The date chosen to kick off the city's bicentennial celebrations
Paris marked the 200th anniversary of Louis XVI's decision to summon
the Estates General, representatives of the three estates ``nobles,
clergy and commoners'' whose meeting in Versailles set the
revolution in motion.
   The king himself was beheaded Jan. 21, 1793, in the 21-acre
square on the Right Bank of the Seine between the Tuileries Gardens
and the Champs Elysees. It was first called Place Louis XV, renamed
Place de la Revolution in 1792, then Place Louis XV when the
monarchy was restored. It finally was given its current name in 1830
in homage to national reconciliation.
   The eight statues around the Place de la Concorde, installed
between 1836 and 1840, represent the cities of Nantes, Brest, Rouen,
Bordeaux, Marseille, Lille, Lyon and Strasbourg.
   Celebrations of the bicentennial year elsewhere in France started
as early as Jan. 1, with the launching of colorful hot-air balloons
from various sites.
   The celebrations are to culminate July 14, the national holiday
and the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison. Other
projects include concerts, festivals, expositions and, on the first
day of spring, planting of Trees of Liberty around the country.
