   The countdown has begun at the Opera Bastille.
   Some 1,500 hard hats are working double shifts putting finishing
touches on the gleaming glass and steel structure scheduled to open
July 13 as the French mark the bicentennial of their revolution.
   French opera buffs hope the high-tech musical complex _ built on
the square where revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison on July
14, 1789 _ will finally put Paris on the international music map.
For the moment, doubts remain.
   The new Opera had been leaderless since last January when Israeli
conductor Daniel Barenboim was fired because of what President
Francois Mitterrand's representative said were his high fees and
``elitist views'' on opera.
   Pierre Berge, the head of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion empire
and the man Mitterrand appointed to manage the project in its final
days, said Barenboim's replacement would be someone who understood
the president's wish to create a ``modern and popular opera''
accessible to the masses.
   Five months of speculation and uncertainty ended last month when
that someone turned out to be Myung-Whung Chung, a 36-year-old
Korean conductor known for his skills as a pianist. Soft-spoken and
unemotional, the new music director said he would be a team player
eager to work ``in harmony and unison'' with Opera Bastille
administrators.
   Warning he would not get entangled in the political infighting
that has beset the project from the start, he said, ``If there is a
fight, and I'll say it publicly right now, I won't fight. I'll just
leave.''
   Although Berge declined to divulge Chung's salary, he said his
five-year contract requires the maestro be in Paris for 27 weeks a
year for a minimum of 30 performances,
   Chung also let it be known he has his own ideas on ``popular
opera.''
   ``Popular means the house is full and people are dying to get
in,'' he said in an interview. ``I'd like to broaden the opera-going
public and see more young people and students in the audience.''
   Meanwhile, workers are busy getting ready for the inaugural
concert, billed originally as the centerpiece of official
bicentennial celebrations to be performed before Mitterrand,
President George Bush and other luminaries.
   French conductor Georges Pretre will conduct the Paris Opera
Ballet Orchestra and Chorus, with a host of international
celebrities performing selected arias from well-known French operas.
The concert will be staged by American director Bob Wilson, the
longtime darling of the French avant-garde.
   The Opera-Bastille's first bona fide operatic production is
scheduled for next February. Although Chung did not reveal the
program, the real star of the show is sure to be the building itself.
   The new Opera is a hulking mass of polished granite, glass and
stainless steel designed by Canadian architect Carlos Ott. Critics
compare it to an ocean liner in dry dock, looming over the Place de
la Bastille in eastern Paris. The prison was torn down during the
revolution.
   A technical wonder, the Opera Bastille is everything the ornate,
century-old Paris Opera is not. The Palais Garnier may be a landmark
known worldwide for its baroque design and Chagall-decorated
ceiling, but it has been inadequate for decades.
   The old Opera has a scant 1,600 seats with unobstructed views and
virtually no backstage, which meant that sets had to be built
elsewhere, dismantled, brought in and reconstructed. The cost was
staggering, and so were ticket prices.
   Tickets to the new Opera Bastille are expected to cost a maximun
of 250 francs (about $40), less than half their cost at the Palais
Garnier, which from now on will be devoted to ballet.
   The Opera Bastille has 12 stages in all, including a main stage
flagged by five stages and an adjoining rehearsal stage identical to
the main stage, plus five identical stages one level below.
   All are fitted with freight elevators, electronically controlled
and motorized wagons on conveyor tracks so that sets for an entire
opera can be moved from rehearsal stages to the main stage within 10
minutes.
   Michael Dittmann, the scenic director who drew up the technical
specifications, calls the Opera Bastille ``practical, not
sophisticated.''
   ``Sophisticated means complicated, and this building isn't
complicated,'' he said during a tour of the building. ``It's very
simple. It's a place where you have a lot of space. Here we don't
have the daily problem of where to put our decor in between
performances.''
   The main stage offers 4,300 square feet of space and is 66 feet
high. It is equipped with 9 elevators, 72 traps and a movable
orchestra pit that can be open or closed in two to three minutes.
   A bridge over the main and backstages allows stage hands to load
the ceiling with carpets, curtains and other decor without
monopolizing the stage. The ceiling is also designed for storage,
thus economizing two hours a day when productions alternate.
   There is ample space for costumes, workshops and storage areas,
connected directly to the main stage. The Opera Bastille is a
musician's dream with rehearsal rooms galore _ three for the
orchestra, two for ballet, two for the chorus, 16 studios for
singers and 12 for musicians.
   While backstage areas are still dusty construction sites, the
main hall itself is nearly ready. On a recent visit, workmen were
busy polishing granite pillars, washing windows, waxing hardwood
floors and installing cushions.
   Despite a glass ceiling and a cold color scheme in white, black
and gray, the atmosphere is pleasant and intimate, aided, in part,
to wooden walls and two tiers of graceful balconies reminiscent of
Japanese pagodas.
   Dittmann says the hall's computer-analyzed acoustics are
excellent. Even the hall's chairs have been designed with acoustics
in mind: There are small holes which allow the sound to pass through
when they are empty.
   A polystyrene joint under the building absorbs vibrations from
the three metro lines that intersect under the Place de la Bastille.
   ``If that isn't enough, the subway cars themselves will be fitted
with special rubber tires,'' he said.
