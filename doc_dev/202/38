   After the scandal attending the firing of Israeli conductor
Daniel Barenboim by couturier Pierre Berge of the house of Yves St.
Laurent, whom Mitterrand chose to run the opera, and the subsequent
resignation of composer Pierre Boulez as artistic director, Korean
Myung-Whun Chung was chosen to conduct an orchestra that still has
44 vacant chairs, including key soloists.
   A current joke in Paris asks, ``What is the difference between
the Bastille Opera and the Titanic?''
   ``The Titanic had an orchestra.''
   The best of times already seem at hand for I.M. Pei's glass
pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre, another project dear to the
heart of the Socialist president, which at first was scoffed at by
art critics and deplored by the citizens. Now thousands wait on line
to descend escalators into the new museum entrance, admiring the way
the diamond-shaped panes reflect the splashing fountains and ever
changing clouds over the Seine against the somber stones of the
Renaissance-style palace.
   The French take their time appraising objets d'art.
Twelfth-century intellectuals deemed excessive the flying buttresses
that support Notre Dame cathedral. Bridge builder Gustave Eiffel's
towering salute to the centennial of the revolution was denounced as
``useless and monstrous'' and ``arrogant ironmongery'' by the likes
of Guy de Maupassant and Alexandre Dumas Fils.
   Laser-lighted and repainted a rich chocolate brown for its l00th
birthday, the 1,064-foot-high lacy iron tower astride four graceful
Gothic arches is still the glory of the Paris skyline and outdraws
all other local tourist attractions.
   The revolution exported to France by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas
Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette is being celebrated with many
refrains from the American bicentennial: fireworks, rock concerts,
street dances, a passage of tall ships from Rouen to Le Havre, a
parade of 5l bands featuring 760 trombones, and a full-sized replica
of the Statue of Liberty flame placed at the beginning of Avenue de
New York by the International Herald Tribune.
   On July l4, when all subways and buses are free, American soprano
Jessye Norman will star in ``Homage a La Marseillaise,'' a show
business extravaganza at Place de la Concorde, where the guillotine
stood.
   Norman will sing the national anthem, written three years after
the Bastille fell. The ``Marseillaise'' was composed by Rouget de
Lisle, a 32-year-old army officer who happened to be in Strasbourg
at the time, spent most of the Terror in prison and later wrote a
less-known anthem honoring the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.
He got an angry letter from his mother when thugs and ex-convicts
from Marseilles marched on Paris singing his song to carry out the
September l792 massacre of 5,000 political prisoners, many of them
priests and children.
   A recent poll in Le Monde showed that most French know only a
little about the major events of their revolution. Numerous magazine
articles and TV commentators make the point that the citizens are
less enthusiastic about the bicentennial than the Americans were
about theirs in 1976.
   The revolution that began as a neighborhood disturbance in the
Faubourg St. Antoine by the sans-culottes, artisans and shopkeepers
who did not wear the fancy knee breeches of the aristocracy, led to
the Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen and the eventual
overthrow of the monarchy. But Napoleon with his whiff of grape shot
was waiting in the wings, not an egalitarian representative
government.
   Since the revolution, France has been governed by five republics,
interspersed with two emperors, three kings and a Fascist marshal.
The goal of Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite is still on the agenda of
most political parties.
   ``What is there to celebrate?'' asks Bernard Laplaud of
Villeneuve Les Avignon. ``It was a time of shame. The revolution
brought the Terror and then Napoleon, who made France a lot of
enemies.''
   Laplaud, a heating contractor, was installing a new furnace in
the penitentiary at Marseilles when France last executed a criminal,
a pimp convicted of murder. He recalls that the sentence was
``delayed for several hours because the ancient truck delivering the
guillotine from Paris broke down along the way.''
   Bicentennial celebrants nostalgic for the last time they saw
Paris will have difficulty finding comfort at any of the surviving
vespasiennes, the street urinals named for the Roman emperor who was
the first to provide public toilets. These endangered species are
rapidly being replaced by chiraquiennes, mod, cylindrical pay
toilets nicknamed for Jacques Chirac, the conservative mayor of
Paris who is a proponent of pay-as-you-go economics.
