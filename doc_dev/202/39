   Tourists coming for the bicentennial of the French
Revolution next month may find out that they picked the worst of
times.
   They will have to stay in a hotel far from the capital. A parking
space in Paris might be just as tough to get.
   Motorcades for the 30 or so presidents and prime ministers will
whiz through streets, and authorities will deploy 30,000 police _
two-thirds from out of town _ during the July 11-17 peak of
festivities.
   Tourists flock to Paris every summer, but officials say the
number of visitors already is considerably larger than last year.
During the bicentennial period, about 3 million tourists are
expected to flood this city of 2.3 million people.
   With a bit of luck, a tourist can still find a room this month.
Next month _ forget it.
   ``Impossible,'' says a woman at the hotel reservations counter of
the Tourist Office on the Champs-Elysees. ``You'll have to go at
least 100 kilometers (60 miles) outside of Paris. Paris is booked
solid.''
   Many VIPs will be attending a July 14-16 summit of the seven
major industrial nations, and their entourages will fill hundreds of
hotel rooms.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev is coming to town July 4-6, followed by
Corazon Aquino of the Philippines. Also attending celebrations are
10 African presidents, six North and South American presidents, six
Asian presidents, and six prime ministers or presidents from Western
Europe, with baggage. Among those attending is President Bush.
   The elaborate preparations for the foreign leaders have left many
people grumbling.
   ``Allowing a few dozen privileged people to be lodged and to move
about tranquilly must not in any way be done to the detriment of
hundreds of thousands of other people,'' elected officials from the
Greens Party wrote to President Francois Mitterrand.
   Police have put together a security and traffic strategy worthy
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   For the crucial week of July 10-17, parts of central Paris will
be off- limits to all motor vehicle traffic and no cars allowed to
park on the streets. All vehicles must be removed from those areas.
Permits must be sought for delivery trucks and residents heading for
garages. Taxis may carry passengers into the areas.
   Special parking lots are being set up in the Bois de Vincennes
and Bois de Boulogne, forests on the east and west extremities of
Paris. That could seriously upset the thriving transvestite
prostitution business in the woods.
   Officials have played down the inconvenience.
   ``At least once in our lifetime, we will have seen the heart of
Paris without cars, without trucks, without exhaust fumes, without
backfiring motors,'' said Premier Michel Rocard.
   The Louvre will be shut down July 13-15 for security reasons
while delegations gather at the art museum for sessions.
   And the ``bateaux mouches,'' the tourist boats that ply the
Seine, will drop anchor those three days because they will not be
allowed to use their Alma bridge terminal.
   July 14 is Bastille Day, the 200th anniversary of the storming of
Bastille Prison that started the revolution.
   The Tourist Office said about 100 families have responded so far
to calls for private citizens to rent rooms to visitors.
   ``And we certainly will have more,'' says Florence Quercia,
director of the Champs-Elysees office. ``If you have any problems,
come and see us.''
