   POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) _ French West Indians celebrated
Bastille Day with parades and a cultural festival featuring hundreds
of artists, dancers and singers from 15 Caribbean nations.
   Guadeloupean independence activist Luc Reinette was greeted by a
crowd of about 500 cheering supporters late Thursday night as he
stepped off a plane from Paris.
   Reinette and seven other Guadeloupean nationalists jailed since
the early 1980s on charges of terrorism were granted amnesty
Wednesday by the French government, a gesture aimed at coinciding
with the bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   Local television and radio broadcast the Bastille Day
celebrations in Paris Thursday and Friday.
   Bicentennial revelers in Pointe-a-Pitre watched French air force
Mirage jets that flew from Europe this week perform low-level
acrobatics, leaving trails of blue, white and red smoke, the colors
of the French flag.
   Thousands of army conscripts marched in parades in Pointe-a-Pitre
and Basse-Terre, the two largest cities of Guadeloupe, and in
Fort-de-France, Martinique.
   As overseas departments, the eastern Caribbean islands of
Martinique and Guadeloupe, each with a population of 340,000, are
integral parts of France.
   The theme of the Guadeloupean Arts Festival was the bicentennial
of the French Revolution, symbolized by the July 14, 1789, storming
of the Bastille prison by a Parisian mob.
   Several policemen accompanied Reinette on the flight, and more
than a hundred were at the airport to prevent disorder when the
independence leader arrived. Reinette was also greeted by his
parents, wife, and two children.
   ``France should not think it is off the hook by freeing us,''
Reinette told the crowd at Le Raizet International Airport. ``France
must initiate a veritable dialogue.''
   The independence movement is virtually non-existent in Martinique
and has never garnered more than 5 percent in elections in
Guadeloupe.
   After a wave of terrorist bombings here in the early 1980s left
eight people dead, Reinette was arrested in 1984, escaped shortly
afterwards and was arrested again in 1987 and jailed in Paris. The
bombings ended with his arrest.
   Reinette was the leader of the outlawed Caribbean Revolutionary
Alliance.
   Nations and territories represented at the festival included
Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Dominican
Republic, St. Kitts, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, Barbados, St.
Vincent, Trinidad, Anguilla, Antigua, French Guiana, Mexico and Peru.
