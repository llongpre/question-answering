VIVE LA FRANCE! Friday July 14 brings the bicentennial celebration of Bastille 
Day, and many of Orange County's French restaurants promise gala festivities. 
The Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach will offer a designer fashion show in the 
afternoon, an artist to sketch the guests, door prizes every half hour and 
cancan dancers (!). A methuselah of champagne (that's six liters, no less) will 
be opened to toast the evening. For reservations, call (714) 673-3440.

DINNER EPICENTER: We knew it all along, but Nation's "Restaurant News" confirms 
that households in Orange County spend more in restaurants than those in Los 
Angeles. We're third in the nation, behind San Francisco and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
'ROUND AND ABOUT: Hemingways in Newport Beach is in escrow, but the prospective 
owners don't plan to change the name or the dining concept . . . John Rader, 
whom many remember from Chanteclair and the Balboa Bay Club, is new GM at 
Bistango in Newport Beach . . . Rick and Diane Buford (he publishes Wine Line 
and will be remembered from the Hobbit, Alfredo's and the Golden Truffle) take 
over the Black Sheep Bistro in Tustin from Tom Harrison and Maribeth Seaton, as 
of July 14. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE MOVE: After 20 years in its Santa Ana location, Nieuport 17 will move to 
Tustin after the first of the year. The new restaurant is under construction in 
Lafayette Plaza at Newport Avenue and Irvine Boulevard . . . Showley-Wrightson 
will relocate in a new, larger spot with banquet facilities, just three-fourths 
of a mile away in Newport Beach. A February opening is planned . . . 
Negotiations are under way for J.J. Shaw to move JJ's Bistro from Dana Point to 
the site now occupied by Gandhi in South Coast Village, and for Gandhi to move 
around the corner to the spot vacated by the Belgian Waffle Inn . . . A new 
Royal Thai is abuilding in Dana Point, targeted for an end-of-the-year opening.

LEGALITIES: Delaney's Restaurants and its owner, Francis Delaney, have filed 
for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The chain has agreed to 
be acquired by an unnamed corporation . . . Gemmell's in Costa Mesa also has 
filed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws. The problem, according to Byron 
Gemmell, is with payroll taxes, not purveyors, "but we had no choice but to 
file." The restaurant will remain open "while we restructure and pay off." 
</P>
<P>
NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY: Ristorante Italiano Primavera is the new bambino on the 
block across from Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley. A trio of owners -- 
Piero Intotero, Michael McCord and chef Angelo Juliano -- will herald their 
opening all during July with a four-course special dinner. The $15.95 repast 
includes an entree of breast of chicken and prawns in white wine sauce or veal 
scallop with eggplant, tomato sauce and mozzarella.

At Tom Brown's Bicycle Cafe in Dana Point, the only "smoking section" is on the 
patio outside. The moderately priced restaurant, next door to a health club at 
Del Prado Avenue and Amber Lantern Street, accents the healthy and offers a 
separate vegetarian menu. John Hicks is chef.

<P>
The Restaurant at Cameron Court in Santa Ana boasts a new seafood bar in its 
Cameron Deli. Offerings include oysters and clams on the half shell, smoked 
fish and sea mussels.

lunch and Sunday brunch, with the emphasis on California freshness. Owners

contemporary artists.

Avenue in Huntington Beach. They're serving Mayan, Mexican and Yucatan . . .

Irvine Hilton and Towers and tune up for the weekend with "TGIF and All that 
Jazz-Dixie Style" parties every Friday from 4:30 to 8:30 on the hotel's
