   Many haute couture shops in chic districts closed
their doors in dismay at picnicking tourist crowds celebrating the
bicentennial, but restaurants, cafes and bakery shops did a brisk
business.
   Party-goers, their mouths stuffed with pastry, seemed to make a
mockery of the disdainful Revolutionary era remark about letting the
hungry mob eat cake.
   But by the wee hours of the morning Saturday, when one famished
reporter was looking for nourishment, there was nothing to be found.
   ``Ah, Madame, we don't have a crumb of bread left to eat,'' was
the reply at one establishment.
   The French Revolution seemed to have come full circle.

   President Francois Mitterrand has been accused of favoring pomp
over the people for his lavish three-day bicentennial blast. But he
cannot be accused of nepotism.
   As the chief of state presided over the grand and mighty military
parade marking Bastille Day, his brother, retired Gen. Jacques
Mitterrand, slipped discreetly into a vacant seat in a press stand,
first wiping the dusty chair clean with a piece of paper.
   Asked his thoughts about his brother's alleged notions of
grandeur, the general begged off. ``A big subject,'' he said in
English, then added: ``I'm just a member of the public.''

   The most constant complaint during the bicentennial celebrations
has come from citizens on wheels prohibited for security reasons
from driving, or even parking, their cars in much of central Paris.
   ``The French Revolution was for the abolition of privileges,''
grumbled one taxi driver angered by the inconvenience caused by more
than two dozen visiting foreign leaders.
   ``These heads of state are nice guys and I have nothing against
them,'' he said. ``But I have the right to make a living.''
   In typical Gallic fashion, the taxi driver, eager to vent his
emotions, expounded freely on his revolutionary heritage. But also
typical, he feared identifying himself by name, saying he could lose
his job if his complaints were made known.
   Reminded that liberty and the rights of man were at the essence
of the Revolution, he gave a knowing wink. ``True. But, some people
in this country have more rights than others,'' he said.

   Eight tow trucks, all honking their horns in a victory salute,
tooled down the Boulevard Montparnasse the other night, dragging
illegally parked cars like captured prey.
   French police have been unforgiving about keeping the sealed-off
city center car-free to accomodate bicentennial festivities.
   The cars are taken to lots in the Bois de Boulogne in western
Paris and the Bois de Vincennes in the east. About 1,000 were towed
in the first 24 hours of the clearing operation. The only charge to
the car owner is the price of a taxi ride out.

   Reporters covering the summit of the leaders of the major
industrial democracies have been treated to a tantalizing array of
French food: mousses, pates, duck, roast beef, salads and tarts for
dessert. The dishes are painstakingly prepared and presented on
starched tablecloths. Fresh flowers abound.
   One day, amid the lavish culinary outlay, stood five bottles of
ketchup _ apparently an attempt by the French to appeal to all their
guests' tastes.

   Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno and President Hossain
Mohammed Ershad of Bangladesh exchanged original gifts at a
bilateral meeting in Paris this week. They gave each other books of
their own poetry.
   The 66-year-old Japanese leader, who hails from a sake-brewing
family, writes haiku in his spare time. He has published three books
of his poetry, one of which he gave to Ershad, according to Japanese
officials.
   A sample of his work was published in an official biography
handed out to foreign press at the summit. Written in May as Uno
flew across Siberia, it recalls his imprisonment in World War II in
the Soviet Union:
   ``On that prisoner's path
   ``Where I pulled a wooden sled
   ``Now the leaves of spring.''
   Ershad gave Uno a book called ``Selected Poems,'' one of four
books of poetry he has published.
