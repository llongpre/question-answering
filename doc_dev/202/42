   Hundreds of schoolchildren screaming for the head of
King Louis XVI stormed a mock-up of the Bastille prison on Wednesday
in a re-enactment of one of the French Revolution's most dramatic
moments.
   Dressed in period costume, about 500 children from the northern
Paris suburb of St. Denis gathered at the Place de la Bastille to
relive the event that would inflame revolutionary passions
throughout the land 200 years ago.
   Giant puppets on stilts representing the king, Queen
Marie-Antoinette and revolutionary leaders Danton and Robespierre
acted out their roles while the children played the impassioned mob.
   Blue, red and white balloons sailed into the sky and confetti and
streamers flew as the children called for a march to the Bastille,
recreated in white, red and blue styrofoam blocks.
   When the signal was given, they tore the blocks down and jumped
into the fray.
   While many children were content to watch the spectacle, others
said they knew exactly why they were there.
   ``Storming the Bastille was important because that's how the
peasants got arms,'' explained 9-year-old Christophe. ``The peasants
were ready to revolt because they were starving, they had to pay
taxes the aristocrats didn't.''
   The children, aged 6-12, spent months preparing for the event,
which was sponsored by the public schools and recreation centers of
St. Denis, a working-class suburb. Some learned revolutionary songs
and dances. Others concentrated on understanding why the revolution
took place.
   ``With young children, all you do is to explain basic ideas like
the abolition of privilege and slavery,'' said Danielle Monteils, a
first-grade teacher. Her pupils came in revolutionary costumes that
Mrs. Monteils and her mother made during the winter vacation.
   Organizers said the re-enactment was important because it allowed
some of the children to see Paris for the first time.
   ``They live in low-income high rises and have never seen old
buildings like the ones in this neighborhood,'' said Joelle Porro,
the head of St. Denis' 32 recreation centers. ``Many of them come
from disadvantaged families and have few educational opportunites.''
   The event was one of hundreds being held throughout France this
year to mark the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
