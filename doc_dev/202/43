   More than 1,200 people needed treatment for
injuries and other medical problems after taking to the streets for
a sound-and-light extravaganza capping Bastille Day, the Red Cross
said Sunday.
   About 2 million participants packed the banks of the Seine River
and avenues leading to the financial-district suburb of La Defense
to watch the mammoth concent by Jean-Michel Jarre on Saturday night.
   The Red Cross said Sunday that 22 of the revelers were
hospitalized for injuries. It gave no details of their injuries.
   Another 1,200 spectators sought relief at first-aid stations,
the agency said in a communique. It said most of those seeking
first aid were in need of water, sugar or rest.
   The show capped daylong festivities featuring a military parade
and a pledge by President Francois Mitterrand to keep French
nuclear and conventional forces independent and strong.
   The holiday celebrates the fall of the Bastille prison in 1789
that marked the beginning of the French Revolution.
