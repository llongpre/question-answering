   Barbara Bush concluded a 10-day trip to Europe
on Tuesday marveling about the newly renovated palace where she
stayed in the Netherlands but saying she wasn't impressed by a
massive military parade she watched in Paris.
   ``I'm not crazy about military parades,'' she confessed. ``Once
you've seen one tank, you've seen them all and 200 is too many.''
   She said her remarks probably would get her in trouble but
insisted that the tanks ``all looked alike.''
   Mrs. Bush discussed the trip to Poland, Hungary, Paris and the
Netherlands in an airborne interview on Air Force One on the flight
home from Amsterdam.
   Last Thursday, France rolled out tanks, armored personnel
carriers and other examples of military muscle in a parade that was
part of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Bastille Day,
marking the beginning of the French Revolution.
   On Friday, there was a Bastille Day parade of marching bands,
extraordinary floats and other attractions, including opera star
Jessye Norman singing the French national anthem.
   Clearly, Mrs. Bush preferred the second one.
   ``Actually, one bursts with pride over Jessye Norman. It makes
you want to, you know, rev up those missiles and run out and fight
for France,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   The first lady said she really enjoyed the last stop in the
Netherlands, where she and President Bush stayed at Nordeinde
Palace, the pale yellow, newly renovated ``working palace'' used for
official functions and government offices.
   ``We slept in a sleigh bed last night with an enormous'' wood
frame, she said.
   ``They have a 12-foot swimming pool that has a current'' of
moving water, she added. ``And I got in and swam for 40 minutes in a
12-foot pool and just stayed there and swam.
   ``It's a wonderful thing,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I never saw
anything like it.''
