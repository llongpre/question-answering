ON THE RECORD: MUSIC FROM THE FRENCH REVOLUTION

Marc-Antoine Charpentier's harmonic vision, his ability to create splendid 
contrasts between his vocal and instrumental forces, were part of a revolution 
in French music that took place a century before the more celebrated (and 
bloody) social and political Revolution of 1789. 
</P>
<P>
The glories of Charpentier's style are exemplified in his 1692 "Te Deum," at 
once music with the trumpets-and-drums swagger we associate with the Court of 
Versailles and a work of the sweetest Italianate lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of the "Te Deum," as centerpiece of a program of the composer's 
liturgical works (on Harmonia Mundi France 901298), is by the vocal and 
period-instrumental forces of Les Arts Florissants under the direction of 
William Christie, who produced results that are both admirable for their 
scholarship and irresistible for their joyous energy. 
</P>
<P>
Among the music that was making the rounds at the time of the storming of the 
Bastille was that of Etienne-Nicolas Mehul (1763-1817), whose four symphonies 
are played by the Gulbenkian Foundation Orchestra of Lisbon under Michel 
Swierczewski on a pair of Nimbus CDs (5184/5). 
</P>
<P>
On present evidence, Mehul's most noteworthy quality, aside from the 
aimlessness of his slow movements, is his general disdain for French models in 
favor, variously, of Haydn, Weber, Rossini and particularly Mozart and 
Beethoven, whose G-minor (K. 550) and Fifth Symphonies, respectively, are 
tediously constant -- if not necessarily conscious -- points of reference. 
</P>
<P>
It was as a composer of operas that the Italian-born Luigi Cherubini found 
favor in his adopted French homeland around the time of the Revolution. But 
while there are occasional revivals of his 'Medee" and "Anacreon" in Europe, 
Cherubini's broader reputation today is based on Beethoven's admiration for his 
works (the feeling was not reciprocated), for his having instructed an 
ungrateful Berlioz in the rigors of counterpoint, and for writing a series of 
powerful, if severe, works for chorus and orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The best known of these is the Requiem in C minor commissioned in 1817 to 
commemorate Louis XVI's execution by guillotine a quarter-century earlier. It 
is scored for mixed chorus (without soloists) and a late-Beethoven-sized 
orchestra with the addition of bass trombone and tam-tam, both used to stunning 
effect in the "Dies Irae." 
</P>
<P>
The Requiem, which has past identifications with Arturo Toscanini and Carlo 
Maria Giulini, has now been entrusted to the less exalted hands of the young 
East German conductor Claus Peter Flor, who nevertheless leads it with 
commanding sensitivity. His Berlin Symphony makes a brave sound, and the Berlin 
Radio Chorus is well balanced and accurate. The live-performance recording is 
gorgeously lifelike (RCA 60059). 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Cherubini, Berlioz did not disdain martial pomp, as witness his 
"Symphonie funebre et triomphale," written in 1840 to celebrate the 10th 
anniversary of the July Revolution that toppled the absolutist regime of 
Charles X. 
</P>
<P>
In his memoirs, Berlioz recalls the disastrous premiere, which found him 
conducting a military band of 200 musicians while walking backwards -- Berlioz, 
not the band -- along one of Paris' main boulevards toward the Place de la 
Bastille. 
</P>
<P>
"As we were marching," Berlioz writes, "nothing could be made out more than 10 
yards away. Finally, the National Guard, tired of standing in the blazing sun 
in the Place de la Bastille, began to march off to the accompaniment of some 50 
side drums maintaining a relentless barrage throughout the Apotheosis" (the 
symphony's rabble-rousing finale). 
</P>
<P>
"That," he continues, "is how they regard the role of public occasions in 
France: By all means let it figure as an attraction -- for the eye." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best way to hear this music is on recordings, particularly when 
presented as lustily as it is (on Nimbus 5175) by British trumpeter/conductor 
John Wallace and his 60-odd member wind ensemble, the Wallace Collection. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace augments the Berlioz with band music from the (first) Revolutionary 
period by Gossec, Cherubini and Rouget de Lisle, his "Hymne a la liberte" -- a 
k a "La Marseillaise" -- in Wallace's arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The last-named is sung with appropriate abandon, in a language purported to be 
French, by the Leeds Festival Chorus, which also adds its obscure mouthings to 
the "Symphonie funebre."
