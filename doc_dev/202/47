   High-wire artist Philippe Petit walked a tightrope
soaring over Paris to the second level of the Eiffel Tower on
Saturday, and said later his biggest problem was trying not to have
too much fun.
   With a brisk breeze blowing off the Seine River, Petit leaped
onto the rope at the Palais de Chaillot and walked 2,300 feet on a
cord set at a 16-degree angle to the Eiffel Tower's second level,
330 feet above the sidewalk.
   Thousands of people watched breathlessly as he crossed the length
of more than seven football fields on a wire as thin as three
pencils, occasionally stopping to salute the graceful tower.
   On his balancing bar was a copy of the Declaration of the Rights
of Man, the enduring statement of social justice and liberty that
emerged from the French Revolution in 1789.
   ``My head was full of pure and beautiful things, I felt a
profound joy, almost like a child, an engulfing elation,'' Petit
said afterward, looking windswept and tired but triumphant.
   ``The hardest part was not letting my joy surpass the control I
needed to continue. I was invaded by a joy that was almost dangerous
because I had my life in my hands.''
   With well-wishers and the press on hand, Petit announced that his
next walk would be across the Grand Canyon next summer.
   Petit, known for his dangerous walks between the towers of Notre
Dame Cathedral and New York's World Trade Center, slid down a
gossamer thin rope to the second floor of the Eiffel Tower and
delivered the declaration text into the hands of Paris Mayor Jacques
Chirac.
   His slender 5-foot-7-inch frame was decked out at the beginning
in a silver jumpsuit with sky blue scarves dangling from his arms
and legs.
   Early on in the walk, he stripped off the costume by French
couturier Thierry Mugler and was left in a multi-colored body
stocking that made him look like a small exotic bird against the
blue sky.
   He lay down, carelessly dangling a leg off the wire. He stopped
to admire the monuments of Paris. He waved his arms and kicked his
feet.
   ``Magnifique, formidable, super,'' bubbled 8-year-old Joanna
Bosc, who added that she enjoyed the show.
   Eighteen-year-old Fleur Saltes came 60 miles from the town of
Meaux to see the spectacle and said it was worth the trip.
   ``It was really scary because of the wind, but it ended
wonderfully,'' she said.
   The walk was the highlight of celebrations marking the
bicentennial of the Declaration of the Rights of Man.
   Partying continued Saturday night at a concert sponsored by
President Francois Mitterrand under the monumental cube of the new
Arche de la Defense.
   An international line-up of performers played in the nationally
televised concert, including American diva Barbara Hendricks,
Senegalese singer Youssou Ndour, American jazzman Eddy Louiss,
French rocker Jacques Higelin, African swinger Manu Dibango, popular
Algerian singer Cheb Khaled and others.
   The events brought to an end a busy summer of bicentennial
celebrations, which climaxed with parades and fireworks on July 14,
the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille Prison.
