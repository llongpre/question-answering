   Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Paris this week will
include a trip to the Bastille and talks with President Francois
Mitterrand that likely will cover France's unwillingness to discuss
reducing its nuclear force.
   The trip comes one week before France celebrates the bicentennial
of the French Revolution and plays host to a summit of the seven
major Western industrialized nations. It will include a visit to
Strasbourg, where the Soviet president will address the Council of
Europe.
   Gorbachev, who arrives Tuesday, will be the first leader from the
East bloc to speak at the council. He is expected to define more
precisely the European role of a Soviet Union that has strived to
restructure its economy.
   ``A very important political declaration from the Soviet
leadership to the European public and political leaders on the
subject of a common European house will be the thrust of the
speech,'' said Andrei Grachev, deputy chief of the Communist Party's
international department, speaking to reporters at a briefing Friday.
   The ``common European home,'' an idea first expressed during
Gorbachev's visit to France in 1985, has been a vague concept in
Soviet diplomacy as the Kremlin seeks to improve relations with its
Western European neighbors. The term implies an end to the Cold War
and a change in Soviet foreign policy.
   Gorbachev is expected to use his speech to spell out the kind of
cooperation the Soviets are looking for in human rights,
environmental protection, culture and the battle against terrorism.
   In talks with Mitterrand on Tuesday and Wednesday, Gorbachev is
likely to bring up once again France's own nuclear arsenal, which
the Soviets see as an adjunct of the U.S. nuclear force.
   During his last visit, Gorbachev made sweeping arms control
proposals that later were the basis for U.S.-Soviet disarmament
negotiations. But he failed to bring Mitterrand into separate talks
on reducing France's independent nuclear force.
   The French Socialist president told Gorbachev then that it was
``not reasonable to think that there could actually be
negotiations.''
   A spokesman for the presidential palace said Friday that
Mitterrand would like to discuss chemical weapons with his Soviet
counterpart as well as regional conflicts such as Lebanon and
Cambodia.
   The French president also would like to see a reversal in the
trade deficit with the Soviet Union _ $318 million in the first
three months of this year compared to $773 million for all of 1988.
   In 1988, the main Soviet exports to France were oil and gas while
France imported primarily machinery and equipment.
   Gorbachev also plans to tour the Place de la Bastille on Tuesday,
where on July 14, 1789 workers stormed a prison fortress, unleashing
events that led to the French Revolution.
   On Wednesday, he will sign a series of Soviet-French agreements
and have meetings with Mayor Jacques Chirac, Premier Michel Rocard
and then with students and intellectuals at the Sorbonne University.
   Gorbachev will meet with Mitterrand again Thursday before leaving
for Strasbourg.
   The visit to France, which took over the rotating chairmanship of
the European Economic Community on July 1, is not expected to break
new ground in French-Soviet relations. Nor will the 58-year-old
Soviet leader find the French as effusive as the West Germans, who
thronged his stops during his visit there last month.
   Still, polls show Gorbachev to be far more popular with the
French than President Bush. The Paris Match-B.V.A. poll last week
showed Gorbachev inspired confidence in 60 percent of 1,000 French
people surveyed while only 51 percent felt the same about Bush.
   ``He is more charismatic than Bush and better known,'' said
Dominique Moisi of the French Institute for International Relations.
   ``But the French expect much less of him than the West Germans
and they are more skeptical of the Soviet Union. Besides, French
crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than German ones.''
