   Hatred of tyranny inspired the revolutions that
led to independence for the United States and France, retired U.S.
Chief Justice Warren Burger said Friday.
   U.S. and French officials gathered on the steps of the Jefferson
Memorial to mark the 200th anniversary of the storming of the
Bastille.
   Youngsters sang the ``La Marseillaise'' and ``The Star Spangled
Banner,'' the U.S. Army Band played the French march ``Father of
Victory,'' and senators joined in reading the French Declaration of
the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the U.S. Bill of Rights.
   French Ambassador Emmanuel de Margerie said the ideas of
Voltaire, Rousseau and other French thinkers of the Age of
Enlightenment inspired Thomas Jefferson as he wrote the Declaration
of Independence.
   ``The winds from America blew over France'' with their message of
liberty, democracy and human rights, he said.
   Iaugurating a postage stamp marking the French Revolution, U.S.
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the fall of the Bastille
was a triumph of ``patriots over tyrants who made peaceful
revolution impossible.''
   Burger, Frank and U.S. Army Secretary John O. Marsh Jr. said the
military contributions of the Marquis Gilbert de Lafayette, Admiral
de Grasse and General Rochambeau hastened victory in the American
War of Independence.
   Burger said the two nations inspired each other in their hatred
of tyranny, and that if the French violence was more severe it was
because ``the provocations that led to your revolution were more
severe than those that led to ours.''
   Sens. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., and John Warner, R-Va., and
former U.S. Solicitor General and Harvard Law Dean Erwin N. Griswold
read portions of the French Declaration and the U.S. Bill of Rights,
adopted in August and September 1789, respectively.
   Frank said the new 45-cent U.S. international airmail stamp shows
three statues representing liberty, equality and fraternity
superimposed on a red, white and blue tricolor. Its issuance was
coordinated with issuance of France's own bicentennial stamps.
