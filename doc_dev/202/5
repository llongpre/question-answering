   In Paris, Texas, two French visitors became instant celebrities.
Philadelphia waiters raced with champagne. And passengers at a New
York City airport received loaves of French bread.
   Thousands of Americans on Friday celebrated the French's
bicentennial of Bastille Day. It marked the July 14, 1789, storming
of the Bastille prison in Paris, the start of the French Revolution.
   But the celebration in Paris, Texas, beginning Friday and lasting
through the weekend, opened with a problem _ no French
representatives.
   Linda Suarez of the Paris Chamber of Commerce said she couldn't
lure French officials to the northeast Texas town of 27,000 for the
celebration, which includes a bike race called the Tour de Paris.
   So when French residents Jean Claud Savouret, 57, and Dennis
Perraut, 38, arrived at the festivities, they became honored guests.
   ``They'll be our special ambassadors,'' Suarez said after meeting
the two, who were visiting friends in the area.
   Said Perraut: ``I feel glad for us as Frenchmen to celebrate in
Paris, Texas.''
   In Philadelphia, 115 waiters and waitresses carrying full bottles
of champagne ran 11 blocks, opened the bubbly and served it with
style to a panel of judges. They were after a free trip to France.
   Competitors, who also carried a glass of water and a French flag,
had to finish with the water glass at least half-full and the
champagne bottle intact.
   Ali Niknam, 37, won. John Rojas, 23, a Colombian native, was
second.
   ``I ran for the Spanish people in Philadelphia,'' Rojas said.
   Passengers at a LaGuardia Airport terminal got loaves of French
bread and the Parks Department presented ``Les Inconsolables,'' an
accordian-and-torch song group, in New York City's celebration.
   Cast members from the Broadway musicals ``Les Miserables'' and
``Phantom of the Opera'' attended a Bastille Day luncheon to benefit
a soup kitchen.
   There was one Bastille Day controversy in New York, though: An
American artist harboring a 13-year grudge burned a French flag in
front of the French Consulate. Richard Lance Corey said he was
protesting treatment of artists at an exhibit in Paris held in
December 1975 and January 1976.
   And in Chicago, the Chicago Surrealist Group passed out leaflets
denouncing the anniversary events as ``a trivialization of an
important landmark of human freedom.''
   One French-owned hotel in a Chicago suburb featured a giant
guillotine made of cream puffs and a sugar model of the Bastille at
its bicentennial celebration.
   In Wyoming, three French climbers on Friday ascended the Grand
Teton, the three peaks that cap the Teton Range. Mountain guide Art
Peters said the Bastille Day climb was a joint project with three
Americans climbing in Chamonix and Mount Blanc, France.
   Peters said the Tetons were first discovered by French fur
trappers in the early 1800s who named them ``Les Troix Tetons,''
meaning the three breasts.
   Farther west, at Hollywood Park racetrack in Inglewood, Calif.,
organizers of a bicentennial celebration on Sunday continued to
build a 50-foot-high layer cake.
   The cake, which was to be attached to a frame today, was to
include two models of Paris' Arc de Triomphe stacked atop one
another, with a version of the Eiffel Tower across the arcs.
   ``I think it's the largest cake you can build without a
foundation system,'' said architect David Davis, one of its
designers. Originally, the cake was planned for 100 feet, but that
would have required a building permit.
