   China on Monday accused France of continuing to
interfere in its domestic affairs by allowing Chinese students to
march in the Bastille Day parade in Paris.
   Hundreds of Chinese students wearing headbands with the Chinese
characters for ``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' rode bicycles in
the parade Friday. They carried a banner saying, ``We carry on.''
   During a meeting with the French Ambassador Charles Malo, a
Foreign Ministry official called it ``an attack by insinuation
against the Chinese government.''
   The official noted the students participated in a celebration
that was attended by dozens of heads of state and broadcast live to
many countries, ``thus creating a very bad impact throughout the
world.''
   He also said France has ``repeatedly taken actions unfriendly to
China,'' but did not elaborate.
   China repeatedly has criticized France for giving refuge to
leaders of the crushed pro-democracy student movement, among them
Wu'er Kaixi.
   The Foreign Ministry official also said a group of youths
attacked the Chinese Embassy in Paris on Friday, smashing
second-floor office windows and prying away a copper doorplate.
   It was the second time China has protested an incident at its
embassy in France. China says a group of people occupied the embassy
June 29 and harassed the staff.
   Relations between the two nations have been strained since troops
put down the student movement on June 3-4, killing hundreds _
perhaps thousands _ of people. France froze contacts at all levels
two days later.
   Attache Jean Poncet said regular contacts up to the ministerial
level continue, but they are ``not always pleasant contacts.''
   On Friday, the French community in Beijing marked the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution with a brief ceremony that
contrasted sharply with the festivities in Paris.
   The French Embassy originally planned an all-night party with
bands and orchestras, dancing, buffets and fireworks in the city's
diplomatic section. Instead, about 200 of Beijing's French community
attended a one-hour ceremony at the embassy.
   Malo read the first two articles of France's first Declaration of
the Rights of Man and the Citizen, but ``he didn't speak (and)
didn't mention China at all,'' Poncet said. The document, approved
by the National Assembly in 1789, upholds the rights of all people
to freedom and equality.
   ``We didn't feel it was right'' to hold a larger celebration,
Poncet said, explaining the embassy didn't want to invite Chinese
officials.
   ``Not because of the persons themselves, but because they
represent (Chinese) institutions,'' he said.
