   In this the bicentennial of the French
Revolution, France's influence as a world power is waning. Be that
as it may, a large proportion of Frenchmen insist Charles de Gaulle
proved a generation ago that even a France on the ropes is a vital
force in the world.

   Divided at home, humbled abroad, the French
resolutely resist the judgment of a growing number of outsiders that
the nation has slipped into the second ranks of world power.
   France's economy is three-quarters the size of West Germany's, a
third of Japan's. Its latest foreign adventure, a relief attempt in
Lebanon, ended in debacle. Its influence in Africa is melting away.
   Although France keeps its own nuclear arsenal, it is edging
closer toward NATO, seeking a part in the vast electronic air
defense and battlefield command system planned by Atlantic allies.
   Steadily, its once influential foreign policy is slipping into
the shadow of West Germany.
   The comfortable old channels of domestic politics are blurred by
rebellion at the center, a new appeal by ecologist candidates toward
the left and anti-immigrant extremism at the far right.
   Traditional values are changing at an unprecedented pace. Young
rockers, new conservatives, rootless travelers _ the ``new tribes,''
according to pop commentators _ splinter sectors of society.
   And the nation that traces itself back to feisty Gauls who stood
up to Caesar is joining 11 European partners in a dream of unity a
popular French thinker calls a ``Darwinian nightmare.''
   Whatever indicators might show, however, a sizable proportion of
Frenchmen insist Charles de Gaulle proved a generation ago that even
a France on the ropes is a vital force in the world.
   Jacques Chirac, the former premier who lost presidential
elections last year to Francois Mitterrand, told reporters recently
that France was a waning power only because it acted like one.
   ``Gaullism is not an ideology, but a way of behaving,'' said
Chirac, now mayor of Paris, before leaving for New York to talk
about France on the bicentennial of its revolution.
   Chirac, a conservative who heads France's neo-Gaullist Rally for
the Republic party, argued that countrymen from across the political
spectrum subscribed to what the former president represented in
rebuilding postwar France.
   ``General de Gaulle followed two basic concepts, a certain idea
of the nation, and a certain idea of man,'' he said.
   ``Exactly,'' said Philippe Gillieron, marketing director for the
Eiffel Tower, who considers the soaring steel girders a symbol of
what France means to the world. He explained:
   ``Economically, if maybe we're bigger than Togo, or even Greece,
we're no major power. But in culture, for our ideas on human rights
and the evolution of humanity, we have an active, distinct role.''
   When the Eiffel Tower opened 100 years ago, Gillieron said, it
marked a new epoch of industrial prowess. Today, he said, centennial
festivities heralded a revolution in global communications.
   ``After all,'' he concluded, ``the Eiffel Tower is as well known
to the world as Coca-Cola.''
   Mitterrand is hard at work realizing an old dream, to build the
world's most modern library. According to the plan, work starts in
1991 on the billion-dollar complex, covering 17.3 acres.
   To emphasize its role as at least a symbolic power, France is
celebrating its bicentennial with everything from a string of
summits to sheep on the Champs Elysees.
   A two-hour July 14 parade, named ``La Marseillaise,'' included
Chinese break-dancers among the 8,000 participants from around the
world.
   Counting such monuments as the Opera Bastille, a glass pyramid
for the Louvre and new gold leaf for the Invalides dome, the cost
ran into the billions of dollars.
   Frenchmen who date their history back 2,000 years, not 200, tend
to dismiss the revolutionary rage as unseemly. Many regard
image-building abroad as a diversion from pressing problems at home.
