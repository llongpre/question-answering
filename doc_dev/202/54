   A multimillion-dollar opera-ballet starring 8,000
dancers and musicians, 100 sheep, two elephants and a locomotive
will highlight July 14 celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the
storming of the Bastille prison.
   The parade, titled ``La Marseillaise,'' is sure to be ``powerful
and joyful,'' Culture Minister Jack Lang said Tuesday as he
presented the project to reporters.
   It is a two-hour spectacle that will begin under the recently
restored Arc de Triomphe and go the length of the Champs Elysees to
end dramatically at the Place de la Concorde. American diva Jessye
Norman will sing the French national anthem _ also titled ``La
Marseillaise'' _ behind a backdrop of water.
   ``Then the sheet of water will open like the Red Sea, and gather
up all the performers,'' said Jean-Paul Gouze, who created the show.
   The Florida Marching Band from Tallahassee will march backward,
dancing the ``moonwalk'' choreographed by Michael Jackson and
playing the tunes that made soul king James Brown famous. Tanks
with lights, sound and confetti will trail the band.
   About 1,500 drummers representing French regional cultures and
traditions will be dressed in sailor suits topped with flaming hats
shaped like birthday cakes, while musicians from Nevers in central
France keep tune with the sound of a chugging steam engine.
   Two hundred British bagpipers and drummers will think they never
left home as special effects recreate the thick London fog.
   Among others, China will be presented by dancers and martial
artists, African countries are providing zebras that will prance
behind women dancers, and Soviet acrobats will perform stunts under
a mock snowstorm and a giant skating rink evoking the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution.
   The musical score has been composed by Wally Badarou of Benin.
   Each egment has been conceived like ``a scene in a movie with
its own lighting and special effects,'' said Goude, who was rock
star Grace Jones' manager.
   He said ``La Marseillaise'' cost $15.6 million to produce and
will be broadcast worldwide to 100 million TV viewers.
