   American tourists will top the list of visitors
expected to swell the nation's coffers by participating in the July
celebrations of the French bicentennial, the tourism minister said
Thursday.
   Tourism Minister Olivier Stirn said he expected a 2.5 million
Americans in France this year as France celebrates the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution, centered on Bastille Day on
July 14.
   He said the ``bicentennial factor'' would significantly improve
tourism income and help France move up from fourth slot to recapture
first place worldwide as a tourist destination.
   ``While July is usually relatively empty in Paris with hotels
only 50 percent occupied, this year there will be almost full
occupancy. We anticipate between 30 and 40 percent more foreigners
will visit the capital and the Paris region,'' Stirn told
France-Inter radio.
   In 1988, tourism brought in $3.8 billion, compared with $3.3
billion in 1987, he said.
   Stirn estimated France could attract up to 5 million Americans in
the next two years. As of July 1, American tourists no longer need
to obtain visas to make visits of up to three months in France.
