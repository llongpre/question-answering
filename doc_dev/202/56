   How dare The Wall Street Journal overlook Tom Paine on its Bastille Day editorial page (July 14). 
Editorial top billing went, instead, to Paine's nemesis Edmund Burke, opponent of American independence, albeit sympathetic with many colonial causes. 

   While Burke deplored from afar the sanguinary wrongs in revolutionary France, Paine was on the scene, as one of only two foreign deputies to the French National Convention, doing his moral best to replicate the American revolutionary experience. 

   Publication of Paine's "Rights of Man" peaked the Paine-Burke feud by rattling the feudal shackles still extant in Britain. 
Paine was tried and convicted, in absentia, for his seditious frankness; possession of his influential pamphlet was made a crime. 
But the man on the street, in England as in France, understood and believed Tom Paine when he declared in his "Rights of Man," "Whatever is my right as man is also the right of another; and it becomes my duty to guarantee as well as to possess." 

   No wonder the key to the Bastille was entrusted to Paine by the Marquis de Lafayette, to be forwarded to George Washington, as a symbol of liberty. 

   Well said, Tom; the Journal's oversight stands corrected.
