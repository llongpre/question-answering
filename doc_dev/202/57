   The French released hot air balloons in 98 locations
Sunday to launch the bicentennial of their revered revolution after
preparations hampered by disorganization and modern-day political
strife.
   They also ushered in the New Year by turning on special lights on
the Eiffel Tower to mark its 100th birthday. The lights reading
``100 Ans,'' or 100 years, stand 13 yards high and will be kept on
all year both night and day at the Paris monument.
   The balloon launchings are among the first of many special events
to be held throughout the year to celebrate the 200th anniversary of
the French Revolution. Festivities are to peak July 14 on the 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison in 1789, an event
that has come to symbolize the revolution.
   Organizers acknowledged criticism in recent months that they were
far behind schedule in planning the bicentennial events after the
deaths of two Bicentennial Mission chiefs forced quick changes of
leadership.
   Moreover, French pride in the watershed historical event did not
prevent political bickering over how to remember it. At one point,
Paris' conservative mayor Jacques Chirac, who lost to Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand in May elections, complained that the
government wanted to emphasize those historical details that would
serve their cause today.
   Also in Sunday's kickoff ceremonies, a red and yellow helium
balloon took flight at Paris' Tuileries Gardens carrying a man
dressed in a wig and period costume. And 300,000 souvenir envelopes
bearing a commemorative stamp showing three stylized birds went on
sale around the country.
