The evening began with the French way of greeting, hellos followed by a flurry 
of kisses on both sides of the cheeks. The French also have their way of 
putting on a dinner party, which was really what Sunday night's festivities 
were all about. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner laid to rest the theory that too many cooks spoil the consomme. 
Michel Richard of Citrus, Jean-Claude Bourlier of Le Dome, Patrick Healy from 
Champagne, Claude Alrivy from Le Chardonnay and Michel Blanchet from L'Ermitage 
toiled together in Blanchet's kitchen preparing a five-course meal -- the 
caloric count of which, one guest pointed out, was "off the wall." 
</P>
<P>
As the evening's hostess, Dora Fourcade, the glamorous 30-year-old 
Tahitian-French owner of L'Ermitage restaurant put it, "the French love to have 
fun and they love to throw an elegant fete and any excuse is good." 
</P>
<P>
Her excuse is good: The upcoming bicentennial of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Richard's Brainchild 
</P>
<P>
It was actually the brainchild of Citrus' Richard to gather some of Los 
Angeles' top French chefs to create a sort of three-star picnic and fair on 
July 16. (The fair will be held at Hollywood Park and is open to the public.) 
So the July 16th Committee was born, chaired by Fourcade and including on the 
committee Patrick Terrail of Ma Maison, Madeleine Don Salat of Le Cellier, 
Pierre and Esther Pelech of Pierre's Los Feliz Inn and Robert Robaire of 
Robaire's. The restaurateurs agreed that any proceeds of the July 16 
celebrations would go to the Pro Musicis Foundation, supporting young musicians 
in France and the United States, and another yet-to-be-determined children's 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night's "Diner Grand Siecle" at L'Ermitage was the pre-revolutionary 
teaser, as it were, setting the mood in all its extravagance for what will 
follow. Taittinger Champagne flowed like, well, water from a garden hose before 
a drought. Strains of lute music filled the air. Decorator Claude Lecourt piled 
the restaurant with antiques -- paintings, vases and the most precious pieces, 
a pair of 18th-Century girandoles, which he admitted were not exactly French. 
"They are Hungarian," Lecourt said, "but they are period." 
</P>
<P>
Guests were also encouraged to dress in period, which a few actually attempted. 
Artist Andre Miripolsky in a Napoleonic blue velvet frock coat (and psychedelic 
painted shoes) noted that the "major advantage of living in the 18th Century 
was wig wearing." He allowed that his own hair, beneath the dense brown 
ponytail, was "sparse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Candidate for Guillotine 
</P>
<P>
Wearing an elaborate court dress, Marceline A. de la Poterie, president of the 
Club Culturel Francais, volunteered that she felt very much at home. "I come 
from a very distinguished French family. We were landowners, and I'm sure in 
another life I was at the court. I'm not kidding," she said intently. "But on 
the 14th of July (Bastille Day) I will be guillotinee," she added giggling. 
</P>
<P>
Fourcade admitted that the wardrobe she found at Western Costume for herself 
and the restaurant's entire staff was a bit of a geographical stretch: 
"Everyone is in costumes from 'Amadeus,' " she shrugged, as she and her skirt 
swished through the room. 
</P>
<P>
The meal was also period, or as period as possible, starting with appetizers of 
crepes filled with celery root and caviar ("they used to eat a lot of root 
veggies," Richard said), followed by consomme, duck pate, salmon, venison and a 
trio of desserts. "When you look at those old cookbooks, they used to eat 14 
courses -- it was endless," noted Francine Bardo, general manager of the Hermes 
shop on Rodeo Drive. "This is meant to be a representation. They couldn't put 
us through that." 
</P>
<P>
Richard denied that there was a clash of egos -- or recipes -- in the kitchen, 
and just to make sure, he insisted that the menu (replete with spelling errors) 
listed courses without the names of the corresponding chefs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Kick-off Dinner 
</P>
<P>
Yet another kick-off dinner will be held June 3, headed by Jennifer Grant, who 
was at the party wearing a non-revolutionary gown by Christian Dior. The 
daughter of the late Cary Grant will set sail for Paris this fall to study 
French cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he was "gung-ho" on the upcoming salute to the revolution, 
honorary co-chair actor John Forsythe, who as vice president of Hollywood Park 
arranged for the race track's cooperation, said: "We are recognizing one of the 
great human events of our time. The French gave us Marquis de Lafayette, 
Brigitte Bardot, crepes suzette, Monet, Manet, Degas, Debussy -- why shouldn't 
we recognize them?" 
</P>
<P>
Celebrations on July 16 will include a re-created French street, regional 
foods, jugglers, fire-eaters and musicians, the special $100,000 Bastille 
Stakes horse race and a French village ball in the evening. Admission will be 
$7 at the gate, children under 12 free, or $5 if purchased in advance at 
participating French restaurants.
