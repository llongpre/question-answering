France's biggest party in 200 years got off to a roaring start Thursday night 
with wild dancing in the streets, an inaugural performance in the stunning new 
"people's" opera house at the Place de la Bastille and a nasty little tiff with 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
As President Bush, French President Francois Mitterrand and 32 other world 
leaders watched from balcony seats at the costly and controversial new Bastille 
Opera, across the square from the site of the prison that was demolished at the 
start of the French Revolution in 1789, the orchestra broke into a rousing 
version of the "Marseillaise" to begin a program of selections from French 
operas, including George Bizet's "Carmen" and Camille Saint-Saens "Samson and 
Dalila." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100,000 Celebrants 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the early evening performance, after the 34 leaders and their 
34 fleets of bullet-proof limousines and escort cars had finally departed, the 
Bastille Square filled with more than 100,000 celebrants. As rock music blared 
from a temporary stage erected next to the new opera, the cool night air filled 
with smoke from exploding firecrackers and sizzling sausages cooking on open 
grills. 
</P>
<P>
By midnight, the square was too packed for anyone to truly dance, and the 200th 
birthday party had evolved into a kind of adolescent-style happening. Still, 
there were about 30,000 other bals populaires taking place all over France on 
the eve of Bastille Day where traditional dancing -- tangos, polkas and waltzes 
-- and accordion music could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bastille Day, Parisians will be treated to the annual military parade 
down the Avenue des Champs Elysees as well as a wacky $15-million nighttime 
parade, featuring elephants, oil-can drummers and dancing bears, that was put 
together by eccentric French-American advertising man Jean-Paul Goude and 
rehearsed secretly on a French air force base. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of events Thursday night was the Bastille Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have described the $400-million glass-and-concrete building, designed 
by Canadian architect Carlos Ott, as looking like a "ship in dry dock." 
President Mitterrand is known to detest the design and prefers reading to music 
anyway. The new opera was at the center of an international controversy when 
music director Daniel Barenboim was fired in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15-Minute Ovation 
</P>
<P>
But none of this seemed to matter Thursday night as Bush, his wife Barbara, and 
most of the other national leaders and their spouses joined in an enthusiastic 
15-minute standing ovation for opera singers Placido Domingo, Barbara 
Hendricks, June Anderson and others who performed on the technologically 
advanced new stage. 
</P>
<P>
As his gift to the new opera house, Bush presented Mitterrand with an original 
key to one of the cells at the Bastille Prison. 
</P>
<P>
The key was originally given to George Washington by the Marquis de Lafayette, 
but since 1858 it has been the property of the Mount Vernon Ladies Assn. The 
association is lending the key to France for the Bicentennial. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, many of the 2,700 people in the audience turned to applaud 
mitterrand, the 72-year-old french leader who is taking advantage of the 
bicentennial to show off several of his monumental building projects, including 
the opera, a $300-million pyramid addition at the louvre museum and a 
$500-million arche de la defense, which will be the main site of the 
seven-nation economic summit this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
One world leader who did not appear to be having as much fun as the others was 
Britain's Thatcher, who was met with boos and hostile whistles from the crowd 
on at least two occasions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of her visit here Thatcher was interviewed by the newspaper Le Monde 
and a French television network. In her remarks, she managed to outrage the 
French government and much of the citizenry by saying that the 1789 Declaration 
of the Rights of Man and Citizen, the centerpiece of the Bicentennial 
celebration, did not originate with the French. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly not," the British leader said on the Antenne-2 network, "They date 
back much further than that. We have our own Great Charter (Magna Carta) of 
1215 and the notion of human rights goes back to the ancient Greeks and even 
further." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview in Le Monde, Thatcher took a swipe at the extravagantly 
festive, self-congratulatory celebrations being staged by the French to honor 
the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a peaceful revolution in 1688," she said, "in which the Parliament 
imposed its will on the monarchy. We celebrated this event last year, but 
discreetly." 
</P>
<P>
The French found nothing discreet about these comments. She was heartily booed 
as she left a short noontime event at the Palais de Chaillot honoring the 
French Rights of Man. She was booed again by a large crowd along the barricades 
of the Place de la Bastille when she left the opera house in her armor-plated 
limousine after the performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thatcher in Back 
</P>
<P>
Intentionally or not, the Mitterrand government placed the British leader in 
the back rows of the assembled world leaders at both the Rights of Man ceremony 
and the opera performance. Her motorcade was also one of the last allowed to 
leave the opera house area, behind even that of Zaire leader Mobutu Sese Seko, 
the self-described "supreme guide" of his country, who came to Paris without an 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of dictator Mobutu has caused a minor stir among some of the other 
Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of us came to celebrate the Revolution," said a member of the 
delegation from India. "He came to celebrate The Terror." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand felt that by inviting the Third World leaders to the Bicentennial 
celebrations, he could foster dialogue between them and the leaders of the 
group of seven leading industrial democracies, including Bush, who will begin 
meeting here this evening. He was also sensitive to the charge that it might be 
considered poor taste to host a meeting for the world's seven richest nations 
on the anniversary of France's popular uprising. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his efforts, he has been forced in recent days to defend not only 
his celebration but also the French Revolution itself. 
</P>
<P>
"For those of us who serve the Republic and democracy," he said in an interview 
with the American ABC television network, "the 14th of July is our fete." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to charges that he had turned the Bicentennial into an imperial-style 
event, with lavish meals and gala events such as the Bastille Opera opening, 
Mitterrand said: "When you receive friends, you put your house in order. You 
put flowers in the vases. You organize a dinner that is a little bit better 
than an ordinary family meal. That does not mean you are receiving your friends 
in an imperial fashion." 
</P>
<P>
According to the official estimates of the French government, the costs of the 
Bicentennial festivities will exceed $70 million. The total cost of the 
building projects -- the Louvre pyramid, the opera and the Arche de la Defense 
-- will exceed $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the celebration is at the center of the continuing feud between 
Mitterrand and his main political foe, Gaullist party leader Jacques Chirac, 
who also happens to be mayor of Paris. The Mitterrand government charges that 
Chirac ran up a bill, paid for by the national government, of more than $13 
million on one 90-minute party June 14 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
the Eiffel Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Chirac says Mitterrand is exaggerating the numbers to hide his own excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding today's parade and other events planned here, the mayor of Paris said 
Thursday, residents "would be wise to leave town."
