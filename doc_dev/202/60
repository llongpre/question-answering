</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early in the show, two men ablaze but in special asbestos suits will ascend the 
Eiffel Tower while 53 others jump off it, tied by elastic cords. 
</P>
<P>
Later, rock singer Johnny Halliday, known as "the French Elvis," will roar onto 
a huge stage, built at the foot of the tower, in the company of 100 
leather-jacketed motorcyclists and their bikes. From the stage, from barges in 
the Seine, from holes in a giant birthday cake at the Palais de Chaillot, will 
emerge music, dancers, tightrope walkers, fashion models, fireworks and laser 
beams. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Ronald Reagan and his friend, Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris will 
unveil the 76-foot tall cake. One thousand chefs will pour out of the huge 
pastry, with candles and slices of cake for le peuple. 
</P>
<P>
Happy 100th birthday, Eiffel Tower! Happy 200th anniversary, French Revolution! 
</P>
<P>
The cost of Mayor Chirac's 89-minute party tonight for several hundred thousand 
guests: $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
No matter, it seems. This is no time for prix fixe. This is a time of 
Revolutionary excess and Bicentennial one-upsmanship in the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone by arch-rival Chirac, his opponent in a bitter presidential 
election last year, President Francois Mitterrand, has invited President Bush, 
29 other world leaders and an estimated crowd of 2 million to his own party for 
the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, July 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitterrand party, a parade that will include elephants, horses painted to 
look like zebras and the Florida A &amp; M Marching Band doing the moon-walk 
down the Avenue des Champs Elysees, is expected to cost $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Chirac and Mitterrand deny any revelry rivalry. However, Mitterrand 
was not invited to Chirac's party tonight. Nor was Chirac invited to 
Mitterrand's fete next month. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no competition between the two," insisted Chirac aide 
Thierry Aumonier. "It is a simple matter of protocol. It is the mayor of Paris 
who invites. President Mitterrand was not invited." 
</P>
<P>
Although the president was snubbed, Aumonier said Chirac did invite Minister of 
Culture Jack Lang, a Mitterrand ally, "who will be given a position of honor 
right next to Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
Each show has an eccentric director with his own ideas of how to celebrate 
history. Promoters for Chirac's Eiffel Tower party, directed by Olivier 
Massart, describe it as an event that "combines Jules Verne and Fellini -- an 
enormous naive event that mixes the wildest imagination with the glory of 
industrial performances. Living artists mix with enormous pictures on 
unpalpable screens." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand's fete is more playful, reflecting the elfin personality of 
Jean-Paul Goude, a veteran American and French advertising man. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid," said Goude, "I always dreamed of putting on a show at the 
Theater of the Champs Elysees," a musical and dramatic theater near the famous 
boulevard. "Now they have offered me the whole Champs Elysees. How could I 
refuse?" 
</P>
<P>
Goude's show will also benefit from Mitterrand's position as commander-in-chief 
of the French military. In addition to 8,000 extras, 1,500 drummers and a 
90-foot steam-belching train engine with 20 men pounding on oil drums, 3,000 
French soldiers will join the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Director Massart, who seems to be benefiting mainly from Chirac's friendship 
with Reagan, will have 3,500 extras, 300 fashion models, 100 accordionists and 
20 international stars, ranging from French crooner Charles Aznavour to Stevie 
Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the rival shows has problems. The Chirac spectacle will be rudely 
interrupted by a commercial for Citroen, the French car maker. And Massart's 
decision to install a "Noah's Ark" sequence in the middle of a historical 
theme, which begins with the French Revolution, has left American television 
director Walter C. Miller puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of this stuff I simply do not understand," said Miller, part of the 
American Radio City Music Hall team hired to hired to tape the show for 
international television. "We go from the French Revolution to Noah's Ark. It's 
just not chronological." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Tall for TV 
</P>
<P>
Another worry for Miller, a veteran of big spectacles who staged the 
inauguration of President Bush among other events, has to do with the tower 
itself. The 1,000-foot-high tower, constructed by French engineer Gustave 
Eiffel for the World's Fair of 1889, has a bad, as Miller put it in television 
terms "aspect ratio." In short, it is too tall for television. There is no way 
to show a performer and the tower at the same time. As a result, the performers 
will appear on the small screen as though they are set before a jungle-gym, not 
the whole magnificent iron-lace tribute to the dawn of the modern age. 
</P>
<P>
Goude, meanwhile, is beset by political problems. The Chinese portion of his 
"parade of planetary tribes" -- a giant drum pulled down the street by cyclists 
with dancers from the Beijing Opera and flailing martial artists, was canceled 
because of the recent political turmoil in China. Soviet officials objected to 
Goude's idea of having Kremlin guards goose-stepping down the street to African 
music while a ballerina danced with a bear. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens from Brittany refused to march in a Goude scene that they claimed made 
them look like comic strip characters. Their main objection appeared to be his 
proposal that they should wear traditional Brittany bigoudenes -- starched 
white head-dresses worn by women in the region -- but lit up with neon tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Parisians of all stripes are fed up with both political leaders for 
the inconvenience that their respective parties will cause drivers. For 
Chirac's fete tonight, a 6.2-square-mile area in the heart of Paris has been 
closed to all vehicular traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic restrictions will be even more severe for the Mitterrand Bicentennial 
events. Mitterrand has complicated his celebration by inviting the leaders of 
the world's other six richest industrial nations to hold their annual economic 
summit here. He also invited dozens of leaders from the world's poorest nations 
to meet with the rich nations' leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every leader will require a motorcade. Security will be intense. The 
Paris police chief has said he will mobilize 30,000 police, compared to only 
1,500 for the Chirac event. As a result, from July 10 to July 17, a huge 
section in the center of Paris, from the Bois de Boulogne in the west to the 
Louvre Museum in the east, will be closed to most traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Fumed Le Figaro, a Paris-based newspaper that supported Chirac and not 
Mitterrand in the presidential election last May: 
</P>
<P>
"Ten million Parisians and inhabitants of the suburbs are preparing to live a 
weeklong nightmare."
