   Barbara Bush, taking time out Thursday from the
festive French bicentennial celebration, inaugurated a wing at the
American Hospital with an extemporaneous speech _ an informal touch
recently adopted by the first couple.
   ``I had a long speech here but I learned something from my
husband,'' Mrs. Bush told the audience as she tore up her prepared
remarks. President Bush had done the same in Budapest on Tuesday as
a courtesy to the crowd standing in the rain.
   Mrs. Bush opened the new Florence Gould Pavilion and high-tech
medical center at the hospital, which is located in a posh Parisian
suburb.
   ``This is the most wonderful thing that's ever happened to me,''
she said. ``You've stretched my life a little bit. I'm on a
plaque.'' The plaque, which notes the inauguration, will be hung at
the hospital.
   The American Hospital, which Mrs. Bush toured for 30 minutes,
includes the new C.V. Starr International Center for Medical
Exchange, the first facility in Europe with a communications network
for teaching and diagnostics link directly to the United States.
   Before leaving the podium, Mrs. Bush bent down to shake the hands
of four children, out-patients at the facility, who presented her
with a silver cup and a spiral-notebook style cookbook written by
Americans living in Paris.
   Earlier, Mrs. Bush joined her husband and about 30 world leaders
at a reading of the Declarations of the Rights of Man, the 1789
document that set forth the French Revolution's aims of liberty,
equality and fraternity.
   The Bushes later took part in the presentation of the key to the
Bastille prison. The key, given to George Washington nearly 200
years ago by the Marquis de Lafayette, is on temporary loan to
France for the bicentennial celebration.
