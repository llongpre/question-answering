   Conductor Daniel Barenboim, fired as musical and
artistic director of the new Paris opera house in a scandal of
operatic dimensions, said today his dismissal should come from the
president of France.
   ``It is for him to choose between my presence and that of the
international artistic community I have gathered and the program of
the president of a couture house,'' Barenboim said at a news
conference.
   Pierre Berge, chairman of the board of the Opera-Bastille and
president of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, dismissed
Barenboim on Friday, saying he was demanding too much money.
   However, Barenboim said today he was not prepared to abandon his
duties.
   Berge, responding on French television, said he would not bring
the name of President Francois Mitterrand into the dispute because,
``it would become a political affair .... It is an affair of big
bucks.''
   Berge maintains Barenboim's 7-million franc ($1.1-million) annual
salary over four years is too much money for the four months a year
the 46-year-old Israeli conductor would spend in Paris. Berge says
the opera house made a counter-proposal of 4 million francs
($628,570) a year over two years, but that it was rejected.
   Barenboim's firing prompted threats from Patrice Chereau,
director of the Opera-Bastille's first production, to leave, and a
host of world-class performers _ including Pierre Boulez, Jessye
Norman, Herbert von Karajan and Sir Georg Solti _ sent a petition to
Culture Minister Jack Lang saying they might cancel their
performances.
   ``If Daniel Barenboim is not maintained as artistic and musical
director, we regret to inform you that the conditions of our
participation in this project are also subject to question,'' the
petition read.
   Boulez announced Sunday he would resign his post as vice
president of the Association of Theaters of the Opera of Paris,
headed by Berge, which helped to get the Opera-Bastille project off
the ground.
   ``I find (people) have acted in a completely inconsistent manner
and now there is the most total lunacy,'' he told Radio Monte Carlo.
   In an interview published Sunday in the Paris weekly Le Journal
du Dimanche, Berge said he was only 80 percent sure the opera house
could open Jan. 10, 1990 as scheduled.
   He contended the contract dispute is based on a preliminary
agreement signed in haste before the May elections that Chirac's
conservatives lost and claims the agreement gives Barenboim too much
power.
   ``The government of Jacques Chirac, totally opposed to the
Opera-Bastille, wanted to destroy it,'' Berge was quoted as saying,
``but finally decided to keep it and, in haste, put the cart before
the horse.''
   After the Socialist government of Premier Michel Rocard took
office, the opera house made a counterproposal to Barenboim of about
half the salary over two years, but it was rejected, Berge said.
   Barenboim has said the matter would be settled in court.
   Chereau, speaking on French television Sunday, said he would not
participate if Barenboim does not. Chereau is staging the opening
performance, Mozart's ``Don Giovanni,'' and is committed to two
other productions.
   The Opera-Bastille is a multimillion-dollar complex on the Place
de la Bastille, site of the prison whose storming launched the
French Revolution. The new opera house is meant to replace the
ornate Palais Garnier, best known as the Paris Opera, which will be
reserved for dance.
   Berge said the house, in keeping with its mission of bringing
opera to the people, should provide 220 performances a year, instead
of the 150 envisaged by Barenboim.
