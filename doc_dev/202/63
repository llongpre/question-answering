   Gamma Boo, a little-known star in the constellation
Bootes, has been thrust from obscurity and named the
``astrophysical symbol'' of the French Revolution bicentennial.
   Hundreds of people toasted the new twinkling symbol with
champagne at the Paris Observatory at sunset Wednesday and peered
into the gathering twilight to the northeast trying to make it out.
   Jean-Noel Jeanneney, head of the commission planning the
festivities marking the revolution's 200th birthday, said choosing
an official star showed the poetic side of the celebration.
   Gamma Boo, also known as Seginus, was chosen because it is the
brightest of several stars that are roughly 200 light-years from
earth. Light now reaching Earth would have left the star at about
the time Parisians were storming the Bastille prison in July 1789.
   To spot Gamma Boo, a skywatcher should locate the Big Dipper,
then follow the direction of the Dipper's handle another
handle-length away.
