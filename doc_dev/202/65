Conductor Daniel Barenboim has been fired as artistic director of the new Paris 
Opera de la Bastille after a salary dispute, but the new so-called "People's 
Opera" was plunged into deeper trouble Sunday when the man contracted to direct 
its first production resigned in sympathy with the sacked artistic director. 
Barenboim was dismissed when he refused to take a cut in his $1.1-million 
salary. The 46-year-old Argentine-born conductor and pianist also angered the 
new Socialist government with a program regarded as too highbrow for the Opera 
de la Bastille. Patrice Chereau, who had been scheduled to direct Mozart's Don 
Giovanni when the opera opens this summer, quit over the weekend and said that 
other international music figures may now refuse to work with the Opera. 
Chereau called Barenboim's firing by Pierre Berge, director of Paris's three 
opera houses and chairman of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house, 
"despicable." The new opera is built on the site of the Bastille prison, the 
battleground of the French revolution 200 years ago. The opera is scheduled to 
open on the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789.
