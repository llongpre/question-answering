   Cadets from the Virginia Military Institute, in gray
tunics and dark blue plumed hats, are giving the French a taste of
American marching music in this week's bicentennial festivities.
   The 45-member VMI band has been in France since July 6 to
represent the United States at several events marking the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution.
   On Saturday, the VMI cadets and other U.S. marching bands and
majorettes wowed a crowd of several thousand at Paris City Hall with
a display of jazzy music, fancy steps and spinning batons.
   French schools and universities have no marching bands, and the
brassy art is considered quintessentially American.
   The account in Sunday's editions of the weekly Paris newspaper Le
Journal du Dimanche noted that following the Montana Centennial Band
in cowboy hats and blue jeans ``were the ringing tones, a bit more
warlike, of the Virginia Military Institute, whose representatives
were sporting caps topped with blue plumes.''
   Also participating in Saturday's display at City Hall were bands
from James B. Dudley High School in Greensboro, N.C.; North Springs
(Ga.) High School and Lawrence Central (Ind.) High School.
   The most exotic touch came from the Touch of Kyle Twirling Club
of Kalamazoo, Mich. The Journal du Dimanche tried to explain ``le
twirling'' for its readers, describing it as ``manipulation of a
baton, involving at once juggling, acrobatics and dance.''
   Saturday's performance was part of a daylong U.S. salute to the
French bicentennial, which climaxes Friday on the 200th anniversary
of the storming of the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789.
   VMI was founded 150 years ago on the model of the Ecole
Polytechnique, the French military engineering academy _ established
during the revolution _ whose graduates still dominate top jobs in
French industry and technology.
   A tour of the Ecole Polytechnique was on the schedule for the
visiting cadets.
