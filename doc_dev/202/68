   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President
Francois Mitterrand appealed today for an immediate cease-fire in
Lebanon and an end to arms deliveries to Lebanese groups involved in
the conflict.
   In a statement after two days of talks, the leaders said they
supported attempts by the Arab League to settle the Lebanese civil
war but also said their countries were available to help with other
efforts to reach a peaceful settlement ``notably in the framework of
the United Nations Security Council.''
   France and the Soviet Union are among the five permanent members
of the Security Council.
   The statement said Gorbachev and Mitterrand ``are convinced that
Lebanon must remain sovereign, independent, united, with its
territorial integrity respected.''
   It said they ``called for an immediate cease-fire, rigorously
respected, as an indispensable condition for the establishment of a
constructive inter-Lebanese dialogue, aiming at national
reconciliation and peaceful building of a country founded on a
balance of the interests of all Lebanese communities.''
   The 14-year-old civil war in Lebanon, a former French possession,
has pitted Christians against Moslems and Druse militias. Since the
latest outbreak of fighting in March, Druse forces and Syrian troops
in Lebanon have battled the Christian army of Gen. Michel Aoun. Aoun
has demanded the withdrawal of the Syrians, in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate.
   The Soviet Union is the main arms supplier for Syria as well as
Iraq, which has been arming the Christian forces.
   The statement followed Gorbachev's meeting with French
intellectuals and students at the Sorbonne in which he challenged
them to help create a new, more peaceful world.
   Seated in a red velvet chair in the packed Sorbonne amphitheatre,
Gorbachev said the new Soviet political and economic system he is
fashioning would be ``a fusion of socialism and democracy.''
   ``It's more difficult than we thought at the beginning, but it's
working. The country is changing, rapidly and irriversibly,'' he
said, speaking through a translator to an audience of 2,000 that
included philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy and Regis Debray, a former
presidential adviser and author.
   Members of the Soviet delegation earlier this week said the visit
to the Sorbonne, the University of Paris founded in the 12th
century, would underline a new understanding between France and the
Soviet Union.
   For the last decade, French intellectuals, many of them former
leftists, have condemned communist totalitarian regimes since the
publication of Alexander Solzhenitsyn ``Gulag Archipelego.''
   Gorbachev called for protecting the global environment, halting
moral decline and for cooperation between ``men of culture, science
and art in France and the Soviet Union'' to solve the political and
social problems of the time.
   Gorbachev began the second day of his visit to France by laying a
wreath on the tomb of France's unknown soldier beneath the Arc de
Triomphe and paying a call on Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac.
   At a state dinner Tuesday, the first day of his three-day visit,
the Soviet president declared his readiness to defend human rights
and called for a united Europe, for moving beyond the East-West
schism that grew from the Cold War.
   ``The postwar period is over,'' Gorbachev said at the gala
dinner. ``Today, a way toward a stable peace is opening before us,
based not on a balance of forces, but on a balance of real and
correctly understood interests.''
   On Tuesday, the Soviet president met with Mitterrand and then
visited the Place de la Bastille, where 200 years ago this month an
angry mob stormed the prison and launched the French Revolution,
which swept away the French monarchy.
   In his dinner toast, Gorbachev said the Soviets feel like
participants in this month's festivities celebrating the French
Revolution's Bicentennial in part ``because perestroika, also, is a
revolution.''
   Perestroika, or restructuring, is the name given to Gorbachev's
4-year-old drive to revamp Soviet society and economy. In his
remarks, the 58-year-old leader noted that perestroika also includes
a keener understanding of the importance of human rights, long an
irritant in East-West relations.
   Since Gorbachev became Soviet leader in March 1985, he has
repudiated the vast apparatus of state terror put in place by
dictator Josef Stalin.
   He has also allowed wider expression of dissenting views,
including public challenges to the monopoly on power held by the
ruling Communist Party.
   He told Mitterrand that, like France, the Soviet Union is now
ready to defend the rights of ``individuals and entire nations.''
