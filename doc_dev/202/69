   Funerals for 14 people killed by an
emotionally troubled farmer who went on a rampage with a shotgun
will replace Bastille Day festivities in this small, close-knit
village, the mayor said today.
   Christian Dornier killed his mother and sister and wounded his
father Wednesday before getting in his car and driving around
shooting at everyone in his path, police said. The dead included
several children.
   Authorities said Dornier, who is about 30, wounded nine people,
including a police captain, and was himself shot and wounded before
being captured.
   Mayor Roger Clausse, whose 5-year-old niece was among those
killed, said Dornier was believed angered by his elderly father's
decision not to turn over to him management of the family farm in
Luxiol, which is near the Swiss border.
   He said funerals would be held Friday in this village of 128
people and the nearby communities of Baumes-les-Dames, Verne and
Voillans.
   Street dances and fireworks displays scheduled in
Baumes-les-Dames were canceled and will be replaced by a solemn
ceremony with placing of wreaths in memory of the victims.
   All over France, the traditional July 14 celebrations were to be
especially lively this year in honor of the 200th anniversary of the
storming of the Bastille prison in the French Revolution.
   A French anti-hunting group called for tighter controls on
firearms used by hunters, which are much easier to get than tightly
regulated handguns and other weapons. The Rally of Opponents to
Hunting issued a statement urging tougher laws on the possession of
hunting weapons that would ``take them away from people under
medical treatment and away from hunters out of season.''
   The mayor's son, Joel Clausse, said today that he was upstairs at
home when Dornier drove toward him shooting. He said he shot at
Dornier from an upstairs window with a rifle and wounded him, but
not badly enough to stop him.
   ``I saw the blood spurting out of his neck,'' Joel Clausse said.
Dornier then continued on until he was finally stopped by police
gunfire in the village of Autechaux, 1.5 miles from Luxiol, the
mayor's son said.
   The mayor said 40 officers had given chase.
   Police said Dornier had been working on his father's farm. Roger
Clausse said Dornier was known in the village to be emotionally
troubled.
   Archbishop Lucien Daloz from the nearby city of Besancon was
among the mourners who came to visit the makeshift chapel at City
Hall where the bodies of six of the victims were laid. Besides the
mayor's niece, a 10-year-old girl was also among the dead, police
said.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said a local police
spokesman, whom it did not identify, called Dornier ``a huge man,
solitary and wild, someone who inspires fear.''
   Police at their regional headquarters in Besancon said the 14
were killed by buckshot.
   Georges Dornier, the suspect's uncle, said in a telephone
interview Wednesday that his nephew was ``mildly depressive. I saw
him this morning, and he was very calm.''
   A neighbor of Dornier, Marie-Therese Barraud, said she hid behind
a wall as he fired shots into her kitchen. ``My husband, who was
outside, was shot in the legs and the head. He's in the hospital,''
she said by telephone.
   ``I knew he was sick, he had shot at my husband once before,''
Mrs. Barraud said of Dornier. ``Our neighbors advised us not to go
out in our garden.''
   A young woman reached by telephone in Luxiol said she heard
gunshots that she thought at first were firecrackers.
   ``Then a neighbor told me a black car was driving around the
village and the driver was shooting at everybody,'' she said on
condition of anonymity. ``I went to tell the mayor. I saw an old
woman lying on the ground dead.''
   Premier Michel Rocard sent a telegram to the mayor of Luxiol
offering condolences. The village is about 275 miles southeast of
Paris.
   The mass killing was the worst in memory for France. Death tolls
have been higher in similar recent attacks in the United States and
Britain.
   In San Ysidro, Calif., James Huberty shot and killed 21 people
and injured 19 others at a McDonald's restaurant on July 18, 1984.
   On Aug. 19, 1987, in Hungerford in southwestern England, Michael
Ryan killed 16 bystanders with an assault rifle and revolver before
he was killed.
   Under French gun-control regulations, a license is required to
buy a shotgun. Handguns and assault rifles, which are more tightly
controlled, are very rare in this country.
