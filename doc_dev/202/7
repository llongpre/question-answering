   Let them decorate cake in Chicago, storm the Bastille in
Louisiana, sprint while balancing bottles of sparkling water in
Boston: vive la revolution en Amerique.
   New York, home to an estimated 15,000 French citoyens, has been a
flurry of activity this year to celebrate the 200th anniversary of
the French revolution. There have been French films, an opera
written by philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, dance and music
concerts.
   The French consul general, Benoit d'Adoville, will be host of a
reception on Friday, the day the French celebrate the storming of
the Bastille, the prison that was a symbol of autocratic oppression.
   In California, the Sacramento Symphony is holding a champagne
dance Friday, followed two days later by the ``Le Tour de San
FRANCEcisco'' bike race. The French government estimates that 25,000
French expatriates live in the Bay area.
   Emmanuel Gagniarre, a French consulate spokesman in New York,
says he's at a loss to list all the U.S. events planned to
commemorate the French revolution.
   ``In the United States, there are so many things,'' he said.
``There are so many historic events and values linking the two
nations,'' he said.
   Gagniarre noted that the U.S. Bill of Rights was presented to
Congress in 1789, the year the French Declaration of the Rights of
Man and Citizen was promulgated. Thomas Jefferson was U.S. envoy to
France at the time.
   On Boston Common, a site important to the history of the American
Revolution, waiters carrying bottles of sparkling water will compete
in a Bastille Day footrace.
   New Orleans, ever proud of its French heritage, plans a two-mile
cross-country race. The first 100 finishers will be awarded a bottle
of wine.
   New Orleans also offers something for counterrevolutionaries: a
Napoleon and Josephine look-alike contest.
   The town of Kaplan, deep in French-speaking Louisiana, has had
Bastille Day celebrations since 1906, but ``it's special this year
because of the bicentennial,'' said Janet Merritt, chairwoman of
this year's July 13-16 fete. Activities in Kaplan include a
recreation of the storming of the Bastille.
   Eric Falt, a spokesman for the French consulate in Chicago, said
he saw the same sense of fraternity in France when the United States
celebrated its bicentennial.
   ``I think this year is very comparable to 1976,'' Falt said.
``I'm very surprised. I just moved here from France. And I'm very
happy about it.''
   Falt said he expects thousands of Chicagoans to attend a Bastille
Day street fair along Michigan Avenue. It is one of some 50 events
scheduled in the Chicago area this month, including a pastry contest
for children whimsically named ``Let Them Decorate Cake.''
   Not all the commemorations are so lighthearted. In Miami, the
Cuban Museum of Art and Culture plans an exhibit of photographs this
month on ``the first revolution for the rights of man.''
   ``All the revolutions in Latin America were influenced directly
by the American Revoluton and the ideas of the French philosphers of
the 18th and 19th centuries,'' said museum director Carlos Luis.
``We are celebrating 200 years of the ideas of freedom and
tolerance.''
