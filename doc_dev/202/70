The Palais Garnier is closed for refurbishment, and the Paris Opera Ballet
has moved for this season to the Bastille Opera. I think the Bastille a
wonderful house: habitues complain about the constant need to go up and down
stairs, but it is an airy, grand and welcoming place in which to see the
lyric arts, and magnificently planned for its public.
To mark the start of the ballet season in its new home, the first programme
 -Balanchine and Robbins choreographies - begins with a Grand Defile.
Impossible to reproduce that sense of infinity we know with a defile at the
Palais Garnier as the cohorts of school and company process from the
chandeliered and mirrored depths of the Foyer de la Danse - the line may not
stretch to the crack of doom, but it goes back, symbolically speaking,
to the age of Louis XIV, founder of this temple.
But Francoise Seguin has devised a setting which cleverly echoes the
Bastille's architecture to provide a comparable idea of a long tradition. A
curved perspective leads down a ramp on to the stage. There we first see a
petit rat, who takes a simple pose and leads on the girls from the school as
the march from Les Troyens rings out. There follow the female ranks of the
company, each led by an etoile, then the boys of the school, and the men of
the troupe, each grade led by a star.
Masses of applause, and splendidly stellar behaviour from the etoiles as
they reach the front of the stage at slightly hastened pace to greet their
adoring public with smiles and glances imperious or beguiling. It is
irresistible as spectacle, and how revealing about the pride of the dancers
and of the French public - and the French public purse - in the Opera as a
spiffing example of a nation's art. Would we could feel the same about our
national ballet, its funding and its popular image.
The parade over, we had the joys of two Balanchine works - Le Palais de
Cristal and Four Temperaments - and Jerome Robbins' Glass Pieces. Le Palais
de Cristal is the Opera's very own Balanchine, made in 1947 when the
choreographer was resident in Paris. It is known elsewhere as the white and
sparkling Bizet Symphony in C. But at its creation in Paris it had a highly
coloured and complex design by Leonor Fini, and was danced in a manner more
 -shall we say? - temperamental than we know nowadays with New York City
Ballet. (Its
original cast included
Tamara Toumanova in the adagio, Lycette Darsonval, Micheline Bardin,
Madeleine Lafon - each a vivid personality.)
Their example, the Fini costumes and the original Balanchine text, linger
on. At Tuesday night's opening of the season, Monique Loudieres gave a most
beguiling account of the second movement adagio, deploying the complete
ballerina battery of technique, personality and a femininity that coloured
every movement. It was an irresistible and enchanting performance, the
epitome of a particular charm and grace of manner. The piece looked very
good in this Parisian version. The succeeding Four Temperaments was no less
fine on the absolute and uncompromising terms of New York's Balanchine.
As if to prove her versatility, Mlle Loudieres danced the 'Sanguine' duet
with ideal clarity, well partnered by Jean-Yves Lormeau. Kader Belarbi as
Melancholic, Patrick Dupond as Phlegmatic, Carole Arbo as Choleric, caught
the style well. After nearly half a century, Four Temperaments still looked
inevitable and prophetic in this performance.
Robbins' Glass Pieces, which closed the bill, might have been made for the
Bastille stage. The graph-paper setting matches the house's architecture.
The mechanical crossing and re-crossing of the stage that start the piece
are matched by the crowds on the Place de la Bastille or in the Metro. It is
an oddly heartless and urgent work, and Robbins gives the driving
repetitions of Philip Glass' music a human intensity.
It is a ballet I admire rather than like, but the Opera cast are superb,
robot-like or - in the pas de deux well done by Marie-Claude Pietragalla and
Jean-Marie Didiere - hieratically moving. Vaut le voyage.
The Paris Opera Ballet repeats the programme on October 31, November 1,4,6
matinee, 8,10,12,15,18, at the Bastille.
