<HEAD>New, Lighter 10-Franc Coin Coming; New Franc Logo in September</HEAD>

   A two-toned 10-franc coin, a first in France, will
go into circulation in the coming days and eventually replace the
heavy coin now in use, the government announced Thursday.
   Finance Minister Edouard Balladur also introduced a new symbol
for the French franc, a capital ``F'' slashed with two bars, to be
adopted in September.
   The new coin with a nickel center encircled by a copper alloy
bears an engraving of the winged spirit of the Bastille that tops
an obelisk in the Place de la Bastille, commemorating next year's
bicentennial of the French Revolution. The reverse side is
inscribed with the coin's value.
   The coin is the second 10-franc piece to be issued in two years.
A small 10-franc coin distributed in 1986 was recalled because it
too closely resembled the 50-centime piece, leading to confusion.
   Ten francs currently is worth about $1.78.
   The new French franc symbol replaces the ``f'' currently used as
shorthand for the franc. The two slashes across the capital ``F''
mean the symbol stands for franc and French, Balladur said.
