   Rocketing 300 feet skyward in a plastic bubble
mounted on a flimsy tower of piping is not every world leader's idea
of a good time.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, reputed to suffer vertigo
at considerable heights, is taking another route to the cloud-bound
confines of the 15th World Economic Summit at La Grande Arche.
   The sessions on debt, development and East bloc aid bring the
world's most influential western statesmen to the upper slab of a
controversial structure that looks much like a deep, glassless
window frame.
   The rooftop summit site is a windowless, marble-encased concrete
cocoon that spans two trapezoidal office towers at a height of more
than 300 feet.
   Many have likened the Arche's exposed elevator shaft to
scaffolding, and two stands of metal-pipe artworks flanking the
structure's entrance also give the site a ``Men at Work'' motif.
   To picture the Arche, imagine a 35-story-high white cardboard box
standing on its side, with the top and bottom flaps folded in to
form a free-standing tunnel.
   The cavernous hollow below the summit site is large enough to
hold the Notre Dame cathedral, including its spire.
   Mulroney's spokesman, Gilbert Lavoie, declined comment on a Le
Monde newspaper report Friday that the Canadian prime minister would
forego the elevators because of a fear of heights.
   Lavoie said it was his understanding that all seven leaders
attending the summit would avoid the bubbles for security reasons,
and that Mulroney's attitude toward heights ``is a matter of his
private life.''
   Journalists who have accompanied Mulroney on other trips abroad,
however, report that the prime minister categorically rejects all
venues with exposed heights and even draws the curtains over windows
of his jet when flying.
   Contrary to the Canadian view, at least one of the leaders is
taking the scenic route.
   ``I can't imagine George Bush passing up anything adventurous,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater commented.

   They call it the ``class photo'' and its been a ritual since the
first economic summit 15 years ago.
   For this year's snapshot, French President Francois Mitterrand
selected the Pyramide du Louvre, the controversial glass structure
by I.M. Pei in front of the Louvre.
   Mitterrand greeted the leaders as they arrived and then escorted
them inside only to emerge a few minutes later.
   They stood side-by-side on a red carpet, first Jacques Delors,
president of the European Economic Community, then Italian Prime
Minister Ciriaco de Mita, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bush,
Mitterrand, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Mulroney and
Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.

   The economic summit meeting is being overshadowed by a lavish
celebration of the 200th anniversary of the storming of the
Bastille, a focal point of the French Revolution.
   But U.S. officials say they are too busy worrying about debt and
other financial issues to be distracted.
   ``I can only tell you that I am impressed with the quality of the
discussion and the intentions of the leaders,'' Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady said.
   The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, also
disclaimed any distraction from the business at hand, despite the
parades, fireworks and extravagent displays.
   He said that celebrating Bastille Day annually was ``just as
important to the people of France as the Independence Day is to the
people of America.''
   Fitzwater added: ``We respect this and think it adds immensely to
the summit.''
