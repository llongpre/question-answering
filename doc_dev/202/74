   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, beset at home by ethnic strife
and economic woes, today began an official visit to France that one
top aide hinted could be the occasion for another dramatic Kremlin
disarmament proposal.
   ``You know that Mr. Gorbachev never comes empty-handed,'' Vadim
Zagladin, a member of the Soviet Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee, told reporters on the eve of the Soviet
president's arrival in Paris.
   The 58-year-old Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, left their special
Ilyushin-62 jetliner at Paris' Orly Airport with broad smiles on
their faces. They were greeted by Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand and his wife, Danielle.
   ``Everyone in France is interested in you personally and in your
actions,'' Mitterrand told Gorbachev and his wife, who was dressed
in a stylish green suit and black blouse.
   Both leaders said they would seek to deepen French-Soviet
relations during Gorbachev's stay. ``The Soviet people highly value
our ties of friendship and cooperation,'' Gorbachev told Mitterrand.
   The Mitterrands were to play host to the Gorbachevs at an
official luncheon held at the Elysee, the French presidential
palace, and then the two heads of state were to begin about 15 hours
of talks.
   During his three-day visit, his second to France as Soviet
leader, Gorbachev is also to meet with Premier Michel Rocard and the
secretary general of the French Communist Party, Georges Marchais.
   He will also preside over the signing of 21 bilateral accords on
topics ranging from cooperation in space to creation of a
Soviet-based joint venture to build high-definition television sets.
   Both Gorbachevs also planned to greet Parisians at the Place de
la Bastille, a square in eastern Paris where 200 years ago this
month, a mob stormed a royal prison, liberated the inmates and
massacred the warden.
   That assault, on July 14, 1789, is celebrated as the debut of the
French revolution. Marxist-Leninist doctrine considers the French
revolution as an event in the history of world class struggle on a
par with the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that brought the Communists
to power in Russia.
   Gorbachev has often used his foreign trips to announce unilateral
Soviet disarmament measures or Kremlin arms reduction proposals.
   On his first visit to France, in October 1985, he called for both
superpowers to slash their nuclear arsenals by 50 percent, an idea
currently being negotiated by Americans and Soviets in Geneva.
   At the time, Gorbachev invited France and Britain to begin direct
discussions with the Soviets on their nuclear forces.
   Mitterrand refused, and the French have since said the United
States and Soviet Union must cut their far larger nuclear arsenals
before the French contemplate reductions in their nuclear force.
   Gorbachev, who has proposed a negotiated end to all nuclear arms
by the year 2000, is now ready to heed that reasoning, but he still
seeks France's commitment to eventual nuclear weapons cuts, Soviet
official Andrei Grachev said Monday.
   Grachev, deputy chief of the Soviet Communist Party Central
Committee's International Department, told the French radio network
France-Inter in an interview:
   ``Mr. Gorbachev can accept the French argument according to which
France awaits serious reductions (by the superpowers) to begin its
involvement in the disarmament process, while expecting France to
finally join us.''
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said pointedly Monday
that ``the overarmed powers must first disarm, and then ... we can
talk.''
   Neither the French nor the Soviets expect the popular fervor for
the Soviet leader in France that he encountered on his last trip to
a Western country, West Germany, on June 12-15.
   French Moscow-watcher Michel Tatu wrote in the daily Le Monde
that the French, for one thing, are much more pessimistic about the
chances for success of Gorbachev's ambitious reform campaign.
   Gorbachev flew to France with Soviet food supplies at their most
meager in recent memory and with discontent rising over the lack of
visible results from his drive for perestroika, or economic and
social restructuring.
   Explosions of ethnic strife also have occurred, most recently in
the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
   On Saturday, Gorbachev made a nationally televised appeal for
calm.
   He is to travel to Strasbourg in northeastern France on Thursday,
the final day of his visit, to address the Council of Europe, an
assembly of 23 Western European democracies founded to promote
European cooperation.
   Gorbachev is then to fly to Bucharest, Romania, for the annual
summit of the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-led military alliance in
Eastern Europe.
