   Through a pair of lunches and a dinner, an opera and
a parade, leaders of two dozen poor nations rubbed elbows and
clinked glasses with the heads of the seven wealthiest democracies.
But France's bicentennial ball ended Friday and the poorer relations
turned back into pumpkins.
   It was all the doing of French President Francois Mitterrand, who
scheduled the 15th annual economic summit of industrialized nations
to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   For a day and a half, the seven summiteers mingled with the other
world leaders who had been invited to the bicentennial festivities.
But the summit officially opened Friday, and Friday's dinner was for
members only.
   While Mitterrand hosted and toasted his rich counterparts,
France's other guests were shunted off to be entertained by Premier
Michel Rocard and the president's wife, Danielle.
   The logistical necessity of veering the ``Big Seven'' from the
bicentennial festivities and into the economic summit caused no
little embarrassment for Mitterrand and his government. There seemed
no way to do it without appearing to be handing out second-class
tickets to the little guys.
   Mitterrand _ the ``advocate of the poor,'' as his aides repeat
ceaselessly _ counts among his guests for the bicentennial party
some of the planet's most economically strapped countries, such as
Bangladesh, and the most deeply indebted, such as Brazil and Mexico.
   Some of the summit participants, including the United States,
Britain and West Germany, were adamantly opposed to mixing the two
events to the point where the economic summit became a major
North-South event.
   Though debt will be one of the main topic of the summit, the
richer countries want to keep to the original economic summit
framework created by former French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing in 1975.
   The summits have grown considerably beyond the informal economic
chats Giscard envisaged for that first event at Rambouillet. But the
principal task remains keeping the world's seven locomotive
economies perking along in good order, and in turn helping the less
healthy.
   Nonetheless, the proximity of the North-South leaders afforded a
golden opportunity for sleeve-tugging by the poor and
largess-dispensing by the rich.
   ``We have not tried to organize a North-South summit,'' said
Jacques Attali, special counsellor to Mitterrand and the main
organizer of the summit. ``On the other hand, on July 12, 13 and 14
there will be North-South meetings at the summit level.''
   In the framework of the bicentennial celebrations, the summit
participants and the leaders of the small nations attended a lavish
lunch together on Thursday, dined as a group in the evening and at
lunch again Friday.
   They sat side-by-side at the opening of the new Bastille Opera
House on Thursday and again at Friday's military parade, where
George Bush, leader of the world's wealthiest nation, had a seat in
the reviewing stand next to Hossain Mohammed Ershad, the president
of Bangladesh.
   ``They will be all together,'' Attali repeated again and again at
pre-summit press briefings. ``They will participate in all the
ceremonies together. They will have numerous bilaterial meetings.''
   That is, until the summit began.
   Enter the dinner flap.
   Originally, the summit participants were to have their first meal
alone at the French Admiralty with the other bicentennial guests
dining at the Crillon Hotel on Place de la Concorde. As
embarrassment mounted, however, the plans were changed and both
dinners were scheduled for the Admiralty _ but in different rooms.
   The menu for both groups was the same _ terrine of lamb, fried
sea perch, cheese, bread and olives. Dessert was bitter chocolate
shells filled with ice cream sweetened with lavender honey. The wine
was Chateau-Rayas 1945.
   The respected Paris newspaper Le Monde said the change came on
the personal order of Mitterrand, who was trying to smooth any
feathers that might be ruffled between lunch and dinner.
