   Visitors this week found the fabled city partly good
old Gay Paree primping for a binge and partly a capital under arms,
stunned by sudden occupation.
   Below the surface, frenzied officials faced last-minute crises.
   Organizers of the giant Friday night parade hired sharpshooters
with tranquilizer guns in case the elephants decided to moonwalk
down the Champs-Elysees with the Florida A&amp;M Marching Band.
   It was not immediately clear how fast a tranquilizer dart worked.
Or what one did with an inert elephant in the middle of a parade.
   Authorities had planned a temporary ban of alcohol along the
Champs Elysees, fearing rowdiness from crowds milling around with
liquid components of their moveable feast.
   Faced with violent objection, however, they backed down. One
columnist observed: ``Do they think anyone would have stormed the
Bastille without wine?''

   Most Frenchmen left in town seemed to be wearing uniforms and
sidearms, herding polyglot legions behind endless metal barriers
that lent an ominous tone to bright blue, white and red bunting.
   There was plenty to see, and eat, while waiting for the world's
biggest party to materialize as promised. But getting there was
decidedly not half the fun.
   Following signs to Tuileries 89, featuring a computer-art replica
of a 1789 Paris street and an android variety show, two visitors
were stopped by guards.
   ``You can't go in there,'' said one, ``It's closed for July 14
celebrations.''
   But, the visitors said, that was why everyone was in Paris.
   ``Look,'' the guard said, ``We got missiles, anti-missile
missiles, fireworks. How do you expect us to let the public in
here?''
   The visitors eventually found the right way in.

   In the gardens outside, an aging, elegant lady followed her
poodle in aimless circles. Each had a bewildered expression. ``Can
you help me out of here?'' she asked a stranger, seeking guidance in
a neighborhood she had inhabited for 40 years.
   ``This is insanity, a disgrace,'' she said, identifying herself
only as Odette. ``You can't go anywhere. I have friends who got a
pass that allows them to leave their house, but they have no pass to
come home at night.''
   She referred to draconian parking and driving regulations that
have sealed the center of Paris. Later, a taxi driver named Roland
was asked if he would be working the long weekend.
   ``Are you crazy?'' he replied, smacking his left forearm in a
French gesture depicting a rapid escape. ``I'm getting out of here.''

   For a privileged few, Paris has never been easier.
   The trick is a series of passes, invitations and credentials, the
issuing of which would have thrown King Louis XVI's protocol staff
into cold sweat.
   Cars move swiftly down freshly swept boulevards, ablaze in the
color of hyacinths and roses and giant tricolors tied in bows,
unless any of 33 visiting presidents or prime ministers happens by.
   Near the Grand Palais, police waved on two tourists who ambled
peaceably across the broad road. Suddenly, an officer yelled:
``Move!''
   The tourists leaped sideways just as roaring motorcycles and a
stretch Peugeot flying a Cameroon flag careered around the corner at
breakneck speed, missing them by inches.
   On the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, the elegant street on which
the Elysee Palace is situated, police shoved Parisians back into
their shops when several visitors' motorcades flashed past.
   ``I thought this was our city,'' one muttered.
   If conspicuous, the security was not necessarily effective. One
journalist, testing it out, walked through a sealed-off area with a
hunting rifle in a scabbard.

   All over town, people caught up on their rest wherever they
could. At the Tuileries, a disheveled couple lay sprawled under a
statue, an upended champagne bottle by their bare feet.
   They were in stark contrast to the dapper stone figure towering
over them, Jules Ferry, the 19th century premier who set France on a
``civilizing mission'' to bring couth to a savage world.
   Souvenir shops did a brisk trade in revolutionary lingerie, funny
hats and condoms imprinted with a guillotine.
   Overall, officials said, the festivities were expected to attract
$160 million to Paris, but merchants weren't convinced.
   ``This is a T-shirt crowd,'' sniffed Patrice, a salesman in a
downtown gallery where Italian jackets start at $600. ``These are
not spenders, believe me.''

   The newspapers held fascinating tidbits. One noted that security
teams for visiting leaders had to negotiate the firearms they were
allowed, based on a strict quid pro quo.
   The Japanese were not permitted any. When President Francois
Mitterrand attended Emperor Hirohito's funeral, his security guard
was stripped of weapons, as were all others.
   The International Herald Tribune reprinted an item from 100 years
ago: ``The present week is being filled up to overflowing with
official and social events.'' There was a state dinner for officers
of the Paris garrison and a commemorative fete for Camille
Desmoulins ``of Revolutionary fame'' during which participants would
wear horse chestnut leaves and tricolor cockades.
   July 14th ``will be celebrated in a way that it is hoped will
surpass all past events of a similar kind that this gay capital has
ever witnessed,'' it concluded.
   This year's organizers said the same thing, and they may be
right. But 1879 festivities included a world's fair that left Paris
with the Eiffel Tower, a tough act to follow.
