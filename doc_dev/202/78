   Mayor Jacques Chirac has rejected plans for an
anti-aircraft battery to protect visiting leaders during
bicentennial celebrations, although the City of Light will be
sprouting submachine guns and missiles.
   The display of firepower is piquing the people celebrating 200
years of liberty, equality and fraternity.
   Critics say the security dragnet _ to be enforced during a
meeting of the world's seven richest countries at the same time _
might be better suited for kings.
   ``The Bicentennial of the Rich,'' said the Communist Party
newspaper L'Humanite in a headline this week.
   The elaborate arrangements all but ignore 30 other heads of state
from Latin America, Africa and Asia, so a group including French pop
singer Renaud is organizing a ``countersummit of the poor'' on July
8.
   ``Any resemblance between the commemoration of the bicentennial
of the French Revolution and a great popular celebration is becoming
more remote each day,'' the conservative tabloid Le Quotidien de
Paris said this week, following the disclosure of a plan to install
double-barreled 20mm guns on a bridge over the Seine.
   ``Two centuries ago, the Paris mob freed the last prisoners from
the Bastille. On July 14, the descendants of this same crowd will be
under lock and key,'' the newspaper said.
   Chirac urged the Defense Ministry to find someplace else for the
anti-aircraft battery. Mirage jetfighters and Crotale missiles still
will back up more than 30,000 policemen and soldiers on patrol from
July 12-17, according to air force spokesman Col. Serge Lenne.
   Under the security plan, parts of central Paris will be closed to
most vehicles. The Louvre Museum is to be closed for three days, and
tourist boats forbidden to ply the Seine.
   Six radar systems will be added to the four permanently installed
around Paris, infra-red cameras for night viewing will be mounted on
high altitude sites and a dirigible will float in the city sky.
   ``We all know that power makes you mad,'' opposition politician
Jacques Toubon said in a jab at Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand. Toubon is mayor of the 13th district where the Tolbiac
Bridge is located.
   Gen. Yves Aubert's plan to turn the Tolbiac Bridge into a
military zone for a week beginning July 10 was aimed at deterring
any hostile planes penetrating the city via the Seine, Lenne said.
   ``The air force is currently looking for another site,'' Lenne
said, adding it would likely be inside Paris.
   The security arrangements have produced tongue-in-cheek jibes.
   ``Maybe I'm not a chief of state of one of the richest countries
in the world,'' wrote Le Monde satirist Claude Sarraute, ``but I'm
the head of a developing family and I was fearing for my security''
with all the fighting in subway stations and ``deadly words received
in the middle of a traffic jam.''
   The Paris Greens, an environmentalist party, on Wednesday asked
Defense Minister Pierre Chevenement to take measures ``dignified of
the nation: a nuclear submarine under the Alma Bridge, Pluton
missiles at the Ile de la Cite and fighter planes in Montmartre.''
