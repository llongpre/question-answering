   France showed off the nation's military strength in
a Bastille Day parade Saturday, and President Francois Mitterrand
pledged to keep the nation's nuclear force independent and strong.
   Later in the day, flamboyant showman Jean-Michel Jarre lit up
western Paris before more than 2 million people in a spectacular
music and light show.
   Earlier, 7,000 servicemen trooped down the Champs-Elysee to
celebrate the start of the French Revolution.
   In his remarks, Mitterrand told television journalists,
``Defense is part of the imperial obligations of the nation.''
   ``I absolutely don't want to reduce it,'' he said, ``even more
so because there hasn't been a real reduction in the nuclear
potential of the United States or the Soviet Union.''
   France refuses to endorse the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's recent change of doctrine making nuclear weapons a
``last resort'' in any conflict with the Warsaw Pact. French
officials have said flexibility is a key to nuclear deterrence.
   ``The international situation has changed, tensions have
diminished. The duty of vigilance by the army, however, hasn't
diminished,'' Mitterrand said.
   July 14 marks the fall of the Bastille prison in 1789. The event
sparked the French revolution that toppled Louis XVI and gave
France its first republican government.
   The daylong festivities were capped by Jarre's extravaganza.
   During his show, the year-old Grande Arche and adjacent
skyscrapers in the financial district of La Defense were bathed in
dazzling, swirling colors. They changed in rhythm to Jarre's
symphonic rock music, while searchlights and fireworks formed a
canopy overhead.
   People packed the banks of the Seine on the capital's western
edge and a two-mile stretch of avenue to the Arc de Triomphe.
   The crowd was estimated at 1.5 million before the concert began,
but hundreds of thousands more people, from toddlers to nuns, kept
filling distant streets as it started. Many were unable to get a
direct view, but video screens were set up as well.
   The Culture Ministry underwrote the show with $8.18 million to
allow Jarre to put it on for free.
   ``I want a celebration for the people _ open and free to
everybody,'' said Jarre.
   The morning parade featured 7,000 soldiers, sailors,
firefighters and police officers marching from the Arc de Triomphe
to the Place de la Concorde to salute Mitterrand.
   A trio of aerobatic jets led off the parade, laying down blue,
white and red contrails over the route to match the colors of the
huge tricolor fluttering under the Arc de Triomphe.
   About 600 tanks and other armored vehicles lined the avenue or
paraded noisily along the three-quarter mile route. The vehicles
represent about 15 percent of France's armored forces.
   The loudest applause was reserved for the bearded companies of
Foreign Legionnaires, dressed in desert khakis and their trademark
white kepis.
   The Napoleonic-uniformed Republican Guards, who provide
ceremonial security at the presidential palace, also drew cheers as
they trotted down the Champs-Elysees on cavalry horses, flashing
their gleaming chrome sabers.
   Also featured were state-of-the-art Mistral ground-to-air
missiles, capable of reaching speeds of 1,864 mph to knock down
enemy aircraft.
   A platoon of World War II-era tanks, similar to those that
liberated Paris from the Nazi occupation 50 years ago, also were on
display. One bore the name De Gaulle, in tribute to wartime leader
Gen. Charles de Gaulle. France is celebrating the 100th anniversary
of his birth this year.
