   Authorities are using a zeppelin for surveillance
when about 30 foreign leaders visit Paris for the 200th anniversary
of the French Revolution.
   The 200-foot-long dirigible, estimated to cost $7 million, relays
live television coverage from its two cameras simultaneously to
several command centers on the ground.
   The aircraft went into service last week for the visit of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and was displayed Sunday for
reporters at Le Bourget airport north of Paris.
   It will be used for the celebrations of Bastille Day on July 14,
the simultaneous summit of the world's seven richest countries, and
the July 23 arrival of the Tour de France bicycle race in Paris.
   Designed by the British firm Airship Industries, its envelope is
manufactured in France, its 38-foot-long cabin in Britain, and its
engines are made by Porsche of Germany.
   The cabin has room for a 10-man crew. Fourteen such airships have
been built. They were used for security at the Olympic Games in Los
Angeles and Seoul and for the funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
