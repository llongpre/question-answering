   Thousands of native Chinese marched together in Hong Kong,
Paris, Tokyo and scores of other cities Sunday in a worldwide show
of solidarity with their besieged brethren in Beijing.
   President Bush likened the protests in China to the civil rights
marches led by Martin Luther King, and the Nationalist Chinese
government in Taiwan condemned the actions of the rival communist
regime on the mainland.
   The demonstrations came as hundreds of thousands of people in
Beijing defied martial law for a second day in a row and swarmed
through the city demanding democratic reforms. The army was
reportedly poised for a crackdown.
   In Hong Kong, a British colony scheduled to revert to Chinese
rule in 1997, an estimated 400,000 people virtually paralyzed the
city during a peaceful march in support of the Beijing protesters.
   Media were generally supportive. Even the staff of the Xinhua
News Agency, the unofficial representative of China in Hong Kong,
wrote a banner to support the marchers.
   The crowd marched for three hours, then entered a race track and
listened to speeches by community leaders, movie stars and
lawmakers.
   In the United States, Chinese students said in an open telegram
that they no longer recognize the government led by Premier Li Peng.
   ``We 10,000 Chinese students in New York City and the East Coast
of the United States are on the side of the Chinese people,'' the
telegram said.
   ``We no longer recognize the Chinese government led by Li Peng
as a legal administration in China, and we pledge our complete
disobedience to such a hostile government towards the whole Chinese
nation.''
   About 300 students attended a demonstration at the Chinese
consulate in New York. Three students met with officials of the
Chinese consulate in New York and delivered the telegram.
   Other rallies were held in Lawrence, Kan; Houston and Washington
D.C.
   Taiwan's Nationalist government condemned the communist Chinese
government for ordering military troops to crack down on the
student-led protests. It said it may take ``effective measures'' to
support the pro-democracy movement.
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming refused to say what that might
include, because ``we don't want to offer the mainland any excuse
to take retaliatory action against the students.''
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 when they lost a
civil war in China, continue to claim they are the legitimate
government of all China. The Nationalists and Communist Chinese are
technically still at war.
   About 100 Taiwanese demonstrated in the capital, Taipei, to
support the Chinese protesters.
   In Tokyo, thousands of Chinese studying in Japan rallied and
marched downtown.
   Spokesman Yang Zhao said 4,500 people joined in the gathering
organized by the Solidarity Union of Chinese Students in Japan.
Police estimated the number at 2,000.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said Chinese students also marched
in Osaka, Nagoya, Tsukuba and other cities.
   About 1,000 Chinese students demonstrated Sunday in Paris,
carrying banners in French and Chinese with slogans such as
``Brothers and sisters we love you, old dictators we hate you,''
and ``1789 Liberty for the French, 1989 Democracy for the Chinese;
Bastille Equals Tiananmen.''
   France is celebrating the bicentennial of its revolution this
year, with festivities climaxing on July 14, the anniversary of the
storming of the Bastille prison.
   Bush called on Chinese authorities Sunday to show restraint in
dealing with the pro-democracy demonstrations, urging officials to
be ``as forthcoming as possible in order to see more
democratization, and to see a peaceful resolution.''
   ``I do not want to see bloodshed,'' he told reporters. ``We
revere the model of Martin Luther King in this country for his
peaceful protest,'' Bush said.
   The remarks were his first detailed comments on the situation.
