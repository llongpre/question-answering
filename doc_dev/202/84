   Next year's summit of the seven most powerful
democracies will feature a new U.S. president on the world stage
and a backdrop of fireworks marking the bicentennial of the French
Revolution.
   The meeting may also show whether Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand of France, who will become the first leader ever to
repeat as summit host, can shift the theme of the gathering away
from the free-market philosophy so dear to President Reagan and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Reagan will be gone _ replaced most likely by George Bush or
Michael Dukakis _ but most of the other leaders who finished their
three-day meeting Tuesday in Canada's largest city probably will be
on hand again next year.
   Reagan's retirement is sure to shine the spotlight all the more
brightly on Mrs. Thatcher, a vigorous proponent of the policy that
less government is good government.
   Like Mrs. Thatcher and Mitterrand, West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has won re-election in the past 18 months and can expect to be
in office next year. Prime Ministers Noboru Takeshita of Japan and
Ciriaco De Mita of Italy are new in office, but the Italian cannot
count on staying around long enough to see his second summit.
   The leader in the shakiest position is this year's host,
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose Progressive
Conservative party is trailing well behind the opposition Liberals
in public opinion polls with an election expected within the next
year.
   But Mitterrand may well be the only Socialist in the next group,
as he was this year. His views, eccentric in a group of free-market
conservatives, brought him into repeated clashes with Reagan over
contents of the final communique.
   The host leader has a strong role in shaping the summit agenda,
and the 71-year-old Mitterrand is known as a wily strategist. But
he will have a difficult task if he wants to stamp the meeting with
his leftist policies.
   He told a news conference on Tuesday that he was sure that farm
subsidies and Third World debt _ the two biggest issues at the
Toronto summit _ will still be major items for the leaders to
attack next year.
   When Mitterrand convenes the economic summit on July 14, 1989,
France will be marking exactly 200 years since a Parisian throng
stormed the Bastille prison, launching the French Revolution and _
in a sense _ the modern era.
   Preparing the bicentennial was one of Mitterrand's priorities in
his first term, and his re-election last month to another seven
years in office assures that he will be able to preside over the
fireworks displays, concerts and other events planned for the
occasion.
   Mitterrand said Tuesday that it was fitting that the seven
leaders would be on hand ``for the celebration of one of the great
events of our history, which is also theirs.''
   He said the date chosen for the summit ``will have an undeniable
symbolic force.''
   Next year's meeting will start a third ``cycle,'' now that each
of the seven countries has been host twice since the summits
started in 1975, when President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France
invited his peers to the Renaissance chateau at Rambouillet.
   When Mitterrand started the second cycle in 1982, he chose
another grand palace _ the chateau of Louis XIV at Versailles _ but
officials said next year's site would more likely be a modern
office complex in Paris.
   In their closing statement Tuesday, the leaders said their
meetings ``have helped to sustain the values of democracy that
underlie our economic and political system,'' and were worth
continuing for the next seven years, ending with another meeting in
Canada in 1995.
   ``We believe that the mutual understanding engendered in our
meetings has benefited both our own countries and the wider world
community,'' they said.
