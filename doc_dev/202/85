   President Bush met Tuesday with French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas to discuss various issues and next month's
visit to the United States by President Francois Mitterrand of
France.
   Bush told Dumas that he looked forward to visiting Paris for the
annual seven-nation economic summit, which will coincide with the
French celebration on July 14 of Bastille Day marking the
destruction of the prison in Paris during the French Revolution.
   Talking to reporters in the White House driveway following his
half-hour meeting with Bush in the Oval Office, Dumas said ``it was
a very warm and very interesting conversation that we had.''
   He did not get into specifics other than to say that he and Bush
discussed the Middle East, particularly the contininuing violence
in Lebanon, along with East-West relations and Central America.
   Dumas said he and Bush talked about the agenda for the talks
that the president will have with Mitterrand May 19 at Bush's
vacation retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   A French official, declining to be named publicly, said that
Dumas and other French leaders are seeking the support of the
United States and other countries to ship humanitarian aid to
Lebanon. He said the French hope that this subject can be discussed
in the U.N. Security Council.
