Yet another drama has unfolded at the scandal-scarred Opera Bastille in
Paris with the dismissal yesterday of Mr Myung Whun Chung, the acclaimed
South Korean conductor, as its artistic director only a month before the
start of its new season.
Mr Chung won praise at the Bastille for productions such as Shostakovitch's
Macbeth. However, his tenure in Paris has been clouded by the
highly-publicised problems of the Bastille.
It has been well attended but plagued by strikes and financial difficulties
since its glittering opening by President Francois Mitterrand as a
state-of-the-art 'people's opera' on the 200th anniversary of the 1789
French revolution.
The departure of Mr Chung, 41, who joined the Bastille five years ago
following the firing of Mr Daniel Barenboim, ends weeks of wrangling between
him and the Paris Opera's new management team led by Mr Hugues Gall. Mr Gall
is a former bureaucrat who was appointed director-designate last summer
after the election victory of Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right government.
The battle between the two men came out into the open on Thursday when Le
Monde newspaper published an interview with Mr Chung.
The conductor claimed that the new management was trying to curb his
artistic freedom. Although Mr Chung said he would be willing to make 'a
significant financial sacrifice' to stay at the Bastille, he made it quite
clear that he was not willing to relinquish his power over the choice of
productions or artistes.
However, Mr Gall has made no secret of his intention to exercise full
authority over every aspect of the Paris Opera's activities.
The Opera yesterday issued a formal statement saying that it had terminated
Mr Chung's employment because he had rejected all its proposals to shorten
his contract.
