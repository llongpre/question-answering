   Most Bastille Day-related events honored the
French Revolution, but at a funeral Mass in Manhattan for Louis XVI,
Marie Antoinette and other victims, celebrants deplored it.
   Instead of the Marseillaise, a Gregorian chant was heard Saturday
at St. Ann's Church, where 125 people prayed for the repose of the
souls of aristocrats and clerics.
   ``Let us pray to God that there will never be another French
Revolution,'' said the Rev. Karl A. Claver, who dwelt in his sermon
on the revolutionaries' ``fundamental and violent hostility towards
the Catholic Church,'' shown by the killing of Paris' archbishop,
the guillotining of nuns, the closing of churches and the
persecution of priests who refused to swear loyalty to the
revolutionary government.
   And he told the worshippers, some of whom called themselves
monarchists, that the French Revolution ushered in such dangerous
practices as ``civil marriage, secularized education and the
separation of church and state.''
   The memorial for the revolution's victims was held instead of the
traditional Latin Mass which is said every Saturday at St. Ann's.
   ``Out of all the voices extolling the virtues of the French
Revolution, there should be that Catholic voice saying, yes, there
may have been valuable things accomplished, but let's look at the
atrocities,'' said one of the Mass organizers, Joseph Patalano, 22,
a technical writer for Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   At least one of the organizers saw a direct link between the
French Revolution and the Latin Mass.
   ``We're here trying to preserve a tradition that many people in
the church are trying to suppress,'' said John Zmirak, a graduate
student at Louisiana State University.
   ``Modern secular ideology was born in bloodshed rather than in a
bloodless plebiscite,'' Zmirak said, declaring it ``a truth that the
culture is trying to suppress.''
