</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This bicentennial year of the French Revolution may be the most fitting time to 
visit Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson, who witnessed the beginnings of the Revolution, spent only a few 
years in Paris, but France had a profound influence on his taste ever after. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a love affair in Paris may have contributed to the feature most 
associated with Monticello -- the wondrous dome that overlooks the verdant 
hills of central Virginia. It was the first dome erected over a private home in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
In 1786, Jefferson, then the American minister (or ambassador) in Paris, met 
Maria Cosway, a 27-year-old English-born, Italian-educated painter, at the 
Halle aux Bleds, the new and expansive grain market in central Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Its enormous dome was the architectural delight of the city. But Jefferson, a 
43-year-old widower, seemed at that time less interested in the dome than his 
new friend, whom he described later as "the most superb thing on earth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maria Went Home 
</P>
<P>
Biographers do not agree whether the friendship flamed into a love affair, but 
if so, it did not last very long. Maria returned to London with her husband 
after six weeks, then made another visit to Paris in 1787 for three months, but 
did not see Jefferson very often that time. 
</P>
<P>
Historians believe it significant that Jefferson, when he rebuilt Monticello 
after his return to the United States, modeled some aspects of the dome after 
the Halle aux Bleds. 
</P>
<P>
"Jefferson, in tearing down and rebuilding Monticello after the pattern of the 
place where he first met Maria Cosway," wrote Fawn M. Brodie, one of his 
biographers, "may have been unconsciously defining and redefining the ideal 
woman, which he had clearly not yet found in his own life." 
</P>
<P>
Monticello, a glorious legacy of early America, stands on an 867-foot hill a 
few miles east of Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, which 
Jefferson founded and designed. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists are always fascinated by the home, for its crannies and gadgets and 
art and design reflect all of Jefferson's intelligence and sensibility and 
attention to detail. It is an idyllic monument to the voracious curiosity and 
sweeping knowledge of a remarkable statesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minister to France 
</P>
<P>
But visitors do not always understand the French influence fully. Jefferson 
represented the Continental Congress as minister to France from 1784 to 1789, 
during the transitional period between the end of the Revolution and the 
adoption of the Constitution. It was the only time in his life that Jefferson 
spent any time outside North America, and the future President was clearly 
enthralled by France and the French. 
</P>
<P>
"A more benevolent people I have never known," he wrote years later. "Nor 
greater warmth and devotedness in their select friendships. Their kindness and 
accommodation to strangers is unparalleled." 
</P>
<P>
French liberal friends like the Marquis de Lafayette tried to draw Jefferson 
into their politics of reform, for he was known throughout France as the author 
of the American Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jefferson resisted taking part, he did commute to Versailles 
frequently to hear the debates in the new National Assembly that was 
challenging the authority of King Louis XVI. He witnessed some of the major 
moments of the French Revolution, and heard firsthand accounts on the same day 
of other events, like the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson left Paris in late 1789, expecting to return, but soon accepted an 
appointment by President George Washington as the first secretary of state in 
the new American government under the Constitution. He never returned to 
France. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built in Two Phases 
</P>
<P>
Monticello was built in two phases. Although it was still unfinished when 
Jefferson left for France in 1784, it already impressed visiting Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Jefferson," wrote the Marquis de Chastellux, who had been a commander of 
the French army in America, "is the first American who has consulted the Fine 
Arts to know how he should shelter himself from the weather." 
</P>
<P>
The second phase began after Jefferson tired of Cabinet squabbling and resigned 
as secretary of state in 1795. Returning to Monticello, he redesigned the house 
and started to enlarge it from eight to 21 rooms, adapting many ideas from 
Parisian architecture and placing classical French art and exquisite French 
crafts throughout. 
</P>
<P>
"Were I to proceed to tell you how much I enjoy their architecture," Jefferson 
had written to a friend from France, ". . . I would want words." 
</P>
<P>
In his most dramatic change, Jefferson removed the second story of the original 
Monticello and set the distinctive octagonal dome upon it. Although his use of 
glass and wooden ribs followed the architectural principles of the Halle aux 
Bleds, Jefferson based the overall design of the dome on that of the Hotel de 
Salm, near his own Paris home on the Right Bank of the Seine. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel de Salm, now the Palace of the Legion of Honor alongside the enormous 
Museum D'Orsay, was built during Jefferson's stay in Paris, and he told friends 
that he was "violently smitten" with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other French Influences 
</P>
<P>
There are a host of other French influences in the Virginia house: the double 
tier of bedroom windows patterned after the pavilion in the Parc Monceau of 
Paris; the use of skylights over the dining room and main bedroom; sculptures 
by Jean Antoine Houdon bought directly from his studio in Paris; exquisite 
French clocks, including one made by Chantrot of Paris from Jefferson's design; 
lovely Parisian mirrors; a French portrait of Benjamin Franklin; a great number 
of Louis XVI chairs and other splendid furniture and goblets that Jefferson 
commissioned from Paris silversmiths. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that there are so many French furnishings. After Jefferson 
left Paris his assistant, William Short, shipped 86 cases of the future 
President's possessions from France to Virginia. Under Jefferson's injunction 
to leave anything unsuitable for America behind, Short did not pack five 
dumbwaiters and a few other items. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson also took a French chef with him to Virginia, and the dominant Gallic 
tone of the Monticello table and wine cellar was known throughout the new 
United States. After dinner in Monticello, Daniel Webster remarked that it had 
been "served half in Virginia, half in French style, in good taste and 
abundance." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jefferson's talents as an architect and designer were sometimes 
derided in the 19th Century, Monticello, after it was bought by the Thomas 
Jefferson Memorial Foundation in 1923 and restored, has become one of the most 
popular sites from early American history. It attracts upward of half a million 
visitors every year.
