   The French Revolution's bicentennial is coming up
next year, with fireworks, political and historical squabbles,
commemorative underwear and miniature guillotines all part of the
show.
   The festivities are designed to peak July 14 on the 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison in 1789, the
most memorable event of the long and turbulent revolutionary years.
   Even in a normal year, Bastille Day celebrations of military
regalia on the Champs-Elysees, dancing in local fire halls and
fireworks in the skies mark July 14 in Paris and provincial towns _
similar to the American 4th of July.
   But organizers are working frantically to make 1989's events
unforgettable.
   They admit to being far behind schedule, partly because both the
first man chosen to head the Bicentennial Mission, businessman
Michel Baroin, and his successor, centrist politician Edgar Faure,
died shortly after taking office, leaving the agency leaderless
until this past May.
   Jean-Noel Jeanneney, the new president of the bicentennial
operation, told reporters recently after meeting with President
Francois Mitterrand that he hoped to have his plans spelled out by
the end of September.
   ``When you have less time to do things, you do them in less
time,'' Jeanneney said. ``Many great events that went down in
history were prepared in extreme haste.''
   The planning was also hung up in political feuding during the
past two years, when the conservative government of Jacques Chirac
was jousting with Mitterrand, a Socialist.
   After Mitterrand's re-election in May and the installation of
Socialist Michel Rocard as premier, the mission's budget was nearly
tripled, to the franc equivalent of about $20 million.
   Chirac, who remains involved in the bicentennial as mayor of
Paris, recently said he had the feeling the Socialists ``want to
profit from this commemoration by emphasizing certain historical
aspects in the presentation, to the detriment of the consensus that
Michel Baroin and Edgar Faure were promoting.''
   The French Revolution has been a focus for political divisions
ever since it began, and the approach of the bicentennial renewed
the debate over what, exactly, was being celebrated.
   There are many variations of the Revolution, but in broad terms
French rightists are likely to say they approve of the abolition of
the nobility's privileges in 1789 and the establishment of the
republic in 1792, but are appalled by the mass executions of the
Terror in 1793-94.
   Some French leftists argue that people should take the
Revolution as an undivided whole _ and be for it or against it.
They suggest that rightists picking and choosing among elements of
the Revolution are closet counter-revolutionaries.
   ``It's surprising that, two centuries later, the founding act of
the Republic remains a propaganda tool and a source of partisan
quarrels and polemics, but it's also a consequence of the
revolutionary heritage itself,'' the independent newspaper Le Monde
wrote in a front-page article summing up the squabbles.
   A poll published in the conservative weekly Le Figaro Magazine
found that, when asked to name which events best symbolize the
Revolution, 74 percent of French people said the Declaration of the
Rights of Man on Oct. 2, 1789, with only 55 percent choosing the
bloody July 14 assault on the Bastille prison.
   Although the Bastille was a hated symbol of repression, and once
housed political prisoners, the revolutionary crowd that
overwhelmed its defenders found only seven inmates to be freed:
four men convicted of fraud, two lunatics, and a nobleman, the
count de Salages, who was imprisoned for incest.
   Le Figaro's poll also found 61 percent saying King Louis XVI
should not have been beheaded at the guillotine, while 14 percent
maintained it was the right thing to do and 25 percent had no
opinion.
   The U.S. bicentennial did not turn up many Americans who thought
the American Revolution was a bad thing, but in France some people
are still against the whole idea of their own uprising.
   ``We think it was a revolt against God and not just a revolt
against power,'' said Jean-Baptiste Chaumeil, a member of a group
hoping to make a counter-revolutionary demonstration Aug. 15, 1989,
at Place de la Concorde _ where the guillotine stood _ one of the
biggest events of the bicentennial year.
   Chaumeil said the group, called Association 15 Aout 1989 (August
15 Association), includes both Royalists, who want France to have a
king again, and Republicans, who oppose any return to the monarchy
but find a celebration of the Revolution's anti-church policies
distasteful.
   For the past year, a monthly newsletter called ``L'Anti-89'' has
been recalling the dark side of the Revolution, especially its
harsh suppression of Roman Catholic clergy.
   The group is distributing a poster showing a revolutionary
carrying a guillotined head on a spike and asks, ``Are We REALLY
Going To Celebrate That?''
   In fact, miniature guillotines for sale as souvenirs are among
the many commercial spinoffs of the bicentennial.
   Textile manufacturer CET has obtained permission to use the
official bicentennial logo, showing three blue-white-and-red doves
in flight, on a line of clothing, and CET director Christian
Mariolle said he expects the T-shirt and the underpants to be the
best-sellers, both in France and as an export.
   The Bastille itself was demolished, but its bells survived and
will be part of an exhibition of revolutionary artifacts touring
the country next year.
   Plans are being laid for elaborate operas at Versailles and for
coverting the Tuileries Gardens between the Louvre and the Place de
la Concorde into a collection of pavilions, games, and expositions
on the bicentennial.
   On a more scholarly note, the weekly Livres-Hebdo counted 205
books on the Revolution to be published before the celebration is
over. Hundreds of colloquiums and seminars have been announced, on
topics ranging from ``The French Revolution and Revolutionary
Vandalism'' to ``The Revolution and Childrens's Books.''
   The bicentennial year will also see the completion of several
major building projects started by Mitterrand early in his first
term _ a new Opera House at the Bastille site, the controversial
glass pyramid of architect I.M. Pei at the Louvre, and a giant
cube-shaped arch under construction at the Western edge of the
city, on a direct line of sight with the Place de la Concorde and
the Arc de Triomphe.
   The new triumphal arch's crosspiece, when open, is to house a
Center for the Study of the Rights of Man, which is supposed to
keep the bicentennial spirit alive in years to come.
   Mitterrand will be busy, both inaugurating his buildings and
welcoming visiting heads of state.
   Next year is France's turn to be host for the economic summit of
leaders of the seven richest industrial democracies and Mitterrand
has persuaded his peers to make the dates July 14-16, rather than
in June, as usual. The new president of the United States will be
one of the seven.
   Mitterrand says he will also invite many other government
leaders, especially from Latin America and the Third World, to come
to Paris at the same time and join in the celebrations.
