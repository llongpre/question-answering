   Legend has it that King Louis XVI lost his head over
a pig's foot _ no surprise in this culinary capital, where
gastronomy ranks as fine art and eating is a sacred ritual.
   So it was fitting that a pig's foot, cooked to perfection from a
recipe dating to the French Revolution, was the first offering in an
11-course feast prepared by six famous French chefs and served up
Monday night to 280 guests at the Pre Catalan restaurant in the Bois
de Bologne.
   The culinary extravaganza, called ``If 1789 Was Cooked For Me,''
was part of the Revolution's bicentennial celebration. Invited
guests included show business celebrities, cabinet ministers and
members of the diplomatic corps.
   Guests were greeted by costumed footmen and lasses in low-cut
dresses with bustles, and they dined off recreations of Havilland
china from the period.
   The food was fit for kings. Yet each course, carefully researched
by food historians Claude Quetel, Philip and Mary Hyman, was
standard middle-class fare 200 years ago.
   ``We were very careful to choose simple dishes that people
actually ate,'' Quetel said in an interview.
   The dinner, he said, was a way of subduing the passions still
unleashed by the French Revolution.
   ``That's one sure way to get the French to agree. On the right or
the left, the French know good food from bad,'' he said.
   Back in 1789, bourgeois Parisians dined on a stew of boiled
capon, a dish that fell out of favor when American turkeys were
introduced.
   Joel Robuchon, chef at the restaurant Jamin in Paris, selected
the finest specially raised nine-pound birds, at $12 a pound, but
roasted them inside a crust of sea salt, instead of boiling them.
   ``That way, you can be sure that all the breasts aren't
overcooked, or the legs undercooked,'' Robuchon said.
   Also popular in the late 18th century was the hearty ``garbure''
_ a version of corned beef and cabbage that later became one of
France's greatest specialties before nearly disappearing altogether.
   The creation of Alain Dutournier, chef at Le Carre des Feuillants
in Paris, this delicacy from the Gascogny region in southwestern
France was one of the most appreciated dishes of the evening.
   ``It's definitely my favorite. It has taste, it has body,'' said
Guy Legay, chef at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
   Quetel said the recipe for the cabbage soup was unearthed in a
19th century cookbook, ``Cuisinier Durand.'' Its author had cooked
for years for a marquis, but lost his job in the Revolution and
opened his own restaurant in Nimes.
   In 1789, in the south of France, fresh fish too small to be sold
at market were poached in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and
anchovies by the fishermen who hauled them in. Prepared by Alain
Ducasse of the ``Hotel de Paris'' in Monte Carlo, ``la matelote du
poissonier'' is considered to be the revolutionary ancestor of the
Provencal bouillabaisse.
   Stuffed carp was inspired by a 1739 recipe and prepared by
Antoine Westermann, chef at Le Burerehiesel in Strasbourg.
Fresh-water fish appeared on the finest tables until the 19th
century when salt-water fish came into favor.
   Jean Bardet, chef-owner of a restaurant in Tours which bears his
name, said he cooked _ and ate _ dozens of pigs' feet before getting
the centuries-old ``Ste. Menehould'' recipe right.
   ``I had a recipe from 1758 naming the different spices used:
cinnamon, the shell of fresh nutmeg, coriander and cloves,'' Bardet
said. ``The problem was that there was no mention of proportions, so
I spent two weeks trying different combinations. I ended up gaining
seven kilos (15 pounds).''
   Louis XVI, according to legend, was undone by his penchant for
pigs' feet. Fleeing the Revolution in 1791, he insisted on stopping
in Ste. Menould, a small town near Reims, long enough to savor the
house speciality of the Soleil d'Or inn. That's where his foes
caught him, and he was returned to Paris where he was guillotined in
1793.
   Master baker Lionel Poilane concocted a special bicentennial
bread made from spelt flour, a coarse wheat flour that was a staple
in 1789 and now a rarity.
   Even though the French of yesteryear consumed many fewer desserts
than today, Gaston Lenotre resuscitated five from the past,
including an unusual carrot tart with a crunchy caramel topping.
Provencal pastry balls were so hard that some guests joked they
would have made great revolutionary cannon fodder.
   The culinary extravaganza was sponsored by the 230-year-old
champagne house Henri Abele.
   Champagne was not popular during the Revolution, but it was Louis
XVI's favorite drink, and he is said to have consumed a bottle at
each meal, even in the final days before his beheading.
