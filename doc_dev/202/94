opera house faces a critical year

When the curtains swung to a close at the end of Messiaen's St Francis of
Assisi at the Opera Bastille in Paris on Tuesday, it marked the end of a
traumatic year at France's lavish new opera house.
The trouble started this summer when a set collapsed during a touring
production of Otello in Seville, killing one singer and injuring 36 others.
The tragedy aggravated the tension among the Bastille management. Mr
Philippe Belaval resigned as chief executive in August, together with six
senior colleagues. Then there was a furore over the new contract of his
former foe, Mr Myung-Whun Chung, now one of the highest-paid artistic
directors in international opera.
The new management is beginning a critical year: it must heal the scars of
Seville and establish the Bastille as a centre of excellence in
international opera. It may also confront a less sympathetic political
climate if, as the opinion polls suggest, the ruling Socialists, who founded
the Opera Bastille, lose the March general elections and the right returns
to power.
The litany of trials and tribulations is very different from the picture
painted by President Francois Mitterrand in 1982 when he unfurled his plans
for a new 'people's opera'. Paris opera was in the doldrums. The old Opera
Garnier was run down. The president envisaged a brand new opera house with
cheap seats, state-of-the-art acoustics and magnificent music.
The government spent almost FFr3bn (Pounds 365m) to build the 2,700-seat
house at place de la Bastille. It is run as part of the Opera de Paris
together with the Garnier, now used for dance, and the smaller Opera
Comique. It has an annual budget of FFr800m, of which the state provides 65
per cent. President Mitterrand in 1988 appointed Mr Pierre Berge, one of his
staunchest supporters and dubbed Pierre le Panthere for his ruthless style
in running the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, as chairman of Opera de
Paris.
But the melodrama began even before the Bastille's opening. A string of
resignations culminated in early 1989 with that of Mr Daniel Barenboim, the
conductor, who stormed out as artistic director after a row with Mr Berge.
Mr Chung, then a comparatively obscure Korean conductor, succeeded him. The
Opera Bastille opened its first full opera, Les Troyens by Berlioz, in March
1990 to mixed reviews.
The reviews have remained mixed ever since. The Bastille is almost always
full, with an audience of 392,290 last year. It has also had some success in
fulfilling its populist mandate. Almost a third of its audience are
first-time opera goers. But it has been haunted by complaints about the
building, a lacklustre response from the critics and more management
problems.
'I'm French and I'm an opera buff, I want it to work,' said Mr Alain
Lompech, opera critic of the daily newspaper, Le Monde. 'But there has only
been one production good enough to launch Paris opera on the international
arena - Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth, directed by Chung.'
One obstacle is the glacial, modernist building, designed by Carlos Ott,
which has been criticised on architectural and musical grounds. 'It was a
wonderful idea to build a new opera house, but the acoustics are not great
and the theatre is a disaster,' said Mr Max Loppert, the FT's opera critic.
'The scale of the stage makes it difficult to put on anything other than the
very biggest operas.'
The Bastille is now mooting plans for a Petite Salle with 1,100 seats for
smaller productions. However, its hopes of securing the state's financial
support could be scuppered if the Conservatives win the March elections.
Last time the right was in power, in the mid-1980s, it tried to scrap the
Bastille project by calling a halt to the building work. A future
Conservative government might be less generous to the new opera house than
the sympathetic Socialists.
Meanwhile, there is little the Bastille can do about its labyrinthine
lay-out. 'It's impossible to find your way around,' said Mr Lompech. 'I've
been there dozens of times but I'm still so confused that, whenever I leave
my seat, I can't find my way back.'
The Bastille has also been hounded by the strikes and stoppages that dogged
the Garnier. The French government baulked at adding a battle with the opera
unions to its other difficulties before the opening, so the new house
retains the old union agreements, which have lumbered it with a high wage
bill and rigid working practices. The 'people's opera' is also burdened by
high prices: tickets range from FFr50 to FFr560, but two-thirds cost more
than FFr200.
Mr Belaval spent his 20 months as chief executive in intricate negotiations,
trying to thrash out a new union agreement. But this summer Mr Berge
intervened, and bowed to union pressure by extending the deadline for the
negotiations from August to November. Mr Belaval, already fuming after rows
with Mr Chung over who was to blame for the Seville disaster, resigned. The
November deadline has passed, but the negotiations are still going on.
The union problems, combined with frequent management changes - Mr Belaval
was the fourth chief executive to resign in as many years - have made it
difficult for the Bastille to fulfil its creative potential. Mr Loppert's
view is that it has 'not lived up to expectations'. Even Mr Chung admitted
to Le Monde this autumn that he was unhappy with the quality of output and
that, in three years, he had only been satisfied with one production, Lady
Macbeth.
The Bastille desperately needs a period of stability to recover from the
trauma of the Seville tour. So far only half the injured singers have
returned to work. Mr Chung must then get to grips with its music, while the
management, under Mr Jean-Paul Cluzel, the new chief executive, tackles the
unions.
There are some positive signs. Mr Chung's new contract not only increases
his financial package - which will rise from FFr3.3m next year to FFr8m at
the end of his six-year term - but also considerably extends his power.
'Until now he hasn't really had the chance to be anything other than a good
conductor,' said one critic. He now has complete control over programming
and artistic policy, and will be consulted on some administrative issues.
Mr Cluzel, meanwhile, is a high-flying bureaucrat, who has headed the
Socialists' arts administration reforms but who also has the advantage of
close contacts with the right, having worked for a Conservative minister in
the mid-1980s. His ability to straddle both sides of the French political
arena could prove invaluable to the opera house after the elections.
But if there is a change of government this spring, it seems doubtful that
even Mr Cluzel will be able to prevent the Opera Bastille from being
embroiled in a repetition of the mid-1980s power struggle between President
Mitterrand and the Conservatives, particularly as Mr Berge is so close to
the president. The Opera Bastille seems set for another melodramatic year.
