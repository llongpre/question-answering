   Lighting the Paris sky with an explosion of color,
France wrapped up a three-day, $50 million celebration of the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution and disproved critics'
predictions the fest would fall flat.
   President Bush, in Paris for bicentennial festivities and a
meeting of the leaders of the world's seven richest democracies,
told the congregation at the American Cathedral on Sunday that both
events reaffirmed ``the right of all men and women to be free.''
   The night before, bouquets of color from 170,000 rockets washed
the sky over the Eiffel Tower in a 45-minute display that culminated
in a 200-foot-wide tableau of the ship of Paris, the city's symbol,
in the blue, white and red colors of France.
   Police said 400,000 to 500,000 people viewed the fireworks
display, one day after a 1 million people mobbed the Champs-Elysees
to see a whimsical, avant-garde parade that was the centerpiece of
the festival.
   Critics had predicted the economic summit would detract from the
revolution's message of liberty, equality and fraternity, or even
insult more than two dozen leaders of developing nations in town for
the bicentennial.
   There also were fears the parade created by advertising star
Jean-Paul Goude and broadcast to hundreds of millions of TV viewers
worldwide would be an embarrassment.
   But the consensus was that it was a hit. Even the staunchly
conservative daily Le Figaro, usually hostile to any initiative of
the Socialist government, ran a banner headline reading ``The
Triumph of the Revolution'' _ but with a cartoon showing a housewife
grumbling over the cost.
   Premier Michel Rocard sent a message to the president of the
Bicentennial Mission, Jean-Noel Jeanneney, congratulating him for
the ``exceptional success.''
   Culture Minister Jack Lang said the French gave a ``frank and
giant `Yes''' to the bicentennial.
   ``We offered modernity at the risk of derision,'' Jeanneney
acknowledged. But ``the commemoration became national and
planetary.''
   Goude's parade, called ``The Marseillaise'' after the national
anthem, featured African drummers, dancing Soviet bears,
cheerleaders and an American marching band that moonwalked down the
avenue.
   American opera star Jessye Norman sang the French national anthem
midway through the evening.
   ``The gamble was without doubt a little crazy, but it was won,''
Le Monde wrote, calling the parade ``surprising and original.'' It
``did not give the idea _ to say the least _ of a chauvinistic and
xenophobic France.''
   Mitterrand, asked Sunday at a news conference what he thought of
the criticism, replied: ``What counts is the result.''
