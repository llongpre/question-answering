   President Bush, saying that he looks forward to
next week's visit to France, signed a proclamation Friday to
commemorate the 200th anniversary of the fall of the Bastille and
the close ties between France and the United States.
   The president said there is a close connection between the United
States Bill of Rights and the French Declaration of the Rights of
Man.
   ``The themes of liberty and human rights which run through these
two documents are fundamental to our two nations and the people of
Eastern Europe where I will be visiting next week as well,'' he said.
   ``So today, as 200 years ago, France and America are still
partners in liberty,'' Bush said.
   Present at the signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room of the
White House were French Ambassador Emmanuel de Margerie, former Sen.
Charles McC. Mathias, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Vice President Quayle.
   Bush used two pens in signing the document, giving one to
deMargerie and one to Mathias.
