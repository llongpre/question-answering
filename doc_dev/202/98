If the French love a good anniversary, it is less for the warm pleasure of
recollection than for the fierce passion of reliving old battles. In 1989
the celebration of the bicentenary demonstrated that the revolution is still
not over, whatever the historians may say. Last year the centenary of the
birth of Charles de Gaulle showed that the founder of the Fifth Republic can
still provoke controversy from beyond the grave. This week, on Friday, we
have the 10th anniversary of Francois Mitterrand's first presidential
election victory; and much of the French political establishment is in a
froth about it, either to celebrate or to denounce this decade of socialist
government.
Now 10 years in power is a long time for one man, as Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
claque never ceased to remind us. But when it's over, it's over, and in the
meantime it is an unremarkable span when measured against the tides of
history. So it may seem disproportionate to speak of President Mitterrand's
decade in the same breath as the centenary of de Gaulle or the bicentenary
of the French Revolution. But there are two reasons why it may not be
far-fetched.
The first is that Mr Mitterrand has steadily grown in stature on the French
national stage, and it has now become quite normal in France to measure him
against de Gaulle. Indeed, a recent best-selling assessment of Mr Mitterrand
was explicitly constructed as a point-by-point comparison between him and de
Gaulle, and by no means always to Mr Mitterrand's disadvantage.
Moreover, it is a measure of Mr Mitterrand's charisma that the opposition
parties virtually never criticise him in person, an immunity which owes more
to his acquired authority than to the eminence of his presidential office.
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the opposition Gaullist RPR party, may denounce
the socialists as 'evil-doers, incapable, immoral and intolerant', but he is
careful not to name Mr Mitterrand in his denunciation.
Mr Mitterrand's supporters would claim that he has already made a
contribution to French history which is, in its own way, every bit as
important as anything achieved by de Gaulle; and a contribution to European
history which is far greater; and they may be right on both counts.
After the humiliations of the Second World War, de Gaulle restored
self-confidence in the arrogant diplomacy of the nation-state; after the
switchbacks of the Fourth Republic, he restored belief in the reliability of
strong government. But the flaw in the Gaullist legacy is its anachronism:
having reached its apogee in the 19th century, the arrogance of the
nation-state is out of date in the modern world. Moreover, the kind of
strong government de Gaulle could deliver was too long on drama and too
short on democratic sensitivity; he seized power through a virtual coup, and
he was driven off by popular rejection.
For journalists, de Gaulle was a delight; the combination of an
international naughty boy, who was both a master of the theatrical coup and
a master of the French language, was irresistible. But it wouldn't do for
very long, and indeed it didn't.
Outwardly, Mr Mitterrand has continued to drape himself in the Gaullist
flag; he told the nation after the Gulf war that France had lived up to her
'rank' in the world. But his real attainments have been the exact opposite
of the ambitions of de Gaulle, and they are likely to prove more durable.
The first of these attainments is that he has presided over the conversion
of the French people, both to an acceptance of the market economy, and to
the overriding need for rigorous and stable economic management. Considering
his heritage, this is extraordinary; he came to power with a policy
combining Colbertism with socialism, and the mixture quickly proved lethal.
His conversion to a different economic rulebook has achieved a result which
eluded his conservative predecessors, including de Gaulle: the whole world
now believes in a strong and stable franc.
To make that other cross-reference, between Mr Mitterrand's 10 years in
power and the French Revolution, may seem contrived; and Mr Mitterrand
himself went through acrobatic contortions during the bicentenary
celebrations to sanitise the historical record, as if five years of chaos
and slaughter could be reduced to its immaculate prologue, the Declaration
of the Rights of Man. Yet there are points of contrast, like the abolition
of the death penalty in 1981, which are not irrelevant.
Moreover, on the European scene the comparison is striking and far-reaching.
The French Revolution led to the mobilisation of the nation in arms, for the
conquest of Europe and the invasion of Russia. But the Napoleonic model of
heroic action, which has lent such a frisson to national pride, is now in
the final stages of being comprehensively junked (despite the Gulf war), in
favour of an integrationist model which is civilian, law-based and
democratic.
Of course, this is not just Mr Mitterrand's doing: manifestly he is one of
the moving spirits in the current acceleration of the European Community,
but others had the idea before him, and others are vital to the process
today. But that's just the point: this is a new model, which is just as
revolutionary as the French Revolution, and a good deal more durable.
Europe's integration process has been going on for longer, more
consistently, and more constructively, than all the zig-zags, constitutions,
communes and dictatorships which lay between the fall of the Bastille and
the fall of Napoleon.
In that sense the Mitterrand decade is shorthand for a sweeping
transformation of the facts and assumptions of international life, such as
has rarely taken place in history. In 1981 we had martial law in Poland and
the Russians in Afghanistan; in 1991 we have the gradual implosion of the
Soviet empire and the negotiation of treaties on economic and political
union in western Europe.
Put it this way: if you had to identify the past decade with one person,
which are the other candidates? Would it be Reagan? Or Thatcher? Or
Gorbachev?
