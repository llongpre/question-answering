   A young Korean conductor was named today as music
director at the new Opera-Bastille, ending months of public
speculation.
   Myung-Whun Chung, 36, who has studied and performed in the
United States, fills the vacancy left in January when Paris Opera
Chairman Pierre Berge fired Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim,
accusing him of elitist ideas on opera and saying his salary was
too high.
   ``I have preferred to bet on youth and audacity,'' Berge, the
head of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion empire, told reporters. ``He
is a man of talent, integrity, ambition and enthusiasm.'' He
declined to disclose Chung's salary.
   Chung was on hand for the announcement which was made during a
heated news conference held in the Opera-Bastille's brand new
amphitheater, a sleek design in glass and marbled polished granite.
   Berge and Chung were pressed for details on their plans for
performances but said they could not yet provide them. The schedule
for the new Opera has been the subject of intense public disputes
for years.
   ``If there is a fight, and I'll say it publicly right now, I
won't fight, I'll just leave,'' the soft-spoken Chung said in
English, translated into French for reporters.
   ``I have one request _ that we work together for the benefit of
the Opera Bastille as a unified team and do not let other people
throw us off,'' he said.
   Berge was appointed by President Francois Mitterrand to
supervise the final days of the Opera-Bastille project during the
countdown to its inauguration on July 13. The gala concert, to be
performed before Mitterrand, President Bush and a host of other
VIPs, is to be one of the centerpieces of official celebrations of
the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   It will feature a series of classical arias from famous French
operas sung by a cast of international singers and staged by
American Bob Wilson, the longtime darling of the French avant-garde.
   Chung was born in Seoul, South Korea, on Jan. 22, 1953, and
moved with his family to the United States in 1971 so that he and
his gifted sisters could pursue their music studies. His younger
sister is the well-known violinist Kyung-Wha Chung and his older
sister is the cellist Myung-Wha Chung.
   He studied piano and conducting at the Mannes School of Music in
New York and in 1974, won second prize in the Tchaikovsky Piano
Competition in Moscow.
   He entered the Juilliard School of Music the following year as a
conducting student. In 1978 he became assistant to Carlo Maria
Giulini and associate conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
   He is the principal guest conductor at the Teatro Communale and
Maggio Musicale festival in Florence, Italy, where he is conducting
Mozart's ``Idomeneo.''
   Although Chung is known as a serious and gifted musician, his
selection came as a surprise because of his limited experience in
conducting opera.
