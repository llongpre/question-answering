   A white anti-apartheid
activist was shot and killed Monday outside his home by an
assailant firing from a passing car, police said.
   Colleagues said they had no doubt that David Webster, 44, was
assassinated because of his political activities.
   Webster, a lecturer in social anthropology at the University of
the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and a prominent member of several
anti-apartheid organizations, was a leading opponent of the
government's policy of detention without trial and held periodic
tea parties for the families of detained black activists.
   Police said Webster died almost instantly after he was hit in
the back by a bullet fired from a heavy-caliber weapon outside his
home in the Johannesburg neighborhood of Troyeville. Nothing was
known about the assailant, police added
   With Webster at the time was Maggie Friedman, a friend and
fellow member of the Human Rights Commission, a Johannesburg-based
monitoring group established by anti-apartheid activists last year.
She said Webster was shot after they had returned from buying
plants at a nursery.
   She said she heard a noise from a passing car which she thought
had backfired, then saw Webster stagger and tell her: ``I've been
shot with a shotgun. Get an ambulance.''
   ``It is clear to me that his killing was a highly professional
job,'' she said. ``I find it frightening that those who opposed him
were prepared to go to such lengths to eliminate someone.''
   Dozens of black activists have been killed in recent years in
unsolved murders. The Five Freedoms Forum, a human rights groups
with which Webster worked, described Monday's killing as one of the
first assassinations of a white activist.
   ``We are deeply shocked by this blatant assassination of our
dear comrade,'' said Mohammed Valli Moosa, a former detainee who
serves as unofficial spokesman for major anti-apartheid groups.
   ``We are concerned that his death comes as a result of
unflinching opposition to the system of apartheid,'' Valli Moosa
said. ``The only beneficiaries of his death are those who have an
interest in perpetuating this evil system.''
