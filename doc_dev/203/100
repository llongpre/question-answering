  [Text] Johannesburg May 6 SAPA -- Thabo Mbeki, named as a 
first deputy-president by African National Congress President 
Nelson Mandela on Friday [6 May], was born in Idutywa, Transkei, 
in June, 1942. 
  His appointment as first deputy-president significantly 
increases his chances as ANC crown prince, favoured to succeed 
Nelson Mandela as leader. He is also the ANC national chairman. 
  Both his parents were teachers and activists. His father, 
Govan, was a university graduate who was later jailed on Robben 
Island for his part in the ANC's campaign against apartheid. 
  Earlier, Govan was a leading figure in ANC activities in the 
Eastern Cape. 
  Thabo Mbeki joined the ANC Youth League at 14 and quickly 
became active in student politics. After his schooling at 
Lovedale was interrupted by a strike in 1959, he completed his 
studies at home. Thereafter, he moved to Johannesburg where he 
came under the guidance of Walter Sisulu and Duma Nokwe. 
  While studying for his A-levels, he was elected secretary of 
the African Students' Association (ASA). 
  He went on to study economics as a correspondence student 
with London University. 
  The ASA collapsed following the arrest of many of its 
members, at a time when political movements were coming under 
increasingly severe attack from the state. Mbeki's father was 
arrested at Rivonia and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  Thabo Mbeki left the country in 1962 under orders from the 
ANC. From Tanzania, he moved to Britain where he completed a 
Masters Degree in Economics at Sussex University in 1966. 
Remaining active in student politics, he played a prominent role 
in building the youth and student sections of the ANC in exile. 
  After his studies, he worked at the London office with the 
late Oliver Tambo, who was to become ANC president, and Dr Yusuf 
Dadoo before being sent to the Soviet Union in 1970 for military 
training. 
  Later that year, he arrived in Lusaka where he was soon 
appointed assistant secretary of the revolutionary council. 
  In 1975, he was acting ANC representative in Swaziland. 
  Appointed to the ANC National Executive Committee in 1975, 
he 
served as ANC representative to Nigeria until 1978, then moved 
to Lusaka to become political secretary in the office of Oliver 
Tambo, and then director of information. 
  From this position, he played a major role in turning the 
international media against apartheid. His other role in the 
'70s was in building the ANC in Swaziland and underground 
structures inside South Africa. 
  During the '80s, Mbeki rose to head the Department of 
Information and Publicity and co-ordinated diplomatic campaigns 
to involve more white South Africans in anti-apartheid 
activities.
