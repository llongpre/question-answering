   Members of a secret
intelligence unit planted bombs, were suspects in political
killings and plotted to harass Archbishop Desmond Tutu by sending
him a baboon fetus, an intelligence official said Monday.
   Gen. Rudolph Badenhorst, head of the Military Intelligence
branch of the Defense Force, was the first witness to testify
before a judicial inquiry into allegations of military and police
participation in death squads.
   Opposition leaders claim the squads may have been involved in
about 60 unsolved murders of anti-government activists in the past
decade.
   Badenhorst said the Civil Cooperation Bureau _ a unit so secret
that President F.W. de Klerk says he was not told of its existence
until recently _ had blown up a Pretoria store owned by an
anti-apartheid activist, exploded a bomb at a community hall in a
mixed-race township near Cape Town and planned to deliver a baboon
fetus to Tutu, an anti-apartheid leader and winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize.
   Badenhorst gave no reason for the plan to send the fetus. He
said the idea was called ``Operation Apie.''
   The intelligence chief said an internal military investigation
begun in November revealed that prominent anti-apartheid activists
such as black mineworkers leader Cyril Ramaphosa, the Rev. Frank
Chikane of the South African Council of Churches and Jay Naidoo,
general secretary of the nation's largest trade union federation,
were on a list to have their movements monitored.
   He maintained that he did not know the bureau existed before
November and he didn't know the purpose of the surveillance.
   The secret unit reportedly consisted of cells of civilians,
mostly former policemen, in undercover operations against
government opponents.
   An attorney for the Civil Cooperation Bureau said its chief,
Col. Joe Verster, had been detained Friday for questioning by
police who are investigating the 1989 assassinations of David
Webster, a Johannesburg anthropologist, and Anton Lubowski, the
only white executive member of the South-West African People's
Organization in Namibia.
   Badenhorst confirmed that three former policemen wanted in
Lubowski's death were members of the Civil Cooperation Bureau. All
three disappeared last month after police in Namibia issued
warrants for their arrests. Badenhorst said the Civil Cooperation
Bureau was not involved in Webster's slaying.
   He said that during questioning by military investigators,
Verster had seemed surprised at some of the activities of bureau
members, and was especially surprised by the hiring of an
ex-policeman, Ferdie Barnard, after he had been released from
prison.
   De Klerk, who became president in August, said Defense Minister
Magnus Malan did not tell him of the Civil Cooperation Bureau until
January. Badenhorst told the commission de Klerk had not sanctioned
any of the unit's activities.
   Malan said Monday he did not know the bureau existed until
November.
   The defense minister has said he never authorized killings or
other illegal acts, but he has come under increasing pressure from
opposition parties to resign.
   In another judicial inquiry ordered by de Klerk, Supreme Court
Justice Richard Goldstone ruled that Clayton Sizwe Sithole,
identified by friends as the former boyfriend of Nelson Mandela's
youngest daughter, Zindziwe, committed suicide in police custody on
Jan. 27.
   Sithole had been arrested with others in a murder investigation,
and after police interrogation he was found hanging by his
shoelaces and belt at the Johannesburg police headquarters.
   Goldstone said there were no recent injuries on his body other
than those associated with hanging.
