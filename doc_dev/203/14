   Three convicted murderers were
hanged today, but another received a stay of execution after
claiming he was part of a police death squad that killed a
prominent black anti-apartheid activist.
   Butana Nofemela was to be hanged at dawn at Pretoria Central
Prison along with two other blacks and a mixed-race man. But
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee, after receiving an urgent request
from human rights lawyers, granted a stay of execution pending an
investigation of Nofemela's claims.
   According to lawyers, Nofemela said in an affadavit he was one
of four security policemen who killed activist Griffiths Mxenge in
1981 under orders from senior officers. Nofemela also said he was
partly responsible for the killings of eight other political
activists ordered by his superiors.
   Nofemela, 32, was convicted in 1987 of murdering a white farmer
in a case apparently without political overtones.
   Peter Mothle, a director of the Pretoria-based organization
Lawyers for Human Rights, said lawyers who studied Nofemela's
affidavit found it credible, containing accurate details related to
Mxenge's killings.
   Mxenge's body was found outside a Durban-area stadium in
November 1981. He had been stabbed more than 40 times.
   Mxenge's wife, Victoria, an attorney and activist, was killed in
August 1985. They are among several dozen anti-apartheid activists
_ black and white _ who have been killed in recent years in cases
that have never been solved.
   Many activists believe most or all of the killings were carried
out by elements of the security forces.
   After the assassination in May of David Webster, a white
activist and university lecturer, police formed a special
investigative force to probe both that killing and unsolved
bombings of offices of anti-apartheid groups. No arrests have been
made.
   Mothle said Nofemela's claims initially would be investigated by
the office of the Transvaal Province attorney general.
   ``We hope they won't turn it over to the police, but we have no
control over that,'' he said.
   The three hangings Friday raised to 45 the number of executions
so far this year. One of the prisoners was a mixed-race man
convicted of killing two residents of an retirement home.
   The other two were blacks convicted of murder during a 1986
robbery.
   Two of the men hanged this year were white, the rest black or of
mixed-race. The number of hangings so far this year is much lower
than in recent years, such as 1987, when a record 164 people were
hanged.
   The government says 60 condemned prisoners have received
reprieves this year. More than 200 prisoners, nearly all of them
black men, remain on Death Row.
   Anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa, including senior members
of the African National Congress guerrilla movement freed last
Sunday, have listed an end to executions as one of their conditions
for agreeing to enter negotiations with the white-led government.
