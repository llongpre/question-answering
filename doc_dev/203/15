   Three anti-apartheid activists
who escaped from custody and fled to the U.S. Consulate five weeks
ago emerged Wednesday and pledged to resume their opposition to the
government.
   South African authorities say they won't arrest the three, who
had been jailed without charge for more a year before they slipped
away from police guards and fled to the consulate Sept. 13.
   The activists _ all senior officials of banned anti-apartheid
organizations _ spent the next 36 nights in a consular meeting room
on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office building.
   The three said they had little faith in the government's promise
not to act against them.
   ``Our experience with the government is that we must be very
cautious and not accept anything at face vale,'' said Murphy Morobe.
   But they added they were influenced to leave their sanctuary on
the advice of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela.
   ``The view of comrade Nelson Mandela was that we should leave
the consulate as soon as possible, and that assisted us in our
decision,'' said Mohammed Valli Moosa.
   Mandela's message was relayed to the men via his wife, Winnie.
The couple met Saturday at the Cape Town clinic where Mandela is
recuperating from tuberculosis.
   ``We entered the U.S. Consulate not simply to secure our own
freedom, but to stir the conscience of South Africa and the
international community about the plight of our fellow detainees,''
said Valli Moosa.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge
during the 28-month-old state of emergency. About 1,000 are
believed in detention.
   The three smiled broadly as they embraced their families and
colleagues waiting for them in the lobby of the building. Scores of
journalists and about 200 supporters also were present.
   The activists gave clenched-fist salutes to the cheering crowd,
mostly young blacks who chanted ``Amandla,'' the Zulu word for
``power.''
   Riot police, armed with truncheons and shotguns, sought to keep
the crowd under control and police camera crews photographed the
event.
   ``It's great to be out of here,'' said the third activist, Vusi
Khanyile.
   Valli Moosa and Morobe are senior leaders of the United
Democratic Front, and Khanyile is chairman of the National
Education Crisis Committee. Morobe and Khanyile are black, Valli
Moosa is Indian.
   The front is the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition. The
crisis committee was formed to seek greater black control over
education policies.
   The activists later held a news conference at the nearby
University of the Witwatersrand. Before it began, a television crew
from the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. was subjected
to jeers from the crowd and left at the request of organizers.
   The three men said they would resume their anti-apartheid
activities although they declined to give specifics.
   ``We would like to continue as before, but obviously there are
major constraints,'' said Morobe. ``Our major concern is for other
colleagues in detention.''
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in 1987 after
going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June 12,
1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in 1986.
   They escaped while undergoing physiotherapy at a Johannesburg
hospital.
   Before his detention, Morobe operated from underground as chief
spokesman for the United Democratic Front. One of the UDF's most
eloquent speakers and writers, he played a key role in coveying its
positions at a time when most of its leadership was in jail or in
hiding.
   The activists said they had cordial relations with the U.S.
Consulate staff but were never offered a meeting with U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins.
   ``We would like to interpret it as a snub ... but there may have
been other reasons,'' said Morobe. He said the three did not
request a meeting with Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador in
South Africa.
   In February, the government banned the front and other major
anti-apartheid groups from functioning.
   It is unclear whether the government will allow them to promote
the front's positions freely or whether they will be restricted
again.
   ``We hope the government will react differently this time,''
said Morobe. ``We are eternal optimists.''
   The U.S. Embassy said in a statement: ``The U.S. government did
not negotiate and was not involved in their decision to leave ...
They arrived at their decision after consultations with their
families and advisers.''
   South African officials did not issue a statement.
