   The highly publicized trial of
a white supremacist who killed seven blacks and an Asian could
incite further violence by right-wing extremists, a prominent
newspaper editor said today.
   The warning by Harvey Tyson, editor of The Star of Johannesburg,
followed a week of dramatic testimony in the trial of Barend
Strydom, a 23-year-old former policeman who killed or wounded more
than 20 blacks during a shooting spree on the sidewalks of downtown
Pretoria in November.
   Strydom was convicted of eight counts of murder on Tuesday. Over
the next three days, he and his father outlined their racist views
as part of proceedings to determine whether Strydom should be
sentenced to death.
   Sentencing is expected next week.
   Strydom told the Pretoria Supreme Court that his actions were
justifiable and said he would do the same again if given the
chance. His father, also a former policeman, said he believed
blacks were animals, not humans.
   Both father and son belong to the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement. Fellow members of the group have attended the trial to
show solidarity with the defendant.
   Tyson, whose newspaper is South Africa's largest-selling daily,
said in a column that the extensive local news coverage of the
trial ``bodes ill for a country which has bred so many extremists.''
   ``We may be witnessing an increase in the growth of the
ultra-right's incoherent killing,'' he wrote. ``It seems more than
likely that Barend Strydom's actions could be repeated, not just by
a madman but by sane members of a secret group in our society.''
   Tyson said he had received an anonymous death threat in the mail
last week.
   Police have been investigating Strydom's claims that he belonged
to a clandestine right-wing terror group called the Wit Wolwe
(White Wolves), but senior officers say they doubt such a group
exists.
   A weekly anti-apartheid newspaper, Vyre Weekblad (Free Weekly),
reported Friday that Stydom had handed a letter to one of its
reporters claiming that the Wit Wolwe were responsible for the
``removal'' of David Webster, a white anti-apartheid activist who
was assassinated on May 1.
   The letter also indicated the group was responsible for a recent
bombing that damaged the home of a Parliament member of the
governing National Party.
   In his testimony, Strydom claimed that Wit Wolwe leaders had
instructed him to try to kill Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
the Rev. Allan Boesak, two anti-apartheid church leaders.
   Dozens of activists, almost all of them black, have been slain
in recent years, but in only one case has there been a murder
conviction. Police have made no arrests in connection with
Webster's killing.
   ``It is vitally important that all political killers are brought
to book as quickly as possible,'' Tyson wrote. ``For if justice is
not swift and seen to be impartial, communal insanity will grow.''
