   Authorities have chained,
assaulted and tortured the president of a banned anti-apartheid
youth group during his month-long detention, his lawyers said
Wednesday.
   The allegations were made in an application filed in court on
behalf of Peter Mokaba. The document seeks to restrain police from
alleged assaults and requests that a magistrate and doctor be
allowed to see him.
   The government has confirmed Mokaba's detention under the
Internal Security Act, which does not require that authorities give
a reason. However, the government has said the activist has not
been assaulted while in custody.
   Mokaba, 29, is president of the South African Youth Congress,
one of 17 anti-apartheid groups effectively banned by the
government in February. The leadership of the group, which claims
700,000 members nationwide, is mostly in jail or hiding.
   The group has worked against apartheid, which by South African
law and custom establishes a segregated society in which the 26
million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   The activist had been held in several police stations in
northern Transvaal province since his detention about four weeks
ago, according to lawyers of Cheadle-Thompson, the law firm
representing Mokaba.
   They said his mother has been also been detained since she
accused authorities of torturing her son.
   Their papers were filed at Pretoria Supreme Court. They asked
that a magistrate be assigned to take statements from Mokaba about
his alleged mistreatment. They also asked that he be examined by a
district surgeon.
   Lawyers said a hearing on their application would resume Friday,
when they plan to file an affidavit from Mokaba's mother.
   In another development Wednesday, a black guerrilla freed from a
guarded hospital room by armed colleagues two years ago was
convicted of murder and terrorism.
   Gordon Webster, 24, was recaptured in September when he tried to
return to South Africa from Botswana.
   He was convicted of carrying out several bombings, including one
which killed a police colonel. A bystander was killed when gunmen
burst into Edendale Hospital in May 1986 and freed Webster.
