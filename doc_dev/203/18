  [Excerpt] A series of inconclusive inquiries into political 
violence overseen by Major-General Krappies Engelbrecht will 
come under fresh scrutiny in the next fortnight by a team of 
international investigators appointed by the President F.W. de 
Klerk. The Goldstone commission, which named General 
Engelbrecht as one of three top generals implicated in "Third 
Force" activity, has a mass of new information to put before the 
investigators. This information is expected to throw the 
spotlight on the remarkable record of failure by the SA [South 
African] Police [SAP] to resolve a series of cased of serious 
political violence. 
  As head of SAP's counter-intelligence department, General 
Engelbrecht is in charge of all investigations dealing with 
violence and subversion -- including train, taxi and hostel 
massacres. Before that, he was involved in two major 
investigations into security force involvement in hit squad 
activities. 
  The sequence begins with the allegations of convicted 
murderer Almond Nofomela in 1989 that he and another police 
officer based at Vlakplaas, Dirk Coetzee, had murdered 
anti-apartheid figures. General Engelbrecht was requested to 
assist the McNally commission of inquiry into the allegations. 
Tim McNally later led evidence before the Harms commission, 
which found there was no proof of a state-sanctioned police hit 
squad at Vlakplaas. 
  Then General Engelbrecht was appointed by former Law and 
Order Minister Adriaan Vlok to assist in an investigation of the 
SA Defence Force after claims that the CCB [Civil Cooperation 
Bureau], a covert military organisation, was involved in 
murdering political opponents of the government. He paid 
particular attention to the assassination of Wits academic David 
Webster, allegedly by a CCB hit squad. At the Webster inquest, 
retired police general Jaap Jourbert said General Engelbrecht 
had sent a message to detained murder suspect Ferdi Barnard that 
he should not speak for six or seven months about CCB 
activities. A week before his evidence, the investigating 
officer, Warrant Officer Wessel Rousseau, had told the Rand 
Supreme Court General Engelbrecht had warned two other CCB 
operatives not to talk. They were Calla Botha and Slang van 
Zyl. The inquest court could not make a conclusive finding. The 
Harms commission later found the CCB was not responsible for the 
murder of Dr Webster. 
  General Engelbrecht is one of three generals placed on 
compulsory leave on Friday by Mr de Klerk for allegedly being 
involved in providing arms to Inkatha for hit-squad activities, 
illegally manufacturing weapons, issuing false documents and 
passports, fomenting violence and attempting cover-ups when the 
Goldstone commission began its work. 
  The evidence provided by Mr Justice Richard Goldstone on 
Friday, described as prima facie of criminal action, is only a 
part of the allegations of illegal activities that will be 
provided to a special task team of international policemen. 
Evidence received by the Goldstone commission, but not yet 
disclosed, includes allegations of car theft and corruption in a 
rewards scheme for AK-47 assault rifles and other criminal acts 
by policemen. [passage omitted]
