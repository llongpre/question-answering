   Members of the country's main
guerrilla movement, the African National Congress, are reeling from
a string of setbacks, including revelations of a spy in their midst
and a crackdown on anti-apartheid groups.
   Three guerrillas face a possible trip to the gallows, one leader
was assassinated and a purported informer supposedly photographed
secret guerrilla documents and turned them over to the government.
   Congress leaders acknowledge the setbacks and have acknowledged
that South Africa's nearly 2-year-old state of emergency has
hobbled ANC efforts to undermine white-minority rule.
   During a recent trip to ANC headquarters in Zambia, guerrilla
leaders engaged in ``an orgy of self-criticism,'' according to a
story last week in The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper.
   But it said there remained lingering optimism.
   ``The emergency and the general repression are counterproductive
for the regime,'' ANC official Steve Tshwete was quoted as saying.
``In terms of heightening resentment and mobilizing mass opinion .
.. the situation is favorable for our activities.''
   But the bad news for the congress includes:
   _ The March 29 assassination of guerrilla leader Dulcie
September in Paris.
   _ The April 7 maiming of Albie Sachs, a lawyer and ANC member
who was seriously injured by a car bomb in Mozambique.
   _ The April 15 death of a guerrilla killed when a mine he was
carrying blew up in Pretoria, prompting pro-government newspapers
to claim the group has stooped to using poorly trained ``kamikaze''
bombers.
   In February, the government prohibited political activities by
major anti-apartheid groups. In addition, three ANC members
convicted of murder, terror and treason face possible death
sentences.
   In Messina, near the northern border with Zimbabwe, Mzondileli
Nondula, 25, and Mthetheleli Mncube, 28, are expected to be
sentenced within the next few days.
   Nondula was convicted of killing two white women and four
children who died in a blast when the truck they were riding in
struck a mine. Mncube was convicted of planting a mine that killed
a black man in November 1985 and of killing two white policemen
during a subsequent escape attempt.
   In the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg, Gordon Webster,
24, was convicted of carrying out several bombings, including one
that killed a police colonel.
   At another trial of three alleged ANC members charged with
terrorism and treason, evidence submitted included secret internal
documents, purportedly photographed by a spy, that cited problems
faced by the guerrilla movement because of informers and shortages
of weapons and funds.
   Defense witnesses described Webster as a gentle young man who
joined the congress in a state of despair over racial
discrimination in South Africa, where the system of apartheid
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.
   Taking the stand to plead for his life, Webster professed
loyalty to the congress but voiced some disenchantment.
   Asked what he would do if he could start over again, he replied:
``I would like to be a teacher.''
   Formed as a non-violent civil rights group in 1912, the ANC was
banned in 1960 and a year later began a bombing and sabotage
campaign.
   Its tactics are repudiated by some moderate blacks, but it is
believed capable of winning a national election if restrictions on
black voting rights and political activity were lifted.
