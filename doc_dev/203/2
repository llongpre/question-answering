   An anti-apartheid activist was
assassinated outside his home just days after completing a report
contending death squads are stalking government opponents, his
editor said Tuesday.
   David Webster, a university lecturer, was shot in the chest
Monday by an assailant who fired a shotgun from a passing car,
police said Tuesday. Police spokesman Col. Frans Malherbe said
doctors removed 16 pellets from Webster's body.
   Police offered a $4,000 reward for information leading to the
killers and released sketches of three unidentified white male
suspects.
   Glenn Moss, co-editor of South African Review, said an article
by Webster and a close friend, Maggie Friedman, was to appear in
the political journal's next edition in August.
   ``Assassinations are used as one of the methods of controlling
government opposition when all other methods such as detention or
intimidation have failed,'' the article says. ``It is a very rare
event indeed when such assassinations are ever solved.
   ``The past 12 months have witnessed a steady tempo of
kidnappings and assassinations of anti-apartheid activists ...
carried out by clandestine groups, presumably a death squad.''
   Expressions of sorrow and outrage over the white activist's
slaying came from blacks and whites, and from anti-apartheid,
academic, labor and student groups. Flags were flown at half-staff
Tuesday at the University of the Witwatersrand where Webster, 44,
taught anthropology.
   Max Coleman, who worked with Webster against race
discrimination, told hundreds of mourners at the Johannesburg
campus Monday night: ``There is only one group that stood to gain
from this act: those who are dedicated to perpetuating the brutal
and vicious system that David dedicated his life to opposing.''
   A statement in London from the African National Congress
guerrilla movement said Webster's death is ``the latest in a long
chain of such acts carried out by supporters of the apartheid
regime, determined to silence their opponents by whatever means.''
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions said Webster ``was
not just a sympathizer in our struggle: he was a friend, a comrade,
an active participant.''
   Several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent
years. Many white activists in South Africa receive anonymous
threats. But few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing
of political science lecturer Rick Turner.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said: ``I want to make it
clear on behalf of the government that the murder is strongly
condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to apprehend
those responsible.''
   But South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu said ``I would be
surprised if the assassins are apprehended.''
   In a statement from an Anglican Church meeting in Cyprus, Tutu
said it was ``yet another example of the methods used against those
who stand for justice in South Africa.''
   The South African Council of Churches said Webster's death ``has
tragically demonstrated the vulnerability of anti-apartheid
activists in South Africa, given the fact that those who murder
opponents of the apartheid system are never brought to book.''
   The banned Detainees' Parents Support Committee said of Webster:
``His work went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover
of darkness.''
