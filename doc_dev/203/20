   Three suspected right-wing
terrorists who escaped custody in Namibia had been linked to South
African-based death squads believed to have killed two white
activists, police said Tuesday.
   South Africa's state-run television reported that police were
investigating the possibility the escape may have been arranged by
a far-right group that had drawn up a ``hit list'' of potential
assassination targets.
   The report said five suspected members of the group had been
arrested. It did not identify the organization or give further
details.
   The escapees _ two South Africans and a West German _
overpowered police guards Monday and fled in a car with two
accomplices near Windhoek, Namibia's territorial capital.
   One of the officers, Ricardo van Wyk, was hit in the spine by a
shot from his own revolver, which was seized. He was unconscious in
a Windhoek hospital Tuesday, and doctors said he might be paralyzed.
   The escapees had been charged with murdering a black security
guard in a hand grenade attack on a United Nations office in
northern Namibia in August. South African police said the three
were connected to two former South African police officers held in
the assassinations of David Webster of Johannesburg on May 1 and
Anton Lubowksi of Windhoek on Sept. 12.
   Police have said the ex-officers also have been linked to death
squads, some of which allegedly existed in the national police
force.
   Webster was a university lecturer and human rights advocate.
Lubowski was the only white official of the South-West Africa
People's Organization, the main independence movement in Namibia.
   The grenade attack on the U.N. office in the town of Outjo and
the assassination of Lubowski were the most publicized incidents of
violence during the campaign for U.N.-supervised pre-independence
elections in November.
   SWAPO, which waged a 23-year guerrilla war for independence from
South Africa, won a majority in an assembly that is now drafting a
constitution. Independence is expected by early next year.
   Some right-wing whites accused the U.N. monitoring force of
favoring SWAPO in the election.
   The head of the U.N. contingent, Martti Ahtisaari, said Tuesday
it appeared that arrangements for moving the escapees between their
cells and a courthouse were ``surprisingly lax.''
   The three had been charged with the murder of David Hosaeb, 22,
a private security guard at the U.N. office.
   They were identified as Horst Klenz, 52, of West Germany, and
Darrell Stopforth, 22, and Leonard Veenendal, 23, both South
Africans.
   Veenendal headed the Johannesburg branch of the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, whose members advocate creation of a
whites-only state and often wear khaki uniforms with swastika-style
emblems.
   One of the ex-policemen held in the killing of the white
activists is Ferdinand Barnard, a former detective convicted in
1984 of murdering two drug suspects. The other is Calla Botha, a
well-known rugby player who was a member of the Brixton Murder and
Robbery Squad, the unit investigating the assassinations.
   On Monday, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said police had
made progress in their investigation of South African death squads
believed involved in the slayings.
   The national police force has been criticized widely for its
failure to solve dozens of killings of anti-government activists
since 1978. Opposition groups have demanded the appointment of an
independent judicial commission to conduct the investigations.
