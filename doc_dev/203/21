   Raymond Suttner, a law school
lecturer jailed without charge longer than any other white
activist, was freed Monday after more than two years in detention
but was placed under heavy restrictions.
   Suttner, 43, was detained June 12, 1986, the day that President
P.W. Botha declared a nationwide state of emergency that remains in
effect. Suttner spent much of his detention in solitary confinement
and was allowed a half-hour visit from his brother or sister every
two weeks.
   A restriction order issued by Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok places Suttner under nighttime house arrest and bars him from
any educational facility, effectively preventing him from returning
to his job at the University of the Witwatersrand.
   Vlok said Suttner was being released on ``humanitarian grounds''
because his health had deteriorated in recent weeks. The statement
did not elaborate.
   Suttner, wearing blue jeans and a blue sweatshirt, had a tearful
reunion with his sister and his friends at a Johannesburg house
where he will be required to spend each night. Atop his shoulder
was a small lovebird he had been allowed to keep in his cell at
Pretoria Prison.
   Friends said three months ago Suttner was allowed to keep a
bird, but the first died, and the second escaped, even though its
wings had been clipped.
   His restriction order requires him to report twice daily to the
neighborhood police station, forbids him from leaving Johannesburg
and bars him from giving interviews, according to his lawyers.
   They said Suttner also is barred from working with various
anti-apartheid organizations and cannot have more than four
visitors at his house at one time.
   An estimated 30,000 people, virtually all of them black, have
been detained for varying periods during the emergency.
   The government does not issue comprehensive statistics on
detentions. Last week, it said there were 802 detainees still in
custody who had been held longer than 30 days.
   Suttner, a law lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand
in Johannesburg, served eight years in prison starting in 1975 for
aiding the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   In March 1985, he was elected to the Transvaal Province
executive committee of the United Democratic Front, a non-banned
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   In 1986, he co-authored a book about the Freedom Charter, a
blueprint for a non-racial, post-apartheid South Africa that has
been endorsed by the African National Congress and the United
Democratic Front.
   Suttner was detained at Johannesburg's airport as he was about
to fly to Harare, Zimbabwe, to deliver lectures about the Freedom
Charter and popular justice.
