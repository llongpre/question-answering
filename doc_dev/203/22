   President F.W. de Klerk said
Friday he would not order an independent inquiry into allegations
of police death squads because justice officials could do the job
faster and just as well.
   Several police officers, serving and retired, will be
investigated and five have requested suspension from duty until
investigations or legal proceedings are completed, de Klerk and
Adriaan Vlok, the law and order minister, said in statements
released at 12:01 a.m.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said two former security
policemen whose allegations prompted the inquiry would be
prosecuted. One awaits execution for a non-political murder and the
other has fled the country.
   ``The government has full confidence that the tried and
respected prosecution mechanisms of the state will be sufficient to
bring the accused before the court, impartially and objectively,''
de Klerk in response to demands that the investigation be conducted
outside the law enforcement establishment.
   ``A judicial inquiry can take months, if not years, to reach its
final conclusions,'' he said. ``In the meanwhile, a climate of
suspicion and distrust could develop, something the country can ill
afford at this stage in its history.''
   South Africa's national police have been criticized for failing
to solve dozens of killings of anti-government activists since
1978. Anti-apartheid leaders say many people believe security
personnel help plan, participate in, or cover up such actions.
   Three former security policemen have said in recent newspaper
interviews or sworn affidavits that they participated in death
squad operations on orders of superiors, many of whom still occupy
high positions in the police.
   The former policemen, two black and one white, said they were
involved in bombings, arson, kidnapping, robbery and murder in
South Africa and neighboring countries.
   One, Almond Nofomela, is awaiting execution. The others have
fled, but one is reported held by authorities in Botswana.
   Vlok's statement about what would be investigated mentioned only
Nofomela's allegations. He said ``a team of senior detectives''
would work with the attorneys general of Natal and Transvaal
provinces.
   The South African Council of Churches demanded access Thursday
to camps where police say former African National Congress
guerrillas are held when they agree to join the police.
   One former policemen who fled, ex-Capt. Dirk Coetzee, said the
death squads recruited such former guerrillas.
   Police identified five Afrikaner men Thursday who were arrested
in connection with an alleged far-right group suspected of planning
attacks on anti-apartheid activists. The men, all from the
Johannesburg area, range in age from 24 to 41, and were arrested
Tuesday.
   Police say the men are believed to be part of a group that broke
with the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   A report in the Citizen newspaper said police were investigating
the possibility that extremists had murdered black civilians as
practice for future attacks on political targets.
   It said all five men were former members of the paramilitary
bodyguard that protected Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the
Afrikaner Resistance Movement, and he was on a ``hit list'' found
when they were arrested.
   Police are said to be investigating possible connections between
the five men and two other cases.
   In one, two former policemen are held in Johannesburg for
questioning about the assassinations of university academic David
Webster and Namibian lawyer Anton Lubowski.
   In the other, three men escaped this week from police custody
while being transported from a Namibian court, where they faced
murder charges for a grenade attack on an office of the U.N.
observers monitoring the territory's transition to independence.
