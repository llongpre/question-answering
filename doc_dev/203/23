   The government's decision to
extend the state of emergency for a third year means continued
detention without trial for some of the country's most articulate
and effective anti-apartheid leaders.
   Many of the estimated 2,500 people detained under emergency
regulations are black activists known only in their own
communities. But scores of others formed the core of leadership of
nationwide anti-apartheid groups like the now-restricted United
Democratic Front.
   Those still in detention include:
   _Zwelakhe Sisulu, 37, editor of the New Nation, a weekly
newspaper closed by the government three months ago. Sisulu, who
was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, was detained in December
1986. His father is jailed African National Congress leader Walter
Sisulu. His mother, Albertina, is co-president of the United
Democratic Front and has been banned from speaking publicly.
   _Raymond Suttner, 42, a law school lecturer at Johannesburg's
University of the Witwatersrand and the only white emergency
detainee held for two years. Suttner served eight years in prison
starting in 1975 for aiding the outlawed African National Congress.
He co-authored a book about the Freedom Charter, a blueprint for a
non-racial, post-apartheid South Africa that has been endorsed by
the ANC and the UDF. Friends say he has spent much of his detention
in solitary confinement.
   _Henry Fazzie, 64, and Mkhuseli Jack, 30, UDF leaders from Port
Elizabeth who helped organize effective black consumer boycotts of
white-owned stores in 1985 and 1986. They were detained in August
1986. Fazzie's wife, Beauty, also is in detention, as are many
other UDF leaders from the area.
   _Vusi Khanyile, 37, chairman of the National Education Crisis
Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher and student groups
seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum and policies in
their schools. The committee was instrumental in calling off
classroom boycotts that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the
government outlawed its later campaign for ``people's education.''
Khanyile was detained in December 1986 and nearly all other top
leaders of the crisis committee have been detained since then.
   _Murphy Morobe, 32, acting publicity secretary of the UDF, who
was detained in July 1987. Between the 1986 emergency declaration
and his detention, Morobe operated from underground, wearing
disguises and showing up unannounced at newspaper offices. He is
considered one of the UDF's most eloquent writers and speakers.
   _Ivy Gcina, 51, leader of the UDF-affiliated Port Elizabeth
Women's Organization, detained for the entire emergency. Employed
as a cleaning woman at a school, she had five children _ including
one killed in unrest and three who have fled the country.
   _Brian Sokutu, a Port Elizabeth-based free-lance journalist,
held for the entire emergency.
