   A South African court Monday
sentenced a member of the African National Congress to 25 years in
prison for murder and terrorism.
   Gordon Webster, 24, was convicted by the Pietermaritzburg
Supreme Court of bombing several electrical transformers. One
bombing killed a police colonel.
   Webster's case drew widespread attention when armed colleagues
freed him from a guarded hospital room in May 1986. Webster was
recaptured last September after he planned to take hostages in a
bid to free one of his rescuers, who by that time was awaiting
execution.
   In the highly publicized trial, which ended on Monday, defense
witnesses described Webster as a gentle young man who joined the
guerrilla group in a state of despair over racial discrimination in
South Africa.
   ``Sometimes I wished I could be white,'' Webster said.
``Sometimes I was angry for having color, for what I was _ black.''
   The prosecution said Webster joined the ANC willingly and was
aware that the organization waged a bombing and sabotage campaign.
   The congress, based in Lusaka, Zambia, is the main black group
fighting to overthrow the government of South Africa and end
apartheid.
   The judge and two assessors handling the case said they agreed
on the 25-year sentence after considering the extenuating
circumstances in the case. They said Webster's impoverished
upbringing and skin color caused him difficulties as a youth. They
also said Webster had not intended to kill people when he planted
bombs.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
