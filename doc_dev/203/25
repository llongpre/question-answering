   Stompie Seipei, the 14-year-old
activist allegedly murdered by Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was
buried Saturday and eulogized as a youth who gave up his childhood
to fight for freedom.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, was not mentioned by name during the funeral service.
   Some anti-apartheid leaders have renounced her since Seipei's
death, but speakers at the funeral urged reconciliation.
   About 500 mourners packed into a Roman Catholic church in
Tumahole, the township where Seipei, at age 10, became commander of
an army of militant boys who agitated against apartheid.
   They sang songs of freedom, raised clenched fists and chanted
their loyalty to the ANC guerrilla movement and to Mandela, the
country's best-known black leader.
   The Rev. Peter Storey, leader of the Methodist Church in the
Johannesburg region, blamed apartheid for Seipei's death.
   ``What have we done in this country, that a child who should have
been chattering in a classroom or playing marbles in his backyard
should have become a 14-year-old general with the tired eyes of an
old man?'' asked Storey, a white.
   The number of mourners swelled to about 1,000 as chanting,
singing youths ran ahead of the hearse to the cemetery where Seipei
was buried.
   Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer
club, in December allegedly abducted Seipei and three young men
staying at a Methodist Church sanctuary in Soweto, the township
outside Johannesburg.
   The victims allegedly were taken to Mrs. Mandela's home and
beaten.
   Police say Seipei's decomposed body was found in a Soweto field
Jan. 7.
   The three others implicated Mandela United members in their
abduction, and two team members and the club's bus driver were
arrested last week in connection with Seipei's slaying.
   Two other murders also have been linked to Mandela United.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied any knowledge of Seipei's death but has
said the youths were taken from the church because they were being
sexually abused by a white minister, the Rev. Paul Verryn. Methodist
officials have said the allegations are false, and Verryn attended
Saturday's funeral.
   Speakers at the service indicated Seipei's killers may have
thought incorrectly that he was a police informer.
   During the 32-month-old state of emergency imposed by the South
African government to quell unrest in black townships, police often
have restricted the size and duration of funerals for slain
activists.
   No restrictions were imposed on Seipei's funeral, however, and
speakers suggested that authorities were trying to exploit his death
to deepen divisions in the black community.
   ``We shouldn't point fingers at other people, because Stompie was
interested in unity,'' said McLean Skosane, a local anti-apartheid
leader. ``Don't let his death divide us.''
   Leading anti-apartheid groups have accused Mandela United of
terrorizing Soweto residents and for months asked Mrs. Mandela to
disband the group, which lived at her home. She refused the request
until last week.
   Police searched her home Monday and said they found blood on
walls and weapons including clubs and a knife.
   She has called the actions by police and anti-apartheid activists
a plot to discredit her.
   Seipei became an anti-apartheid leader at age 10, when he and a
friend formed the ``Under Fourteens'' in Tumahole, about 60 miles
southwest of Johannesburg.
   More than 1,000 youths served under Seipei and challenged police
and pro-government vigilantes during the height of township unrest
in 1985-86.
   ``The other groups were all talk and no action,'' the youth told
a British journalist in 1987.
   Seipei was detained for the first time when he was 11 and became
the youngest person held under emergency regulations. He learned to
play chess in detention and tried to keep up with studies that were
interrupted when he left primary school in 1986.
   In 1987, he addressed an anti-apartheid meeting at Johannesburg's
University of the Witwatersrand, enthralling his audience and
earning a luncheon invitation from the university's vice chancellor.
