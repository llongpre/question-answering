<HEAD>THE ACTIVISTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Murphy Morobe, 32, is acting publicity secretary of the United
Democratic Front and was detained in July 1987. Married, with two
children, he went underground after a state of emergency was
declared on June 12, 1986. During the next 13 months, he remained
active, often showing up unannounced and in disguise at newspaper
offices to give interviews or deliver press releases. He is
considered one of his group's most articulate speakers and writers.
He was imprisoned from 1977 to 1982 after he and other black
student activists from Soweto were convicted of sedition.
   _Mohammed Valli Moosa, 31, is acting general secretary of the
United Democratic Front. He and Morobe, who were detained together,
assumed their positions in 1985 after their predecessors were
arrested on treason charges in a case still pending in court.
   Valli Moosa, of Indian descent, was born in Johannesburg, but
his family was forced to move to a segregated, Asian suburb in 1964
under the terms of South Africa's Group Areas Act. He is married
and has one daughter. Prior to his detention, he visited Europe,
the United States and Canada on behalf of the United Democratic
Front.
   _Vusi Khanyile, 37, is chairman of the National Education Crisis
Committee and also was special assistant to the chief administrator
of the University of Cape Town. He is married, with three children.
He became involved in black student politics in 1972, and was
detained for five months in 1977-78. He received a bachelor's
degree in 1982 from the University of Birmingham in Britain.

<HEAD>THE ORGANIZATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The United Democratic Front was founded in 1983, primarily to
oppose a new constitution that brought Asians and people of
mixed-race into Parliament while continuing to exclude the black
majority. The front quickly established itself as the largest
anti-apartheid group in the country, a loose coalition of about 700
labor, civic, church and educational groups which up to 2.5.
million members. Most of the estimated 30,000 people detained for
varying periods since the 1986 emergency declaration have been
affiliated to the United Democratic Front, and the organization was
banned in February from conducting any activities.
   _The National Education Crisis Committee, also banned in
February, was formed in December 1985. Like the United Democratic
Front, it is a multiracial but predominantly black coalition. It is
composed primarily of parent, teacher and student groups seeking to
give blacks more control over curriculum and policies in their
schools. The committee was instrumental in calling off black
classroom boycotts that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the
government outlawed its subsequent campaign for ``people's
education'' and has detained virtually all its leaders.
