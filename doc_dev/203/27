   Thousands of people
marched through this city to the police headquarters Friday to
protest apartheid and police suppression.
   The independent South African Press Association estimated 20,000
people joined the procession, led by clergymen, while scores of
policemen watched. No violence was reported during the march, which
had received official permission from a magistrate.
   Organizers claimed it was the biggest march since the funeral
procession for Steve Biko, founder of the black consciousness
movement who died in 1977 while in police custody.
   Also Friday, a man convicted in the murder of a schoolteacher
was executed despite an appeal for mercy by the United Nations.
   The Justice Department said Mangena Jeffrey Boesman, 36, a black
member of the outlawed African National Congress, was hanged. He
was convicted in the 1985 killing of Mellina Fass, a black teacher
who apparently defied a school boycott called by anti-apartheid
militants.
   Mrs. Fass, who was in her 50s, was a victim of a ``necklace''
murder _ killed by having a gasoline-soaked tire placed around her
neck and set afire.
   Dozens of blacks considered collaborators with the white
government were killed by the ``necklace'' method from 1984 to 1986.
   The U.N. General Assembly, by a vote of 149-0 Thursday, called
on South Africa to commute the death sentence of Boesman and all
other ``political prisoners.''
   The United States and Britain abstained. U.S. Ambassador Thomas
R. Pickering said, ``There can be no circumstances in which a
violent murder such as the one in this case ... could be considered
a rightful political act.'' There have been 39 executions in South
Africa this year, far fewer than in recent years when more than 100
people were hanged annually. More than 200 people, mostly black
men, remain on death row.
   About 40 prisoners have had their death sentences commuted this
year and are serving prison terms.
   There have been anti-apartheid marches in cities throughout the
country since the Sept. 6 elections. Most have been peaceful, but
police used batons and dogs to stop women from marching in Pretoria
last Saturday because they did not have permission.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told a police parade in the
northern Transvaal town of Hammanskraal on Friday that police had
``no option but to act to curb illegal demonstrations'' such as the
Pretoria march.
   The marches involve the parliamentary elections that excluded
the black majority.
   Anti-apartheid activists say that 23 people were killed in
election-day violence instigated by police. Officials initially
denied responsibility for any deaths but police opened an
investigation and recently said 19 people were killed, including 10
who died in black-vs.-black factional fighting and nine in
incidents where police may have been involved.
   One of the leaders of the defiance campaign, Mohammed Valli
Moosa, was released Friday after being held for 42 days without
charge. He was placed under heavy resrictions.
   Valli Moosa, an official of the banned United Democratic Front,
was one of three activists who escaped from detention last year and
took sanctuary at the U.S. consulate in Johannesburg. The three
left the consulate after the government said they would not be
arrested.
   But police seized Valli Moosa in his Johannesburg office on Aug.
18, days before the United Democratic Front and other organizations
declared they would ignore the banning orders.
   Vlok signed the release order for Valli Moosa. It prohibits him
from being in the company of more than seven other people for any
purpose, talking to the news media, leaving Johannesburg, taking
part in United Democratic Front or Transvaal Indian Congress
activities, preparing anything for publication or leaving his home
at night.
