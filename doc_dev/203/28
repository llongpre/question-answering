   Five long-exiled leaders of the
African National Congress made an emotional return to South Africa
on Friday to prepare for groundbreaking talks next week with the
white-led government.
   The five, who arrived from the group's exile headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia, will join ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela for
discussions with President F.W. de Klerk's government May 2-4.
   ``As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 27 years
ago, `We are really on the way,''' said Joe Slovo, a member of the
ANC's National Executive Committee. He fled South Africa in 1963.
   ``We who left by the back door ... have now entered the very
front door of South Africa,'' said Slovo, the ANC's highest-ranking
white. ``It's a remarkable feeling.''
   In addition to Slovo, the group included the ANC's
secretary-general, Alfred Nzo; head of foreign affairs, Thabo
Mbeki; commander of the movement's guerrilla wing, Joe Modise; and
head of the women's section, Ruth Mompati.
   The five, who had been in exile since the 1960s, arrived on a
private charter and held an airport news conference.
   ``It is an exciting moment for all of us,'' said Nzo.
``Regrettably, our South Africa is still a bleeding country ravaged
by the apartheid system which continues to divide our people into
warring clusters.''
   Mbeki wept as he stood beside his 80-year-old father, Govan
Mbeki, an ANC veteran who spent 23 years in prison before his
release in 1987.
   About 100 supporters greeted the ANC leaders at the airport.
Hundreds more lined the road outside, waving the banners of the ANC
and its ally, the South African Communist Party.
   Meanwhile, exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo, 73, quietly left
Sweden on Thursday after a recuperating there since Jan. 3 from a
stroke he suffered late last year, officials in Stockholm said
Friday.
   The Swedish news agency TT said Tambo wanted to return to South
Africa soon, but it was unlikely he would be able to resume an
active leadership role in the ANC.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC in February after a 30-year ban. Many
of the estimated 15,000 members in exile are likely to return this
year. Four lesser-ranking ANC officials returned this week but have
not appeared in public.
   The government promised that the exiled ANC leaders would not be
prosecuted upon returning to South Africa for the talks.
   Under South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation, the
country's 5 million whites maintain political and economic control,
and the 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.
   Next week's talks are designed to clear the way for negotiations
on a new constitution that would include blacks.
   The ANC has said the government must lift the 3{-year-old state
of emergency and release prisoners convicted of politically
motivated crimes before negotiations can begin. The government
wants the ANC to renounce its armed struggle.
   The government has said constitutional negotiations will include
several black opposition groups in addition to the ANC.
   Slovo is general secretary of the Communist Party. About half of
the ANC's top 35 leaders also are Communists.
   In other developments:
   _Police said Friday six people were killed in black factional
fighting in Natal Province during the preceding 24 hours.
   _Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said he plans to introduce
legislation that would end racial segregation of prisons.
   _A former member of the Johannesburg City Council security
department alleged that a military intelligence operative was
responsible for the assassination last year of prominent white
anti-apartheid activist David Webster.
   Hannes Gouws made his allegation at an inquiry into a spy ring
conducted by the city council. No one has been arrested for
Webster's killing.
