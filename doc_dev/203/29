   Thousands of people of all
races marched at a peaceful anti-apartheid demonstration today in
this seaside city, possibly the largest-ever authorized protest in
South Africa.
   Among the marchers were the white managing director of the
Mercedes-Benz auto manufacturing plant in East London and many of
the company's black employees, who were given the day off to
participate.
   The rally for ``justice, peace and freedom'' was organized by 20
local anti-aparthied groups as part of a nationwide protest
campaign launched in early August. The demonstrations have targeted
segregated schools, hospitals, beaches, buses and other facilities.
   Police estimated today's crowd at between 25,000 and 40,000, and
journalists at the scene gave similar estimates.
   The largest previous government-approved rally was a march in
downtown Cape Town two weeks ago by an estimated 20,000 to 25,000
people.
   In other developments, authorities released a prominent
anti-apartheid activist who had been on a hunger strike, and the
city of Johannesburg formally opened all public facitilies to
blacks.
   There have been a series of mass demonstrations across the
country since President F.W. de Klerk announced Sept. 13 that
authorities would not break up lawful, peaceful protests.
   The East London rally was led by David Russell, the Anglican
Archbishop of Grahamstown, along with other local clerics and human
rights lawyers.
   The rally clogged the entire downtown area and most shops closed
for the day. Marchers danced, chanted and sang freedom songs, and
some carried the green, gold and black flag of the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Leaders of the rally marched to the headquarters of the security
police and presented written demands that call for the release of
political prisoners, the legalization of banned opposition groups
and the lifting of the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   There was a heavy police presence at the rally, including
armored vehicles and a helicopter, but officers stood aside and no
incidents were reported.
   All the approved mass rallies in the past two weeks have been
peaceful except for some minor looting at a march last week in the
southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg. In Pretoria, police used
clubs Saturday to disperse some women trying to proceed with a
protest march that was not authorized.
   In Johannesburg, white students at Rand Afrikaans University
jeered and heckled about 200 black students who marched today to
protest the segregated dormitories. About 75 percent of the
students at the overwhelmingly white university voted last week to
maintain segregated residences, the black students said.
   In another development, authorities released a prominent
anti-apartheid activist who went on a hunger strike after being
detained without charge last month, his attorney said.
   Trevor Manuel, who was freed Tuesday, is one of the top-ranking
leaders in Cape Town of the banned United Democratic Front, the
country's largest anti-apartheid coalition.
   Manuel, who has been detained previously, was held in the
central city of Bloemfontein and refused to eat for two weeks of
his 30-day confinement, attorney Essa Moosa said.
   Before his most recent detention, Manuel was under police
restrictions that limited his movements. Moosa said he did not know
if any new restrictions had been placed on his client.
   Many activists have ignored the police orders as part of the
nationwide defiance campaign.
   The government released hundreds of detainees earlier this year
after they launched a hunger strike, and only a few dozen were
being held without charge in June and July.
   However, a human rights groups estimate that the number has
risen to about 250. More than 30,000 people have been detained
without charge for varying lengths of time under the 3-year-old
state of emergency.
   In Johannesburg, meanwhile, the city formally opened all public
facilities to blacks today after the city council voted to
desegregate buses, swimming pools and recreation centers.
