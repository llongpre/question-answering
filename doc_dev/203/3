   Colleagues of slain
anti-apartheid activist David Webster today offered a reward for
the arrest of his killers and advised police officials to look
within their own ranks for suspects.
   Webster, a university lecturer and outspoken critic of the
government's policy of detention without trial, was shot outside
his home Monday by an assailant in a passing car who fired a
shotgun from close range.
   Also today, six mortar bombs were fired at an army radar
installation near the border with Botswana, damaging living
quarters but causing no injuries.
   Regarding Webster, police have released sketches of three
unidentified white men suspected of involvement in the killing and
have offered a $4,000 reward for information leading to arrests.
   Today, the University of the Witwatersand, where Webster taught
anthropology, offered an additional $4,000 reward. Robert
Charleton, the chief administrator of the multiracial university,
said it was ``deeply disquieting'' that police had made no arrests
in connection with a series of previous attacks and vandalism aimed
at staff and students.
   Anti-apartheid activists who worked with Webster announced at a
news conference that his funeral would held Saturday.
   Max Coleman, a prominent human rights advocate, called for an
investigation into the possible existence of death squads formed to
kill government opponents.
   ``There may be no more profitable place to start such an
investigation than within the ranks of the police themselves,''
Coleman said. ``This is the body which has the expertise, the
information and the wherewithal to carry out such acts so
professionally.''
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, a leader of the banned United Democratic
Front anti-apartheid coalition, told the news conference that
Webster ``was a very carefully chosen target.''
   ``His cold-blooded murder is meant to serve as a warning to the
increasing numbers of whites who are daring to associate themselves
in word and deed with the oppressed people of this country,'' Valli
Moosa said. ``We fear that more and more of our leaders are going
to be assassinated.''
   ``The ordinary people of this country have a strong suspicion
that Comrade Webster's assassin is a member of the police force,''
he added.
   Webster was an authority on the tactics used legally and
illegally to repress or intimidate government opponents. He
recently completed an article discussing unsolved abductions and
assassinations of anti-apartheid activists.
   Numerous black activists have been slain in recent years. Many
white activists have received anonymous threats or have been
harassed but few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing
of Rick Turner, a political scientist at the University of Natal.
   In north-central South Africa, security forces set off a land
mine while trying to catch those who fired the mortar bombs at the
radar installation, but the detonation of the mine caused no
injuries, the military said.
   It said the radar installation was near Mafikeng near the
Botswana border.
   There was no immediate indication who was responsible.
   There have been few attacks on army bases, and very few mortar
bombardments during the 28-year-old guerrilla campaign waged by the
outlawed African National Congress. South African officials have
contended that ANC guerrillas often infiltrate from Botswana to
carry out bombing and sabotage missions.
