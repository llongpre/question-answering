   Three escaped anti-apartheid
activists holed up in the U.S. Consulate for five weeks plan to
``call the state's bluff'' and emerge from their refuge Wednesday.
   The activists disclosed their decision Tuesday after advice was
relayed to them from jailed black leader Nelson Mandela. The three
previously had said they mistrusted the government's pledge to let
them leave the consulate without being redetained.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, said Monday she discussed the activists
when she met Saturday with her husband, who is recovering from
tuberculosis at a hospital in Cape Town. Mrs. Mandela said she
passed on unspecified suggestions from her husband to the escapees'
lawyers.
   The three activists _ prominent leaders of banned opposition
groups _ have been living in a meeting room at the consulate on the
11th floor of a Johannesburg office building since their escape
Sept. 13.
   The government has said the men are free to leave and will not
be detained again or restricted.
   ``The three have called the state's bluff and intend to leave
... to claim their freedom,'' said a statement issued on their
behalf by the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest
anti-apartheid group not banned from functioning.
   The activists' decision ``is a major test of the government's
undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on the
detention and persecution of anti-apartheid activists,'' said the
congress, the main black labor federation.
   The three activists are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa,
senior leaders of the United Democratic Front, and Vusi Khanyile,
chairman of the National Education Crisis Committee.
   All had been held more than a year without charge when they
slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a
Johannesburg hospital. Morobe and Khanyile are black, Valli Moosa
is Indian.
   ``If the state detains or restricts them, it will deepen the
credibility problems of the apartheid regime,'' the congress'
statement said. ``Government repression has not, and will not,
succeed in destroying the strength and mass support of the
democratic movement.''
   U.S. officials have said they would not force the three to leave
despite a policy of not allowing diplomatic premises to be used by
asylum seekers.
   U.S. officials have maintained a low profile during the episode
and the embassy issued no statement Tuesday. The South African
government also had no immediate comment.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the 28-month-old state of emergency. About
1,000 people are in detention, according to anti-apartheid groups.
   The three escapees have demanded the release of all detainees
and protesting the policy of indefinite detention without trial,
which they described as a form of torture.
   Colleagues of the three criticized U.S. officials for barring
the men from direct contact with the news media.
   An activist who escaped to the consulate Sept. 21, Clifford
Ngcobo, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment. His
lawyers had allege he was tortured while in custody.
