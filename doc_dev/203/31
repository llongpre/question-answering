   Black activist Winnie Mandela
said today U.S. officials have imposed restrictions on three
anti-apartheid leaders holed up in the U.S. Consulate since their
escape from detention last week.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, commented after visiting the three men at the
consulate in a Johannesburg office building.
   She said U.S. officials in Washington were refusing to let the
three communicate directly with the news media, a condition which
they initially agreed to but now want to change. ``We would like to
see the Americans a little more committed than they are,'' she said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, Barry Walkley, said his government was
concerned with the well-being of the activists ``and at the same
time with maintaining the appropriate posture of a diplomatic
mission.''
   ``Establishing a media forum is incompatable with either the
concept of temporary refuge or the functioning of a diplomatic
mission,'' he said.
   ``We agreed that they can convey messages through their legal
representatives. However, using their legal representatives as
intermediaries for interviews goes beyond that agreement.''
   Elsewhere, 11 activists reportedly were detained under
state-of-emergency regulations in Cape Town, where a national
anti-apartheid conference is planned this weekend. In the port city
of Durban, police said 160 people were arrested after hundreds of
striking black dockworkers went on strike.
   Encamped at the U.S. Consulate are two leaders of the banned
United Democratic Front _ Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa _
and the chairman of the banned National Education Crisis Committee,
Vusi Khanyile. They slipped away from guards Sept. 13 at a
Johannesburg hospital.
   They have remained at the consulate despite a government promise
that they will not be arrested or restricted if they leave, and
have called for the release of all political detainees.
   Mrs. Mandela said the three are wary because of a threat by
South African authorities immediately after their escape. She said
the government said it would take ``the most severe measures''
against the men unless they agreed to leave the country.
   Lawyer Essa Moosa said activists taken away from their homes
today included Trevor Manuel, 32, Cape Town leader of the United
Democratic Front. Manuel was detained without charge in August 1986
and was placed under severe restrictions when released in July.
   The detained activists reportedly included at least two whites,
an Indian, several blacks and people of mixed-race.
   Police declined to confirm the detentions, but did report on the
Durban dock strike. According to police, the arrests in Durban came
after strikers, many of them carrying sticks and pipes, staged an
illegal gathering.
   The strike began Tuesday to protest the dismissal of a worker
and to demand higher pay.
   Initial reports from lawyers and relatives indicated nine
activists were detained in Cape Town. But Frank Meintjies of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions said 11 United Democratic
Front activists were detained.
   The anti-apartheid conference is to be held Saturday and Sunday
at the University of Cape Town and is sponsored by the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, the country's largest labor federation.
   Organizers are seeking to bring together about 75 opposition
groups, ranging from white, liberal Parliament members to
organizations that advocate black self-reliance.
   ``This is not a conference of people who necessarily agree on
everything,'' Meintjies said. ``But they all agree that the
apartheid problem should be done away with once and for all.''
Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about security force actions and treatment of detainees,
but enforcement of the rules has not been comprehensive.
