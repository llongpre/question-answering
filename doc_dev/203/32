   Three prominent anti-apartheid
activists, detained for more than a year without charge, escaped
from a hospital Tuesday and took refuge at the U.S. Consulate in a
high-rise office building.
   The U.S. Embassy said it had ``high regard'' for the men and
would not force them to leave against their will.
   Two of the three are senior officials of the now-banned United
Democratic Front _ acting publicity secretary Murphy Morobe, a
black, and acting general secretary Mohammed Valli Moosa, an
Indian. The other is Vusi Khanyile, a black who was chairman of the
banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   The U.S. Embassy statement confirmed that the three had taken
refuge at the consulate, on the 11th floor of an office building in
downtown Johannesburg. The building is two miles from the hospital
where they were being treated.
   The main U.S. embassy is in Pretoria.
   Several associates of the escapees later met with U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins and they said he assured them the men
would be well cared for.
   The three have asked to meet with their relatives and with
leaders of the anti-apartheid movement, but they have not disclosed
any other requests.
   ``We were in frequent contact with these three men prior to
their detention without charge, and hold them in high regard,'' the
U.S. statement said. ``We will not press them to leave against
their will.''
   The statement said the United States does not offer asylum at
its diplomatic offices. But it said these premises are inviolable
under international law and may not be entered by the host
government without consent. The embassy said it was discussing the
situation with the activists and the South African government.
   Jay Naidoo, an anti-apartheid labor leader, said he and several
colleagues including Max Coleman conferred with Perkins, America's
first black ambassador to South Africa, and they were assured the
escapees' physical needs would be cared for. Coleman said of the
three, ``They're very pleased to be where they are.''
   Brig. Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry,
said the men had escaped from Johannesburg Hospital, where they had
been receiving physiotherapy. No details of the escape were
disclosed.
   Previously, the three had been at Johannesburg's Diepkloof
Prison.
   At the consulate, there was no visible sign of security force
deployments. A private guard stood at the entrance while about two
dozen journalists waited in the hall for several hours before
dispersing.
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in July 1987
after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June
12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in December 1986.
   Between the emergency declaration and his detention, Morobe
operated from underground, wearing disguises and showing up
unannounced at newspaper offices.
   As one of the United Democratic Front's most eloquent writers
and speakers, he played a key role in conveying the positions of
the nation's largest anti-apartheid group, at a time when most of
its leaders were in jail or in hiding.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge at
some point during the emergency. The government has not released
comprehensive statistics, but it said recently that 802 people who
had been held at least 30 days were still in custody.
   Many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated
to the United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of more than
600 anti-apartheid groups.
   Also detained were virtually all top leaders of the National
Education Crisis Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher and
student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum
and policies in their schools.
   The committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts
that spread nationwide in 1985-86. But when it subsequently
campaigned for ``people's education,'' the government outlawed it.
   The United Democratic Front and the crisis committee were among
17 anti-apartheid organizations banned in February from conducting
any activities. The U.S. government was among many to condemn these
bannings.
   Twice in recent years, activists have taken refuge at diplomatic
missions in South Africa. Six United Democratic Front leaders
stayed at the British Consulate in Durban for several weeks in late
1984 before emerging to face arrest for high treason. The charges
later were withdrawn.
   In September 1987, South Africa agreed to let a Dutchman, Klaus
de Jonge, return to the Netherlands after being holed up at a Dutch
Embassy office in Pretoria for two years.
   De Jonge escaped into the office from police custody after being
arrested for aiding the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
