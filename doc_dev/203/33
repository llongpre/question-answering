   Three escaped detainees
encamped in the U.S. Consulate for more than a month plan to leave
their sanctuary Wednesday, an anti-apartheid labor federation said
today.
   The three prominent activists, who escaped detention Sept. 13,
have been living in the consulate on the 11th floor of a downtown
Johannesburg office building.
   The South African government has said the trio is free to leave
and it will not redetain or restrict the men in any way.
   The decision for the men to leave ``is a major test of the
government's undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on
the detention and persecution of anti-apartheid activists,'' the
Congress of South African Trade Unions said in a staement.
   The congress is the country's largest black labor organization
and is a militant opponent of apartheid.
   The anti-apartheid leaders are Murphy Morobe and Mohanned Valli
Moosa, leaders of the banned United Democratic Front coalition, and
Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned National Education Crisis
Committee.
   Morobe and Khanyile are black, Valli Moosa is of Indian descent.
   All had been held more than a year without charge when they
slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a
Johannesburg hospital.
   ``The three have called the state's bluff and intend to leave,''
the congress statement said.
   ``We do not for a moment believe that the government intended
releasing them and that they somehow pre-empted this by their
escape,'' it added. ``This government line was meant to appease the
U.S. administration and dilute public and international concern
over detentions.''
   U.S. officials have said they would not force the three to leave
despite a worldwide U.S. policy of not allowing diplomatic offices
to be used by those seeking asylum.
   U.S. officials have maintained a low profile during the episode
and U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis said he had no immediate
comment on the matter.
   Earlier the activists had said they do not trust the government
and repeated their call for the release of other political
detainees.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without trial for
varying lengths of time under the 28-month-old state of emergency.
About 1,000 people currently are believed to be in detention. Most
are being held for political activism.
   An activist who escaped Sept. 21 to the U.S. Consulate, Clifford
Ngcobo, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment, his
law firm said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
