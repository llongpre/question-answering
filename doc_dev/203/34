   A shooting attack that killed a
13-year-old girl at her Soweto home may be linked to the controversy
surrounding Winnie Mandela, police said Thursday.
   The killing Wednesday night was the fourth in two months
involving people connected to Mrs. Mandela and her unofficial
bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer club.
   Mrs. Mandela's husband, jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, met for more than four hours Thursday with three
anti-apartheid lawyers at a prison farm near Cape Town. One of the
lawyers, Dullah Omar, said no details of the discussions would be
disclosed.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied media speculation that her 30-year
marriage is in jeopardy because of her estrangement from major
anti-apartheid groups.
   Last week, leading anti-apartheid activists accused Mandela
United members of conducting a ``reign of terror'' in the vast black
township outside Johannesburg and said Mrs. Mandela should be
ostracized.
   Police said the Soweto girl, whose name was withheld, was killed
when gunmen fired on her house with AK-47 rifles and set the
dwelling aflame with a firebomb.
   A few hours before the attack, a woman living in the house was
detained in connection with the stabbing death last week of Maxwell
Madondo, a member of the soccer club. Plice declined to identify the
arrested woman.
   ``The possibility that the attack on the house may have a bearing
on the murder of Mr. Madondo and is possibly a revenge attack is
being investigated,'' police said.
   Madondo's body was found near the house that was firebombed. A
former soccer club member, Andrew Ekaneng, has been charged in the
killing.
   Two other people with links to Mrs. Mandela and her bodyguards
have been slain recently in Soweto.
   Stompie Seipei, a 14-year-old activist, was allegedly beaten at
the Mandela home by Mandela United members. His decomposed body was
found in January. Two members of the soccer club have been charged
in the slaying and the abduction and assault of three men.
   Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, an activist, was killed at his Soweto clinic
last month. Two men have been charged in the shooting death, and
police have said they believe the motive was robbery. However, Mrs.
Mandela has suggested Asvat may have been killed because he had
examined Seipei and other youths who she said were sexually molested
by a Methodist minister in Soweto.
   The Rev. Peter Storey, the senior Methodist official for the
Johannesburg-Soweto region, on Thursday reiterated the church's
denial of the sex allegations.
   ``The church particularly resents recent suggestions that it is
involved in a conspiracy with the police to frame the Mandela United
soccer team,'' he said.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied complicity in any wrongdoing, has
suggested that Seipei is still alive, and has asserted the
controversy results from a campaign to discredit her.
   In another development, police banned a rally Thursday intended
to show solidarity with black detainees who have staged hunger
strikes to protest being held without charge.
   More than 300 people, mostly students, had gathered in an
auditorium at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg
when police officers entered the hall and said the meeting had been
banned.
   Student leaders, faculty members and administrators from at least
five universities have fasted in support of the hunger strikers.
   Hundreds of detainees have gone on hunger strikes at several
prisons across the country over the past four weeks to demand that
the government free them or charge them.
