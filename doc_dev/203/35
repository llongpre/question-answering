   Three psychics and a $50,000 reward didn't work.
In the end, it was a veterinarian walking her dog who found the
bones of a Harvard student who vanished in 1981.
   The discovery of the remains of Joan Webster also renewed
questions about the role of the infamous Leonard ``The Quahog''
Paradiso, a small-time hood doing time for another slaying.
   Paradiso never was charged in the Webster case, in which Essex
County District Attorney Kevin Burke said he ``became a suspect
almost immediately'' after Webster disappeared from Logan
International Airport.
   The case was revived after veterinarian Karen Wolf last month
stumbled across part of a skull in the woods in Hamilton, a wealthy
community 25 miles north of Boston.
   More bones were found after that.
   Confirmation that the remains were Webster's was made Monday.
Authorities said the cause of death was ``blunt trauma to the
head,'' and that Webster was a homicide victim.
   ``That is some measure of relief,'' George Webster said of the
identification. He said he and his wife, Terry, had long believed
their daughter had been slain.
   Joan Webster was last seen at the airport on Nov. 28, 1981. The
native of Glen Ridge, N.J., and Syracuse University graduate was
headed back to the Harvard's School of Design after a Thanksgiving
visit with her parents.
   Webster was a successful and active student who had made the
dean's list at Syracuse. She liked skiing, sailing, tennis and
photography and had traveled widely, her parents said.
   The search for Webster turned up her wallet 300 feet from where
20-year-old Marie Ianuzzi's body was dumped in 1979 in Saugus.
Saugus is 15 miles from where the bones were found. Paradiso was
convicted of Ianuzzi's murder in 1984.
   After Webster vanished, her family and friends offered a $50,000
reward. Shortly after the disappearance, three psychics came
forward, including one who said he envisioned her body was in a
pond in Manchester, about five miles from where her bones were
later found.
   ``It was close,'' said Beverly Police Capt. Gordon Richards, who
was among the investigators in 1982.
   In 1985, attention focused on Paradiso after a former cellmate
alleged that the one-time fish merchant claimed involvement in
killing Webster.
   Timothy Burke, who was Suffolk County prosecutor at the time,
said in an affidavit that Paradiso told an informant he forced
Webster onto his 26-foot cabin cruiser, the Malafemmina _ Italian
for ``bad woman'' _ with a fake .357-caliber Magnum.
   According to the account, he hit her on the head with a whiskey
bottle and dumped her body in Boston Harbor.
   Many people now want to talk to Paradiso, 45, formerly from
Revere.
   Paradiso, who has defended himself in the media in the past, is
not talking much. He did not return a phone call Tuesday, and a
spokesman for the Department of Correction said the Walpole inmate
refuses to speak to reporters.
   It could not be immediately determined if he was currently being
represented by an attorney. His convictions include rape and
attempted murder of a hitchhiker in 1975, as well as the
strangulation of Ianuzzi in 1979.
   He was also found guilty on federal bankruptcy fraud charges for
claiming to be worth $10 when he was working at a lobster company
and had $10,000 in the bank.
   When the prison informant linked him to Webster's disappearance,
Paradiso denied the allegations. He protested his innocence in
writing to newspapers, the district attorney, police and even
Webster's parents.
   ``Now do you think a high-class smart girl like Joan Webster
from a good family, with money, is going to get into a car with a
guy like me smelling of fish?'' he told a newspaper six years ago.
   He sued Boston magazine for $3 million, saying he was libeled in
a story linking him to the Webster case. That suit was dismissed in
1987 by a judge who said Paradiso's reputation was so bad he was
``libel-proof.''
   Kevin Burke, the Essex County prosecutor, indicated Paradiso
wasn't ruled out even though finding the bones in the woods seems
to discount the Boston Harbor theory.
   Shards of metal and glass stuck in Paradiso's index finger,
thought to be part of the fake gun, became the subject of a
protracted and much publicized legal battle over the inmate's right
to keep the contents of his injured finger secret. He underwent
forced surgery but it yielded no new evidence.
