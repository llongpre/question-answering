   President F.W. de Klerk on
Thursday accepted a proposal by the African National Congress to
send a delegation for the first formal talks between the white
government and its foremost adversary.
   The ANC's commitment to dialogue ``is a positive step,''
reflecting a desire to ``search for solutions through peaceful
means,'' said de Klerk, who lifted a 30-year ban on the guerrilla
movement three weeks ago.
   De Klerk also made his first public statement on a controversy
involving Defense Minister Magnus Malan, who has been linked in
press reports to a secret military unit that allegedly assassinated
anti-apartheid activists.
   The president, interviewed by the state-run TV network, said the
allegations would be thoroughly investigated by a judicial
commission, criticized the press for conducting a ``trial by
media,'' and praised the role of the security forces in saving
South Africa from ``anarchy and chaos.''
   Opposition political leaders demanded Malan's resignation and
urged de Klerk to ensure that no cover-up takes place.
   Malan, in statements this week, denied having ordered
assassinations, but did not rule out the possibility the unit may
have committed such acts. He pledged the military would not
interfere with any investigations.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg quoted sources as saying
Malan had been aware of the unit at least since 1987.
   Police investigators have said in court papers that members of
the unit, called the Civil Cooperation Bureau, are suspected of
involvement in the assassinations last year of David Webster, a
Johannesburg human rights activist, and Anton Lubowksi, a civil
rights lawyer and pro-independence activist in Namibia.
   De Klerk last month ordered a judicial inquiry into charges that
military and police squads murdered government opponents. The
commission is expected to investigate the unsolved killings of at
least 60 activists in the past decade.
   Three former policemen have confessed to serving on death
squads. Several active police officers are under investigation.
   The activists allegedly killed by the death squads include
members and supporters of the ANC.
   Although it was legalized Feb. 2 as part of de Klerk's peace
initiative, the ANC says its guerrilla campaign remains one of its
tactics in trying to pressure the government to end white-minority
domination.
   On Feb. 16, the ANC said from its headquarters in Zambia that it
would send a delegation to South Africa to confer with de Klerk
about obstacles in the way of negotiations on a new constitution.
   The ANC says the state of emergency must be lifted and all
political prisoners freed before such talks can start. Its office
in London released a list Thursday of more than 750 prisoners it
said should be freed.
   No date for the preliminary meeting has been set. De Klerk said
the government would first have to address ``legal uncertainties''
regarding exiled ANC leaders who might be liable for prosecution in
South Africa.
   Earlier Thursday, the government said de Klerk had postponed a
meeting scheduled for Saturday in Zaire with leaders of some black
African nations. The ANC had urged a boycott of the meeting, saying
de Klerk's reforms had not gone far enough.
   While welcoming the ANC's decision to pursue talks, de Klerk
said it was ``disappointing that the ANC leadership continues to
talk about an armed struggle and hostilities at a time when most
South Africans, supported by the rest of the world, want peace.''
   The government ``is committed to a new dispensation which offers
peace and justice for all,'' de Klerk said. ``An armed struggle and
hostilities do no fit into this pattern.''
   Recently freed ANC leader Nelson Mandela helped launch the
guerrilla campaign in 1961, a year after the group was outlawed.
The bombing and sabotage campaign has been ineffectual in the past
year and poses little threat to the government.
   In the port city of Durban, leaders of the ANC and a more
conservative rival movement, Inkatha, opened their first
head-to-head peace talks Thursday, seeking to halt a power struggle
that has killed more than 3,000 people.
   ANC leader Walter Sisulu, arriving for the closed-door talks,
said blacks in Natal Province were ``preparing themselves for
peace'' after three years of savage factional warfare.
   Mandela is expected to appeal for reconciliation when he
addresses a mass rally in Durban on Sunday.
   Sisulu, one of Mandela's closest associates, joined an ANC
delegation that met black community leaders from around
Pietermaritzburg, one of the worst-hit areas.
   The group then returned to Durban to meet an Inkatha delegation
headed by Oscar Dhlomo, second-in-command under Zulu politician
Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Both groups depict themselves as foes of apartheid, but Inkatha
rejects the ANC's use of violence and opposes confrontational
protest tactics. The ANC favors a socialist-oriented economy, while
Inkatha favors free enterprise.
