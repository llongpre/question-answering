   Three anti-apartheid leaders
who escaped to the U.S. Consulate 36 days ago emerged from their
refuge today to test the government's claim that they are free men.
   The activists said Nelson Mandela, serving a life prison term
for his anti-apartheid activities, advised them to leave the
consulate. They pledged to resume anti-apartheid work.
   The government says it will not detain the men again. They had
been jailed without charge more a year when they slipped away from
police guards and fled to the consulate Sept. 13.
   The three _ Murphy Morobe and Mohanned Valli Moosa, leaders of
the United Democratic Front coalition, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman
of the National Education Crisis Committee _ had been living in a
consular meeting room on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office
building.
   The men grinned broadly as they embraced their families and
colleagues waiting in the lobby of the building. They gave
clenched-fist salutes to cheering supporters, mostly young blacks,
who chanted ``Viva!'' and ``Amandla!'' which means ``power'' in
Zulu language.
   Riot police with truncheons and shotguns were deployed. Officers
sought to keep the crowd under control and police camera crews
filmed the event.
   ``It's great to be out of here,'' said Khanyile.
   ``It is not without apprehension that we have left the
consulate,'' Valli Moosa said at a news conference later.
``Notwithstanding the government's assurances, we realize that we
could be redetained or given harsh banning orders.''
   Valli Moosa said the three were influenced by advice from
Mandela, a black leader who is recuperating from tuberculosis at a
Cape Town clinic.
   ``The view of comrade Nelson Mandela was that we should leave
the consulate as soon as possible, and that assisted us in our
decision to leave,'' Valli Moosa said. He said the advice was
passed to the three by Mandela's wife, Winnie.
   The United Democratic Front is the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition. The crisis committee, a front affiliate,
was formed to seek greater black control over education policies.
Both groups were banned in February, along with scores of other
organizations opposed to apartheid.
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in July 1987
after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June
12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in December 1986.
   The activists said they had cordial relations with the U.S.
Consulate staff but were never offered a meeting with U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins.
   ``We would like to interpret it as a snub... but there may have
been other reasons,'' said Morobe. He said the three did not
request a meeting with Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador in
South Africa.
   U.S. officials said they would not force the three to leave
despite a U.S. policy of not allowing diplomatic offices to be used
by those seeking asylum.
   About 30,000 people have been detained without trial for varying
lengths of time under the 28-month-old state of emergency. About
1,000 people currently are believed to be in detention. Most are
being held for political activism.
   An activist who escaped Sept. 21 to the U.S. Consulate, Clifford
Ngcobo, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment. His
lawyers had alleged he was tortured while in custody.
   Between the emergency declaration and his detention, Morobe
operated from underground as chief spokesman for the United
Democratic Front. One of the front's most eloquent speakers and
writers, he played a key role in coveying its positions at a time
when most of its leadership was in jail or in hiding.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   It was unclear whether the government will allow the three
activists to promote their positions freely or whether they will be
restricted in some manner.
