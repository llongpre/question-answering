   Threats of violent resistance
to even cautious reform of race policies are becoming reality, and a
showdown appears imminent between the government and white
extremists.
   In the latest incident Nov. 15, a white gunman opened fire on
blacks at random in downtown Pretoria, fatally wounding seven
people. Authorities arrested Barend Strydom, a 23-year-old former
policeman linked to the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   President P.W. Botha's government, which warned extremist groups
previously, responded by banning the White Liberation Movement, a
small group that has held a few public rallies in the past year. It
is the first white extremist group ever banned in South Africa.
   The White Liberation Movement advocates ``clearing out'' blacks
living in white urban areas. The government described its members as
``fanatical right-wing extremists (who) favor an active form of
violence to take racism to its extreme.''
   Johan Schabort, a biochemist who formed the group in 1985, said
banning it reduces the ``outlet for frustration of white South
Africans.''
   ``Now we cannot control people who are worried about their race
survival,'' said Schabort, who claims about 1,000 members and many
more sypathizers.
   Although no white extremist organizations had been banned, the
government has declared 23 anti-apartheid groups illegal and
detained or restricted hundreds of black activists this year alone.
   Right-wing white groups have increased in both numbers and
prominence in recent years as the National Party government
implemented gradual race reforms and proposed limited power-sharing
with blacks.
   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs, and the official apartheid policy of race discrimination
preserves power and privilege for the 5 million whites.
   Officials did not say why they acted only against the White
Liberation Movement, which is much smaller than the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement led by Eugene TerreBlanche.
   TerreBlanche has built his organization into the largest of the
far right. Nearly all its members are Afrikaners, the descendants of
white settlers who dominate the government.
   Thousands of rural and blue-collar whites attend the movement's
rallies, at which TerreBlanche delivers spellbinding speeches about
an all-white state and rejects any concessions to the black majority.
   Despite repeated threats, the government has not yet acted
against the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, possibly because of worry
about its vow of violent resistance to any reduction of white
privilege.
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said recently: ``There are whites in
this country who can put together a more efficient violent
organization than the African National Congress,'' the main
guerrilla group fighting white domination.
   Asked why the government does not detain whites as often as black
anti-apartheid activists, he said: ``It is not a question of
arresting a few people and that's the end of it.''
   The government portrays itself as a haven of stability in the
increasingly militant struggle by blacks and extremist whites.
   About 170 bombings have occurred since a nationwide state of
emergency was imposed June 12, 1986. Officials have blamed most of
them on the African National Congress, but the targets of several
recent explosions have been anti-apartheid groups.
   ``There should be no doubt that right-wing violence is quite as
evil and destructive as that of the left,'' the government-run South
African Broadcasting Corp. said in a recent editorial.
   Black activists have raised the possibility of involvement by
government security forces in attacks on anti-apartheid activists
and organizations.
   After receiving several death threats in March, the Rev. Allan
Boesak said many anti-apartheid leaders ``have been assassinated in
South Africa. I want the world to know the light of suspicion should
fall on the South African government and the police if something
should happen.''
   Police often boast of their success in capturing ANC guerrillas
and pre-empting their attacks, but have announced no progress in
recent cases of violence widely blamed on white extremists.
   Among them: A bomb destroyed a Johannesburg building that housed
several anti-apartheid groups, fire damaged offices of
anti-apartheid church groups in Pretoria, a bomb exploded in a
Johannesburg disco frequented almost exclusively by blacks and a
fire was set in an anti-apartheid group's offices at the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
   The Conservative Party, which opposes all concessions to blacks,
split from the National Party in 1982 and now is the largest
opposition in Parliament. Some of its Parliament members belong to
the TerreBlanche's organization.
   Other groups preaching an all-white homeland are the Boerestaat
Party and the Orangeworkers.
   Hercules Booysen, chairman of the Orangeworkers, said of the
action against the White Liberation Movement: ``The government will
keep on banning organizations until only itself is left.''
