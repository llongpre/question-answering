   Members of the United Democratic
Front and seven other banned anti-apartheid groups unfurled their
banners at a cathedral Sunday and declared they would defy
government emergency laws by operating openly again.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu led a multi-racial congregation
of 2,500 in chanting, ``No to apartheid, no to injustice, no to
oppression and no to racism,'' at the church service, which replaced
a planned rally at the mixed-race University of the Western Cape.
Police prevented that rally from taking place.
   The declarations by the anti-apartheid groups, some of which took
place in Johannesburg, are part of a national defiance campaign
organized to coincide with the sixth birthday of the 700-group
United Democratic Front anti-apartheid coalition.
   They aim to challenge the government in the weeks before the
Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, which exclude the black majority.
   Organizers in Cape Town obtained a last-minute Supreme Court
order forbidding police from interfering with the rally at the
cathedral.
   But a similar rally in Johannesburg, also banned, was thwarted
when police blockaded main entrances to the white University of the
Witwatersrand. About 200 protesters slipped through and held a rally
addressed by little-known spokesmen who refused to identify
themselves but declared the United Democratic Front and five
affiliate organizations ``unbanned.''
   After the Johannesburg rally ended, about 50 black youths chanted
and danced on the campus lawn until police moved in with batons and
dispersed them. The independent South African Press Association
quoted an unidentified foreign diplomat as saying police injured
several of the youths and arrested about 20.
   Sources close to anti-apartheid leaders said many of those in
Johannesburg had gone into hiding Friday after police detained
Mohammed Valli Moosa, acting general secretary of the United
Democratic Front, under emergency regulations that allow them to
hold a suspect indefinitely without charge.
   Valli Moosa was a principal organizer of the defiance campaign,
which involves challenges to segregation at beaches, hospitals, in
parks, buses and schools.
   A mobile emergency medical clinic was on standby outside the
cathedral in case of injuries from police action, but because of the
court order the police remained two blocks away, sitting in parked
vans. However, they set up a roadblock on the main highway into Cape
Town and stopped a busload of people from attending the rally.
   Police also prevented students from leaving the campus of the
University of the Western Cape.
   Referring to a police attack Saturday on hundreds of blacks
attempting to picnic on whites-only Cape peninsula beaches, Tutu
said: ``They say apartheid is dead. It is one of the most
extraordinary corpses around.
   ``They had police, dogs and tear gas to stop people from walking
on God's beaches. I have never been more proud of people who are
involved in the struggle for justice and freedom in this country
than yesterday. It is our country and we are claiming what is
ours,'' he said.
   The banner of each organization was unfurled as the group was
pronounced ``unbanned.''
   Zoli Malindi, leader of the United Democratic Front in western
Cape province, defied restrictions which prohibit him from
addressing a gathering. He declared:
   ``The United Democratic Front is unbanned and will continue as if
it has never been banned.''
   Representatives of the organizations, holding the banners aloft,
marched outside the church and then dispersed after the 2{-hour
service.
