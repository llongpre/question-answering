   Attackers firing from a
passing car today shot and killed anti-apartheid activist David
Webster outside his home, friends said.
   Police confirmed a white man was killed in a shooting incident
at Webster's home in the Johannesburg neighborhood of Troyeville
but declined to release other details.
   Webster, 44, was a lecturer in social anthropology at the
University of the Witwatersrand and a prominent member of several
anti-apartheid organizations. He led campaigns against the
government's policy of detention without trial.
   Glenda, his former wife, told the independent South African
Press Association that Webster was opening the back door of a van
when shots were fired by men in a car. She said he had just
returned from buying plants at a nursery.
   Audrey Coleman, a colleague of Webster's and a fellow activist,
said she was certain the killing was politically motivated.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, a former detainee now serving as
unofficial spokesman for major anti-apartheid groups, said in a
statement: ``We are deeply shocked by this blatant assassination of
our dear comrade ...
   ``We are concerned that his death comes as a result of
unflinching opposition to the system of apartheid,'' Valli Moosa
said of South Africa's policy of legal race discrimination. ``The
only beneficiaries of his death are those who have an interest in
perpetuating this evil system.''
