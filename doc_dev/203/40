   The last participant in a
hunger strike has resumed eating, ending a protest that helped win
freedom for hundreds of black inmates who were held without charge,
a human rights group said today.
   The Human Rights Commission said the last known hunger striker,
Zelile Zwane, began eating Thursday after being taken to court and
charged with various offenses, including illegal weapons possession
and attempted murder.
   Like the other hunger strikers, many of them anti-apartheid
activists held since 1986, he had demanded the government either
release him or charge him.
   The government said this week that less than 100 people remained
in custody under emergency regulations allowing indefinite
detention without trial. About 1,000 were held in late January,
when hundreds of detainees began fasting in prisons across the
country.
   ``We see what happened as a great victory for detainees,'' said
Audrey Coleman, a member of the Human Rights Commission. ``Through
their united action, they were able to expose the whole system of
detention without trial.''
   However, the commission and civil rights lawyers issued angry
protests today because of reports that former hunger strikers had
been shackled to their beds while recuperating at Johannesburg
Hospital.
   The National Medical and Dental Association, an organization of
anti-apartheid health care professionals, said Thursday that at
least two detainees had been shackled to prevent escapes. Since
September, there have been at least four escapes from hospitals by
detainees receiving treatment.
   Police headquarters declined comment on the use of shackles at
the hospital but said departmental policy allowed such measures.
   The Human Rights Commission says a majority of detainees freed
in recent weeks have been issued with restriction orders. Many of
them are barred from certain political activities, confined to
their homes at night and required to report to a police station
twice daily.
   One former detainee, Chris Ntuli, was killed by unidentified
assailants last week after making his required appearance at a
police station in a black shantytown outside Durban. Civil rights
groups suggested the killers were right-wing vigilantes who were
able to predict Ntuli's movements because of the restrictions.
   Black activists in the Durban area today called for residents to
stay away from work and school in conjunction with a memorial
service for Ntuli. There were unconfirmed reports that two buses
were fire-bombed and that a milk truck was set on fire, killing the
driver.
   The Weekly Mail, a leading anti-apartheid newspaper, reported
today that the decision to free most detainees was made by the
Cabinet against the wishes of the State Security Council, which
includes senior military and intelligence officials as well as a
few Cabinet ministers.
   The Weekly Mail quoted Mark Swilling, a Johannesburg-based
political scientist, as saying it was the first time the security
council was overruled in the 11 years since President P.W. Botha
took power.
