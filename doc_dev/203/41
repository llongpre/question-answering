   Police used tear gas and clubs
today against activists supporting a boycott of Wednesday's
nationwide elections for segregated municipal councils. Archbishop
Desmond Tutu called for an Election Day fast and appealed to all
sides to avoid violence.
   A bomb exploded today in Potchefstroom, southwest of
Johannesburg, extensively damaging a shopping center and slightly
injuring a policeman, police headquarters said.
   It was the second bombing in as many days and police said the
attacks are part of a campaign by the African National Congress
black guerrilla movement to disrupt the elections. On Monday, a car
bombing in Witbank, east of Johannesburg, killed two people and
injured 42.
   In Zwide, near Port Elizabeth, a black candidate was shot and
killed at his home late Monday by an unidentified assailant, a
local newspaper reported.
   Near Cape Town, more than 30 mixed-race high school students
were injured today in a clash with club-wielding police after they
protested the elections, a school official said.
   At Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, more than
1,000 people staged an anti-election rally. Many of them, including
black activist Winnie Mandela, marched to a campus gate where riot
police ordered them to disperse, then fired tear gas.
   Police said officers were being deployed throughout the country
to guard polling stations.
   The Human Rights Commission, a group opposing apartheid, said in
a report today that the elections ``are taking place under a
blanket of silence generated by the repression of anti-apartheid
activists.''
   The commission said about 300 activists had been detained
without charge since Sept. 1, most of them in connection with the
election campaign. The commission also alleged that authorities
were coercing large numbers of blacks into voting.
   Tutu said those who wish to vote, as well as those who boycott,
``should be free to exercise their choice without intimidation.
   ``I want to make an urgent call for a peaceful response to the
elections,'' the Anglican archbiship said in a statement from
church headquarters in Cape Town.
   ``I call on the government not to provoke violence during the
polling and on all those involved in responding to the elections,
whether supporting or opposing them, not to allow intimidation,''
he said.
   Tutu, along with other black anti-apartheid leaders, have been
calling for a national day of protest and a boycott of the
ballotting for segregated municipal councils.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, called for fasting
and prayer but said the he and other anti-apartheid leaders were
not necessarily calling for a general strike.
   Since a state of emergency was declared in 1986, it has been
illegal to call for nationwide strikes.
   The elections mark the first time South Africans of all races
vote at the same time. The white minority government has spent
millions of dollars on advertising to encourage a high black
turnout, seeking support for its claims that it is extending
democracy to blacks even though it denies them a vote in national
elections.
   There are about 5 million whites and 26 million blacks in South
Africa. Roughly half the blacks live in self-governing homelands
not involved in the local elections.
   Critics say black turnout figures this year will be virtually
meaningless because millions of blacks are ineligible to vote and
because no candidates linked to major anti-apartheid groups are
running. Many opposition groups are banned, and most activists view
black town councils as subservient extensions of the
white-controlled central government.
   In the white elections, attention is focused on a showdown
between President P.W. Botha's National Party and the far-right
Conservative Party, which seeks to strengthen segregation laws.
   White anti-apartheid candidates are active in only a few cities.
Their most important battleground is Johannesburg, where they are
underdogs against the National Party in a fight for control of the
city council.
