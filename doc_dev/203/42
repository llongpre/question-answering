   A sit-in by three prominent anti-apartheid activists at the U.S. consulate here ended yesterday, but their standoff with the South African government has just begun. 

   The trio of United Democratic Front leaders emerged from the consulate at noon, challenging the government to keep its word that it won't re-detain or restrict them. 
The three had been holed up in a consulate office since Sept. 13, when they escaped from the police after lengthy detentions. 
Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, both senior UDF executives, were detained in July 1987, and Vusi Khanyile, the chairman of the National Education Crisis Committee, a UDF affiliate, was detained in December 1986. 

   Since their detentions, the government has banned the UDF and has severely restricted most of the organization's prominent members who weren't already in jail. 
It is unlikely that the government will let these three go totally unshackled -- they have vowed to continue their opposition to apartheid and to press for the release of hundreds of other political detainees -- but any move against them now would likely heighten the tension inside the country and prompt an international outcry as well. 

   The government is trying to improve its image abroad. 
It has seriously pursued talks aimed at bringing peace to Angola and independence to neighboring Namibia, which South Africa has controlled in defiance of a United Nations resolution. 
At the same time, President P.W. Botha has embarked on a diplomatic offensive designed to improve ties to black Africa. 

   At a press conference shortly after they left the consulate, the three said they turned down a government offer to go into exile. 
They said they will return to the black community to resume their work as activists "because we believe we have a duty to do," Mr. Morobe said. 

   "It is not without apprehension that we have left the consulate," Mr. Valli Moosa said. 
"Notwithstanding the government's assurances, we realize that we could be redetained or given harsh banning orders." 

   The three said they decided to leave the consulate on the advice of Nelson Mandela, indicating that the 70-year-old leader of the outlawed African National Congress still has a hand in guiding the opposition movement after 24 years in prison. 
Mr. Mandela, who is currently recovering from tuberculosis at a guarded clinic near Cape Town, met with his wife, Winnie, over the weekend and sent a message to the trio. 

   "We had asked Mr. Mandela for his advice on what we should do," said Mr. Valli Moosa, who was only seven years old when Mr. Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government. 
His advice, Mr. Valli Moosa said, was that the three, through their escape and sit-in, had made their point about the government's practice of detention without trial and that they should leave the consulate as soon as possible and return to anti-apartheid work. 

   During their 36-day stay in the consulate, the three held almost-constant consultations with anti-apartheid leaders who dropped by to visit them. 
At the press conference, they gave few details of their escape, and when asked why they chose the American consulate, Mr. Morobe joked, "We know of only two superpowers in the world and, of course, the one doesn't have an embassy in South Africa." 
The Soviet Union doesn't have diplomatic ties with this country. 

   At first, American diplomats here privately expressed delight that the three had chosen the U.S. consulate, saying that it proved that the U.S. still had good ties with the black opposition despite the general impression among South African blacks that the Reagan administration has been too friendly with Pretoria. 
But by the end of their stay, relations had soured. 

   Anti-apartheid activists were upset that the Americans prohibited the three from making any statements to the press during their sit-in, and the three seemed somewhat offended that there hadn't been a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins.
