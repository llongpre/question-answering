   Prominent black activists went
into hiding as police on Monday continued to crack down on a
campaign to defy apartheid laws and emergency restrictions.
   Students at three Natal province universities defied police
banning orders and held rallies to declare outlawed student
organizations would operate openly. Eight students were held briefly
and six were charged with attending illegal gatherings.
   Several hundred sturdents at each university clashed with police
who came to the campuses to halt the rallies, part of a national
campaign to disregard banning orders placed on organizations during
the 3-year-old national emergency.
   Police fired tear gas and turned a water cannon on students and
staff at the multiracial University of Natal-Durban, after a crowd
of more than 1,000 refused several orders to disperse. A student
leader shouting over a megaphone declared the End Conscription
Campaign and the South African National Students Congress
``unbanned'' as he ran from squads of police scattering the crowd.
   Students at the white University of Natal-Pietermaritzburg
encountered police when they marched off-campus with placards
proclaiming the two organizations ``unbanned.'' Police also
disrupted a rally at the mostly-Indian University of
Durban-Westville, where students danced and chanted in celebration
of the ``unbanning.''
   ``The past few days have been marked by a systematic pattern of
repression by the state against the defiance campaign,'' said Cas
Coovadia of the banned United Democratic Front, the country's
largest opposition coalition.
   ``The detention of our leaders and the banning of our meetings
serves to strengthen our spirit of resistance,'' Coovadia said in a
statement. He added that he had gone into hiding, but did not name
any others who had done so.
   There have been reports of several activists dissapearing since
Friday when police arrested Mohhamed Valli Moosa, the acting
secretary-general of the United Democratic Front and a chief
organizer of the defiance campaign. He was held under emergency
regulations that allow police to keep him in custody infefinitely
without charge.
   Leon Mellet, spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry, indirectly
confirmed that activists were hiding. ``It is ironic that they unban
themselves and then immediately go underground,'' he said.
   He said ``a number'' of people who had defied the law had been
arrested and ``when they sit alone in a police cell, they must blame
those faceless people who irresponsibly urged them to defy the law.''
   The defiance campaign which began Aug. 2 has been escalating in
the days leading up to Sept. 6 parliamentary elections that exclude
the 28 million-member black majority.
   Police responded by breaking up several weekend anti-apartheid
rallies, including a march by blacks at a ``whites-only'' beach at
Cape Town and a demonstration at the University of the Witwatersrand
in Johannesburg. The chairman of the Johannesburg rally said major
speakers from the UDF had not arrived Sunday because they were in
hiding.
   Police said an ``unsatisfactorily high'' number of unrest
incidents had occurred over the weekend in the Cape Town area, and
that police would continue to use whatever action neccessary to curb
such protests.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu condemned the police use of
whips, dogs, and tear gas to keep blacks off the beaches Saturday.
   ``In my experience it is the police who have been creating
`unrest.' Whenever they keep away from an event, it goes off
peacefully. Whenever they arrive with their quirts, tear gas and
firearms and try to prevent people from peacefully expressing their
dissent, they precipitate confrontation and violence,'' he said.
