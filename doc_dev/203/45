<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Lawyer Wounded In Car Bombing</HEAD>

   A white South African lawyer who was
jailed for anti-apartheid activities in the 1960s was seriously
wounded Thursday when a bomb exploded in his car, Mozambique's
official news agency reported.
   Albie Sachs's right hand was nearly severed from his arm in the
blast, which occurred as he opened his car door outside his
apartment in downtown Maputo, the agency said.
   Sachs was in very serious condition after an operation, hospital
sources told AIM.
   The news agency said a 33-year-old Mozambican man, Ishmael Nagib
Mussagy, suffered a serious head wound from bits of metal flying
from the booby-trapped car, and the man's 3-year-old son was
slightly injured.
   Sachs, a member of the African National Congress guerrilla
group, was jailed by South African authorities for more than three
months without charge in 1963. He also defended members of the
anti-apartheid group, which was banned in 1960.
   He was one of the few white people who participated in the
congress' 1960 defiance campaign, which urged people to ignore
apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested.
   Sachs left South Africa in 1963 after being released from jail.
He wrote a book about his experiences, ``The Prison Diary of Albie
Sachs,'' which was turned into a play in Britain.
   He worked in Britain before going to Mozambique, where he
lectured at the national university in Maputo until recently. He
works for the Justice Ministry in the capital, AIM said.
   Tom Lodge, a political scientist at Johannesburg's University of
the Witwatersrand and South Africa's foremost expert on the ANC,
said Sachs was not working for the ANC in Mozambique and was not an
officer in the organization, which is made up mostly of blacks.
   The attack is the latest in a series carried out against African
National Congress members outside South Africa. At least six ANC
members have been killed outside the country this year.
   South Africa has denied responsibility for the deaths, although
it repeatedly warns it will cross its borders in pursuit of ANC
members.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which
South Africa's blacks have no vote in national afairs. The whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.
