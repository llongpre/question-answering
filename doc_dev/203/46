   The government on Thursday
banned a national anti-apartheid conference planned for this
weekend, and a fourth activist took refuge in the U.S. Consulate
after escaping from detention.
   Organizers had depicted the Cape Town conference as one of the
most important anti-apartheid gatherings in 30 years. More than 70
groups, with members ranging from black militants to liberal white
Parliament members, had planned to discuss strategies for
countering repression of dissent.
   The ban was part of a crackdown on opposition.
   Earlier Thursday, authorities backed off in the case of the
latest escape by a detainee, who joined three other anti-apartheid
activists holed up at the U.S. Consulate. Police issued, then
withdrew an arrest warrant for Clifford Ngcobo, who escaped
Wednesday while being treated at a hospital and fled to the
11th-floor consulate in a downtown Johannesburg office building.
   Consular officials allowed Ngcobo to remain while his case is
assessed, U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis said. The consular
officials earlier provided refuge for three prominent activists who
escaped Sept. 13.
   Zavis said he could not confirm reports that the consulate
turned away a fifth fugitive Wednesday night. Local news reports
said a black man sought by police was refused entry into the
consulate and later was taken into custody under security
legislation.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington
Thursday that the South Africans given refuge agreed not to have
contact with news media as a condition of their staying. This was
so the consulate could continue normal operations and avoid
activities incompatible with diplomatic activity, he said.
   Black activist Winnie Mandela visited the consulate Wednesday
and complained that U.S. officials would not let the detainees
contact reporters.
   Police pledged not to arrest the three initial escapees if they
leave the consulate, but Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
confirmed that a multipronged crackdown against other activists is
under way.
   Across South Africa, more than two dozen activists were detained
or barred from political activities this week, offices of
anti-apartheid groups were raided, and pedestrians and motorists in
urban centers were subjected to random searches.
   Brig. Leon Mellet, spokesman for Vlok, announced the conference
ban. He said one goal of the conference was to promote disruption
of upcoming nationwide municipal elections.
   Activists advocate a boycott of the elections, saying the
segregated black council seats at stake are components of a
white-controlled system that excludes blacks from central
government.
   Mellet said participants in the conference were sympathetic to
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement and were
seeking to fill the vaccuum created by the banning in February of
17 major anti-apartheid groups. The groups included the United
Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition.
   The crackdown comes during an upsurge of bombings, including
five in a 9-hour span late Wednesday and early Thursday.
Authorities said 38 people were injured, including 18 whites at a
Johannesburg bus terminal and 19 blacks at a disco on the other
side of the city.
   The disco owner said three white men left shortly before the
blast without drinking their beer.
   Police have blamed most recent bombings on the ANC. But
activists believe right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force
unit carried out the recent bombing of a Johannesburg building used
by anti-apartheid groups.
   Redman said of Ngcobo: ``He indicates that he is a member of the
United Democratic Front and had been in detention for five months
prior to his escape. He is now in temporary refuge with the three
other ... activists.''
   The three are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, leaders of
the UDF, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned National
Education Crisis Committee.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
