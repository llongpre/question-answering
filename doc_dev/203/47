   The government said Wednesday
that three anti-apartheid leaders holed up in the U.S. Consulate
after escaping detention are free men and will not be rearrested.
   But the lawyer for the trio, who were jailed up to 21 months
without trial, said he received no official word of the
government's stance and gave no indication what his clients planned
to do.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the three were ``not in any
danger of being arrested once they leave the consulate.'' Police
said they would have to issue new orders to detain the men again
but that they have no plans to do so.
   The activists slipped away from their police guards Tuesday
while undergoing physiotherapy at a hospital and made their way to
the consulate in a downtown office building.
   ``We sought refuge in the U.S. Consulate because we failed to
see any justification for our continued detention without trial,''
the three said in the statement. ``We have now resorted to the only
dignified response to our continued incarceration.''
   The escapees are Murphy Morobe, acting publicity secretary of
the banned United Democratic Front, Mohammed Valli Moosa, the
front's acting general secretary, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of
the banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   Morobe, detained without trial since July 1987, and Khanyile,
detained since December 1986, are black. Valli Moosa, an Indian,
was arrested with Morobe.
   The trio, in a statement released by their lawyer, Krish Naidoo,
called for an end to the 27-month state of emergency and demanded
``the right to walk out of this consulate free of any restrictions,
or the threat of redetention.''
   Naidoo said his clients had not received word of the
government's offer. He said he did not know how the activists would
respond if they received a formal offer of unconditional freedom.
   Naidoo, who met with the men Wednesday, said they gave no
indication that they want to leave South Africa.
   The trio, who also met with family members, were staying in one
small room, but they had a television, videocassette recorder and
their own beds, Naidoo said.
   The Rev. Beyers Naude, a white anti-apartheid activist who also
met the detainees, said, ``Their state of mind is positive and they
are in good spirits.''
   U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins met for an hour Tuesday night
with Naidoo and other members of a committee representing the
activists.
   Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa,
conferred with the Rev. Frank Chikane, the black general secretary
of the South African Council of Churches; Jay Naidoo, an Indian
anti-apartheid labor leader; and Max Coleman, a white opponent of
detention without trial.
   Chikane said Perkins promised that the activists' material needs
would be met while they were in the consulate.
   U.S. officials have said the activists would not be forced to
leave their sanctuary against their will despite a worldwide U.S.
policy of not formally granting asylum in diplomatic offices.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman said the embassy remained in contact with
the South African government about the situation.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the emergency, which the white-led
government declared to control widespread black protests.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.
