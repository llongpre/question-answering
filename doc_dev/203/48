   Three of the most prominent
anti-apartheid activists detained under state-of-emergency
regulations escaped from a hospital today and took refuge in the
U.S. consulate.
   The three men have requested a meeting with U.S. Ambassador
Edward Perkins.
   Two of the men are senior officials of the banned United
Democratic Front _ publicity secretary Murphy Morobe, a black, and
acting general secretary Mohammed Valli Moosa, an Indian. The other
is Vusi Khanyile, a black who was chairman of the banned National
Education Crisis Committee.
   The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria issued a statement confirming that
the three had taken refuge at the consulate, on the 11th floor of
an office building in downtown Johannesburg.
   ``We were in frequent contact with these three men prior to
their detention without charge and hold them in high regard,'' the
statement said. ``We will not press them to leave against their
will.''
   The statement said the United States does not offer asylum at
its diplomatic offices. But it said these premises are inviolable
under international law and may not be entered by the host
government without consent.
   The embassy said it was discussing the situation with the
activists and the South African government.
   Brig. Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry,
confirmed the incident and said the men escaped from Johannesburg
General Hospital, where they had been receiving physiotherapy. No
details of the escape were disclosed.
   Previously, the three had been at Johannesburg's Diepkloof
Prison.
   At the consulate, there was no visible sign of security force
deployments. A private guard stood at the entrance while about two
dozen journalists waited in the hall.
   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 34, were detained in July 1987
after working clandestinely for the front since a state of
emergency was declared June 12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in
December 1986.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the state of emergency. The government has
not released comprehensive statistics, but it said recently that
802 people who had been held at least 30 days were still in custody.
   Many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated
to the United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of more than
600 anti-apartheid groups.
   Also detained were virtually all top leaders of the National
Education Crisis Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher and
student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum
and policies in their schools.
   The committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts
that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the government outlawed its
subsequent campaign for ``people's education.''
   The United Democratic Front and the crisis committee were among
17 anti-apartheid organizations banned in February from conducting
any activities.
   Twice in recent years, activists have taken refuge at diplomatic
missions in South Africa. Six front leaders stayed at the British
Consulate in Durban for several weeks in late 1984 before emerging
to face arrest for high treason. The charges later were withdrawn.
   In September 1987, South Africa agreed to let a Dutchman, Klaus
de Jonge, return to the Netherlands after being holed up at a Dutch
Embassy office in Pretoria for two years. De Jonge escaped into the
office from police custody after being arrested for aiding the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
