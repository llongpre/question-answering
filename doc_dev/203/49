   At least 27 black activists,
including leaders of two banned organizations, have been detained
in an apparent crackdown on opposition to Oct. 26 elections,
newspapers reported Thursday.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of several clergymen to
defy emergency regulations by urging an election boycott, repeated
his call Thursday.
   Addressing about 2,000 people at the predominantly mixed-race
University of the Western Cape, Tutu said of next month's local
elections:
   ``Please consider prayerfully what God wants you to do. We want
to urge black people _ do not take part in a process which will
perpetuate your oppression.''
   The archbishop called on whites to join the boycott ``because
the time of white politics is past.''
   Police headquarters declined to comment on the reported
detentions. It also has declined to give details of an
investigation on whether Tutu should be prosecuted for urging an
election boycott.
   The anti-apartheid weekly New Nation said the detentions in the
past two weeks are believed to be part of a government attempt to
stifle opposition to the elections, which will mark the first time
voters of all races go to the polls on the same day.
   Many blacks oppose taking part in segregated local elections as
long as the black majority cannot vote in national elections.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper, said the activists
detained this week included Nkosi Molala, president of the Azanian
People's Organization.
   Molala's organization was one of 17 anti-apartheid groups banned
in February from conducting any activities. It espouses the
philosophy of black consciousness, or black self-reliance,
developed by Steve Biko before his death in detention in 1977.
   New Nation said 14 members of the South African Youth Congress,
another of the banned groups, have been detained since last week.
It said all top leaders of the Youth Congress now are in detention.
   New Nation, whose editor Zwelakhe Sisulu has been detained
without charge for nearly two years, said 12 other activists from
the Pretoria area were detained Wednesday.
   Two of them worked for the Community Research and Information
Service, a social service group which has expressed fears about the
life of another black staff member, Stanza Bopape.
   Police say Bopape escaped three days after being detained June
9. His family and associates have not heard from him since, and
fear he may have been killed.
   Security police have seized two tape recordings of a sermon
given by Tutu on Sunday in which he advocated an election boycott.
Such calls are punishable by up to 10 years in jail.
   In his speech Thursday, Tutu explained his defiance.
   ``It is not because Tutu is trying to look smart,'' he said. ``I
have a commitment and a passion for South Africa. We have the
potential of being one of the greatest countries. My passion makes
me able, whatever the penalties, to do what I believe God is asking
me to do.''
