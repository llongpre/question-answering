   Police offered a $4,000 reward
today for information about the killing of a prominent white
anti-apartheid activist and the country's law and order minister
said he was horrified by the murder.
   Expressions of sorrow and outrage over the death of university
professor David Webster came from both blacks and whites, and from
anti-apartheid, academic, labor and student groups across South
Africa.
   Max Coleman, who worked with Webster in several organizations
opposed to race-segregation, told hundreds of mourners Monday night
at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, ``There is
only one group that stood to gain from this act: those who are
dedicated to perpetuating the brutal and vicious system that David
dedicated his life to opposing.''
   White musician Johnny Clegg, whose Zulu-style music has gained
international acceptance despite a cultural boycott against South
Africa, sent a message of support to the meeting from Los Angeles.
   Webster, 44, an anthropology lecturer at Witwatersrand, was shot
to death outside his Johannesburg home Monday by an assailant
firing from a passing car.
   Colleagues said they had no doubt he was killed because of his
political activities. He was a prominent opponent of detention
without trial.
   Several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent
years. Many white activists have received anonymous threats or have
been harassed by vandals, but few have been attacked.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said in a statement: ``I
want to make it clear on behalf of the government that the murder
is strongly condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to
apprehend those responsible.''
   Tributes to Webster came from a wide range of organizations
opposed broadly to apartheid and specifically to various policies
of the white-led government. The groups assist families of
detainees, keep records of alleged human rights abuses, object to
military conscription and contest eviction of blacks from rented
houses.
   A spokesman for the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference
said Webster's life ``was one of great respect for the human
dignity of all people.''
   Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African
Trade Unions, said the killing ``is a blow to our struggle but it
will only strengthen our determination to uproot and destroy
apartheid evils.''
   The Detainees Parents Support Committee, banned by the
government, said Webster became an authority on forms of state
repression and also patterns of informal repression. ``His work
went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover of
darkness,'' a statement said.
   Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
