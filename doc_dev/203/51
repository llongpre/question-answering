   Police opened fire today on
black employees outside a pie factory where they had been locked out
by management. At least 15 workers were injured, police and union
officials said.
   Police also arrested an anti-apartheid activist and banned a Cape
Town rally called for Sunday by outlawed rights organizations.
   In another development, Trevor Tutu, son of Nobel Prize-winning
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was sentenced today to 18 months in prison
for allegedly making a false bomb threat at Johannesburg's
international airport.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, an official of the banned United Democratic
Front and a leader of a new campaign to defy apartheid restrictions,
was arrested at his Johannesburg office today and held there as
security police searched his files.
   Police ordered journalists from the building after the reporters
saw Valli Moosa in custody and were told he was under arrest.
   There was no immediate indication what charges might be filed
against Valli Moosa, one of three activists who escaped from
detention last year and took sanctuary at the U.S. Consulate in
Johannesburg.
   Another escapee, Murphy Morobe, said Valli Moosa's arrest
violated the government's promise that the three were free to leave
the consulate without fear of being arrested again.
   ``It shows how easy it is for the government to go back on its
word,'' said Morobe, who called on the U.S. government to condemn
the arrest.
   The Food and Allied Workers Union said scores of workers
assembled early today outside the Mama's Pies factory on
Johannesburg's southeastern outskirts, a day after the company
locked them out because of a 4-week-old wage dispute.
   The union said police used whips and live ammunition to disperse
the workers and made several arrests. The union said 15 workers were
injured, some seriously.
   Capt. Reg Crewe, a spokesman at police headquarters in Pretoria,
said police acted only after workers began pulling on the locked
factory gates and ingored an order to disperse. He said officers
initially used whips, but fired shotguns when some fleeing workers
threw stones.
   He said four people were slightly injured by the shotgun fire and
15 others suffered minor injuries while being dispersed. He said no
one was arrested.
   It was the second violent labor clash in two days.
   On Thursday, police said at least 10 people were injured outside
the British-owned Eveready plant in Port Elizabeth in clashes
between striking workers and people recruited to fill their jobs.
   Crewe, asked about the banned Cape Town rally, said he did not
know if similar rallies planned for Sunday in other cities also
would be banned.
   Desmond Tutu said the ban was ``inflammatory and dangerous'' and
called for an alternative rally at his church in Cape Town.
   Tutu's 32-year-old son, Trevor, was convicted of violating the
Aviation Act by falsely telling police that there was a bomb in his
luggage. He had pleaded innocent and said he would appeal the
conviction.
   Shortly after the Dec. 31 incident at Jan Smuts Airport, Trevor
Tutu convened a news conference and told reporters he deliberately
courted arrest as part of a publicity stunt on behalf of his
advertising agency.
   He also was convicted on three counts of criminal injury and
fined $440 for allegedly interfering with police last year when they
tried to arrest a friend of his on suspicion of drunken driving.
   In 1984, Trevor Tutu was held by police for three days before he
was cleared of a charge of drunken driving. In 1985, he was briefly
detained after arguing with police at a courthouse about the
detention of black children.
   Tutu's father is leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa
and one of the country's most prominent anti-apartheid activists.
There was no immediate comment from the archbishop about his son's
conviction.
   The United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of activist
organizations, and 16 other anti-apartheid groups last year were
ordered to halt all activities. They intended to declare themselves
legal on Sunday, the front's sixth anniversary.
   The rallies were organized as part of a nationwide campaign of
defiance. In other phases of the campaign, blacks have sought
treatment at segregated white hospitals and dozens of activists have
defied restrictions imposed on them following their recent release
from imprisonment.
