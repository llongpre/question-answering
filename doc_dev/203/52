   Anti-apartheid church leaders
Wednesday urged some of the 300 detainees on a hunger strike to
suspend the fast while efforts are made to resolve the crisis.
   The detainees, some of whom have not eaten since Jan. 23, are
demanding they be released or put on trial. Twenty-one have been
hospitalized, and church leaders said they were worried about the
health of the men.
   ``We urge the detainees, particularly those already in the danger
zone, to suspend their action while church leaders, lawyers,
community leaders and the public seek ways of resolving the
problem,'' the Rev. Frank Chikane told a news conference in
Johannesburg.
   Chikane, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Rev. Allan Boesak
planned to discuss the hunger strike Thursday in Cape Town with the
minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok.
   Vlok has said the government cannot be ``blackmailed'' by the
estimated 1,000 people in detention, but 17 men were released
Tuesday, including two who were participating in the strike.
   Chikane said the church leaders were asking only those detainees
who were sick or who had been fasting most of the 23 days to resume
eating.
   ``We are concerned that their health could be permanently
damaged,'' said Chikane, leader of the South African Council of
Churches, which represents most major Protestant denominations.
   ``We are encouraged that Minister Vlok is willing to address the
situation of emergency detainees as a matter of urgency,'' Chikane
said.
   But he added, ``If he does not respond positively he will create
a serious problem.''
   The strike began at Diepkloof Prison outside Johannesburg on Jan.
23 and has spread to several cities around the country. Some of the
participants have been held without charge since the nationwide
state of emergency was declared in June 1986.
   Lawyers said Wednesday that an undetermined number of the 111
detainees at Westville Prison in Durban had joined the hunger strike
and that detainees at a nearby prison in Pietermaritzburg will stop
eating Monday.
   Student leaders at five South African universities began a hunger
strike Wednesday in solidarity with the detainees. They said it
would last eight days.
   ``We support the detainees' demand to be charged or released,''
the group said in a statement. ``We see their demand as a response
to the intransigence of a government intent on criminalizing the
voice of the majority of South Africans.''
   At the University of the Western Cape outside Cape Town, about
2,000 students participated in a rally calling for the release of
the hunger strikers.
   In another development Wednesday, an inquest began into the 1985
killings of black teacher and activist Matthew Goniwe and three
colleagues.
   Goniwe's associates contend the four were assassinated because of
their involvement in the anti-apartheid movement. No suspects have
been arrested.
   Goniwe and Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkhonto and Sicelo Mhlawuli
vanished on June 27, 1985, after starting back to their hometown of
Cradock from a meeting in Port Elizabeth of the United Democratic
Front, an anti-apartheid coalition to which they belonged.
   Their burned-our car was found near Port Elizabeth the next day.
Their bodies, burned and stabbed, were discovered during a five-day
search.
