   Prominent anti-apartheid
activist and journalist Zwelakhe Sisulu, who has been detained
without charge for two years, was released today and placed under
tight restrictions.
   Sisulu, editor of the New Nation newspaper, will not be allowed
to work on the publication, cannot give interviews or be in the
presence of more than 10 people and must remain in the Johannesburg
area, his lawyer Priscilla Jana said. ``The restrictions are very,
very heavy,'' Ms. Jana said as she ushered Sisulu from Diepkloof
Prison in the Soweto township outside Johannesburg.
   Lt. Peet Bothma of the Law and Order Ministry said several other
detainees also would be released today, but he did not say how many
or who they were. A source who demanded anonymity said Eric Molobi,
an official with the National Education Crisis Committee, also was
to be freed.
   Sisulu, 37, has been held without charge since December 1986
under state of emergency regulations.
   His parents also are among the country's best-known activists.
Sisulu's father is jailed African National Congress leader Walter
Sisulu, a close colleague of ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   Sisulu's mother, Albertina, is a co-president of the United
Democratic Front, a banned anti-apartheid coalition. Mrs. Sisulu,
who works as a nurse in the Soweto township, is under government
restrictions that prevent her from being quoted. She has been
detained several times and was under banning orders from 1964-81.
   The decision to release Sisulu and other detainees is the latest
in a series of government actions that appears aimed at reducing
domestic and international pressure on South Africa.
   In the past 10 days, the goverment has:
   _Released two aging and ailing activists, Harry Gwala, 69, a
long-time ANC member, and Zeph Mothopeng, 75, president of the Pan
Africanist Congresss, another outlawed anti-apartheid group.
   _Announced that Mandela, the country's best known black leader,
will not return to prison when he completes his recuperation from
tuberculosis at a Cape Town hospital. However, the government has
said Mandela will remain in custody.
   _Granted clemency to the ``Sharpeville Six,'' a group of blacks
convicted of complicity in a 1984 mob killing. Their death
sentences, replaced with lengthy jail terms, had touched off an
international protest campaign.
   Sisulu, who worked for several newspapers before joining New
Nation, was detained for eight months in 1981-2.
   In both 1979 and 1982 he was sentenced to prison for refusing to
testify at trials involving activists. But both convictions were set
aside on appeal. He was a Niemann Fellow at Harvard University in
1984-5.
   He was named editor of New Nation in 1986, but was detained in
June. He was released several months later, but was again detained
in December.
   The New Nation newspaper, which is published by the Southern
Africa Catholic Bishops' Conference, was suspended for three months
by the government earlier this year but has resumed publishing.
