   A group of U.S.
representatives sent a scathing letter to President P.W. Botha to
express ``outrage and dismay'' over the slaying of a black activist.
   Seven U.S. senators signed a similar letter to Piet Koornhof,
South Africa's ambassador to the United States, that also protested
the Jan. 24 slaying of Godfry Sicelo Dhlomo, 18.
   Dhlomo, an anti-apartheid activist, was killed four days after
police questioned him about his appearance in foreign television
documentaries, including a CBS documentary, ``Children of
Apartheid.''
   ``We the undersigned members of the U.S. Congress are writing to
express our outrage and dismay at the assassination of Godfrey
Sicelo Dhlomo,'' said the letter, signed by 31 House members and
obtained by The Associated Press on Monday.
   ``He is one of more than two dozen anti-apartheid activists
killed in mysterious circumstances since 1980,'' it said. ``None of
these killings have been solved by the police, lending allegations
of official involvement greater credibility.
   ``Physical evidence attests to the fact that Mr. Dhlomo was
beaten and tortured, and it is common knowledge that intimidation
and threats are everyday tools of the South African Security Police.
   ``A South Africa in flames will be the inevitable result of your
government's failure to reform security police tactics and work
toward a democratic society. We strongly urge a prompt and thorough
investigation into Mr. Dhlomo's death and other apartheid-related
crimes.''
   Some of the House members who signed the Feb. 11 letter will
participate in hearings on South Africa beginning March 15. The
letter to Botha was initiated by Cardiss Collins, D-Ill.
   Police arrested Dhlomo during a raid on the Johannesburg offices
of a civil rights organization on Jan. 20 and questioned him about
his statements in several foreign news films.
   After his body was found near his parents' home in Soweto,
several anti-apartheid groups said they suspected police
involvement. The police have denied involvement and have offered a
$2,500 reward for the arrest of the killer or killers.
   The letter signed by the Senate members, written by Sen. Barbara
A. Mikulski, D-Md., said: ``We have a very strong interest in
Sicelo and require your government to allow an independent body to
investigate the circumstances under which he was murdered.''
   The House letter addressed Botha as prime minister, a post he
has not held since 1984 when he became president under a new
constitution.
