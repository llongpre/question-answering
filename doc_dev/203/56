   Police arrested demonstrating
students, journalists and trade unionists Thursday, and
anti-apartheid activists announced nationwide protests of next
week's segregated elections.
   Acting President F.W. de Klerk said police arrested nine
guerrillas who planned violent disruptions of Wednesday's
parliamentary elections, which exclude blacks.
   A bomb exploded Thursday night at a community center in a
mixed-race township outside Cape Town, police and witnesses said. No
one was seriously injured.
   In Johannesburg, police banned a defiance rally at the University
of the Witwatersrand, then fired repeated volleys of tear gas and
rubber bullets at hundreds of students who reassembled each time
they were dispersed.
   Police, who were seen charging through campus buildings in search
of protesters, said they arrested 10 blacks.
   An estimated 5,000 mixed-race high school students in the city
boycotted classes to protest the elections.
   Police raided the Johannesburg home and office of Jay Naidoo,
general secretary of the militant Congress of South African Trade
Unions, and later arrested about 10 members of the labor federation
who protested the action.
   ``The raids ... were a blatant form of intimidation and
disruption of our legitimate activities,'' Naidoo said. ``At no time
did the police specify what offense they were investigating.''
   The explosion near Cape Town rocked a community center housing
offices of an anti-apartheid organization in a mixed-race township,
police and witnesses said. It occurred shortly after several
meetings broke up in the building.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which caused minor
damage.
   Also in Cape Town, 12 journalists protesting media regulations
under the state of emergency were arrested. Nearby, about 25 black
squatters were arrested outside a government office where they were
demanding improved services and an end to evictions.
   In Durban, police detained five activists involved in planning a
weekend protest by blacks on a whites-only beach. One of them,
Curtick Ndlovu, is a senior official of the banned United Democratic
Front.
   A police spokesman, Gen. Herman Stadler, said ``quite a number''
of political activists had been detained without charge in the past
two days, but gave no details.
   The UDF, the trade union congress and other major anti-apartheid
organizations said national protests of the elections would take
place Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Emergency regulations prohibit calls for general strikes, but
previous national protests have taken that form.
   The groups also calls for a month-long consumer boycott starting
a week after the elections.
   De Klerk, in a speech at a police college, said nine guerrillas
of the African National Congress and 10 collaborators had been
arrested in the past week.
   He said police seized a ``big quantity'' of Soviet-made limpet
mines, rifles and hand grenades which allegedly were to be used in
terrorist attacks to disrupt the election.
   South Africa's Parliament includes segregated mixed-race and
Indian chambers, as well as the dominant white chamber. Many
anti-apartheid leaders of all races oppose the elections because the
28 million black majority is excluded.
   Activists and police have clashed almost daily since the launch
of a defiance campaign Aug. 2. The civil disobedience has included
protests against whites-only schools, hospitals, beaches and buses.
   Meanwhile, three blacks were killed in ongoing factional violence
in Natal Province, police said. The conflict is between supporters
of militant anti-apartheid groups and the more conservative Zulu
political organization, Inkatha.
