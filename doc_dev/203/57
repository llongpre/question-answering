   Anthony Bloom, a leader of white business opposition to the government and its apartheid policies, announced he intends to emigrate from South Africa. 

   Sounding a note of frustration and despair, Mr. Bloom said, "I have the sense that the government is very firmly in control at the moment." 
Mr. Bloom will give up his position as chairman of Premier Group Holdings Ltd., a consumer-goods company, and move to Britain in April. 

   Mr. Bloom's unexpected departure will further weaken the voice of the country's liberal white opposition, which has been fairly well muzzled by the 18-month-old state of emergency. 
The 48-year-old executive was one of the first white businessmen to formally meet with exiled leaders of the banned African National Congress, or ANC, the liberation movement. 
Since that meeting in 1985, he has frequently, and loudly, called upon the government to scrap apartheid and to begin negotiating a peaceful transition to a post-apartheid society. 

   Although he stressed family and business reasons for his decision to emigrate, associates said Mr. Bloom has grown increasingly frustrated with the impotence of white business in prodding the government into change. 
They said he has also been shocked and hurt by the government's tough criticism and bullying of outspoken businessmen like himself. 
Last year, the government accused First National Bank's chief, Chris Ball, of financing an ANC newspaper ad; the resulting investigation sullied the banker's reputation and hurt the bank's business among conservative whites. 

   This frustration and disillusionment is widespread among liberal South African businessmen, and has caused them to back off from direct confrontation with the government. 
"We realize that the game of going to tell {State President} P.W. Botha what to do is over," said a strategist at one of the country's largest companies. 

   At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Bloom said one of his biggest disappointments was the outcome of last May's general election, when the ruling National Party tightened its hold on the government and the pro-apartheid Conservative Party became the official opposition, replacing the liberal Progressive Federal Party. 

   "I am sad and worried about the future of liberalism in South Africa," Mr. Bloom said. 
"There are not enough people who feel the way I do." 

   A number of those who do already have left. 
Several thousand white South Africans, mostly professional and middle-level managers frightened by the increasing polarization in their country, emigrate each year. 
Fellow liberals worry that Mr. Bloom's departure raises this "brain drain" to a new level. 

   "It seems there is a new trend that the real captains of industry are bailing out," said David Webster, an official of the Five Freedoms Forum, an anti-apartheid organization formed last year to convince whites to stay in South Africa and fight from the inside. 
Last year, Gordon Waddell, the chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, left the country, voicing disillusionment with the government's intransigence. 

   "If the voice of liberal big business disappears," said Mr. Webster, "it will be bad news."
