   Three prominent activists
encamped in the U.S. Consulate said in a letter published Monday
they will remain in their sanctuary to ``illustrate the pain of
detention.''
   The anti-apartheid leaders _ Murphy Morobe and Mohanned Valli
Moosa, leaders of the banned United Democratic Front coalition, and
Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned National Education Crisis
Committee _ have been at the Johannesburg consulate since they
escaped from detention Sept. 13. Morobe and Khanyile are black,
Valli Moosa is of Indian descent.
   Each had been held more than a year without trial under the
country's state of emergency regulations.
   The South African government has said the three are free to
leave the consulate and will not be detained or restricted.
   But the activists said they do not trust the government and
repeated their call for the release of other political detainees.
   ``One newspaper editorial suggested that we should `call the
government's bluff' by walking out,'' the three said in letter
dated Sept. 28 and published Monday in the Sowetan, which covers
the main black township outside Johannesburg.
   ``We do not need to tempt the devil in order to merely prove he
is evil,'' they said. ``We really see no virtue in handing
ourselves over for another indefinite period in detention.''
   The men gave no indication of when they intended to leave the
consulate.
   ``We find no joy in spending 24 hours a day in the United States
Consulate boardroom,'' the letter said. ``However, our escape and
subsequent occupation of the consulate is meant ... to illustrate
the pain of detention which hundreds around the country suffer.'''
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without trial for
varying lengths of time under the 28-month-old state of emergency.
About 1,000 people currently are believed to be in detention. Most
are being held for political activism.
   An activist who escaped Sept. 21 to the U.S. Consulate, Clifford
Ngcobo, left his refuge Saturday to obtain medical treatment, his
law firm said.
   Ngcobo has filed a civil court action alleging police assaulted
him and tortured him with electric shocks during the five months he
was detained without being charged.
   The government has said Ngcobo will not be detained again, but
that he faces possible prosecution on a charge of illegal weapons
possession.
