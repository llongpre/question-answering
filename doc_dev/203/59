   The Missouri abortion case being
argued before the U.S. Supreme Court this week will be the first
state Attorney General William Webster has personally argued before
the justices since being elected in 1984.
   Although some observers say Webster has tried not to politicize
the case, critics wonder if the 35-year-old Republican is using it
to boost his political future. Webster is already laying the
groundwork for a 1992 bid for governor.
   Tony Feather, executive director of the Missouri Republican
Party, expressed doubt that politics was behind Webster's decision
to personally argue before the court, but acknowledged the case has
not hurt him.
   ``He's already got a strong political benefit out of it by the
fact that it's gone this far. I don't think he would argue it if he
didn't think he was the best attorney for it,'' Feather said.
   Six Missouri cases have been heard by the U.S. Supreme Court
during Webster's tenure.
   In next week's arguments, Webster will defend a 1986 Missouri
law prohibiting the use of public funds for abortions and declaring
that human life begins at conception. Sections of the law were
found unconstitional by the U.S. District Court in Kansas City, and
that decision was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``Given the publicity the case is getting, it's hard not to say
that Webster is arguing it to promote himself,'' Thomas Blumenthal,
a lawyer for abortion rights advocates, said recently. ``This makes
it more obvious this is a political question, not a legal one.''
   Webster contends he is merely trying to do the best job possible
on the case, named Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   ``This is one of the most important cases of the term. It is one
of national significance and it merits my personal participation,''
Webster said through a spokeswoman, Mary Jenkins.
   Feather said Webster has sequestered himself in his office in
recent weeks to study the case and has shut off interviews.
Webster, a former radio reporter, is usually accessible to
reporters.
   ``We've bent over backwards not to politicize this case,'' Ms.
Jenkins said.
   A native of Carthage in southwestern Missouri, Webster earned a
speech and communications degree from the University of Kansas
before getting his law degree from the University of
Missouri-Kansas City. He practiced law in Joplin before being
elected attorney general.
   When he was first elected attorney general in 1984, he was 31 _
the youngest person to hold that office in Missouri in nearly 100
years.
   Webster is ``personally pro-life, but he feels that his personal
views are irrelevant. It is his constitutional duty to uphold the
law,'' Ms. Jenkins said.
