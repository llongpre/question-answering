   President F.W. de Klerk
summoned police commanders to a closed-door meeting and told them
the nation's force will no longer be used to fight the government's
political battles, a major newspaper reported Sunday.
   ``We can't become embroiled in an Eighty Years War,'' de Klerk
reportedly told 500 commanders. ``We will have to move toward
finding solutions that are acceptable to the majority of the
population.''
   Also Sunday, Raymond Suttner, a prominent white anti-apartheid
activist who left South Africa illegally last year, returned to a
jubilant welcome from colleagues. Police followed him home but took
no immediate action.
   De Klerk addressed the police commanders about two weeks ago,
but the speech remained secret until the nationally circulated
Sunday Times reported its contents. The newspaper said de Klerk
asked the commanders to convey his message to every member of the
force.
   Anton Pretorius, a spokesman for de Klerk, confirmed that the
president had addressed the police commanders, but said he could
not comment on the substance of the speech.
   Since taking office in August, de Klerk has eased restrictions
on anti-government protests, freed senior leaders of the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement and allowed them to
engage freely in political activity. These moves, and a public
commitment to free top ANC leader Nelson Mandela, are believed to
have embittered some right-wing officers in the national police
force.
   De Klerk, in his speech, reportedly said he was aware that his
actions ``have raised a number of questions in your minds.''
   ``In the past, you have been asked to handle situations that had
nothing to do with ordinary crime,'' de Klerk was quoted as saying,
referring to use of police to disperse protests and enforce
segregation laws.
   ``Circumstances have changed and we have reviewed our definition
of crime.''
   ``It will never again be asked of you to say to someone, `Hey,
you can't swim here because of your appearance,''' de Klerk
reportedly said. ``You will not be required to prevent people from
gathering to gain support for their views.''
   ``This is the political battlefield, and we want to take the
police out of it,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Let the politicians
look after politics.''
   De Klerk reportedly said his government sought to take the
intiative in avoiding a race war.
   ``For if this Armageddon takes place _ and blood flows ankle
deep in our streets and 4 or 5 million people lie dead _ the
problem will remain exactly the same as before the shooting
started,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Since de Klerk announced in September that peaceful protests
would be allowed, most marches and demonstrations have proceeded
without serious disturbances. However, police have insisted that
permission for major protests be obtained in advance, and there
have been clashes in several cases where approval was not obtained.
   The anti-apartheid activist Suttner said upon his return to
Johannesburg that he was uncertain whether police would act against
him.
   ``All I have done is exercise my freedom of speech,'' he said.
   During his time abroad, Suttner said, several Western diplomats
assured him that their governments would lodge protests if he were
detained again.
   Suttner, a law school lecturer, was freed from jail in September
after more than two years in detention. No charges were filed
against him, and he spent much of the time in solitary confinement.
   Upon his release, he was placed under heavy restrictions and was
barred him from any educational facility, including the University
of the Witwatersrand where he taught.
   In December, Suttner, 43, broke his restrictions, went to
Zimbabwe to attend an anti-apartheid conference and then remained
abroad.
