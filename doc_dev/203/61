   Commuter buses from Soweto
were deserted today and four buses near Durban were firebombed as
hundreds of thousands of blacks joined the first nationwide protest
strike since major opposition groups were banned last month.
   In other violence, police fired tear gas at a predominantly
Indian university and arrested students who tried to force others
to join the boycott. The strike was organized in defiance of
emergency regulations to commemorate the 28th anniversary of a
massacre in the township of Sharpeville and to protest the banning
of any activity by the United Democratic Front and 16 other
anti-apartheid groups.
   Police estimated 40 percent of the black work force in the
Johannesburg region stayed away from their jobs, but did not give a
figure for the number involved.
   In Sharpeville, residents placed flowers at graves of some of
the 69 massacre victims and held memorial services.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, attended one of the services after arriving in the
township south of Johannesburg in a bus with other activists.
   There was an unconfirmed report police ordered the bus to leave,
but Mrs. Mandela said her group left voluntarily.
   In Soweto, the black township of 2.5 million people outside
Johannesburg, virtually no passengers boarded commuter buses,
according to Cheryl Roxmouth of the Putco bus company. Normal daily
ridership is about 75,000.
   Schools and most shops in Soweto were closed, and residents said
few of the hundreds of mini-bus taxis which carry many Sowetans to
work were operating.
   South African Transport Services said ridership on its trains
during morning rush hour was down by up to 20 percent. It dismissed
as inaccurate an earlier press report that said ridership was down
by about 80 percent.
   In Durban, four Putco buses were firebombed, prompting Putco to
halt service in several townships when drivers refused to work.
Police reported two unrest-related killings of blacks overnight,
one near Durban and one in Soweto, but gave no indication if they
were linked to the protest.
   At the University of Durban-Westville, where most students are
of Indian descent, police used tear gas to disperse protesters and
arrested some students who tried to force others to boycott
classes. Some students attending class were beaten by supporters of
the boycott.
   The strike was widespread in the Johannesburg-Pretoria area, in
Durban and around the eastern Cape Province city of Port Elizabeth.
More than 90 percent of black workers reportedly stayed home around
the city of Uitenhage, where police killed 21 blacks during a
funeral procession on Sharpeville Day in 1985.
   There was no explicit call for workers in the Cape Town area to
strike.
   The United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, had coordinated previous nationwide
protests during the 21-month-old state of emergency. Emergency
regulations outlaw calls for strikes and boycotts, but hundreds of
thousands of black workers and students nonetheless observed these
protests by staying away from jobs and schools.
   Several affiliates of the front, not affected by the new ban,
took out newspaper advertisements announcing today's ``national day
of protest.''
   Police commanders threatened action against organizers of the
strike and issued assurances that blacks wishing to work would be
protected from intimidators. There were reports of black youths
turning back commuters but no reports of physical intimidation.
   Commemorative services were scheduled in several cities and
townships to mark the anniversary of the 1960 massacre in
Sharpeville. Sixty-nine blacks were killed and about 180 injured
when police fired on thousands of demonstrators protesting the pass
laws. Those laws, which restricted blacks' freedom of movement,
were repealed in 1986.
   The predominantly white University of Cape Town and the mostly
mixed-race University of the Western Cape closed in solidarity with
the protest. For similar reasons, today's performance of ``District
Six,'' a musical with an anti-apartheid theme playing to full
houses in Johannesburg, was canceled.
   An afternoon protest was planned at Johannesburg's University of
the Witwatersrand, where the president of the student council,
Rosemary Hunter, reportedly was detained by police early today.
   Sharpeville returned to the spotlight last week when it became
known that Friday had been set as the execution date for the
``Sharpeville Six'' _ five black men and a woman convicted of
complicity in the mob killing of a black town councilor during
anti-apartheid riots in 1984.
   Appeals for clemency poured in from around the world, but
President P.W. Botha said he would not intervene to save the six.
   On Thursday, 15 hours before the hangings were to take place, a
Supreme Court judge granted a one-month stay of execution in order
to consider defense attorneys' claims that a key state witness has
perjured himself.
