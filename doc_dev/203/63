   Black students demanding a
boycott of final exams to protest school conditions clashed with
pupils who wanted to take the tests, leaving up to 19 people dead,
police said Monday.
   Ten more blacks were killed in other township violence,
including eight apparently caught in a feud between competing taxi
companies, police reported.
   The student violence in Bekkersdal, outside Johannesburg, began
Thursday and lasted through the weekend. It was unclear if all 19
deaths were the result of student clashes, but police Capt. Eugene
Opperman said he believed most were.
   According to police, students opposed to the year-end exams had
been trying to prevent other students from taking the standardized
tests, which determine whether students may proceed onto the next
grade or gain admission to universities.
   Last year, less than half of the black students passed the
tests, compared with a pass rate of more than 90 percent for white
students.
   The white-led government spends five times as much to educate a
white pupil as a black pupil in South Africa, and anti-apartheid
activists have complained for years about problems in the black
schools.
   Opperman said not all the people involved in the Bekkersdal
clashes were students. He said one body was found Monday, but it
was unclear when the person died. He also did not know when the
other 18 deaths occurred.
   Police used tear gas Monday to disperse stone-throwers, Opperman
said. There were reports of arson, and one youth was seriously
wounded in a stabbing, police Capt. Henriette Bester said.
   Also Monday, police said eight people died when men in vans
randomly stabbed and shot people Sunday in the township of
Kutloanong, 140 miles southwest of Johannesburg.
   They were believed to have been victims of a feud between taxi
companies that began fighting each other last week in Kutloanong.
Before Sunday's attacks, three people had died in the taxi war.
   There are an estimated 100,000 privately owned taxi-vans
operating in black areas nationwide, and violent disputes over
routes and passengers occur regularly.
   Also, the daily police unrest report said one man died in the
township of Alexandra, outside Johannesburg. Another man was
stabbed to death in Mganga Baboyi, a township in the eastern
province of Natal, the unrest report added. It did not say when
those deaths occurred.
   More than 5,000 people have died in Natal since 1986 in fighting
between supporters of the African National Congress and the Inkatha
Freedom Party. Both groups oppose apartheid but disagree on tactics
to fight it and on their view of a future South Africa.
   Factional fighting involving university students broke out over
the weekend in the Johannesburg township of Soweto, and one man was
critically injured, officials said. The fighting involved students
from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and
occurred at a Soweto dormitory used by the university.
