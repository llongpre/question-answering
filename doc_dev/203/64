never again take off or land with a ball-point pen in my breast pocket. In a
crash landing, this tool of the writer's trade can penetrate the heart like an
ice pick. Clyde C. Snow, at one time the physical anthropologist at the
Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aeromedical Institute, saw enough
evidence of this in all the plane crashes he helped reconstruct. Whenever he
flies he carefully slips his pen in with the safety literature and airline
magazine in the seat pocket in front of him.;    In the world of applied
physical anthropology, specifically forensic anthropology, Snow is without
peer. When a crime victim has been reduced to nothing but bones, or pieces of
bones, Snow is often the only one who can determine who the victim was and
what happened. "Witnesses From the Grave" is Snow's story.;    It also is the
history of forensic anthropology, which dates back in this country to about
1850, and the murder of Dr. George Parkman. When Parkman paid a visit to a
colleague at the Harvard Medical School to collect a debt, police said parts
of him ended up in Dr. John White Webster's privy. Physicians and dentists
from Harvard were assembled to sort through the mess in an attempt to identify
the remains.;    Oliver Wendell Holmes, then dean of the Harvard Medical
College, was joined on the panel by Dr. Jeffries Wyman, professor of anatomy
at the university. They were able to conclude that the remains were human and
belonged to one person about the same age, height and build as Parkman. A set
of dentures retrieved from Webster's stove and the testimony of Parkman's
dentist, Dr. Nathan Keep, sent Webster to the gallows, despite the contrary
testimony of another dentist, Dr. William T. G. Morton, the man who discovered
ether.;    Boston was so taken by the trial that viewers were rousted and
replaced every 10 minutes. By trial's end, 55,000 Bostonians had peeked at the
proceedings. (It's a measure, perhaps, of how fascinating the case remains
that it's also the cover story of the latest Granta, "Death of a Harvard
Man.");    Paris became the center for advances in forensic anthropology at
the turn of the century. Systems were carefully developed and espoused for
determining criminality by physical characteristics. An offshoot of this false
start, however, was the compiling of so much hard data on the skeletal system,
including measurements of men and women of all ages, that statistically
relevant tables eventually could be constructed. Snow is able to say a pelvis
is that of a female of a certain age because statistically, given the
measurements and other evidence, it should be so.;    Wars have been of
particular use to forensic anthropologists for putting into their hands
significant numbers of skeletal remains. Mildred Trotter was tapped by the
Army in 1946 to set up shop in Hawaii to identify war dead brought in from
Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and the Philippine jungles. She convinced her colleagues
that as important as identification might be, measuring all the bones of the
dead and compiling records for future statisticians was absolutely vital. T.
Dale Stewart repeated the exercise in the Korean War, then went on to tutor
the FBI in forensic anthropology.;    Snow just missed serving in the Korean
War. He had grown up in Texas and New Mexico, the son of a doctor, traveling
rounds with his father. He finished high school at a rigorous New Mexico
military academy in a failed attempt to harness his wild side, then proceeded
through a college career that shifted from zoology to medical school and back
to zoology, then to archeology and finally anthropology, all the time reading
the great poets, boozing, chasing women and smoking heavily.;    He first made
a name for himself at the FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute with studies that
led to the redesign of seat-restraint systems, particularly for the airline
cabin staff. As "the cowboy professor," Snow lectured in anthropology at the
University of Oklahoma, and eventually caught the attention of the Oklahoma
medical examiner, his entree into a career in crime investigation.;    In his
career, Snow would attend to some of the more famous air tragedies as well as
famous murder cases, including the John Wayne Gacy affair. When the Brazilians
thought they had found the bones of Joseph Mengele, Snow was among the
international panel of experts who agreed on the identification. Even more
compelling -- and perhaps most important -- is the story of Snow's work at the
mass grave sites of the "disappeared" of Argentina, giving back identities to
the dead as well as compiling statistically relevant data demonstrating how a
government slaughtered its own youth. (box)  </TEXT>
