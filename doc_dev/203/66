   William Webster, who was second choice as FBI
director a decade ago and again as CIA director in 1987, has led
both agencies out of the shadow of scandal.
   President-elect George Bush asked Webster on Tuesday to continue
to head the nation's top foreign intelligence agency.
   Webster, 64, pledged at his confirmation hearings last year to
keep members of congressional oversight committees fully informed of
CIA activities. His predecessor, the late William Casey, had been
criticized for hiding details of the Iran-Contra affair from
Congress.
   ``I have total confidence that he is the man, the best man to
build and lead our national intelligence community,'' Bush said in
announcing Webster's reappointment. Bush, who led the CIA himself
for a year under President Ford, said Webster's appointment was
``open-ended.''
   Webster announced before his confirmation that to avoid the
appearance of being ``a political animal'' he had asked to have the
CIA director's post removed from the president's Cabinet. Casey had
been the first CIA director to serve at the Cabinet level. The CIA
job is to remain a non-Cabinet position under Bush.
   Webster, a former federal judge from St. Louis who had headed the
FBI for nine years, was picked by President Reagan for the CIA job
after Deputy CIA Director Robert M. Gates had his nomination
withdrawn because of Senate questions about his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Webster agreed during confirmation hearings to review Gates'
testimony to Congress on the affair but deterimined he did nothing
that should prevent him from continuing as deputy. Gates also is to
remain in the No. 2 CIA post in the Bush administration, agency
spokesman Bill Baker said.
   Webster, a Republican, was nominated in 1978 by Democratic
President Carter to head the FBI, whose two previous directors had
been embroiled in political controversy. He was nominated after
Frank M. Johnson Jr., another federal judge, withdrew his name
because of ill health.
   The FBI's image had been sullied by revelations of personal
vendettas the bureau carried out for the late J. Edgar Hoover,
illegal surveillance of Vietnam war protesters and actions by acting
Director L. Patrick Gray III to hamper investigations into the
unfolding Watergate scandal in the early 1970s.
   In nine years asFBI director, Webster was popular with Congress.
His confirmation to become the 14th head of the CIA passed
unanimously in the Senate Intelligence Committee and was approved
94-1 by the full Senate.
   In 18 months at the CIA helm, Webster has improved the agency's
relations with Congress. He has pledged to disclose to congressional
leaders, in all but the most pressing circumstances, covert foreign
intelligence activities within 48 hours after the president approves
them.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence Committee chairman,
praised Webster's reappointment, saying the director had ``helped
restore public confidence in the CIA during a very troubling
period.''
   Last March, Webster told a congressional committee he had
reorganized the spy agency to improve counterintelligence and
strengthen security at U.S. embassies.
   Webster, who grew up in the St. Louis suburb of Webster Groves,
Mo., received a bachelor's degree from Amherst College and a law
degree in 1949 from Washington University in St. Louis.
   He served briefly as U.S. attorney for eastern Missouri and was
appointed to the U.S. District Court bench by President Nixon in
1971 and to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1973.
   Webster, a widower, has three children.
