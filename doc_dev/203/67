   Police and soldiers conducted
body searches on black voters outside Cape Town as South Africans of
all races voted today in segregated municipal elections.
   President P.W. Botha's ruling party was expected to lose ground
to extreme right-wing opponents in white cities, and a light turnout
was reported in black townships where anti-apartheid activists urged
a vote boycott in defiance of the government's state of emergency
regulations.
   State Radio South Africa reported 1,946 candidates for the 7,229
town council seats were elected unopposed. It noted fewer than half
the 1,839 black township council seats were being contested, with no
candidates for 138 seats.
   Black, white, Asian and mixed-race voters cast ballots today,
marking the first time all four major race groups in South Africa
voted on the same day.
   Anti-apartheid activists such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner
of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, called for a national day of protest
today. Such calls usually include a general strike.
   But most black townships appeared normal except for heightened
police patrols and the presence of armed security forces around
polling booths and transportation facilities.
   Police said gasoline bombs were thrown during the night at the
homes of three candidates in Soweto, the country's largest black
township, outside Johannesburg. Also, a limpet mine exploded in a
beer hall in Soweto, but there were no injuries.
   Two black candidates had been killed during the campaign, one
Monday night outside Port Elizabeth, the other in August in Soweto.
   Many schools in Soweto were closed because of poor attendance,
officials said, and black students writing exams in Umlazi outside
Durban were fired on. Buses and trains were stoned in the black
township of Claremont outside Durban.
   Voting was extremely slow in many black areas around Cape Town,
with one or two voters showing up by midday at some polling places.
But poll workers said more than 1,000 voters turned out in
Khayelitsha, where police were seen conducting body searches of
people entering the polling area.
   Critics say black turnout figures this year will be virtually
meaningless because millions of blacks are ineligible to vote and no
candidates linked to major anti-apartheid groups are running.
   Most leading opposition groups are banned, and most activists
view black town councils as subservient extensions of the
white-controlled central government.
   Truckloads of police were posted at the polling booth in Mayfair,
a white suburb of Johannesburg where non-whites have begun living
illegally.
   In Soweto, police with rifles stood around polling booths;
soldiers and police on motorcycles and horses were stationed near
the police station.
   Bombings and hand grenade attacks have averaged more than one a
day in South Africa since September. Police say the attacks are part
of a campaign by the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement to disrupt the elections.
   A car bomb killed three black men and injured 18 on Monday in the
town of Witbank, east of Johannesburg.
   On Tuesday, riot police used tear gas and clubs to disperse more
than 1,000 activists at University of the Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg who were calling for an election boycott.
   There were no injuries in that incident, but about 30 high school
students in Cape Town similarly protesting the elections suffered
slight injuries in a clash Tuesday with club-wielding police, school
officials said.
   The government had sought a high turnout to bolster its claim
that it is ``broadening democracy'' in South Africa.
   In the white elections, Botha's National Party was in a showdown
with the staunchly pro-apartheid Conservative Party. The
Conservatives were predicting they could capture the city council in
Pretoria, the capital.
   The Conservatives, who see Botha's gradual race reforms as
capitulation to the black majority, seek to reimpose strict
segregation throughout South Africa.
   The Conservatives won 26 percent of the vote in the national
elections of May 1987, and claim they could seriously challenge the
National Party in parliamentary elections expected by early 1990.
   In the black elections, less than 500,000 of the country's 26
million blacks were expected to vote despite a massive government
advertising campaign to promote black turnout. About 2.4 million
blacks are registered to vote in municipal elections, but blacks
have no vote in national elections.
   In 1983, when black municipal elections were last held, 21
percent of the registered voters cast ballots, and about the same
expected this time.
   Low turnouts also were expected in Asian and ``colored,'' or
mixed-race, townships. Asians and mixed-race people have their own
houses in the tri-cameral Parliament, as do the whites.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a range of statements the
government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has
not been comprehensive.
