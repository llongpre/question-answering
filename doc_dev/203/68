   Anti-apartheid activists today
accused the government of reneging on a promise to release a
substantial number of detainees as South Africa marked its 1,000th
day under a state of emergency.
   ``We challenge the government to lift the state of emergency,
because even that has failed to break the resistance of the
people,'' said Mohammed Valli, a former detainee and a spokesman for
the banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition.
   Valli and other speakers at a Johannesburg news conference
reiterated a call for the government to free all being held without
charge. Some have been in custody the entire 1,000 days under
emergency regulations.
   A group of detainees began a hunger strike Jan. 23, demanding to
be released or put on trial. Hundreds in custody joined the strike,
and Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said Feb. 16 he would
release a ``substantial number'' of detainees within two weeks.
   The government says it has freed 279 people held in South African
prisons since then, and more than 500 people remain in detention.
   The Hunger Strike Support Committee said 202 detainees have been
released and about 700 remain in prison. Many of those released have
been placed under tight restrictions that limit their movements and
prohibit them from participating in anti-government groups.
   ``Anger is growing among detainees, their parents, mass-based
organizations and the community as a whole at Vlok's failure to
honor his agreement,'' the Support Committee said in a statement.
   ``The general impression created as a result of his talks with
lawyers, church leaders and detainees' parents was that well over
half of the detainee population would be released,'' the statement
added.
   More than 500 activists in detention have participated in the
hunger strike, but most resumed eating when Vlok promised the large
scale releases. However, detainees in Natal Province have continued
their fast and about 50 remain hospitalized nationwide, the Support
Committee said.
   The committee said detainees were considering rejoining the
hunger strike and that sympathy fasts were being planned around the
country.
   A spokesman for Vlok, Leon Mellet, said the law and order
minister was ``looking at each detainee's case individually.''
   An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been detained
for varying lengths of time under the state of emergency declared by
President P.W. Botha on June 12, 1986.
   The government has banned most black-led anti-apartheid groups
since the emergency went into effect.
   Some 4,000 people have died since widespread unrest erupted in
September 1984. Most deaths occurred before the nationwide state of
emergency was declared, although there has been ongoing
black-on-black faction fighting in Natal Province.
   Police said today five blacks were killed overnight in unrest
around the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg, where most of the
fighting has occurred.
   The state of emergency gives security forces widespread powers
and prohibits most forms of peaceful protest. Censorship rules
imposed under the emergency restrict reporting about unrest and
actions by security forces, but the measures have not been
comprehensively enforced.
