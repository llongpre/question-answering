   Three anti-apartheid leaders
taking refuge in the U.S. Consulate after escaping from detention
said Thursday they do not trust the government's promise not to
rearrest them.
   Colleagues of the activists, who had been detained without trial
for at least a year, said they may ask the United States to serve
as guarantor for an agreement that the three would remain free and
unrestricted if they leave their sanctuary.
   Firoz Cachalia, an associate of the three, said the government's
promises ``are not worth the paper they're written on.'' He said
the activists were likely to remain in the consulate until firm
guarantees could be obtained.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Wednesday the activists
would not be arrested if they left the consulate. A spokesman for
Vlok, Brig. Leon Mellet, said the three were now ``normal, free
people'' and would have been released shortly if they had not
escaped.
   The activists have not indicated when or if they will leave the
consulate, on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office building.
They have rejected proposals to leave the country in exchange for
freedom.
   The three said in a statement Thursday: ``It is clear that the
minister (Vlok) intends placing us under severe restrictions. We
consider bannings and house arrest just another form of detention.''
   ``The crucial question is what kind of freedom does the minister
envisage for us?'' they said. ``Is it the freedom he has imposed on
Albertina Sisulu and Raymond Suttner or is it the freedom which he
himself or any other Nationalist Party member enjoys?``
   Suttner, a white activist, was placed under severe restrictions
when he was released this month after 27 months in detention. Mrs.
Sisulu, wife of jailed African National Congress leader Walter
Sisulu, is barred from making public statements and from most
political activities.
   The banned ANC is the leading guerrilla organization fighting
white minority rule in South Africa.
   The escapees are Murphy Morobe, acting publicity secretary of
the banned United Democratic Front; Mohammed Valli Moosa, the
front's acting general secretary; and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of
the banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   Morobe, detained since July 1987, and Khanyile, detained since
December 1986, are black. Valli Moosa, arrested with Morobe, is
Indian.
   They slipped away from two police guards Tuesday while
undergoing physiotherapy at a hospital.
   The activists' lawyer, Krish Naidoo, said he had received no
official word from the government that the men were free. The
government said assurances to that effect were given to U.S.
officials.
   Prominent anti-apartheid leaders consulted with the trio
Thursday and Morobe was visited by his wife and two children.
   U.S. officials have said the activists will not be forced to
leave the consulate despite a worldwide U.S. policy of not formally
granting asylum in diplomatic offices.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods since June 1986, when the government declared a
state of emergency to control widespread black protests.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
