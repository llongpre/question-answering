   Thousands of blacks and whites
thronged to a cathedral today for the funeral of assassinated white
activist David Webster, then followed his coffin in one of the
largest anti-apartheid marches of the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   Mourners jogging behind the hearse and packed into buses gave
clenched fist salutes to passersby and chanted the initials of the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement as they
headed through central Johannesburg toward a cemetery six miles
away in a whites-only suburb.
   Webster, 44, was killed outside his home Monday by a man firing
a shotgun at close range from a passing car. Police have issued
sketches of three unidentified white men suspected in the killing,
which provoked grief and outrage throughout the anti-apartheid
movement.
   Webster, a professor of anthropology, was one of the few senior
white members of the predominantly black United Democratic Front, a
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   He was a prominent critic of the government's policy of
detention without trial and had researched the numerous unsolved
killings and abductions of anti-apartheid activists that have
occurred over the past decade.
   ``He helped us (blacks) realize there are white people who are
human beings,'' said the Rev. Frank Chikane, a black church leader,
at the three-hour funeral service. ``His life should be a message
to all white South Africans to rediscover the humanity that could
make this country free.''
   About 2,000 people filled St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral for the
funeral, while hundreds more stood outside, singing freedom songs
during the service.
   Eulogies for Webster were interspersed with performances by
white and black singers and a black jazz group. The mourners
included diplomats from more than a dozen Western countries, human
rights activists from across South Africa, residents of a remote
Zulu community where Webster conducted research, and fellow
supporters of a Soweto soccer team, the Orlando Pirates.
   The crowd included Raymond Suttner, another white,
anti-apartheid academic who was released last year after more than
two years in detention, and Johnny Clegg, South Africa's most
successful pop music star, who flew back from a tour in the United
States to pay tribute to a man whom he credited for helping to
inspire his Zulu-style rock 'n' roll.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, secretary-general of the United Democratic
Front, described Webster as ``a gallant soldier whose determination
to fight apartheid was more important than his life.''
   He said Webster's work in support of detainees over the past
three years, a period when about 30,000 activists have been held
for varying times without charge, ``denied the government the
ability to break our spirits.''
   ``It is widely suspected that the assassin is a member of the
police force ... maybe on duty outside this cathedral,'' Valli
Moosa said.
   Helen Joseph, an 84-year-old white activist the South African
media are not allowed to quote, said: ``The guilt for David's death
lies squarely on the shoulders of the National Party government.''
   Hundreds of policemen, including some in helicopters, were
deployed to monitor the funeral and the route along which 5,000
marchers and bus-riders traveled to West Park Cemetary.
   Anti-government parades are not allowed in South Africa, and
police have restricted most funerals of slain activists, placing
limits on the number of mourners, the content of speeches, and size
of the funeral procession.
   But at Webster's funeral, policemen watched impassively as
hundreds of black youths marched and drove past chanting in support
of the African National Congress.
