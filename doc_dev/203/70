   The four anti-apartheid
activists who have taken refuge in the U.S. consular offices are
testing the diplomatic skills of their hosts.
   Since the first three activists escaped 12 days ago to consular
sanctuary 11 stories above downtown Johannesburg, the activists
have demanded the release of all detainees and an end to South
Africa's state of emergency.
   The white-dominated South African government, in contrast to its
usual confrontational tactics, has waged a public relations
campaign to make itself appear reasonable.
   It says the first escapees _ well-known anti-apartheid leaders
who were in custody at least 14 months without charge _ are free to
walk away without fear of arrest.
   ``They are free men and we have no further interest in them
whatsoever,'' said Leon Mellet, the Law and Order Ministry
spokesman.
   Police say the fourth man, who escaped last Wednesday, faces a
possible charge of illegal weapons possession.
   Each of the four escaped from Johannesburg Hospital, where
police kept them under guard through use of national emergency laws
that give authorities powers to limit, among other things, freedom
of speech, press and assembly.
   So far, U.S. diplomats have said the activists can remain
indefinitely, but they also have barred them from direct contact
with journalists.
   John Dugard, a human rights lawyer in Johannesburg, supported
the activists' demand for written assurances they will not be
harmed but doubted the government would hold to its pledge to leave
them alone.
   ``I don't believe that for a moment,'' Dugard said. ``But it
might be argued that by staying in the consulate they are
restricting themselves.''
   Mellet said, ``Tthe three have become an embarrassment not only
for themselves, but for the Americans as well.''
   South African officials have issued one mild complaint about the
U.S. decision to provide temporary refuge, but stronger comments
have come from black activist Winnie Mandela and Sen. Edward
Kennedy.
   Kennedy said Thursday in Washington the escapees ``provide
compelling evidence that the people of South Africa, in their
struggle to end apartheid, still look to the American people for
support.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   The escapees are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, senior
leaders of the banned United Democratic Front, a nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned
National Education Crisis Committee.
   They were joined Wednesday by Clifford Ngcobo, an activist from
Soweto who alleges he was assaulted by police following his
detention in April.
   This is the first publicized sanctuary case at a U.S. mission in
South Africa, although there have been comparable cases at other
missions.
   Six activists stayed at the British Consulate in Durban for
several weeks in 1984 before emerging to face arrest for high
treason. The charges later were withdrawn.
   In 1987, South Africa allowed a Dutchman, Klaus de Jonge, to
return to the Netherlands after being holed up in a Dutch Embassy
office in Pretoria for two years. De Jonge escaped into the office
after being arrested for aiding the outlawed African National
Congress.
   The U.S. Embassy has expressed ``high regard'' for the activists
and promised they would not be forced out of the consulate, but
subsequent U.S. statements have been politically neutral,
belittling neither the activists nor South African authorities.
   Edward Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa,
has engaged in behind-the-scenes negotiations about the standoff
but has made no public comments, in keeping with the low profile he
has maintained throughout his two years here.
   Supporters of the escapees, while grateful for the sanctuary at
the consulate, have voiced annoyance at the Americans' efforts to
minimize controversy.
   Said Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela: ``We would like to see the Americans a
little more committed than they are.''
   One U.S. official said the Americans relieved because the
criticism from militants ``could have been a lot stronger.''
