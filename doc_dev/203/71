   A former policeman who has
admitted killing anti-apartheid activists said today that during
his eight years on the force he made only one arrest, but kidnapped
and killed often.
   Butana Nofomela testified that he was trained at a special
police base in 1980 to ``kidnap, ambush and shoot'' members of the
African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress, two
black guerrilla groups fighting the white-led government.
   Nofomela, on death row for a killing with no political
overtones, testified in Pretoria at a judicial inquiry into
allegations that the national police and military operated hit
squads against anti-apartheid activists.
   The head of the investigating commission, Supreme Court Justice
Louis Harms, asked Nofomela why he kidnapped people instead of
arresting them.
   ``In most cases, we were not instructed to arrest .... We were
instructed to kidnap,'' Nofomela replied.
   Asked if he arrested anyone during his eight years as a
policeman, Nofomela said, ``Only once. All other times I kidnapped.
I kidnap and kill.''
   Nofomela detailed several killings, including the 1981 stabbing
death of black anti-apartheid attorney Griffiths Mxenge. Earlier
this year, Nofomela pleaded guilty to the killing.
   ``Money benefits were promised to me'' for the killings,
Nofomela said. ``Bonuses were rated on how important the person was
who was to be eliminated or kidnapped.''
   Nofomela provoked a storm of controversy in October when he
confessed, the night before he was scheduled to hang, that he had
participated in police death squads. Nofomela's execution has been
postponed indefinitely while the death squad allegations are being
investigated.
   Two other former policemen, a black man and a white captain,
subsequently acknowledged participating in the alleged hit squads
along with Nofomela, who is black. All three have said they acted
on orders from their superiors.
   Police have denied authorizing murders. However, police have
said they suspect a covert military unit, the Civil Cooperation
Bureau, was involved in the killing of at least two anti-apartheid
figures.
   Activists say they believe the security forces were involved in
the unsolved killings of at least 60 government opponents in the
past decade.
   Maj. Gen. Joep Joubert testified Tuesday that the military
approved plans in 1985 for undercover agents to go abroad and
disrupt ANC operations. Several prominent ANC officials outside
South Africa have been assassinated or had attempts on their lives
in recent years, and the cases have never been solved.
   The ANC and the smaller PAC were legalized last month by
President F.W. de Klerk. Thousands of exiles belonging to the
groups are expected to begin returning to South Africa shortly.
   The military has said the secret bureau had 139 members, an
annual budget of $11 million and was in engaged in highly sensitive
intelligence gathering operations in South Africa and abroad.
   Yet top military and government officials have claimed they had
no knowledge of the bureau until recently.
   No military officers have been charged in connection with the
activities of the bureau, but two men have been detained for
questioning, and police are searching for several former police
officers in connection with two assassinations.
