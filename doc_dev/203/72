<HEAD>Police Ban University Rally in Support Of Detainees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Police today banned a rally at
a university intended to show solidarity with black detainees who
have staged hunger strikes to protest being held without charge.
   More than 300 people, mostly students, had gathered in an
auditorium at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg
when police officers entered the hall and said the meeting had been
banned.
   Riot police were deployed in a nearby street, but no disturbances
were reported.
   Student leaders, faculty members and administrators from at least
five universities have fasted for varying periods in support of the
hunger strikers.
   Hundreds of detainees have gone on hunger strikes at several
prisons across the country over the past four weeks to demand that
the government free them or charge them.
   At several prisons, the strikes have been suspended because of a
government pledge to release many detainees. The protests continue
at other prisons, but the police and anti-apartheid groups say they
are not sure how many detainees are involved.
   At least 58 detainees, not all of them hunger strikers, have been
freed since Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok met last week with
anti-apartheid church leaders. Vlok pledged to free ``a substantial
number'' of detainees, and the clergymen called on the hunger
strikers to suspend their fast.
   Vlok says less than 1,000 people are being held under
state-of-emergency regulations, which allow indefinite detention
without trial. Many of the hunger strikers have been held more than
two years.
   The Star newspaper reported today that 17 detainees held under
security legislation at Johannesburg's police headquarters had begun
a hunger strike. Unlike state-of-emergency detainees, prisoners
detained under security laws ostensibly are held in order to be
interrogated.
