   A fourth anti-apartheid
activist escaped detention and took refuge in the U.S. Consulate,
where three other activists have been holed up for 10 days, a U.S.
spokesman said today.
   Police issued an arrest warrant for Clifford Ngcobo, who fled
Wednesday while being treated at Johannesburg Hospital and went to
the American consulate on the 11th floor of a downtown Johannesburg
office tower. Authorities later said the warrant had been suspended.
   Ngcobo claims he was assaulted by police the night he was
detained.
   The consulate, which has been providing refuge to three other
activists who escaped last week, decided to allow Ngcobo to remain,
U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis said in Pretoria.
   All four detainees escaped guards while undergoing physiotherapy
treatment at Johannesburg Hospital.
   Black activist Winnie Mandela visited the consultate Wednesday
and complained U.S. officials would not let the detainees make
direct contact with reporters.
   The 30-year-old Ngcobo, active in the anti-apartheid Soweto
Civic Association, had been held five months, said attorneys at the
Cheadle, Thompson law firm that represents Ngcobo.
   An affidavit has been filed in which Ngcobo alleges he was
assaulted by police the night of his detention, the attorneys said.
At the recommendation of a doctor, Ngcobo was hospitalized four
days after he was detained, the lawyers added.
   Zavis said he could give no details of the escape nor whether
American diplomats had contacted the South African government about
the newcomer. There was no immediate comment from government
officials.
   ``The South African Police considers (Ngcobo) as an ordinary
accused in a criminal case, and he will be treated in accordance
with normal legal procedure,'' police said.
   Police have not accused Ngcobo of any crime but said they were
investigating charges of illegal possession of weapons and
intimidation.
   Two leaders of the banned United Democratic Front, the country's
largest multiracial anti-apartheid alliance, and another activist
have been inside the consulate since Sept. 13.
   The three, two black men and an ethnic Indian, have issued
statements demanding release of all political detainees and have
refused to leave the consulate despite a promise from the white
minority government that they will not be arrested again or
restricted.
   They have given no indication how long they plan to stay.
   U.S. officials say the activists will not be expelled from the
consulate, despite a worldwide U.S. policy of refusing asylum in
its diplomatic missions.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela, visited the activists Wednesday before Ngcobo arrived.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no say in
national affairs.
   In another development, police placed restrictions on three
black activists with the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
the country's largest black labor federation. The three were to
take part in a national anti-apartheid unity conference this
weekend in Cape Town.
   The police orders prohibit the trio from leaving their home
towns and require they remain in their residences from dusk to dawn
through Oct. 3.
   Also, the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa said
police detained two of their officials Wednesday. Eleven others
expected to participate in the conference were detained Wednesday.
   About 30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths under
the 27-month state of emergency. The government declared the
emergency in an effort to end black protests against apartheid.
