<HEAD>CIA Chief: Noriega Capture Over-Emphasized by Administration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration was wrong to place so
much importance on capturing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega after U.S.
troops invaded Panama, CIA Director William Webster says.
   ``Actually, Noriega was not a factor from the time the first
paratrooper landed in Panama,'' Webster said Tuesday night during a
question-and-answer session with students at American University.
   Webster's remarks seem to criticize President Bush, who made the
arrest of the military leader the focal point of the invasion of
Panama in December. Noriega already had been indicted on federal
drug trafficking charges in Florida.
   But Webster said Noriega ceased to be an issue once the United
States invasion had begun and he effectively had been removed from
power.
   ``I think we made a mistake in overemphasizing the importance of
Noriega,'' the intelligence official said.
   In an Oval Office address after the invasion, Bush said: ``As
president, I have no higher obligation than to safeguard the lives
of American citizens. And that is why I directed our armed forces
to protect the lives of American citizens in Panama and to bring
General Noriega to justice in the United States.''
   When Noriega evaded capture, the United States eventually put a
$1 million reward on his head. In addition to wanting him out of
power in Panama, the U.S. government wanted him jailed to face the
drug charges.
   Webster said that because Noriega had experience in
intelligence, keeping track of him was not easy. He changed
locations and cars and had people watching the spies who were
watching him, the CIA director said.
   Despite that, Webster said, ``we had very good intelligence
about Noriega.''
   But Noriega slipped through the U.S. grasp when he hurried to an
appointment his trackers hadn't counted on.
   ``It's remarkable we had him in focus seven times on the day of
the invasion, and it was only his decision to have a dalliance with
a lady of the street _ we should have predicted it,'' Webster said.
   After a few days on the run, Noriega turned up at the Vatican
embassy in Panama City, where he was sheltered for days until a
deal was worked out to allow his transfer to U.S. custody.
   Noriega now is in a federal prison near Miami awaiting trial.
   Webster's remarks Tuesday are the second time in recent weeks he
has publicly disagreed with others in the administration.
   He and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney have been carrying on a
public debate over what future military threat the Soviet Union
poses since the Warsaw Pact has become impotent with the removal of
communist governments in Eastern Europe.
   Webster has argued that the threat is significantly diminished,
while Cheney contends the United States still needs to maintain a
strong military to meet a possible challenge from the East.
   On Tuesday, Webster described Cheney as a friend with whom he
has breakfast once a week and said the disagreement was ``largely
generated because of the budget process we are going through.''
