   President P.W. Botha today
extended the two-year nationwide state of emergency for another
year and tightened curbs on press coverage of opposition activity.
   Anti-apartheid leaders assailed the proclamation, which will
leave hundreds of prominent activists in jail without charge.
   The emergency regulations allow sweeping powers of detention,
outlaw many forms of peaceful anti-government protest and restrict
freedom of speech, press and assembly.
   White women from the Black Sash civil rights group stood along
highways in Johannesburg during the morning rush hour with posters
saying: ``Apartheid is the emergency.'' A multiracial crowd of 100
attended a vigil for the estimated 2,500 emergency detainees at
Johannesburg's Central Methodist Church.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said extension of the emergency
``is a pointless and bankrupt exercise'' which ``aggravates South
Africa's crisis.''
   The Reagan administration had only a brief comment on the latest
development.
   ``This action underscores the need for a dialogue between the
government and the black opposition to bring about a fully
functioning non-racial democracy,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   In Tokyo, the Japanese government today criticized the extention
and urged South Africa to release political prisoners, permit
anti-apartheid activities and talk with the opposition.
   The outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, in a
statement from its headquarters in Zambia, said the government
sought ``to ensure its survival by continuing to resort to the most
brutal repression.''
   The ANC called for comprehensive, mandatory sanctions against
South Africa and said its guerrillas must escalate their attacks.
   Botha's announcement came two days after blacks ended their
biggest and longest general strike against the white-controlled
government. Black labor federations said today that about 2,000
workers who joined the protest have been fired and 1,000 more
subjected to various disciplinary actions.
   The new emergency decree took effect immediately upon government
publication. New press restrictions will bar all media from quoting
any member of an outlawed or restricted organization and require
local news agencies to register with the government.
   These domestic news agencies, many of them aggressive in their
coverage of anti-apartheid activity, could be ordered to submit all
their dispatches to a government censor before publication, the
regulations say.
   Journalists are already restricted in coverage of unrest,
security force action, treatment of emergency detainees and a wide
range of political statements the government considers subversive.
   Another section gives the government power to extend the
suspenions of two anti-apartheid newspapers, New Nation and South,
which were closed down in recent months. New Nation's editor,
Zwelakhe Sisulu, has been detained without charge since December
1986.
   ``It is indeed the aspiration of the government that conditions
will change to such an extent that the declared state of emergency
can be lifted,'' Botha said in a statement.
   ``We might just as well prepare ourselves for a permanent state
of emergency,'' independent member of Parliament Jan van Eck told a
gathering in Johannesburg on Thursday. ``A minority regime will not
be able to govern this country without the very wide and very
arbitrary powers afforded by the state of emergency.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Despite banning of apartheid groups and restrictions on their
leaders, more than 2 million blacks stayed away from work, school
and shops from Monday to Wednesday. The strike was called to
protest these restrictions and oppose labor legislation that could
weaken black unions.
   Botha declared the nationwide emergency on June 12, 1986, after
two years of violence that claimed 1,700 lives.
   In February, 17 anti-apartheid organizations, including the
nationwide United Democratic Front coalition, were banned from all
political activity. The two front presidents and treasurer, the
last executive members not in hiding or in detention, were banned
from giving speeches or news interviews.
   About 40,000 people, including 10,000 children, have been
detained during the past two years, according to the now-banned
Detainees Parents Support Committee. They estimate 2,500 people are
still in prison.
   The government has refused to give definitive numbers of people
in detention.
