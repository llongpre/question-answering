   U.S. officials today said they
turned away a black fugitive who sought to join four escaped
activists taking refuge at the U.S. Consulate.
   The 22-year-old man, identified as Max Mankazana, later was
taken into custody by South African police, according to his father.
   Barry Walkley, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said the man appeared
at the consulate about 3 a.m. Thursday and appealed for refuge.
   ``While we have deep compassion for the conditions involved, it
was clear to all parties that the situation did not correspond to
that of the others granted temporary refuge,'' Walkley said. ``The
person voluntarily left the area.''
   Three of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists
have been encamped at the consulate since Sept. 13, when they
slipped away from guards while undergoing therapy at a hospital.
All three had been detained without charge for more than a year.
   On Wednesday, a fourth activist, Clifford Ngcobo, joined them
after a similar escape.
   The four were to be visited today by Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu.
   Walkley did not specify why the United States viewed Mankazana's
case differently from the others. Police have not said why they
were pursuing the young man, but he had not been in detention,
unlike the other four, who are known political activists.
   Ngcobo, 30, said in a court affidavit that he was assaulted by
police when he was detained April 23, his lawyers said. They said
he was to be examined soon by doctors.
   Ngcobo told the liberal Weekly Mail newspaper he was beaten and
urinated blood for weeks after the alleged assault. The Weekly Mail
said its reporter spoke to Ngcobo at Johannesburg Hospital only
hours before he escaped.
   South African authorities on Thursday issued, then later
withdrew, an arrest warrant for Ngcobo. He has not been charged
with any crime.
   The government has said it will not act against the three
activists who escaped to the consulate last week.
   They are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, leaders of the
banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned
National education Crisis Committee.
   The three have called for the release of all political detainees
and have refused to leave the consulate despite the government
assurances.
   U.S. officials say the activists will not be expelled from the
consulate, despite a worldwide policy of not granting asylum in
U.S. diplomatic missions.
   In another development, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said
seven people had been arrested in connection with the bombing
Wednesday of the main white bus terminal in Johannesburg that
injured 19 people.
   Vlok did not identify the seven, but said they were members of
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, which
seeks to oust the white-led government.
   Police also blamed the ANC for a pre-dawn bombing Thursday at a
Johannesburg disco that injured 19 blacks. Police offered no
explanation as to why the ANC would target a club frequently almost
exclusively by blacks.
