   Representatives of big
business failed to persuade black labor unions on Thursday to
abandon a three-day protest next week that is expected to take the
form of a general strike.
   The two largest black labor federations have called for a
peaceful, nationwide protest June 6-8 to express opposition to
government crackdowns on anti-apartheid groups and to a proposed
labor bill that would curtail unions' ability to hold legal strikes.
   The federations cannot legally endorse a general strike, but
their previous calls for national protests have resulted in
widespread work stoppages. Leading anti-apartheid clergymen have
endorsed the federations' latest appeal.
   Leaders of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the
largest union federation, met Thursday with a committee
representing major employer organizations and headed by Bobby
Godsell of Anglo American Corp.
   The federation's general secretary, Jay Naidoo, told reporters
the protest will go ahead as planned because the business officials
failed to ease union concerns about the proposed labor legislation.
   ``We maintain that the bill represents a major rollback of the
rights of workers,'' Naidoo said.
   Godsell said the bill is not ``union-bashing'' legislation. He
also said the federation officials refused to promise him that next
week's protest would not include stayaways.
   Federation leaders arranged a meeting Thursday with the South
Africa Consultative Committee on Labor Affairs, which represents
major employer organizations. The talks included management
representatives from the country's leading industries, such as
mining, metals and manufacturing.
   Officials of the Congress of South African Trade Unions met
Wednesday with the National Council of Trade Unions, the second
largest labor federation. The two groups, which have differed over
political ideology, agreed to cooperate in promoting the protest.
   The Congress says it has 691,000 dues-paying members. The
Council claims more than 400,000 members.
   Police officials said the union groups are being monitored to
see if they violated state-of-emergency prohibitions on promotion
of political strikes and boycotts. Some employers have threatened
to dock wages, take disciplinary action and withdraw from wage
negotiations if workers take part in a stayaway.
   In February the government banned the Congress of South African
Trade Unions and 17 other anti-apartheid organizations from taking
part in politics.
   A main federation target is the proposed Labor Relations
Amendment, which would make it harder for unions to strike, outlaw
sympathy strikes and hold unions liable for losses suffered by
employers during an illegal strike.
   Unions charge that major businesses have not used their
influence to oppose the measure, now before Parliament.
   At the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, police
fired rubber bullets into the air Thursday to disperse hundreds of
college students demonstrating against government detentions of
anti-apartheid activists.
   There were no injuries or arrests, Vice Chancellor Mervyn Shear
said. He said that the students had engaged in a ``perfectly
peaceful protest.''
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying
lengths of time since the government declared a state of emergency
in June 1986 following anti-apartheid violence.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
