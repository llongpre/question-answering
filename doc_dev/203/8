   Thousands of black and white
mourners Saturday staged the largest anti-apartheid march of the
3-year-old state of emergency, chanting through whites-only suburbs
in a funeral procession for an assassinated white activist.
   Young blacks gave clenched fist salutes, waved banners and sang
in support of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement as they jogged in unison behind the hearse or perched atop
overflowing buses for a six-mile journey from a downtown cathedral
to a cemetery.
   David Webster, 44, was killed outside his home Monday by a
shotgun blast fired at close range from a passing car. Police have
issued sketches of three unidentified white men suspected in the
killing, which provoked grief and anger throughout the
anti-apartheid movement.
   A professor of anthropology, Webster was one of the few senior
white members of the predominantly black United Democratic Front, a
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition. He was a leading critic of
detention without trial and had researched the numerous unsolved
killings and abductions of anti-apartheid activists that have
occurred over the past decade.
   ``He helped us realize there are white people who are human
beings,'' said the Rev. Frank Chikane, a black church leader, at a
three-hour funeral service at St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral. ``His
life should be a message to all white South Africans to rediscover
the humanity that could make this country free.''
   More than 2,000 people of all races filled the cathedral.
Hundreds more stood outside, singing freedom songs.
   Hundreds of policemen, some in helicopters, monitored the
funeral and the route which the roughly 5,000 marchers and
bus-riders took to West Park Cemetery. Police stayed away from the
gravesite, where four young blacks unfurled a large ANC flag after
hiding their faces.
   Other youths joined clergymen in sprinkling dirt onto the wooden
coffin after it was lowered into the grave. Said one of the
ministers, veteran white activist Beyers Naude: ``David is saying
`Stop the violence, stop the killings, stop the injustice.'''
   Anti-government parades are illegal in South Africa, and most
funerals of slain activists have been restricted by police during
the emergency, with limits placed on the number of mourners,
content of speeches, and size of the funeral procession.
   But Webster's funeral was not restricted, and policemen watched
impassively as throngs of militant mourners paraded past them.
   At the cathedral, eulogies were interspersed with performances
by white and black singers and a black jazz group. The mourners
included diplomats from the United States and other Western
countries, human rights activists from across South Africa,
residents of a remote Zulu community where Webster conducted
research, and fellow supporters of a Soweto soccer team, the
Orlando Pirates.
   Those in the crowd included Raymond Suttner, a white
anti-apartheid academic freed last year after two years in
detention; Johnny Clegg, South Africa's most successful pop music
star, who flew back from a U.S. tour to honor Webster; and Winnie
Mandela, wife of jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, a United Democratic Front official and
former detainee, described Webster as ``a gallant soldier whose
determination to fight apartheid was more important than his life.''
   He said Webster's support of detainees during the emergency, in
which about 30,000 activists have been held without charge for
varying periods, ``denied the government the ability to break our
spirits.''
   Helen Joseph, an 84-year-old white activist whom South African
media are not allowed to quote, was the first speaker.
   ``The guilt for David's death lies squarely on the shoulders of
the National Party government,'' she said.
