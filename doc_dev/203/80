   The government today mocked
three escaped detainees holed up in the U.S. Consulate, calling
them failed martyrs, and it pledged to leave them alone if they
left the building.
   But the Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent anti-apartheid leader,
said the three have ``no faith whatsoever'' in the government's
pledge.
   The prominent anti-apartheid leaders escaped to the consulate
Tuesday after slipping away from police guards while undergoing
physiotherapy at a hospital. Each had been held at least 14 months
without trial.
   So far, they have spurned the government's offer to let them
leave the consulate without fear of being arrested again. They are
seeking assurances, possibly guaranteed by the United States, that
they will not be detained or restricted in any way if they leave.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, in a statement today, said he had
told U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins that the South African
government ``was not interested'' in the activists.
   ``As far as I am concerned, they are merely guests of the
American consul-general at the expense of the American taxpayer,''
Botha said. ``They are deeply disappointed that they did not
succeed in becoming martyrs and the fact that they will have to
leave the U.S. consulate-general with their tails between their
legs, with all of South Africa laughing at them.''
   But Boesak, who met with the activists, said they did not
believe the government.
   ``The government is not to be trusted,'' said Boesek, president
of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   Many activists, once freed from detention, have been placed
under restrictions limiting their freedom of movement and barring
them from political activities. The Foreign Affairs Department said
this would not happen in the case of the three escapees.
   ``There can be no intention to limit them in terms of talking to
the press or their political activity,'' a Botha spokesmen, Roland
Darroll, told The Associated Press.
   But Boesak said several activists, including Aubrey Mokoena,
head of the ``Release (Nelson) Mandela Campaign'' had been placed
under restrictions in the past 24 hours.
   ``How can we accept the word (of Minister of Law and Order
Adriaan Vlok) when he offers to let (three detainees) walk out of
here free while banning other people on the same day?'' Boesak said.
   The escapees are Murphy Morobe, acting publicity secretary of
the banned United Democratic Front; Mohammed Valli Moosa, the
front's acting general secretary; and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of
the banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   Morobe and Khanyile are black. Valli Moosa is Indian.
   The activists have not indicated when or if they will leave the
consulate, on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office building.
They rejected proposals to be flown to another country.
   U.S. officials say the activists will not be forced to leave the
consulate, despite a worldwide U.S. policy of not formally granting
asylum in diplomatic offices. South Africa would need U.S.
permission to enter the premises.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
