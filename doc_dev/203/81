<HEAD>Murder Charge Dropped Against Irishman Held Since September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>

   An Irish citizen held since September
in connection with the assassination of white SWAPO leader Anton
Lubowski was freed Monday after the murder charge against him was
dropped.
   Donald Acheson was arrested Sept. 13, the day after Lubowski was
assassinated outside his home. Lubowski was the only white
executive member of the South-West Africa People's Organization
that won last November's elections and became the ruling party in
the newly independent country.
   ``I never did this crime whatsoever and I just want to get out
... out of it,'' Acheson said after he was released.
   He refused to comment when asked if he had worked for the South
African Defense Force's Civil Cooperation Bureau. The secret
organization has been implicated by South African police in the
deaths of Lubowski and a Johannesburg university academic, David
Webster, last May.
   Namibian police issued warrants this year for the arrest of
several former South African police who were members of the Civil
Cooperation Bureau. The men went into hiding and emerged after
March 21, when Namibia became independent from South Africa and the
warrants became invalid.
   The two countries have no extradition treaty.
   Acheson said he came to Namibia last September to look for a job
as a newspaper cartoonist but found none. He said he had previously
done work for Britsh newspapers and U.S. magazines.
   Acheson's passport was returned to him and his lawyer said he
would probably fly Thursday to West Germany before returning to
South Africa where he has a fiancee. Achesion also said he was
considering returning to Ireland, which he said he left ``too many
years ago.''
