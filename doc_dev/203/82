   Police continued a nationwide
crackdown on government opponents Thursday, but they backtracked on
a detainee who escaped and joined three other activists holed up at
the U.S. Consulate.
   Police issued, then withdrew an arrest warrant for Clifford
Ngcobo, who escaped Wednesday while being treated at a hospital and
fled to the 11th-floor consulate in a downtown Johannesburg office
building.
   Consular officials, who have provided refuge for three prominent
activists since their escape Sept. 13, allowed Ngcobo to remain
while his case is assessed, U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis
said.
   Police have pledged not to arrest the three initial escapees if
they leave the consulate, but Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
said a multipronged crackdown against other activists is under way.
   Across the country this week, more than two dozen activists have
been detained or barred from political activities, offices of
anti-apartheid groups have been raided, and pedestrians and
motorists in urban centers have been subjected to random searches.
   The crackdown comes during an increase in bombings, including
five in a nine-hour span late Wednesday and early Thursday.
Authorities said 38 people were injured, including 18 whites at a
Johannesburg bus terminal and 19 blacks eight hours later at a
disco on the other side of the city.
   The owner of the disco said three white men entered, then left
without drinking any of the beers they had ordered, shortly before
the explosion.
   Police blame most recent bombings on the outlawed African
National Congress, the major guerrilla group fighting
white-minority rule. But activists believe right-wing vigilantes or
a covert security force unit carried out the recent bombing of a
Johannesburg building used by anti-apartheid groups.
   Vlok said the security crackdown was intended to counter an
alleged campaign to disrupt nationwide municipal elections next
month.
   Activists advocate a boycott of the elections and say the
segregated black council seats at stake are components of a
white-controlled system that excludes blacks from central
government.
   Police also have been targeting activists expected to
participate in a national anti-apartheid conference this weekend in
Cape Town. The main sponsor of the conference, the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, said Thursday that eight of its members
were detained and four barred from leaving the Johannesburg area.
   Ngcobo, 30, was active in the anti-apartheid Soweto Civic
Association and had been held since April 23, his attorneys said.
   Ngcobo alleged that he was assaulted by police on the night of
his detention, and he was hospitalized four days after he was
detained, the attorneys said.
   Police issued an arrest warrant for Ngcobo on Thursday and said
he was wanted for illegal weapons possession and intimidation, but
several hours later the Foreign Affairs Department said the warrant
was suspended.
   The department said the case against Ngcobo dealt only with
weapons possession, not with any other alleged offense, and was
referred to the attorney general for consideration.
   Authorities did not elaborate on what would happen to Ngcobo if
he left his refuge.
   The government has said it will act against the three activists
who escaped to the consulate last week.
   They are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, leaders of the
banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned
National education Crisis Committee.
   The three eluded guards while receiving physiotherapy at
Johannesburg Hospital, the same facility that Ngcobo escaped from.
   The three have called for the release of all political detainees
and have refused to leave the consulate despite the government
assurances.
   U.S. officials say the activists will not be expelled from the
consulate despite a worldwide policy of not granting asylum in U.S.
diplomatic missions.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
