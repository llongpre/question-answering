   Thirteen blacks were killed in
townships outside four Natal province cities, police said Monday.
Residents said most were killed and mutilated in factional fighting
over land.
   Also on Monday, police fired tear gas and sprayed purple dye
from a water cannon at students who gathered at the University of
Durban to protest the expulsion of 150 students who couldn't pay
their fees, students and teachers said. Two students were injured
and hospitalized.
   Police said university authorities called them to the campus
because students wielding knives had surrounded a post office
employee collecting money from telephone booths.
   A black candidate in upcoming municipal elections was
assassinated Saturday in Soweto, a black township of Johannesburg,
police said. The elections are opposed by many anti-apartheid
organizations.
   An estimated 600 blacks have died in factional violence in the
Natal province in the past 18 months. Most of the fighting has been
between supporters of the banned United Democratic Front, a
multiracial anti-apartheid federation, and members of the more
conservative Zulu political organization, Inkatha.
   Residents and independent groups said the fighting Sunday in
Molweni, near Durban, stemmed from land disputes. Thousands of
blacks lost their homes in flooding a year ago and have been moving
from town to town, settling wherever they find unused land.
   The fighting also reportedly involved disputes between the
United Democratic Front against traditional village leaders and
vigilantes. The residents and independent monitoring groups said
those killed were disemboweled, and one handicapped man who was
killed had his arm severed and taken away.
   The area has a long history of mutilation killings, which are
connected with sorcery in which parts of human bodies, particularly
those of enemies, are used to bring power and good luck.
   The daily unrest report from police headquarters, which gives
few details, said groups of blacks attacked and killed 10 other
blacks in three incidents at Molweni.
   Police also said they found the bodies of three black men in
different areas of Kwandegezi, a township near Durban. It was
assumed the deaths resulted from factional violence.
   Police on Monday reported the assassination of David Nkomo, 45,
a black candidate for the Soweto city council. The black-oriented
City Press newspaper said two men went to his home Saturday and
fired seven bullets, hitting him twice in the head.
   State-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest,
security force action, treatment of detainees, some forms of
protest and various statements the government considers subversive.
The regulations prohibit calls for election boycotts.
   The Oct. 26 municipal elections mark the first time all races in
the country will vote on the same day. Many blacks feel that
participation in governmental structures perpetuates apartheid, or
racial segregation in which the nation's 26 million blacks have no
voice in national affairs.
   In the last black municipal elections in 1984, less than 20
percent of blacks voted.
   The outlawed African National Congress, the main guerilla group
fighting to overthrow the government, has called for a boycott of
the elections.
