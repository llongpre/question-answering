   CIA Director William H. Webster foresees a
``deep and prolonged'' crisis in the Soviet Union, with a
deteriorating economy and ethnic unrest accompanying President
Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms.
   U.S. specialists on the Soviet Union generally agreed with the
assessment offered by Webster in a speech in Boston on Thursday,
although some said better times may be ahead for the Soviet economy.
   ``I would say it's just one side of the story,'' said Stephen F.
Cohen, professor of politics and director of Russian studies at
Princeton University. ``It's the downside of the story. I think
there's an upside of the story, too.''
   ``Generally, there is continued decline,'' said Vladimir Petrov,
professor emeritus of international affairs at George Washington
University. ``At least people complain more. But Russians are used
to deprivation. How long their patience will last is another
matter.''
   ``Some say that maybe they are coming to a turning point with
the economy in a year or two, but who can tell?'' Petrov added.
   Eric Green, Soviet analyst with the American Committee on U.S.
Soviet Relations, said, ``I think the events in the Soviet Union
would tend to justify that they are deteriorating. The one bright
spot is that talk is now turning toward really radical economic
reforms.''
   Webster, addressing the World Affairs Council of Boston, said,
``The crisis we now see in the U.S.S.R. will likely be deep and
prolonged.''
   ``Gorbachev's reforms have undermined the Stalinist system that
he inherited and have put the Soviet Union on the road to a new
political system, but the new system that he is trying to create is
not yet ready to take the place of the old one that he has
discarded,'' the CIA chief said.
   ``Economic conditions have deteriorated. Crime is increasing.
Ethnic turmoil is escalating. And now Moscow faces perhaps its
greatest challenge _ attempts by individual states to secede from
the union.''
   Speaking of Lithuania's declaration of independence, Webster
said, ``The situation is tense, and cool heads are needed all
around.''
   Regarding the Soviet economy, he said that ``attempts to head
off consumer discontent have met with very little success.''
   ``Gorbachev has some very unhappy consumers on his hands,''
Webster said.
   Analyst Green agreed, saying, ``They perceive that the situation
is getting worse in terms of food and it is exacerbated by the fact
their wages are increasing without any increase in goods to buy.
There are some indications that this could lead to widespread
unrest.''
   As to Gorbachev's future, Petrov said, ``Obviously, concern is
major. For a while he could get away with it because everybody
realized the economy was in such a mess that no one could be held
responsible. But now that he has achieved the ultimate power, he is
the man to point at.''
   On the other hand, Petrov said, ``To challenge him you would
need somebody and something which today in my view simply is not
available.''
   Webster also said that elections in Eastern Europe ``do not
guarantee an easy transition from communism.''
   ``They will have to be accompanied by tough reforms _ reforms
that are going to bring home the hardship of unemployment, higher
prices and inflation,'' he said.
   Webster said unemployment in Poland has jumped from 55,000 in
January to more than 250,000 and is expected to reach the million
mark by the end of the year.
