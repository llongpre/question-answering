   Members of outlawed
anti-apartheid groups said Thursday they would hold a series of
rallies this weekend, the latest phase in a new campaign to defy
government suppression of dissent.
   In Cape Town, police halted a march led by Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu in support of the opposition campaign.
   The police escorted Tutu and about 60 other people back to St.
George's Cathedral about 30 minutes after they began marching
through the city center protesting the arrests of former prisoners
who were defying restrictions imposed on them.
   Plans for the weekend rallies were announced at a news conference
at the Central Methodist Church in downtown Johannesburg.
Plainclothes police officers were present and confiscated a
reporter's tape-recording of the announcement.
   Titus Mafolo, an executive of the banned United Democratic Front,
said it was possible that police might arrest the five white, black
and Indian activists who announced the campaign while dressed in
United Democratic Front T-shirts. Such items are banned under the
government's emergency regulations.
   ``We don't plan our actions having that (detention) in mind.
Otherwise we wouldn't plan anything,'' Mafolo said.
   The United Democratic Front, a coalition of hundreds of church,
youth and labor groups that was banned in Feburary 1988, will lead
``all restricted organizations at a mass rally'' at the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg on Sunday, Mafolo said.
   ``All restricted organizations will consider themselves to be
free to operate and organize within their constituencies,'' he said.
   Sunday is the sixth anniversary of the founding of the United
Democratic Front.
   On Saturday, a banned white group affiliated with the United
Democratic Front ``will take the defiance campaign into the white
suburbs.'' He said members wearing United Democratic Front T-shirts
will distribute literature and sell the outlawed shirts outside a
shopping center in a northern Johannesburg neighborhood, said
Wilhelm Liebenberg of the Johannesburg Democratic Action Committee.
   The rallies are the latest phase in a campaign launched Aug. 3 to
defy apartheid laws and emergency restrictions that have forced most
anti-apartheid activists to operate underground. The campaign began
with blacks seeking treatment at white hospitals.
   The next step began when scores of activists who had been
released from detention began violating their restrictions, which
confined them to their homes at night, curtailed their political
activities, and required them to report daily to police stations.
The Department of Law and Order says it has arrested and charged
more than 30 former prisoners.
   Ephraim Nkoe, spokesman for the banned South African Youth
Congress, told reporters an estimated 1,000 people are under
restrictions. He said these were imposed by police seeking to
``maintain white rule and the oppression of the masses.''
   Organizers of the defiance campaign say they seek to avoid
violence. However, there have been almost daily confrontations in
the Cape Town area between mixed-race students and police in which
the youths have thrown stones and erected barricades in the streets
and the police have fired tear gas. The school violence spread to
Durban this week where it was met with police birdshot.
