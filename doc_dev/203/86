   Sidestepping an array of
state-of-emergency bans, the militant core of the anti-apartheid
movement is back on the offensive with a defiance campaign that has
government leaders groping for a response.
   Crushing the campaign by force could wreck the government's
ongoing initiatives to improve its international standing. Allowing
unchecked civil disobedience could fuel widespread black activism
and a white backlash against the governing National Party in
advance of parliamentary elections next month.
   The campaign, launched Wednesday when about 270 blacks and
Indians sought and received treatment at segregated white
hospitals, is led by many of the activists who have been detained
or restricted during the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   ``People have decided to take the matter into their own hands,''
said Essa Moosa, a lawyer involved in the campaign.
   The campaign's leaders have designated themselves and their
various organizations as the Mass Democratic Movement, a loose
alliance which in effect takes the place of the United Democratic
Front. The UDF was banned in February 1988, and by late last year,
activists were conceding that the emergency crackdown had seriously
weakened their organizational prowess.
   The first sign of a resurgence came in January, when UDF
affiliates helped organize hunger strikes by hundreds of detained
black activists. Faced with the prospect of detainees starving to
death without ever being charged, the government chose to free
virtually all those held under emergency regulations.
   Now comes the defiance campaign, which envisions the first
sustained use of mass civil disobedience in South Africa since the
1950s. Its masterminds are activists who have proved their
resilience and persistence.
   Two of the Mass Democratic Movement's key leaders are Murphy
Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, UDF officials who escaped from
detention to sanctuary at the U.S. Consulate last year. The
government allowed them to emerge without the restrictions imposed
on many other UDF leaders.
   Another key component of the new movement is the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, the main black labor federation, which
has defied a government decree barring it from political activity.
   The government may have trouble responding decisively to the
defiance campaign because of a partial power vaccuum at the top.
President P.W. Botha will retire after the Sept. 6 election, and
neither he nor his designated successor, F.W. de Klerk, has been
eager to make bold moves in recent weeks.
   The government's point man in coping with the defiance campaign
is Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok. He asserted last month the
organizers sought to provoke violence and had endorsed hand-grenade
attacks on election candidates.
   The Mass Democratic Movement denied the allegations and mocked
Vlok after the hospital protest proceeded peacefully, with minimal
disruption to health services.
   Vlok belittled the protest as ``political pestering'' but said
further acts of defiance ``are a time-bomb that could explode at
any moment.''
   Health Minister Willie van Niekerk complained that sick blacks
had been used as pawns and said no hospitals elsewhere in ``the
civilized world'' would be targeted by protesters. Anti-apartheid
leaders agreed, saying no civilized country's hospitals would be
racially segregated.
   The Mass Democratic Movement says the defiance campaign will be
extended soon to other targets, possibly segregated schools and
recreation facilities. Mineworkers have begun protesting workplace
segregation and 17 former detainees in Cape Town said they would
defy the restrictions imposed when they were freed.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, conceded in an
editorial Friday the activists ``scored a propaganda victory,
highlighting segregation at white hospitals, issuing defiant
statements and challenging the authorities without suffering any
serious consequences.''
   The Citizen said the government might regret its decision to
avoid a pre-emptive crackdown on the protest's organizers.
   The government's dilemma has been aggravated by the fact that
its current policy documents repudiate racial discrimination. Vlok
himself declared during the week that ``apartheid is no longer the
policy of the National Party.''
   If Vlok was speaking the truth, said Morobe, then the defiance
campaign would only be of help.
