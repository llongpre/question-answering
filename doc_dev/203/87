<HEAD>Ex-Policeman Says He Was Told to `Take Out' Black Activists</HEAD>

   A white ex-policeman claims
security forces battling unrest were told to kill anti-government
activists and routinely tortured and assaulted blacks at random,
according to documents.
   Sgt. Barney Horn, who quit the force in October after 13 years,
detailed alleged police misdeeds in a 25-page affidavit obtained by
The Associated Press Friday after his story appeared in the
Afrikaans-language newspaper Free Weekly.
   He is the fourth former policeman in recent months to speak out
about alleged police abuses.
   Horn said that when he was battling unrest near the southern
city of Port Elizabeth in 1984, members of the police Security
Branch circulated pictures of local anti-apartheid activists.
   ``We were told that these people had been identified as
instigators ... and if we saw them we had to take them out,'' Horn
said. ``Everyone present understood that to mean `kill them.'''
   In recent months, three former policemen _ one white and two
black, have said they were part of police hit squads that
assassinated anti-apartheid activists on orders from superiors.
   One of the men, Butana Nofomela, has pleaded guilty to killing
an anti-apartheid attorney in 1981. The two other men, who say they
were part of the same killing, have fled South Africa.
   Opposition groups say there have been more than 60 unsolved
killings of activists the past decade. The opposition has long
accused the security force of killing anti-government activists.
   President F.W. de Klerk said last month he would not appoint a
judicial commission to investigate the alleged police deaths
squads, a decision that has drawn widespread criticism.
   Horn alleged that when he worked in Boksburg, east of
Johannesburg, 90 percent of police interrogators tortured black
suspects. One of the most common methods was to place a wet bag
over the suspect's head so he could not breathe.
   It also was common practice to attach electrodes to suspects'
genitals and administer electric shocks during interrogation, Horn
said.
   When patrolling the townships, he said blacks ``would be
attacked by the (police) members at random ... hit with the long,
thick batons, kicked, punched, rifle-butted.''
   ``The members would jump into the vehicle, the vehicle would go
to another road and the same process would be repeated,'' he said.
``Plenty of people were injured this way. We were never ordered to
stop doing this.''
   Police headquarters in Pretoria said Horn's allegations would be
investigated ``at a high level without delay.''
   Horn left South Africa on a flight Thursday and fears his former
colleagues may try to harm him, said a source who has been in
contact with Horn.
   Horn said he spoke out because, ``to continue a Christian life,
I cannot have these skeletons hanging in my cupboard.''
   In a related development, a British citizen told the Free Weekly
newspaper that he bombed the London offices of the African National
Congress guerrilla movement in 1982 while working for the South
African police.
   Free Weekly said it interviewed Peter Casselton in Pretoria,
where he is in hiding and attempting to leave South Africa.
   Police have denied involvement in the bombing of the ANC office.
