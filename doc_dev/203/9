   A former narcotics detective
has been arrested in the assassinations of two prominent white
activists, one in South Africa and one in Namibia, police said
Thursday.
   Police headquarters refused to release the name of the
31-year-old suspect, saying it confirmed his arrest only after
newspapers reported it. An official statement said further arrests
in the slayings were possible.
   An evening news report on government-run TV said it was believed
police ``are looking at the possible existence of a private
assassination squad with strong right-wing links.''
   The suspect, a white former police sergeant, was arrested this
month in the killings of David Webster, a university lecturer and
human rights activist in Johannesburg, and Anton Lubowski, a lawyer
who was the only senior white official of Namibia's main
independence movement, the South-West Africa People's Organization.
   Both men were shot to death outside their homes; Webster on May
1 in Johannesburg and Lubowski on Sept. 12 in Windhoek, Namibia.
   The suspect had not been charged and was being held for
questioning under the provisions of security legislation that
allows for indefinite detention without access to visitors or
lawyers.
   The Star, a liberal Johannesburg daily, said the suspect's
father had filed an application demanding his son's release from a
Johannesburg police station cell, but later withdrew the request.
   Police said the suspect was discharged from the police force in
1984 after being sentenced to prison on charges of murder and
theft. He was convicted of killing a suspect in one of his
investigations as a narcotics officer for the West Rand, a region
west of Johannesburg.
   ``The person has been in detention for some time,'' police said.
``The police did not wish to announce his detention because this
would have jeopardized an investigation which still has to be
launched.''
   The national police force has come under widespread criticism
for its failure to solve the Webster murder and dozens of other
killings of anti-apartheid activists over the past 10 years.
   The arrest coincides with a government investigation into
allegations by former policemen that police death squads, acting on
orders from superiors, killed numerous government opponents.
   An Irish national, Donald Acheson, 51, was arrested in Namibia
the day after Lubowski was killed. He had been held as an illegal
immigrant, but on Nov. 6 was told he would be charged in the
slaying.
   Newspapers have reported that Acheson was taken to Johannesburg
for interrogation by authorities who fought the court application
for the ex-narcotics officer's release. Those authorities also are
investigating Webster's assassination.
   Also on Thursday:
   _ Scores of protesting black bakery workers in Pretoria
reportedly were injured and 200 arrested by riot police using tear
gas and clubs. Police said five officers were hurt by bread crates
hurled from rooftops.
   Hundreds of workers gathered at the Boerstra bakery in Pretoria
to protest working conditions. Neil Coleman, a spokesman for the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, said riot police attacked
the workers without provocation. Police said the protesters ignored
repeated warnings to disperse.
   _ Police in the impoverished township of Alexandra near
Johannesburg used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse 500
blacks protesting living conditions in their township. Four people
reportedly were arrested.
   _ Six anti-apartheid activists met with African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela and later said they did not believe
he would be freed from prison this year. Billy Nair, former Natal
province leader of the outlawed ANC military wing, did not comment
on the more prominent expectation that Mandela would be freed early
next year. President F.W. de Klerk said, ``The matter is receiving
attention. ... We will make an announcement when we are ready.''
   _ De Klerk prepared to travel to the Ivory Coast for a meeting
Friday with President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to discuss mutual
relations and the Angolan civil war. The two countries have no
formal diplomatic relations, but extensive trade ties.
Houphouet-Boigny condemns apartheid, South Africa's legal system of
racial separation, but criticizes as counterproductive sanctions to
force South Africa to give equal rights to its black majority.
