   A Supreme Court justice
appointed to investigate unsolved killings of anti-apartheid
activists said today he found no evidence the police or army
operated death squads.
   Government opponents who have long blamed the security forces
for the deaths of dozens of activists were certain to protest the
finding.
   In another development, police said today that seven blacks were
shot and stabbed to death in the troubled black townships outside
Johannesburg. An eighth death was reported in Wenbezi, northwest of
Durban.
   The finding on the death squads came from Supreme Court Justice
Louis Harms, the sole member of a government-appointed commission.
He described as unreliable three former policemen who said they
carried out more than 10 killings as part of authorized death
squads.
   Harms said killings described by the former policemen
``undoubtedly took place,'' but that ``it would be very difficult
in the extreme to prove the veracity of the allegations in criminal
proceedings.''
   Police and the military have denied the existence of death
squads. They said any criminal acts carried out against the
anti-apartheid camp were undertaken by individuals acting on their
own.
   Harms said there was a probability that police committed violent
crimes against members of black opposition groups such as the
African National Congress, which was legalized in February after
being outlawed for 30 years.
   But he added there was no evidence that ``a particular policeman
committed a particular crime of violence for a particular
purpose.''
   Another government commission that investigated the allegations
last year and released its findings Saturday reached the same
conclusion.
   Harms also said a covert military group, the Civil Cooperation
Bureau, had ``contaminated'' the whole security arm of the state
and there was reason to suspect it was involved ``in more crimes of
violence than the evidence shows.''
   Among the few operations the bureau admitted carrying out was
hanging a baboon fetus on the door of a home belonging to Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   Harms heard testimony from dozens of witnesses from March
through August as he examined more than 60 unsolved killings of
anti-apartheid activists. He said two 1986 slayings should be
investigated further by prosecutors but did not make such a
recommendation in any of the other killings.
   Former policeman Almond Nofomela caused the inquiries into the
alleged death squads Oct. 19, 1989, the day before he was scheduled
to be executed for a killing with no apparent political overtones.
   Nofomela said he and two former colleagues took part in many
killings and kidnappings authorized by superiors. The other two
fled the country, then said they had joined in the killings
described by Nofomela, who remains on death row.

   In the township violence, the worst fighting was in Katlehong,
southeast of Johannesburg, where police discovered five bodies this
morning with bullet and knife wounds.
   A police spokeswoman, Lt. Ida van Zweel, said the battles were
between rival Zulu and Xhosa residents of a squatter camp, who have
been fighting since Sunday. She said the bloodshed began after one
group demanded the other take part in a rent boycott.
   Authorities also found a body in Evaton and another in
Vosloorus, both south of Johannesburg.
   Meanwhile, police denied that they deliberately targeted Winnie
Mandela, wife of ANC leader Nelson Mandela, when they fired tear
gas on blacks in Atteridgeville township outside Pretoria on
Monday.
   A police spokesman, Maj. Reg Crewe, said tear gas was used to
disperse a stone-throwing crowd in the township, where police and
residents have clashed several times in recent days.
   Mrs. Mandela, who was visiting residents to show support, said:
``It is clear the attack was deliberately directed at me and my
delegation.''
   In another development, a white extremist testified he stabbed
and shot to death a black taxi driver because he needed practice
before embarking on a campaign to assassinate black leaders.
   ``It would be fatal to get cold feet if I had a leader in my
sights,'' Cornelius Lottering said Monday in the Johannesburg
Supreme Court, where he is on trial for murder.
   He has pleaded innocent, saying the killing was an act of war.
   White extremists upset by President F.W. de Klerk's political
reforms have vowed to fight rather than accept a black majority
government in South Africa.
