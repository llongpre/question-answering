   A human rights group on
Thursday praised the government's decision to look into alleged
police death squads, but said the security forces appear
increasingly unhappy with President F.W. de Klerk's reforms.
   De Klerk refused to call for such an inquiry in December but
reversed himself Wednesday and named a Supreme Court judge to probe
the charges. He also asked for a separate inquiry into the death of
a 20-year-old black man, found hanged Tuesday in his police cell.
   Anti-apartheid groups long have alleged that the security forces
were involved in the more than 60 unsolved killings of activists
during the 1980s.
   The Human Rights Commission, a private group led by
anti-apartheid activists, said de Klerk's reversal ``illustrated
clearly that sustained pressure both internally and internationally
against the system of apartheid continues to have its effect.''
   It said de Klerk was ``bringing to heel the security
apparatus,'' but added, ``The erratic performance of the security
forces suggests that there is disagreement and even rebellion
against the government's new survival-motivated policy of
presenting a clean image to the world.''
   De Klerk has allowed peaceful protests since shortly after
assuming power last August.
   Police, however, recently have resorted to tear gas, rubber
bullets and baton charges to break up peaceful demonstrations
considered illegal.
   Police Gen. Herman Stadler on Tuesday blamed an upsurge in
unrest on the government's more relaxed attitude toward political
dissent.
   De Klerk told top 500 police officials recently that the force
would no longer fight the government's political battles and should
stick to fighting crime.
   According to reports, police morale has suffered since the
controversy over the purported death squads broke out late last
year. Three former policemen have said they took part in killing
government opponents under authorization of their superiors.
   Police have denied that assassination squads exist.
   But last Oct. 19, the night before he was due to be hanged,
black former policeman Butana Almond Nofomela swore in an affidavit
he was part of a police death squad.
   Armed with the affidavit, human rights activists obtained a stay
of execution so Nofomela could help in investigations of death
squad activity.
   Nofomela, on death row for a killing with no apparent political
overtones, named two former policemen he said also participated in
the killings.
   The men, Dirk Coetzee, a white former captain, and David
Tshikalanga, who is black, fled South Africa and admitting taking
part in at least 10 killings.
   Coetzee is in Zimbabwe, and reportedly has joined the African
National Congress, the main black group fighting South Africa's
white-dominated government.
   In an interview with the Star newspaper of Johannesburg, Coetzee
was quoted as saying he welcomed a full investigation _ ``I hope
the whole thing will come out into the open now.''
   Nofomela recently pleaded guilty to the 1981 stabbing death of
black anti-apartheid attorney Griffiths Mxenge. Arrest warrants
were issued for Coetzee and Tshikalanga in the same case.
   Police meanwhile said Thursday that Pieter van der Merwe, a
20-year-old white soldier, has been arrested in connection with the
murders of three blacks who were abducted in a minibus, shot dead
and left at intervals along a highway near Klerksdorp, a mining
town 100 miles west of Johannesburg.
   He was identified as a conscript serving in an army artillery
brigade.
   Police gave no indication of a possible motive.
