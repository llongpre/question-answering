   GA-RANKUWA, South Africa (AP) _ A creation of apartheid
politics, South Africa's black medical school is producing 70 badly
needed doctors a year, and even those who oppose it concede it is
advancing black medicine in the country.
   South Africa has 26 million blacks but only about 800 black
doctors, as opposed to more than 21,000 white doctors among its 5
million whites.
   When the Medical University of Southern Africa was established
11 years ago in the homeland of Bophuthatswana, however, many
activists rejected the school as an inferior institution built to
keep medical training segregated.
   However, modern facilities and a qualified staff have helped the
university graduate 273 doctors who work in some of the country's
best hospitals as well as remote rural areas where health workers
are in severely short supply.
   ``The students reject the idea of segregated education, but we
accept that we are getting good training,'' said a 26-year-old
student asking to be identified only as Gwen.
   The school's new buildings and landscaped grounds sit behind a
barbed-wire fence 20 miles outside Pretoria, the capital. The
pristine campus appears out of place in dusty, run-down Ga-Rankuwa,
a sprawling collection of dirt roads and squatter shacks.
   Many of the prospective doctors come from similarly impoverished
communities. Some students arriving for the six-year program live
with electricity for the first time, and most have little or no
experience in laboratories.
   ``When students come here, they face tremendous adjustments,''
said the vice principal, Len Karlsson, who is white, as are all the
top administrators. ``The pace and the intensity of the program is
unlike anything they've experienced previously.''
   He said black public high schools do not adequately prepare
students for the rigors of medical school, and therefore the
university often selects older students with some practical medical
experience.
   About half the students are at least 25 years old and most have
worked in the health care field before enrolling, said Karlsson.
   The university offers remedial courses in most basic subjects,
but the failure rate remains high. About 40 percent of the 120
first-year students fail, although they are given the chance to
repeat.
   The university is expanding its entering class annually and is
one of the largest medical schools in Africa with about 1,500
students including its denistry, veterinary, nursing and
post-graduate programs.
   The school, referred to by the acronym MEDUNSA, produces half of
South Africa's 140 new black physicians each year. The rest come
from schools that are predominantly white, such as the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
   ``MEDUNSA is producing some outstanding doctors,'' said Dr.
Nthato Motlana, a prominent anti-apartheid activist who runs a
clinic in Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg.
   Motlana and other activists initially opposed MEDUNSA, calling
it a ``racist plan to build black medical school out in the bush.''
   Motlana still opposes segregated schools, but says MEDUNSA has
served to increase the meager supply of black doctors.
   Health services remain segregated, and the shortage of doctors
and facilities is acute in most black areas.
   Johannesburg's main white hospitals are about 50 percent empty,
while an average of more than 200 patients sleep on the floor each
night at Soweto's 2,700-bed Baragwanath Hospital, the only
full-service health facility for the township's 2.5 million
residents.
   Despite the overcrowding at black hospitals in urban areas, the
quality of care is much higher than in rural areas where the
doctors are far too few and the facilities often inadequate or
non-existent, Motlana said.
   MEDUNSA encourages graduates who want to work in rural areas,
but most students are from the cities and see no incentive to
relocate, school officials and students said.
   To combat the dearth of rural doctors, black homeland
governments provide scholarships for MEDUNSA students, who then are
required to return to work in the territories for several years
after graduation.
   ``Until its becomes attrative for doctors to practice in rural
areas most blacks will have trouble getting adequate health care,''
said Motlana. ``MEDUNSA has helped the situation, but it is not
enough by itself.''
   The university is financially supported by the South African
government, but students are required to pay a tuition the
equivalent of about $2,500 a year.
   Virturally every student receives some form of financial aid,
however.
   School officials say U.S. companies were generous with
scholarship money, but many of them have pulled out of South Africa
because of its apartheid policies and no longer donate funds.
   School officials didn't have exact figures on the reduction in
American assistance, but said its amounts to thousands of dollars
annually. Some U.S.-based firms still operating in South Africa,
including 3M, Colgate, and Johnson and Johnson, continue to provide
scholarship money.
