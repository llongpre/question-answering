   Jailed South African anti-apartheid leader Walter
Sisulu, his wife and seven children have been awarded the
Carter-Menil Human Rights Prize for their battle against the
country's system of racial separation.
   The award, created in 1986 to ``promote the protection of human
rights throughout the world,'' carries with it a $100,000 cash
prize.
   Sisulu, 76, has been in prison since 1964 when he was convicted
along with Nelson Mandela on sabotage charges. Mandela and Sisulu
were both founders of the outlawed African National Congress, and
Sisulu was twice elected secretary general of the organization.
   Walter's wife, Albertina, 63, is a co-president of the United
Democratic Front, a banned anti-apartheid coalition. The government
has imposed restrictions on her that limit her political activities
and bar her from making public statements. She works as a nurse.
   Five of the seven Sisulu children have been jailed or detained
at one time, with Zwelakhe Sisulu jailed since 1986 with no charge
filed against him.
   The younger Sisulu is editor of New Nation, a militantly
anti-apartheid weekly newspaper, and a former Nieman Fellow at
Harvard University.
   ``The continued existence of apartheid in South Africa is a blot
on the conscience of mankind,'' former President Jimmy Carter said.
The award is presented by the Carter-Menil Foundation, named for
Carter and Houston philanthropist Dominique de Menil.
   Mrs. de Menil joined Carter in making the announcement at
ceremonies Tuesday at the Carter Presidential Center.
   The Sisulus' ``leadership, fortitude and unwavering commitment
in fighting apartheid has given hope to all in South Africa who
oppose and suffer this unjust system,'' Carter said.
   Some of the children are in exile, and Carter said: ``All
members of the Sisulu family have endured extreme hardship,
including their painful separation by exile and detention. They
serve as a beacon of hope and a model of courage to all who oppose
apartheid.''
   ``By giving this award to the Sisulu family, we want to
demonstrate our solidarity with all those people both inside and
outside South Africa who are opposed to the system of apartheid,''
added Mrs. de Menil.
   The award will be presented at a Dec. 10 ceremony held on the
anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Carter said he expected some of the exiled family members
would be able to attend.
   Previous winners of the prize are Soviet physicist and dissident
Yuri Orlov; the Mutual Support of Guatemala, a group of family
members of those believed killed or kidnapped there; and La Vicaria
de la Solidaridad of Chile, which provides legal aid to political
prisoners and assists victims of human rights violations.
