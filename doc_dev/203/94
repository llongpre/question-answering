   Opposition leaders demanded
Tuesday that Defense Minister Magnus Malan be suspended and
directed to prove his allegation that an assassinated
anti-apartheid activist was an army spy.
   ``You have besmirched a hero,'' Denis Worrall, co-leader of the
Democratic Party, told Malan in Parliament. ``Not a single black
person in South Africa or Namibia believes you.''
   His party and the larger Conservative Party, which supports
apartheid, want Malan suspended until pending a judicial inquiry
into allegations that the Civil Cooperation Bureau, a secret
military intelligence unit, killed opponents of South Africa's
apartheid policy of race discrimination.
   Malan, defense minister since 1981, has denied ordering killings
or other criminal activity. More than 60 unsolved killings of
anti-apartheid activists have occurred in the past decade.
   South African and Namibian police are seeking three former
police officers who allegedly were recruited into a unit of the
military's Civil Cooperation Bureau.
   They have been missing since Namibian police issued warrants for
their arrest in the assassination in September 1989 of Anton
Lubowski, a lawyer who was the highest-ranking white member of the
South-West Africa People's Organization.
   SWAPO guerrillas fought a bush war against South African forces
in Namibia until April 1989. It won elections in November and will
control the government when the territory becomes independent in
March under U.N. supervision.
   On Monday, Malan declared in Parliament that Lubowski was ``a
paid agent of Military Intelligence'' who had done good work for
the army and there would have been no reason for the military
intelligence chief to have ordered action against him.
   Malan said he would make further comments only to the judicial
inquiry. Lubowski's family challenged him to repeat the allegation
outside the protection of parliamentary privilege.
   ``One of the reasons for this allegation is to create suspicion
of white SWAPO members,'' said Moses Garoeb, a SWAPO official. ``No
matter the extent of the smear campaign, the name of Anton Lubowski
will be remembered as a shining example of the struggle for
independence.''
   Worrall said in Parliament: ``Given the denial by the Lubowski
family and SWAPO, and the improbability of the suggestion that he
was a Military Intelligence agent, we are entitled to demand proof.
... If the man was paid, there must be bank acounts and evidence of
payments.''
   If Malan did not provide proof of his allegation, Worrall said,
he would ``simply be seen to be trying to save his own political
life.''
   The Star newspaper in Johannesburg, which has published several
articles showing the chain of command between Malan and the Civil
Cooperation Bureau, said Tuesday legal experts were shocked that
Malan had withheld evidence about Lubowski from police for five
months.
   Col. Jumbo Smit, the Namibian officer investigating the case,
said whether Lubowski worked for the South African army did not
matter to him. ``This is a murder case,'' he said, and the victim's
political affiliation or profession were not relevant.
   On Sunday, the Star said President F.W. de Klerk was ``expected
to fire'' Malan, whom it described as ``the last remnant of
ex-President P.W. Botha's securocrats.''
   It noted de Klerk had said in a television interview that
criminals, not the security forces, were under attack by those
making allegations about death squads. The Star said de Klerk's
comment appeared directed at statements by Malan that implied the
allegations were an attack on the Defense Force.
   The president, however, was one of several National Party
members of Parliament who shook Malan's hand after his statement
Monday.
   De Klerk has drastically reduced the army's power since he
replaced Botha in August. He has halved the period of compulsory
military service, cut the defense budget and ended military
management of black townships.
