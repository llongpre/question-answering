   President F.W. de Klerk
ordered a judicial inquiry Wednesday into the death of a
20-year-old black man found hanged in his prison cell.
   The man was arrested Friday along with four others accused in
the slayings of 10 people in guerrilla attacks over the past two
years. He reportedly was a former lover of jailed black leader
Nelson Mandela's daughter.
   Clayton Sithole was found hanging from a shower pipe Tuesday at
John Vorster Square, Johannesburg's central police station, police
said.
   Shortly after Sithole's death was announced, de Klerk ordered a
judicial inquiry, a step not taken after scores of previous
incidents in which black activists died while in police custody.
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok expressed condolences to
Sithole's family.
   According to local newspapers, Sithole was a former lover of
Zindzi Mandela and fathered one of her three children. There was no
immediate comment from the Mandelas, but associates of the family
said they believed the report was accurate.
   A family friend of the Mandelas, who requested anonymity, said
Sithole belonged to a controversial group of young men who served
as Winnie Mandela's bodyguards. Nine people associated with the
group have been in custody for months awaiting trial for the death
of a young black activist.
   Neither Vlok nor de Klerk indicated whether the decision to
launch an investigation was related to Sithole's reported
connection to the Mandela family. Mandela, 71, is widely expected
to be freed in the next few weeks after more than 27 years in
prison for his role in planning the guerrilla campaign of the
African National Congress. The organization is the main black group
fighting the white-led government.
   Denis Worrall, co-leader of the anti-apartheid Democratic Party,
welcomed de Klerk's swift response.
   ``It is surprising that President de Klerk would do this,''
Worrall said. ``I'm quite sure that a judicial commission of
inquiry would be justified.''
   Audrey Coleman, a prominent human rights activist, said
Sithole's family suspected the young man had been mistreated and
would obtain its own pathologist to conduct an independent post
mortem.
   Police said Sithole confessed to a magistrate before his death,
implicating himself in several killings. Police reportedly were
investigating whether Sithole and the other suspects were ANC
guerrillas.
   About 100 ANC guerrillas and anti-apartheid activists have died
in police custody in the past 25 years.
   According to police, suicide by hanging has been the most common
cause of these deaths, but human rights groups have insisted
interrogators mistreated many of these prisoners.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _ About 3,500 demonstrators in Cape Town peacefully marched on
police headquarters to present a petition condemning police actions
in a Jan. 23 protest, which was broken up by rubber bullets and
water cannon.
   _ In the central city of Bloemfontein, about 1,000 blacks
arrived by bus and van to protest against a boycott-breaking
English cricket team, which was in the second day of a three-day
match against a team of university players.
   _ Police said a policeman was among three people killed in
political violence in black townships around the port city of
Durban.
   _ About 4,500 blacks marched on municipal offices in the black
township of Daveyton, east of Johannesburg, smashing windows and
setting furniture afire, police said. The protest followed a rumor
that a child was killed when authorities dismantled squatter
shacks. Police said they had no evidence a child was killed.
