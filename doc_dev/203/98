   Police used whips and dogs to
disperse hundreds of blacks, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
during mass protests Saturday at two whites-only beaches.
   Tutu was carried shoulder-high onto the first beach targeted by
the demonstrators and later appealed to protesters at the other
beach to leave when he saw them being beaten with whips by police.
   ``We have proved these are God's beaches,'' he said.
   The Black Sash civil rights group said several protesters
sustained open wounds from the whips. The group said its monitors at
the second beach ``watched with horror'' as officers charged
families eating picnic lunches and used a helicopter to blow sand on
them.
   About 15 journalists covering the first protest, at The Strand
beach east of Cape Town, were detained for two hours.
   Nearer to the city, a black constable was killed by a group of
youths, police said.
   According to reports that local newspapers received from a human
rights lawyer, four black civilians also were injured and about 35
people arrested in clashes that broke out when protesters were
stopped from boarding buses to the beach. Those reports could not be
confirmed.
   Learning that The Strand had been sealed off with roadblocks,
several hundred blacks went to Bloubergstrand, a segregated beach
just north of Cape Town.
   Tutu, who had strolled along The Strand beach before he and
fellow demonstrators were dispersed, arrived at Bloubergstrand to
see police whipping protesters.
   Tutu climbed onto the back of a pick-up truck and successfully
persuaded the protesters to withdrew.
   John Allen, Tutu's press aide, said some white onlookers yelled
insults at the archbishop.
   Police also arrested at least 25 anti-apartheid demonstrators in
Durban and Johannesburg, and banned a major rally that had been
called for Sunday in Johannesburg to declare that outlawed
opposition groups were back in operation.
   Police Commissioner Hennie de Witt warned organizers of the
escalating nationwide campaign of defiance that ``lawlessness and
anarchy will not be tolerated.''
   Leaders of the campaign announced several days ago that blacks
would have a picnic Saturday on the segregated white beach at The
Strand.
   Late Friday, police and soldiers cordoned off a three-mile
stretch of whites-only beachfront and erected signs saying the beach
was closed because of a police dog-training exercise. Roadblocks
were erected, and some blacks arriving in buses to join the protest
were turned back.
   But Tutu and about 300 other protesters reached the beach area,
and the archbishop was carried onto the sand on the shoulders of
some of the crowd before they were dispersed by police equipped with
whips and guard dogs.
   Some of the group then went to a neighboring town, Gordon's Bay,
where Tutu, leader of South Africa's Anglican Church, held an
impromptu news conference.
   ``It is incredible that the government is prepared to use arms on
people who wish to have a picnic,'' he said. ``Instead of getting
rid of beach apartheid, they protect it with policemen, dogs and
guns.''
   The detained journalists, many of them representing U.S. and
British news organizations, were allowed to go free after film and
videotapes were confiscated. Police said the journalists had failed
to obey an order to leave the area.
   In the port city of Durban, 16 activists were arrested as they
stood outside a beachfront hotel protesting the presence of an
international all-star rugby team. The team's five-match tour to
South Africa has been approved by international rugby officials, but
militants have depicted the visit as a breach of the sports boycott
imposed to protest apartheid.
   Police said nine people were arrested in downtown Johannesburg
after scores of blacks chanted in the streets during a protest
against the arrest Friday of anti-apartheid activist Mohammed Valli
Moosa. Several demonstrators carried placards with the initials of
the United Democratic Front, which was banned last year.
   Organizers of the defiance campaign had planned several rallies
on Sunday to proclaim that the anti-apartheid coalition had
``unbanned'' itself. One rally has been banned and similar action
was expected against the others.
   The campaign began Aug. 3, when blacks sought treatment at white
hospitals, and has spread as the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections
approach. The state radio Saturday said police must ``respond
imaginatively'' in order to counter civil disobedience without
triggering violence.
