   Hundreds of thousands of blacks
went on strike today on the eve of segregated elections, and
Archbishop Desmond Tutu angrily accused police of desecrating his
church in breaking up rallies.
   Leading anti-apartheid groups and the country's two largest black
labor federations have endorsed the planned two-day strike, another
action in a nationwide defiance campaign protesting the exclusion of
blacks from Wednesday's parliamentary balloting.
   The campaign has included mass strolls by blacks on
``whites-only'' beaches and anti-government demonstrations by whites
and blacks that police have broken up with tear gas, water cannon
and batons.
   On Monday, police detained Tutu and fellow anti-apartheid
activist the Rev. Allan Boesak for 90 minutes after they refusing to
move away from a Cape Town church when police blocked its door with
an armored truck.
   ``They have gone berserk,'' Tutu said of police. ``I want to say
to the world that the terrorists in South Africa are the South
African government.''
   In the major cities of Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town today
it appeared students and trade union members were striking, but most
other black workers were on the job.
   Rush-hour traffic into cities was only slightly less heavy than
usual, according to several reports.
   The National Union of Mineworkers, the country's largest union,
said 78,000 members at 16 mines refused to go underground for their
morning shifts. Tens of thousands of miners were expected to join
the strike later in the day, the union said.
   Employers in heavily unionized industries said they expected the
strike, and most have adopted a ``no work, no pay, no punishment''
stance toward the workers.
   Across the country, black, mixed-race and Indian schools were
closed. Youths built burning-tire street barricades in the townships
outside Durban and in Soweto, the huge black city on the outskirts
of Johannesburg.
   Two bombs exploded overnight in mixed-race areas of Cape Town,
but there were no injuries and damage was minimal, police said.
   Activists tossed two hand grenades at a police station in Soweto,
and gasoline bombs at three homes belonging to black policemen near
Durban. No injuries were reported, police said.
   At the multi-racial University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg,
classes were canceled, but about 500 students and administrators
held an anti-election rally.
   ``There is something terribly wrong with those who rule us if
they cannot understand why such protest is occurring,'' said Colin
Webb, the white vice-principal of the university. ``Are they so deaf
that they cannot hear ... the frustratuion of South Africans who are
deprived of the privileges of citizenship?''
   In Wednesday's election, the National Party, which has ruled
South Africa for 41 years, is favored to keep control of the
dominant white chamber of Parliament. However, it is likely to lose
seats to both the far-right Conservative Party and the
anti-apartheid Democratic Party.
   Analysts predict the Nationalists will capture less than 50
percent of the white vote for the first time since 1953. However,
almost anything above 40 percent will allow them to win enough
individual districts to hold a majority in the white chamber.
   There also are polls for the Indian and mixed-race chambers.
Blacks, who make up 28 million of South Africa's 37 million people,
are excluded.
   Under the country's apartheid policies, the 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain segregated schools, neighborhoods
and hospitals.
   Acting President F.W. de Klerk said in campaign speech Monday
night that white domination must end, but in a way that does not
lead to whites being dominated.
   ``Discrimination must be eliminated. There is no other
alternative,'' he told a supportive National Party crowd of about
600 people in Johannesburg. But he said one-man, one-vote on a
common voters roll would mean black domination of whites.
   Shortly after de Klerk spoke, Cape Town police detained Tutu and
Boesak at when they refused to leave the Central Mission Methodist
Church, where people were trying to assembly for an anti-election
rally.
   Tutu said police also desecrated his church nearby, St. George's
Anglican Cathedral, when they entered it Monday evening. Police
ordered the church closed, barred people from coming in, and
temporarily kept the cathedral dean outside. He held a
reconsecration service this morning.
   ``The South African Police sank to new depths last night when
they desecrated my cathedral,'' said Tutu, head of the Anglican
Church in southern Africa. ``Everywhere in the world the church has
been recognized as a place of sanctuary, even by the craziest of
dictators.''
