   Mitsubishi Estate Co., a major Japanese real
estate concern, announced Monday it will buy 51 percent of
Rockefeller Group Inc., the private real estate and entertainment
company controlled by descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr.
   The $846 million cash purchase will give Mitsubishi majority
control of Radio City Music Hall Productions Inc., the Cushman &amp;
Wakefield Inc. real estate firm and Rockefeller Center, the
landmark, 22-acre Manhattan development built by Rockefeller.
   Last month, Rockefeller Group confirmed media reports that it
was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company. The
reports indicated that some Rockefeller family members, who control
the company through trusts, wanted more income from their
investments. Most of the family members' inheritance is tied up in
real estate and other corporate holdings.
   But the independent trust committee that manages the family's
trusts said the money from the sale to Mitsubishi would be
reinvested in other company operations. William G. Bowen, chairman
of the trust committee, said one objective of the sale was to
diversify the company's holdings, which are concentrated in real
estate.
   ``Our agreement with Mitsubishi Estate preserves the abiding
commitment to Rockefeller Center and New York City, which my father
made more than 50 years ago, and which present generations of the
family continue to feel,'' David Rockefeller, Rockefeller Group's
chairman, said in a statement.
   Richard A. Voell, Rockefeller Group's president and chief
executive, said the purchase of the 627,000 shares in the company
by Mitsubishi ``ensures the company's ability to continue to invest
in Rockefeller Center to enhance its stature as the most modern and
prestigious commercial complex.''
   He said Rockefeller Group's board, its advisers and the trust
committee considered other options, such as a recapitalization
funded by debt, before they decided on the sale.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space,
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real
estate investment trust. The company also manages Rockefeller
Center.
   The Rockefeller family fortune was built by John D. Rockefeller,
founder of Standard Oil Co., and was estimated at $900 million by
1911.
   His son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created five trusts for his
children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal owners of
Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr. the
main beneficiaries.
   The Rockefeller Center complex includes the General Electric
Building, formerly known as the RCA building, Radio City Music Hall
and the Time-Life building.
   Rockefeller Group's other businesses include: Rockefeller Center
Development Corp., Rockefeller Center Management Corp., Rockefeller
Group Telecommunications Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc., and Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in which the company
holds an 80 percent stake.
   Mitsubishi Estate is one of Japan's largest real estate
companies. Its other major U.S. investments include partnerships
that built a $500 million office building at Citicorp Plaza in Los
Angeles and a 2,300-acre resort complex at Palm Desert, Calif.
