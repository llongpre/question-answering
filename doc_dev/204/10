   When he announced his family's plans to sell
Rockefeller Center, David Rockefeller said the deal ``preserves the
abiding commitment'' to New York City his father made 50 years ago,
``and which generations of the family continue to feel.''
   But the sale to one of Japan's largest real estate companies
underscored a change in the relationship between the Rockefellers
and New York, and offered a reminder that the city will have to
face the next century with relatively little assistance from a
family that helped it through this one.
   New York has had many rich and powerful families such as the
deLanceys, the Astors and the Vanderbilts, but none shaped the city
like the Rockefellers.
   The family's accumulated works range from the stone towers of
the Cloisters, a museum in the shape of a monastery in northern
Manhattan, to the gleaming steel ones of the World Trade Center
downtown.
   In between there is Lincoln Center, the Museum of Modern Art,
the Museum of the City of New York, Rockefeller University,
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Asia Society, Chase
Manhattan Plaza.
   ``Where else,'' asks historian Henry Hope Reed, ``can we find so
large a contribution by one family, and a contribution so diverse?''
   Not Japan, apparently. Last weekend, at a conference on
philanthropy at the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills, Japanese
experts explained that the Japanese do not have the philanthropic
tradition that the Rockefellers epitomize; they traditionally look
to government for such services.
   Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co. said Monday it would pay $846
million to buy a 51 percent stake in Rockefeller Group Inc.
Rockefeller Group's most famous asset is the 22-acre Rockefeller
Center in midtown Manhattan, with its skating rink, annual
Christmas tree, Radio City Music Hall and office buildings. The
Associated Press Building, the news service's world headquarters,
is located in the center.
   News of the purchase was accompanied by assurances the center
will be maintained with the attention for which the Rockefellers
are renowned.
   But New York knows what a difference an individual can make in
the life of a city, because of the examples of John D. Rockefeller
Jr., the man who built Rockefeller Center during the Depression.
   He began life as the son of the nation's richest man, who was
notorious for ruthlessly eliminating competition to monopolize the
U.S. oil-refining industry at the turn of the century.
   As Peter Collier and David Horowitz note in their book, ``The
Rockefellers,'' the son created a philanthropic empire as
impressive as the father's business one. For Junior, ``giving was a
profession, a vocation,'' in which he helped his father spend $500
million and then gave away another $500 million himself.
   Although his gifts were widespread _ he preserved thousands of
acres of Western wilderness and restored colonial Williamsburg, Va.
_ New York City was his focus.
   ``The city was his passion, making it a better place,'' said
Paul Gunther of the Municipal Art Society. ``The physical evidence
is everywhere. Those things would not have been built without him.''
   He built the Cloisters and the Riverside Church, a re-creation
of a French Gothic cathedral. He contributed $1 million to Union
Theological Seminary and built International House for foreign
students.
   In December 1946, hours before the United Nations was set to
establish its headquarters outside New York City, Rockefeller
agreed to pay $8.5 million for a site on the East River, which he
gave to the world body.
   ``Why, Pa, that's most generous!'' his son Nelson, later to
become governor of New York and then vice president, told him.
   Rockefeller's children followed his lead, playing dominant or
vital roles in the creation of Lincoln Center, the World Trade
Center and numerous other projects.
   Today, there still is a vast Rockefeller commitment to
philanthropy. But John D. Jr.'s two surviving sons are in their
70s, and three years ago Fortune magazine concluded that the family
``is retreating from a tradition of massive giving.''
   The family's fourth generation, the 22 men and women who call
themselves the Cousins, range in age from 22 to 61. By some
accounts they give away as much as $40 million a year. But the
original family of eight that lived under one roof has multiplied
and scattered across the nation, and their charitable concerns
have, too.
   Few of the cousins live in New York now, and the city is not a
primary focus of their philanthropy, said Gunther.
   The city also has changed. ``It was a lot easier to assemble
land and get things built in (John D. Jr.'s) days,'' said George
Taylor Jr., a family spokesman.
