   Mitsubishi Estate Co., the company buying a
majority stake in the owner of Manhattan's famed Rockefeller
Center, is not a Sony, or anything like it.
   Sony Corp., the consumer electronics manufacturer that is buying
Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion, is seen in Japan as a brash,
innovative upstart.
   Mitsubishi Estate is an aristocratic collector of rents that
belongs to the Mitsubishi group, considered a grand, rather gray
old lady among Japanese business circles.
   The company's planned $846 million investment in the symbolic
heart of Manhattan was characterized by analysts on Tuesday as an
attempt to branch out from Mitsubishi's conservative base.
   Although the company's profitability is high, it trails other
Japanese property firms in overseas investment and overall growth.
   For its New York foray, Mitsubishi sought an equally prestigious
partner. As brand names are important to the Japanese tourists
mobbing the boutiques at Rockefeller Center, the same holds for
companies like Mitsubishi.
   ``They were looking for a top-tier name,'' Tadashi Kato, an
analyst at Prudential Bache Securities, said.
   Japanese stock market investors don't know much about
privately-held Rockefeller Group except the name, but Mitsubishi
stock closed up 150 points at 2,680 yen Tuesday on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange after the deal was announced.
   The Mitsubishi name rings of 19th-century oligarchs, wartime
tycoons and the postwar government-business establishment.
   Mitsubishi managers are known as quintessential organization men
in a country of organization men. Its blue-suited employees
traditionally have been considered the cream of the elite, the kind
of solid, well-heeled men people want their daughters to marry _ a
far cry from some of the Japanese real estate wheeler-dealers
famous in the United States but infamous at home.
   The Rockefeller and Mitsubishi empires began as products of the
same era, the robber-baron days of the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Yataro Iwasaki started the Mitsubishi fortune in
shipbuilding, John D. Rockefeller in oil. With Japan's wartime
expansion, Mitsubishi grew into one of Japan's leading
``zaibatsu,'' or business combines.
   Both empires fell victim to trust-busting. Mitsubishi's
209-company combine was broken up and family influence virtually
eliminated in the postwar dissolution of the zaibatsu by the
occupying Americans.
   Mitsubishi group no longer is controlled by a single holding
company, but its 41 companies maintain relations through a system
of cross-shareholding known as ``keiretsu.'' Companies operate
independently and often compete against each other, but in times of
need all know they can depend on Mitsubishi Bank for help.
Mitsubishi Trust owns 7.3 percent of Mitsubishi Estate, and
Mitsubishi Bank owns 4.1 percent.
   Group companies produce everything from gasoline to chemicals,
steel, automobiles, paper, electronic equipment, weapons and
aircraft, with a trading company buying and selling worldwide.
   Mitsubishi Estate ``is seen as a gentlemanly company in a
business that in Japan is seen as ungentlemanly,'' says James
Doherty, analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities.
   The company owns much of Tokyo's equivalent of Rockefeller
Center and midtown Manhattan _ the prestigious Marunouchi business
district next to the Imperial Palace, a stone's throw from the
glittering Ginza.
   Sitting on the most valuable contiguous piece of real estate in
the world, Mitsubishi collects rents at less than half market value
and still is the most profitable real estate company in Japan,
analysts say.
   Mitsubishi says it has the largest portfolio of office buildings
in Japan, 25 million square feet with a book value of more than $5
billion. Jardine Fleming estimated the real value at well over $70
billion at the beginning of 1988.
   But the long history of its Marunouchi property, which
Mitsubishi originally recovered from swampland on imperial orders
in the 19th century, is part of its problem.
   ``It's like it's this big diamond just sitting there,'' says
Alan Woodhull, analyst at Merrill Lynch.
   City regulations forbid Mitsubishi from tearing down existing
mid-rise buildings in Marunouchi for more efficient high-rises. The
company can't raise rents of long-term tenants to market levels in
part because of legal restrictions, in part because some of those
tenants are Mitsubishi group companies.
   Mitsubishi still hopes to get permission to redevelop
Marunouchi. Meanwhile, it has started a huge reclaimed land project
in Tokyo Bay off Yokohama, where it is building Japan's tallest
skyscraper.
   Overseas, it plans to expand business that has lagged far behind
other Japanese companies. Mitsubishi has invested only 5 percent of
its assets outside Japan, the company says.
   Mitsubishi's overseas holdings include the 777 Tower building in
Los Angeles' Citicorp Plaza and a 1,000-acre Sunrise resort project
in Palm Desert, Calif.
   Analysts say Mitsubishi is likely to take a hands-off approach
to its 51 percent share in the Rockefeller Group, which includes
the management of the Rockefeller Center Development Corp., the
Cushman and Wakefield real estate firm and Radio City Music Hall
Productions.
   ``A company like Mitsubishi doesn't mind low yields. If they
don't get a quick return, that wouldn't faze them at all,'' said
Doherty.
