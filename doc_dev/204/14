<TEXT>
<P>
Yataro Iwasaki was a man with an eye for real estate. In 1890, the founder of 
the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu -- a large industrial combine that later spawned a 
loose family of 41 companies with combined annual revenue approaching $200 
billion -- bought a tract of swampy land adjacent to the Imperial Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Iwasaki's little corner of Tokyo is potentially the most valuable turf 
in the world. It lies beneath the concrete bedrock of the premier business 
districts of Marunouchi and Otemachi. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a century after the entrepreneur bought his 87 acres from the central 
government, most of the land is still in the hands of his corporate heirs and 
its value has skyrocketed so high during the postwar real estate boom that 
nobody seems to know exactly how much it is worth. The book value is $5 
billion, but analysts say that figure is so low that it is meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Now the foremost landlord to Japan Inc. is about to become America's most 
conspicuous property owner. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate Co., formed out of the real estate division of Iwasaki's 
Mitsubishi conglomerate in 1937, announced in Tokyo and New York on Monday that 
it plans to acquire a 51% stake in the Rockefeller Group, the real estate 
investment arm of the Rockefeller family trusts. 
</P>
<P>
The $846-million investment would give Mitsubishi Estate at least nominal 
controlling interest in Rockefeller Center, which includes Depression-era Art 
Deco landmarks in Midtown Manhattan such as Radio City Music Hall and the RCA 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi's financial gambit may stir up unpleasant emotions in those who are 
concerned about the flood of Japanese and other foreign investments in the 
United States, but these critics might have a hard time arguing that the 
Mitsubishi-Rockefeller deal represents any kind of clash of cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
In a curious way, Iwasaki and his Mitsubishi men have a lot in common with John 
D. Rockefeller, founder of the Standard Oil trust, and the scions of his 
all-American zaibatsu. 
</P>
<P>
So apparent was this affinity that Raymond F. Pettit, senior vice president and 
chief financial officer for the Rockefeller Group, told reporters in Tokyo that 
Mitsubishi was chosen over nine other Japanese and foreign suitors because of a 
certain "chemistry" at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
In Mitsubishi Estate, the stewards of the Rockefeller legacy saw the kind of 
stolid and conservative investor that would make a long-term commitment to "the 
quality, the traditions and the values associated with the Rockefeller family," 
William G. Bowen, chairman of the Rockefeller Trust Committee, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Iwasaki, like the original Rockefeller, had a relatively humble start -- for a 
samurai. The son of a minor feudal clan on the island of Shikoku, he struck out 
in business in 1870 with a shipping and mail courier service plying the coastal 
waters between Tokyo and Osaka. He would later win government concessions for 
mail routes to the United States and China, and would merge with his bitter 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
Japan in the late 19th Century had only recently emerged from nearly three 
centuries of feudal isolation and was engaged in an intense national effort to 
build military might and catch up with the industrialized West. A handful of 
capitalists such as Iwasaki played major roles in their country's rapid 
development by taking over state-owned industries and forming huge industrial 
and financial conglomerates, the zaibatsu. 
</P>
<P>
By 1890, the year Iwasaki made his farsighted real estate purchase in Tokyo, 
Mitsubishi had diversified into finance, mining, shipbuilding and heavy 
machinery. The company grew into one of three major zaibatsu, along with Mitsui 
and Sumitomo, and was tightly held by the Iwasaki clan until the 1920s, when 
public shares were first issued. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would later build the Zero fighter 
planes that tormented U.S. fleets in the Pacific during World War II and would 
launch the world's largest battleship, the Musashi. Like the rest of corporate 
Japan, Mitsubishi was an integral part of the war machine. 
</P>
<P>
"We must perform our duty with a clear-cut resolve to serve, above all things, 
the interests of the state," Koyota Iwasaki, a descendant of the founder who 
became president of the trust company controlling the zaibatsu, told a 
gathering of top Mitsubishi executives two days after the Dec. 7, 1941, attack 
on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Where the stories of the Iwasakis and their fellow zaibatsu families differ 
from those of the Rockefellers or the Carnegies is that it took three or four 
decades for the concept of anti-monopolistic regulation to reach the Japanese 
islands, and only then at the insistence of postwar U.S. occupation 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court broke up Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co. in 1911. The 
American-inspired dissolution of the Japanese monopolies after the war was only 
half completed, however, when they were allowed to reassemble as loosely 
structured industrial groups, now known as keiretsu. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi's case is typical of how the zaibatsu have survived. Gone are family 
control and the trust company that was once at the top of the pyramid. But 
Mitsubishi Corp., the general trading subsidiary, reassembled itself 
immediately after the American occupation ended in 1947 and now "coordinates" 
the activities of the group. The heads of the 41 companies in the group meet 
monthly to map out strategies in what is euphemistically called a presidents' 
club. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also reunited after a breakup to reestablish itself 
as Japan's leading defense contractor. Most notably, it is the company that 
will take the lead in developing the fighter jet of the next generation, the 
FSX, subject of much controversy earlier this year. American critics nearly 
scuttled a U.S.-Japan development program, warning that Mitsubishi Heavy would 
use U.S. military technology to gain international dominance in the commercial 
aerospace industry (a charge that Mitsubishi denied). 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate, like the other companies in the group, is operated 
independently yet remains 20.9% owned by Mitsubishi Group affiliates -- 
demonstrating the classic pattern of cross-shareholdings and interlocking 
directorates that U.S. officials say can generate the kind of clannish business 
relationships that become "structural impediments" to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi companies have not been singled out in ongoing trade negotiations, 
but serious question might be raised as to whether an American company could 
ever make an investment in Japan comparable to Mitsubishi Estate's proposed 
stake in the Rockefeller Group. As such, the deal is likely to match Sony 
Corp.'s $3.4-billion bid for Columbia Pictures as a symbol of imbalance in 
economic relations between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockefeller venture will not be Mitsubishi Estate's first move into the 
U.S. market, but it is its most obvious. The company developed a 102-acre 
residential tract in Jupiter, Fla., 16 years ago, but now refuses to disclose 
financial details. It joined partnerships constructing an office building in 
Portland, Ore., in the early 1980s, and is involved in a 1,000-acre resort 
project in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The company's only major undertaking to date has been its investment, with two 
other partners, in the 777 Tower building at Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles, a 
$500-million project that will have 3 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Back home, Mitsubishi Estate has a reputation among industry analysts as a 
conservative and cumbersome giant that has missed many opportunities in 
overseas real estate while its rivals were acting more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The security represented by the company's holdings in the Marunouchi and 
Otemachi districts, where it owns 32 major buildings and still has title to 
about 50 acres, perhaps accounts for the complacency. Add 39 office buildings 
in other parts of Tokyo and elsewhere in Japan, for a total of 25 million 
square feet of office space, and Mitsubishi stands out as Japan's largest 
commercial landlord. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, rental income makes it by far the country's most profitable real estate 
concern. It takes in about $269 million a year in after-tax profit on more than 
$2 billion in gross revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also beginning to assert itself with high-profile development 
projects, such as the 75-story Landmark Tower it plans to start building soon 
at the Minato Mirai complex in Yokohama. It will be Japan's tallest building. 
</P>
<P>
Yet real estate analysts say the company faces some tough bureaucratic 
wrangling before it can capitalize on its so-called latent assets in the 
Marunouchi and Otemachi business districts. Mitsubishi has been unable to 
persuade Tokyo metropolitan authorities to revise density limits for the area, 
so the eight- to 10-story office blocks now lining the streets may represent 
the maximum development for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the city, meanwhile, may move west to the urban hub of Shinjuku, 
where a cluster of skyscrapers stands and city authorities envision erecting a 
new financial district on landfill islands in Tokyo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Iwasaki's 99-year-old investment in Tokyo real estate is hardly losing 
value. Results of recent surveys suggest that the cost of commercial land is 
leveling off, but not even the most pessimistic analyst predicts a crash. At 
last reckoning earlier this year, the National Land Agency calculated the 
market price of land in the Marunouchi district as holding firm at more than 
$22,000 a square foot, a rate that might make the Empire State Building seem 
cheap -- if it were for sale.

Through its acquisition of 51% of Rockefeller Group stock, Mitsubishi Estate 
Co. will assume a 14.5% controlling interest in New York City's Rockefeller 
Center. Most of the buildings within the 22-acre complex are involved in the 
deal.
