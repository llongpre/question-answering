   The Supreme Court has agreed to resolve a
dispute that could put at risk the federal protection for the
pensions of 30 million U.S. workers.
   The justices said Monday they will decide what authority the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal agency, has to order
employers to revive scraped pension plans.
   A federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside
the agency's order that LTV Corp. and a subsidiary, LTV Steel Co.,
restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of $2.3
billion.

   In yet another Japanese takeover of an American
institution, Mitsubishi Estate Co. plans to pay $846 million for
control of the company that owns Rockefeller Center and Radio City
Music Hall.
   The announcement late Monday by Mitsubishi, one of Japan's
largest real estate companies, follows last month's takeover of
Columbia Pictures by Sony Corp. for $3.4 billion.
   Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns and manages the 19-building
Rockefeller Center office complex in Manhattan, is a legacy of a
family whose name stands for American capitalism. The family, which
controls the private company, traces its fortune to John D.
Rockefeller, who founded the Standard Oil trust.

   The White House shot down a suggestion by
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole that the federal gasoline tax be
increased to build new roads and bridges, leaving the idea
politically lifeless.
   Fitzwater's remarks Monday all but guarantee that unless
President Bush changes his mind, there will be no increase to the
9.1-cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax.
   The Democratic leaders of Congress, sensitive to the
unpopularity of tax increases, have been saying for months that
they will not seek to raise taxes without Bush's approval in
advance.

   United Airlines pilots resumed contract talks
with UAL Corp. and said the concessions they agreed to as part of a
failed employee buyout will go out the window if no agreement is
reached before Thanksgiving.
   Those concessions include flying United's 747-400 aircraft on
daily round-trip flights from Los Angeles to Sydney and Melbourne,
Australia. The pilots agreed to fly the planes beginning Sept. 18,
ending a dispute over the size of the cockpit crew that had kept
the planes grounded since June.
   Contract talks resumed Monday.

   Two more Wall Street brokerages said they would
limit their program trading, joining other major firms that have
backed away from the strategy under pressure following the recent
stock market volatility.

would not execute index arbitrage for its clients. Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co. said it had ceased index arbitrage for its own accounts but
would continue using the strategy for its customers.
   The announcements followed similar moves by large brokerages
last week.

   The House Banking Committee chairman has told
President Bush that thrift regulator M. Danny Wall should step
aside, prompting charges from Wall's defenders that the panel is
trying to make the regulator a scapegoat.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, told Bush that his committee,
in its investigation of the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association of Irvine, Calif., has heard ``startling evidence''
that Wall blocked efforts by field examiners to collect evidence of
misconduct by Lincoln officials.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
he doesn't want the power over airline takeovers that a bill
pending in Congress would give him.
   The House planned today to take up the Air Carrier Securities
Act, which would require the Transportation Department to block
purchase of 15 percent or more of an airline if the sale threatened
to hinder safety, reduce competition, break up the carrier or put
it under foreign control.
   Skinner made the comment Monday in an interview.

   The company also said Monday it is having ``substantial'' losses
on some government and defense programs. Boeing released its
earnings statement as its negotiators met with those of the
Machinists union in an attempt to end the four-week-old strike.

on a football field over rival ``taste great'' and ``less filling''
claims for Miller Lite beer.
