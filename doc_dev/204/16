   Nearly half of the lake acreage in 34 states
is badly polluted or likely soon to become that way, the
Environmental Protection Agency said today.
   The EPA's latest survey of lake water quality shows that serious
pollution problems have impaired about one-fourth of more than 12
million acres of lakes examined in those states. Pollution
threatens similar impairment in another 20 percent of the lake
acres.
   While the causes for the lake pollution varied, three-fourths of
the pollution was attributed to agricultural and urban runoffs.
Another 11 percent was blamed on industrial or sewage releases and
the remainder to natural causes.
   Meanwhile, the EPA was named in a lawsuit Monday charging that
the agency has failed to develop national standards for toxic
pollution of public waterways.

   The Bush administration is exploring with the
Soviet Union a possible early superpower summit to discuss ways the
United States might help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev revamp his
country's faltering economy, U.S. officials say.
   The Washington Post in today's editions said a meeting between
President Bush and Gorbachev might be held as early as December at
a neutral site, perhaps on a ship in the Mediterranean.
   Two U.S. officials confirmed tentative discussions were under
way with Moscow, but declined to discuss the substance of the Post
report. ``It's on the right track,'' said one official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The planning is evidently being conducted in exceptional
secrecy. Other usually knowledgeable officials said they were
unaware of a possible early summit between Bush and Gorbachev.

   Hundreds of thousands of people in a half dozen
East German cities took to the streets to demand democratic change
on the eve of a trip by Egon Krenz to Moscow, his first foreign
journey as the country's leader.
   Krenz, who rose to power nearly two weeks ago amid a rising din
of demands for a more open society, was expected to hold talks with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on his government's approach to reform.
   Aktuelle Kamera, East Germany's main evening news program, said
about 300,000 people rallied Monday night in Leipzig, a city of
about 650,000, in what now seems a weekly ritual.
   Activists said many marchers demanded that the Communist Party
relinquish its monopoly on power. Witnesses also said the
protesters carried signs demanding free elections and the
legalization of opposition groups.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says
threats by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to suspend a truce
with the Contra rebels may be a prelude to Sandinista cancellation
of national elections set for February.
   ``I worry that they (the Sandinistas) may be trying to lay a
predicate to walk away from their commitment to hold elections,''
Baker said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press.
   However, Ortega insisted Monday the elections will be held.
   ``The elections are taking place in Nicaragua, period,'' Ortega
said, speaking through an interpreter in an interview with NBC
News. ``With Contra or without Contra they are going to take place,
definitely. With war or no war, that is, elections are taking
place.''

   Navy officials are questioning the pilot of a
fighter jet that dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile
cruiser USS Reeves, blowing a gaping hole in the ship's bow and
injuring five sailors.
   The incident, which occurred while the cruiser was escorting the
aircraft carrier USS Midway on training operations in the Indian
Ocean, was the Navy's second major training accident in as many
days.
   On Sunday, a student pilot slammed a T-2 Buckeye into the
carrier USS Lexington, killing himself and four members of the deck
crew during training exercises off Florida.
   Navy spokesmen said the pilot of the single-seat F-A-18 Hornet
had just taken off from the Midway.

   The Bay cities capped World Series mania
with muted celebration and returned to the business of recovery
from billions of dollars in earthquake damage as lawmakers prepared
to debate how to pay the bill.
   The scale of the disaster continued to become more apparent as
the number of applicants for emergency housing, grants and loans
reached 30,000, but a poll indicated most Californians would
support a sales tax hike to help out.
   Businesses, meanwhile, began ad campaigns to bring back tourists
and conventions to prevent economic disaster on top of the natural
calamity.
   About 4,000 fans cheered the Oakland Athletics in Oakland's Jack
London Square on Monday, but there was no parade and the Oct. 17
quake that delayed the A's victory over the San Francisco Giants
for 10 days was in mind.

   In yet another Japanese takeover of an American
institution, Mitsubishi Estate Co. plans to pay $846 million for
control of the company that owns the landmark Rockefeller Center
and Radio City Music Hall.
   The announcement late Monday by Mitsubishi, one of Japan's
largest real estate companies, follows last month's announced
takeover of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. by Japan's Sony
Corp. for $3.4 billion. It also continues a trend of major Japanese
real estate purchases in the United States.
   Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns and manages the 19-building
Rockefeller Center complex in midtown Manhattan, is a legacy of a
family whose name stands for American capitalism.
   The family, which controls the private company, traces its
fortune to John D. Rockefeller, who founded the Standard Oil trust.
