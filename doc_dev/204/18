FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Rockefeller denies reports of
mortgage default on centre

Rockefeller Group, which owns the Rockefeller Centre office complex in
Manhattan, yesterday denied reports that it could soon default on its
mortgage payments on the centre.
Rockefeller Group is 80 per cent controlled by Mitsubishi Estate of Japan
while the other 20 per cent of Rockefeller Group is in the hands of the
Rockefeller family.
In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
holder of the Dollars 1.3bn mortgage on the complex - the real estate
investment trust Rockefeller Centre Properties (RCP) - warned there was
'substantial concern' about the ability of Rockefeller Group to meet its
mortgage payments. Due to the depressed state of the New York commercial
property market, Rockefeller Centre's rental income has not been able to
cover its mortgage payments for years.
Yesterday the Rockefeller Group said the next monthly Dollars 46.5m interest
payment on the mortgage had been paid, and it remained committed to
'maintaining the Rockefeller Centre as the premier commercial property in
the world'.
Although Mitsubishi and the Rockefeller family have made up the Dollars 300m
annual cash shortfall on the Rockefeller Centre's books for the past five
years, the SEC filing raised doubts about Mitsubishi's willingness to
continue covering the large losses.
If Mitsubishi pulled out of its commitment to cover the losses and the
property defaulted, ownership of the centre would revert to RCP as the
mortgage holder.
Although property analysts have long doubted whether Mitsubishi would cut
its losses because of the damage such a move would inflict on its
reputation, the SEC filing indicated that RCP believed the Japanese group
may be close to changing its mind.
When Mitsubishi bought majority control of the landmark art-deco complex for
Dollars 1.4bn in 1989, it was one of the most high-profile Japanese
investments in the US. Soon after that deal the New York property market
collapsed and the 19-building complex is estimated to be worth less than
Dollars 1bn.
