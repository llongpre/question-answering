<P>
O. Stillman Rockefeller, 30-year-old heir to the Rockefeller and Carnegie 
fortunes, today was flown back to New York City for treatment of shark bites he 
suffered off a Fiji island owned by the estate of the late publisher Malcolm 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
The son of former banker James S. Rockefeller and his wife, the former Nancy 
Carnegie of the steel family, returned to the United States accompanied by a 
medical team, according to a spokesman for Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
He was being treated at a New York area hospital. His condition was not 
immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller was guest on Forbes-owned Laucala Island resort when the shark 
attack occurred Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller, one of America's most eligible bachelors, belongs to the 
Greenwich, Conn., branch of the Rockefeller family established by William 
Rockefeller, brother of the original John D. Rockefeller of oil empire fame. 
</P>
<P>
He is a second cousin of Michael Rockefeller, son of late Vice President Nelson 
A. Rockefeller, who disappeared in Papua New Guinea in 1961. His fate remains a 
mystery but it was widely believed at the time that he was eaten by crocodiles.
