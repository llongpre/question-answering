   Some heirs to great family fortunes dabble in
art collecting. Others become renowned philanthropists.
   Ola Stillman Rockefeller is posing for underwear ads.
   Rockefeller, 30, is the newest pitchman for Jockey International
Inc. The company unveiled the magazine ad campaign at a news
conference Tuesday with the aid of baseball great Jim Palmer, who
is perhaps the best-known Jockey model.
   Rockefeller, according to material provided by his public
relations agency, has a ``recent penchant for art.'' He has
collaborated on collages with Mark Kostabi, a New York artist who
has mounted public relations stunts to promote his artworks.
   Rockefeller said Jockey came to him with the idea of posing for
the ads.
   ``I kind of hemmed and hawed,'' he said in an interview. ``I
really wanted to do it but then I thought, `Is my grandfather going
to kill me or cut me off or something?' But I eventually decided to
do it. I'm just sort of winging it.''
   He said his grandfather, James Stillman Rockefeller, former
chairman of First National City Bank of New York, opposed the plan
until the younger Rockefeller said he would give the proceeds to
Memorial-Sloan Kettering Hospital, a family charity.
   ``In some ways I am trying to create my own identity,''
Rockefeller said. ``Sometimes it's hard if you're the son of or
descendant of _ you're expected to play a certain role.''
   Rockefeller said he hopes the exposure he gains through the ads
_ in which he is tastefully garbed in plaid undershorts and a
T-shirt _ will help further his art aspirations.
   Rockefeller, whose great grandfather was a brother to John D.
Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil Co., said he's been
wearing Jockey underwear since he was 14.
   One of Rockefeller's cousins, James Stillman Rockefeller Rose,
said Rockefeller's plan to pose for the ad ``sort of came out
suddenly.''
   ``The only reason the family let him get away with it is that
he's donating the procedes to Sloan-Kettering,'' Rose said in a
telephone interview.
   Several years ago, Rockefeller announced he would launch a line
of men's clothing featuring the family crest. The clothes never
materialized, ``thank God,'' Rose said, adding that the family was
dismayed by the intended use of the crest.
   Rose, 30, described his cousin as the non-traditional member of
an otherwise low-key family.
   Rose, who helps manage a family-run investment company, said
that despite the trust funds _ the total of which dwindles with
each generation _ most members of his generation of the
Rockefellers are employed.
   ``We've have a much stronger work ethic than a lot of our
cousins on the other side of the family do, out of necessity and
training,'' he said.
