   The Rockefellers have sold control of the
Manhattan landmark bearing their name to a Japanese firm, and
several grandchildren of Campbell Soup Co.'s founder want that
company auctioned to strangers.
   You might ask how they can they sell the family businesses _
especially those with famous names. As time goes on, it becomes
easy.
   Emotional ties to a family-owned firm, hatched from scratch and
sweat by entrepreneurial ancestors, can weaken with each passing
generation until the company's asset value outweighs its
sentimental value and the corporation becomes an albatross to its
owners.
   For $846 million, the Rockefellers turned over a controlling
interest in Rockefeller Group Inc. to Mitsubishi Estate Co. In
relinquishing control, the Rockefellers parted with New York's
Rockefeller Center, the most visible and tangible symbol of their
family fortune, and also surrendered exclusive rights to the
Rockefeller name.
   Meanwhile, three grandchildren of Campbell founder John T.
Dorrance Sr. have split with other relatives and want the company
sold. The dissident Dorrances, while their names aren't emblazoned
on soup cans, also are willing to sever their connection with a
brand name familiar to millions worldwide.
   In some ways, the Rockefellers and Dorrances are like many other
heirs of successful business entrpreneurs. Having grown away from
the family company, they want to take their inheritance and move on.
   David Rockefeller Jr. is the great-great grandson of John D.
Rockefeller and the great-grandson of John D. Jr., the founder of
Rockefeller Center. He said recently that his generation has its
own priorities.
   ``I don't know how far the family, as individuals, would have
wanted to go if they had been asked to pump capital funds into
keeping up these buildings, compared to supporting charitable
causes or pursuing their own careers,'' Rockefeller said in an
interview in the magazine Manhattan Inc.
   ``Frankly, I'm not so sure that if it came down to that, that
they would have said, `The way we want to spend our money is to
buff up the marble down at the Center,'' Rockefeller was quoted as
saying. He refused to be interviewed for this story.
   It's nothing new for the descendants of a company founder to
sell off the family business and its well-known name _ the Fields
of Chicago did it twice.
   Marshall Field III, grandson of retailer Marshall Field, sold
the family's famous department store in 1941, and turned instead
toward journalism, building the Field Enterprises Inc. media empire.
   But more than 40 years later, in 1983, Marshall III's own
grandsons, Marshall Field V and Frederick Field, dissolved the
second family company after a dispute and went separate ways.
   Marshall Field V's current holdings include Field Corp., which
owns Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc. and other publishers. Frederick Field is
among the investors in the group that bid recently for BAT
Industries PLC, the British conglomerate with properties that
ironically include Marshall Field.
   On the other hand, the Philadelphia-based department store
company Strawbridge &amp; Clothier, founded in 1868, is still
controlled by the Strawbridge and Clothier clans. Just about all
other big department stores across the country have long since been
sold off by their founding families.
   Strawbridge &amp; Clothier also has dealt with dissident relatives
who wanted out. In 1984 a group of Strawbridges decided to sell
their 17 percent stake. The company, facing a takeover, bought the
shares to retain family control.
   Even in some of the biggest corporations, founding family
descendants are active. Nearly 190 years after DuPont Co. was
created, members of the DuPont family still have ties to the
chemical company. Several are board members.
   In 1988, two great-grandsons of Ford Motor Co. founder Henry
Ford became the first of their generation elected to the board of
the automaker, still 40 percent owned by the Ford family. Both men
are also Ford executives.
   Some families have reasserted total control over their
businesses. Southland Corp.'s founding Thompson family, for
example, took the company private in a 1987 takeover, borrowing
money to repurchase the stock.
   Other families who preside over publicly held corporations want
to be sure they maintain control over their companies. So they've
issued different classes of stock with voting rights that puts most
power in family hands.
   Such an arrangement helped the Bryan family that owns Media
General Inc. defeat a takeover bid by investor Burt Sugarman in
1988. The family held about 71 percent of the company's Class B
shares, which controlled six of the nine seats on the Media General
board, allowing the family to easily defeat Sugarman's attempt to
win the other seats.
   But sometimes, when a company is losing money, a family must
choose the bottom line over emotional ties. In 1982 E.W. Scripps
Co. decided to sell United Press International, which had been
losing money for years.
   UPI was a project of company founder E.W. Scripps, who believed
in 1907 that American newspapers needed competing wire services.
Scripps Co. executives and members of the Scripps family decided 75
years later the subsidiary's losses were too much to carry any
longer.
   Ted Scripps, an E.W. Scripps grandson who shared his ancestor's
belief in competition among the wires, lobbied against a sale and
sought a way for Scripps Co. to keep UPI. But relatives told Ted
Scripps the family couldn't afford it.
   There are times when a company can become the pawn in a family
feud. That was the case in the Field family and in the notorious
1980s fight among members of Kentucky's Bingham family, owners of a
media empire.
   It began when Sallie Bingham challenged her brother as head of
the family business and then found herself off the board of
directors. After two years of bickering _ including a threat by Ms.
Bingham to sell her 15 percent stake _ her father, patriarch Barry
Bingham Sr., put an end to the fight and the family ties to the
business, selling its two newspapers, television station and
printing company.
   Bingham, who died in 1988, was forced to break his bonds with
newspapers his father bought in 1918.
   ``It is not easy for me to see The Courier-Journal and
Louisville Times pass from my family into other hands,'' he said in
announcing the sale in May 1986.
   But, he added, ``Change is an inevitable rule of life.''
