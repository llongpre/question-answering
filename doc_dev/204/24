   Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. said it plans to buy an undisclosed amount of its $1.2 billion current-coupon and zero-coupon convertible debentures outstanding due 2000. 

   Rockefeller Center Properties, a real estate investment trust formed in 1985 after the sale of assets by various members of the Rockefeller family, said the purchases would consist of $335 million face amount of current-coupon debentures and $952 million principal amount of its zero-coupon debentures due Dec. 31, 2000. 

   The current-coupon bonds are convertible into the company's common stock at a rate of 4.59 shares for each $1,000 principal amount, or $11.82 a share. 
Interest on the securities is payable annually at 8% to Dec. 31, 1994, and at 13% thereafter. 
The zero-coupon bonds, which don't pay interest, are convertible into the company's common at a rate of 46.06 shares per $1,000 principal amount, or $21.71 a share. 

   Both debt issues are trading at discounts of about 10% from their effective initial offering prices two years ago. 
"We believe the capital market hasn't recognized the fair value" of the securities, said Richard Scarlata, a vice president at Cushman &amp; Wakefield Realty Advisors Inc., which advises and administrates the Rockefeller real estate investment trust. 
Mr. Scarlata didn't disclose the amount or timing of its debenture purchases. 

   In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Rockefeller common stock closed at $18, up 12.5 cents.
