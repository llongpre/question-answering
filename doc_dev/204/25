   A new plaque declares the national landmark
status of Rockefeller Center, a complex of office buildings in
midtown Manhattan where some 65,000 people work.
   The plaque referring to the 13 oldest buildings in the
19-building center was unveiled Monday by National Park Service
head William Penn Mott Jr., who called the center ``a masterpiece
of city planning, architecture, landscape architecture and cultural
progress.''
   The buildings cited were built between 1931 and 1940 under the
direction of John D. Rockefeller Jr. They include the 70-story RCA
Building and Radio City Music Hall.
   Those buildings plus two others have already been designated
city landmarks, meaning they cannot be torn down or altered without
approval from the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. The
federal designation, announced in December, carries no restrictions.
