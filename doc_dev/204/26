   No one blinked when West Germans bought A&amp;P or
when Britons bought Burger King, not even when Swiss bought Mighty
Dog canned dog food. But Japanese buy Rockefeller Center and
suddenly you're hearing jokes about office workers having to take
their shoes off at the door.
   In reality, all was normal at the midtown Manhattan complex
Tuesday: The Rainbow Room did not replace its French wines with
sake; the American Festival Cafe did not introduce sushi; sumo
wrestlers did not shove aside the skaters on the ice rink; the
Rockettes were not kicked out of Radio City by Godzilla.
   But listen to Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who rose on
the floor of the Senate to warn: ``This year when they turn on the
lights to that Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center, we Americans
are going to have to come to grips with the reality that that great
national celebration is actually occurring on Japanese property.''
   Well, sort of. Mitsubishi Estate Co. is going to buy a
controlling interest in the company that owns Rockefeller Center
for $846 million, and it is the latest in a series of major
Japanese real estate purchases in this country.
   But the original 12-building portion of Rockefeller Center,
including Radio City, may not be controlled by Mitsubishi past the
year 2000, when public sareholders of a real estate investment
trust could take control.
   Meanwhile, the center will continue to be managed by the same
organization that has swept the sidewalks and polished the brass
for 50 years. The new owner will, at any rate, have to obey U.S.
laws, pay U.S. taxes, and generally observe U.S. customs if it
hopes to succeed in a competitive real estate rental market.
   Still, there seem to be jitters whenever Japanese citizens or
companies buy American these days.
   ``Many people have said to me, `Isn't there going to be a public
backlash about Japanese investment?''' Richard Voell, president of
the Rockefeller Group, said Tuesday.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he, too, had noticed an
``undercurrent'' of talk that the sale ``is a threat because the
new equity participants happen to be Japanese or not American
citizens.''
   And what did the mayor think about that?
   ``Ridiculous!'' bellowed Koch. ``It's called xenophobia, or,
`Gee, we're alone. Let's keep everybody out.' That's a worldwide
phenomenon and you would expect that it would exist in every
country, but that it would exist to a far lesser degree in ... an
international city like New York. ...
   ``I believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with foreigners''
investing in the city, the mayor added. ``Who cares? I mean, what
difference does it make?''
   Koyata Hosokawa, executive vice president of Mitsubishi Estate,
said American opposition to Japanese investment was ``an
unfortunate sentiment, but it's not a sentiment which (the
Japanese) are particularly troubled by.''
   The largest foreign investors in the United States are not the
Japanese, but the British, who last year invested twice as much as
the Japanese and held assets worth twice as much.
   Although Japanese investors have bought a few well-known
buildings, such as the Exxon building in Manhattan, their
acquisitions largely have been unremarkable. Fearing an
anti-Japanese backlash, the Tokyo government discouraged Japanese
companies from bidding on Chicago's Sears Tower, the world's
tallest building, when it was offered earlier this year.
   ``You know, it's funny, a British or a West German company can
buy something here and you don't hear much about it,'' said
Moriyuki Sawamoto, head of the New York office of a Japanese
economic research firm. ``But if it's a Japanese company, that's
right up in the headline.''
   To Sawamoto, the Rockefeller Center deal seemed like the most
logical thing in the world. Mitsubishi is a conservative, long-term
investor that's willing to pay top price for a world-famous complex
with a peerless location.
   ``No one forced the Rockefeller Group to sell,'' he said. ``They
went to Mitsubishi.''
   Sawamoto was a student at Vanderbilt University 32 years ago
when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. He remembers how Americans,
accustomed to a decade of global supremacy, were suddenly scared
and frightened by one little satellite.
   ``These days you are not Number 1 at everything, but you can
still be the Number 1 nation,'' he said. ``You shouldn't be too
excited or threatened by day-to-day events.''
