   In one corner, there's Sen. John D.
Rockefeller IV, heir to one of America's biggest fortunes and
holding a $2.1 million PAC-packed war chest, seeking nomination to
a second six-year term.
   In the others stand an art professor who refuses to campaign and
a self-proclaimed inventor-lawyer who doesn't do interviews.
   Jay Rockefeller has spent $300,000 so far in the race to the May
8 Democratic primary. The art professor, Paul Nuchims, has spent
less than $500.
   A fourth candidate withdrew, saying he couldn't afford to
challenge Rockefeller.
   The winner faces Republican John Yoder, 39, a Harpers Ferry
lawyer and a onetime aide to former Chief Justice Warren Burger, in
November.
   Yoder has dubbed Rockefeller ``PAC man of the year.''
   But Rockefeller claims the money won't sway him.
   ``I think the one really clear thing about Jay Rockefeller that
the people of West Virginia understand extremely well is that the
only boss that Jay Rockefeller has, the only accountability he has,
is to the people,'' he said in a recent telephone interview.
   Rockefeller, 52, great-grandson of Standard Oil founder John D.
Rockefeller and nephew of Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller,
moved to Appalachia in 1964 to fight poverty, then moved into
politics. A former two-term West Virginia governor, he narrowly won
election to the Senate in 1984.
   Rockefeller cites among his accomplishments in office pushing
for drug education in schools and enactment of a law requiring U.S.
automakers to develop vehicles that run on methanol, which is made
partly from coal _ which is important to West Virginians.
   As a freshman senator, Rockefeller generally has voted as a
liberal, opposing the Strategic Defense Initiative and aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras but supporting the minimum wage increase and
60-day notice for plant closings.
   In West Virginia, he has been attacked for advocating Japanese
investment in the United States, which critics say jeopardizes
America's independence.
   To that, he answers: ``When foreign investment, from whatever
source, puts West Virginians to work, then I say it can be good for
West Virginia.''
   But the biggest complaints about Rockefeller since he entered
state politics have focused on his money. His campaigns have earned
him a name as a free-spending scion who buys his way into office.
   He spent $9 million in his 1980 gubernatorial run and $12
million in the 1984 Senate race.
   This time, he has raised $2.1 million, including $800,000 from
political action committees, according to campaign financial
statements.
   Nuchims, 55, of St. Albans, says his biggest donation to date
was $50. He said he's opposing Rockefeller just ``to get the ideas
out to the people.''
   A one-time gubernatorial candidate, Nuchims has refused to
campaign, choosing instead to exhibit his politically oriented
artwork.
   ``I do not wish power or glory, but somebody has to exude some
modicum of leadership for the state. West Virginia is, economically
and leadership-wise, bankrupt,'' he said.
   Chairman of the art department at West Virginia State College,
Nuchims says he supports a national education policy, competency
testing for teachers and restriction of foreign investment.
   The other candidate, Ken B. Thompson, of Morgantown, did not
return numerous telephone calls and has no listed campaign
headquarters. He did, however, tell one newspaper by mail that he
is a former U.S. State Department aide, a lawyer and an inventor.
   Rockefeller chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive
Health Care, also called the Pepper Commission, which recommended a
jobs-based universal health insurance plan.
   It called for full coverage for everyone within five years and
said employers would have to provide insurance or contribute to a
public plan.
   But the commission refused to include recommendations on how to
pay the estimated $23 billion cost.
