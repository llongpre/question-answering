HOLLYWOOD'S HOT -- but really hot -- producer, Don Simpson, is making his 
acting debut in James Toback's coming controversial movie, "The Big Bang." This 
one received an ovation at the recent Telluride Film Festival and is all about 
real people baring their souls on the subjects of life, death, sex, and the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson has grown rich and famous as a producer. He and partner Jerry 
Bruckheimer did "Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop," and "Top Gun." But Don 
recently lost about 40 pounds and became a health and fitness nut. 
</P>
<P>
So now he'll also play the role of the racing driver Aldo Benadetti in the 
coming Tom Cruise film, "Days of Thunder." Filming begins Nov. 17 in North 
Carolina, Florida and Arizona.

MALCOLM FORBES, Marella Agnelli and Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat laid on 
cocktails in the Forbes gallery in New York for their coming "Masquerade" gala 
happening Dec. 1 to honor AmFAR's Elizabeth Taylor. I had two dates for this 
one -- Hollywood's rising personal manager Keith Addis and his brand new 
partner, Nick Wechsler, who co-produced and produced "sex, lies and videotape," 
as well as "Drugstore Cowboy." These guys have formed a management-production 
company that will be an L.A. organization of note. (Addis manages Sting, Jeff 
Goldblum, Mimi Rogers, Steve Guttenberg and people like that.)

HERE's the real reason why David Rockefeller sold the famous Rockefeller Center 
to the sons-of-Mitsubishis. There are more than 100 accredited heirs to the 
sprawling Rockefeller fortune. Once upon a time, theirs was a name to conjure 
with all over the United States and they were the "masters of the universe" of 
their day. Today, the Rockefellers are considered "pikers" when it comes to 
wealth and are only middling rich by Nouvelle Society standards. 
</P>
<P>
Those in charge felt the tax situation would be onerous upon the deaths of 
Laurence and David Rockefeller. They felt that the other heirs need money NOW 
to protect their futures. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Rockefellers sell cheap? Some insiders think so. These smarties 
estimate that the real value of Rockefeller Center is around $4 billion. The 
Rockefellers sold to the Japanese for only $846 million.

FINALLY CAUGHT up with Faye Dunaway on TNT-TV's "Cold Sassy Tree." Lo and 
behold, this is Faye's most subtle and moving performance in years. She has 
admirably subdued herself. (Those electric gestures and that high voltage 
personality have at times been an albatross around her talented neck. She was 
just too much for audiences to take -- or to take seriously.) 
</P>
<P>
In "Cold Sassy Tree," the star is in complete control. This is miles away from 
the pyrotechnics of "Mommie Dearest" and is a finer piece of work than her more 
recent, acclaimed, but largely unseen movie, "Barfly." 
</P>
<P>
If Faye Dunaway is lucky and gets more good scripts, she could begin to make 
those younger stars -- Streep, Turner, Pfeiffer, Foster -- just a little bit 
nervous.
