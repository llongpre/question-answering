   In yet another Japanese takeover of an American
institution, Mitsubishi Estate Co. plans to pay $846 million for
control of the company that owns Rockefeller Center and Radio City
Music Hall.
   The announcement late Monday by Mitsubishi, one of Japan's
largest real estate companies, follows last month's takeover of
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. by Japan's Sony Corp. for $3.4
billion. It also continues a trend of major Japanese real estate
purchases in the United States.
   Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns and manages the 19-building
Rockefeller Center complex in Manhattan, is a legacy of a family
whose name stands for American capitalism. The family, which
controls the private company, traces its fortune to John D.
Rockefeller, who founded the Standard Oil Co.
   The old 12-building Art Deco portion of Rockefeller Center,
including Radio City Music Hall, most likely will not be controlled
by Mitsubishi past the year 2000. Public shareholders of a real
estate investment trust are expected to take control that year.
   For Mitsubishi, the more valuable assets are the Time-Life
Building and a 50 percent interest in the McGraw-Hill Building,
which are in the newer portion of Rockefeller Center; as well as
the nationwide Cushman &amp; Wakefield commercial real estate brokerage
and prime real estate parcels in New York and New Jersey.
   Last month, Rockefeller Group confirmed media reports that it
was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company. The
reports indicated that some Rockefeller family members wanted more
income from their investments. Most of the family members'
inheritance is tied up in real estate and other holdings.
   But the independent trust committee that manages the family's
holdings said Monday the money from the sale to Mitsubishi would be
reinvested in other Rockefeller Group operations, and would not be
paid out to family members.
   William G. Bowen, chairman of the trust committee, said one
objective of the sale was to diversify the company's holdings,
which are concentrated in real estate.
   ``The sale of a large block of shares to Mitsubishi was approved
because it offered a most unusual opportunity to enhance the
long-term prospects of the Rockefeller Group and Rockefeller Center
while simultaneously rebalancing the trust portfolio,'' Bowen said.
   In a statement, David Rockefeller, Rockefeller Group's chairman
and son of John D. Rockefeller Jr., said, ``Our agreement with
Mitsubishi Estate preserves the abiding commitment to Rockefeller
Center and New York City which my father made more than 50 years
ago, and which present generations of the family continue to feel.''
   Rockefeller Group officials said the company's board, its
advisers and the trust committee considered other options, such as
a recapitalization funded by debt, before they decided on the stock
sale. The closing date of the deal was not announced.
   Mitsubishi's 51 percent ownership of the older portion of
Rockefeller Center is likely to diminish to about 14 percent in the
year 2000.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 billion mortgage on the historic portion of
the center east of Avenue of the Americas. It then sold shares in
that mortgage to the public through a real estate investment trust.
   In the year 2000 the trust has the option of converting those
shares into ownership stakes in the older portion of Rockefeller
Center that would put 71.5 percent of the complex in the public's
hands.
   Conversion of the shares appears likely because the properties
involved in the trust already are worth $1.8 billion, according to
an appraisal at the end of last year.
   The conversion would leave just 28.5 percent of the older
portion of Rockefeller Center under the joint ownership of
Mitsubishi Estate and the Rockefellers.
   The Rockefeller family fortune was estimated at $900 million in
1911, when the Standard Oil trust was busted into several
companies. Today, Forbes magazine estimates the combined family
fortune at over $5 billion.
   John D. Rockefeller's son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created five
trusts for his children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal
owners of Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D.
Rockefeller Jr. the main beneficiaries.
   The 22-acre Rockefeller Center complex includes the 65-story
General Electric Building, formerly called the RCA Building, which
contains the Rainbow Room and NBC's headquarters; Radio City Music
Hall, home of the Rockettes; a famed outdoor ice-skating rink; the
Time-Life building, and The Associated Press Building, headquarters
of the news service.
   The original part of the center was built in the 1930s in an Art
Deco style as one of the nation's first large-scale urban
developments and is classified as a National Historic Landmark. The
center was later expanded with a row of modern skyscrapers west of
Avenue of the Americas.
   Its buildings are the home of many well-known corporations, such
as Time Warner Inc., McGraw-Hill Inc. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc.
Among the newer buildings, the Exxon Building was sold about three
years ago to Japan's Mitsui &amp; Co. for $620 million and is now being
vacated by Exxon, which is moving headquarters to Texas. The
Celanese building is owned by JMB Realty of Chicago and the
McGraw-Hill Building is half-owned by McGraw-Hill.
   Rockefeller Group's other businesses include: Rockefeller Center
Development Corp., Rockefeller Center Management Corp., Rockefeller
Group Telecommunications Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc., and the 40-office Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in which
the company holds an 80 percent stake.
   Mitsubishi Estate, which is publicly traded and has historical
ties to the auto company of the same name, is one of Japan's
largest real estate companies. Its other major U.S. investments
include partnerships that built a $500 million office building at
Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles and a 2,300-acre resort complex at
Palm Desert, Calif.
