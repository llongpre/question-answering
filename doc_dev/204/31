   Along with several hundred jobs, Exxon Corp. is
moving 107 years of history when it relocates its corporate
headquarters to Texas from midtown Manhattan.
   Since its creation in 1882 as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey,
Exxon has grown from a domestic kerosene maker into the world's
largest multinational oil conglomerate, with 1988 sales of $87.5
billion and more than 180,000 employees worldwide.
   On Thursday, Exxon announced it was moving its corporate
headquarters and 300 jobs to Dallas, joining a number of other
major companies that have left the Northeast in recent years for
the Sunbelt.
   Standard Oil of New Jersey was one of 40 separate petroleum
companies organized in 1882 under the Standard Oil Trust formed by
John D. Rockefeller.
   The original Standard Oil Co. was formed by Rockefeller in 1870
and incorporated in Ohio. In 1911, the Standard Oil organization
was dissolved under U.S. antitrust laws and the various companies
under the trust became independent.
   Standard Oil of New Jersey opened its first headquarters in
lower Manhattan, across New York harbor from its main facilities
that at that time included a paraffin plant, a barrel factory and a
refinery capable of processing 2,000 barrels a day of crude oil
shipped from oil fields in western Pennsylvania.
   In 1919, the company bought 50 percent interest in Humble Oil
and Refining, which eventually became Exxon U.S.A. based in Houston.
   In 1972, Standard Oil of New Jersey changed its name to Exxon
Corp. Before changing its name, the company marketed gasoline and
other products under a variety of trademarks, including Standard,
Esso, Humble and Carter. Many of its overseas affiliates still use
the name Esso.
   Since its founding, Exxon has expanded to 100 countries
worldwide, exploring, producing, refining and marketing oil. Its
businesses also include coal, hydrocarbon energy, natural gas,
rubber, minerals mining and nuclear energy and high technology.
   Exxon now owns or has interests in 25,000 miles of underground
pipelines _ enough to circle the earth at the equator _ and
maintains one of the world's biggest fleets of oil-transporting
vessels.
   It has refineries in 25 countries. Its five U.S. refineries are
capable of processing about 1.5 million barrels a day of crude oil
into some 1,000 products, ranging from motor fuels to special
lubricants for use in outer space.
   Exxon's leadership history includes such corporate figures as
Rockefeller himself, who served as chairman from 1899 to 1911.
   The place of Lawrence G. Rawl, who has been chairman since
January 1987, in company annals has been marked by one of the most
tumultuous periods in Exxon's history.
   A March 24 oil spill by an Exxon tanker in Alaska's Prince
William Sound was the nation's worst such disaster ever, and has
subjected the company to harsh criticism by politicians,
environmentalists and consumer groups.
   Exxon's home base shared in the ignominy in May, when people
claiming to be Alaskans protested the spill by dumping oil into the
fountain outside the midtown Manhattan skyscraper that houses the
company's corporate headquarters.
   The company offices are in a landmark, 54-story skyscraper known
as the Exxon Building. Exxon and Rockefeller Group Inc. sold the
building in 1986 to a large Japanese insurance conglomerate, Mitsui
&amp; Co. for $610 million _ at the time the largest single real estate
transaction in Manhattan history.
