   The dollar ended higher Tuesday against key
currencies in quiet trading, and some dealers said the $846 million
deal by Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Japan for control of New York's
landmark Rockefeller Center helped support the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices fell following a mixed performance overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $374.70 a troy ounce, down $3.10 from late
Monday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of
$373.30 an ounce, down $3.35.
   Currency dealers said internal market influences largely pushed
the dollar higher. But they said higher share prices on Wall Street
and the Rockefeller Center purchase also supported the dollar,
particularly against the Japanese yen.
   ``It's a large amount of money and obviously it has to be
converted,'' from yen to dollars, noted Robert Ryan, a senior
trader at Bank of New York.
   Mitsubishi agreed to pay $846 million to buy a 51 percent stake
in Rockefeller Group Inc., whose most famous asset is Rockefeller
Center.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 142.15 yen, down from Monday's 142.17
yen. It traded at 142.69 yen late in London, and at 142.87 yen in
New York, up from 141.87 yen late Monday.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound. One pound
cost $1.5775 late Tuesday in London, cheaper than Monday's $1.5785.
Sterling fetched $1.5805 in New York, down from $1.5825 late Monday.
   However, the pound continued to rebound against other currencies
in Europe following its plunge Friday after Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's abrupt resignation. Lawson's successor,
John Major, stressed Tuesday that he intended to follow current
policies, fight inflation and maintain a strong pound.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8420 West German marks, up from 1.8340; 1.6160
Swiss francs, up from 1.6050; 6.2510 French francs, up from 6.2265;
1.1740 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1735; and 1,352.50 Italian lire,
up from 1,346.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.8410 West German marks, up from 1.8360; 1.6142 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6065; 6.2445 French francs, up from 6.2325;
2.0730 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0727; 1.1742 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1747; and 1,349.75 Italian lire, up from 1,348.00.
   Gold closed in London at $377.75 an ounce, up from $376.75
Monday. The late bid price in Zurich, Switzerland, was $375.00 an
ounce, down from $376.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $375.95 an ounce, down
from $378.85.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex silver bullion for
current delivery closed at $5.180 a troy ounce, down from $5.243.
Silver fell in London to $5.21 an ounce from $5.22.
