   Rockefeller Center was still a muddy
construction site when Christmas was first celebrated around its
now-famous tree.
   That was in 1931, in the midst of the Depression, when
construction workers happy to be employed got their Christmas Eve
paychecks around the tree they had set up in the dirt.
   Two years later, the formal tree lighting tradition at the
midtown Manhattan site began when the tree was decorated with 700
lights and placed in front of the then-8-month-old RCA Building. In
1936, the Rockefeller Plaza outdoor ice skating rink was opened.
   This year's tree lighting, with more than 18,000 multicolored
lights, takes place at 5:30 p.m. Dec. 5 and will be nationally
televised later that evening.
   The tree is a 75-foot Norway spruce from Raritan Township, N.J.
   Other Christmas attractions at Rockefeller Center are the
display of trumpeting angels in the adjacent Channel Gardens and
the ``TubaChristmas'' concert, set for Dec. 11.
   The Christmas show at Radio City Music Hall runs from Nov. 11
through Jan. 4.
