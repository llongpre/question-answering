A partnership led by David Rockefeller said Thursday that it will build its 
first Southern California project here -- a $100-million complex across the 
street from Anaheim Stadium that will include two 13-story office buildings and 
a 150-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a stone wall and several rings of trees, the 12-acre Central Park 
Towers project is intended to look like a scaled-down version of New York 
City's Central Park. It will be more lavishly landscaped than most of the 
office buildings in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the usual tinted glass that most Orange County office buildings 
sport, the office towers by Rockefeller &amp; Associates Realty will probably 
have exteriors of precast concrete designed to look like marble. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockefeller partnership is a development and investment company based in 
San Francisco. Its predecessor developed that city's big Embarcadero Center 
office and hotel complex. David Rockefeller, one of the wealthy family's more 
prominent members, is the chairman and major owner. Most of the other investors 
are his New York business associates. 
</P>
<P>
The project comes at a time when the nation's top banking regulators have 
warned lenders to be wary of overbuilt real estate markets, Orange County among 
them. The office vacancy rate in Orange County exceeds 20%. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rockefeller partnership is betting that it can exploit a lull in 
construction around the stadium and open the complex when that office market 
gets tighter several years from now. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said it picked Anaheim -- a less prestigious business address than 
Irvine or Newport Beach -- because the office markets in those cities are not 
expected to improve as quickly as Anaheim's. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership has agreed to buy the Anaheim property from several owners for 
$12.7 million. The sale is expected to close this summer. Construction of the 
578,000-square-foot office development is scheduled to begin next spring and to 
finish during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The project has yet to be approved by the city, but Rockefeller &amp; 
Associates officials said they do not anticipate any major problems when it 
goes before the City Council in September. 
</P>
<P>
Whether both office towers will be built at the same time depends on the number 
of tenants that can be signed up before construction, said Timothy B. Good, an 
Irvine developer and a partner in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Good said the partners are negotiating with four hotel companies to run the 
small hotel and that a deal is near. Original plans called for the hotel to 
have 350 rooms, Good said, but it was scaled down when he found that big hotel 
companies had saturated the Anaheim market and were not interested in running 
another big full-service hotel. This hotel is to be an all-suite facility 
designed for extended stays. 
</P>
<P>
Central Park Towers will also include a big restaurant and several smaller 
eateries and shops. The stadium area, once an industrial neighborhood, does not 
have many shops or restaurants, so office developers usually provide them. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership spent a year looking at Southern California before deciding on 
Orange County, said Bill Hatch, president and managing partner of Rockefeller 
&amp; Associates. It is still studying other investments, which it will not 
disclose, in the county. Rockefeller &amp; Associates also bought a business 
park in La Jolla in San Diego County this spring. 
</P>
<P>
(Rockefeller &amp; Associates is not part of the family's Rockefeller Group, 
which owns Rockefeller Center in New York City. That company made news last 
year when it sold 51% of itself and its landmark Manhattan building to 
Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Japan.) 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, at least three major developers have already obtained city 
permission to build office towers around the stadium, which is home to the 
California Angels baseball and the Rams football teams. 
</P>
<P>
But at least some of those buildings probably will not be constructed, Good 
said, because finding money to build has recently become much harder. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of office space coming on the market won't be nearly as great as 
you might think," he said, "because players in the capital markets are getting 
hard to find as dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts are out of the picture after the savings and loan debacle, the banks 
are leery of real estate, and big investors -- pension funds and insurance 
companies -- are also being more cautious. Some, in fact, are trying to sell 
buildings they already own in Orange County because the market is so soft. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., recently 
cited Orange County as one the places bank regulators believe is overbuilt. 
Local and state officials, however, said federal officials failed to consider 
the area's continuing population growth and its strong absorption rate (the 
rate at which new space is leased). 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are still plenty of tenants, real estate brokers said. But 
developers have built so many buildings that they must offer low rents and 
other incentives to persuade tenants to sign a lease. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a tenants' market right now, and landlords are giving up quite a 
lot in the way of concessions, but it's not as bad as it was a year and a half 
ago," said Mike Martin, a partner in the brokerage Lee &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Orange County market is already tightening up, brokers say, and 
office rents are getting higher. 
</P>
<P>
The competition for tenants is a big problem in the Newport Beach and Irvine 
neighborhoods around John Wayne Airport, where big developers have preferred to 
build. Add the traffic jams and the high cost of housing in those cities, Hatch 
said, and the Anaheim market begins to look more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1986, older cities such as Anaheim and Santa Ana, with their run-down 
urban neighborhoods, were generally passed over as sites for office towers. 
Then, until 1988, developers built office towers in those areas. The developers 
stopped building, though, when most of the offices were not leased quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Among the developers were some of the biggest in the county -- Hutton 
Development, the Koll Co., Hillman Properties. Most of them have city 
permission to build even more towers near the stadium, although none has 
announced plans to do so yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Rockefeller perceives a window of opportunity here," said John Owen, a 
vice president at Cushman &amp; Wakefield in Orange County, a commercial real 
estate brokerage owned by the Rockefeller Group. "A lot of space came on the 
market in 1988, and there's a hesitancy for the next guy to jump in and build 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Backed with Rockefeller's financial muscle, loans to build the project will be 
easy to obtain, Good said. 
</P>
<P>
He and Dave Dawson, another developer, are limited partners in the project. 
David Rockefeller is putting up all the money from partnership and will own the 
vast majority of the project. Good, who conceived Central Park Towers in his 
former job with McKellar Development and Dawson, former chairman of the 
Stanford Ranch planned community near Sacramento, will receive an unspecified 
small percentage of the ownership for helping develop and market Central Park 
Towers. 
</P>
<P>
There is the risk that another wave of construction will dump another large 
amount of office space and high vacancy rate on the central county market 
several years from now. 
</P>
<P>
That's OK, Hatch said. "We build and own projects for the long term," he said. 
"And central Orange County is a lot more valuable than people give it credit 
for. We see it eventually developing into an extremely important, high-quality 
location."
