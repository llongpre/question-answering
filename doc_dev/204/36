   The city's best-known harbinger of Christmas,
the tree at Rockefeller Center, was set aglow Monday to the oohs
and ahs of thousands of spectators who were undeterred by cold and
rainy weather.
   The 20,000 multicolored lights adorning the 75-foot Norway
spruce that towers over the skating rink were turned on about 5:30
p.m.
   The half-hour ceremony accompanying the tree lighting featured
singer-actress Liza Minnelli as host, with appearances by skating
champions Judy Blumberg, Michael Siebert and Olympic gold medalist
Robin Cousins; Minnelli's sister, singer Lorna Luft; and a segment
from the Radio City Musical Hall Christmas Spectacular.
   Clara ``Mother'' Hale, founder of Hale House, a home for infants
born to drug-addicted mothers, delivered a Christmas message.
   The tree, selected from a private home in West Norwalk, Conn.,
arrived at Rockefeller Center on Nov. 16. For the past two weeks,
workers have been readying the tree, stringing more than 5 miles of
lights.
   The tree, the 58th to appear at the site, will remain until Jan.
2.
