<LEADPARA>  CAN A SENATOR living in a $15.3 million mansion with 11 bathrooms run for
president as a populist?;    Can the scion of America's deep-pocket dynasty
sound believable when he lashes George Bush as "the president of the wealthy

<TEXT>     Can America's richest politician run for the White House as a Democratic
defender of poor kids, the uninsured sick and the hard-pressed middle class?; 
  It's a strong guess that Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va. -- "Jay" to
you -- is going to try.;    He's a gangly, 6-6, earnest, naive man who served
(critics say "bought") two terms as West Virginia governor. By mid-September
he'll probably leap into the thin Democratic field challenging Bush in '92.
Then comes the riddle: Will Democrats tumble for a super-rich progressive
carrying the baggage of the Rockefeller name?;    Sure, we've had big-buck
presidents -- Jack Kennedy in 1960 for one. And the Senate is stuffed with
millionaires. But the Rockefeller fortune, thanks to the 19th-century founder
of Standard Oil, makes them look like paupers.;    Jay Rockefeller listed his
assets at $4.1 million on his Senate form. Forbes magazine's estimate is more
eye-boggling: $150 million.;    On early forays around the country, pushing
for his pet project, national health care, Sen. Rockefeller is trying to
defang the Richest Guy in Politics image with laughter.;    "Other kids grew
up playing with plastic blocks," he said Wednesday. "My blocks were 48th
Street, 49th Street, Fifth Avenue . . .";    And: "Others found success by
working hard. I just inherited it. And you know, I've never regretted it.";   
OK, he's no Jay Leno. In truth, Rockefeller did work hard as a VISTA volunteer
in the West Virginia hills. He was a decent governor, even if his first two
campaigns cost him $25 million from his own wallet. (Bumper stickers for rival
Arch Moore said, "Make Him Spend It All, Arch." Rockefeller rooters retorted,
"At Least It's His.");    When he faced AFL-CIO members here Wednesday,
Rockefeller sounded like a flat-out presidential candidate. He made the
fiercest attack on Bush of any Democrat this year. But when he tongue-lashed
Bush as the protector of the American upper class, well, it had a peculiar
ring for a Rockefeller.;    Like Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., earlier,
Rockefeller skewered Bush for using race as a political distraction. But
Rockefeller was tougher. You can't get more personal than calling a president
a liar.;    "Bush is lying to the American people and his own conscience, if
he has one, about quotas," Rockefeller said. "He loves to talk about quotas,
just as he was proud of that Willie Horton ad. That diverts attention, makes
people angry. It elected Jesse Helms. That's a helluva deal.";    Rockefeller
was warming up: "No wonder he plays politics of greed and fear. If George Bush
had to run on his record, he'd be run out of town. I watched Reagan-Bush
savage West Virginia for eight years. I'm sick of the charade -- talking about
quotas, ignoring our problems at home as we lose jobs overseas, because it
doesn't affect their kind.";    Their kind?;    Rockefeller ignored his family
millions as he raked Bush as a silver-spoon Yalie fat cat.;    "He doesn't
really care about day-to-day problems of American families," said Rockefeller.
"His whole life has been privilege and staying away from trenches and hard
work and small, tough communities.";    It was startling to hear a Rockefeller
rip into country-club Republicans, accusing Reagan-Bush of jacking up the
wealth of America's top 1 percent by 121 percent.;    "That's who they
(Republicans) protect," seethed Jay Rockefeller. "That's where they get their
campaign contributions. That's who they play golf with. That's who they go to
Palm Springs with, these people.";    These people?;    True, the Rockefellers
were America's most generous philanthropists. The clan has included some good
politicians, notably Jay's uncle Nelson. But savaging the Republican rich
sounds strange coming from a fourth-generation Rockefeller.;    Will
Rockefeller's paradox sell on the campaign trail? His boyish, do-good
sincerity has appeal. He's no phony, attested by his work with the bipartisan
National Children's Commission and his Senate health crusade for 37 million
uninsured Americans.;    But Rockefeller may be naively ahead of the political
curve. He's preaching populism when budgets are tight, voters are cynical of
big government. Joe Sixpack may shrug, "Let Rockefeller pay for his programs
-- I can't.";    He also seems to be fumbling his way onto the national
campaign scene, a rookie not quite ready to hit reporters' curve balls. But
Democrats may forgive Rockefeller's gaucheries. He showed Wednesday he can
generate white-hot anger at the incumbent president.;    His ultimate needle
to Bush: "He only went into the gulf war to dewimp himself.";    I hope Jay
Rockefeller runs, even if he has to pick up the tab. The '92 campaign needs
the novel entertainment of a Rockefeller raging against the pampered upper
crust.;    Maybe Jay Rockefeller and Bush would contend in a po' boy contest.
You know, which one really loves pork rinds, baseball and country-and-western
music. (box)  </TEXT>
