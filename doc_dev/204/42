   The North Tarrytown Board of
Trustees has approved a zoning change that clears the way for
turning John D. Rockefeller's home into a museum.
   But it will be at least a year before the public can tour the
four-story Georgian mansion in the Pocantico Hills area, said Robert
Snyder, president of Greenrock Corp., which manages the Rockefeller
family's estates.
   The zoning change was approved Wednesday night. Mount Pleasant
changed its zoning in June. The property straddles the towns.
   The 86-acre property is part of the 250-acre Rockefeller park,
which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. The
mansion houses an art collection and has an outdoor sculpture garden
and a coach barn.
   Nelson Rockefeller left the property to the National Trust for
Historic Preservation when he died in 1979 and stipulated that a
plan be developed to open it to the public and preserve its history.
