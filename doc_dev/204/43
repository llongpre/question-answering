   NEW YORK -- David Rockefeller Jr. was elected chairman of
Rockefeller Financial Services Inc., succeeding his father at
the helm of the holding company for the Rockefeller family
business interests and philanthropies.
   The company said the election of Mr. Rockefeller, 50 years
old, who had been vice chairman, "represents a significant
step in positioning Rockefeller Financial Services so that it
can most effectively serve future generations of the
Rockefeller company." His father, former chairman of Chase
Manhattan Corp., had been chairman of the family company
since 1981. A spokesman for the company said the elder Mr.
Rockefeller, 76, will continue to work on his special
interests, including serving on an advisory committee for New
York Mayor David Dinkins and on some philanthropies.
