   Take off the expensive suit, the suspenders, the
designer socks, the silk shirt, and what would O. Stillman
Rockefeller be? Just another scantily clad millionaire selling
underwear.
   The 30-year-old Rockefeller _ a descendant of William
Rockefeller, brother of John D. Rockefeller Sr. _ will soon be seen
modeling Jockey brand underwear.
   It's all for charity.
   One of his fellow underwear salesmen is Jim Palmer, former
Baltimore Oriole and Hall of Fame pitcher.
   Rockefeller, who normally works with artist Mark Kostabi, will
donate his fee for doing the ad to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, publicist Natasha Devli, said Tuesday. The first ad, which
will be print only, is set to appear in the next issue of Forbes
magazine.
