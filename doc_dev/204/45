   Attica Correctional Facility inmates have
no claim against Nelson Rockefeller's estate for deaths that
occurred during a violent prison uprising in 1971, a federal judge
has ruled.
   A former state corrections commissioner, former state police
officials and New York National Guard officials remain defendants
in the $2 billion lawsuit.
   Although Rockefeller, then governor, gave state police the
go-ahead to retake the prison from rebelling inmates on Sept. 13,
1971, he can't be held legally responsible for the 39 deaths that
resulted, U.S. District Judge John Elfvin said Friday.
   Rockefeller had ``no personal involvement in unlawful or
indiscriminate use of force,'' Elfvin found. ``There is no question
regarding his role and its legality.''
   Attorneys representing 1,281 Attica inmates filed the lawsuit 14
years ago. They can appeal the ruling to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   Elfvin's ruling is seen as a major disappointment to the inmates
because none of the other defendants approach Rockefeller's wealth.
   The ruling is a victory for Rockefeller's heirs, who have been
prevented by the suit from inheriting an estate worth more than
$66.5 million. The former vice president and governor died of a
heart attack in 1979.
   Elizabeth Fink, lead attorney for the inmates, was out of her
Brooklyn office and unavailable for comment, her secretary said.
   Twenty-nine Attica prisoners and 10 people taken hostage by the
inmates were killed when authorities stormed the western New York
prison five days after an inmate revolt.
   Elfvin pointed out that he was only ruling on Rockefeller's
involvement in the retaking of the prison and not on the question
of whether improper force was used.
   After negotiations broke down, Rockefeller gave permission for
police to storm the prison but to use firearms only if their lives
or the lives of hostages were endangered. Other than that,
Rockefeller had no actual role in the planning of the assault,
Elfvin said.
