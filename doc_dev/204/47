   The Japanese government has urged caution by
companies considering purchases of U.S. corporations and
properties, but the suggestion appears to be having little
influence.
   Mitsubishi Estate's purchase of a majority stake in Rockefeller
Group Inc. _ owner of New York's famed Rockefeller Center _ on the
heels of Sony Corp.'s $3.4 billion buyout of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. has heightened concern in the United States over
Japanese control of U.S. assets.
   Japanese companies and government officials are acutely aware of
the controversy and public relations officers are working overtime.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe expressed concern this
week about a possible American backlash and suggested that
businesses weighing U.S. investments could ``come up and ask our
opinion.''
   But analysts say government influence over such decisions is
waning.
   ``Clearly there is no grand national coordination. It would be
in the (Japanese) national interest if everyone cooled it for a
while, but who wants to be the first to hold back?'' says Japanese
business expert James Abegglen.
   As individual firms charge ahead, business associations are
working to reduce ``investment friction.''
   The Council for Better Corporate Citizenship, led by Sony
Chairman Akio Morita, disseminates information on how to
participate in community activities and avoid racism and sexism to
smooth relations in overseas subsidiaries.
   Industry analysts say some major real estate firms are avoiding
buying landmark U.S. buildings because of the attention they
attract. Companies in many industries are increasingly sensitive to
public relations. Japanese executives of American subsidiaries of
Mitsui Real Estate Development Co., one of the most aggressive
Japanese developers in the United States, are active in raising
money for the United Way.
   Tokyo analysts were surprised that a conservative company like
Mitsubishi would risk possible negative reaction to a high-profile
deal involving Rockefeller Center, especially so soon after the
Sony-Columbia deal.
   But some suggested the company may believe its conservative
image and prestigious name would reassure critics that it had
Rockefeller Center's best interests at heart.
   It was the Rockefeller Group that was eager to conclude the deal
and wanted Mitsubishi to take a majority stake, even though the
Japanese firm wanted to proceed at a slower pace, said Mitsubishi
spokesman James Rudy.
   The Rockefeller Group also approached Mitsui Real Estate, Nippon
Life Insurance Co. and several other firms about investing before
Mitsubishi concluded the deal, said spokesmen for the Japanese
firms. Although the companies declined to comment on their reasons
for not pursuing the deal, several major newspapers reported they
were concerned about possible backlash.
   The Japanese press gives heavy coverage to American reaction to
Japanese business activities.
   Immediately after the announcement of the Mitsubishi deal,
Japanese camera crews were on the streets of New York interviewing
Americans for their reaction. Japanese news organizations phoned
American correspondents in Tokyo to ask what ``nuance'' they were
giving their stories.
   When the Sony-Columbia deal was featured on the cover of
Newsweek, it was picked up by local media and prompted criticism of
American ``overreaction.''
   ``We cannot help feeling that some (American reactions) are
overly emotional,'' commented the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Outspoken lawmaker Shintaro Ishihara blames American ``racism'' in
part.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Watanabe noted after the Mitsubishi
deal that similar purchases by British and Dutch investors did not
raise the same unease among Americans.
   But at the same time they criticize American reactions, many
Japanese businessmen and government officials are acutely aware of
and even sympathetic to American sentiments about Japanese
investment.
   ``It is important that Japanese corporations act in
consideration of these feelings,'' the Asahi Shimbun said after the
Sony-Columbia deal.
   The paper said one reason for American resentment is that
``while Japanese firms can take over U.S. firms easily, the reverse
is not true.'' It suggested the situation should be changed.
   Some Japanese are surprised there is not stronger reaction
against foreign buyouts. The reaction to Mitsubishi's purchase
among New Yorkers appeared to be largely positive. Mayor Edward
Koch welcomed the deal.
   Japanese national television broadcast comments from New Yorkers
on the street saying, ``It's a good thing _ we need the
investment,'' ``It's a free country,'' and ``It's your money _ you
can do what you want with it.''
   On hearing these comments, one Japanese newscaster shook his
head in disbelief.
   ``Would we say the same thing if a Korean or a Hong Kong
conglomerate came and bought up a piece of Marunouchi (the prime
business district in Tokyo owned by Mitsubishi)?'' he asked.
