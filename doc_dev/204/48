   Exxon Corp. and Rockefeller Group Inc. said they agreed to sell their jointly owned midtown Manhattan office tower to Mitsui Fudosan (New York) Inc. for $610 million. 

   Exxon said the sale of its interest will result in a nonrecurring gain of about $246 million, or 34 cents a share, in the fourth quarter. 
The sale to Mitsui Fudosan, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Mitsui Real Estate Development Co., is expected to be completed by the end of the month. 

   The 53-story structure, known as the Exxon Building, was put up for sale in early November. 
Closely held Rockefeller Group is the Rockefeller family's investment arm. 

   The pact with Mitsui Fudosan, signed late Tuesday, was for considerably less than Exxon and Rockefeller Group hoped they would get for the property. 
Real estate industry sources said the two companies had expected to fetch more than $700 million for the building. 

   Bids were substantially lower because the building contains a lot of asbestos, the removal of which is expensive. 
The owners also were anxious to sell the property before year's end because the new tax law, effective Jan. 1, will impose a higher capital-gains rate. 

   Exxon will receive half the selling price. 
The oil company also will receive an amount that wasn't disclosed for giving up part of its current lease, which is below market value, on 76% of the building. 
Rockefeller Group will continue to manage the building for the next 10 years. 

   Other top bidders for the property included Shuwa Investment Co. and Fisher Brothers, a New York-based real estate concern. 
Shuwa, which recently bought the headquarters of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s American Broadcasting Cos. unit, had bid about $550 million and was widely expected to up the ante. 

   But industry sources said the family-owned Japanese concern, which has spent billions on U.S. real estate, dropped out of the competition last week. 

   Mitsui-Fudosan is paying about $270 a square foot for the building. 
Real estate appraisers estimate it will cost an additional $20 a square foot, or about $40 million, to clean out the asbestos. 

   That price is still well below the more than $500 a square foot that owners of other prime Manhattan properties have fetched recently from Japanese buyers. 
One Japanese concern recently purchased the Tiffany building in New York for $945 a square foot. 

   Many U.S. real estate investors have complained in recent months that the strength of the yen against the dollar has given Japanese buyers a major advantage in purchasing U.S. properties. 

   Some found the Exxon Building transaction sobering. 
"At about $300 a square foot, it's a bid U.S. buyers could compete with," said one real estate investor. 
"Now maybe prices the Japanese are paying will start to come down."
