PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese investors are expected to buy a large stake in France's Forum des 
Halles shopping center, a thriving new complex that is as much a part of the 
Paris cityscape as the Japanese-owned Rockefeller Center is to New York's 
skyline. 
</P>
<P>
France's Credit Lyonnais bank is about to clinch a deal to sell Nippon Life 
Insurance Co. nearly a third of the shopping center for $68 million, bank 
sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, a Nippon spokesman declined to comment on reports of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The Forum des Halles is a huge multistory complex in the heart of Paris near 
the Louvre. It is the largest and busiest shopping center in the French 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the deal, which would be Nippon's first investment in French 
real estate, would have to be approved by the Japanese Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
A controlling stake in Rockefeller Center, a New York landmark and a symbol of 
U.S. capitalism, was sold to Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co. for $846 million 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Nippon, a major life insurer, already has stakes in the French travel company 
Club Mediterranee and construction group Bouygues. 
</P>
<P>
France last March cleared the sale of one of its top cognac houses to a 
Japanese concern, part of a growing drive by the Japanese into the French 
luxury goods sector. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Paris restaurant Lucas-Carton, which has a prestigious three-star 
ranking in the Michelin gastronomic bible, and the jet-setters' hair salon 
Carita have been sold to Japanese interests.
