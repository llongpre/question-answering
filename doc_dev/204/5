<HEAD>Rockefeller Group Seeking Ways To Raise More Cash</HEAD>

   Rockefeller Group Inc. confirmed Monday it was
seeking ways to raise more cash for the family members who are
majority shareholders, after a published report indicated part of
the firm could be up for sale by month's end.
   The company's management has been authorized by the board of
directors ``to explore strategic alternatives for
recapitalization,'' said Vince Silvestri, a spokesman for
Rockefeller Group, whose vast holdings include the 19-building,
22-acre Rockefeller Center in Manhattan.
   But Silvestri said he couldn't comment on a report in Monday's
Wall Street Journal that said Rockefeller Group was trying to sell a
large stake in the family-owned company to outside investors for
more than $1 billion.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources familiar with the
proposal, said Rockefeller Group may seek between $1.3 billion and
$2 billion for 40 percent to 80 percent of the company. It said
family members were hoping to raise cash without losing control over
the management of company assets.
   The company is preparing a prospectus that will be available by
the end of the month to a limited group of potential investors,
according to the Journal.
   The plan would represent another step by Rockefeller Group to
raise cash for a generation of Rockefellers whose inheritance is
largely locked up in real estate and other corporate holdings.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space,
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real
estate investment trust. The company also sold a 15 percent equity
interest to outside investors and some properties around the country.
   ``Among those alternatives being considered are longer financial
restructuring, the sale of shares or a possible joint venture
arrangement with selected investors ...,'' said Silvestri.
   He said proceeds would be used in part ``to provide greater
liquidity for current shareholders.''
   The Rockefeller family fortune was built by John D. Rockefeller,
founder of Standard Oil Co., and was estimated at $900 million by
1911.
   His son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created a series of five trusts
for his children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal owners of
Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr. the
main beneficiaries.
   As the family now moves into the sixth generation the need for
cash to finance various business efforts has increased.
   Besides the Rockefeller Center complex, which includes the
General Electric Building, formerly known as the RCA building, Radio
City Music Hall and the Time-Life buildings, Rockefeller Group
operates several businesses.
   They include: Rockefeller Center Development Corp., Rockefeller
Center Management Corp., Rockefeller Group Telecommunications
Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall Productions Inc., and Cushman &amp;
Wakefield, in which the company holds an 80 percent stake.
