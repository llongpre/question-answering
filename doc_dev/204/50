   Benjamin Spencer, grandson of the late
philanthropist John D. Rockefeller III, committed suicide in a motel
room, a medical investigator said.
   Spencer, 24, left notes for his family and friends, and several
empty drug bottles were found in the room Thursday, police said.
   The cause of death appeared to be an overdose of prescription
drugs, said Dr. Kris Sperry, of the Office of the Medical
Investigator, who performed an autopsy Friday. Sperry added,
however, that test results were not yet available.
   Spencer's body was found by a housekeeper at the Howard Johnson
Plaza, police said.
   A neighbor who asked not to be identified said Spencer had
appeared unhappy recently.
   ``I knew him enough to say that this doesn't come as a complete
surprise,'' the neighbor said. ``I know he wasn't sleeping; he was
up at three or four in the morning. And when he would come down to
visit, even to get him to smile _ the easiest social things _ was
hard.''
   Spencer's mother, Hope Aldrich, is the daughter of Rockefeller,
who died in 1978. She lives in Santa Fe and publishes a weekly
newspaper.
   Besides his mother, Spencer is survived his father, John Spencer
of Vermont; and two brothers, David and Theo.
   Rockefeller was the grandson and namesake of the founder of the
Standard Oil Co.
