   Time Inc. said it sold its interest in its Rockefeller Center headquarters building to the Rockefeller family for $118 million. 

   The publishing and cable television concern said it sold its 45% interest in RockTime Inc., the joint venture that owns the Time &amp; Life Building, to Rockefeller Group Inc., the family investment company that owns the other 55%. 
A Time spokesman said the headquarters building is the largest part of the joint venture, which also owns other real estate and unspecified assets. 

   Time said the entire $118 million will be recorded as a pre-tax gain in the fourth quarter. 
In the 1985 fourth quarter, Time earned $51.4 million, or 81 cents a share, on revenue of $945.2 million. 
It said proceeds from the sale, which was expected, will be used for "general corporate purposes," including Time's plan, announced last June, to buy back as many as 10 million shares, or 16%, of its common stock outstanding. 

   The transaction indicates a price for the 48-story building that is far lower than some real estate sources expected. 
Some real estate executives had predicted the building could fetch $600 million. 
Earlier this month, Exxon Corp. and Rockefeller Group agreed to sell the nearby Exxon building for $610 million to Mitsui Fudosan (New York) Inc., a unit of Tokyo-based Mitsui Real Estate Development Co. 

   However, real estate sources noted that the two building sales aren't necessarily comparable because of variables such as rent levels. 
The Time spokesman said, "The difference is that this building is smaller and older, and our existing lease is below current market rates." 
He said that as a multiple of cash flow per square foot of building space, Time got a price comparable to what Exxon and Rockefeller Group received for the Exxon building. 

   The Time &amp; Life Building was constructed in 1959 at a cost of about $70 million. 
Time's current lease on the building expires in 1997. 
Time said it extended its lease for an additional 10 years and received an option to renew for another decade. 

   Communications analysts reacted favorably to the sale. 
"It's a more efficient use of resources. 
The timing is correct, to do this by the end of the year to get the old capital gains rate rather than the new (higher) capital gains rate," said John S. Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
"If you were ever thinking about it, it's a good time to do it." 

   "They're certainly better served having the money than having the deed to a building, and on that basis alone it sounded like a significant redeployment of assets," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc. 

   The Time spokesman said the sale "is part of Time Inc.'s restructuring program, which began several years ago. 
We are converting and concentrating our assets in our core businesses, which are magazines, books, and cable television." 

   Separately, Time said it completed its previously announced purchase of Scott, Foresman &amp; Co., an educational publisher, from SFN Cos., Glenview, Ill., for $520 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Time closed at $70 a share, down 12.5 cents.
