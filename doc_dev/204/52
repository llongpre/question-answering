   The Japanese will own 51 percent of the
Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center this winter, 51 percent of
Radio City Music Hall and 51 percent of the Art Deco skyscraper
where Tom Brokaw and David Letterman work.
   The $846 million investment in Rockefeller Group Inc. this past
week by Mitsubishi Estate Co. provoked a fresh spate of headlines
about how foreigners, Japanese in particular, were buying up
America.
   The headlines were understandable. The deal involved the first
family of American capitalism as well as a major tourist and media
center. It came a month after Sony Corp.'s agreement to buy another
cultural symbol, Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   What was often missed, though, is that while the Japanese are
buying in the United States, Americans are buying overseas as well.
A case in point is Ford Motor Co.'s agreement this past week to buy
the British luxury automaker Jaguar PLC for $2.5 billion.
   The Japanese have more capacity to invest abroad because of
their towering trade surpluses, but the Americans are making
certain not to lose out in the global acquisition game.
   Most U.S. overseas purchases scarcely make news. Few noticed
this past week when Totes Inc. of Ohio bought a West German
umbrella distributor and renamed it Totes Deutschland. Or when
International Business Machines Corp. bought one-fifth of a Dutch
software company, Delaware Computing, from its Belgian parent.
   But despite the lack of publicity back home, Americans were the
biggest cross-border buyer of companies in Europe in the first half
of 1989, according to British-American Deal Review.
   ``When Americans fear that their landmark real estate and their
top corporations are being consumed by foreign predators, they must
remember that at the very same time America is the largest acquirer
in Europe,'' said Mark Dixon, the review's editor.
   The truth is that companies in all the major industrialized
nations are investing overseas, hoping to establish beachheads in
each other's markets and transform themselves into global
competitors.
   Ford, for example, already is much more entrenched in Europe
than Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. or Toyota Motor Corp. is in the United
States. IBM is so well planted in foreign markets that it is
perceived as a local company.
   ``This is not something that started today or this week or last
week. The most dynamic element of international economic
transactions over the past decade or two decades has been foreign
direct investment,'' said Peter Hansen, executive director of the
United Nations' Center on Transnational Corporations.
   The foreign investment that some Americans fear is a problem
that most Third World nations would love to have. They can't get
foreign money to build essential factories, roads and bridges.
   Flows of direct foreign investment ``are concentrated in
developed countries more than ever before,'' the United Nations
center said in a report earlier this year.
   As cross-border investment continues to grow in the 1990s,
nations will pay more attention to whether the investment they get
is productive or unproductive. Unfortunately, channeling foreign
money to desirable recipients won't be easy.
   ``It doesn't really work, because companies, even in sectors
which are being welcomed and encouraged, are frightened that the
winds will change and they'll be put on the blacklist,'' said
Dixon, the editor of British-American Deal Review.
   Maybe so. In any case, the level of debate over cross-border
investment is bound to get more sophisticated. People will worry
less about who owns Christmas trees and music halls, and more about
what improves the national welfare.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Senate Republicans effectively abandoned efforts to win a
capital-gains tax cut this year. It was a victory for the Democrats
and a defeat for President Bush, who just weeks ago seemed on the
verge of meeting a tax-cut promise that had been part of his
campaign for the presidency.
   _The New York Stock Exchange announced fresh limits on
computerized program trading in response to a wave of complaints
that the strategy contributes to wild swings in stock prices.
Several major brokerage firms announced voluntary limits on the use
of program trading for themselves and customers.
   _Georgia-Pacific Corp. offered $3.3 billion for another paper
company, Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., in the first major takeover
offer since the collapse of a $6.75 billion bid for UAL Corp. by
employees and management. Separately, an investment group led by
Coniston Partners said it would attempt to take over the UAL board
of directors to force a sale or restructuring of the company.
