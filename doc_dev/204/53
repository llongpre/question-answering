Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, yesterday agreed to refinance part of
the debt of Rockefeller Centre Properties in a move which could also give it
a large equity stake in the company.
Rockefeller Centre Properties is an investment company set up to own the
Dollars 1.3bn mortgage on the landmark New York development, which is 80 per
cent owned by Mitsubishi Estate of Japan.
The Goldman Sachs move could leave it with an influential voice in any
future financial reorganisation of the mid-town office and retail
development.
RCP recently disclosed in a regulatory filing that Mitsubishi may fail to
meet interest payments on the mortgage, the next of which is due in
February.
Goldman and Whitehall Street Real Estate, a private investment vehicle
managed by the bank, have agreed to buy Dollars 225m of debt from RCP. It
has also been granted warrants and stock appreciation rights which, if
exercised fully, would give Goldman and Whitehall 19.9 per cent of the
shares in RCP.
However, the company's bye-laws may have to be amended before they could
take up this interest.
At present, they restrict any individual holding to a maximum of 9.8 per
cent.
RCP said the deal with Goldman refinanced debt which otherwise would have
fallen due next June.
