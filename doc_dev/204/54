   U.S. Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV
breezed to a primary victory, while the governor's former wife, Dee
Caperton, lost a chance to become state treasurer.
   ``I've won folks, how about that!'' Rockefeller told about 50
supporters at his campaign headquarters Tuesday night.
   Rockefeller, heir to one of America's largest fortunes, had
198,759 votes, or 84 percent, with all precincts reporting. He was
followed by inventor Ken Thompson, with 21,961 votes, or 9 percent,
and conceptual artist Paul Nuchims, with 14,508 votes, or 6
percent, in a race that was never expected to be competitive.
   ``I don't think that people know that much about what I've been
doing,'' said Rockefeller, a Democrat seeking a second term. ``I
look at the campaign as a creative way to show what I've
accomplished.''
   The Republican Senate nominee is John Yoder, 39, a former aide
to retired Chief Justice Warren Burger. Yoder had no opposition.
   In the treasurer's race, former Treasurer Larrie Bailey defeated
Ms. Caperton, 47, a former legislator and the former wife of Gov.
Gaston Caperton. With all precincts reporting, Bailey had 89,627
votes, or 38 percent, to 74,950 votes, or 32 percent, for Ms.
Caperton.
   The rest of the votes in the Democratic primary were divided
among Marie Prezioso, a Charleston investment banker, and Eugene
Knotts, a county assessor.
   Ms. Caperton, a former Miss West Virginia and runner-up in the
Miss America pageant, spent more than $240,000 on her primary
campaign, nearly 40 times the $6,169 spent by Bailey.
   The lone GOP candidate for treasurer was Elvin F. Martin, a
certified public accountant.
