   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV sought
nomination to a second term Tuesday, and former first lady Dee
Caperton competed in a Democratic primary for state treasurer.
   Also on the Democratic ballot was a comeback effort by Ken
Hechler, the secretary of state who sought his old congressional
job back. He challenged Rep. Nick Joe Rahall.
   In the Senate race, Democrats Paul Nuchims and Ken Thompson were
attempting to unseat Rockefeller, heir to one of America's largest
fortunes.
   Ms. Caperton, 47, the former wife of Gov. Gaston Caperton, ran
against Larrie Bailey, a former treasurer, Marie Prezioso, a
Charleston investment banker and one of Bailey's former employees,
and Eugene Knotts, a Wood County assessor.

   Nuchims, who bills himself as a ``conceptual artist,'' spent
less than $500 on his campaign. Thompson proved elusive to
reporters during the campaign.
   The Republican Senate nominee is John Yoder, 39, a Harpers Ferry
lawyer and former aide to retired Chief Supreme Court Justice
Warren Berger.
   Ms. Caperton, a former beauty queen, said she was qualified to
run the state's finances and pointed to her management of her own
$5 million portfolio in addition to an estimated $11 million she
reportedly received from her divorce settlement with the governor
last fall.
   The new treasurer will finish the final two years of former
Treasurer A. James Manchin's term. Manchin resigned last July to
avoid a Senate trial after being impeached for his part in losses
to the state investment fund. The governor appointed state Sen.
Thomas Loehr as treasurer, but Loehr decided not to run for the job.
   The lone GOP candidate for treasurer is Elvin F. Martin, a
certified public accountant.
   Hechler, 75, was making his third bid to recapture the U.S.
House seat he gave up in 1976 after 18 years in a failed
gubernatorial bid against Rockefeller.
