   Early American folk art collected by Abby
Aldrich Rockefeller, who delighted in discovering the work of
untrained and unrecognized artistic talent, goes on display today
at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art.
   The 182 objects in the exhibit includes portraits, landscapes,
trade and shop signs, weathervanes, whirligigs, toys, pottery,
furniture, quilts and carved figures, most of them produced in the
18th and 19th centuries.
   They are some of the finest works from the collection of more
than 2,600 objects at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center,
which opened in 1957 at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Many
objects in the touring exhibition have not been seen outside
Williamsburg for decades.
   The nucleus of that museum, which claims the finest public
collection of American folk art in the world, were the 420 works
bequeathed by the wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr., a founder of the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, who began buying the works of
early, untrained American artists in the 1920s.
   Many of the works were created by craftsmen or self-taught
artists like Wilhelm Schimmel, a vagrant from Pennsylvania's
Cumberland Valley who carved small animals and birds in exchange
for food and drink, and John Brewster Jr., a deaf-mute who earned a
living painting portraits such as ``Boy With a Finch,'' which has
become an icon of American folk art.
   Among the most popular paintings in the show is ``Baby in Red
Chair,'' the familiar image of a smiling, sleeping baby in a high
chair, produced by an unknown early 19th century artist, probably
from Pennsylvania.
   Other pictures are by such widely known early American artists
as Edward Hicks, Erastus Salisbury Field and Ammi Phillips. Four
20th century objects in the exhibit signify the Rockefeller
museum's growing interest in contemporary folk art.
   The Rockefeller exhibit, whose national tour began in New York
last January, will remain at National Museum of American Art
through Feb. 19, and then will travel to museums in San Francisco,
Dallas and Tulsa, Okla.
