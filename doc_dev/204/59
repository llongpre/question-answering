<HEAD>Senate Candidate Cautioned By Medical Board, Alleges GOP `Dirty
Trick'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentucky's medical licensure board chided
Dr. Harvey Sloane, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, for
writing prescriptions with an expired federal drug registration.
   But the board said Thursday no formal sanction was warranted.
Sloane said the inquiry into his writing prescription refills for
himself was ``a carefully orchestrated ... Republican dirty
trick.''
   A spokesman for Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell accused Sloane
of ``outrageous lies.''
   It was the second inquiry by the state Board of Medical
Licensure into Sloane's prescriptions.
   Last fall, the board advised Sloane to stop prescribing sleeping
pills for himself. Sloane, who no longer has an active medical
practice, said he wrote refills of the pills because of arthritis
pain in his hip and back pain from a degenerative disk disease. He
did not write the original prescriptions.
   The inquiry was prompted by the disclosure that Sloane's Drug
Enforcement Administration permit to write prescriptions had
expired in February 1987.

   A judge denied an heir to the du Pont
fortune the $300,000 he requested from a trust to finance his
independent campaign for Congress.
   Thursday's denial by Anthony R. Appel, a Lancaster County judge
assigned to the case by the state Supreme Court, marks the second
such failure this week for Lewis du Pont Smith.
   Smith, 33, a follower of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, is
running against Republican Rep. Richard Schulze, aneight-term
incumbent, and Democrat Sam Stretton, a West Chester attorney.

<HEAD>Exon's Wife Says Drinking Allegations Have Hurt Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Jim Exon's wife says allegations that
her husband has a drinking problem have caused her family
considerable pain.
   ``It's hard on our children to hear things about their father
that they know aren't true,'' Pat Exon said at a fund-raising event
here for her husband, a two-term Democratic senator who is seeking
a third term against Republican Hal Daub.
   Mrs. Exon was referring to allegations former Sen. John Tower
made that Exon had a reputation as one of the heaviest drinkers in
the Senate. Tower made the comments during a campaign stop for Daub
in Nebraska last week.

<HEAD>Wilson Criticized For Campaign Contributions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists called Republican
gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson ``Pesticide Pete'' for
accepting $80,909 in campaign money from the pesticide industry.
   Wilson's campaign said the environmentalists were engaging in
smear tactics.
   The National Toxics Campaign said Wilson ranked third in the
U.S. Senate among recipients of pesticide industry contributions
between 1983 and 1988. The organization said Wilson ranked behind
Sen. Steve Simms, R-Idaho, and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   ``We had been wondering why Pete Wilson decided to oppose `Big
Green' (environmental initiative Proposition 128), and now we've
finally got an answer that makes sense,'' said Sierra Club member
Bob Hattoy.
   Wilson spokesman Otto Bos accused the National Toxics Campaign
of a ``big lie.'' He said Wilson was ranked ``third-best Republican
in the entire U.S. Senate on the environment by the national League
of Conservation Voters.... The voters are much smarter than to fall
for the `big lie,''' Bos said.
   He did not dispute, however, that Wilson received the
contributions.
