   Rockefeller Group Inc. is seeking to sell a major stake in the family-owned company to outside investors for more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with the proposed transaction. 

   Sources said the company, which owns Rockefeller Center in Manhattan among other assets, is seeking between $1.3 billion and $2 billion. 
Various proposals that have been discussed would involve the sale of from 40% to 80% of the company, the sources said. 

   The plan represents another in a series of moves to raise cash for a generation of Rockefellers whose inheritance is tied up in real estate and other corporate holdings. 

   Rockefeller Group's investment banker, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., is preparing a prospectus which will be available by the end of this month to a limited group of potential investors, people close to the transaction said. 
Family members are hoping to be able to raise the cash without losing control over the management of company assets, the sources said. 

   Richard A. Voell, Rockefeller Group's president said: "The board has authorized us to explore different strategic alternatives or a recapitalization of the company." 
He said the alternatives include a long-term financial restructuring of the company or a sale of shares. 

   Mr. Voell said the goal of any such transaction would be to raise more capital for the company and provide liquidity for current shareholders. 
He said the investor or buyer must "share the long-term interests of the company." 

   Japanese firms and institutional investors who are aware of the offer are said to be interested already, in large part because Rockefeller Group's real-estate portfolio includes the "trophy" properties such investors crave. 

   Built during the Great Depression, the core of Rockefeller Center is known for its Art Deco-style buildings which overlook a famous ice-skating rink, a Christmas tree in the winter and a gilded statue of Prometheus. 
The center includes 30 Rockefeller Plaza (formerly the RCA building, now the General Electric Building), where National Broadcasting Co. is a major tenant. 
In addition, there are more modern structures, including the Time-Life and McGraw-Hill buildings. 

   In addition to Rockefeller Center, the company's assets include 80% of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the national real-estate brokerage and consulting firm; Rockefeller Center Development Corp., which controls prime New York and New Jersey properties; Radio City Music Hall Productions Inc.; Rockefeller Center Telecommunications Services; and a financial-services unit. 

   Among recent moves to raise cash for the Rockefeller family, Rockefeller Group refinanced the 19-building Rockefeller Center in 1985 by taking out a $1.3 billion mortgage on some of the rentable space and then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real-estate investment trust. 

   The publicly held REIT has an option to convert its mortgage to a 71% ownership stake in the mortgaged property by the year 2000. 
The mortgage held by the REIT applies to six million of the 15 million square feet of rentable space in Rockefeller Center. 

   Also in 1985, Rockefeller Group sold a 15% equity interest to outside investors. 
More recently, it sold properties around the country. 

   The company's Rockefeller Center Development Corp. unit manages and operates the 22-acre center, and sources familiar with the latest plan said the company wants to continue to manage the complex because of the center's link to the Rockefeller family name and image. 

   The sources said the company may seek a group of investors who together would control a majority stake in the company, but who individually would own less than any member of the Rockefeller family. 

   But sources said this time it may not be easy to find investors willing to comply with Rockefeller Group's stipulations that the real-estate, entertainment and communications businesses remain under one umbrella. 

   The company also controls a vacant midtown Manhattan site on the west side of the center where a proposed skyscraper may be built. 
The development unit also controls a 678-acre site in Mount Olive, N.J., about half of which is slated for office development. 

   The Rockefeller family fortune was built by John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil Co., who amassed by 1911 a fortune of $900 million, the equivalent of many billions in today's dollars. 
His son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created a series of five trusts for his children in 1934, funding each with about $50 million. 
Today, the trusts are the principal owner of Rockefeller Group, and the descendants of John D. Jr. are the beneficiaries. 
As the descendants proliferate, the family pie is being sliced into more and more pieces. 
Many of the fourth generation are middle-aged and saddled by financial obligations. 
And even some of the fifth generation are in their 30s and eager for cash to finance their business efforts.
