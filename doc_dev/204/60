   A 30-year-old grandson of James S. Rockefeller
left Fiji Monday night, apparently after being bitten on a leg by a
shark while swimming at an exclusive island resort.
   The Fiji Times newspaper said Ola Stillman Rockefeller was
injured on Saturday soon after he arrived at Laucala Island, about
120 miles northeast of Fiji's capital, Suva.
   The isolated resort is owned by the estate of the late American
billionaire Malcolm Forbes.
   Rockefeller, a bachelor, told the newspaper he had been swimming
alone in waist-deep water about 30 yards offshore when he felt his
right leg being ``pulled.''
   Looking down, he said he saw it had been lacerated, apparently
by two bites from a shark.
   He said he managed to swim to shore and crawl to his bungalow
where he telephoned for help.
   Resort workers applied first-aid before a nurse from a village
health clinic could assist. A doctor from a nearby hospital was
brought in by boat several hours later.
   On arrival, Dr. Viliame Taoi said he found Rockefeller in stable
condition, but he ``appeared to have lost some blood.'' His
Achilles tendon had been lacerated and required stiches.
   At dawn Sunday, Rockefeller was flown by the Forbes' private
plane to a hospital in Lautoka, Fiji's second-largest city.
   He left Fiji on an overnight flight to the United States
accompanied by a medical team from Australia and with his right
ankle in a plaster cast.
   ``I have not been discouraged by the experience,'' he was quoted
as telling The Fiji Times newspaper before departing.
   Rockefeller is the grandson of James S. Rockefeller, who was a
chairman of the City Bank of New York, which became Citibank.
   Michael Rockefeller, son of then-New York Gov. Nelson D.
Rockfeller, vanished in November 1961, off Irian Jaya, an
Indonesian territory that shares its island border with Papua New
Guinea.
   Michael, then 23, disappeared while swimming from his capsized
catamaran in shark-infested waters. The island of Irian Jaya and
Papua New Guinea is about 1,000 miles west of Fiji.
