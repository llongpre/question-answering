   Architect I.M. Pei and painters Willem De Kooning
and David Hockney were among the first six winners of the Praemium
Imperiale, a new award from Japan that a leading philanthropist
compared to Nobel prizes.
   The other winners of the honor, which comes with $100,000, were
Italian sculptor Umberto Mastroianni, film director Marcel Carne and
conductor Pierre Boulez, both of France.
   ``These prizes will come to be perceived as a supplement to the
Nobel Prize and will soon assume in the arts the stature of the
Nobel awards in other fields,'' said David Rockefeller, former
chairman and chief executive officer of Chase Manhattan Bank,
chairman of the Museum of Modern Art and a member of an advisory
panel for the awards.
   Prince Masahito Hitachi, brother of the emperor and governor of
the Japan Art Association, which gives the awards, will present them
in Tokyo on Oct. 27.
   A luncheon to announce the winners was attended by Pei, a
naturalized U.S. citizen born in China, and Lisa De Kooning,
daughter of the painter, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Holland.
   ``I'm numb and I really don't know what to think or how to
feel,'' said Pei. ``It has to be `the' award, as far as I'm
concerned. ... But it does put a lot of burden on those of us who
are nominated.''
   Seiji Tanaka, Japan Art Association coordinator, said about 50 or
60 nominations were received.
   Tanaka said it was coincidental that all the winners are male and
American or European. In addition, he said, the award categories may
be changed next year _ to make theater and film separate categories,
for instance.
   The prize is funded primarily by Fujisankei Communications
International, a media corporation. Fujisankei founder Nobutaka
Shikanai is chairman of the Japan Art Association, founded in the
19th Century.
   The association selected the winners based on recommendations
from the International Committee of Advisers, which included
Rockefeller, former prime ministers Jacques Chirac of France, Edward
Heath of Britain and Amintore Fanfani of Italy and former West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
   Each adviser had his own method of coming up with nominations,
said Ned Steele, a publicist for the event.
   In the United States, Rockefeller asked Schuyler Chapin, former
dean of the Columbia University School of Arts, to recruit a
committee to give him recommendations. That committee included
Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim, New York Times art critic John
Russell, Yale Drama School Dean Lloyd Richards, former Smithsonian
Secretary S. Dillon Ripley and former CBS President Frank Stanton.
