<LEADPARA>  BAILEY, Richard E., 80, a pioneer in television sports broadcasting; Friday at
a Holmdel, N.J., hospital. Mr. Bailey, who worked for United Press
International and ABC, conceived a way to effectively and economically
broadcast a consistent schedule of away games for major league baseball. He
developed Sports Network Incorporated (SNI), which in 1955 began broadcasting
baseball road games to teams' home cities. Later, SNI began televising games
using its own production facilities and acquired the rights to broadcast many
professional and collegiate sports. Network affiliates pre-empted their
programs to carry the telecasts.;   BURNETT, John G., 67, former head of the
