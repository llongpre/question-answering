   Sharon Percy Rockefeller was named Monday as
president-chief executive officer of WETA-TV-FM, one of the
nation's flagship public television stations, the station announced.
   Mrs. Rockefeller, 44, will succeed Ward B. Chamberlin Jr., who
is stepping down Dec. 1 after 15 years as president of WETA, the
third-largest production center for the Public Broadcasting Service.
   Mrs. Rockefeller was the unanimous choice of an 11-member search
committee that she headed when it was established in March. She
resigned from the committee after she decided to toss her hat in
the ring.
   Chamberlin said the station found ``the best possible choice in
our own back yard.''
   Mrs. Rockefeller, a Democrat and cum laude graduate of Stanford
University, is a former chairwoman of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. She is married to Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV,
D-W.Va., and is the daughter of former Republican Sen. Charles
Percy of Illinois.
   She serves on the boards of Pepsico, PBS, Stanford University,
the University of Chicago and the National Women's Political Caucus.
   Her political connections are seen as making her a powerful
fund-raiser for WETA, which produces ``The MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' in association with WNET, New York, and MacNeil-Lehrer
Productions, ``Washington Week in Review,'' ``In Performance at the
White House'' and ``Smithsonian World.''
