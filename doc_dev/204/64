   Japanese purchases of U.S. real estate fell
10.7 percent in 1989, with investment shifting from office
buildings to hotels and resort properties, a report Monday said.
   Japanese spent $14.8 billion on U.S. real estate last year,
compared with $16.5 billion in 1988, according to a study by the
real estate accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.
   Purchases of office properties fell about 60 percent to $3.33
billion in 1989 from $8.31 billion the previous year. Investment in
hotel-resort properties rose to $4.16 billion last year from $3.58
billion in 1988, a 16 percent increase.
   Overall, offices remain the favorite target of Japanese
investors, said Jack Barthell, a Leventhal partner. Of the total
$57.7 billion that the firm's computer data base shows as invested
in U.S. real estate, 44 percent is in offices.
   Japanese appear to be backing away from purchases of ``trophy
properties'' such as Rockefeller Center, the study found.
Mitsubishi Estate Co. last year announced it was spending $846
million for a controlling interest in the company that owns
Rockefeller Center, the Manhattan office and cultural complex.
   The study also noted that despite publicity generated by such
purchases, Japanese still own just 2 percent of U.S. commercial
real estate, far less than European investors.
   California was the leading state for the second year in a row,
with 36 percent of the 1989 investment. Forty percent of the
purchases were concentrated in the greater Los Angeles area.
   Hawaii was second and New York third, but interest among
Japanese buyers in properties there appears to be waning.
   ``Most of the attractive properties have already been acquired,
and the cost of acquisitions in Manhattan may cause investors to
divert funds to other markets,'' Barthell said.
   The top three states accounted for 81 percent of the Japanese
investment.
   Among other findings, investment in residential property jumped
to 15 percent, triple the amount invested in 1988. Nearly
two-thirds of that was in California and 28 percent in Hawaii.
   Leventhal said the size of Japanese deals is getting smaller as
investment moves into smaller American cities, and that Japan's
largest institutional investors are turning attention to Europe
leading up to economic unification in 1992.
   Leventhal defines investment as both equity investment and
convertible debt secured by U.S. real estate.
