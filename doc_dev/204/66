<LEADPARA>  AMONG THE band of little-known Democrats scouting the unfriendly presidential
landscape for 1992, one stands out, literally and figuratively -- Sen. John D.
Rockefeller IV.;    The 6-foot, 6 1/2-inch Rockefeller, great-grandson of the
founder of the fabled oil dynasty, is touring New Hampshire and Iowa, the
opening battlegrounds for the Democratic nomination, trying to find out if he
has the stuff to challenge President Bush.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "In Iowa," he said, "they told me the good news is that I have 100 percent
name identification. The bad news is that one-third of the people think I'm
the banker who foreclosed on their farm, one-third think I run the oil company
that raised the price of gasoline and one-third think I'm the guy who sold
Manhattan to the Japanese.";    In New Hampshire, Rockefeller, who is known as
Jay, quipped that he grew up in New York like a normal boy playing with blocks
-- "you know, 48th Street, 49th Street.";    Jokes about his famous name and
wealth help cushion the awkwardness of Rockefeller's exploratory campaign.
Although he has been in politics for 25 of his 53 years -- including eight
years as governor of West Virginia and seven as senator from his adopted state
-- New Hampshire Democrats who turned out to look him over last weekend found
him not quite ready for the big time.;    "He hasn't disciplined his message,"
former Democratic state Chairman Joseph Grandmaison said after listening to
Rockefeller respond to questions with long, rambling answers that sometimes
baffled his audiences. "He communicates best on who he is and what he stands
for, but he doesn't frame his policy message well.";    Robert E. Craig, a
political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said
Rockefeller has "tremendous stature, physically and intellectually, but he
hasn't got his presidential act together.";    In an interview, Rockefeller
acknowledged that he is a raw beginner in presidential politics with a lot to
learn. He didn't decide to explore a race until the beginning of May, so
"think of me as only 2 or 3 weeks old," he said with a smile.;    Despite the
jokes, a Rockefeller candidacy would not be a lighthearted ego trip by a rich
playboy.;    The lanky senator with the horn-rimmed glasses started out in
life to be a scholar in Far Eastern languages. Now he is a serious student of
difficult problems much closer to voters' concerns -- their health and their
children -- and a passionate advocate of federal action to meet their needs.; 
  Thursday, after two years as chairman of the Pepper Commission, he released
its recommendations for a fundamental overhaul of the U.S. health-care
system.;    As chairman of the National Commission on Children, he is
preparing a program, to be made public in June, to help poor or troubled
children.;    Dan McGinn, a friend of 20 years, said Rockefeller never talked,
even in private, about the White House until last fall, after his re-election
to the Senate. At that point, McGinn said, Rockefeller began to think that
running for president might increase his visibility and help advance his
programs.;    WHAT FINALLY made up his mind, Rockefeller said, was his
mounting anger and frustration at the Reagan-Bush administrations' failure to
do more to meet the nation's domestic needs.;    "I've had it with 11 years of
Reagan and Bush. I've just had it," he said.;    "I can understand Reagan --
he was never really in it. But Bush is different. He's smart, intellectually
active. He knows how the system works. But everything comes back 'no' from the
White House. . . . I'm tired of 'no, no, no.' ";    Rockefeller, who has four
children, ages 21, 19, 18 and 11, said he owes a special debt to kids.;   
After Asian studies at Harvard and Yale and in Tokyo, as well as two years
with the Peace Corps in the Philippines, he decided that he knew nothing about
his own country. So in 1964 he joined Volunteers in Service to America, a
domestic anti-poverty program, and was assigned to Emmons, an impoverished
community of 56 families in West Virginia's coal country.;    "It was classic
Appalachia," he said. "I couldn't break in. I'd come to a door, and say, 'What
can we do together?' and the door would close. I was an outsider. I was
rejected. . . .;    "One day I sat down on the railroad tracks and started
pitching stones. Kids came over to me. We pitched stones. I talked to the
kids. I got into their houses. They allowed me to break through from being an
outsider. They were my troops. That's when my VISTA work began. It turned my
life around.";    After two years in the program, Rockefeller decided to stay
in West Virginia and enter public life as a Democrat, unlike his uncles Nelson
and Winthrop, the Republican governors of New York and Arkansas.;    "Eighty
percent of my generation of Rockefellers are Democrats -- hard-core
Democrats," he said.;    He was elected governor in 1976 and re-elected in
1980. Barred by law from seeking a third term, he ran for a vacant Senate seat
in 1984 and won narrowly.;    DURING HIS first six years in the Senate,
Rockefeller concentrated on West Virginia concerns and shunned the national
limelight.;    But after his re-election last fall and with the ripening of
his work on the Pepper and Children's commissions, Rockefeller decided the
time had come to move out of the shadows.;    Rockefeller said he has already
moved past the point of running merely to advance his agenda and would like
very much to be president.;    "Could I be as good a president as Bush?" he
asked rhetorically. "I could be a better one."  </TEXT>
