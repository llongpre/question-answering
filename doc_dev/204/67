   Government and the automotive industry must
intensify efforts to find new ways of fueling the nation's vehicles
if an oil crisis is to be averted in the 1990s, Sen. John D.
Rockefeller IV said Tuesday.
   ``We need to think systematically about what must be done by the
end of the next decade to displace millions of barrels a day of
imported oil with alternative fuels,'' the West Virginia Democrat
told the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   ``It is time for us to get on with the job of making the United
States energy secure again.''
   Rockefeller's remarks came at the opening of the society's
three-day conference on technical and regulatory issues facing the
automotive industry, including fuel economy, safety and alternative
fuels.
   The major U.S. automakers have built prototypes of cars using
alcohol-based fuels. However, efforts to promote such vehicles as
commercial products have been constrained by relatively cheap oil
prices during much of the 1980s and the lack of a national
distribution network for fuels other than gasoline.
   ``The assumption that we can become dependent on imported oil
because it is now cheap will become a very expensive assumption in
the long run. It does not take much imagination to envision an
energy crisis in the 1990s,'' Rockefeller said.
   Rockefeller said the government must avoid a narrow focus in
making automotive policy.
   ``We cannot assume that all the world's problems can be solved
just by regulating ... the automobile,'' Rockefeller said.
   Rockefeller said the Senate energy subcommittee on research and
development would hold hearings in June aimed at finding ways to
encourage the replacement of gasoline with alternative fuels, such
as methanol, ethanol and natural gas.
