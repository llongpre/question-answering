   Thornton F. Bradshaw, chairman of RCA Corp. from
1981 to 1986, died Tuesday night from a cerebral hemorrhage,
according to Thomas B. Ross, senior vice president of NBC News. He
was 71.
   Bradshaw suffered a cerebral hemorrhage Monday morning and died
at about 6:30 p.m. EST Tuesday at New York Hospital, said Ross, who
formerly was senior vice president of corporate affairs at RCA.
   Bradshaw retired from RCA following its merger into General
Electric Co.
   He was active until his death as chairman of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the philanthropy that makes
so-called ``genius grants,'' large no-strings awards of money to
encourage talented individuals to work on projects free of financial
pressures.
   Bradshaw spent most of his business career with Atlantic
Richfield Corp., joining the oil company in 1956, when it was
Atlantic Refining Co., and rising to president in 1964.
   He was named to the board of directors of RCA in 1972 and moved
over from Atlantic Richfield in 1981 to become the seventh chairman
in the history of the broadcast and electronics corporation.
   Bradshaw was born in Washington, D.C., and educated at Exeter
Academy and at Harvard, from which he received three degrees and on
whose board of overseers he served from 1978 to 1984.
   He served in the Navy in World War II, earning seven battle stars
before being discharged in 1945 as a lieutenant junior grade.
   He taught at Harvard Business School following the war, then
worked for Cresap, McCormick &amp; Paget, a management consultant, from
1952 to 1956.
   After retiring from RCA, Bradshaw remained on the boards of
Atlantic Richfield and General Electric and also the boards of First
Boston Inc. and Brooks Fashion Stores Inc., the Japan Society and
the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
   He also chaired the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and
the Lauder Institute of Management and International Studies and was
a trustee of Claremont University Center and the Institute of
Advanced Study at Princeton University, and a member of the council
of Rockefeller University.
   He is survived by his wife, Patricia Salter West, and by
Priscilla Page of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; Nancy Poor of Norwell, Mass.; and
Jonathan Bradshaw of Newbury Park, Calif., the children of his
24-year first marriage that ended in divorce in 1964.
   A memorial service will be held Saturday morning at St. James
Episcopal Church at 865 Madison Ave.
