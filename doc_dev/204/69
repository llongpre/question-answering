  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Visiting U.S. Sen. John 
Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia, on Tuesday [11 
January] urged Japan to take concrete steps to ensure that 
Japan's chronic trade surpus with the United States is whittled 
down in coming years. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said Rockefeller, a veteran 
member 
of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, 
made the request in a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Rockefeller pointed to the importance of the upcoming summit 
between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa slated for February 11 for alleviating any irritants 
between the two countries, they said. 
  In reply, Hata said Japan recognized the "need to bolster 
the 
transparency" of bidding procedures for the construction market, 
to which the Clinton administration has been demanding greater 
access for American contractors, they said. 
  The minister also pointed out that Japan's plan to proceed 
with deregulation, loosening various curbs binding the hands of 
Japanese businesses and society will help improve the relations 
with the United States. 
  Rockefeller, a Harvard graduate who studied at International 
Christian University in Tokyo from 1957 to 1960, is noted for 
his familiarity with Japanese political affairs.
