   It was a super birthday party.
   But what else would you expect? The guest of honor was Superman
himself, joined by Wonder Woman, Luke Skywalker, and Rocky and
Bullwinkle.
   The four-day International Superman Exposition is expected to
draw up to 30,000 visitors before it ends Sunday.
   While the Man of Steel arrived on Earth from Krypton, his
birthplace is actually Cleveland. Superman was created by Cleveland
high school students Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and the first
Superman comic book appeared in June 1938.
   Superhero devotees have come to browse through comic books,
watch science fiction movies, and shop for memorabilia, including
rare Superman prints, said Tim Gorman of Neverending Battle Inc., a
non-profit organization founded to honor Siegel and Shuster and
sponsoring the symposium.
   On Thursday, Gorman unveiled a 2-foot-high shining steel model
of Superman in flight, right fist thrust high in a familiar pose.
The organization plans to raise enough money to build a larger
statue and a museum in Cleveland.

   A midwife-paramedic rushed in ``like the
cavalry'' to save the day for U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles' seventh
grandchild, unexpectedly born at home in breech position, said the
frightened father.
   Ed Chiles said there wasn't time to rush wife Anne to the
hospital Thursday, so he called help to their Holmes Beach home.
   But Kristin Anne was born feet first, and paramedics couldn't
get her head out and had to call for more help. Paramedic Doreen
Virginiak, one of only three registered midwives in the area,
showed up.
   ``It was like the cavalry came when she got here,'' Ed Chiles
said. ``We proceeded to have a miracle.''
   Within 10 minutes, the baby was delivered.
   ``She was lethargic and wasn't breathing,'' said Ms. Virginiak,
who massaged the baby into breathing.
   ``I was pretty frightened,'' the new father said hours later.
``Now it looks like we're going to have a nice baby girl.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., announced the birth during a Senate
Appropriations Committee meeting in Washington.
   ``He probably got the strongest applause that he's gotten since
he came to the Senate,'' said Jack Pridgen, an aide to the senior
Chiles, D-Fla.

   Award-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr.
says starring roles are nice, but they're not everything.
   ``Sometimes actors confine themselves to just the lead role,''
he said. ``I promised myself never to get an egotistical attitude
on the parts I choose, and instead I look at the role, whether it
is a lead role or a cameo.''
   Gossett is in Jonesborough this month for filming of ``Goodbye,
Miss Liberty,'' a movie for cable television's Disney Channel about
a Greek family who encounters prejudice in the early 1900s.
   Gossett won an Emmy for his portrayal of Fiddler in the
television miniseries ``Roots'' and an Academy Award for his role
as a tough drill instructor in ``An Officer and a Gentleman.''

   Bruce Babbitt attended Georgetown
University ``in spirit,'' and the school says that's enough to
entitle the former Arizona governor to its Bicentennial Medal.
   The Washington, D.C., university said Babbitt inherited the
school's virtues from his father, a Georgetown alumnus.
   The award was presented to Babbitt Wednesday at a meeting of
Georgetown alumni in Phoenix. Three Phoenix-area descendants of
Georgetown founder, Archbishop John Carroll, also received the
medals marking the university's 200th anniversary.

   Mike Mansfield received the first Nelson A.
Rockefeller Public Service Award but he was apparently too busy
serving the public as U.S. ambassador to Japan to pick up the award.
   Mansfield, 85, accepted the award via satellite from Tokyo,
where he has been posted since 1977.
   The festivities went on without him with more than 1,000 people
gathering for the awards dinner in New York.
   With Nelson Rockefeller's widow, Happy, sitting nearby, Gov.
Mario Cuomo saluted his predecessor as ``the quintessential New
Yorker.''
   The dinner benefited the Nelson Rockefeller Institute of
Government of the State University of New York.
