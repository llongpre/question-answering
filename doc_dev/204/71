   The landmark RCA Building _ a 70-story art deco
tower at the heart of Rockefeller Center _ is being renamed the GE
Building after the company that bought RCA and its network TV
division, NBC, two years ago.
   NBC President Robert Wright announced the decision in a memo to
employees Wednesday.
   ``It seems sort of the obvious evolution of things,'' said NBC
spokeswoman Betty Hudson.
   The RCA Building is a popular tourist spot for its swank Rainbow
Room restaurant, observation deck and NBC studios, where ``The
Today Show,'' ``Saturday Night Live,'' and ``Late Night With David
Letterman'' are taped.
   The building is owned by Rockefeller Center, but General
Electric has the right to change the name it's had for more than
five decades.
   Five blocks away is another landmark known as the General
Electric Building. It was once known as the RCA Victor Building
before GE moved in in 1933.
