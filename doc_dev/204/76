In sharp contrast to the current pessimism among U.S. real estate executives, 
Japanese companies are bullish about the 1990 outlook for property investments, 
especially in the Southern California region, according to a new survey. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese firms expect to increase their real estate investment in 1990 from 
1989 in certain regions of the United States, but some plan to scale back in 
the Southwest, according to the survey of 200 executives of Japanese 
subsidiaries and branch offices in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The survey is the first indication of spending plans by Japanese companies. "I 
was surprised on how bullish the Japanese were," said Christopher Mead, 
president of Mead Ventures Inc. His Phoenix firm, which publishes several 
newsletters and other information on international business, conducted the 
survey between Nov. 10 and Dec. 8 for Mead's 1990 edition of "Japanese 
Investment in U.S. and Canadian Real Estate Directory." 
</P>
<P>
"I was among the many people who believed that the Japanese interest in the 
United States had peaked," Mead said. "While there still will be a heavy level 
of investment here, I didn't see that it was going to get any higher. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some opposition to Japanese investment emerging in places like 
Hawaii," Mead said. "We also had heard the Japanese government was quietly 
urging Japanese investors not to buy high-profile U.S. properties. But not long 
after that, Mitsubishi bought a chunk of the Rockefeller Center." 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted after the announcement Oct. 31 that Mitsubishi Estate 
Co. had bought a 51% stake in the Rockefeller Group, which owns Rockefeller 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Findings of the survey showed 17.5% of the respondents indicated that their 
companies plan significant increases in real estate investment in 1990, while 
46% projected some increases. The most attractive U.S. metropolitan area for 
Japanese real estate activities, according to the survey, is Los Angeles. That 
is followed by New York City, San Francisco, Honolulu and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The strength of California is overwhelming with three of the top five cities, 
even after the earthquake. It was impressive," said Mead, who noted that the 
city rankings also revealed a wide portion of the country is being passed over 
by most Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
The optimism of Japanese companies contrasts with the apprehensive view of 1990 
among U.S. real estate executives, according to Mead, who publishes the monthly 
newsletter "Japanese Investment in U.S. Real Estate Review." He attributed the 
difference to the Japanese having easy access to capital while may American 
companies are having difficulty raising cash. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mead said that with the traditional Japanese business focus on the 
long term, many Japanese firms may not be as worried as Americans about the ups 
and downs in the U.S. real estate market. They also invest in markets where 
prices are rising or stable -- not falling. 
</P>
<P>
A few respondents to the survey expressed concern about American opposition to 
Japan real estate investment in the United States. However, not many said they 
considered local attitudes to Japanese investment when they selected cities or 
states for purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The most attractive states for Japanese investment, according to the results of 
the survey, were California, New York, Hawaii, Illinois and Washington. Mead 
said the preferred areas of investment are concentrated on the Pacific and 
Atlantic coasts and Hawaii, with a few exceptions. Investment interest focuses 
within two triangles from Houston to Seattle to Los Angeles and Southern 
California, and from Chicago to Miami to Boston, the survey indicated. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that several Japanese firms are cutting back on their 
activities in Texas, Arizona and Colorado, where there is comparatively little 
Japanese investment now. Reasons cited for the cutbacks included overbuilding 
and poor economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Mead said a few Japanese firms seemed to be expecting subsidies for locating in 
a particular area. The prevailing philosophy, however, is to ensure 
profitability over the long run. "Chasing bargains in a weak market could be 
asking for trouble," the survey said.
