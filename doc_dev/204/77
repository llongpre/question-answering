<TEXT>     Rockefeller, 54, had been planning visits this month to New Hampshire, Iowa
and California -- three states critical in the nominating process -- but he
canceled the trip to be with his family.;    That was in sharp contrast to his
aggressive travel and recruitment efforts in previous weeks.;    Rockefeller
had planned to make a decision in August. If he decided to run, he was
expected to announce his candidacy in September in Charleston at an event
complete with balloons, television networks and the national press corps.;   
"This is definitely not that kind of production," said Laura Quinn,
Rockefeller's press secretary.;    She refused, however, to say anything
further about Rockefeller's intentions. "He wants to make the statement
himself," she said.;    State Democratic Party Chairman Chuck Smith said he
spoke with many of Rockefeller's friends Tuesday and "practically everyone is
speculating that the answer is no. It's unanimous, actually.";    Smith said,
however, that he has not been officially notified. He said he has known
Rockefeller for 15 years and talks with him on the phone regularly.;    "I
will not be surprised at all if he does not run," Smith said. "If I had a
crystal ball, I would predict that he won't.";    Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va., said
he had not talked to Rockefeller but he assumed the senator would announce he
was not running this year.;    "It would seem to me that the signs have been
there in canceled appearances and a real focusing on the choice," Wise said.
"He's a pretty well-organized person and I would think that there would be
some planning" if he were going to declare his candidacy.;    Only one other
Democrat, former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, has announced his
candidacy. Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, and
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder are among other
Democrats said to be considering a run.  </TEXT>
