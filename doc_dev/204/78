  [Text] Washington, Feb. 25 KYODO -- President Bill Clinton 
Friday [25 February] applauded the congressional move to impose 
U.S.-set import targets on Japan, saying it represents "the 
determination of the American people" to open Japanese markets. 
  Clinton was commenting on a new trade bill sponsored by 
House 
majority leader Richard Gephardt that requires the U.S. 
Government to retaliate against Japan unless it meets specific 
U.S.-set import targets. "I think that it shows the 
determination of the American people to improve our trade and to 
open the markets (in Japan)," Clinton said at a news conference. 
  Clinton singled out in particular the involvement of Sen. 
John Rockefeller of West Virginia in the proposed legislation as 
he gave tacit endorsement to the Gephardt-Rockefeller bill. 
  Rockefeller, a second-term Democrat who has had extensive 
contact with Japan, joined Gephardt Thursday in sponsoring the 
"fair market access" and blasted the Japanese Government for 
"locking out" American products and services in the Japanese 
market. Rockefeller "understands what is at stake here," 
Clinton said, noting that the Democrat senator "has actually 
lived in Japan and, I think, is thought of genuinely as a friend 
of Japan." 
  Rockefeller spent three years in Tokyo from 1957 to 1960 as 
a 
student at the International Christian University. 
  Clinton, however, stayed short of giving outright support to 
the Gephardt-Rockefeller bill, asserting that "we've taken no 
position on any particular legislation." The bill, which 
received support from both Democratic and Republican 
legislators, requires the Commerce Department to define 
"objective criteria" for what the U.S. feels would be a "fair" 
market share in Japan for U.S. products, using the competitive 
position of U.S. firms in other developed markets as a benchmark. 
  Japan will be subject to U.S. sanctions under provisions of 
the legislation if it fails to meet the U.S.-set targets. 
  Gephardt said the proposed legislation was in support of 
Clinton's efforts to open Japanese markets through the framework 
trade talks, which collapsed on February 11 over U.S. demands to 
set import goals in Japan. 
  Tokyo has since moved to defuse the growing friction with 
Washington, with the coalition government of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa pledging Friday to compile a "voluntary" 
market-opening package by the end of March. The Tokyo decision, 
announced by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, drew a 
cautious response in Washington. 
  White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the Clinton 
administration has no information about the details of the 
proposed market-opening program. "We look forward to the 
details of the proposal," Myers told reporters. 
  The plan includes encouraging imports and foreign investment 
in Japan, easing government regulations and procedures involved 
in government purchases and spurring competitive policies, 
Japanese officials said.
