   Mitsubishi Estate Co., which is buying a
controlling stake in the company that owns Rockefeller Center, says
it wants to be a good corporate citizen and will do nothing to add
to frictions over the purchase.
   ``Americans might feel as if they were being invaded by
Japanese, especially because they have special feelings toward
Rockefeller Center, which has been a landmark in New York,''
acknowledged Kiyoaki Hara, Mitsubishi's managing director.
   The Japanese company is paying $846 million to buy a 51 percent
stake in Rockefeller Group Inc. Rockefeller Group's most famous
asset is the 22-acre Manhattan development, with its skating rink,
annual Christmas tree, Radio City Music Hall and office towers.
   The purchase, announced Monday, comes a few weeks after Sony
Corp. agreed to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $3.4
billion, another deal that stirred concerns over rising Japanese
investment in the United States.
   Indeed, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., waxed political about
the deal on the Senate floor Tuesday in Washington.
   ``This year when they turn on the lights to that Christmas tree
in Rockefeller Center, we Americans are going to have to come to
grips with the reality that that great national celebration is
actually occurring on Japanese property,'' Lieberman said.
   The older 12-building Art Deco portion of Rockefeller Center,
including Radio City Music Hall, most likely will not be controlled
by Mitsubishi past the year 2000. That property is under a $1.3
billion convertible mortgage. The mortgage owners, a real estate
investment trust, have the right to convert their holding into a
71.5 percent ownership of of the property after 2000.
   After the expected conversion, Rockefeller Group would own only
28.5 percent, with Mitsubishi owning 51 percent of that, or about
14 percent.
   For Mitsubishi, the more valuable assets are the Time-Life
Building and a 50 percent interest in the McGraw-Hill Building,
which are in the newer portion of Rockefeller Center; as well as
Rockefeller Group's nationwide Cushman &amp; Wakefield commercial real
estate brokerage and prime real estate parcels in New York and New
Jersey.
   Mitsubishi Estate, one of the related Mitsubishi companies
involved in everything from cars and banking to shipbuilding and
home electronics, said in a statement it did not plan to send
executives to join in Rockefeller Group management, which will
continue to manage Rockefeller Center.
   Mitsubishi Estate, which was established in the 1890s, is
Japan's second-largest real estate company, with sales of $1.9
billion in fiscal 1988. The largest, Mitsui Real Estate Development
Co., had sales of $5.9 billion in the last fiscal year.
   Hara said the deal would enable Mitsubishi, trailing in overseas
real estate business, to catch up with its rivals, Sumitomo and
Mitsui, which also have made major inroads into U.S. commercial
real estate.
   Rockefeller Group has been controlled by a family whose name
stands for American capitalism. The trusts that manage the family's
interests said they sold their majority stake in the company to
diversify its holdings.
   Richard Voell, president and chief executive officer of
Rockefeller Group, issued a statement saying the purchase by
Mitsubishi would ``enhance the financial strength of RGI. It
ensures the company's ability to continue to invest in Rockefeller
Center to enhance its stature as the most modern and prestigious
commercial complex.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters that
buyouts become controversial only when Japanese are involved.
   ``When British, Dutch and other European countries have been
engaged in similar acts, no particular attention was given to that.
... People have to look over these differences of nationality and
cultural background to see if it is truly an acceptable transaction
in accordance with normal standards of economic transactions,''
Watanabe said.
