   The Rockefeller Center tree arrived and the
city's first holiday traffic gridlock alert went out, but with
71-degree temperatures it sure didn't feel a lot like Christmas.
   The 75-foot-tall Norway spruce, donated by a Connecticut man,
was hoisted into place Friday morning right next to the center's
skating rink and down the street from the Radio City Music Hall's
Christmas show.
   The temperature in mid-Manhattan hit a high of 71 degrees a few
hours after the tree was put in place, just one degree short of the
1928 record for the date.
   During the next two weeks, crews will decorate the tree with
20,000 multicolored lights that will blink to life Dec. 3 at a
ceremony hosted by actress-singer Liza Minnelli.
   The tree was donated by Charles Cenci of Norwalk, Conn., in
honor of his father, who planted it in his front yard 61 years ago.
   ``I figured a lot of people would enjoy it,'' Cenci said.
   Cenci offered the tree for the city's annual holiday celebration
eight years ago, but officials said it didn't grow tall enough to
qualify until this year.
