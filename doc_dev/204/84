<HEAD>Sen. Rockefeller Calls Don Johnson `Scum'</HEAD>

   U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller said ``Miami
Vice'' star Don Johnson is ``scum'' who makes millions off the sex
and violence portrayed on television.
   West Virginia's junior senator told a group at the Preston
County Senior Center that ``Miami Vice'' and similar shows
shouldn't be watched by anyone. He also labeled the hit game show
``Wheel of Fortune'' as trash.
   Miami Vice ran for five years on NBC and its last show, a
two-hour special, was shown May 21.
   ``I know Don Johnson, and he is scum,'' Rockefeller told an
obviously delighted crowd of senior citizens Tuesday. ``He's just a
long-haired guy with good looks who makes a bundle selling sex,
drugs and violence on commercial television.''
   A spokesman for Johnson could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   On Thursday, Rockefeller spokesman Brian Detter attempted to
play down the senator's remarks, saying he was only commenting on
the nature of television programs.
   ``The senator was attacking and does condemn the attitudes and
values, such as sex, violence and drugs, portrayed in the TV show,
and not Don Johnson as a person,'' he said.
   Rockefeller made the remarks after being told that the rural
area had a drug problem.
   ``We are losing a generation of our young people,'' Rockefeller
said.
