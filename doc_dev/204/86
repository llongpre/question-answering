   NEW YORK _ Somewhere over the Rainbow Room, sometime in the next
two months, the RCA Building will become, unmistakably, the GE
Building.
   The huge, red neon ``RCA'' signs are being dismantled from the
top of the 70-story building in favor of a red neon ``GE'' _ a move
that, initially, did not put General Electric Co. in a good light.
   But the grumbling that greeted the announced name change last
summer subsided, the city gave its blessing and now workers are
removing all signs of the old RCA Corp. on the limestone
centerpiece of Rockefeller Center.
   A slab of granite with ``RCA Building'' chiseled into it was
removed Friday from one of the entrances. Two weeks ago workers
started taking down the neon signs that face south, west and north.
   GE bought RCA and its network television division, NBC, in 1986.
NBC, which is headquartered in the building, announced last July
that the building's name and signs would be changed. The building
is owned by Rockefeller Center.
   ``I guarantee you a lot of people aren't going to notice,'' said
Sue Gould, a partner in the graphics firm Lebowitz-Gould-Design
Inc., which designed the new neon signs.
   ``It will be the same color, the same glass,'' she said. The new
letters will be in outlined block italics, inspired by an old
General Electric monogram _ not the familiar script logo found on
GE products.
   The changeover, expected to be finished by September, received
approval last fall from the city Landmarks Preservation Commission,
which had input into the design of the new neon.
   Some who groaned at the thought of a new sign last summer may
not have known that the current RCA sign was installed in 1968,
replacing the original 1937 Art Decosign during an RCA ``corporate
image'' makeover, Gould noted.
   Several other buildings in Rockefeller Center also have changed
names since the 1930s when the complex was built, Gould said.
