   She is an American Muse, like her sisters in
Greek mythology, a patron of the arts.
   Here in America, the Muse is not mythic. Here feminine largess
has created museums, art galleries, ballets, orchestras and concert
halls that enrich the nation's cultural life.
   In this tradition is Alice Tully. And she at 87, in all modesty,
is hopeful there are more. There already are many.
   Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center is home to chamber music and
to the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which she helped
found. Today she is only an interested bystander, but her heart is
in it everyday.
   Her cousin, Arthur Houghton Jr., one of the founders of Lincoln
Center, suggested she pay most of the costs of a small concert hall
to be built at the center.
   ``When he asked, I had the most wonderful feeling,'' she
recalls. ``And I just knew this is for me. I said, `Oh, Arthur, I
can't think of anything I'd rather do.' I was overjoyed.
   ``On very important occasions, that voice inside of me tells me
things. And I heard inside of me, `Well, this is what you came to
do.'''
   The honor role of American Muses is long.
   In New York, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney founded the Whitney
Museum in 1930 to house American art.
   Lillie P. Bliss, Mary Sullivan and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller
founded the Museum of Modern Art in 1929.
   Jane Wrightsman, Lila Acheson Wallace, Brooke Astor and Joan
Payson have contributed hugely to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   Blanchette Rockefeller gave one-third of her American art
collection to the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco.
   Eleanor Belmont, by starting the Metropolitan Opera Guild, got
that opera house through the Depression. Lucia Chase for years used
her fortune to support the American Ballet Theater.
   Anne Bass, Nancy Zeckendorf and LuEsther Mertz donate to ballet.
Martha Hyder of Fort Worth aids the Van Cliburn Competition.
   There are builders of concert halls. The Filene Center at Wolf
Trap near Washington was built by Jouett Shouse with money from
that department store fortune.
   Buffy Chandler donated and raised money for the 25-year-old
Music Center of Los Angeles, for which Lillian Disney recently
donated $50 million to build Walt Disney Hall.
   Louise Davies gave the San Francisco Symphony's hall. Frances
Pew Hayes paid for the symphony's new hall in Naples, Fla. Patricia
Corbett, with money from door chimes, is a music philanthropist in
Cincinnati. The University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of
Music has Corbett Auditorium and Patricia Corbett Theater and at
the top of the Cincinnati Symphony's Music Hall is a ballroom named
Corbett Tower.
   Miss Tully is the granddaughter of Amory Houghton Jr., the
founder of Corning Glass. Her career was as a concert singer.
   ``My mother wasn't interested in the arts per se,'' she recalls.
``My parents never expected to have an artist in the family. But
they were very kind when they realized that I just wanted to sing,
and that was it, and that I was only too anxious to work. And so
they let me do it. That was wonderful, that they let me go and live
and study in Paris. At that time (1923) it was not the usual
thing.''
   She hasn't been a philanthropist all her life. ``I didn't have
anything to give until after my mother died,'' she says. ``I always
wished that I could because I was always so interested in that
world.''
   She knew how artists struggled. ``I had friends who were
painters and sculptors and singers and composers. They all needed
money.''
   Miss Tully, by nature a person of dignity, reserve and gracious
charm, was talked into allowing Alice Tully Hall to be named for
her for by John D. Rockefeller III. ``I would have liked it better
being anonymous. Absolutely. It took me six months to make up my
mind to give my name to the hall because I knew what would happen.
And it did.''
   Within a week, she says, requests for donations poured in. ``Now
it's worse than ever. When I came back on Monday, there was a stack
of mail like that.'' She gestures high above a table. ``And I had
taken out a stack like that when I went off on the weekend. I sit
up late at night opening mail.
   ``In the arts, the need is greater than ever. Expenses go up so
steadily. And of course that wonderful fantasy world of opera where
we can lose ourselves is the most expensive of all. It is so
wonderful and I have loved it since I was a child. I love all forms
of art.''
   Now she pours tea from violet-sprigged china in the living room
of her Manhattan apartment, with its moss-green carpet and
draperies and bleached-oak paneling. Flowering plants are placed on
occasional tables and windowsills. Her two pet Maltese dogs, Sophie
and Tati, scamper in to bark hello.
   That is present tense. Past tense she can remember the lunch
when she first heard of the Lincoln Center project, a year before
President Eisenhower turned the first spadeful of earth and gave
the signal to start the steam shovels, June 1959.
   She was not just a philanthropist. Alice Tully Hall, which opens
on the street, is tucked into a corner of the Juilliard School.
Miss Tully objected when Juilliard wanted to make it part of the
school. ``I had, above all, to stand my ground, which I did.''
   It took her three years of insistence to get the wide space
between the chamber hall rows. She has more letters over the last
20 years thanking her for the comfort than she has received about
the fine acoustics.
   Arthur Houghton also suggested to Gian-Carlo Menotti that he
call on his cousin when the composer was looking for money to start
a summer music festival in Spoleto, Italy. Miss Tully has been a
supporter ever since. In January, a benefit to repair hurricane
damage at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., was held
at Alice Tully Hall, with Miss Tully attending.
   Some have referred to Miss Tully as a grande dame of arts
philanthropy. But that is not how she thinks of herself.
   ``I just do what I like to do, what I think I have to do and
what it is my privilege to do.''
