   Russell Markert, who founded Radio City
Music Hall's Rockettes and choreographed their high-kicking
routines for 39 years, has died. He was 91.
   Markert, who retired in 1971, died Saturday at Waterbury
Hospital.
   Markert himself was a dancer in Broadway shows in the 1920s. He
was performing in ``No, No, Nanette'' in 1925 when he went to St.
Louis to realize his dream of producing a chorus line of tall
female dancers.
   The group he formed, ``The 16 Missouri Rockets,'' began
performing in St. Louis and later toured as ``The American
Rockets.''
   They attracted the attention of the noted New York showman
Samuel ``Roxy'' Rothafel, who hired them as ``Russell Markert's 32
Roxyettes.''
   When Rothafel was hired in 1932 to open the Radio City Music
Hall in New York's Rockefeller Center, Markert and the chorus line
came along and changed its name to the ``Rockettes.''
   His work was performed by more than 2,500 women.
   Born in Jersey City, N.J., in 1899, Markert began dancing in
grammar school, and later took dance lessons as therapy for a foot
injury he suffered in World War I.
   Nearly 450 Rockettes, alumnae and friends attended a charity
ball honoring his 90th birthday. Proceeds benefited the Russell
Markert Dance Scholarship at the Juilliard School in New York.
   Markert lived alone at a retirement home. Friends said he had no
surviving family.
   The hospital said the cause of death would not be released.
