   TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Estate Co. paid $416 million to boost
its holding in the company that partly owns and manages New
York's Rockefeller Center to 80% from 57.6%.
   The Japanese property company, one of the world's richest
developers with vast tracts in Tokyo's central business
district, bought the additional stake from Rockefeller family
trusts as part of an October 1989 agreement outlining terms
of its original purchase.

   That acquisition came to symbolize Japan's financial
strength and ability to buy U.S. property in the late 1980s.
Sensitive to the criticism the purchase aroused, a spokesman
for Mitsubishi Estate emphasized that the company's latest
purchase was made at the behest of the Rockefeller family
trusts, who exercised their right under the original
agreement to dispose of an additional shareholding.
   "This was a put option on the part of the Rockefellers,"
the spokesman said. "It was not the option of Mitsubishi
Estate."
   He said Mitsubishi Estate has no intention of altering the
management of Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns 28.5% of and
manages Rockefeller Center at the heart of midtown Manhattan.
The remainder is publicly held. Rockefeller Group also
comprises Rockefeller Group Telecommunications Services Inc.,
Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc. and Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc.
   "Things stay the same, the management stays the same," the
Mitsubishi Estate official said.
   The latest transaction completes the second step of
Mitsubishi Estate's acquisition of Rockefeller Group. The
Japanese company originally paid $846 million for 626,812
shares, or 51%, of Rockefeller Group's stock. Last July, it
bought another 80,566 shares, or 6.6%, for $111 million.
   Friday's acquisition of 275,856 shares, or 22.4% of the
Rockefeller Group, is the final transfer of stock envisioned
under the original sale agreement. The Mitsubishi Estate
spokesman said the company has no intention at the moment of
increasing its holding further. He said the latest purchase
would be covered out of the Tokyo-based company's working
capital.
   A property analyst at a foreign securities company in
Tokyo said the purchase "won't make any material difference"
in Mitsubishi Estate's earnings, which derive mainly from
rents in Japanese office buildings.
