   O. Stillman Rockefeller, scion of one of the
world's richest families, was bitten by a shark while swimming at
an exclusive island resort once owned by Malcolm Forbes.
   Rockefeller, 30, was injured Saturday in waist-deep water off
Laucala Island, according to The Fiji Times newspaper. He said he
felt his right leg being pulled and looked down to see cuts caused
apparently by two bites.
   He said he swam to shore and crawled to his bungalow, where he
telephoned for help. At dawn Sunday, he was taken by the Forbes
private plane to a hospital in Lautoka, Fiji's second-largest city,
and later flew to the United States.
   Rockefeller is the grandson of James S. Rockefeller, who was a
chairman of the City Bank of New York, which became Citibank.
   The isolated resort is owned by the Forbes estate. Forbes, the
multimillionaire publisher, died Feb. 24.

   For better or worse or until billions do them
part, says the lawyer for Ivana Trump, who thinks his client should
get half of her estranged husband's fortune _ which he estimated at
$5 billion.
   ``Marital property is property gained by the husband and wife
during marriage regardless of in whose name it is held,'' said
Michael Kennedy.
   Papers were filed Monday saying Mrs. Trump had no intention of
seeking a divorce and had never waived the right to an ``equitable
share'' of the money Trump made during their 13-year marriage.
   Trump had no immediate response.
   Trump's lawyers have sought to enforce a 1987 post-marital
contract. But Kennedy said that contract ``does not waive or
release Mrs. Trump's right to such marital property.''
   Kennedy denied reports that the contract called for Mrs. Trump
to receive $25 million in the event the marriage broke up.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor hasn't completed half the
community service she was ordered to perform for slapping a
policeman but is organizing a charity auction instead.
   Municipal Judge Paul G. Rubin, who sentenced the hot-tempered
celebrity to 120 hours of work at a shelter for homeless women and
children, said he may hold a hearing to decide if Gabor's plans
meet the court's order.
   That suggestion left Miss Gabor fuming.
   ``That Judge Rubin, who I find utterly disgusting, thinks he was
punishing me with this but he is not,'' Miss Gabor said recently at
her Bel-Air home. ``I have done more than he said I should _ this
auction has taken so many hours I can't count them.''
   Miss Gabor, convicted of slapping Beverly Hills police Officer
Paul Kramer during a traffic stop June 14, was sentenced to the
community service and three days in jail and was ordered to pay
court costs and fines totaling more than $12,000.
   The jail term was stayed while she appealed the conviction.

   President Bush's daughter is hoping to
avoid a court fight with her estranged husband by having a third
party help the couple sort through their troubles.
   Dorothy Bush LeBlond of Cape Elizabeth, who filed for divorce
from William LeBlond on Jan. 3, filed court papers asking to go
before a mediator on April 17.
   ``It's a way to get a neutral party involved,'' LeBlond's
lawyer, Thomas H. Allen, said Monday. ``There are financial issues
and issues related to children.''
   Mrs. LeBlond's lawyer, Phyllis G. Givertz, was out of her office
Monday, a secretary said.
   Mrs. LeBlond's divorce petition cited irreconcilable marital
differences but disclosed no details. The couple have two children,
ages 5 and 3.

   Joy Baker, wife of former Senate Republican
leader Howard Baker, will undergo lung surgery Wednesday, says a
family spokesman.
   Mrs. Baker was admitted Monday to St. Marys Hospital in
Rochester, Minn., said spokesman Tom Griscom. The hospital is
affiliated with the Mayo Clinic.
   Mrs. Baker underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1982. Griscom
said he did not think she had experienced a recurrence of the
disease, but that Baker wanted to wait until after the surgery to
provide further details.
   Mrs. Baker is the daughter of the late Senate Republican leader
Everett Dirksen. Baker served in the Senate from 1966 until 1984
and was President Reagan's chief of staff in 1987-88.
