   Ohio voters cast out Rep. Donald ``Buz'' Lukens, his long career
shattered by his conviction on a sex offense, while North
Carolinians boosted a black Democrat's bid to challenge
conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.
   ``Never argue with the voters,'' Lukens said finishing a distant
third in Tuesday's GOP primary, which he entered over the
objections of his party's leaders.
   The loss, following his conviction on charges of having sex with
a 16-year-old girl, apparently ended a congressional career that
spanned nearly 25 years.
   On the busiest day of primary elections so far this year, both
Helms and Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia coasted
to easy victories and turned their attention to the general
elections in November.
   In other races:
   _Ohio Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. picked up more
than 80 percent of his party's vote to claim the Democratic
nomination for governor. That sets up a November race against the
Republican nominee, former Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich.
   _West Virginia's former first lady, Dee Caperton, lost her shot
at joining the administration of her ex-husband, Gov. Gaston
Caperton, when she was beaten in the Democratic primary for state
treasurer.
   _The indicted mayor of Atlantic City, N.J., James Usry, clinched
a spot in a June 12 runoff by finishing second to a city councilman
in a seven-way non-partisan race.
   _Former Democratic Reps. Katie Hall of Indiana and Ken Hechler
of West Virginia lost comeback bids in their old districts. Ms.
Hall was beaten by Rep. Pete Visclosky, and Hechler lost to Rep.
Nick Joe Rahall Jr.
   _A 100-year-old eye doctor lost his race for Congress in North
Carolina but wouldn't admit it. ``I don't concede a damn thing,''
Harry Merritt Stenhouse said after being trounced by businessman
Don Davis.
   The big race in North Carolina was the contest to select a
Democratic opponent for Helms, the flamboyant conservative who sets
Democrats' nerves on edge.
   Helms had little trouble knocking off two GOP challengers,
businessman George Wimbish and salvage dealer L.C. Nixon, who could
manage only 8 percent of the vote each. With 99 percent of the
precincts in, Helms had 84 percent, or 155,101 votes.
   The top finisher in the Democratic primary was former Charlotte
Mayor Harvey Gantt, who is hoping to become the first black Senate
nominee in North Carolina in this century. But Gantt failed to win
the 40 percent needed to avoid a June 5 runoff, which second-place
finisher Michael Easley, the Brunswick County district attorney,
called for this morning.
   Thad Beyle, a political science professor at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said a runoff would be bad news for
Gantt.
   ``I think if you go on the basis of the political history of the
state, if a liberal or a minority doesn't win it in the first
primary, they'll lose it in the second primary,'' Beyle said.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Gantt had 257,485
votes, or 38 percent, to Easley's 205,972 votes, or 30 percent.
   They were trailed by John Ingram, a former state insurance
commissioner, with 118,018, or 17 percent, and R.P. ``Bo'' Thomas,
a former state senator, with 80,875 votes or 12 percent. Two other
candidates ran far behind.
   There was less suspense in Tuesday's other Senate contest, in
West Virginia, where Republican attorney John Yoder had no
opposition and Democrat Rockefeller had little more.
   With 89 percent of precincts reporting, Rockefeller had 176,341
votes, or 84 percent, to a combined 32,551 votes for his opponents,
inventor Ken Thompson and conceptual artist Paul Nuchims.
   ``I've won folks, how about that!'' Rockefeller told about 50
supporters at his campaign headquarters.
   There was no celebration for Lukens, who has served in Congress
or the Ohio state Senate since 1967. His career began to unravel
last year, when he was convicted of a misdemeanor for having sex
with a teen-ager. And although he refused Republican leaders'
advice to retire, voters decided it was time.
   According to final unofficial returns in western Ohio's 8th
District, state Rep. John Boehner won with 25,068 votes, or 49
percent, followed by former Rep. Thomas Kindness with 16,330 votes,
or 32 percent, and Lukens with 8,681 votes, or 17 percent. Mort
Meier, a bond underwriter, had 716 votes or 1 percent.
   Lukens said afterward that he has no immediate plans. ``I really
haven't thought beyond tomorrow,'' he said.
