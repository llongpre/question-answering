   Actress Mary Tyler Moore and TV producer Norman
Lear are among a wide range of celebrities, financiers and others
who gave large sums to the Democratic National Committee in the past
year, according to party records.
   Notables who made sizable contributions of less than $100,000
included: California stat legislator Tom Hayden, the husband of
actress Jane Fonda, $60,000; Miss Moore, $10,000; Miami Dolphins
owner Joseph Robbie, $50,000, and Lear, $25,000.
   The information was contained in DNC records filed in Austin,
Texas.
   The funds were given to the national committee's ``soft money''
account, which does not have to conform to limits imposed on the
candidates and the political parties by the Federal Election
Commission.
   The so-called soft money accounts are largely transferred by both
the Republican and Democratic National Committees to state parties.
   Democratic National Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. has said he would
disclose details of the committee's soft-money fund raising after
the election.
   Texas law, however, requires the parties to file either a list of
donors or a Federal Election Commission registration record when
they transfer money into the state from elsewhere.
   Since the soft money was not raised under federal limits, the
Democrats were required to submit a list of donors.
   Those listed as contributing $100,000 were:
   Andrew A. Athens, Chicago; Robert M. Bass, Fort Worth; Eli Broad
of Kaufman &amp; Broad, Los Angeles; Ann Cox Chambers, Atlanta; Richard
