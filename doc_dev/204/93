<LEADPARA>  Democrats' hopes of fielding a serious challenger to President Bush in 1992
dimmed Wednesday as Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., announced that he
was dropping out of the presidential contest.;    "We're narrowing the field
down until we get just the right one," Bill Hamilton, a leading Democratic
pollster, said in a touch of gallows humor after Rockefeller declared that he
just didn't feel ready to be president.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At the same time, an aide to former Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota said
Wednesday that the four-time presidential candidate had formed an exploratory
committee and was seriously considering a fifth campaign.;    "I pretty much
feel that he's going to do it from all the indication he's given," said Mike
Barr, McCarthy's national field coordinator.;    No 'perfect' candidate;  The
dilemma for the Democrats is that their remaining presidential prospects have
flaws that weaken them for the task of unseating a popular chief executive,
even though polls hint that Bush may be ripe for attack next year.;   
Rockefeller, blessed with his family's well-known name and fortune, had made a
favorable impression as he toured 22 states over the past three months. Now he
joins House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who pulled out last
month, on the sidelines, leaving former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts as
the party's only declared candidate.;    A low-key campaigner with the
charisma of an accountant, Tsongas has run a solitary race for four months
without making a dent on the public consciousness. And even he is frustrated
by the shortage of Democratic opponents to stir interest in the '92 campaign.;
   'Mired in obscurity';  "We're mired in obscurity until we get a debate and
can show we're not brain-dead," Tsongas said last week. "The Democratic Party
right now looks apologetic for its very existence. It sends a message of
hesitancy, which is the last thing we need.";    Compounding the Democrats'
frustration is the fact that, despite Bush's stratospheric poll ratings,
national surveys show that a majority of Americans are deeply troubled about
the state of the nation and might be receptive to a respectable alternative,
if only the Democrats could find one.;    The most dominant Democrat on the
scene, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, continues to hold back, insisting that he
has "no plans to run and no plans to make plans.";    But Cuomo also refuses
to rule out a race. His prolonged tease complicates the decision-making
process for other potential Democratic candidates, because he alone has the
clout and money-raising ability to enter late and scramble the field.;   
However, Cuomo's popularity at home is sagging after a bitter budget battle
that ended with his having to slash spending for social programs and break a
promise not to raise taxes.  </TEXT>
