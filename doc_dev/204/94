<HEAD>N.C. Convention Scuffle Could Mean Trouble, GOP Chairman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISBURG, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fistfights that erupted at the 4th
District Republican convention over the weekend could point to a
future showdown between supporters of presidential candidate Pat
Robertson and other delegates, North Carolina's GOP chairman says.
   ``Who was right, I can't say, but certainly there needs to be
more maturity and evenhandedness in handling the whole situation,''
Jack Hawke told The News and Observer of Raleigh.
   The confrontation involved the selection of three delegates to
the Republican National Convention in August. Competing for the
delegate slots were Robertson supporters and GOP party leaders
backing Vice President George Bush.
   After the confrontation, Robertson supporters walked out to hold
their own convention, while Bush supporters elected their three
delegates inside.
   A group of Robertson supporters then returned to the podium, and
screaming and fist-throwing followed as Bush and Robertson forces
battled for control.
   No one was seriously injured, officials said.
   Hawke said he fears possible reprisals from conservative GOP
members if differences aren't resolved at the state convention.
   ``When you are a minority party and you are used to being
behind, you need all the help and support you can possibly
receive,'' he said. ``But it's a very unfortunate threat for
anybody to oppose somebody just to get even.''

<HEAD>States With Bush Ties to Lodge With Veep at Convention</HEAD>

   Delegates to the Republican National
Convention from New Hampshire and three of the states George Bush
calls home will be lodging with the vice president in New Orleans.
   State GOP Chairwoman Elsie Vartanian said Monday that delegates
from Texas, Maine and Connecticut will join New Hampshire delegates
at the same hotel as Bush. The vice president's official residence
is in Texas and his summer home is in Maine. He has old family ties
with Connecticut.
   Vartanian said she assumes New Hampshire was chosen because of
Bush's friendship with Gov. John Sununu. New Hampshire voters also
gave Bush a boost when Kansas Sen. Bob Dole was making a strong run
at Bush's status as Republican front-runner.
   The convention is August 15-18.

<HEAD>Koch Considers Skipping Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mayor Edward I. Koch, the target of sharp
criticism for his attacks on presidential candidate Jesse Jackson,
may go to Ireland rather than attend the Democratic National
Convention, according to a spokesman.
   Koch may opt for Cardinal John J. O'Connor's peace pilgrimage to
Ireland, set for July 21-27, over the convention, which runs July
18-21, said mayoral press secretary George Arzt.
   Arzt, quoted in Sunday's New York Times, denied the flap created
by the attacks on Jackson was behind the mayor's decision ``to
rethink whether or not he would be a delegate.'' Koch was
excoriated in the news media after repeatedly criticizing Jackson
and saying Jewish voters would be crazy to support the candidate in
New York's primary.
   Koch, who endorsed Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. before the New
York primary, would have to commit himself to either Jackson or
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis to attend the convention as an
at-large delegate. Dukakis captured the New York primary; Gore
finished a poor third and discontinued his bid for the White House.
   Prospective at-large delegates must make their choices known by
May 27.

   U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller and his wife,
both selected as ``super delegates'' to the Democratic National
Convention, threw their support behind the presidential bid of
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis on Monday.
   ``Mike Dukakis has the experience and vision needed to move
America from the status quo,'' Sen. Rockefeller said in a prepared
statement.
   ``He knows how to make government work for the working man and
woman; he understands the problems of Appalachia, and he will be
the best president of the United States,'' he added.
   Rockefeller is one of 43 senators who will attend the national
convention as super delegates. Mrs. Rockefeller will attend as a
member of the Democratic National Committee.
