<LEADPARA>  Sen. Jay Rockefeller, who in March said he would not run for president in
1992, said today he had "reopened the door" and was strongly considering
seeking the Democratic nomination.;    Rockefeller, 53, said there was no
single reason or "magic moment" that led him to reconsider, and repeatedly
said sudden questions about President Bush's health had nothing to do with his
decision.  </LEADPARA>

ROCKEFELLER SAYS BUSH'S HEALTH WAS NO FACTOR
IN CONSIDERING RACE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "No. No. No. Absolutely not," said the West Virginia Democrat.;   
Rockefeller disclosed his decision to rethink a 1992 run after delivering a
speech to the Democratic Leadership Council, which is hosting a convention in
Cleveland that attracted a handful of potential Democratic candidates.;    The
Democrats gathered for the convention answered gingerly when asked about the
impact of Bush's health on the 1992 race. Many appeared split over whether
Democrats should make Vice President Dan Quayle's qualifications an issue as
they did in 1988, if Bush, as is expected, seeks re-election and keeps Quayle
on the ticket.;    Rockefeller said he did not view Quayle "as a particularly
important issue.";    Rockefeller, who was governor of West Virginia before
being elected to the Senate, is a Democrat from one of America's richest --
and Republican -- families.;    He said he would decide by late fall whether
to enter the race and planned a number of speaking trips around the country,
including New Hampshire, which hosts the party's first presidential primary
next March.;    It was just over a month ago, at a Democratic National
Committee meeting, when Rockefeller said he had ruled out a 1992 campaign.;   
Rockefeller said he decided to reopen the door because "of an increased
buildup of frustration" stemming from the failure of both parties to address
pressing problems such as affordable health care, energy and trade policies.; 
  "There is a lot that is seriously wrong in this country," Rockefeller said.
"Nobody is talking about these things.";    Rockefeller said he did not
believe his vote against giving President Bush authority to begin the war with
Iraq in January would hurt a candidacy. He said Bush's leadership "was superb
in the Persian Gulf" but said most Americans were far more worried about
domestic problems.  </TEXT>
