   The chairman of the Pepper Commisssion
defended on Friday its refusal to include recommendations on how to
pay the estimated $23 billion cost to provide health insurance for
all Americans.
   ``We did not name taxes,'' Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV told a
hearing of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. ``I
think had we named taxes we would have come into the same
criticism.''
   He said the commission had, in fact, accomplished a great deal
by putting a total price tag on its proposals _ $66.6 billion.
   Rockefeller said the group had narrowed the range of taxes that
could be used by establishing the financing would have to be
progressive, meaning the payment would grow with income and that
all age groups would have to pay.
   ``We think we bit the bullet,'' said the West Virginia Democrat,
adding that Congress and the White House can easily raise the taxes
for the plan ``when they decide what they want to do.''
   Committee chairman Edward M. Kennedy said that the bipartisan
commission, formed in 1988, was only supposed to ``outline health
policy'' and not substitute itself for the Finance and Ways and
Means committees.
   Rockefeller had said last month when the commission's report was
released that the tax-writing committees would have to come up with
the financing. Criticism of a lack of a financing plan came from
within the commission as well as outside it.
   Friday's hearing, held in cooperation with the Senate Finance
Committee, dwelled on the health insurance component.
   The other major component deals with long-term care for all
Americans.
   Rockefeller said the commission found that 32 million Americans
lack health insurance and that one-quarter of the uninsured are
children. Three-quarters of the uninsured are workers and their
families, with the majority working in small firms, Rockefeller
said.
   The commission, named after the late Rep. Claude Pepper of
Florida, recommended a jobs-based universal health insurance plan
because most insurance coverage already is provided through
employers. The plan calls for full coverage for everyone within
five years.
   Employers would either have to provide insurance or contribute
to a public plan.
   Friday's hearing was the first in a series of hearings on how to
develop and speed up passage of legislation to provide
comprehensive health care.
