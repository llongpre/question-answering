   West German computer hackers have
stolen data that provides access to key military and research
computers in the West and passed that information to the Soviets,
officials and news reports said.
   A West German television network on Thursday said passwords,
codes and other information came from computers in the United
States, Western Europe and Japan. West Germany prosecutors said
three people were arrested, and a TV network said at least 10
computer hackers were involved in the spy ring.
   The Norddeutsche Rundfunk broadcasting network said among the
computers was the U.S. Defense Department's general databank, known
as Optimus; a NASA and a ``Star Wars'' research computer; and
computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.
   The network said attempts were made to gain access to the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California, which
it called a key link in efforts to break into other U.S. computers.
   Clifford Stoll, an astrophysicist who did research at the
laboratory, said up to 50 military computers were broken into
through an astronomy computer, but that the hacker did not have
passwords for classified information.
   ``We were amazed! Here's some guy breaking into an astronomy
computer in Berkeley, reaching out into military computers trying to
search for information about SDI (the Strategic Defense Initiative,
known as ``Star Wars''), about nuclear warheads,'' Stoll said in a
telephone interview Thursday from his home in Cambridge, Mass.
   Stoll, who works at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at
Harvard University, said he and other researchers helped break the
spy ring by providing false information. He said someone linked to
East bloc groups wrote the laboratory asking for related
information, leading authorities to crack the ring. He did not
elaborate.
   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office
in Karlsruhe, said police in Hanover arrested two computer hackers
on ``suspicion of espionage activities for an eastern European
intelligence agency.'' Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin,
he said.
   ``They are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems''
and selling information to communist agents, Prechtel said.
   He said investigators are trying to assess how much damage was
caused to Western security interests.
   Roland Bachmeier, spokesman for the federal Interior Ministry,
said information was provided to Soviet intelligence agents.
   The officials declined to elaborate.
   In Hamburg today, West Germany's best-known club for computer
hackers said that in autumn 1987, it warned federal officials about
the vulnerability of international computer systems. However, Chaos
Computer Club president Wau Holland said federal officials ``did not
take the opportunity for a talk.''
   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said that at the bidding of Soviet agents,
the computer hackers gained access to a U.S. Defense Department
computer and important research and business computers elsewhere.
   The hackers obtained sensitive information that would allow the
Soviets themselves to gain access to the computers and develop
technology based on the information, the network said.
   The information would also give the Kremlin access to U.S.
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to
several European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace
research, the network said.
   ``Thousands of computer codes, passwords and programs were
delivered to the Soviets,'' the network said. ``They opened the door
for the KGB to gain access to some of the most important computer
centers of the Western world.''
   William Bardeen, head of the theory group at Fermilab in Batavia,
said Soviets participate in research there. ``So there are Soviet
scientists living at Fermilab and using the computers. There isn't
anything confidential or strategic in the computers.''
   Jeff Schwartz, spokesman for Los Alamos National Laboratory, said
he knew of no evidence that a foreign intelligence agency had gained
access to its classified computer system.
   Norddeutsche Runkfunk said the three suspects were detained
following searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin and
Hanover.
   ZDF television said the three suspects ``belonged to a hardcore
of 10 hackers.''
   According to Norddeutsche Rundfunk, authorities believe the three
West German hackers were recruited by the KGB, the Soviet
intelligence agency, in 1985 and ``were paid with cash and drugs ...
and were later forced to provide the codes and passwords to the
Soviets.''
   The network said the trio handed over information from the United
States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany
at a 1985 meeting with two KGB agents in East Berlin.
   In Tokyo, a laboratory official said today that unknown West
German hackers broke into a computer system in a Japanese government
research laboratory in 1985.
   The National Laboratory For High Energy Physics discovered that a
research project was penetrated in mid-1985, laboratory spokesman
Shinichi Watanabe said. He said no sensitive information was stolen,
and the laboratory has since heightened security by changing
passwords and other measures.
   He said it was not known if the intruders were part of the
alleged spy ring in West Germany.
