<HEAD>Company Says 7,000 Hackers Failed to Crack Computer Security System</HEAD>

   More than 7,000 hackers tried but failed to gain
access to a computer outfitted with a new security system in a
contest sponsored by the system's manufacturer, the company said
Monday.
   The weeklong contest ended Monday without any unauthorized
computer access, said officials of LeeMah DataCom Security Corp., a
Hayward, Calif.-based company which issued its public challenge
Oct. 9 to hackers across the country.
   The company offered a trip for two to St. Moritz, Switzerland,
or Tahiti to anyone who could retrieve a message stored in a
protected computer in the offices of KPMG Peat Marwick, a
consulting firm here.
   ``We have examined the audit printout and found that the
computer received a total of 7,476 calls and that the LeeMah
TraqNet successfully prevented any unauthorized computer access,''
said Brad Jude, manager of telecommunications security at Peat
Marwick.
   LeeMah said the odds against a hacker's penetrating the system
are about 1 in 72 quadrillion.
