   Three computer hackers suspected
of giving the Soviet Union information from military and industrial
computers worldwide were indicted on espionage charges, prosecutors
said Wednesday.
   The West German government called the breakup of the spy ring,
which gave the KGB secret data from 12 countries including the
United States, ``a major blow'' to the Soviets.
   In a four-page statement, chief federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann
said it was the first time his office had prosecuted hackers for
endangering national security.
   The men, identified only by their first names and last initial,
were indicted ``on suspicion of espionage activities for the Soviet
intelligence agency KGB,'' Rebmann said. The defendents were Peter
C. and Markus H. of Hanover, and Dirk B. of West Berlin, he said.
   The men were arrested in March. Peter C. and Dirk B. are in
prison, while Markus H. has been released pending trial, Rebmann
said. There was no indication when the trial would begin.
   The full range of information the Soviets received is not known,
but the espionage activities, first detected by a U.S. computer
specialist, had been in operation since at least September, 1986,
Rebmann said.
   The Soviets paid about $49,000 for the information, he said.
   The hackers gave the Soviets programs and passwords for computer
systems in industrial and military areas. They also gave Moscow a
``Security pack'' designed to prevent unauthorized computer
break-ins, Rebmann said.
   The three men broke into computers in West Germany, the United
States, France, Britain, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Austria, Spain,
the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, and the British colony of Hong Kong,
he said.
   Among the systems to which the hackers gained access was a key
U.S. Defense Department computer known as Optimus, according to West
Germany's ARD television.
   Other computers affected included some used by NASA and defense
researchers, as well as computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy
research in the United States, ARD said.
   The defendant Peter C. delivered his Soviet contact agent
``Serge'' information in about 25 separate meetings over the course
of 2{ years in Communist East Berlin, Rebmann said.
