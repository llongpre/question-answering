<LEADPARA>  For more than a year, officials at Digital Equipment Corp.'s secretive Western
Research Lab in Palo Alto watched as hackers invaded the lab's computers,
stole important software and read confidential messages. Short of breaking
Digital's primary electronic link with the outside world, officials found that
they could do little to thwart the hackers.;   Digital's top security official
believed they were dealing with a sophisticated West German spy ring that was
passing software to the Soviets. But in December 1988, following a call from
one of the hackers, Digital learned the interlopers were two high school
dropouts working at night from an office in Southern California, fueled by an
obsession with computers and bags of junk food.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BOOK FOLLOWS TRAIL OF HACKERS' HIGH-TECH CAPERS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Already legendary in computer security circles, the exploits of Kevin D.
Mitnick and Leonard DiCicco are one focus of a new book on computer crime,
"Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier" (Simon &amp; Schuster,
$22.95). The book details, for the first time, the extent to which the hackers
breached computer security at a number of Bay Area companies in the late
1980s.;   The book, by Katie Hafner, a former Business Week high-tech
reporter, and John Markoff, her husband and a reporter for the New York Times
who covers the computer industry, has hovered on a Bay Area best-seller list
since its release several weeks ago.;   In addition to Mitnick and DiCicco,
the authors chronicle the escapades of a West German hacking ring and of
Robert T. Morris Jr., who wrote the "worm" program that in 1988 brought down
the Internet, a network of 6,000 computers. Together, the three cases offer a
striking illustration of the possibilities -- and dangers -- of national and
international computer networks.;   Over several years, Mitnick and hacking
associates destroyed data at US Leasing, an equipment leasing company in San
Francisco; penetrated the development computers at the Santa Cruz Operation, a
software developer; and regularly broke into Digital computers in Palo Alto
and elsewhere. Mitnick, the authors said, was motivated by "the challenge of
the hack itself" and an "intellectual curiosity" of complex computer systems.;
  Among the book's disclosures: Mitnick stole a complete copy of VMS' source
code, the operating software that controls Digital's VAX mainframe computers,
and a copy of a security program called XSAFE. The source code can cost
Digital customers as much as $360,000, depending on the size of their
computer.;   Digital, the nation's second-largest computer maker, filed a
lawsuit against Mitnick but eventually settled out of court because of fears
that publicity over the incident could damage the Maynard, Mass., company,
Hafner said in an interview. "DEC was quite happy to see it not go to trial,"
she said.;   Mitnick was convicted on criminal charges and served a year in
jail and six months in treatment for what authorities said was an addiction to
computers. He still is doing computer-related work in Las Vegas, according to
a law enforcement official.;   In an interview, Digital officials acknowledged
the break-ins and stolen software. But they said the episode taught the
company how to make its computers more secure and spawned new software
products designed to increase security.;   "We put a lot of effort into a
security standard on the Easynet (Digital's internal network)," said Steve
Lipner, manager of the secure systems group. "The susceptibility to that kind
of problem has dropped way off.";   In an earlier episode, Mitnick and DiCicco
penetrated computers at the Santa Cruz Operation. But unlike Digital, the
authors said, the software company acted quickly, tracking the hackers to
Mitnick's Thousand Oaks apartment before they could do any damage or steal
software. Santa Cruz police traveled to Southern California and searched the
apartment. Mitnick pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and received a small fine
and 36 months' probation.;   Among the book's other revelations:;   (check)
Mitnick penetrated Digital's systems engineering group in Palo Alto at a time
when engineers were working secretly to introduce a new computer work station
ahead of its competitors. Although the intruders seemed uninterested in the
group's ongoing projects, Digital kept specifications of the new machine out
of the computer as a special precaution, the authors said.;   (check) Digital
unwittingly gave Mitnick a key tool for capturing passwords that enabled him
access to the company's computers. The tool, a software program called the
"loginout patch," was sitting in Digital's network after the company
discovered that a West German hacking ring had used it to penetrate VAX
computers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.;   (check)
Using the gateway to Digital's network at the Western Research Lab, Mitnick
was able to penetrate the company's brain center, its software development
center in Nashua, N.H., and make off with the latest versions of the company's
operating software.  </TEXT>
