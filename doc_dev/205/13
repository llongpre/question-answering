   West German authorities Monday
warned businesses and public institutions that Soviet intelligence
has obtained passwords and codes to gain access into their computers.
   A statement by the Federal Criminal Office said the codes
apparently were passed to the Soviet KGB by three West German
``hackers'' arrested this month.
   The three are suspected of selling thousands of codes and
passwords from Western military and research computers to Soviet
intelligence agents.
   Police authorities investigating the case have determined that
the hackers allegedly planned to break into or succeeded in breaking
into many other computers, the statement said.
   ``The KGB is capable of gaining full access to computer data of
businesses and public institutions,'' it added.
   It said obtaining computer codes and passwords has become a ``new
type of espionage by the East.''
   When the three were arrested, authorities said they had cracked a
major spy ring and warned of a new dimension in Soviet-bloc
espionage.
