   Officials investigating computer
spies who passed information from Western computers to the Soviets
believe the hackers did not make a major security breach, a
spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor said today.
   Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmermann called last week's breakup
of the spy ring a ``major blow'' to the Soviet KGB. He said Friday
the hackers were ``an extremely dangerous new threat'' to security
but that further inquiry would be needed to determine the extent of
the damage.
   Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for chief federal prosecutor Kurt
Rebmann, said today: ``The information obtained by the hackers does
not appear to be that sensitive.''
   Prechtel made the comment when asked about news reports saying
the hackers had mainly obtained access codewords for the computers.
   He said eight West Germans are still under investigation. Three
men were arrested last week.
   West Germany's ARD television network said the hackers tapped
into information from the U.S. Defense Department and computers
handling sensitive research on nuclear weapons.
   It said the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers included
the Defense Department's general databank, and a NASA and ``Star
Wars'' research computer.
   The television report said three hackers handed over information
from the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland
and West Germany at a 1985 meeting with two KGB agents in East
Berlin.
   The report said authorities believe West German hackers were
recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency in 1985 and ``were paid
with cash and drugs.''
