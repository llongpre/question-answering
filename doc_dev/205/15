   A hacker's success in penetrating a
non-classified Pentagon computer network and searching NASA and
Navy data banks shows security measures are failing to keep pace
with sophisticated computer systems, scientists say.
   ``It's a subject that makes (computer) people turn pale and
sweat,'' said Hal Masursky, a member of a National Academy of
Sciences subcommittee on computer security.
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Thursday that one or more
hackers, or computer buffs, successfully penetrated a Defense
Department computer network the night of May 16, then examined
files at the lab, the Patuxent Naval Air Station in Maryland and at
least one other facility into the early hours of May 17.
   No damage was done, no data was stolen and the incident is under
investigation by the FBI and security officers from National
Aeronautics and Space Administration headquarters in Washington,
said Haskell G. O'Brien, JPL's manager of communications and
computing network services.
   The break-in shows that ``fewer people are monitoring (computer
access) than should be. More people need to keep their eyes open,''
said Cliff Stoll, a computer scientist at California's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory. ``It's unfortunately easy for people to
randomly break in.''
   The network that was breached, named ARPANET, is a
non-classified network for sharing scientific information, and is
operated by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, O'Brien said.
   Thousands of computers are connected to the network at hundreds
of U.S. and foreign universities and research centers, including
some military research facilities and other NASA offices, he added.
   ``Networking has spread like wildfire, but the security
precautions are a new art,'' said Masursky, a Flagstaff,
Ariz.-based U.S. Geological Survey geologist who worked on several
NASA space missions. ``With a hacker who is very clever, trying to
guarantee he can't access things (computers) is very difficult.''
   O'Brien said authorities don't know if the hacker operated from
the United States or abroad, although NASA suspects involvement by
the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, West Germany, which has been
linked to past computer security breaches.
   ``The signature looked a little like things they do, but also
looked a little different,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the club told The Associated Press in Bonn, West
Germany, that he was unaware of the break-in.
   O'Brien called the incident serious because programs used to
design microcircuits could have been damaged.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said from Washington that
``there is no indication that any classified information has been
obtained by such hacker activity.''
   The break-in was the third known violation of computer security
at JPL in two years, O'Brien said, citing a previously publicized
August 1986 break-in by a West German hacker, and another last
summer, in which the perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted.
   The hacker in last month's incident first gained access to the
Pentagon network through another computer at an undisclosed
location, O'Brien said. Once inside, the hacker guessed a password
_ the name of a JPL employee _ to gain access to the lab's computer.
   The hacker then used JPL's Digital Equipment Corp. computer as a
conduit to enter another ARPANET computer at Patuxent, where
authorities noticed something was amiss and notified JPL, O'Brien
said, adding he didn't know how many other computers also were
penetrated.
   ``NASA security people are working with the FBI investigating
the details of this,'' he said.
   JPL spokesman George Alexander said that as soon as the break-in
was discovered, ``we pulled JPL out of the network.''
   ``Our procedures are being tightened considerably to make sure
this won't happen again,'' Alexander said.
   In April, a West German prosecutor revealed that a 24-year-old
West German hacker linked his home computer to about 50 U.S.
military computers by telephone. The electronic break-ins were
detected in August 1986 by Lawrence Berkeley officials.
   Targets included computers at JPL, the Berkeley lab and Air
Force Systems Command in El Segundo, Calif.
