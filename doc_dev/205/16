THE HACKER CRACKDOWN by Bruce Sterling Viking Pounds 16.99, 328 pages
ONE CAN appreciate the fun. You are hunched over the computer in your
bedroom, while Mom and Dad are relaxing downstairs in front of the other
kind of screen. You are hooked up to the telephone for hours, but it is not
costing a cent because the first call you make is to the phone company's
billing computer to tell it to forget the charges. Routine stuff; but then,
after hours of trying different numbers and different passwords - you hit it
big.
Pages and pages of telephone numbers and switching codes scroll down your
screen. This is no junk. The computer sending it is in the telephone command
centre. It thinks you are a supervisor and waits, like Aladdin's slave, to
do your order. So what? Well, how about this for a crazy thing? You re-route
everyone who dials the Palm Beach County Probation Department (in Delray
Beach, Florida) to Tina in New York State. She sells them pornographic
phone-sex.
Then you call up a bulletin board (a dial-up computer used as a message
centre by fellow crazies) to tell them, and particularly the Legion of Doom,
what a smart-ass you are. You sign on as Fry Guy, like usual. The other
phone phreaks, they laugh good. They say (but you disbelieve them) that they
have pulled many smarter raps. Then you go buy pizza.
Unfortunately, some people who read your message are not so completely
amused. They write it all down in spiral notebooks and then ask some even
less humorous guys: what kind of a perv would connect citizens who need the
Miami probation service to an East Coast phono-tart? And they say, maybe his
next little joke will be to call up some goddam computer and tell it to fire
a cruise missile at Wall Street . . .
So, a few months later, you are engaged in amusing converse with the Legion
in your bedroom when all the house doors are burst open by men with guns.
'You Fry Guy?', they say. 'Place your hands on your head and move real slow
away from that machine.' Mom and Dad say this is unbelievable.
But it happened. Fry Guy, a 16-year-old schoolboy who also admitted
infiltrating the MacDonald's payroll computer to give two of his friends a
raise, was convicted on May 31 1990, and put on probation.
The case thoroughly alarmed the US federal authorities. It showed that a
teenager with the simplest computer and a phone line could penetrate the
innermost fastnesses of the telecommunications network and re-program the
computers that control it. What mischief could he then do] Calls diverted or
monitored, accounts changed at will, telephone numbers deleted, altered or
created out of thin air; all this and more was within the grasp of the
hackers - and that 'more' was the ability to wipe out the whole telephone
system, including emergency services, for hours - possibly days.
Bruce Sterling has done a good job in describing the authorities' crackdown
since then on a group of hackers with sinister names, such as Legion of
Doom, Prophet, Urvile and Leftist, whose fun, it seemed, was becoming far
beyond a joke.
During the 1970s and early 1980s, the US authorities had been more tolerant
of computer pranksters. One reason was that they refused to believe that the
network of thousands of academic, defence and company computers linked by
global telecommunications could be penetrated seriously by outsiders.
Intrusions were difficult to detect, and any that were discovered seemed to
do relatively little damage. Even when hackers were using telephone lines
without paying, the 'theft' of time from the network seemed rather abstract.
However, by the mid-1980s, as home computers became more sophisticated, some
spectacular break-ins were occuring. By far the best account is in Clifford
Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg, which explains how a German hacker hijacked the
international telecommunications system and broke into high security
computers all over the US, including one at the Pentagon.
Sterling tells the story of a concerted counter-move by the authorities. In
Operation Sundevil, during three days in May 1990, 40 computers were seized
with some 23,000 floppy disks containing, stolen passwords and credit card
numbers, programmes and logs of information exchanged by hackers over the
network.
Sterling, unlike Stoll, shows some sympathy for the more 'responsible'
hackers (ie those doing it as an intellectual game rather than with criminal
intent), but he acknowledges that the line is difficult, if not impossible,
to draw. He also explores libertarian issues, such as the damage caused by
the security services to innocent computer users.
This is an interesting but uneven book, in which fascinating facts are
sometimes padded out with generalisations and a bit too much discussion of
issues. A newcomer to the field should start with Stoll's superb 'whodunnit'
of cyberspace. Sterling is better than adequate in explaining what happened
next.
