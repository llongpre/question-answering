   A hacker linked his home computer to
about 50 U.S. military computers to gain access to sensitive
defense and aerospace information, a prosecutor said Monday.
   The 24-year-old university student tapped into the worldwide
computers for nearly two years through telephone links, according
to the West German newsmagazine Quick.
   West German authorities dropped their case, however, for lack of
evidence. FBI spokesmen said they were investigating but declined
to say if charges would be brought.
   ``The (Bremen) court decided it could not be proven who
originated these calls,'' said Hans-Georg von Bock, a prosecuting
attorney in Bremen.
   He said the hacker scoured California computers at the Air Force
Systems Command in El Segundo, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasedena, and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley.
   Bock refused to say what the hacker, who lives in the northern
city of Hanover, discovered. Quick said he was able to find out the
names of U.S. Army officers in Japan and details about U.S. coastal
security systems.
   Authorities did not say if any important secrets were robbed.
   Bock said he remained convinced of the Hanover man's guilt. ``We
wanted to catch the suspect committing the acts, but unfortunately
that did not happen,'' he said.
   The prosecutor said West German investigators had been hampered
because law only allows wiretaps to investigate more serious crimes
like murder. A telephone tap would have enabled West German
authorities to trace the suspect's calls.
   Computer hackers use telephone connections to gain unauthorized
access to other computers, often just for fun.
   Bock said the computer connections in this case were made by
telephone via a computer at Bremen University.
   Quick said a connection with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
allowed the hacker to link to computers worldwide. However, the
magazine did not provide further details or identify the hacker.
   Bock said he could provide no details about the hacker because
the West German investigation had been dropped.
   Quick said the electronic break-ins were detected in August 1986
by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which does broad-based
unclassified research.
   The laboratory and its companion institution, the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, which researches nuclear weapons and the
Reagan administratoin's space-based missile defense system, are
operated by the University of California for the U.S. government.
   Quick said authorities questioned the suspect in June and that
the break-ins stopped at about the same time.
