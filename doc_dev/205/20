   Hackers penetrated a non-classified
Defense Department computer network last month, rummaging through
data at a Navy base, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and at least
one other center, the space agency said Thursday.
   The break-in occurred the night of May 16 and lasted into the
early morning hours of May 17, but no damage was done, said Haskell
G. O'Brien, the laboratory's manager of communications and
computing network services.
   ``NASA security people are working with the FBI investigating
the details of this,'' O'Brien told a news conference.
   It was unknown whether more than one person was involved or if
the break-in was achieved from inside or outside the United States,
O'Brien said. Unauthorized computer access is illegal, he added.
   Thousands of computers are linked to the network at hundreds of
U.S. and foreign universities and research centers, including
military research centers and other National Aeronautics and Space
Administration offices, he said.
   O'Brien described it as a non-classified network for sharing
scientific information. The network, named ARPANET, is operated by
the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   He said he considered the incident serious because programs used
to design microcircuits could have been damaged and because ``if
someone burglarizes my house, I'm offended. If someone accesses my
computer, I'm equally offended.''
   ``The Department of Defense regards as serious any attempt to
gain unauthorized access to its computer systems,'' Pentagon
spokeswoman Susan Hansen said in Washington. ``Let me assure you,
however, that there is no indication that any classified
information has been obtained by such hacker activity.''
   The break-in was the third known violation of computer security
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in two years, O'Brien said. He
cited a previously publicized August 1986 break-in by a West German
hacker, or computer buff, and another last summer, in which the
perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted.
   O'Brien said the hacker in last month's incident first gained
access to the Pentagon network through another computer at an
undisclosed location. Once inside, the hacker guessed a password _
the name of a JPL employee _ to enter the lab's computer, he added.
   The hacker then used the JPL computer as a conduit to enter
another ARPANET computer at Patuxent Naval Air Station in Maryland,
where authorities noticed something was amiss and notified the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, O'Brien said. He added that he didn't know
how many other computers also were penetrated.
   The lab's chief spokesman, George Alexander, initially said
members of the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, West Germany, broke
into the Digital Equipment Corp. computer at the laboratory, but he
later retracted the statement.
   ``We don't know for a fact that it was Chaos. ... There are
things that make us suspicious, but the bottom line fact is we
don't know,'' Alexander said.
   ``They're not kids,'' Alexander said of the club's members.
``They're adults. They are a worrisome group to American computer
experts. They're not just hackers doing pranks. They are group
whose motives and aims are not entirely clear.''
   A spokesman for the club told The Associated Press in Bonn, West
Germany, that he was unaware of the break-in, but would check into
the matter further.
   ``One thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is they (the
hackers) didn't get into any classified data banks nor did they get
into any sensitive information in the lab,'' Alexander said.
   Alexander said that as soon as the break-in was discovered, ``we
pulled JPL out of the network.''
   Several days after the break-in, Digital Equipment and JPL
officials ``rebuilt the system to make sure that if they (hackers)
planted any viruses, we were not going to continue using the
operating system they had been mucking around with,'' he said.
   A computer virus is a program surreptitiously inserted into a
computer to disrupt its normal program.
   In April, a West German prosecutor revealed that a 24-year-old
West German hacker linked his home computer to about 50 U.S.
military computers by telephone. The electronic break-ins were
detected in August 1986.
   Targets included computers at JPL, the Air Force Systems Command
in El Segundo, Calif., and at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in
Berkeley, Calif.
   In September, members of Chaos Computer Club announced that
youths who weren't club members used home computers to break into a
NASA computer information network used by at least nine nations,
and that they obtained secrets about the U.S. space program.
   The club said the hackers gained regular access to at least 20
NASA computers between May and September 1987 through a flaw in the
security system.
   At the time, NASA officials in Washington denied that secret
information had been obtained through its computer network.
