   Three West German hackers were found
guilty today of selling Western military computer codes to the
Soviet KGB and given suspended sentences ranging from 14 months to
two years.
   Dirk Brzezinski, Peter Carl and Markus Hess were arrested in
March after an investigation by U.S. and West German officials
revealed the three had obtained passwords and codes giving them
access to key military and research computers in the United States,
Western Europe and Japan.
   A fourth man, 30-year-old Karl Koch, who was also arrested in
the case, committed suicide in May.
   At the trial, which began Jan. 11, all three admitted guilt in
obtaining the codes to sell them to a Soviet KGB agent in East
Berlin.
   In today's decision, Chief Judge Leopold Spiller said the three
were given suspended sentences because ``it could not be proven
that substantial damage had been done to the Federal Republic (West
Germany) or its NATO partners.'' But Spiller also said the three
sold the computer codes for money.
   Carl was sentenced to 24 months, Hess 20 months and Brzezinski
14 months.
   All three men were freed on suspended sentences as long as they
stay out of trouble with the law for the duration of their terms.
   Carl, 35, told the court during the trial that he could only
identify the KGB agent he dealt with as ``Serge'' and said he did
not wish to reveal anything more about the Soviets in open court
for fear of reprisals.
   Court records show that Carl made at least 25 contacts with the
Soviets and received a total $54,500 for the computer information,
which was split among the hackers, amateurs who figure out ways to
access private computer systems.
   Brzezinksi, 30, told the court that Koch had the original idea
of selling the information to the KGB.
   According to Brzezinski, Koch claimed he had gained access to
the U.S. Defense Department general databank known as Optimus.
   U.S. and West German news media reported the hackers also gained
access to a NASA and a ``Star Wars'' research computer, and
computers linked to nuclear weapons and energy research in New
Mexico and the Fermi Laboratory in Illinois.
   However, U.S. officials said last year that although the hackers
obtained sensitive codes and passwords to enter the computers, they
were stopped short of obtaining any highly classified information.
   Investigators said at the time of the arrests that codes and
passwords for computers in Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy,
Switzerland and West Germany were also obtained and sold to the
Soviets by the hackers.
