   The Soviet Union lodged a ``resolute protest''
over the expulsion of a military attache allegedly involved in a spy
operation aimed at learning how the U.S. government protects
computer secrets.
   Lt. Col. Yuriy Nikolayevich Pakhtusov, 35, was told to leave
Thursday. An FBI investigation had led to his arrest Wednesday
night, just a day after the Bush administration opened a high-level
dialogue with the Soviet Union.
   Pakhtusov was described by a U.S. source as a significant catch
because he is a member of the Red Army's GRU intelligence arm. One
official said Pakhtusov was caught ``red-handed.''
   But the Soviet Embassy issued a statement saying the expulsion
order ``could be only qualified as a deliberate provocation against
a Soviet diplomatic official.''
   It denied that Pakhtusov engaged in any wrongdoing and said the
embassy has lodged a ``resolute protest'' with the State Department.
   Asked about the Soviet allegations today, department spokesman
Charles Redman said, ``The reason for our actions is very simple. He
was caught red-handed with the goods and no amount of verbiage can
change that.''
   Redman added that the Soviets have informed the United States
that Pakhtusov will be leaving as requested.
   He said there is no reaosn to believe the incident will affect
U.S.-Soviet relations. The Soviets are aware that the United States
will protect its national security interests whenever it's
threatened, he said.
   State Department press officer Dennis Harter said the Soviet
Embassy was informed that Pakhtusov was being expelled for
``activities incompatible with his diplomatic status.''
   According to one government source, Pakhtusov was asked to leave
by Saturday.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov called the
expulsion a ``gross provocation'' at a regularly scheduled news
briefing today in Moscow, but he did not announce any retaliatory
Soviet action.
   He said ``the U.S. side is assuming all the responsibilities'' of
the decision to expel Pakhtusov.
   Repeatedly asked by reporters whether Pakhtusov was engaged in
spying, Gerasimov responded: ``He did not violate diplomatic status
with whatever he did.''
   Violating diplomatic status is an oft-used diplomatic euphemism
for spying.
   In Vienna on Tuesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
for the first time with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and announced plans for a visit to Moscow in May.
   The FBI probe was set in motion in August, two months after
Pakhtusov's arrival, when he approached an American employee of a
company that deals in classified information.
   The American, who was not identified, reported the contact to the
FBI, which began monitoring contacts between the two.
   There is growing evidence that the Soviets are placing high
priority on gaining access to Western computers with sensitive
military, nuclear and space research information stored inside them.
   A week ago, West German authorities charged a computer hacker
with espionage and said a total of eight people were suspected of
selling sensitive computer data from the United States and allied
countries to the Soviets from 1986 through last year.
   The German action was described by officials as the first
confirmed case of Soviet computer espionage. A State Department
official, who asked not to be identified, said there was no
connection between the German and Pakhtusov cases.
   From Moscow the official Soviet news agency Tass today expressed
outrage at the expulsion and reported that Pakhtusov was arrested
while taking out the garbage at his home in Virginia.
   Neither Tass nor other Soviet media said whether there would be
any retaliatory action taken against Americans in the Soviet Union.
   Soviet interest in penetrating Western computer banks has added a
new dimension to the ongoing effort to make stored data secure
without making it inaccessible to those with a legitimate need for
it.
   Previously, the problem had been limited to hackers who try to
penetrate computers as a hobby.
   Pakhtusov is the first publicly acknowledged case of a Soviet
envoy being expelled by the United States since December 1987, when
Mikhail Kathov, second secretary at the Soviet mission to the United
Nations, was ordered home for trying to obtain information on
military technology.
   In September 1986, the Reagan administration, alleging widespread
spying activities, ordered the expulsion in stages of 105 Soviets
from Moscow's U.N. mission. The Soviets retaliated by expelling a
number of American diplomats from Moscow.
