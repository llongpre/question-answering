   A West German computer ``hacker''
electronically raided about 50 U.S. military computers containing
defense and aerospace information, a prosecutor said today.
   The 24-year-old student gained access to the computers for
almost two years through his own computer and telephone links,
according to the West German newsmagazine Quick.
   Some of the raided computers are at the Air Force Systems
Command in El Segundo, Calif., and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasedena, Calif., said Hans-Georg von Bock, prosecuting attorney
in Bremen.
   FBI spokesmen said their agency was investigating. They declined
to say whether charges would be filed.
   Bock refused to say what the student, who is from Hanover,
discovered in his computer break-ins. Quick said the student was
able to find out the names of U.S. Army officers in Japan and
details about U.S. coastal security systems.
   However, no one said whether the man uncovered any important
secrets.
   Bock said Bremen authorities had abandoned their inquiry for
lack of evidence. Bock refused to provide any details about the
suspect _ including his name _ because the investigation had been
dropped.
   ``We wanted to catch the suspect committing the acts, but
unfortunately that did not happen,'' Bock said.
   He said the electronic links were made by telephone via a
computer at Bremen University.
   ``The (Bremen) court decided it could not be proven who
originated these calls,'' Bock said.
   Hackers are computer enthusiasts who try to gain unauthorized
access to other computers through telephone lines. Some hackers say
they commit their electronic break-ins just for fun.
   Quick said the electronic break-ins were detected in August 1986
by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., which does
unclassified research. The laboratory and its sister institution,
the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, which is involved in nuclear
weapons research and the Strategic Defense Initiative known as
``Star Wars,'' are operated by the University of California for the
U.S. government.
   Quick said authorities questioned the student in June and the
break-ins stopped at about that time.
   Bock said West German investigators had been handicapped because
German law prevents them from tapping telephones unless they
suspect a more serious crime, such as murder.
