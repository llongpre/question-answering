   Many U.S. and European officials fear improved
relations will lead to even more rapid acquisition by the Soviet
bloc, legally and illegally, of the West's sensitive military
technology.
   American officials say the Soviets spend at least $1 billion a
year to obtain Western technology and often will pay more than
three times market value for something they want.
   Analysts say the Soviets obtain high technology with the help of
unscrupulous Western businessmen who may acquire the goods legally,
then divert them to the East illegally. Soviet agents get other
material through espionage.
   The diversions are taking place in the more relaxed atmosphere
created by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's peace and disarmament overtures,
which have altered Western perceptions of the Soviet threat.
   ``There is no sign that Soviet efforts have diminished, and
evidence is that they are increasing,'' said William Waldegrave,
Britain's deputy foreign secretary.
   Francois Heisbourg, head of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London, said losses now may surpass those of
the late 1970s, when Soviet agents penetrated key ministries in
France and West Germany.
   ``We will see an enormous draw from the West,'' said John
Galvin, the American general who commands NATO forces in Europe.
``We'll probably lose the technological edge we've had for
decades.''
   The United States and 16 allies belong to the Coordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, known as CoCom, which
tries to stem the flow of sensitive military goods to the Soviet
bloc.
   Stephen Bryen, former U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense for
trade security, estimated Western businessmen smuggled items worth
up to $2 billion to the Soviet East in 1988.
   Recent diversions and thefts, analysts say, have allowed Soviet
engineers to make more accurate missiles, quieter submarines and
stronger aircraft wings, and to clone advanced computers they might
have taken years to develop.
   They say the Soviets also are acquiring such new battlefield
technology as helicopter weapons systems and tank armor, and
Western experts worry that the trend to greater trade between East
and West will increase the flow.
   ``There is no question they are ... on a path toward getting
more technology,'' said Richard Perle, a former top Pentagon
official who championed export controls. ``We certainly gave away a
lot during detente, and this looks like a rerun.''
   Gorbachev's ambitious plan to modernize the Soviet economy has
created intense interest in Western business circles.
   Dozens of Western companies are entering joint ventures that
eventually may offer Soviet consumers a variety and quantity of
goods and services not available now. Joint ventures also may
provide Western technology, money and management expertise
Gorbachev sorely needs.
   Some Western allies urge caution lest such cooperation allow the
Soviets to concentrate its scarce resources on defense projects,
but others want to help Gorbachev's liberalization program.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany said
recently: ``In view of the great economic problems confronting the
Soviet Union, as well as its process of restructuring, a Western
readiness for cooperation in the economic sector is strongly
needed, not least in our own interest.''
   An American serving in Paris said privately that, if the thaw
continues, ``it will probably be more and more difficult to
maintain the support for CoCom that we've had.''
   John C. Kelley Jr., director of strategic investigations for the
U.S. Customs Service in Washington, said increased trade will
provide ``more opportunity to mask some of the items and ...
commingle more high-technology merchandise'' with legitimate goods.
   CoCom, based in Paris, regulates shipments of weapons, nuclear
technology and ``dual-use'' products, such as communications
equipment, that have both commercial and military applications.
   Aaron Karp of the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute said Soviet engineers now are seeking manufacturing
processes rather than single items.
   In March, West German authorities accused several German
computer hackers of pirating technical data from the Pentagon and
research centers in the United States, Europe and Japan over two
years. Investigators say the hackers sold it to the Soviets for
money and drugs.
   Authorities said the information helped Soviet engineers read
data in some crucial industrial and military installations.
   ``This is a new quality of espionage by the East,'' said Gerhard
Boemen, chief of West German intelligence services.
   Espionage successes for the Soviets mean Western researchers
must invest heavily to find something better than what has been
lost.
   NATO officials say a spy ring in the U.S. Army in West Germany,
broken up last August, gave the Kremlin even more sensitive
information than originally believed.
   Italian authorities charged two men in February with selling
secrets about a computer system being developed for the alliance.
   French police seized a disassembled particle accelerator packed
in 18 crates and destined for the Soviet Academy of Sciences in
Moscow. The police arrested Aime Richardt, who was implicated in
previous cases. French customs charged that the machine is used to
accelerate heavy ions, which gives it military applications. But
Richardt claimed it was an accelerator of light ions and was
suitable only for scientific research. The case is still pending in
a French court.
   Viktor Karpov, the Soviet arms negotiator, laughed when asked
whether Moscow's theft of technology had increased.
   ``Look at that Florida case,'' he said. ``The man tried to sell
to the FBI, not the KGB.''
   A former defense worker in Florida had called the Soviet Embassy
to offer plans. FBI agents on the line arrested him.
