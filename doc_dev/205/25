   Three West Germans ``hackers'' went
on trial Thursday charged with selling Western military computer
passwords and codes to the Soviets.
   Dirk Brzesinski, Peter Carl and Markus Hess were arrested last
March after an investigation by U.S. and West German officials
revealed they had obtained information giving them access to key
military and research computers in the United States, Western
Europe and Japan.
   A fourth man, 30-year-old Karl Koch, who was also arrested in
the case, committed suicide in May.
   Brzesinski, 30, a computer specialist, told the court that Koch
had come up with the idea of selling the information.
   ``We decided in 1986 to sell the information to the Soviets for
1 million marks ($605,000) to help them even out the technical
know-how advantage of the West,'' Brzesinski said.
   Carl, 35, said he was responsible for contacting the Soviet
trade mission in East Berlin, where he dealt with a contact
identified only as ``Serge.''
   Carl said he did not want to reveal anything more about the
Soviets in court for fear of reprisals.
   Court records show Carl made at least 25 contacts with the
Soviets and received a total of 90,000 marks ($54,500) for the
information.
   According to Brzesinski, Koch before his death claimed he had
managed to gain access to the U.S. Defense Department general
databank known as Optimus.
   After the arrests last year, U.S. and West German news media
reported that other computers the hackers entered included a NASA
and a ``Star Wars'' research computer, as well as computers linked
to nuclear weapons and energy research in Los Alamos, N.M., and the
Fermi Laboratory in Illinois.
   However, U.S. officials said last year that although the hackers
obtained sensitive codes and passwords to enter the computers, they
were stopped short of obtaining any highly classified information.
   Investigators have said that codes and passwords from computers
in Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany were
also obtained and sold to the Soviets.
   A verdict in the trial, scheduled to be completed in 12
sessions, is expected Feb. 8. The men face up to 15 years in prison
each if convicted.
