<HEAD>Court Convicts German Hackers of Selling Computer Codes to Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CELLE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court convicted three West German
hackers on Thursday of selling Western military computer codes to
the Soviet KGB secret police, and gave them suspended sentences
ranging from 14 months to two years.
   Chief Judge Leopold Spiller said sentences were suspended
because ``it could not be proven that substantial damage had been
done to ... (West Germany) or its NATO partners'' through the
hackers' actions. But he also said the three purposely sold the
computer codes for money to the KGB.
   Court records show one defendant, Peter Carl, made at least 25
contacts with the Soviets and received $54,500 for the computer
information, which he split with the others.
   Carl, 35; computer specialist Dirk Brzezinski, 30; and computer
programmer Markus Hess, 28, were arrested in March 1989 after an
investigation by U.S. and West German officials revealed they had
obtained passwords and codes giving them access to major military
and research computers in the United States, Western Europe and
Japan.
   Carl drew 24 months; Hess, 20 months; and Brzezinski, 14 months.
   A fourth man, Karl Koch, 30, was arrested in the case, but
committed suicide last May.
   U.S. officials said last year that the hackers were stopped
short of obtaining any highly classified information.
   Investigators said at the time of the arrests that codes and
passwords for computers in Japan, Britain, France, Italy,
Switzerland and West Germany were also obtained and sold to the
Soviet by the hackers.
   All three defendants admitted guilt in obtaining codes to sell
to a Soviet KGB agent in East Berlin.
   At the trial, which began on Jan. 11, Carl testified he could
identify the agent only as ``Serge'' and said he did not wish to
reveal anything more about the Soviets in open court for fear of
reprisals.
