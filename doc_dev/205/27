   London police said Sunday that they tracked down
an unemployed computer hacker who tapped into military, commercial
and university systems in Europe and the United States over several
years.
   They said the man was questioned about alleged attempts to
blackmail a computer company but that there was not enough evidence
to pursue the matter.
   ``He was officially cautioned about that but, as he wasn't
charged with anything, we are not identifying him,'' said a
spokeswoman at Scotland Yard.
   A Scotland Yard statement said only that the man was 23 and out
of work. It said the inquiry by its Serious Crimes Squad lasted
five weeks.
   The Sunday Telegraph, which broke the story, said the man was
connected with an ``international ring of computer hackers who have
penetrated the electronic information systems of more than 200
sensitive military and commercial establishments.''
   It said the computer systems penetrated included NASA, the U.S.
Nuclear Defense Agency, the British Defense Ministry, ``as well as
those of American defense establishments and suppliers.''
   The weekly said American security experts were going to London
to examine papers found during the police investigation which gave
details of hacking activities over five years.
   The newspaper said the man used computers on the University of
Surrey campus at Guildford, 30 miles southwest of London, and had
not committed any offense under British law.
   It said the man's hacking included finding out details of
people's financial accounts and that his motive appeared to have
been the ``pleasure of beating the system.''
   It reported he had contacts with unidentified hacking clubs in
the United States and with one in West Germany ``which specializes
in gaining access to military systems. But there is no suggestion
that he tried to disclose secrets to foreign countries,'' the
report added.
   The newspaper said the alleged blackmail attempt originated with
a request to a large computer firm for a $5,250 fee to be shown how
its equipment had been used to tap different computer systems.
   The firm went to the police, who traced the hacker to one of
Surrey University's 900 terminals and trapped the man when the
university collaborated in setting up a terminal programed to
monitor external computer calls, the newspaper said.
