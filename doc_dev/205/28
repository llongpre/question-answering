   The Common Market has agreed to cut its
use of chlorofluorocarbons, the synthetic compounds that destroy the
Earth's ozone layer, by 85 percent and seek a total ban on its
production by the end of the century.
   Chlorofluorocarbons, invented in 1930, are used in aerosol
sprays, refrigeration coolants, cleaning agents and several other
products. The compounds are blamed for depletion of the ozone layer
that protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays and
for an increase in skin cancer.
   Environmental officials meeting in Brussels agreed Thursday to
give the 12 EEC member nations a mandate to completely phase out the
manufacture and use of the compounds by the year 2000. In
Washington, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William
Reilly urged President Bush to support the chlorofluorocarbon
phase-out by the end of the century. But his proposal was not
immediately endorsed by the administration, the Washington Post
reported today.

   The Bush administration is proposing a new U.S.
policy toward Central America that includes rewards for Nicaragua if
it passes certain ``checkpoints'' on the road to democracy, say
congressional and administration sources.
   While still in its formative stages, the new policy is outlined
in a secret 10-page document Secretary of State James A. Baker III
showed to House and Senate leaders Thursday during a hastily
arranged visit to Capitol Hill. Baker made clear to lawmakers that
he does not intend to abandon the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels.
   He told congressional officials he would seek to renew the U.S.
``humanitarian'' aid, which runs out at the end of this month, for a
year, according to some present at the meetings. Aid would continue
to flow at current rates _ about $4 million a month _ and would keep
the rebels available as a standby fighting force until after
Nicaragua's national elections, which are being moved up to early
1990.

   Terry Rakolta unexpectedly won a skirmish and now
she wants to start a battle against what she says are sexually
oriented and violent programs that cut into the network television
fare her children can watch.
   The 40-year-old mother of four, offended by the off-color humor
on the prime-time series ``Married ... With Children,'' conveyed her
distaste to the show's major advertisers in a flurry of letters
starting in January.
   Much to Mrs. Rakolta's surprise, the letters prompted two of the
nation's largest advertisers, Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. and McDonalds
Corp., and several others to pull their commercials from the series,
the top-rated program on the fledgling Fox Broadcasting Co. network.

   A Harvard astronomer turned sleuth helped crack an
international electronic spy ring in West Germany by tracking down
the ``hacker'' who broke into his computer files.
   For more than six months, finding the computer snoop was a lonely
obsession for 38-year-old Clifford Stoll, who initially was unable
to convince the FBI to investigate the computer break-in.
   On Thursday, a West German official announced the arrests of
three hackers who allegedly acquired sensitive military computer
passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets. The Pentagon has
not determined the extent of the damage to U.S. security. A West
German television network said the passwords and other information
came from key military and research computers in the United States,
Western Europe and Japan.

   U.S. mortality rates for two of the three leading
causes of death _ heart disease and stroke _ are headed downward,
but cancer is on the increase as unhealthy habits of yesteryear
catch up with the older population.
   The Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that the U.S. death
rate from heart disease in 1987 was 313 per 100,000 people, down
from 318 the year before. For stroke, or cerebrovascular disease,
the rate was 61 per 100,000, down from 62.
   But the mortality rate from cancer, the nation's No. 2 killer,
has been going up in recent years, the CDC said. There were 196
cancer deaths in 1987 for every 100,000 Americans, up from 195 the
year before.

   A city program considered a national model for
steering contracts to minority businesses was overturned as too
``intrusive'' by the state Supreme Court, a ruling officials say
could halt contracting for months.
   The court based Thursday's 7-0 decision on a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling in January that overturned a similar program in Richmond, Va.
It was the high court's first reversal of an affirmative action
program after years of upholding them.
   The state court said Atlanta failed to produce enough evidence of
past discrimination to justify its program. It also said the program
was too broadly drawn and that the city had not considered ``less
intrusive'' methods of increasing minority participation in city
contracts. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling on behalf
of the American Subcontractors Association effectively dismantles
the program.
