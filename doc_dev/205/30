<LEADPARA>  A computer "hacker" who was trying to help others steal electronic passwords
guarding large corporate computer systems around the country Friday pleaded
guilty to wire fraud in a continuing government crackdown on computer crime.; 
  Federal prosecutors recommended that Leonard Rose Jr., 32, of Middletown,
Md., be sent to prison for one year and one day, which would be one of the
stiffest sentences imposed to date for computer crime. Sentencing is scheduled
for May before U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  'HACKER' PLEADS GUILTY IN AT&amp;T CASE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 3/27/91, pg. 2F);  Because of an error by
the Washington Post, an article in Saturday's Mercury News gave incorrect
information about Leonard Rose Jr., the Maryland computer hacker who pleaded
guilty last week to two counts of wire fraud involving his illegal possession
of an American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. computer program. Rose was not a
member of the "Legion of Doom" computer hacking group and did not participate
in the group's alleged activities of breaking into and rummaging through
corporate and government computer systems.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Cases such as those of Rose and a Cornell University graduate student who
was convicted last year of crippling a nationwide computer network have shown
that the formerly innocent pastime of hacking has potentially extreme economic
ramifications. Prosecutors, industry officials and even some veteran hackers
now question the once popular and widely accepted practice of breaking into
computer systems and networks in search of information that may be shared with
others.;    "It's just like any other form of theft, except that it's more
subtle and it's more sophisticated," said Geoffrey R. Garinther, the assistant
U.S. attorney who prosecuted the Rose case.;    Rose -- once part of a group
of maverick hackers who called themselves the Legion of Doom -- and his
attorneys were not available for comment after the guilty plea Friday. The
single fraud count replaced a five-count indictment of the computer programmer
that was issued last May after a raid on his home by Secret Service agents.;  
 According to prosecutors, Rose illegally obtained information that would
permit him to secretly modify a widely used American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
Unix software program -- the complex instructions that tell computers what to
do. The two former AT&amp;T employees who provided these information "codes" have
not yet been prosecuted.;    Rose altered the AT&amp;T software by inserting a
"Trojan horse" program that would allow a hacker to secretly gain access to
computer systems using the AT&amp;T Unix software and gather passwords used on the
system. The passwords could then be distributed to other hackers, permitting
them to use the system without the knowledge of its rightful operators,
prosecutors said.;    Rose's modifications made corporate purchasers of the
$77,000 AT&amp;T Unix program vulnerable to electronic break-ins and the theft of
such services as toll-free 800 numbers and other computer-based
telecommunications services.;    After changing the software, Rose sent it to
three other computer hackers, including one in Chicago, where authorities
learned of the scheme through a Secret Service computer crime investigation
called Operation Sun Devil. Officials say they do not believe the hackers ever
broke into computer systems.;    At the same time he pleaded guilty here, Rose
pleaded guilty to a similar charge in Chicago.;    Rose and his associates in
the Legion of Doom connected their computers by telephone to corporate and
government computer networks, outwitted security screens and passwords to sign
onto the systems and rummaged through the information files they found,
prosecutors said.  </TEXT>
