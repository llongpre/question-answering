<HEAD>Worried Lawrence Livermore Lab Asks For Hacker Contact</HEAD>

   A computer hacker who has breached
low-level security at a top federal weapons laboratory about 10
times in the past week is being urged by officials to contact the
lab ``to find out what he wants.''
   The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has spent nearly
$100,000 in lost resources and attempts to stop the invader, who
gains access through a national computer communications network, lab
officials estimated.
   No files or data in the computers appear to have been altered.
   ``I've offered an invitation for him to call me through the
media,'' said Charles Cole, the lab's computer security manager.
``I'd like to talk to him. My number's listed, or if he called the
laboratory he could get me very easily.''
   Lab officials also are considering trying to contact the hacker
the next time he logs onto their computers by leaving a message for
him.
   ``In one sense it would be nice if (the hacker) went away, but
I'd rather he stayed with us for a while so we can find out what he
wants,'' Cole said.
   ``What worries me is where is he (in the system) that we don't
know about,'' he added.
   The lab, run by the University of California Berkeley, is one of
the nation's two centers for design, manufacture and testing of
nuclear weapons. The other is at Los Alamos, N.M.
   No classified computer systems have been affected, Cole said.
   The hacker appeared in the lab's computers last weekend and has
been on and off the system ever since. The most recent appearance
was Thursday night, Cole said.
   ``As best we can determine, he hasn't altered anything with the
exception of creating a password for himself so he can get back
on,'' he said, adding:
   ``But he hasn't done anything really destructive on the system,
and before he would be inclined to do that I hope he would talk to
me about what his problem is.''
   The infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by a
computer ``virus'' that struck nationwide last month and by another
hacker two weeks ago. Both of the latest invasions were through
different holes in the system and there may yet be other access
points that have not been patched.
   Cole said the intrusions do not involve a virus, a program that
can order a computer to replicate itself or send it on to another
computer. ``This attack is being done by someone or a group who are
maneuvering into the system manually,'' he said.
   The hacker has already broken federal laws which prohibit
unauthorized use of federal computer systems, Cole said, and he may
have violated state laws as well.
   Cole speculated that the hacker is simply ``joy riding.''
   It was determined that Stanford University and the University of
Washington were gateways from which the hacker entered the Livermore
system by means of the Internet communications system, but it is not
known if the hacking originated there.
   Part of the problem in tracing a hacker on Internet is that it is
so large. Internet is used by research facilities and military
contractors nationwide and there is no single path through which
messages must travel.
   The lab has closed the holes which they believe the hacker used.
But a couple of computers have been left unprotected in an attempt
to make contact or trace the person.
   ``We could close up our system, in which case he would move on,''
Cole said.
