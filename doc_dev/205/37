<LEADPARA>  Beyond the reach of American law, a group of Dutch computer intruders has been
openly defying U.S. military, space and intelligence authorities for almost
six months.;    Recently they broke into a U.S. military computer while being
filmed by a crew from a Dutch television station.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The intruders, working over local telephone lines that enable them to tap
American computer networks at almost no cost, have not done serious damage,
federal investigators say.;    And they have not penetrated the most secure
government computer systems. But they have entered a wide range of computers,
including those at the Kennedy Space Center, the Pentagon's Pacific Fleet
Command, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Stanford University via an
international computer network known as the Internet.;    While the
information on these systems is not classified, the computers store a great
variety of material, including routine memorandums, unpublished reports and
data from experiments. Federal officials said the group had tampered with some
information stored on systems they have illegally entered.;    U.S. government
officials said they had been tracking the interlopers, but no arrests had been
made because there are no legal restrictions in the Netherlands barring
unauthorized computer access.;    "This has been a terrible problem," said
Gail Thackeray, a former Arizona assistant attorney general who has prosecuted
computer crimes. "Until recently there have been few countries that have
computer crime laws. These countries are acting as hacker havens.";    Dutch
TV report;  American law-enforcement officials said they believed there were
three or four members of the Dutch group, but would not release any names. A
Dutch television news report in February showed a member of the group at the
University of Utrecht reading information off a computer screen showing what
he said was missile test information taken electronically from a U.S. military
computer. His back was to the camera, and he was not named.;    Military and
intelligence agencies physically separate classified computer networks from
those used by businesses and researchers to protect the data from electronic
forays. When classified information is transmitted over unprotected computer
networks or telephone lines it must be specially coded.;    A Bay Area
computer expert with knowledge of classified systems said a large number of
unclassified computer programs that simulate the flight of missiles are
circulating on the Internet. The expert said the programs, many of them
decades old, are being updated by various programmers, and it is possible for
intruders on the Internet to easily discover them.;    But the expert, and
other computer security experts, say it is extremely unlikely the Dutch group
discovered any secret or highly sensitive military data in their break-ins.;  
 "Secret stuff isn't on the Internet," said Michael Odawa, a Mill Valley
programmer and computer security expert. "It's against the rules for anyone
with classified clearance to put that information on the Internet. If (the
Dutch group) found something secret, it's a gross exception to the rule.";   
No fear of punishment;  Because there are no computer crime laws in the
Netherlands, U.S. investigators said, members of the Dutch group boasted that
they could enter computers via international data networks with impunity.;   
But some of the intruders have been identified, and a federal official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there were numerous other criminal
offenses for which they could be prosecuted in both the United States and the
Netherlands. One possible charge might be telephone fraud.;    But legal
experts said that because there are no prohibitions against unauthorized
computer entry in the Netherlands successfully prosecuting the group may still
prove impossible.;    The case is significant, legal experts said, because
while the United States and many European countries have strict laws barring
illegal access to computers, there are many nations that have no computer
crime laws.;    Standardized law sought;  There is a proposed law before
parliament in the Netherlands that would make unauthorized computer access a
crime. Also, a governmental committee of the European Community is now working
to standardize computer crime laws in Europe.;    In the Netherlands case, the
group was detected last year after an unusually skilled U.S. government
computer researcher at a national laboratory tracked the group's every move.
He notified U.S. authorities of the break-ins.;    The researcher has been
able to make computer records of the intruders' keystrokes as they have
electronically prowled through U.S. military, NASA, university and dozens of
other computers. He then played this information back and gained an exact
picture of the computer screen as it appeared to the intruders in the
Netherlands.;    From 1986 to 1988 Clifford Stoll, an astronomer at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory, traced a similar group of West Germans, who were
illegally entering U.S. computers and selling computer data and software to a
Soviet intelligence officer.;    Suspended sentences;  Stoll was able to
persuade law enforcement officials to locate the group in West Germany and
three arrests were made. A German court eventually convicted them, but gave
them suspended sentences.;    The tactics of the Dutch group are of particular
interest to computer security experts because they have repeatedly used
security loopholes demonstrated by a program written by Robert T. Morris, a
Cornell University student, more than two years ago.;    Last month a federal
appeals court upheld the conviction of Morris, who in 1988 unleashed a program
that jammed several thousand computers in a nationwide network. He was
convicted of violating federal computer crime statutes and was fined $10,000
and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service.;    That the same
security flaws can be used to illicitly enter computers several years after
they were widely publicized indicates that many computer managers are still
paying only minimal attention to data security, computer security researchers
said.  </TEXT>
