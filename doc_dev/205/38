   A computer hacker broke into a Defense Department computer network and browsed through data at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory last month, a lab official said. 

   The breach occurred on the night of May 16, when a single unidentified operator used a legitimate password to break into a computer-aided engineering system, according to Haskell G. O'Brien, a manager of NASA's communications and computing network services section. 
The laboratory system is part of a general information-trading computer network, and Mr. O'Brien said none of the network's members contain classified information. 

   The hacker may have gained access to a Navy computer as well, but laboratory officials said they knew little about that attempt. 
It appeared that no data were damaged or copied from the NASA system. 

   The intrusion was the third attempt in about two years at the NASA facility. 
One of the earlier attempts was successful, but that intruder was identified, Mr. O'Brien said.
