   The U.S. government has tentatively concluded
that a spy ring of West German computer hackers did not gain access
to the types of secrets that would jeopardize America's national
security, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said he was
not at liberty to discuss the specific computer networks the German
hackers penetrated, what they learned in the process and what they
passed on to the Warsaw Pact.
   But, in breaking two weeks of official silence, Howard said the
Defense Department no longer viewed the case as a serious threat to
military security.
   ``Based on the information that we have thus far, and this is not
complete ... our best judgment is that the computer hackers did not
penetrate secure programs,'' Howard said.
   The initial review of evidence assembled by American and West
German authorities suggests the spy ring never gained access to the
computer systems that contain classified secrets, he continued.
   ``All this is subject to change should new information turn up in
the course of the investigation. But, to the best of our knowledge,
it does not appear at this point that there was any compromise of
classified information,'' Howard said.
   The West German government broke up the computer espionage
operation March 3, arresting three individuals and later disclosing
that eight others were still under investigation.
   On March 6, a spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor in West
Germany, Alexander Prechtel, told reporters the continuing
investigation suggested ``the information obtained by the hackers
does not appear to be that sensitive.''
   The U.S. government, however, had declined until Thursday to say
whether it agreed with that assessment.
   The West German ring was cracked in large measure through the
work of a lone U.S. computer expert, an astronomer named Clifford
Stoll. Stoll has said he observed the ring trying to break into
about 450 computer banks, and that the hackers did gain access to
the Pentagon's general data bank, named Optimus, as well as
computers at several defense contractors and U.S. military bases.
   West Germany's ARD television network has reported the hackers
also tapped NASA and ``Star Wars'' research computers. Citing
unidentified sources, the network reported that three hackers handed
over information from the United States, Japan, Britain, France,
Italy, Switzerland and West Germany during a 1985 meeting with two
KGB agents in East Berlin.
   The TV network also reported that authorities believe the West
German hackers were recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency in
1985 and ``were paid with cash and drugs.''
   Howard, while breaking the U.S. government's silence on the
matter, declined to confirm precisely which computer databanks the
hackers penetrated.
   ``No classified programs. That's really about all I can say on
the subject,'' he replied.
   ``I don't have any information that would imply there was any
involvement by Americans,'' Howard added.
