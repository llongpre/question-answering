   To the associate who turned him in, Kevin
David Mitnick is a ``big, fat slob'' obsessed with fast food and
breaking into computer systems.
   To the authorities holding him without bail, the 25-year-old Los
Angeles man is an expert hacker who calls himself Condor and is so
dangerous he must never be allowed to use even a telephone without
supervision.
   ``He is truly a threat to society, someone who uses computers to
act out personal vendettas against people,'' said Jim Black, a
computer crime specialist with the Police Department.
   ``The bottom line with Kevin is that if you have a job, pay a gas
bill, use a phone or drive a car he can find you and ruin you
electronically,'' Black said in a telephone interview. ``If he
wasn't in jail, he could be listening to us right this minute.'
   Mitnick was being held today in a maximum-security cell at the
federal Metropolitan Detention Center.
   A federal grand jury indicted him Dec. 20 on computer fraud
charges, accusing him of using unauthorized MCI long-distance codes
to tap into computers at Leeds University in England and the
University of Southern California and causing $4 million damage to a
Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.
   Mitnick will plead innocent, said his attorney, Alan Rubin.
   ``We will also try to get bail set,'' Rubin said. ``I am shocked
and astonished that my client is being held without bail and in
solitary confinement. This thing has been blown completely out of
proportion.''
   Longtime associate Leonard DiCicco, 23, of Calabasas, said he
reported Mitnick's activities to authorities because Mitnick had
been threatening him.
   ``He was using DEC computers where I work and threatening that we
would both go down if I said anything,'' said DiCicco, who faces no
charges in the inquiry.
   ``He has no sense of right or wrong and no respect for anyone
else's privacy,'' DiCicco said. ``I was beside him through all this
hacking and it's scary to think of the things he is capable of.''
   ``He could pick apart almost any computer system in the United
States,'' Black said. ``There are probably only a handful of
computer specialists with his capabilities.''
   In his electronic activities, the 5-11, 240-pound Mitnick
referred to himself as Condor, Black said. DiCicco said Mitnick
named himself for Robert Redford's character's code name in the spy
movie ``Three Days of the Condor.''
   ``All he did was eat Fat Burgers, drink Slurpees and work on
computers,'' DiCicco said. ``He was a big, fat slob of a guy who
couldn't get through a day without breaking into a computer
somewhere.''
   Mitnick began his hacking career using telephones, authorities
said. By age 13, he was under investigation by the police
department, Pacific Bell telephone company and the Federal
Communications Commission, the Los Angeles Daily News said Monday.
   ``Mitnick was a legend to the computer world by 1981,'' said John
Christ, his high school computer teacher.
   In 1982, DiCicco said, he and Mitnick used USC's 24-hour student
computer lab to get into many computers, including classified
systems.
   ``Our favorite was the National Security Agency computer because
it was supposed to be so confidential,'' DiCicco said. ``It was like
a big playground once you got into it.''
