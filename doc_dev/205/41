A SCHOOLBOY who allegedly hacked into a Financial Times computer which
stored data on share price indices caused considerable disruption at the
newspaper, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday.
Mr Paul Bedworth, now a student at Edinburgh University, hacked into the
FT's computer to use its account with BT to reach other computing systems,
the jury was told.
Mr Anthony Johnson, former head of computing services for the FT, said the
hacking was noticed in May 1991. Systems engineers discovered a dialling
program had been inserted. It made one telephone call a second and increased
the FT's telephone bill by Pounds 705.
Part of the system had to be removed for investigations which took weeks.
Fresh equipment had to be rented while this work was carried out. The total
cost of the hacking was Pounds 24,871.
The security system had been designed so that only users with a password
could deliver information to the computer.
The hacker was able to use a 'back door' in the system to gain entry to the
computer without such a password, he said. The back doors had been put into
the system for the convenience of engineers, but were not removed before the
computer was issued.
Mr Johnson denied a suggestion from Mr Ian MacDonald QC, defending, that the
FT's computer was a 'hacker's dream'. Such back doors would not usually be
known to users of the system, he said.
Mr Bedworth, from Ilkley, West Yorkshire, denies three conspiracy charges
under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 alleging unauthorised modification of
computer information, securing unauthorised access to computer information
and obtaining telegraphic services unlawfully.
The trial continues today.
