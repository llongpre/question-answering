   Three members of an underground group of computer
hackers that bilked telecommunications companies of money and
credit information pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges
Monday.
   The three are members of the ``Legion of Doom,'' a closely knit
group of about 15 computer hackers operating in Georgia, Texas,
Michigan, Illinois, Florida, New York and other states, said U.S.
Attorney Joe Whitley.
   Whitley said the group disrupted telecommunications, stole
computer source codes and information, stole credit information and
fraudulently obtained money and property.
   In May, authorities in Indiana who prosecuted a teen-ager
involved with the group called it an elite group of hackers that
accepted only the nation's best computer moles.
   The juvenile, who was not identified, pleaded guilty to 11
counts of fraud and agreed to testify against the Atlanta men in a
trial scheduled to begin Monday.
   Instead, the three pleaded guilty. They were identified as Adam
E. Grant, 22, and Robert J. Riggs, 22, both of Atlanta, and
Franklin E. Darden Jr., 24, of Norcross.
   Federal authorities charged that between Sept. 10, 1987, and
July 21, 1989, the three men illegally accessed various BellSouth
Co. computer systems and obtained valuable information that they
distributed to other hackers.
   Grant and Darden also monitored private telephone conversations,
Whitley said in a statement.
   They were charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, wire
fraud, access code fraud and interstate transportation of stolen
property.
   Darden and Riggs pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy each
and face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   Grant pleaded guilty to possessing 15 or more BellSouth access
devices with intent to defraud and faces a possible 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   A spokesman for BellSouth, Scott Ticer, said the operation cost
his company about $1.5 million, most of it for investigating and
changing access codes.
