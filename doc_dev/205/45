   A federal judge says she will order a computer
hacker to spend a year in a rehabilitation center to treat what was
called his addiction to computer tampering.
   Kevin Mitnick, who authorities had described as too dangerous to
be allowed near a telephone alone for fear he might access
computers, will be placed in the custody of Gateways Hospital's
rehabilitation program, U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer said
Monday.
   The judge said she will decide today whether Mitnick should also
be sentenced to prison. He was scheduled to be sentenced this
afternoon.
   Mitnick, 25, pleaded guilty in March to computer fraud and
possessing unauthorized long-distance telephone codes.
   He previously was convicted of using unauthorized MCI long
distance codes to tap into computers at Leeds University in England
and the University of Southern California, and of causing million of
dollars in damage to a Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.
   Both Harriet Rossetto, the rehabilitation program's director, and
Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said Mitnick's case was
the first they had heard of in which a person charged with computer
hacking had been treated as an addict.
   Ms. Rossetto testified that Mitnick has an ``impulse disorder,''
and would benefit from treatment. She said his illegal computer
activity gives him a sense of self-esteem he is otherwise lacking.
   ``This is a new and growing addiction,'' she said. ``There was no
greed involved. There was no sabotage involved.'
   ``It's something like climbing Mt. Everest,'' Asperger said. ``He
did it because it's there.''
