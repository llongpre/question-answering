   A computer hacker characterized as a program
pirate obsessed with cracking secret access codes was sentenced
Tuesday to a year in federal prison and six months rehabilitation.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer issued the prison sentence
after learning she could not place Kevin Mitnick in a
hospital-operated therapy program for what an expert witness called
Mitnick's ``impulse disorder.''
   The program is not under contract with the federal government,
said Grace Denton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney.
   ``A federal sentence has to be served in a federal facility,''
she said.
   Mitnick, who has been incarcerated at the federal Metropolitan
Detention Center downtown for seven months, need only serve five
more months in prison, Ms. Denton said.
   Mitnick, 25, pleaded guilty in May to computer fraud and
possessing unauthorized long-distance telephone codes. He will spend
six months in a residential therapy program after serving his prison
term.
   The charges stemmed from his use of stolen MCI long-distance
codes to tap into computers and copy valuable programs from Digital
Equipment Corp.
   After his prison term, Mitnick will be under conditional release
for three years. Mitnick will not be able to possess any illegal or
unauthorized access to computers or telecommunications equipment,
and will not be allowed to associate with known hackers. Another
condition states that he must complete a rehabilitation program.
   During his six months in a halfway house, Mitnick will be allowed
to either go to work or to treatment programs during the day, but he
must return to the halfway house at night, Ms. Denton said. He can
still have a personal computer.
   At one time, federal authorities considered Mitnick dangerous
enough to restrict his telephone use in jail. But Mitnick later
cooperated with authorities and apologized in court for his actions,
promising never to repeat them.
   Harriet Rossetto, a licensed social worker, testified that
Mitnick suffers from an impulse disorder and that his illegal
computer activity boosted his self-esteem.
   ``This is a new and growing addiction,'' she said. ``There was no
greed involved. There was no sabotage involved.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said that Mitnick's
activities were ``something like climbing Mount Everest.''
   ``He did it because it's there,'' said Asperger.
