   A computer hacker has breached
lower-level security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for
the 11th time in a week, officials said.
   The latest intrusion into the system took place Saturday, the lab
announced Monday.
   So far, the hacker has managed to invade the unclassified
research computer systems at the lab at least 11 times during the
past week.
   There have been no new intrusions since the weekend, Chuck Cole,
chief of the nuclear weapons facility, said through a spokesman.
   The spokesman, Ronald Teunis, said Cole could not comment
directly because he was ``exhausted'' from the hectic weeklong
invasion of the computer systems by the mysterious hacker.
   Cole had issued a public invitation to the hacker or hackers last
Saturday, asking to be contacted directly ``so I can see what he
wants.''
   Teunis said Cole has received several telephone calls from people
offering to help, but none was believed to be the hacker.
   He said the system involved is the UNIX network, which links
research labs and universities around the nation. The network, used
for unclassified scientific research, was the one invaded last month
by a computer virus believed released by a Cornell University
graduate student.
   The Livermore hacker has not invaded the lab's highly secret
nuclear weapons research computers, which are physically and
electronically separated from the unclassified system.
   Teunis said the hacker has not destroyed or altered any
information in the files, although the hacker apparently has the
capability of doing so.
   Cole emphasized earlier that the attacks do not involve a virus,
a program that invades a computer system and can clog its memory
system by overreproduction.
